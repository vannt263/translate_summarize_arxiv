    ", condensates of certain refractory elements are included in atmospheric layers where physical conditions favor such condensation . at the temperatures considered here the condensate clouds",
    "are located deep below the photosphere and the opacity of the clouds is ignored although grain condensation is still accounted for in the chemistry .",
    "the models also include vertical transport in the atmosphere , which significantly affects the chemical abundances of c- , n- and o - bearing species .",
    "the very stable molecules co and n@xmath13 are dredged up from deep layers to the photosphere , causing enhanced abundances of these species and decreased abundances of ch@xmath15 , h@xmath13o , and nh@xmath14 ( e.g. fegley & lodders 1996 , hubeny & burrows 2007 , saumon et al .",

    "the top panel shows that metallicity and gravity variations can affect the spectral energy distributions similarly  an increase in metallicity or a decrease in gravity leads to significantly increased flux in the @xmath54-band at 2.2 @xmath4 m , and decreased flux at 4.5 @xmath4 m ( impacting irac band 2 photometry for example ) .",

    "mid - infrared data will greatly help constrain its parameters .",
    "such data are needed to confirm the temperature implications of the near - infrared indices , and will also constrain metallicity and gravity by fixing the scaling of the models and restricting the slope of the near - infrared flux distribution .",

    "we find strong evidence that photospheric mixing continues to be an important process , even at these cool temperatures .",
    "any 5 @xmath4 m survey for y dwarfs ( e.g. wise or spitzer warm missions ) must take this mixing into account , as the flux will be less than predicted by equilibrium chemistry .",
    "considering the complexity of the atmospheres , the models reproduce the data well .",
    "however there are known deficiencies in the molecular opacity line lists , and discrepancies can be seen in figures 4  6 and 8 .",
    "the known problems are large at @xmath36 m @xmath37 , where the line list for ch@xmath15 is incomplete , the line list for nh@xmath14 does not exist , and where treatment of the red wing of the very broad 0.77 @xmath4 m k  i line is difficult .",
    "these problems most likely account for the excess model flux seen in our fits at @xmath83 m @xmath84 .",
    "given these deficiencies , the systematic errors in our derived parameters are difficult to determine .",
    "however , the good agreement with evolutionary models for the @xmath7800 k brown dwarf companions to stars of known age and metallicity means that it is unlikely that the errors are larger than 100 k in @xmath10 , or a factor of two in gravity and metallicity ( see the trends shown in figures 3 and 7 ) .",
    "nevertheless it is of paramount importance that the line lists for ch@xmath15 and nh@xmath14 are improved , now that objects as cool as 500 k are being discovered .",
    "it is also very helpful at these low temperatures to have mid - infrared observational data .",
    "the absorption features in the near - infrared are effectively saturated , and the changes with temperature have become subtle .",
    "the mid - infrared flux level is very sensitive to temperature and can remove this degeneracy ; this sensitivity increases with decreasing temperature as shown in figure 7 .",
    "mid - infrared data offers the possibility of identifying low - temperature systems such as 2mass j0939@xmath224 , which may be a 500 k @xmath3 700 k brown dwarf pair .",
    "we find that two of the three currently known t9 dwarfs have @xmath85 k @xmath86 and the third appears to be even cooler with @xmath87 k @xmath88 .",
    "vertical transport of gas remains significant even at these very low temperatures , so that enhanced co opacity reduces the flux at 4.5  @xmath4 m and decreased nh@xmath14 opacity increases the flux at 9  15 @xmath4 m .",
    "the evolutionary models show that the parameters we derive for ulas j0034@xmath200 and ulas j1335@xmath311 imply that they are both very low mass and relatively young  their masses are between 5 and 20 m@xmath89 corresponding to an age range of 0.1 to 2.0 gyr .",
