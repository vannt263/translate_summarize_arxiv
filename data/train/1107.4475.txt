    "<S> it is assumed that the current cosmic acceleration is driven by a scalar field , the lagrangian of which is a function of the kinetic term only , and that the luminosity distance is a given function of the red - shift . upon comparison with baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data the parameters of the models are determined , and then the time evolution of the scalar field is determined by the dynamics using the cosmological equations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the solution is very different than the corresponding solution when the non - relativistic matter is ignored , and that the universe enters the acceleration era at larger red - shift compared to the standard @xmath0 model .    </S>",
    "<S> according to our current understanding about the cosmos , we live in a flat universe which expands in an accelerating rate and it is dominated by a dark component . </S>",
    "<S> identifying the origin and nature of dark energy is one of the biggest challenges for modern cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> since we can only speculate about what dark energy could be , many cosmological models have been proposed and studied so far . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest candidate is a cosmological constant with state parameter @xmath1 , but models with a dynamical component with an evolving state parameter @xmath2 also exist in the literature ( for a review on dark energy models see e.g.  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> scalar field models with a non - canonical kinetic term have been discussed in k - inflation  @xcite , in which inflation is not due to the potential , but rather to the kinetic term in the lagrangian , and in k - essence models .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which are designed to address the issue why the cosmic acceleration has recently begun . </S>",
    "<S> very recently , in  @xcite the authors studied a k - essence model assuming i ) a closed form parameterization for the luminosity distance ( for distances in cosmology see e.g.  @xcite ) , proposed previously in  @xcite , and ii ) that the lagrangian of the scalar field does not depend on the field itself . </S>",
    "<S> however , in that work the matter has been ignored , and in the present article we wish to show that if the presence of matter is also taken into account , the time evolution of the scalar field is very different . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that according to this model , the universe enters the acceleration era at a larger red - shift compared to the standard @xmath0 model .    </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical framework is basically the same as in  @xcite , apart from the inclusion of matter in the cosmological equations , and the use of baos and cmb data to be mentioned later on . </S>",
    "<S> however , we start by giving a summary of all the ingredients we shall be using , so that the present work is self - contained . </S>",
    "<S> we focus here on the case of a flat universe , since this is a robust prediction of inflation  @xcite , and it is also supported by current data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the framework is based on four - dimensional general relativity coupled to a single scalar field with a general lagrangian @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the scalar field and @xmath5 is the standard kinetic term . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our model is described by the action @xmath6 the energy - momentum tensor for the scalar field is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we can recast this energy - momentum tensor into the form of the energy - momentum tensor for a perfect fluid @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the energy density and the pressure of the fluid respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the hydrodynamical quantities @xmath12 are given in terms of @xmath13 as follows @xmath14 therefore , the equations of motion for the system gravity+scalar field are just the first friedmann equation and the equation for energy conservation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the hubble parameter , @xmath17 is the scale factor and the overdot denotes differentiation with respect to cosmic time . defining the sound speed of the scalar field </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 the equation for energy conservation takes the form @xmath19 which generalizes the usual klein - gordon equation of a canonical scalar field in a friedmann - robertson - walker background .    </S>",
    "<S> if we now include also the non - relativistic matter , the equations of motion for our system are the friedmann equations and the conservation equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is newtons constant , @xmath23 is the energy density of matter ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 are the energy density and pressure of dark energy respectively , @xmath26 is the total energy density and @xmath27 is the total pressure . assuming no interaction between dark energy and non - relativistic matter , we have two seperate conservation equations @xmath28 where the second equation for dark energy is equivalent to the equation of motion of the scalar field . if we further assume that the lagrangian of the scalar field depends on the kinetic term only , @xmath29 , the equation of motion can be integrated once @xmath30 where @xmath31 is an arbitrary integration constant , which later on will be taken to be @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the derivative of @xmath34 with respect to the kinetic term . </S>",
    "<S> all in all , there are three independent equations , namely the equation of the scalar field , the conservation equation for dust , and the second friedmann equation . for a given hubble parameter as a function of the red - shift @xmath35 , the time evolution of the scalar field can be found using the set of the basic cosmological equations . </S>",
    "<S> this will be useful later on ( see equations ( 29 ) and ( 30 ) , as well as the definitions ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of a theoretical model against supernovae data relies on the minimization of @xmath36 with @xmath37 the distance modulus , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the absolute magnitude and @xmath40 is the apparent magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical apparent magnitude @xmath41 as a function of the red - shift @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 where the luminosity distance @xmath44 for a flat universe can be expressed as @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the speed of light , while @xmath35 is the hubble parameter as a function of the redshift .    </S>",
    "<S> we also exploit the cmb shift parameter @xmath47 , since it is the least model dependent quantity extracted from the cmb power spectrum , i.e. it does not depend on the present value of the hubble parameter @xmath48 . the reduced distance @xmath47 is written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is todays value of the matter normalized density , and we use the cmb shift parameter value @xmath51 , as derived in  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> independent geometrical probes are baryon acoustic oscillations measurements . acoustic oscillations in the photon - baryon plasma are imprinted in the matter distribution . </S>",
    "<S> these baos have been detected in the spatial distribution of galaxies by the sdss  @xcite at a redshift @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the sdss team reports its bao measurement in terms of the @xmath53 parameter @xmath54 where the function @xmath55 is defined to be @xmath56 and we have used the value @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> we shall assume that the scalar field lagrangian , @xmath29 , is chosen so that the solution of the cosmological equations for the hubble parameter @xmath35 leads to the luminosity distance @xmath58 then the cmb shift parameter as well as the bao @xmath53 parameter , for a given matter density @xmath50 , are certain functions of the two parameters @xmath59 , and if we require that @xmath60 and @xmath61 the two parameters can be determined . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath62 we find that the model is viable as long as the two free parameters take the values @xmath63 and furthermore the distance modulus @xmath37 can not be distinguished from the corresponding quantity when the matter is ignored , see figure 1 below .     and @xmath64 ( dashed line ) , and b ) our model including matter with @xmath62 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( solid line ) . </S>",
    "<S> ]    to find the time evolution of the scalar field , we introduce the dimensionless scalar field and time as follows @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the age of the universe today , and we use the second friedmann equation . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensionless time @xmath69 as a function of the red - shift is given by @xmath70 while the dimensionless field @xmath71 as a function of the red - shift is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 , and is given in terms of the assumed ( dimensionless ) luminosity distance @xmath74 by @xmath75 with @xmath59 having the values determined before , and we have used that @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , eliminating the red - shift we obtain @xmath71 as a function of @xmath69 , and the solution can be seen in figure 2 below . in the same figure </S>",
    "<S> we also show the polynomial of second degree that best fits the solution @xmath77 in the same interval , which is the following @xmath78 we see that the solution exhibits a global minimum at @xmath79 , which corresponds to a red - shift @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the value for which the two terms in ( [ eqn ] ) cancel eachother .     in our model including matter with @xmath62 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( solid line ) , and the polynomial of second degree @xmath81 that best fits the solution ( dashed line ) . ]    before ending our discussion , let us compare the deceleration parameter @xmath82 of the standard @xmath0 model with that of our model . </S>",
    "<S> using the definitions , the deceleration parameter as a function of the red - shift is given by @xmath83 and can be seen in figure 3 , where for @xmath0 we have used the values @xmath84 . in our model the universe enters into the acceleration era at @xmath85 , while in the standard cosmological model this takes place at later times .     </S>",
    "<S> model with @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( dashed line ) , and b ) our model including matter with @xmath62 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( solid line ) . ]    in summary , in the present work we have assumed that the current cosmic acceleration is driven by a scalar field , the lagrangian of which is a function of the kinetic term only , and that the luminosity distance is a given function of the red - shift . </S>",
    "<S> upon comparison with baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data the parameters of the models are determined , and then the time evolution of the scalar field is obtained by integrating the cosmological equations numerically . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the solution is very different than the corresponding solution when the non - relativistic matter is ignored , and that the universe enters the acceleration era at larger red - shift compared to the standard @xmath0 model . </S>"
