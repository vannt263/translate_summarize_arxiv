    "partially motivated by their possible applications in quantum information technology , recent years have seen a huge interest@xcite in the realization of majorana fermions in condensed - matter systems both from theoretical and experimental groups .",
    "one recent experimental work  @xcite performed scanning tunneling experiments on ferromagnetic atomic chains on a superconducting substrate and observed a strongly localized conductance signal around the edges indicative of majorana edge modes . in fact , the localization at the edges was even stronger than expected.@xcite in this context the interactions in the system played an important role , i.e. , the experimental system was non - surprisingly more complicated than the simple kitaev chain@xcite usually serving as a toy model for the emergence of majorana edge modes in solid - state systems .",
    "there has been a broad interest in how experimental deviations from the clean , non - interacting setup affect the majorana edge states in the kitaev chain as well as systems akin to it .",
    "two of the most relevant experimental influences are disorder@xcite and interactions.@xcite concerning the effects of disorder it has been observed that moderate disorder supports the topological phase by pinning down quasiparticles associated to the phase transition , which has especially been investigated for the two - dimensionsional toric code.@xcite similarly , it has been shown@xcite that repulsive interactions generically broaden the window of chemical potentials over which the topological phase and thus majorana fermions exist .",
    "much less is known on the combined effect of disorder and interactions , which has so far only been investigated in topological quantum wires . performing a renormalization - group analysis of the corresponding bosonized low - energy theory in replica space , lobos et al .",
    "@xcite showed that disorder and repulsive interactions reinforce each other in suppressing the topological phase and thus eliminating majorana edge modes in the wires .",
    "crpin et al.@xcite corroborated this finding using a gaussian variational approach .    here",
    "we will analyze the combined effect of disorder and interactions in a microscopic model , namely a generalized kitaev / majorana chain .",
    "specifically , we consider a one - dimensional chain of spinless fermions in the presence of p - wave superconducting pairing , nearest - neighbor interactions , and a disordered chemical potential .",
    "while the special cases of the interacting model without disorder@xcite as well as the non - interacting , disordered@xcite model have been studied previously and can be investigated by analytical methods , the combined effect of interactions and disorder is not amenable to analytic methods .",
    "thus we employ the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method@xcite to calculate several observables from which we determine the phase boundary between the topological and trivial phases .",
    "we find that moderate disorder stabilizes the topological order in the non - interacting as well as interacting model .",
    "however , strong disorder leads to a suppression of the topological phase which is amplified by both repulsive and attractive interactions .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in the next section we define the system and discuss its main properties , including the appearance of majorana edge states and its mapping to a spin chain . in sec .",

    "[ sec : interplay - of - disorder ] we present our main results on the phase diagram in the presence of interactions and disorder , see figs .  [ fig : disorder - interaction - compare ] and  [ fig : pd2 ] , before we conclude .",
    "in order to investigate the interplay of disorder and interactions and their influence on the stability of topological phases we consider an extension of the well - known kitaev / majorana chain  @xcite , namely @xmath0 where the operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 annihilate or create a spinless fermion at lattice site @xmath3 respectively . the first term describes hopping of the fermions between neighboring sites , the second is a p - wave superconducting pairing , and the third term represents an interaction term between fermions on neighboring sites .",
    "the corresponding amplitudes @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are assumed to be real ( furthermore we assume @xmath4 and @xmath5 to be positive ) and constant along the chain .",
    "in contrast , the chemical potential @xmath7 in the last term is allowed to be site dependent and thus to contain disorder . throughout this manuscript",
    "we assume the values @xmath7 to stem from a uniform disorder distribution with mean value @xmath8 and variance @xmath9 , i.e. , the @xmath7 are uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath10 .",
    "the generalization to other disorder distributions is straightforward ; we do not expect any qualitative changes of our results . unless stated differently , we assume an open chain of length @xmath11 .",
    "for the later discussion it is useful to rewrite the hamiltonian in two different ways ( see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "first , we can introduce two majorana fermions @xmath12 and @xmath13 at each lattice site via @xmath14 .",
    "the majorana fermions satisfy the algebra @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in terms of these",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath20\\nonumber\\\\ & & -u\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\gamma_{i , a}\\gamma_{i , b}\\gamma_{i+1,a}\\gamma_{i+1,b}-\\frac{{\\text{i}}}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\mu_{i}\\gamma_{i , a}\\gamma_{i , b}.\\label{eq : majorana - hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the appearance of majorana edge zero modes is most easily seen in the homogeneous , non - interacting model at @xmath21 . denoting the chemical potential by @xmath22 it is straightforward to show@xcite that the operator @xmath23 commutes with the hamiltonian up to terms exponentially small in the system size provided @xmath24 .",
    "obviously , @xmath25 is localized at the left boundary ; the majorana edge mode at the right boundary can be constructed analogously .",
    "the condition @xmath24 is also sufficient@xcite for the existence of majorana edge modes for @xmath26 ( as long as @xmath27 ) and hence determines the topological phase in the clean , non - interacting system .",
    "alternatively , the model can be mapped to a spin - chain hamiltonian via the jordan  wigner transformation @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 with the result @xmath31\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\mu_{i}\\sigma_i^z , \\label{eq : spin - hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath32 , @xmath33 , denote the usual pauli matrices . in the homogeneous , non - interacting limit this simplifies to the well - known xy model in a magnetic field . for @xmath24",
    "this model is in its ordered phase with @xmath34 , which corresponds to the topological phase of the kitaev chain .",
    "the relation between the local order parameter in the spin - chain representation and the non - local topological order in the kitaev chain is given by the non - local jordan ",
    "wigner transformation.@xcite    in the following sections we discuss the phase diagram of the clean , interacting system followed by the non - interacting , disordered one .",
    "we then turn to the investigation of their combined effect .",
    "the phase diagram of the interacting kitaev chain without disorder , i.e. , the model with @xmath35 , has been determined@xcite employing the equivalent spin - chain representation .",
    "it was shown that the topological and trivial phases of the non - interacting model extend to weak and moderate repulsive and attractive interaction strengths . at large repulsions ,",
    "@xmath36 , additional incommensurate and commensurate charge - density wave phases ( mott insulator ) exist .",
    "in this article we focus on weak and moderate interactions . in order to obtain quantitative results on the phase boundary between the topological and trivial phase we diagonalize the non - interacting hamiltonian ( assuming periodic boundary conditions ) using a standard bogoliubov transformation ( see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "the critical chemical potential @xmath37 is then determined in perturbation theory in @xmath6 from the condition that the excitation gap closes ; the result reads@xcite @xmath38+\\mathcal{o}(u^2)\\nonumber\\\\ & \\approx&2t+\\left[\\frac{32}{3\\pi}-\\frac{32}{15\\pi}\\frac{\\delta - t}{t}\\right]u+\\mathcal{o}(u^2 ) , \\label{eq : linear - extrpolated - delta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the last line we have expanded also to leading order in @xmath39 .",
    "the perturbative result has been confirmed numerically .",
    "the linear approximation with respect to @xmath39 works surprisingly well even for appreciable deviations of the order of @xmath40 .",
    "we stress that repulsive interactions stabilize the topological phase in the sense that @xmath37 increases with @xmath6 .",
    "we note that a pair coupling deviating from @xmath41 causes no shift of @xmath42 in the absence of interactions while for the interacting model the sign of the shift also depends on the sign of the interaction @xmath6",
    ". the absence of any effect of @xmath26 on @xmath37 in the non - interacting case can be understood from the majorana representation : the coupling @xmath43 binds majorana fermions on neighboring fermionic sites @xmath3 and @xmath44 and thus acts qualitatively similar to the first term in favoring the formation of majorana edge modes .",
    "finite interactions , however , influence this binding between neighboring sites , thus causing a correction in @xmath37 .",
    "now let us turn to the non - interacting model with disorder in the chemical potential .",
    "the phase diagram can be obtained by considering a semi - infinite chain and applying a transfer - matrix approach@xcite to search for states that decay when moving away from the edge .",
    "this leads to the criterion for the existence of majorana edge states @xmath45 1 & 0 \\end{array}\\right ) , \\qquad \\max\\{|\\lambda_{t}|\\}<1 , \\label{eq : transfermatrix}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 denotes the eigenvalues of @xmath47 .",
    "for the special case @xmath21 the structure of the matrices multiplied in the construction of @xmath47 simplifies and one obtains in the infinite - size limit @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the probability distribution for the @xmath7 with mean value @xmath8 and variance @xmath9 . for special probability distributions like the uniform , gaussian , or cauchy  lorentz distribution",
    "the left - hand side of can be evaluated analytically . in the spin - chain context",
    "the condition determines the phase boundary in the quantum ising chain with disordered transverse field.@xcite if additionally the tunnel coupling @xmath4 is disordered ( but uncorrelated to the disorder in @xmath7 ) , one has to include a disorder average on the right - hand side of as well .     for different values of the pairing strength @xmath5 .",
    "if , for a given standard deviation @xmath50 , the mean chemical potential @xmath8 is below ( above ) the critical value @xmath37 , the system is in the topological ( trivial ) phase . the data are obtained from the transfer - matrix approach considering @xmath51 sites . ]    the criterion on the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix can also be used the determine the phase boundary for @xmath26 , although no closed result replacing exist .",
    "we plot the resulting phase diagram for different values of @xmath5 in fig .  [",
    "fig : non - interacting ] . we observe that under a reduction of @xmath5 the topological phase shrinks , while increasing @xmath5 stabilizes it against stronger disorder in the chemical potential .",
    "we also observe that the value of @xmath37 at @xmath52 is unaffected as predicted by the result .",
    "in the remainder of this paper we will analyze the interplay of interactions and disorder in the chemical potential .",
    "to this end we will calculate several observables using the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method.@xcite in this section we give a list of possible criteria to determine the phase boundary between the topological and trivial phase and discuss their practical applicability to the problem at hand .",
    "the simplest possible criterion is the closing of the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state .",
    "this criterion works very well for the clean system as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu - dependence](a ) .",
    "however , the presence of disorder may lead to localized zero - energy modes , resulting in the closing of the energy gap without a phase transition in the bulk of the system [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : mu - dependence](b ) ] , thus rendering the criterion unreliable . a related criterion , namely the compressibility @xmath53 , was discussed recently@xcite and shown to be insensitive to finite - size effects .",
    "however , in the disordered case the compressibility shows the same problems as the energy gap .",
    "thus we conclude that both criteria are not suitable for the determination of the phase boundary in the presence of disorder .",
    "the second possible criterion is the relative change of the wave function overlap when changing @xmath22related to the fidelity@xcite@xmath54 .",
    "this parameter also turns out to be very stable in the clean case but gets insensitive to the phase transition for strong disorder as it also tends to be sensitive for the closure of the energy gap .",
    "another possible criterion is based on the non - interacting picture@xcite discussed above .",
    "one considers the overlap @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the ground state in the even or odd parity sector , respectively , which are connected via the zero - energy majorana edge state associated with @xmath57 .",
    "hence , this expectation value will be of order one in the topological phase but will vanish in the trivial phase , i.e. , we find @xmath58 the limiting factor for this approach is mainly the need to access both ground states @xmath56 , which comes at higher numerical costs than criterion 5 discussed below . furthermore , when determining the ground states one has to ensure that one obtains the true ground states in the respective parity sectors and not some localized zero - energy state due to ( strong ) disorder .",
    "in addition , as exemplified in fig .  [ fig : mu - dependence](b ) the majorana edge state overlap possesses strong fluctuations inside the topological region which make a reliable extraction of the phase boundaries very hard .",
    "a criterion often used to identify topological phases is the degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum@xcite , i.e. , the spectrum of @xmath59 , with the ground - state density matrix @xmath60 , which is two - times degenerate in the topological phase .",
    "hence its gap may be used as criterion , which turns out to be robust against disorder , i.e. , it does not detect spurious localized zero - energy states . while this criterion is generally easily accessible with dmrg algorithms , it requires some effort to be numerically stable regarding the number of kept states @xmath61 ( see sec .",
    "[ sub : implementation ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] ) . to sample many disorder realizations in an affordable time",
    "we therefore did not apply this criterion .",
    "however , we show for an exemplary case in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu - dependence](b ) that it agrees with criterion 5 to be discussed in the following .",
    "[ see eq .",

    "( a ) clean system with @xmath35 .",
    "( b ) exemplary disorder configuration with mean value @xmath8 . while in the clean system the four criteria agree and give the correct value @xmath64 for the phase boundary , in the disordered case the energy gap shows significant deviations due to localized zero - energy bulk states while the majorana edge state overlap possesses strong fluctuations . on the other hand",
    ", the correlation function and the entanglement gap give the same result .",
    "the simulations were performed with @xmath21 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 kept states.,title=\"fig : \" ]   [ see eq .  ] , entanglement gap @xmath62 , energy gap @xmath63 above the ground state , and majorana edge state overlap .",

    "the simulations were performed with @xmath21 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 kept states.,title=\"fig : \" ]    \\5 .",
    "finally , let us devise the criterion we are going to use for our numerical calculations . as mentioned above",
    ", the topological phase corresponds to the magnetically ordered phase in the spin - chain representation , thus we start with the correlation function of the corresponding order parameter @xmath67 in the clean case , this function behaves as follows : in the trivial region @xmath68",
    "one finds that @xmath69 decays as@xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 and the correlation length is given by @xmath72 . in contrast , in the topological region @xmath24 the correlation function @xmath69 saturates at a constant value close to unity as @xmath73 .",
    "we will now use this behavior to construct a parameter which has a rather sharp transition at the critical point @xmath74 and most importantly is robust against disorder .    to this end",
    "we consider the functions @xmath75 i.e. , we consider the mean of the correlations between the @xmath76 leftmost sites with the respective ones at distance @xmath77 .",
    "for @xmath78 we obtain a sharp transition from @xmath79 in the trivial to @xmath80 in the topological phase .",
    "we note that both interactions [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : mu - dependence](a ) ] as well as spatial fluctuations in the individual samples due to the disorder [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : mu - dependence](b ) ] yield a reduction from the value @xmath81 , however , considering the sum of the correlation functions @xmath82 ensures that rare fluctuations on individual sites due to the disorder are smoothed out .    while the correlation function is local in the spin - chain representation , the jordan  wigner string results in a non - local expression in terms of the fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , in terms of the majorana operators one finds @xmath83 for @xmath84 the jordan  wigner string obviously vanishes and @xmath85 just corresponds to the expectation value of finding majorana fermions bound at neighboring sites . for @xmath73",
    ", however , the string is essential to get a non - vanishing @xmath86 in the topological phase , reflecting the fact that the topological order is encoded in non - local properties of the fermionic model .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu - dependence ] we compare the energy gap @xmath63 , the gap in the entanglement spectrum @xmath62 , the majorana edge state overlap , and the function @xmath87 for two examples of interacting systems . while for the clean system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu - dependence](a ) all four criteria indicate the same critical chemical potential @xmath64 , in the disordered system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu - dependence](b ) the critical chemical potential extracted from the energy gap shows significant deviations due to localized zero - energy states .",
    "similarly , the majorana edge state overlap possesses strong fluctuations in the disordered system . on the other hand ,",
    "the results obtained from the entanglement gap and @xmath88 are identical , while the calculation of the latter turns out to be numerically less demanding ( see sec .",
    "[ sub : implementation ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] ) .",
    "we conclude that using the function provides a stable tool to detect the phase transition between the topological and trivial phases in the presence of both interactions and disorder .",
    "as discussed in the previous section only the gap in the entanglement spectrum @xmath62 and the function @xmath89 turned out to be robust with respect to strong disorder .",
    "the main advantage of the latter is that it is much less affected by truncation errors in the dmrg calculations , in particular in the strongly disordered case .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] : the entanglement gap @xmath62 shows fluctuations which may lead to accidental degeneracies in particular for small matrix dimensions @xmath61 , thus increasing the uncertainty in the determination of the topological phase . in contrast , the result for the function @xmath90 only weakly changes with @xmath61 , and yields reliable results@xcite already for small matrix dimension @xmath66 thus reducing the time to simulate many disorder realizations . hence in the following we use the criterion @xmath91 to determine the topological phase .",
    "the function @xmath92 depends implicitly on the mean @xmath8 via the randomly distributed chemical potentials @xmath93 .",

    "we generate a set of randomly distributed chemical potentials @xmath95 from a uniform distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation @xmath96 .",
    "the random chemical potentials @xmath93 are given as quenched disorder and are therefore not altered during the following procedure .",
    "now we introduce an auxiliary parameter @xmath97 by shifting the randomly distributed chemical potentials , i.e. , @xmath98 , and determine the two points @xmath99 by evaluating the positions with @xmath100 .",
    "the critical mean value of the chemical potential is then set to @xmath101 .",
    "the use of this symmetrized procedure nullifies random shifts of the center of the topological region , which have to average out to zero anyhow due to the symmetry of the problem under @xmath102 .",
    "the function @xmath103 is determined using a dmrg calculation with truncation at @xmath66 states .",
    "we repeat step 1 for @xmath104 disorder realizations denoted by @xmath105 , @xmath106 ( we use @xmath107 throughout ) .",
    "we use post - selection to ensure that the mean values @xmath108 of the @xmath104 realizations represent the corresponding gaussian distribution.@xcite we only discard a drawn disorder configuration if already another one within the same acceptance limits for @xmath109 has been drawn before .",
    "once we have obtained a valid disorder realization we calculate the critical chemical potential as in step 2 , the final result for @xmath37 being the mean value of the critical chemical potentials of the @xmath104 disorder realizations .",
    "we decided to determine the critical chemical potential @xmath37 for each disorder realization , followed by averaging of @xmath104 realizations .",
    "instead one may consider averaging the correlation functions over the disorder realizations , @xmath110 , and then searching for the critical chemical potential .",
