    "in recent years , the ultrathin graphite films , i.e. @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) stacked graphene layers ( nsgl s ) , are successfully fabricated.@xcite extensive studies have been devoted to these systems due to their competitive capability for the design of novel nano - devices .",
    "it s desirable to carry out a through symmetry analysis to figure out the corresponding electron and phonon spectra , and to reveal the relevant selection rules and the optical activities .",
    "moreover , to our knowledge , although there are some studies on the electronic structure,@xcite no existing works concern the phonon dispersions for the nsgl s .",
    "recently it is reported that the frequencies of optical c - c stretching mode in the nsgl s decrease with increasing @xmath0.@xcite the amplitude of this red shift is about @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and 8  @xmath4 in these three experiments respectively .",
    "theoretical explanation of this red shift is required .    in this paper ,",
    "the symmetry analysis is referred for both the ab- and aa - stacked lattice structures , while the latter has the point group @xmath5 irrespective of the even - oddness of @xmath0 .",
    "we classify the phonon normal modes at @xmath6 point and determine their raman and infra - red ( ir ) properties .",
    "we generalize the force constant model of graphene@xcite into nsgl s and it can be applied to calculate the phonon dispersions for the nsgl s in ab- or aa - stacking with arbitrary layer number @xmath0 .    for the intra - layer optical c - c stretching mode with frequency around 1600  @xmath4 , it is raman active for all nsgl s and the calculated frequencies exhibit layer - number dependence as that the frequency decreases with @xmath0 increasing .",
    "the red shift values for the ab- ( aa- ) stacked systems are about 2  @xmath4 ( 4  @xmath4 ) which are in consistent with the experimental measurements . in the medium frequency range around 800  @xmath4 ,",
    "the out - of - plane optical mode is ir active for ab - stacked structure but neither raman nor ir active in aa - stacking .",
    "its frequency behaviors a blue shift as layer number increasing .",
    "there is an interesting inter - layer optical mode in the low frequency region which is raman active in the nsgl s with @xmath0 even ( ensgl s ) while ir active in nsgl s with @xmath0 odd ( oensgl s ) .",
    "its frequency value depends on the layer number @xmath0 more sensitively and increases from 106  @xmath4 ( 94.5  @xmath4 ) to 149.8  @xmath4 ( 133.6  @xmath4 ) for the ab- ( aa- ) stacked nsgl s , which is of an order less than those intra - layer optical modes .",
    "phonon dispersions for the aa - stacked 3-dimensional ( 3d ) graphite are also discussed .",

    "[ 1.4 ]    it is known that graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms with the honeycomb lattice configuration which is characterized by the @xmath5 symmetry.@xcite the 3d graphite is ab - stacked honeycomb lattice , where the b layers are achieved by shifting the a layers along one of its first - nearest carbon - carbon bonds in the horizontal plane as shown in fig .  [ fig : unitcell](a ) .",
    "the space group of the 3d graphite is non - symmorphic group @xmath7 with non - primitive translation @xmath8 ( primitive translation @xmath9).@xcite the distance between two adjacent layers is about @xmath10 which is much larger than the bond length between two nearest - neighbor atoms in the plane , @xmath11 .",
    "the ngsl s are also constructed by ab - stacked honeycomb lattice , but with limited number of layers . although the structures of each layer of 3d graphite and nsgl s are the same , the corresponding symmetry groups are different since the displacement symmetry along @xmath12 axis no longer exists for nsgl s , so does the symmetry associated with @xmath13 .",
    "now the symmetry group becomes a direct product of a 3d point group and a 2d translational group .",
    "and the point groups are different for ensgl s and onsgl s as mentioned in ref .  .",
    "for the ensgl s , a center of inversion @xmath14 occurs in the middle of atom 4 in the @xmath15-th layer and 5 in the @xmath16-th layer as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : unitcell](a ) .",
    "there are one 3-fold main axis in the direction perpendicular to the layers and three 2-fold axes , @xmath17 , perpendicular to the main axis and at angles of @xmath18 to each other .",
    "all these symmetry operations together constitute the point group @xmath19 . in the onsgl s , instead of a center of inversion",
    "there is a reflection symmetry @xmath20 with the middle layer as its reference plane .",
    "a 3-fold main axis exists in the direction of @xmath21-axis and three 2-fold axes , @xmath22 , are perpendicular to it .",
    "we notice that these three 2-fold axes @xmath22 are one to one perpendicular to those of @xmath17 .",
    "consequently , the symmetry group for the onsgl s is @xmath23 .",
    "the environments for an atom in the graphite and nsgl s are different from that in 2d graphene . for each carbon atom in the graphene layer , there are three nearest - neighbor carbon atoms and six next - nearest- neighbors",

    "we notice here that in the aa - stacked 3d graphite , there are only two atoms in the unit cell and the primitive translation along @xmath24-axis is @xmath27 , which is half of the correspondence in the ab - stacked 3d graphite .",
    "the dynamical representation @xmath28 can be decomposed into the irreducible representations of the symmetry group , with the lattice displacements as the bases , where @xmath29 is the vector representation and @xmath30 is the permutation representation of the group . by applying the projection operator technique ,",
    "we carry out the decomposition of the dynamical representation into the irreducible representations for the nsgl s with @xmath0 even and odd respectively . according to elliott,@xcite",
    "the ir active phonon modes belong to the irreducible representations decomposed from the vector representation @xmath29 , while the raman active modes correspond to the irreducible representations shown up in the decomposition of a six - dimensional representation with bases as the quadratic forms : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
