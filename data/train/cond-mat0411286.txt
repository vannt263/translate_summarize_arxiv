    "consider the stochastic process @xmath0 corresponding to the zero - temperature limit of glauber dynamics for a ferromagnetic ising model with hamiltonian @xmath8 here @xmath9 denotes a sum over nearest neighbor sites only and @xmath10 , the @xmath11-dimensional hypercubic lattice .",
    "so @xmath0 takes values in @xmath12 , the space of infinite - volume spin configurations on @xmath13 .",
    "the process @xmath0 can be interpreted as modelling the nonequilibrium dynamical evolution of a classical ising ferromagnet following a deep quench .",
    "perhaps the most basic question that can be asked is whether the process @xmath0 settles down to a limit as @xmath14 .",
    "knowledge of this fundamental long - time property is a prerequisite for studying persistence properties  @xcite , and useful for the understanding of domain formation and evolution , spatial and temporal scaling properties , and related questions ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , as well as aging phenomena  ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    given the fixed lattice type and dynamics under consideration , the convergence of @xmath0 can depend only on dimension @xmath11 and on the starting spin configuration @xmath1 .",
    "( other lattice types were considered in  @xcite . )",
    "rigorous results exist for symmetric @xmath1 ( i.e. , for all @xmath15 , @xmath16 with equal probability , independently of all other spins , corresponding to a quench from infinite to zero temperature in zero external field ) in @xmath17 ; here every spin flips infinitely often  @xcite . numerical studies by stauffer  @xcite indicate that this result may hold up to @xmath18 , beyond which @xmath0 could have a limit .",
    "there are few numerical studies  @xcite of the long - time behavior of @xmath0 _ asymmetric _ @xmath1 ( corresponding to a deep quench in nonzero external field ) in dimensions greater than one .",
    "in this paper we present the results of numerical studies that examine the question of convergence of @xmath0 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 with both symmetric and asymmetric initial conditions .",
    "it is known that the magnetization per spin at zero temperature @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an @xmath23 cube centered at the origin , is independent of time in one dimension for any initial magnetization  @xcite .",
    "this time - invariance of the magnetization under glauber dynamics at zero temperature does not hold in higher dimensions ; indeed , it is easy to see , using the independence of the spins in @xmath1 , that in @xmath24 at time @xmath25 the sign of @xmath26 is that of the initial magnetization . for @xmath19",
    "our results indicate that the long time behavior of the symmetric case is unstable to small perturbations in the following sense : for any deviation from up - down symmetry in the initial state , @xmath0 flows towards the uniform final state which is magnetized in the direction of the initial asymmetry . while this result is not surprising , it settles the question of whether the nonexistence of @xmath27 could persist for a nonzero range of asymmetry in @xmath1 .",
    "our results for @xmath24 are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : flow ] . for a @xmath24 lattice of finite size",
    ", a non - uniform final state called the frozen stripe state is also possible .",
    "such a configuration occurs when the spins are aligned parallel to the axes and cease to flip thereafter .",
    "[ fig : flow ]    in addition to the frozen stripe state , a finite size @xmath28 lattice can evolve towards a ` partially frozen ' state ( called ` blinker states ' in  @xcite ) when a subset of the spins continue to flip ceaselessly , without any change in energy , while the remainder of the spins do not flip any more .",
    "our results for the symmetric case in @xmath28 agree with those of stauffer  @xcite . for @xmath7 ,",
    "we find , in agreement with  @xcite , frozen stripe states and blinker configurations , to be discussed in the following sections .",
    "we also discuss the question of extrapolation of results on finite size lattices to those of infinite extent .",
    "so far we have defined the problem informally : following a quench from infinite to zero temperature , in zero or nonzero external magnetic field , and subsequently evolving through standard glauber dynamics in zero field , will the spin configuration eventually settle down to a final state , or will it continue to evolve forever ( and if so , in what sense ) ?",
    "we now state the problem more precisely .",
    "the initial spin configuration @xmath1 is chosen from a bernoulli product measure ( denoted @xmath29 ) , with each spin independently having value @xmath4 with probability @xmath3 and @xmath30 with probability @xmath31 .",

    "the symmetric case corresponds to @xmath7 and has @xmath33 ; any other @xmath29 will be called asymmetric .",
    "the ( single - spin - flip ) dynamics will be taken to be continuous time , given by independent rate 1 poisson processes at each @xmath15 corresponding to those times @xmath34 ( which can be thought of as clock rings at @xmath15 ) when a spin flip ( @xmath35 ) is _",
    "considered_. if the resulting change in energy is negative , then the flip occurs with probability 1 , and if positive , with probability 0 .",
    "if there is a `` tie '' , i.e. , the resulting change in energy would be zero , then the flip occurs with probability 1/2 , as determined by a fair coin toss .",
    "we denote by @xmath36 the probability distribution on the realizations @xmath37 of the dynamics .",
    "so there are two sources of randomness , in the dynamics @xmath37 and in the initial spin configuration @xmath1 .",
    "the joint distribution of @xmath37 and @xmath1 will be denoted @xmath38 .",
    "all results to be discussed below are to be understood as occurring with probability one in @xmath38 .",
    "the question posed in the introduction is whether @xmath0 has a limit , with @xmath38-probability one , as @xmath39 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath40 flipping only finitely many times for every @xmath15 . using the same nomenclature as in  @xcite , we call such an @xmath15 an @xmath41-site ( @xmath41 for finite ) ; if @xmath40 flips infinitely often it is an @xmath42-site ( @xmath42 for infinite ) . by translation - ergodicity , the collection of @xmath41-sites ( resp .",

    "no results were obtained for asymmetric initial conditions .",
    "we note for completeness that the @xmath52 spin glass on @xmath53 with symmetric initial conditions was shown to be type @xmath46  @xcite ; the proof is far more involved than those for the homogeneous cases .",
    "these are models in which couplings are chosen _ a priori _ from a symmetric bernoulli distribution , with values @xmath4 or @xmath30 , and are thereafter quenched .",
    "( in fact a much wider class of related models was also shown to be type-@xmath46 , but these are less relevant to the models studied here . )    under periodic boundary conditions , convergence to a final @xmath4 or @xmath30 state is not guaranteed : the lattice can form _",

    "parallel to the lattice axes .",

    "a simple example of a domain wall in a  @xmath55 lattice is shown below :    [ cols= \" < , < ,",

    "moreover their study indicates that these frozen states persist with positive probability as @xmath59 . when @xmath60 , persistent configurations other than the striped or uniform state are also observed . in these",
    ", the system wanders through a series of iso - energy partially frozen states .",
    "these metastable states are called _ blinkers _ in  @xcite and consist of localized sets of spins that flip forever with zero energy cost , surrounded by frozen spins .",

    "our simulations in @xmath28 also uncovered blinker states .",
    "when such a state appeared , the ` unfrozen ' spins ( i.e. those that continued to flip ) were tracked .    from the simulation data for the @xmath24 lattice , we observe that the number of spin flips is symmetric about a maximum at @xmath64 irrespective of the lattice size .",
    "we also observe that the slope of this curve is sharpest near @xmath64 , while it remains relatively constant for very small or large values of @xmath3 .",

    "compared to the @xmath24 case , there is a smaller fraction of the spins converging to the final uniform state in the @xmath28 case ( @xmath121 ) and this probability only decreases as @xmath5 increases .",
    "also when @xmath116 in the @xmath28 lattice , configurations that have not converged to the uniform @xmath4 or @xmath30 configurations tend to be closer to one of those two states than in the @xmath24 lattice ( cf .",

    "two conclusions can be drawn from these data : first , at the lattice sizes studied the density of blinker spins is quite small ; and second , there is a qualitative difference between the symmetric and asymmetric cases . in particular , when @xmath64 the blinker density _ may _ be increasing with lattice size @xmath5 , while it appears to remain flat for asymmetric initial conditions .",

    "this may suggest that the @xmath59 limit , which distinguishes between striped and uniform states in a clear limiting sense , differs from the @xmath127 case .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the infinite square , at almost every sufficiently large time , any large region will _ locally _ resemble one of the two uniform phases or a domain wall phase .",
    "but this same region will continually approximate each of these three possible states infinitely often , separated ( probably ) by increasingly larger time intervals . on the infinite lattice , this state of affairs results from an unending supply of domain walls coming into any fixed region ` from infinity '  a state of affairs that can not occur for a finite lattice , no matter how large . these results and considerations",
