    "at present , the study of stellar pulsations constitutes one of the most fundamental pillars on which the building of stellar astrophysics rests on . although the theory of stellar pulsations was initially elaborated to explain the existence of classical variable stars such as cepheids and rr lyrae , in the last few decades the study of pulsating stars has been extended to many other different kinds of stars that were regarded as constant stars before ( e.g. , unno et al .",
    "1989 ; gautschy & saio 1995 ) . nowadays ,",
    "new classes of pulsating stars across the hr diagram are being routinely uncovered from ground - based observations as well as space missions ( e.g. , corot , most ; see aerts et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the study of stellar pulsations through the approach of asteroseismology constitutes a powerful tool to probe the internal structure and evolution of stars .",
    "most of the pulsations exhibited by pulsating stars are self - excited through the classical @xmath3-mechanism operating in a partial ionization zone near the surface of stars ( cox 1980 ; unno et al .",
    "1989 ) . as a matter of fact , this mechanism is responsible for pulsations of the stars in the classical instability strip due to partial ionization of h and hei and/or heii . in the driving zone ,",
    "the opacity perturbation increases outward so that radiative luminosity is blocked in the compression phase of pulsation .",
    "the region gains thermal energy in the compression phase and it loses thermal energy in the expansion phase .    a less common and consequently less explored pulsation driving mechanism in stars is the @xmath2-mechanism .",
    "this mechanism is due to vibrational instability induced by thermonuclear reactions . in this case",
    ", the driving is due to the strong dependence of nuclear burning on temperature . during maximum compression , the temperature and",
    "thus the nuclear energy production rates are higher than at equilibrium .",
    "so , in the layers where nuclear reactions take place , thermal energy is gained at compression while the opposite happens during the expansion phase ( unno et al .",
    "1989 ; gautschy & saio 1995 ) . an excellent historical account of studies on vibrational destabilization of stars by the @xmath2-mechanism , can be found in kawaler ( 1988 ) we refer the interested reader to that paper for details .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the @xmath2-mechanism in connection with pulsating pg1159 stars .",
    "these stars , also called gw vir or dov , are very hot h - deficient post - asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars with surface layers rich in he , c and o ( werner & herwig 2006 ) that exhibit multiperiodic luminosity variations with periods ranging from 300 to 6000 s , attributable to non - radial @xmath1-modes driven by the @xmath3-mechanism acting on the region of partial ionization of c and o ( starrfield et al . 1983 , 1984 , 1985 ; gautschy 1997 ; quirion et al .",

    "; quirion et al . 2007 ) .",
    "some pulsating pg1159 stars are still embedded in a nebula and are called planetary nebula nuclei variable ( pnnv ) stars ( see winget & kepler 2008 and fontaine & brassard 2008 for recent reviews ) .",
    "evolutionary models of pg1159 stars with thick he - rich envelopes located at the upper left portion of the hr diagram are characterized by the presence of vigorous he - burning shells .",
    "the first attempt to study the effect of the @xmath2-mechanism induced by a he - burning shell in h - deficient pre - white dwarf stars was the seminal work by kawaler et al .",
    "these authors found some @xmath1-modes excited through this mechanism with periods in the range 70 to 200 s. observationally , however , no signature of these short pulsation periods was found in the surveys of planetary nebula nuclei conducted at that time ( grauer et al . 1987 ; hine & nather 1987 ) .",
    "later on , stability analysis on simplified pg1159 models by saio ( 1996 ) and gautschy ( 1997 ) also predicted unstable @xmath1-modes driven by the @xmath2-mechanism with periods in the range @xmath5 s.    the interest in the @xmath2-mechanism in the context of h - deficient post - agb stars has recently been renewed by the discovery of luminosity variations in the pnnv star   ( @xmath6 k , @xmath7 , c / he= 1.5 and o / he= 0.4 ; werner & herwig 2006 ) by gonzlez prez et al . ( 2006 ) .",
    "the most outstanding feature of   is that its period spectrum appears to include a series of unusually short pulsation periods ( @xmath8 s ) , the shortest periods ever detected in a pulsator of its class .",
    "gonzlez prez et al . ( 2006 ) ( see also solheim et al .",
    "2008 ) speculate that these rapid oscillations could be excited by the @xmath2-mechanism .    in this work",

    "in particular , we gather strong evidence for the existence of a new short - period @xmath1-mode instability strip of pulsating pg1159 stars due to the @xmath2-mechanism . in addition",

    "all of the post - agb evolutionary sequences , computed with lpcode ( althaus et al . 2005 ) , were followed through the very late thermal pulse ( vltp ) and the resulting born - again episode that gives rise to the h - deficient , he- , c- , and o - rich composition characteristic of pg1159 stars . for details about the input physics and evolutionary code used , and the numerical simulations performed to obtain the pg1159 evolutionary sequences employed here , we refer the interested reader to the works mentioned above",
    ". one distinctive feature , and crucial for this study , that is common to all of our sequences , is that the pg1159 models are characterized by he - rich envelopes thick enough as to sustain active he - burning shell sources during the evolutionary stages of interest .",
    "this is at variance with the non - standard pg1159 models employed in althaus et al .",

    "the `` frozen - in convection '' approximation was assumed because the flux of heat carried by convection is negligible in pg1159 stars . at variance with crsico et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , in this work we have fully taken into account the @xmath2-mechanism for mode driving operating in the he - shell nuclear - burning region . because we are interested in pg1159 stars which are h - deficient , we are only concerned with the he - burning reactions . fortunately , because @xmath1-mode pulsation timescales are much shorter than the timescales of nucleosynthesis , possible phase delays between the temperature perturbations and the abundance variations are unimportant . hence , they can be neglected , largely simplifying the pulsational stability analysis ( unno et al . 1989 ; kawaler et al .",
    "1986 ) ) which give rise to some h burning .",

    "is appropriately scaled ( see gautschy 1997 ) .",
    "the sign function allows to discriminate between stable and unstable modes .",
    "the presence of two well - defined families of overstable @xmath1-modes , one at the intermediate- and long - period regime , and the other one at the short period regime , is apparent .",
    "the first group of periods ( @xmath33 s ) corresponds to modes driven by the well - known @xmath3-mechanism operating at the region of the opacity bump due to partial ionization of c and o , centered at @xmath34 ( gautschy et al .",
    "2005 , crsico et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the second group of periods , which are associated to low radial order @xmath1-modes , are destabilized by the action of the vigorous he - shell burning through the @xmath2-mechanism .",
    "the short - period instabilities uncovered here are of the same nature than those found by kawaler et al .",
    "( 1986 ) in the context of h - deficient hot central stars of planetary nebulae . here ,",
    "as in that work , the @xmath2-mechanism induced by the he - shell burning constitutes the source of driving . in absence of this destabilizing agent ,",
    "the overstable modes with periods in the range ( @xmath35 s ) turn out to be stable , while the remainder modes of the pulsation spectrum remains unchanged .",
    "this is vividly displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] , that shows with plus symbols the results of additional stability computations in which the nuclear energy production rate , @xmath2 , and the logarithmic derivatives @xmath36 and @xmath37 , are forced to be zero in the pulsation equations .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that in the present effort we are able to obtain destabilization of @xmath1-modes through both the @xmath3-mechanism _ and _ the @xmath2-mechanism in the same pg1159 equilibrium model .",
    "this is at variance with the study by kawaler et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , who reported only @xmath2-destabilized modes .",
    "the @xmath2-mechanism behaves as an efficient filter of modes that destabilizes only those @xmath1-modes that have their largest maximum of the temperature perturbation ( @xmath38 ) in the narrow region of the he - burning shell ( see kawaler et al .",
    "1986 ) . in the specific case of our template model , only the @xmath1-modes with @xmath39 , and @xmath40",
    "meet such a condition and , as a result , they are @xmath2-destabilized .",
    "for @xmath41 the largest maximum of @xmath38 lies at inner layers with respect to the he - burning shell .",
    "thus , these modes are stable . for modes with @xmath42",
    "the opposite is true and these modes also are stable .    test stability calculations with @xmath43 for our template model indicate that there exist only one quadrupole @xmath2-destabilized @xmath1-mode which corresponds to @xmath44 with a period @xmath45 s , about @xmath46 shorter than the corresponding @xmath47 mode with @xmath48 ( @xmath49 s ) . hence ,",
    "in general , a narrower range of shorter periods is expected to be associated with @xmath2-destabilized @xmath1-modes with @xmath50 as compared with the case of @xmath27 .",
    "having described our results for a single template model , we now are in conditions to examine the location and extension of the complete unstable domain associated with the @xmath2-mechanism .",
    "our results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] , which displays the instability strip of @xmath2-destabilized modes in the @xmath51 drawn with thick black curves along the pg1159 evolutionary tracks .",
    "in addition , the gw vir instability domain of @xmath3-destabilized modes ( see crsico et al .",
    "2006 ) is depicted with red ( gray ) lines along the tracks .",
    "note that the instability strip for @xmath2-destabilized modes partially overlaps the domain of @xmath3-destabilized modes .",
    "so , our results indicate the existence of three well - defined instability regimes in the @xmath52 plane : a regime splitted into two regions , one at low gravity and the other at high gravity in which stellar models harbour intermediate / long period @xmath1-modes excited by the @xmath3-mechanism only , another one corresponding to short - period modes destabilized by the @xmath2-mechanism only , and finally a region in which models experience pulsational destabilization by the @xmath3-mechanism and the @xmath2-mechanism of driving simultaneously .",
    "notably , the region corresponding to the @xmath2-mechanism only is not occupied by any known pg1159 star ( see fig . [ fig03 ] ) .",
    "we stress that in previous works ( kawaler et al .",
    "1986 ; saio 1996 ; gautschy 1997 ) only _ some _ short - period @xmath1-modes were found to be destabilized by the @xmath2-mechanism .",
    "needles to say , due to the very few @xmath2-destabilized modes found in those exploratory works , no clear extension and location of the @xmath2-mechanism instability domain were obtained , thus hampering those authors from making further consideration of such modes . at variance with those works , in the present study we are able to find a _",
    "complete _ instability strip of @xmath2-destabilized modes .",
    "the degree of driving , and the place that it might occur in the @xmath53 diagram , is sensitive to the stellar mass , previous evolutionary history , and so on .",
    "thus , due to the uncertainties in the stellar evolution modelling ( overshooting , nuclear reaction rates , etc ) , the surface and internal composition of pg1159 stars are not known in detail , and so a clear instability domain for @xmath2-destabilized pulsations is difficult to drawn .",
    "so , what is shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] is the shape and location of the @xmath2-mechanism instability strip obtained by us under the particular assumptions adopted in the construction of the pg1159 evolutionary models of miller bertolami & althaus ( 2006 ) .",
    "the extension and location of this instability domain might change if other assumptions for the evolutionary history of the progenitor stars were adopted .    , but including the loci of models having @xmath27 ( dipole ) @xmath3-destabilized modes with solid red ( gray ) curves along the tracks , and models harbouring short - period @xmath2-destabilized modes according to the present study .",
    "superposition of both types of curves corresponds to stellar models with both @xmath2- and @xmath3-destabilized modes ( shaded area ) .",
    "the location and designation of relevant pg1159 stars is also shown [ color figure only available in the electronic version of the article ] . ]    all of the overstable @xmath2-destabilized modes computed in this work are characterized by very tiny ( @xmath54 ) linear growth rates @xmath11 , by far smaller than those characterizing overstable modes excited by the @xmath3-mechanism ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "so , the question rises about what would be the chance for a given @xmath2-destabilized mode to have plenty of time for developing observable amplitudes . to analyze this question",
    "we consider the time interval that the models spend crossing the instability strip of @xmath2-destabilized modes , @xmath56 , and the maximum and minimum @xmath57-folding times @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively , of the unstable modes for a given stellar mass .",
    "the @xmath57-folding times are defined as @xmath60 , such that the time dependence of the amplitude of the pulsations is given by @xmath61 , and @xmath62 for overstable modes .",
    "the values of @xmath56 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 are provided in table [ table1 ] for each value of the stellar mass .",
    "note that the three timescales monotonically decrease for increasing stellar mass .",
    "for all of our pg1159 sequences we found that the most unstable modes those with the smaller values of @xmath65 are found near the low - gravity ( high - luminosity ) boundary of the instability domain ( upper black dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ) , when the models are still evolving to the blue before reaching the evolutionary knee . on the contrary ,",
    "when models are already evolving toward the white dwarf cooling track , the @xmath2-destabilized modes are only marginally unstable , and so they are characterized by large @xmath57-folding times .",
    "table [ table1 ] shows that @xmath66 for all of our sequences .",
    "this means that @xmath1-modes that are destabilized at epochs before the evolutionary knee , characterized by short @xmath57-folding times , have time enough to reach observable amplitudes before the star leaves the instability strip . on the other hand ,",
    "it is apparent that @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the @xmath1-modes that are destabilized in models close to the high - gravity limit ( low - luminosity ) of the instability strip ( lower black dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ) have little or even null chances to develop observable amplitude before the model abandons the instability domain .    in summary ,",
    "our computations predict that some @xmath1-modes ( those with short @xmath65 ) could have plenty of time to grow and finally develop observable amplitudes .",
    "we caution , however , that this prediction is based on a _ linear _ stability analysis , and that the last word should came from a detailed non - linear description of nonadiabatic pulsations .",
    "such a nonlinear treatment is not available at the present stage .",
    "also , there are other effects ( stellar winds , diffusion , etc ) suspected to be present in real stars , that could be affecting the growth of pulsations .",
    "the assessment of their effects on the modes predicted to be unstable in the frame of our analysis is beyond the scope of the present study .",

    "( 2006 ) for   with their corresponding uncertainties in @xmath70 are displayed with small circles .",
    "periods detected with sufficiently high significance are emphasized with black filled circles . ]",
    "another consequence of our investigation concerns the pulsating star pg 1159@xmath71035 , the prototype of the class and the best - studied dov .",
    "indeed , note from fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] that a trend of our results is that this variable star should exhibit short - period @xmath2-destabilized modes if the thick he - rich envelopes derived from our evolutionary calculations were representative of the star .",
    "these modes are not observed by costa et al .",
    "this result suggests that the he - burning shell may not be active in .",
    "this would indicate that this star has a thinner he - rich envelope than what is traditionally derived from standard evolutionary calculations , in line with the recent finding by althaus et al .",
    "( 2008 ) that a thinner he - rich envelope ( at least a factor of two below of the value predicted by the standard evolution theory ) for pg 1159@xmath71035 should be invoked to alleviate the longstanding discrepancy between the observed ( costa & kepler 2008 ) and the theoretical ( crsico et al .",
    "2008 ) rates of period change in that star .",
    "if the short periods observed in  were confirmed , then we should face the problem of the coexistence of two pg1159 stars located very close each other in the @xmath72 diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ) but with substantially different thickness of the he - rich envelopes",
    ". this would suggest that these stars could have had a different evolutionary history , a suggestion reinforced by the fact that  still retains a planetary nebula while pg 1159@xmath71035 does not .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a fully nonadiabatic stability analysis on state - of - the - art pg1159 models generated taking into account the complete evolution of progenitor stars , through the thermally pulsing agb phase and born - again episode .",
    "we have explored the possibility that nonradial @xmath1-mode pulsations could be destabilized by a he - burning shell through the @xmath2-mechanism .",
    "our study covers a broad range of stellar masses and effective temperatures .",

    "the main results are the following :    * we found strong theoretical evidence for the existence of a separate , well - defined pg1159 instability strip in the @xmath0 diagram characterized by short - period @xmath1-modes excited by the @xmath2-mechanism due to the presence of active he - burning shells .",
    "notably , this instability strip partially overlaps the already known gw vir instability strip due to the @xmath3-mechanism acting on the partial ionization of c and/or o in the envelope of the pg1159 stars .",

    "we speculate that the absence of short periods ( @xmath79 s ) in the pulsation spectrum of pg 1159@xmath71035 could be indicating that the he - burning shell may not be active in this star .",
    "this would indicate that pg 1159@xmath71035 has a thinner he - rich envelope than what is traditionally derived from standard evolutionary computations .    in light of our results , if the reality of the short periods of were confirmed by follow - up observations , this star could be the first known pulsating pg1159 star undergoing nonradial @xmath1-modes destabilized by the @xmath2-mechanism .",
    "even more ,   could be the first known pulsating star in which both the @xmath3-mechanism and the @xmath2-mechanism of mode driving are _ simultaneously _ operating .",
    "further time - series photometry of  will be needed to firmly establish the reality of the short - period pulsations detected in this star .",
    "on the other hand , the apparent absence of short - period pulsations in the remainder variable stars such as k 1@xmath7116 , hs 2324 + 3944 , and jn 1 could be an indication that , like , they are characterized by thin he - rich envelopes , as a result of which they should lack of stable he - shell burning .",
    "another possibility is that short - period pulsations could be indeed present in these stars , but with very low amplitudes , below the actual detection limits .",
    "also , it is quite intriguing the absence of both short- and intermediate / long - period pulsations in the up to now constant stars ( ngc 650@xmath711 , pg 1144 + 005 , abell 21 , longmore 3 , hs 1517 + 7403 , pg 1424 + 535 , iw 1 ) that populate the overlapping region of the @xmath2- and @xmath3-destabilized modes . in any case , extensive searches for low amplitude intrinsic variability in these stars and also in the stars sh 2@xmath7168 and hs 0704 + 6153 , which have not been observed for variability yet , should be worth doing in order to test the existence of the new theoretical instability strip uncovered in this work .",

    "<S> we present a pulsational stability analysis of hot post - agb h - deficient pre - white dwarf stars with active he - burning shells . </S>",
    "<S> the stellar models employed are state - of - the - art equilibrium structures representative of pg1159 stars derived from the complete evolution of the progenitor stars , through the thermally pulsing agb phase and born - again episode . on the basis of fully nonadiabatic pulsation computations , we confirmed theoretical evidence for the existence of a separate pg1159 instability strip in the @xmath0 diagram characterized by short - period @xmath1-modes excited by the @xmath2-mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> this instability strip partially overlaps the already known gw vir instability strip of intermediate / long period @xmath1-modes destabilized by the classical @xmath3-mechanism acting on the partial ionization of c and/or o in the envelope of pg1159 stars . </S>",
    "<S> we found that pg1159 stars characterized by thick he - rich envelopes and located inside this overlapping region could exhibit both short and intermediate / long periods simultaneously .    as a natural application of our results , we study the particular case of , a pulsating planetary nebula nucleus ( pg1159-type ) particularly interesting because it has been reported to exhibit a rich and complex pulsation spectrum including a series of unusually short pulsation periods . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the long periods exhibited by can be readily explained by the classical @xmath3-mechanism , while the observed short - period branch below @xmath4 s could correspond to modes triggered by the he - burning shell through the @xmath2-mechanism , although more observational work is needed to confirm the reality of these short - period modes . </S>",
    "<S> were the existence of short - period @xmath1-modes in this star convincingly confirmed by future observations ,   could be the first known pulsating star in which both the @xmath3-mechanism and the @xmath2-mechanism of mode driving are _ simultaneously _ operating .    </S>"
