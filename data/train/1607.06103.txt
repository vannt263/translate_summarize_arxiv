    "the knowledge of the level density in a quantum many - body system is necessary for the correct understanding of the response of the system to external perturbations .",
    "the nuclear level density is a vitally important element of reaction theory , including astrophysical processes and broad applications of nuclear physics .",
    "but it might also serve as a mirror reflecting special features of intrinsic structure and this will be the main subject of our consideration .    in a fermi - system environment , the level density exponentially grows with energy due to the combinatorics of particle - hole excitations from the defrosted fermi surface .",
    "this occurs even in the simplest picture of a fermi gas without residual interaction @xcite .",
    "the fermi gas model does not however account for the effects on the level density due to the shell structure , pairing correlations @xcite or coherent excitations of collective nature @xcite .",
    "various semi - phenomenological approaches have been developed which account for such effects @xcite considered as additions to the skeleton of the fermi - gas , or of a more elaborate self - consistent mean field with pairing .",
    "low - lying collective modes , mainly of isoscalar nature , lead to the reconfiguration of the nuclear spectra . in an even - even non - magic",
    "nucleus , pairing correlations create an energy gap in the excitation spectrum . inside",
    "the gap vibrational collective modes start the sequence of phonon states which gradually mix with unpaired particles appearing above the pair breaking threshold .",
    "away from the magic nuclei , the accumulating valence particle frequently lead to broken internal symmetry and static deformation of the core .",
    "then nuclear rotation appears as a new branch of the excitation spectrum .",
    "the rotational bands , with a small distortion of the nuclear field along the band , appear at low energy .",
    "all these effects should noticeably change the low - lying nuclear level density @xcite .    in the framework of the shell model , pairing and collective effects",
    "are fully taken into account through the two - body interaction matrix elements .",
    "since the shell model is formulated in a truncated orbital space and therefore has the fixed total number of quantum states , the collective enhancement can appear as enrichment of the level density at the low - energy part of the spectrum , accompanied by a corresponding suppression of the level density at higher excitation energy .",
    "the shell - model experience shows that the effects of deformation and related rotational motion appear naturally for a sufficiently rich space and appropriate set of two - body interaction matrix elements as a result of the diagonalization in a spherical basis .",
    "this is an important advantage of the shell - model approach since one does not need to take special care of the strict fulfillment of conservation laws ( particle number , angular momentum , parity and isospin ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the computational problems impose the limitation on the total dimension of the orbital space .",
    "the _ moments method _ based on statistical properties of large hamiltonian matrices @xcite was recently formulated @xcite as a practical tool for calculating the level density for a given hamiltonian avoiding the diagonalization of large matrices .",
    "it was shown how the first two moments of the hamiltonian define the full level density that coincides with the result of the exact diagonalization if the latter is feasible . some latest results and first comparisons with the phenomenology , thermodynamics , and mean",
    "field combinatorics can be found in @xcite .",
    "one important conclusion is that in realistic cases the level density in a finite hilbert space is a smooth bell - shape curve .",
    "the contributions of individual shells , which are clearly pronounced in the mean - field combinatorics , are smeared by the multitude of incoherent collision - like interactions which are always present in realistic hamiltonians in addition to the collective parts like pairing and multipole forces . in this article ,",
    "our problem is rather different .",
    "we are going to explore the landscape of nuclear hamiltonians varying the parameters in order to establish the existence and dynamic sources of the collective enhancement of the level density .",
    "we use the moments method to extract the cases with collective behavior and study the corresponding level densities .",
    "this method was used earlier @xcite for understanding the predominance of prolate deformation among non - spherical nuclei . with the variation of parameters of the shell - model hamitonian",
    ", we are able to localize and study the phase transitions between spherical and deformed shapes .    in section 2 we give a brief description of the moments method , in section 3 we describe the division of the full shell - model hamiltonian into different subsets of matrix elements which can be varied independently .",
    "section 4 presents the effects of those subsets on the low - lying spectrum of different nuclear systems and on the level densities . in section 5",
    "we discuss a quantum phase transition between spherical and deformed shapes by varying the strength of the matrix elements .",
    "the concluding discussion is given in section 6 .",
    "here we very briefly remind the formalism of the moments method .",
    "we use the shell - model hamiltonian @xmath2 that contains the mean field and residual two - body effective interactions .",
    "the level density is found as a superposition of modified ( finite range ) gaussians , @xmath3 here @xmath4 stands for the exact quantum numbers of spin and parity , while @xmath5 runs over partitions ( distributions of particles among available single - particle orbitals ) ; @xmath6 is the dimension of a given partition , and @xmath7 is the finite - range gaussian determined by the ground state energy , the centroid ( the first moment of the hamiltonian ) and the width ( the second moment ) .",
    "the second moment includes all interactions mixing the partitions .",
    "both moments can be computed directly by the hamiltonian matrix avoiding its diagonalization .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the result ( [ 1 ] ) is , in all studied cases , in good agreement with the product of the full diagonalization if the latter is practically possible .",
    "technical details related to finding the ground state energy , @xmath8-scheme against @xmath9-scheme , fit of the spin cut - off parameter , removal of unphysical center - of - mass excitations in the cases of cross - shell transitions etc . are discussed in previous publications @xcite .",
    "in the simplest ( but still rich in physics and numerous applications ) case of the @xmath0 shell model we have only three single - particle levels , @xmath10 .",
    "the angular momentum and isospin conservation allow 63 matrix elements of the residual two - body interactions .",
    "keeping intact all symmetry requirements , we can vary numerical values of the two - body matrix elements of the effective interaction . as a result , we come to different versions of the shell model which can cover the whole spectral variety allowed by the given hilbert space . in this way we can select the parts of the interaction responsible for specific observable physical phenomena .    in a recent study @xcite , where in the same spirit the @xmath1 orbital space was used , it was found that certain interaction matrix elements are responsible for the transition from a spherical shape to a deformed one .",
    "first of all , they were the matrix elements ( @xmath1 matrix elements in that specific model ) changing the occupation numbers of the subshells by one unit , i.e. the matrix elements @xmath11 with @xmath12 , or @xmath13 , or @xmath14 , or @xmath15 .",
    "this drives the mixing of spherical orbitals in the process of deformation",
    ". a complementary version of a similar approach was applied in @xcite in order to demonstrate that the incoherent parts of the residual interaction are essential for producing chaotic wave functions and resulting smooth level density .",
    "borrowing this approach we divide the set of interaction matrix elements into two parts . the part @xmath16 includes the  particle - hole \" matrix elements which change the occupation number of the subshells by one unit with the change of orbital momentum @xmath17 , whereas the part @xmath18 includes the remaining matrix elements , which either do nt change the occupation number of the subshells ( @xmath12 and @xmath15 ) , or change it by two units ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 here the part @xmath22 contains the single - particle energies . from this point on we will be calling the matrix elements of the @xmath16 part ,  one unit change \" matrix elements . the numerical parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 allow us to explore regions of the hilbert space where the nuclear structure undergoes significant changes .",
    "the original shell - model case emerges for @xmath25 . probing various combinations of parameters @xmath23 and",
    "@xmath24 one can see how these two parts affect the level density and other observable quantities of interest",
    ". we will study the evolution of the level density as a function of these particular interaction modes paying special attention to the low - lying parts of the spectrum as indicators of characteristic underlying structures . in even - even nuclei",
    "we characterize the low - lying spectrum by the levels ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) , quadrupole transitions between them , and shape multipoles , as well as by the resulting level density .",
    "this section presents a quantitative study of how the @xmath29 and @xmath30 parts of the shell - model hamiltonian ( [ 2 ] ) change the collective observables .",
    "we find whether these interactions are capable of producing typical deformed or spherical characteristics of the nuclear field in the low - energy part of the nuclear spectrum .",
    "two shell model spaces , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 , have been studied . as already mentioned , the interaction of the @xmath0 shell - model space has 63 non - zero matrix elements , among which 22 elements induce one - body transitions between the partitions ( these are included in the @xmath29 part of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , while the remaining 41 matrix elements ( those included in the part @xmath30 of eq . ( [ 2 ] ) either couple states within the same partition or transfer two particles between partitions , including usual pairing .    in the same spirit",
    ", the interaction in the @xmath1 shell has 195 non - zero matrix elements , 79 of which are included in the @xmath29 part of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , while 116 remaining matrix elements , which either do nt change the occupation number of the subshells or induce two - body transitions between the partitions , make up the @xmath30 part of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "we have considered the cases with four valence protons + four valence neutrons and six valence protons + six valence neutrons for the @xmath0 shell ( these correspond to the @xmath31 mg and @xmath32si nuclei , respectively ) and the case of six valence protons + six valence neutrons for the @xmath1 shell model ( the @xmath33fe nucleus ) .",
    "the observables used for studying the effects of various parts of the interaction are the low - lying @xmath34 and @xmath35 energy levels , the ratio of these energies , @xmath36=@xmath37 ) , the expectation value of the quadrupole moment in the first excited state , @xmath38 ) and the reduced quadrupole transition probability , @xmath39(e2;@xmath40 ) . in order to distinguish between spherical and deformed cases , we use as an indicator the ratio @xmath36 , which should be close to 2 for spherical shapes and close to 3.3 for deformed shapes . selected results of the exact shell - model analysis are shown in tables i and ii .",

    "in this study , the fixed hilbert space of the shell model has been probed by varying the numerical parameters of the hamiltonian while keeping intact all exact conservation laws .",
    "this allows us to study the evolution of physical observables and the corresponding level density .",
    "technically the shell - model hamiltonian was divided in two parts .",
    "the part @xmath29 included the two - body matrix elements which induce the transfer of one nucleon between the partitions , whereas the part @xmath30 contained remaining matrix elements . by varying the strength of the two parts of the hamiltonian",
    ", we have followed the changes of the energy spectrum , quadrupole moments and transition probabilities for selected nuclei in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 shells .",
    "the results confirm that the  one unit change \" matrix elements are responsible for the appearance of rotational characteristics , lowering energy of the @xmath34 and @xmath35 levels , inducing the @xmath36 values typical for a rotor and large reduced transition probabilities between rotational states . on the other hand , the @xmath30 part of the interaction breaks the rotational characteristics and induces a vibrational behavior .",
    "collective modes in nuclei strongly influence the level density at the low - energy part of the spectrum , the phenomenologically known effect called the _ collective enhancement_. by selecting the rotational and vibrational cases resulting from the variation of the shell model hamiltonian , one can clearly see that the deformed nuclear spectra are richer in low - lying levels compared to the spherical ones , a clear indication of collective enhancement .",
    "the enhancement has to be compensated at higher energy unless we extend our orbital space ; for the fixed space , the compensation occurs beyond the borderline of applicability of the used shell - model version .    the role of the  one unit change \" matrix elements as the carriers of deformation is so pronounced that one can even see a quantum phase transition between deformed and spherical ( often with soft vibrations as predecessors of the shape instability ) phases of the system , by simultaneously varying the @xmath29 and @xmath30 parts of the hamiltonian .",
    "the phase transition reveals itself in the ground state wave function of the system , the energy spectrum and transition probabilities .",
    "no similar phase transition has been observed by dividing the hamiltonian in other combinations .",
    "the phase transition reveals itself by the cooperative dynamical action of many components of the interaction present in the shell - model hamiltonian .",
    "our preliminary results have shown that in the case in odd - odd nuclei the  one unit change \" matrix elements affect noticeably the whole energy spectrum . for odd - odd nuclei we would expect to see signs of collective enhancement even at the transitional point .",
