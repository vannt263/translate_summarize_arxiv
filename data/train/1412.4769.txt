    "an electron ion collider ( eic ) is being considered as the next generation qcd facility to understand how the visible universe is built up  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the eic will probe with unprecedented precision the low bjorken - x domain where gluons and sea quarks dominate for both nucleons and nuclei .",
    "a possible realization of the accelerator facility based on the ( currently operating ) relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , called erhic , has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "the solenoidal tracker at rhic ( star ) detector , one of the two major experiments at rhic , has been planned to evolve into estar with a suite of upgrades optimized for the eic physics program . the estar detector performance and a broad range of flagship measurements , which have been identified as part of the eic science case , have been studied through simulation .",
    "estar has been found to be well suitable for an initial stage of erhic  @xcite .",
    "however , one of the major experimental challenges is to cleanly identify the scattered electron and to provide precise kinematics of the interaction .",
    "we have proposed a compact transition radiation detector ( trd ) followed by an endcap time - of - flight ( etof ) detector with an additional converter  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ trd_setup ] illustrates a schematic view of the detector configuration relevant to this proposal .",
    "the low - material time projection chamber ( tpc ) ( and a possible inner tracker ) in a solenoidal field in front of trd , provides tracking , momentum , and photon rejection .",
    "the combination of etof and tpc provides electron identification at electron momentum less than a few gev/@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , etof provides hadron identification in the case that both hadrons and the scattered electrons strike the etof , as well as the collision time reference .",
    "the proposed trd is similar to the alice trd  @xcite , providing measurement in addition to the transition radiation ( tr ) signal and tracklet reconstruction capability , but with a readout stage based on thick gas electron multiplier ( thgem ) chamber rather than the multiple wire proportional chamber ( mwpc ) .",
    "the operation principle and design of the thgem based trd chamber is depicted by fig .",
    "[ trd_working_principle ] .",
    "the trd serves two functions .",
    "firstly , it provides additional measurement with a xe rich gas mixture at the entire momentum range .",
    "this is essential for small angle scattering , where only a small section of the particle trajectory falls within the tracking detector acceptance , resulting in few hits in the tracking detector and worse resolution ( 1/@xmath6 rule ) . through the simulation  @xcite ,",
    "trd with 300 @xmath4 m spatial resolution is enough for tracking due to the thick trd radiator and material in the tpc endcap .",
    "secondly , it adds necessary tr signal to particles at high momentum .",
    "the tr threshold is around @xmath7  @xmath8  1000@xmath32000 . from a practical standpoint ,",
    "only electrons provide such radiation into the ionization chamber in the trd , boosting the effective electron to even higher values from the existing relativistic rise .            comparing with the gas electron multiplier ( gem ) chamber first introduced in 1996 at cern  @xcite ,",
    "the thgem chamber is one of the most recently developed micropattern gas detectors  @xcite .",
    "the thgem is a robust , high - gain gaseous electron multiplier , and has a hole - structure similar to the gem  @xcite .",
    "it is manufactured economically by mechanically drilling sub - millimeter diameter holes in a thin printed - circuit board ( pcb ) , followed by cu - etching of the hole s rim .    due to lack of xe in laboratory , we used the ar mixture instead of xe mixture as the working gas of the thgem chamber .",
    "some experiments were carried out for comparing the thgem or gem chamber performance in large variety of gases  @xcite .",
    "the maximum gain measured with thgem chamber operating in xe is similar to that measured with thgem chamber operating in ar at atmospheric pressure  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the maximum gem chamber gains measured in ar / co@xmath9 and xe / co@xmath10 are comparable at atmospheric pressure  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the results in  @xcite show the best energy resolution of the specified thgem chamber reached in ar with 5.9 kev x - rays is 30@xmath2 fwhm while that reached in xe is 27@xmath2 fwhm .",
    "these previous experiment results illustrate the results measured with the thgem chamber operating in ar mixture are able to provide a valid reference for that operating in xe mixture .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on thgem chamber s performance in various aspects such as detection efficiency , spatial resolution , gain uniformity and stability , especially the track reconstruction capability .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the thgem chamber .",
    "the cosmic ray test system setup is presented in section 3 .",
    "section 4 describes the performance of the thgem chamber .",
    "section 5 provides a concluding summary .",
    "the thgem chamber in this study uses three thgem foils in cascade .",
    "these foils are provided by the institute of high energy physics ( ihep ) , china . the foil structure",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ foil_structure ] .",
    "the major parameters include foil thickness 300 @xmath4 m , hole diameter 150 @xmath4 m , and hole pitch 400 @xmath4 m .",
    "the rim clearance region around the hole is @xmath350 @xmath4 m .",
    "the effective readout area given by the foil is 10@xmath010 @xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ readout_structure ] depicts the readout board structure of the thgem chamber .",
    "the readout unit , with a pitch of 800 @xmath4 m , is strip - style in @xmath11 direction while pad - style ( inter - connected beneath ) in @xmath12 direction .",
    "the thickness of the thgem chamber ionization gap is 11.3 mm .",

    "the regular gem chamber along @xmath13 direction is 10.5 cm.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "two different setups of the cosmic ray test system are shown in fig .",
    "[ cosmic_system_setup ] .",
    "three scintillators read out by photomultipliers , providing trigger for this system , are placed upstream and downstream of the three gem chambers .",
    "the effective trigger area is around 12@xmath012 @xmath1 .",
    "the system consists of two regular gem chambers ( gem0 , gem2 ) and one thgem chamber ( gem1 ) in between .",
    "the vertical ( @xmath13 direction ) distance between the thgem chamber and the regular gem chamber is 10.5 cm .",
    "the readout boards of the two regular gem chambers , with 3.8 mm ionization gap width , are identical to that of the thgem chamber .",
    "these two gem chambers are used to calibrate the thgem chamber .",
    "they can also be used to measure the cosmic ray tracklet slope to study the track reconstruction capability of the thgem chamber .",
    "the left setup in fig .",
    "[ cosmic_system_setup ] with all the detectors aligned vertically is used to measure the detection efficiency of the thgem chamber while the right setup with 4.1 cm horizontal offset between the thgem chamber and the regular gem chamber along @xmath12 direction is used to study other performance of the thgem chamber , such as spatial resolution , track reconstruction capability , gain uniformity and stability .",
    "the front end electronics ( fee ) of these three gem chambers are all based on the apv25-s1 chip  @xcite , and the readout system is almost the same as that of the forward gem tracker ( fgt ) at the star experiment  @xcite .",
    "the only difference is that the front end card has only 2 apv chips rather than 5 used for the fgt .",
    "each readout unit is sampled in 27 time bins ( 26.7 ns bin width ) along electron drift direction ( @xmath13 direction ) .",
    "the typical average charge as a function of drift time for the mini - drift thgem chamber at operating voltage measured by this readout system is shown in fig .",
    "[ adcvstb](a ) , and its width is the drift time in the ionization gap . the drift time in the ionization gap can be calculated through the differential spectrum of the average charge vs. drift time , shown in fig .",
    "[ adcvstb](b ) .",
    "thus , the electron drift velocity can be derived and the value is 2.19 cm/@xmath4s ( 1.13/(0.603 - 0.087 ) cm/@xmath4s ) . because we used 3 thgem foils in cascade , the effective drift length should be a little larger than the ionization gap width .",
    "so the drift velocity measured by this method is a little smaller than the real velocity value .",
    "in order to find the optimum operating voltage of the thgem chamber , the detection efficiency is scanned as a function of hv with the cosmic ray test system .",
    "a schematic view of the thgem chamber hv divider is shown in fig .",
    "[ hv_divider ] .",
    "the efficiency plateau of the thgem chamber is shown in fig .",
    "[ eff_plateau ] .",
    "the detection efficiency goes above 90@xmath2 when the applied hv is higher than -3.5 kv .",
    "-3.65 kv is selected as the operating hv for the thgem chamber at which the efficiency is greater than 94@xmath2 .",
    "the two regular gem chambers performance was tested elsewhere before this cosmic ray test .",
    "their spatial resolutions are found to be better than 150 @xmath4 m  @xcite .",
    "the zenith angle ( @xmath14 ) distribution of cosmic ray recorded by this system is shown in fig .",
    "[ thgem_spatial](a ) .",
    "the zenith angle is calculated by the cosmic ray hit positions on the two regular gem chambers using the following expression tan@xmath15 , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the @xmath11 , @xmath12 positions measured by gem0 using the center of gravity method while @xmath18 , @xmath19 are provided by gem2 .",
