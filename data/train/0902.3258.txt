    "observations now indicate that many bulges in nearby disk galaxies are more complicated than previously thought .",
    "bulges were once considered to be essentially elliptical galaxies surrounded by disks ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . yet , contrary to historic assumptions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we now know that bulges are not typically uniformly old , non - star forming systems .",
    "many bulges in the nearby universe are filled with young stars and cold molecular gas @xcite .",
    "the most active bulges have star formation rates as high as 1  m@xmath2  yr@xmath3 @xcite , and exceedingly higher star formation rate densities than their outer disk .",
    "yet it is certainly true that many non - star forming , red bulges exists ; for example the nearest bulge outside our own galaxy , m  31 , is made of mostly old stars .",
    "@xcite shows with mid - ir colors , bulges are either actively forming stars at similar rates to their associated outer disk , or they show a break in mid - ir colors indicating no activity in the bulge ; star formation activity in bulges is bimodal .",
    "@xcite finds that those bulges with active disk - like star - formation have disk - like morphology within the central few hundred parsecs of the bulge .",
    "such differences suggest that the nature of bulge growth in nearby disks galaxies is dichotomous . in this paper",
    "we wish to study the nature of the mass growth in nearby star - forming bulges .",
    "we compare present day star formation rates to stellar masses of bulges to estimate the significance of the star formation rate in nearby active bulges .",
    "we also compare star formation rate density to properties of the bulge and the disk .",
    "in addition to stellar populations and sfr , bulges lack homogeneity in many fundamental properties ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the observations suggest that bulges are bimodal in nature , and furthermore , this division is linked to the well - known bimodality in global galaxy properties @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems that the difference in bulge type is fundamentally connected to the history of the entire galaxy .",
    "the two types of bulges are typically called _ classical bulges _ and _ pseudobulges_. classical bulges have properties similar to elliptical galaxies ; whereas pseudobulges are similar in many ways to disk galaxies .",
    "properties that can identify bulges as pseudobulges include the following : dynamics that are dominated by rotation @xcite , the bulge has a nearly exponential surface brightness profile @xcite , flattening similar to that of their outer disk @xcite , nuclear bar @xcite , nuclear ring , and/or nuclear spiral @xcite .",
    "classical bulges are typically identified as having hot stellar dynamics , more nearly r@xmath4 surface brightness profiles , typically more round than the outer disk @xcite , and a relatively featureless morphology .",
    "also , @xcite show that the structural properties of classical bulges ( absolute magnitude , srsic index , half - light radius , and surface brightness at the half - light radius ) correlate in the same way as elliptical galaxies , yet pseudobulges do not participate in these correlations .",
    "@xcite shows that many bulges fall below the kormendy relation , and are thus lower in surface density per radial size than a similar sized elliptical galaxy .",
    "as stated above , the dichotomy in bulge properties extends to the ism properties of bulges .",
    "@xcite compare the radial distribution of co to the stellar light profiles in 15 spiral galaxies .",
    "they find that most of the galaxies in their sample show an excess of co emission in the bulge region of the galaxy , and further that the central co radial distribution is similar to that of the stellar light .",
    "@xcite shows a similar result with spitzer irac  8  @xmath5 m ( pah ) data .",
    "@xcite find that 45% of the galaxies in the bima song survey have a peak co emission within the central 6 , while many galaxies have a central hole in the co map .",
    "this is similar to the result of @xcite , described above .",
    "thus their appears to be a bimodal distribution of ism properties in nearby bulges .",
    "stellar populations and age - gradients in bulges of disk galaxies suggest multiple formation mechanisms as well .",
    "@xcite show with optical and near - ir colors that many , but not all , bulges are young .",
    "@xcite find that earlier - type , more luminous , and higher surface brightness galaxies are older and more metal - rich , suggesting an early and more rapid star formation history for these galaxies recent work with the sauron survey continues to show such results .",
    "@xcite shows that a large fraction of bulges fall below the mg@xmath6  -  @xmath7 correlation of coma cluster ellipticals , as do all the bulges in sb - sd galaxies in the sample of @xcite .",
    "there is evidence that those bulges in @xcite with central velocity dispersion drops tend to be younger .",
    "however , @xcite find that bulges in their sample follow similar correlations of stellar populations and dynamics as elliptical galaxies .",
    "also , @xcite suggest that only the late - type bulges in their sample could have been significantly affected by slow internal growth . as in ism properties ,",
    "stellar populations seem to come in two separate flavors , some bulges are young and others are old .",
    "many observations indicate that the properties of pseudobulges are linked to those of their associated outer disks . observed connections between bulge and disk stellar populations @xcite , inter - stellar medium @xcite , and scale lengths @xcite suggest that pseudobulges form through processes intimately linked to their host disks .",
    "@xcite show that the connection between the radial sizes of bulges and disks only exists for pseudobulges .",
    "similarly , @xcite shows that only pseudobulges have ism properties and sfr like their outer disks .",
    "these connections between pseudobulge and disk properties motivate some authors to consider the possibility that pseudobulge formation is linked to disk properties .    in summary ,",
    "the observations suggest that pseudobulges are rotating rapidly , actively forming stars , and structurally different than elliptical galaxies .",
    "furthermore , many properties of pseudobulges ( e.g.  radial size , and stellar populations ) are linked to their outer disk . yet ,",
    "classical bulges are dominated by random motions , contain old stars , and are structurally similar to elliptical galaxies ; they re properties thus far appear somewhat independent of the surrounding disk .",
    "in this paper we use data from spitzer space telescope , hubble space telescope , and the galaxy evolution explorer to study the present day growth of bulges in nearby disk galaxies .",
    "we use specific star formation rates to estimate the time - scales for bulge formation . also , we report on connections between star formation rates in bulges and structural properties of those bulges and with properties of their associated outer disks .",
    "to be explicit , in this paper the term `` pseudobulge '' is purely observational .",
    "we classify a bulge as pseudobulge only if the bulge has disk - like morphology , srsic index lower than two , or both of these ( discussed in more detail in  4 ) .",
    "separate from this observational definition , it has been proposed by many authors that pseudobulges could have formed through internal disk evolution .",
    "our aim is to test this hypothesis .",
    "if pseudobulges truly form all of their stellar mass through internal means , the implication would be that galaxies with pseudobulges are physically more similar to a bulgeless galaxy .",
    "how can one observe a bulgeless galaxy with @xmath8 ?",
    "a large number of simulations show that non - axisymetries are able to rearrange disk gas such that the central gas density increases @xcite .",
    "if a hypothetical galaxy initially has a purely exponential stellar mass density profile ( @xmath9 ) , but the gaseous inflow generates a steeper than exponential gas profile , the central star formation rate density will be enhanced accordingly @xcite .",
    "if the central few hundred parsecs of this hypothetical galaxy have a greater sfr per unit mass than the outer parts do , then eventually the stellar density profile will become steeper than an exponential profile .",
    "when one applies typical bulge - disk decomposition machinery that assumes an exponential disk and srsic bulge to observations of the hypothetical galaxy , the result will be @xmath10 this scenario is typically referred to as `` secular '' bulge growth .",
    "observationally the hypothetical galaxy has a bulge , but theoretically speaking its just that this disk galaxy has a stellar density profile that is steeper than an exponential .",
    "given that we can not know for certain what happened to make a particular pseudobulge , we choose a purely observational terminology to label bulges .",
    "in what follows we will not assume _ a priori _ that our classification implies distinct physical nature .",
    "the evidence suggest that a large fraction of disks are barred and those bars are long - lived @xcite .",
    "connections between the presence of bars and bulge growth give credence to the secular bulge growth hypothesis . in simulations ,",
    "barred potentials are efficient mechanisms to drive gaseous inflows @xcite .",
    "observations show that galaxies with bars tend to have higher molecular gas densities than those without @xcite .",
    "as well , @xcite find in a sample of 257 sbc barred and unbarred systems that blue star - forming bulges are predominantly in barred galaxies .",
    "@xcite estimate that the mean rate of inflow of molecular gas in barred galaxies must be 0.1 - 1  m@xmath2 yr@xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , molecular gas densities and dynamics in barred galaxies suggest that active star formation is currently building rapidly rotating bulges @xcite .     of pseudobulges from @xcite in @xmath11-band .",
    "bottom panel : the distribution of @xmath0 of pseudobulges from @xcite , in near - ir .",
    "[ fig : b2 t ] ]    though bulges in barred galaxies on average do have higher sfr , many barred galaxies exist with bulges that are not currently growing .",
    "@xcite shows that the growth is better connected to bulge morphology , finding that pseudobulges are growing , but classical bulges are not .",
    "@xcite find many unbarred galaxies with pseudobulges .",
    "indeed , simulations by @xcite indicate that spiral structure can drive secular evolution in disk galaxies as well . furthermore , spiral structure is certainly a common phenomenon in disk galaxy .",
    "@xcite argue that secular evolution in rotationally supported disks is a natural response to local energy minimization , and thus given the opportunity , disks will innately drive gas inward . bars may be sufficient but not necessary .",
    "thus it makes sense that secular bulge growth is common , and it appears that even mild non - axisymmetries like spiral structure can drive gaseous inflows .",
    "recent studies show that galaxy formation models do not predict enough disk galaxies with low @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite finds that the predicted fraction of high mass spirals with a present - day @xmath12 is a factor of fifteen smaller than the observed fraction of high mass spirals with such small bulges .",
    "similarly @xcite finds in simulations that almost all giant galaxies would have accreted a mass that is larger than the mass of the milky way disk in the past @xmath110  gyr .",
    "given that such an encounter is likely to destroy a disk , these results , `` raise serious concerns about the survival of thin - disk - dominated galaxies within the current paradigm for galaxy formation in a @xmath13cdm universe . ''    if pseudobulges form secularly , then even pseudobulge galaxies with observed b / t@xmath10.3 are still `` bulgeless '' galaxies . in fig .",
    "[ fig : b2 t ] we show the distribution of bulge - to - total light ratios ( b / t ) for pseudobulges ( blue lines ) with @xmath11-band data ( top panel ) from @xcite and near - ir data ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the vertical dashed line represents @xmath14 .",
    "it is certainly true that pseudobulges much more commonly have low bulge - to - total ratios .",
    "however , 33% of the pseudobulges in @xcite and 24% of the pseudobulges with near - ir data have @xmath15 .",
    "pseudobulges with @xmath15 are by no means rare among pseudobulges . if pseudobulges form all their mass secularly , then the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : b2 t ] would imply that the number of bulgeless galaxies is underestimated , and those gaps between observation and theory become more dire .",
    "what else might form pseudobulges ? it is often assumed that bulges formed through successive merging of similar - mass sub - halo objects early on , and remaining gas that was not involved in the merging process settles into a gas disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "something similar to this process may be able to describe the population of classical bulges .",
    "indeed , @xcite find that classical bulges reside exclusively in red sequence galaxies . yet",
    ", it would be difficult for the end products of such processes as roughly equal - mass merging with violent relaxation to make bulges with cold dynamics and disk - like morphologies .",
    "furthermore , major - mergers are likely to consume most of the fuel for future star formation ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . yet ,",
    "as discussed above , cold molecular gas is not - at - all rare in bulges of disk galaxies .",
    "perhaps successions of minor - mergers with high gas ratios are responsible for pseudobulges formation .",
    "@xcite show that the effect of merging and accretion on the resulting galaxy is a function of the mass ratio .",
    "it is thought , though , that bulge growth by subsequent accretion of mass results in heating and eventually destruction of a galactic disk @xcite , and recent simulations @xcite also suggest that is hard for accretion not to destroy a thin disk .    other scenarios for the formation of bulges have been suggested .",
    "clump instabilities in disks at high redshift can form bulge - like structures in simulations @xcite .",
    "many recent observations show that this process may indeed be happening at high redshift @xcite .",
    "however , recent work by @xcite suggests that bulges built through clump instabilities in simulated galaxies better resemble classical bulges .",
    "one should therefore keep in mind that the population of bulges as a whole , and any one particular bulge , may be the result of more than one of these processes .",
    "is the amount of star formation in typical pseudobulges enough to significantly alter their stellar mass ? this is what we seek to estimate in this paper .",
    "if we assume a continuous gas supply from internal disk evolution , and approximate that historic sfr as a constant , we can use the present - day sfrs in bulges to determine the time - scale for pseudobulge growth .",
    "mass growth in bulges can be described as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the current stellar mass ; @xmath18 is the star formation rate ; @xmath19 is the rate at which previously formed stars are transferred to the bulge ( either by accretion or by secular evolution ) ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the time scales over which each of these phenomena occur ; and finally @xmath22 is that mass that exists initially in the bulge region . assuming constant growth ( and that @xmath23 ) this can be simplified , and solved for @xmath24 , @xmath25 sst provides the ideal instrument to measure @xmath24 .",
    "using the 3.6  @xmath26 luminosity from sst irac ch  1 we can measure @xmath17 , where @xmath27 ( this is discussed in more detail below ) and the 24  @xmath26 luminosity obtained with sst mips ch  1 can measure the star formation rate @xcite .    to measure @xmath22",
    "we subtract the inward extrapolation of an exponential profile fit to the outer disk .",
    "thus we set @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the central mass density of the outer disk , @xmath30 is the scale - length of the outer disk , and @xmath31 is the radius at which the bulge is 25% brighter than the disk .",
    "we set the bulge mass as @xmath32 it is likely that @xmath33 , as defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : mxs ] , is only a rough estimate .",
    "giant disk galaxies may have formed with central profiles that are cuspier than exponentials .",
    "alternatively , some galaxies , such as m  104 , have central holes in the gaseous disk . also , as pseudobulges grow ( at times to @xmath34 ; @xcite and fig .",
    "[ fig : b2 t ] ) the structural parameters of the disk are likely to change . hence , it may follow that inward extrapolation of the outer stellar disk of those galaxies may be inaccurate .",
    "nonetheless , we feel that @xmath33 is likely a reasonable estimate of bulge mass for most galaxies .",
    "we make the approximation that star formation internal to the bulge need only account for a fraction of the mass , hence @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a quantity that measures the amount of stellar mass growth that is from star formation internal to the bulge , and @xmath37 is the sfr at @xmath38 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "the `` growth times '' quoted in this paper will assume @xmath39 unless otherwise stated .",
    "the @xmath36 factor is likely the product of the following two phenomena : ( 1 ) sfrs that are not constant , and , ( 2 ) the fraction of stellar mass that migrates to the bulge .",
    "the ratio of the the present - day sfr to the average historic sfr ( called the _ birth - rate parameter _ , @xmath40 ; @xcite ) is known two range from @xmath41 in local disks galaxies , and is preferentially larger in late - type galaxies @xcite . if pseudobulges are anything like their outer disks , then sa - sbc pseudobulges are likely to have lower values of @xmath42 ( and thus @xmath36 ) than pseudobulges in late - type galaxies .",
    "thus , it is necessary to consider present day sfrs in intermediate - type galaxies with different expectations than those in late - type galaxies .    we can not yet measure the rate at which previously - formed disk stars are transferred to the bulge .",
    "simulations indicate that it is occurring , though .",
    "@xcite finds that a non - negligible amount of stellar mass migrates within the disk in simulated disk galaxies .",
    "further , many pure @xmath43-body simulations are able to move mass around within a disk without the presence of any gas ( e.g.  @xcite ) . also , @xcite",
    "show that accretion of relatively low mass galaxies does not significantly alter a galaxy s sfr .",
    "the total fraction of stellar mass that sfr must therefore account for is @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the mass that is transferred as stars formed outside the bulge , @xmath46 .",
    "there will always be some degeneracy between @xmath24 and @xmath45 , in fact it is possible that the only way we can ever know @xmath45 is through simulation , not observation .",
    "we have no detailed models on which to base our predictions .",
    "yet , we can place them inside the context of disk - galaxy evolution , and use what we know about star formation in disk galaxies to make estimates for how long it might take to form pseudobulges .",
    "typical sfr densities in galactic disks are about @xmath47  m@xmath48  yr@xmath3  kpc@xmath49 @xcite .",
    "bulges are typically about 1  kpc in radius @xcite . therefore ,",
    "if pseudobulges grow stars at similar rates to the high end of the distribution for disks , then we expect them to form roughly @xmath50  m@xmath48  yr@xmath3 . if a bulge is @xmath51  m@xmath48 then it should take a few billion years to make a bulge through internal disk evolution . given that disks are not too much older than 5 - 10  gyr @xcite",
    ", we expect to find the bulges still forming stars today .",
    "also , if pseudobulges form too quickly we run into a problem again , because not every galaxy has a large pseudobulge .",
    "@xcite find that of giant disk galaxies roughly 1/10th are `` simple disks '' meaning they have no detectable bulge when viewed edge - on . we know already",
    "that gas consumption time of the most actively star forming bulges , calculated by @xcite , tend to be in the fast region of this range , about 1  gyr .",
    "thus we suggest that if the growth time of pseudobulges are significantly outside the range of 1 - 10  gyr , then this would pose a problem for secular evolution scenario of pseudobulge formation .",
    "furthermore variations in historic sfr can account for differences of at most a factor of two outside of this range .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study the present day growth of bulges , and thus we wish to sample galaxies with a wide range of bulge properties .",
    "therefore , our sample of 53 galaxies spans the hubble types from sa to sd .",
    "we begin by visually selecting galaxies from the carnegie atlas @xcite with distance less than 20  mpc , such that all galaxies are at least resolved to a few hundred parsecs with mips on board the sst .",
    "also , we restrict our sample to exclude significantly inclined galaxies , we only keep galaxies that satisfy @xmath52<80 .",
    "we also select galaxies that have `` well behaved '' morphology : free of tidal - tails , warps and asymmetries to exclude galaxies with significant interaction - induced star formation .",
    "though not volume limited , our sample is constructed to cover parameter space , especially a sequence in mass . to do this",
    ", we select galaxies covering a range in hubble types from sa to sd ; our sample consists of 15 sa - sab , and 21 sb - sbc , 17 sc - sd galaxies .",
    "galaxies in our sample are not fainter than -17 absolute @xmath53-band magnitude , and they are typically distributed with @xmath54 magnitudes around the mean of -19.5 @xmath53-mags .    the link between non - axisymmetries ( barred and oval distortions ) and secular evolution motivates us to create a sample containing roughly equal numbers of galaxies with a driving agent ( galaxies with a bar and/or an oval ) and galaxies without a driving agent @xcite . indeed , a correlation between central sfr and the presence of bars and ovals has been found .",
    "detection of oval distortions are discussed in @xcite .",
    "they are identified by nested shelves in the surface brightness profile usually having different position angles .",
    "we identify bars by consulting the carnegie atlas of galaxies @xcite , the rc3 @xcite , and visual identification in 3.6  @xmath5 m images .",
    "if a galaxy has both a bar and an oval , we call that galaxy barred .",
    "note that we do not distinguish grand design spirals as a possible secular driver , though they may be able to generate a similar but less extreme effect as bars do ( kk04 ) . in our sample",
    "22 galaxies are unbarred and unovalled , and 31 are driven ( 25 barred and 6 ovaled ) .          in this study",
    ", we classify galaxies as having a pseudobulge using two methods bulge morphology and srsic index .",
    "if the `` bulge '' is or contains a nuclear bar , nuclear spiral , and/or nuclear ring the `` bulge '' is a pseudobulge . also , if the bulge has srsic index less than two , the bulge is called a pseudobulges .",
    "conversely if the bulge is featureless and has a higher srsic index , the bulge is called a classical bulge .",
    "however , @xcite show that about 10% of bulges with srsic index higher than two , have disk - like nuclear morphology . for a detailed description of this method , see @xcite .",
    "examples of nuclear morphology that indicates a bulge as a pseudobulge or a classical bulge are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulgeims ] .",
    "their is significant overlap of our sample with @xcite , 31 galaxies are in both samples .",
    "we therefore use bulge srsic indices from @xcite , when available . for the remaining 23 galaxies we generate new bulge - disk decompositions using archival data from hst archive , sloan digital sky survey , and nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "bulge srsic indices for all galaxies are given in table 1 .    our decomposition method is discussed in the appendix .",
    "we also show results of each new fit in both figure and tabular form .",
    "the method we use to calculate surface brightness profiles and srsic fits to those profiles is the same procedure as used in @xcite .",
    "this procedure is also employed in @xcite on elliptical galaxies .",
    "we refer interested readers to these two papers for more detailed discussions of our reduction and analysis software and procedures .",
    "we identify pseudobulges using hst archival images in the optical wavelength regime ( @xmath53 through @xmath55 ) .",
    "this makes bulge classification subject to the effects of dust .",
    "however , the structures used to identify pseudobulges are usually experiencing enhanced star formation rates , and are easier to detect in the optical region of the spectrum where the mass - to - light ratios are more affected by young stellar populations , rather than in the near infrared where the effects of dust are lesser .",
    "classical bulges may have dust in their center , as do many elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "the presence of dust alone is not enough to classify a galaxy as containing a pseudobulge .",
    "we indicate which galaxies are pseudobulges , and classical bulges in tables 1 & 2 .",
    "these structures are often present , and affect the surface brightness profile , even in the near - ir , at 3.6  @xmath5 m , where differences from varying mass - to - light ratios are minimized .",
    "we use the nasa extragalactic database ned to search for any evidence of close companions of similar magnitude , tidal distortions , or peculiar morphology .",
    "we remove those galaxies which seem to be interacting with other galaxies from our sample .",
    "three galaxies in our sample have companions at @xmath56  kpc , which do not appear to affect the morphology of these galaxies disks .",
    "however , m  51 is a notable exception to this rule as it is currently accreting a smaller galaxy .",
    "imaging data used to calculate fluxes for this paper comes from the following sources : spitzer irac ch  1 ( 3.6  @xmath5 m ) , spitzer mips ch  1 ( 24  @xmath5 m ) , galex fuv @xcite and hst nicmos .",
    "the irac and nicmos images are used to calculate stellar mass ( discussed below ) , and the galex and mips images are used to determine sfrs .",
    "we use post - bcd frames for all spitzer data , and pipeline reduced galex and hst data .",
    "to measure 3.6  @xmath5 m surface brightness profiles we use the code of @xcite .",
    "first , interfering foreground objects are identified in each image and masked .",
    "then , isophotes are sampled by 256 points equally spaced in an angle @xmath57 relating to polar angle by @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the polar angle and @xmath60 is the axial ratio .",
    "an ellipse is then fitted to each isophote by least squares .",
    "the software determines six parameters for each ellipse : relative surface brightness , center position , major and minor axis lengths , and position angle along the major axis .",
    "we then shift the nicmos f160w images ( when available in the archive ) to the same zero point as the irac data .",
    "the composite profile is nicmos data for r<1.22 arcsec , the average of the two profiles when they overlap , and irac 3.6  @xmath5 m data at large radii ( typically @xmath61  arcsec ) .",
    "we note that this procedure assumes a color gradient of zero from @xmath62-band to @xmath63-band in our bulges .",
    "this assumption introduces a source of uncertainty , yet allows for a more complete description of the stellar mass profile . to quantify this uncertainty",
    "we calculate the entire radial surface brightness profile in @xmath63-band using nicmos and 2mass data .",
    "we then shift that profile to have the same zero point as the irac  3.6  @xmath5 m profile , and then calculate the bulge luminosity , which we call @xmath64 .",
    "the difference @xmath65 is scaled by the fraction of light that comes from the shifted nicmos f160w data .",
    "this is taken as the error .",
    "this error is typically less than 5% and rarely larger than errors from other sources , such as fitting uncertainty .",
    "we use nicmos data because it is our belief that the high resolution data increases accuracy , even if precision is compromised slightly .",
    "prior to measuring the bulge flux of mips images we run the images through a few iterations of the lucy - richardson deconvolution routine in iraf ; we are primarily interested in reducing the effects of the airy rings in the mips  24  @xmath5 m point - spread - function ( psf ) .",
    "we construct a psf from point sources in the image",
    ". however , many of our images do not include enough high signal - to - noise point sources ; in this case we use the theoretical psf available on the mips web - site . to calculate the surface brightness profile at 24  @xmath5 m we use the profile tool in the the image analysis package vista @xcite .",
    "the 24  @xmath5 m luminosity is then calculated by integrating the 2-d surface brightness profile to the bulge radius ( @xmath31 ) , determined using the 3.6  @xmath5 m profile .",
    "galactic extinction is considered negligible for 24  @xmath5 m images . aside from deconvolution",
    ", we carry out the same procedure to measure fuv luminosities .",
    "we calculate the extinction in fuv using the results from @xcite and @xcite .    for the 24  @xmath5 m and fuv profiles , we consider two sources of error in calculating our luminosities .",
    "first , uncertainty in the choice of @xmath31 leads to errors in the luminosity calculation .",
    "we choose @xmath31 as the radius at which a galaxy is 25% brighter than the inward extrapolation of an exponential profile fit to the outer disk .",
    "we construct an error to this by simply integrating the luminosity to the next resolved points in the profile .",
    "secondly , we also consider the variance in the image as a source of error .",
    "these two errors are then combined in quadrature to construct the total error in luminosty .",
    "typically the uncertainty due to @xmath31 heavily dominates the total error .",
    "we assume that the near - infrared light is a good tracer of stellar mass due to its weak dependence on star formation history @xcite . in this paper , we calculate stellar mass by using the relation between mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath66 ) and color . we assume that @xmath67 where @xmath68 is determined from optical colors with @xmath69 as in @xcite , and take the mean ratio @xmath70 from @xcite .",
    "we use the @xmath69 color from the rc3 @xcite ; if the galaxy does not have a @xmath69 in the rc3 we use the value from @xcite .",
    "we correct these optical colors for galactic extinction using data from @xcite . for the calculation of stellar mass",
    "we assume that total colors are good estimates of the stellar populations of the bulges ; this may introduce a source of uncertainty .",
    "however , the color of the bulge has been shown to be very similar to the color of the outer disk in intermediate type galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus it is likely a safe assumption .",
    "one difficulty in measuring the sfr in bulges of galaxies is that active galactic nuclei can contribute significantly to the mid - ir flux in the centers of galaxies .",
    "most of the galaxies in our sample have an active non - thermal source in their center ; what remains is to determine what the typical effect is and which galaxies are most heavily affected .",
    "we use irac  8  @xmath5 m to determine which galaxies have strong nuclear point sources due to their increased angular resolution . in a few galaxies in our original sample , over 80% of the bulge light is contained within a point source in the 8  @xmath5 m images .",
    "we identify this light as non - thermal by comparing the [ oiii]/h@xmath36 and [ nii]/h@xmath71 line - ratios @xcite and exclude these galaxies from the rest of the study .",
    "the excluded galaxies are ngc  1068 , ngc  4258 , and ngc  5273 .",
    "we find that for the remaining galaxies the point sources typically make up less than 10% of the bulge light .",
    "this is within the typical amount of measurement uncertainty so that it is not necessary to account for contributions from the remaining low - luminosity active galactic nuclei in the rest of the sample . in @xcite",
    "we directly investigate connections between growth of pseudobulges and the growth of central active galactic nuclei .      in optically thick environments ,",
    "massive young stars heat dust grains which re - radiate that light in the ir .",
    "even though newly formed stars are easily detected in the uv , even small amounts of internal extinction within those galaxies will hamper efforts to measure the sfr only using uv light .",
    "for this reason , ir emission has and continues to be a good indicator of sfrs in most galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , different galaxies have differing opacities , and this difference can depend on the ages of the stars being probed and the amount of star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "thus , a linear correlation with the pa@xmath71 luminosity would imply that the sfr indicator is robust . however , there are important distinctions between the methods used in this paper and those of @xcite .",
    "they measure luminosity of the central regions of galaxies by summing the luminosity of individual point sources within those images ; we measure luminosity , as described above , using isosphote measurements .",
    "each method has advantages and disadvantages , and we do not wish to claim either is better or worse . our method will measure a certain amount of diffuse emission that may not have been counted by @xcite , and because we calculate isophotes based on the mean value of an ellipse , our method may underestimate the luminosity of extremely bright knots of star formation .",

    "nonetheless , we observe that most galaxies in our sample are increasing @xmath0 through present day star formation .",

    "if secular evolution is occurring in all galaxies with disks , those galaxies who no longer have as much fuel for significant star formation , namely red sequence galaxies , would simply not grow as much .",
    "the time scales of pseudobulge growth we observe are similar to the time - scale of bulge formation in simulations @xcite .",
    "yet present - day star formation in more massive pseudobulges in our sample can only account for half of their stellar mass within a reasonable time - frame .",
    "it is likely that the sfr of pseudobulges were higher in the past just as higher historic sfrs in the past are typical in disk galaxies @xcite .",

    "[ fig : struct ] . also , late - type bulges are roughly the same size as pseudobulges ( as measured by @xmath104 ) .",
    "thus , it appears that adding stellar mass to late - type bulges would make them similar to pseudobulges in intermediate - type galaxies .",
    "is there enough gas in the bulges of late - type galaxies to build a pseudobulge in the future ?",
    "we combine the central surface density of gas from bima song @xcite and our sfr densities to determine gas consumption time scales .",

    "a more rigorous study is needed for a more accurate analysis .",
    "we find gas consumption times of 5 - 8  gyr , very similar to the typical pseudobulge doubling time which is about 5  gyr .",
    "however , some of the smaller late - type bulges are an order of magnitude smaller than the typical pseudobulge .",
    "we combine our sample with nuclear gas masses from @xcite ; we find that if late - type pseudobulges continue consuming the gas in their centers at the same rates as today , only the few with the highest nuclear gas masses ( which typically have @xmath120  m@xmath2  yr@xmath3 ) will be able to build a pseudobulge before running out of gas in the center .",
    "thus if the smaller pseudobulges in late - type galaxies with lower sfr are to build larger pseudobulges , then gas must be driven inward from the outer disk . however , as discussed by @xcite it is not trivial to get the gas to the center of the galaxy .",
    "nonetheless , we ask if there is a large enough reservoir of gas in the whole galaxy to supply late - type bulges with enough gas to grow a pseudobulges more similar to those in intermediate - type galaxies .",
    "some late - type bulges have capacity to grow into typical pseudobulges , but not all . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fgas ] , we compare the gas mass fraction , @xmath121 , to bulge - to - total ratio ( top panel ) and the sfr density of the bulge ( bottom panel ) .",

    "there is enough gas in the entire galaxy in the lowest @xmath0 pseudobulges systems to build a bulge with @xmath123 ( given that the process of gas inflow and conversion into stars can maintain an efficiency of order 10% ) .",
    "however , at the current sfr this would take longer than a hubble time for smaller late - type pseudobulges .",
    "there is some evidence that disk mass plays an important role . in fig .",
    "[ fig : diskmass ] we show that massive bulges exist only in massive disks , and that the spread in @xmath0 increases for lower - mass disks . yet",

    "these three properties are similar to m  63 , an unbarred sbc galaxy with @xmath127 , a total sfr of @xmath128 , and gas fraction of @xmath129 .",
    "the total mass is less than a factor of 2 different , the total sfr is similar , yet m  63 has a pseudobulge mass of @xmath130 but m  101 has a bulge that is 2 orders of magnitude smaller , @xmath131 .",
    "it seems that having a large disk mass is necessary , but not sufficient to form a large pseudobulge .",
    "bars in early type galaxies are longer than bars in late - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "it may be that bars observed in sa - sbc galaxies are able to fuel more active growth of pseudobulges than bars in later types .",
    "however , @xcite show with simulations that as bars grow they also slow down and become longer ; therefore it seems possible that the difference in bar types is a consequence of the difference in bulge mass , or at least they arise from a common process",
    ". also recall from fig .",
    "[ fig : drivers ] , that barred galaxies are not showing faster @xmath0 growth .",
    "it is possible that some other process such as external accretion of satellites could supply the disk with cold gas that may foster secular evoution ( see * ? ? ?",
    ". it may be worth noting that warps in disks due to accretion survive in simulations for times that are comparable to the typical growth time of a pseuodbulges , a few gyr @xcite .",
    "if accretion triggers internal evolution , this generates a seeemingly arbitrary , and possibly unobservable , distinction between those galaxies that form large pseudobulges ( @xmath132% ) and those with almost no bulge at all , as in m  101 .    other possibilities for generating the differences between galaxies with massive pseudobulges and those with small pseudobulges include dark matter halo - triaxiality or other couplings between baryonic mass and dark matter properties ( * ?",
    "* e.g. ) . finally , it may just be a matter of time .",
    "[ fig : diskmass ] shows that late - type bulges and pseudobulges at the same disk mass have the same sfr density ; if internal evolution continues driving gas to the centers of late - type disk galaxies it may be that in a few gyr m  101 will look similar to galaxies like ngc  5055 in @xmath0 as well as in other properties .      in  [ sec : sfr ] we distinguish galaxies based upon two seperate properties .",
    "first , galaxies are seperated via morphology ; we call those bulges that possess disk - like structure , as outlined in @xcite , pseudobulges and those with bulges that better resemble e - type galaxies classical bulges .",
    "however , we notice that the set of pseudobulges has two subsets : those that actively form stars and those that are inactive .    in all cases involving star formation rates ,",
    "inactive pseudobulges are found between ( active ) pseudobulges and classical bulges . yet",
    ", their nuclear morphology is similar to pseudobulges .",
    "furthermore , they have srsic index less than two , which strengthens the claim that they are pseudobulges @xcite .",
    "however , in the structural parameter correlations , presented in @xcite , when we distinguish the bulges based not just on morphology but also specific sfr the inactive pseudobulges appear more like classical bulges than pseudobulges .",
    "their true nature is thus , somewhat uncertain .",
    "inactive pseudobulges seem to be transition objects in parameter space , and possibly in formation mechanism . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ssfr_diskbulge ] we show that all bulges in our sample are growing faster than their outer disk , and this is independent of the type of bulge .",
    "thus , if secular evolution is driving this trend , and if the bulge is small enough and the disk has enough gas , it is possible that a pseudobulge could grow on top of the classical bulge . in this case",
    "the bulge mass would be high with respect to the sfr , because a large fraction of the mass is in a classical bulge .",
    "this argument is supported by the fact that inactive pseudobulges typically have higher @xmath0 than active pseudobulges .",
    "secondly , it is also possible that inactive pseudobulges are galaxies in which secular evolution is effectively shutting off .",
    "we note again that inactive pseudobulges are the largest @xmath0 pseudobulges , thus it is possible that the disk has built a large bulge that now stabilzes the disk against large scale instabilities , as has been seen in many simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , this would not explain why inactive pseudobulges look more similar to classical bulges in structural parameter correlations .",
    "it is possible that we are seeing externally driven star formation in a few classical bulges .",
    "this would explain why the structural properties of inactive pseudobulges are so similar to classical bulges , seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : struct ] . also , it appears that in both the @xmath93 and @xmath133 planes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_xs ] ) inactive pseudobulges show similar behavior to classical bulges that is shifted slightly toward higher sfr .",
    "we note that m  81 , which is denoted in each figure as a red triangle , has a classical bulge and the galaxy is known to be interacting with nearby m  82 .",
    "thus , it has dust in the bulge that is easily seen in mips and irac  8  @xmath5 m images @xcite .",
    "inactive pseudobulges have different optical morphology and also much higher specific sfr than m  81 .",
    "however , since m  81 is the largest bulge in our sample , it is probably not the best comparison object .",
    "this would imply that the method classifying bulges based on the presence of disk - like morpholgy may be flawed in this respect , and that 6 out of 22 pseudobulges in our sample would be misclassified .",
    "however , it would be hard to explain why inactive pseudobulges have srsic indices below 2 just like pseudobulges and unlike any classical bulges .",
    "given these three possibilities we do not know what the true nature of inactive pseuodbulges is .",
    "it is quite possible that inactive pseudobulges are a mixed bag of objects , that some are evolved pseudobulges , others true composites , and some are active classical bulges .",
    "furture work involving dynamics may be more revealing of their physical nature .",
    "nonetheless , the existance of inactive pseuodbulges in no way denies the fact that active pseuodbulges are growing rapidly .",
    "we note in tables  1  &  2 that these galaxies do not have significantly perturbed global morphology .",
    "recall that in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_xs ] we show that some pseudobulges have sufficient sfr to double their stellar mass in 1 - 2  gyr .",
    "if this star formation were due to non - secular means , ( namely mergers ) it is unlikely that the merger remnant would have relaxed so much as to form a cold disk with a central bulge yet star burst .",
