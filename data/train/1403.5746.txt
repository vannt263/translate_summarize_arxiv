    "the moving puncture method is a successful approach for the simulation of black holes , see @xcite for pedagogic explanations and references .",
    "numerically the method can be applied to multiple , spinning black holes in quasi - circular or eccentric orbits , but analytical results are only known for the schwarzschild spacetime . without spin and linear momentum",
    "a single black hole settles down to a stationary state similar to a trumpet , containing one asymptotically flat end and one with finite schwarzschild radius , e.g.  @xcite . in this article",
    "we begin an investigation of punctures in axisymmetry by performing numerical experiments of rotating black holes .",
    "we will show that the spinning puncture settles down to a stationary state similar to the spherical symmetric case and generalize results obtained for the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "a short description about possible modification of the ansatzes of @xcite will be given , which offers the possibility to read off the spin value directly without additional computational costs .",
    "we use the bam - code @xcite for fully general relativistic evolutions with the moving puncture method @xcite . unless otherwise stated the total mass of the system @xmath0",
    "is set to unity and the spin axis is equivalent to the z - axis .",
    "we use the bssn @xcite evolution scheme for the numerical evolution . as a particular gauge choice ,",
    "we apply the commonly used 1+log - slicing condition @xcite together with the @xmath1-driver shift @xcite .",
    "this special choice , sometimes called moving puncture coordinates , is well established in numerical relativity and widely used .      as a starting point , we want to demonstrate that for spinning punctures a stationary state is reached similar to the one in spherical symmetry . for this purpose",
    ", we consider the trace of the extrinsic curvature @xmath2 as a function of the lapse @xmath3 , because @xmath4 is independent of the spatial coordinates as long as we use the same slicing condition for all simulations .",
    "when a stationary state is reached , the difference of @xmath4 between two hypersurfaces , i.e.@xmath5 becomes zero for @xmath6 . in fig .",
    "[ picstat1 ] we compare directly the spinning and the non - spinning configuration .",
    "we know that the non - spinning puncture reaches a stationary state and the same seems to be true for the spinning black hole .",
    "additionally , one can show that the time derivatives of the evolution variables become zero .",
    "we checked this for the lapse @xmath3 by computing the right hand side of the 1+log - slicing condition , e.g.  for a black hole with @xmath7 the derivative after @xmath8 is smaller than @xmath9 .    , scaledwidth=100.0% ]    , scaledwidth=100.0% ]      the stationary state in spherical symmetry can be computed semi - analytically .",
    "the lapse behaves near the puncture like @xmath10 , see @xcite .",
    "we find an exponent of @xmath11 when we use our numerical data and apply the fitting function @xmath12 .",
    "we can do the same for the conformal factor @xmath13 and get for @xmath14 with @xmath15 an exponent of @xmath16 , while @xmath17 is the analytical result .",
    "one should mention that we are using the radial coordinate of our numerical grid @xmath18 , which does not necessarily agree with the isotropic radius for which the exponents were derived in @xcite , but because of the particular gauge choices both descriptions become approximately the same near the puncture .",
    "thus , we will use the coordinate radius to get a better insight in the numerical simulation , not necessarily in the geometry of the spacetime . according to fig .",
    "[ picexp ] the exponents of @xmath3 and @xmath19 change differently , depending on the axis between the spin and the axis used for the fit .",
    "remarkable is that even when the exponent is decreasing the puncture method works and can handle the non - differentiable functions .",
    "the important point is that although the regularity of the functions is reduced , compared with spherical symmetry , the moving puncture method does not fail .",
    "this effect could explain why stationary spinning punctures are less accurate than non - spinning punctures in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "additionally , the angular dependence of the exponent @xmath20 complicates possible attempts to factor out the singularity analytically .",
    "independent of the non - integer powers of @xmath18 for @xmath3 and @xmath19 , we can use a taylor expansion to model the behavior near the black hole , see @xcite for the description in spherical symmetry .",
    "considering axisymmetry we have to introduce an additional angular dependence , where we define @xmath21 as the angle between the axis of rotation @xmath22 and @xmath23 as the outward - pointing unit radial vector .",
    "this dependence is described reasonably well with spherical harmonics , e.g.  for the trace of the extrinsic curvature @xmath24 , where we choose @xmath25 to encode axisymmetry in the components @xmath26 .",
    "the same holds for the other bssn scalars .",
    "the shift vector @xmath27 in axial symmetry can be described by @xmath28 where we introduced the additional term @xmath29 .",
    "a closed description of the extrinsic curvature @xmath30 and the conformal metric @xmath31 is more complicated and is explained up to some point in @xcite .",
    "an important issue during the numerical evolution of black holes is obtaining a good estimate of the black hole spin . using the properties of the stationary state described in sec .",
    "[ stationary ] , it is simple to find the spin of a non - moving black hole evolved with the puncture gauge . for increasing spin",
    "the absolute value of @xmath2 at the puncture , @xmath32 , becomes smaller .",
    "the behavior is well approximated by a quadratic function .",
    "inverting this formula leads to @xmath33 which correlates an evolution variable of the bssn scheme and properties of the underlying spacetime .",
    "thus , we are able to read off the amplitude of the spin of a non - moving puncture simply by measuring @xmath32 . to get the entire information of the black hole spin we need the spin axis .",
    "this can be found with the lapse @xmath3 .",
    "our experiments showed that the coordinate distance between the origin and a contour line is smallest when we look along the rotation axis , see fig .",
    "[ plot : contour ] .",
    "the direction of rotation can be determined with the shift vector @xmath27 , because of the additional term @xmath29 .",
    "empirical studies showed @xmath34 , so we can find the sign of @xmath35 by regarding @xmath27 along one axis .",
    "the first test for the validity of our new algorithm are single black hole simulations .",
    "table  [ testcases ] shows some test cases in which the spin was calculated using bam s curvature flow apparent horizon finder and the new method . for further tests we include results for the final remnant of a mixed binary ( bhns ) and a neutron star binary ( nsns ) merger . comparing with the apparent horizon finder ,",
    "the results agree within the estimated uncertainty .    to define the measurement uncertainty we investigate every part of our algorithm individually .",
    "the first step is to determine the absolute spin value with the help of the interpolation function  ( [ s(k ) ] ) .",
    "the error comes from the estimate of @xmath32 and can be evaluated by using different resolutions . using the corresponding uncertainty , we can compute the error according to equation  ( [ s(k ) ] ) , including also the standard error of the regression .",
    "the second step of our algorithm defines the angular uncertainty .",
    "considering a box with @xmath36 grid points the angular error is approximately @xmath37 , in our case @xmath38 . on the other hand using an interpolation to find the level surface one achieves a much lower uncertainty of around @xmath39 .",
    "because the last step of our algorithm uses only the qualitative behavior of @xmath27 , it comes without an additional error . we can sum up that our method determines the spin with an uncertainty of @xmath40 and an angular resolution of at least @xmath41 for @xmath42 . for smaller spins the change of @xmath43 in equation ( [ s(k ) ] ) is small , which leads to higher uncertainties .",
    "furthermore , equation ( [ s(k ) ] ) was defined as an adequate function for @xmath44 $ ] , nevertheless using higher resolution for higher spins the method is applicable as well .",
    "l l    .single black hole simulations ( left ) and results for the final remnant for a binary merger ( right ) .",
    "the first line refers to the new algorithm , the second line to the apparent horizon finder . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ testcases ]",
    "we presented numerical results for rotating black holes and generalized the ansatzes of @xcite . for spinning punctures a simple @xmath45-model for the evolution variables is possible , where in contrast to spherical symmetry the exponent depends on the angle @xmath21 .",
    "this complicates attempts to factor out the singularity analytically . in the future we plan to use these results to find an analytical description for a rotating black hole using the moving puncture gauge .",
    "additionally , a fast algorithm was introduced to determine the spin of a non - moving puncture . adding linear momentum to a spinning black hole to obtain a binary orbit breaks the axisymmetry , but a generalization of the numerical method appears possible .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank d. hilditch and g. loukes - gerakopoulos for helpful discussions and comments .",
