    "strangeness production in relativistic heavy ion collisions may provide detailed information on the collision dynamics @xcite .",
    "the enhanced production of strangeness in nucleus - nucleus collisions is predicted to be a signature that the collisions go through a deconfined stage - namely the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 valence quark content for the @xmath0 meson is of particular interest : the production of @xmath0 meson may be sensitive to strangeness enhancement @xcite .",
    "the possible mass and decay width modification of @xmath0 meson due to the expected partial chiral symetry restoration and in medium effect in the hot and dense matter has been a topic of both theoretical and experimental investigations @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 meson may retain the information from the early partonic stage of the collisions since it is expected that @xmath0 meson interacts weakly with nonstrange hadrons during the hadronic stage @xcite .",
    "finally , the comparison of the production of @xmath0 meson in au+au and pp collisions at the same beam energy may yield knowledge on the production mechanisms of @xmath0 meson and the evolution dynamics of the colliding system .",
    "the results on @xmath0 meson production at @xmath1 = 130 gev from the star detector have been reported in @xcite .",
    "the data presented here was taken by the star detector @xcite during the second run of rhic collider in the year 2001 .",
    "the main components of the star detector used in this analysis are a large acceptance time projection chamber ( tpc ) @xcite , a central trigger barrel ( ctb ) and two zero degree calorimeters .",
    "the tpc is placed in an uniform magnetic field as the tracking device for charged particles .",
    "the ctb and zdc are used for triggering . in this analysis",
    "about 2.1 m events from minimum bias trigger data and 1.0 m events from central trigger data in au+au collisions and 4 m events from minimum bias trigger data in pp collisions are used after all event selection cuts @xcite .",
    "the particle identification is achieved by correlating the measured energy loss ( @xmath8 ) of the particle in the tpc gas with its momentum . in this analysis ,",
    "a track is selected as a kaon candidate as long as its @xmath8 is within @xmath9 of the kaon bethe - bloch curve . due to limited resolusion of the detector , the pion and kaon",
    "de / dx bands merge at momentum greater than 0.7 gev , resulting in the pion contamination in the kaon candidates .",
    "the centrality in au+au collisions is defined by the fraction of the total inelastic hadronic cross - section , i.e. by dividing the raw charged hadron multiplicity distribution into centrality classes .",
    "the @xmath0 signal is built by calculating the invariant mass of every selected @xmath10@xmath5 pair .",
    "the shape of the combinatorial background is calculated by event mixing technique @xcite . for the au+au data analysis , each event is mixed with another event in the same centrality class , while each event is mixed with four other events in the pp data analysis in order to get a better description of the background with higher statistics .",
    "the background subtracted @xmath10@xmath5 pair invariant mass distribution averaged over 0.4 gev / c @xmath11 3.9 gev / c is shown in figure [ invariantmasspeak ] .",
    "the @xmath0 peak is fit to a breit - wigner function plus a linear function representing the background in each @xmath12 bin .",
    "the measured mass for the @xmath0 meson in both au+au and pp collisions is @xmath13 mev/@xmath14 , which is consistent with the @xmath0 meson mass from the particle data group @xcite .",
    "the measured width is also consistent with the @xmath0 natural width convoluted with the resolution of the star detector .",
    "the residual background at mass region greater than 1.06 gev/@xmath14 mainly comes from @xmath15 decay products when pions are misidentified as kaons .",
    "a small fraction of it may also come from @xmath16 decays where both of its decay daughters are misidentified as kaons .    in order to obtain the resonance yield , detector acceptance and efficiency corrections",
    "were applied to the uncorrected number of @xmath0 for each centrality and @xmath12 bin .",
    "the acceptance and efficiency corrections were done by embedding simulated kaons from @xmath0 decays into real events using geant , and by passing them through the full reconstruction chain @xcite .",
    "the corrected @xmath0 invariant multiplicity distributions at mid - rapidity ( @xmath17 0.5 ) as a function of @xmath18 are depicted in figure [ spectra ] , where @xmath19 = 1019.4 mev / c@xmath20 is the average @xmath0 mass reported in @xcite .",
    "the transverse momentum coverage for this measurement is 0.4 @xmath11 3.9 gev/@xmath21 , which corresponds to 85@xmath22 of the @xmath0 yield at mid - rapidity . in au+au collisions ,",
    "the spectra are fitted by an exponential function in @xmath18 for all centrality bins . in pp collisions ,",
    "the spectrum is better represented by a power law function in @xmath12 .",
    "thus the spectra shape changes from pp to au+au collisions . in au+au collisions , the inverse slopes extracted from the exponential function fit to the spectra do not depend strongly on the collision centrality .",
    "the @xmath0 yield ( @xmath23 ) obtained from the fit to the spectra in au+au collisions as a function of rapidity is shown in figure [ dndyvsrap ] .",
    "the measured @xmath0 dn / dy is flat as a function of rapidity within the errors , which is consistent with boost invariance for the @xmath0 production in au+au collisions at rhic energy in the measured rapidity range .",
    "the @xmath0 @xmath3 calculated from the fits to the spectra as a function of the number of charged particles is depicted in figure [ meanpt ] , where the solid triangle and the solid circles sketch the measurements in pp and au+au collisions , respectively . in this figure ,",
    "the @xmath3 of @xmath4 , k@xmath24 and @xmath6 from @xcite are also plotted , where the open triangles represent the @xmath3 obtained in pp interactions and the open circles correspond to the @xmath3 measured in au+au collisions for different centralities .",
    "the @xmath3 of @xmath4 , k@xmath24 and @xmath6 increases from peripheral to central collisions and from lighter to heavier particles .",
    "the @xmath4 @xmath3 increase from pp and most peripheral au+au collisions to the most central au+au collisions is about 10@xmath22 . in the case of k@xmath24 and @xmath6 ,",
    "the increase is about 25@xmath22 and 60@xmath22 , respectively .",
    "this behavior is expected from collective flow picture with hadronic rescattering .",
    "the @xmath0 meson has a very different behavior : its @xmath3 increases from pp collisions to au+au collisions . however , there is little increase from peripherial au+au to central au+au collisions although its mass is even higher than that of @xmath6 .",
    "some hadronic hydrodynamic calculations , for example @xcite predicts collective flow expansion in proportion to particle mass , such as those exhibited by @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . the centrality dependence of @xmath3 for the @xmath0 meson shows a distintive difference from that for the @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this may indicate that the evolution dynamics of the @xmath0 meson is less sensitive to hadronic rescattering .",
    "we have presented rusults on @xmath0 meson production at mid - rapidity in au+au and pp collisions at @xmath1 = 200 gev .",
    "the spectrum in pp collisions is significantly different from that in au+au collisions .",
    "the spectra in au+au collisions weakly depend on the collision centralities .",
    "the extracted @xmath0 yield is flat as a function of rapidity , which is consistent with boost invariance for the @xmath0 production in the measured rapidity range .",
    "the weak dependence of @xmath0 @xmath3 on the centralities in au+au collisions is consistent with the expectation that @xmath0 does not interact strongly with nonstrange hadronic matter .",
