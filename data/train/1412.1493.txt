    "the bundle fiber is expanded to include both scalar fields and vector spaces .",
    "this takes account of the fact that scalar fields are included in the description of vector spaces . for gauge theories a fiber at @xmath1 includes a complex scalar field , @xmath20 with @xmath21 for tangent bundles each fiber includes a real scalar field , @xmath22 with a tangent space , @xmath23 this expansion is achieved by use of the fiber product @xcite of two bundles . because @xmath0 is flat all the fiber bundles considered here are product bundles .",
    "number scaling is accounted for by expansion of the bundle fiber to include pairs of scaled scalar fields and vector spaces for all scaling factors .",
    "the scaling factors are complex for gauge theories and real for geometric properties .",
    "this work expands earlier work on number scaling by the author @xcite in that fiber bundles play an essential role .",
    "scaling is accounted for by use of a space or space time dependent real or complex valued scaling field .",
    "vertical components of connections between fibers at neighbor locations on @xmath0 are based on this field .",
    "this work also differs from the earlier work in that the vector scaling fields , as gradients of the scaling field are integrable . in earlier work vector scaling fields",
    "were used with no connection to scalar fields . as a result",
    "the integrability of the fields was open .",
    "scaling is by no means new in physics and geometry .",
    "it was used almost 100 years ago by weyl @xcite to construct a complete differential geometry.weyl introduced a nonintegrable real vector field to describe the scaling under parallel transfer of quantities .",
    "the problem , as noted by einstein @xcite , was that this required that the properties of measuring rods , clocks , and atomic spectra depend on their past history .",
    "he also noted that this contradicts the known physical properties of rods , clocks , and atomic spectra . a good description of weyl s work , including einstein s remarks and subsequent developments of early gauge theory are in a book by oraifeartaigh @xcite .",
    "] scaling is an important component of renormalization theory @xcite , scale invariance of physical quantities , and of conformal field theories @xcite .",
    "the number structure scaling used here in the connections between fibers is different from these types of scaling .",
    "it differs from conformal transformations in that both angles between vectors and vector lengths are scaled .",
    "the scaling of angles may seem strange and counterintuitive .",
    "however , as will be seen , this does not cause problems . for example , the properties of number scaling are such that trigonometric relations are preserved under scaled parallel transfer from one fiber to another .",
    "the basic difference between the scaling used here and the other types of scaling used in physics is that both quantities and multiplication operations are scaled .",
    "the scaling must be such that the axiom validity of the number and vector space structures is preserved under scaling .",
    "the type of scaling used here and in earlier work is closest to that in a recent paper in which functional relations between number structures of different types include the basic operations as well as the quantities @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is to first describe the salient aspects of scaling for both number and vector space structures . because of its importance to the rest of this work",
    ", it is done in some detail in section [ ns ] .",
    "section [ fb ] comes next with a description of the parts of the theory of fiber bundles that are needed here .",

    "the real part of the gradient can have any mass including @xmath25 inclusion of the electromagnetic field does not affect these mass conditions .",
    "the lagrangian for the mexican hat potential with the scaling field present is used in subsection [ hmabf ] to find the effect of the higgs mechanism on the scaling field .",
    "the @xmath11 field combines with a goldstone boson to give a massive vector boson , a photon , and a higgs field .",
    "the @xmath15 field remains with any mass possible .",
    "the very speculative possibility that @xmath15 might be the gradient of the higgs field is noted .",
    "the effect of scaling on some geometric quantities occupies section [ nsg ] .",
    "both curve lengths and the geodesic equation are derived .",
    "it is seen that scaling affects the proper time of clocks carried along a path .",
    "experimental restrictions on the possible physical properties of @xmath15 and @xmath11 are discussed in section [ erab ] .",
    "the lack of direct physical evidence for the presence of the @xmath15 and @xmath11 fields means that the values of these fields , in a region of cosmological space and time occupiable by us as observers and by other intelligent beings with whom we can effectively communicate , must be too small to be observed .",
    "there are no restrictions on the values of these fields outside the region .",
    "the region should be small with respect to the size of the observable universe .",
    "section [ c ] concludes the paper .",
    "it is noted that number scaling has no effect on comparisons of computations with one another or with results of measurements carried out at different space time points .",
    "it should be noted that the idea of local mathematical structures is not new .",
    "it has been described in the context of category theory in which locality refers to structure interpretations in different categories @xcite . here",
    "locality refers to locations in space time .",
    "locality in gauge field theories has also been discussed @xcite , but not with respect to mathematical structures .",
    "a brief but explicit description of number scaling is in order as it is basic to all that follows .",
    "one begins with the observation that mathematics is based on a collection of structures of different types of mathematical systems with relations or maps between them @xcite .",
    "a structure consists of a base set , and a few basic operations , relations , and constants for which a relevant set of axioms are true .",
    "these are referred to as models in mathematical logic @xcite .",

    "the complex conjugation operation has been added as a basic operation to @xmath34 as it makes the development much easier .    as usually used , these structures conflate two distinct concepts , that of numbers as elements of the base sets , and that of number values acquired by the base set elements as part of a structure containing the base set .",

    "this is the simplest example of the distinction between numbers as base set elements and number values of the base set elements in structures .",

    "the remaining effects are shown by the presence of the term , @xmath535 this arises from the effect of path variation on the field @xmath292 in the exponential , @xmath536    it is tempting to follow the argument in general relativity @xcite by saying that the first two terms of either eq . [ geod1 ] or [ geodcov ] represent the motion of a particle in the presence of the field , @xmath424 in this case the third term acts like a force on the particle , also generated by @xmath424 however , one must keep in mind that the effect of @xmath292 , or , more accurately , of the gradient vector field , @xmath537 on particle motion , arises from the connection between the fibers of the tangent bundle .",

    "the lack of evidence is also the case for the @xmath15 field in the geometric quantities described here .",
    "would also affect geometric quantities . ]",
    "this lack of physical evidence must be reconciled with the properties of the @xmath15 and @xmath11 fields .",
    "one way to achieve reconciliation is to use a scenario in which @xmath0 represents cosmological space and time .",
    "time varies from the big bang , about @xmath539 years ago , to the present and beyond .",
    "space positions vary over the observable universe .",
    "general relativity is neglected here .",
    "this description of @xmath0 means that the fiber bundles , described in earlier sections , are bundles of fibers over all of space and time , from the big bang to the present , and over all locations of the universe .",
    "it follows that numerical values of geometric and physical quantities are local in that they are expressed as real numerical quantities in a fiber @xmath540 at some location @xmath8 examples of this are curve lengths in eq .",
    "[ lfxp ] and the geodesic equation , eq .",
    "[ geodcov ] .",
    "both are numerical values in @xmath541    a direct comparison of these scaled quantities with experimental results must take account of the fact that all experiments and measurements are necessarily local .",
    "they must occur in a region of space and time that is either occupied or can be occupied by observers .",
    "the reason is that observers are needed to implement the relevant measurement procedures .",
    "this is the case whether one is measuring properties of locally produced systems or of incoming radiation emitted by systems at cosmological distances .",
    "consider all geometric or physical quantities whose description is limited to a region of space and time that is or can be occupied by observers .",
    "this includes such things as lengths of paths in the region or wave packets whose extent is limited to the region .",
    "the lack of evidence for number scaling effects in this region means that both @xmath542 and @xmath543 to the limits of experimental accuracy in the region .",
    "it says nothing about the values of @xmath544 or @xmath545 outside the region",
    ". they can be quite large and vary rapidly in very far away regions in space and time , including those near and after the big bang .",
    "the size of this region is not known .",
    "however it must include , at least , regions already occupied by observers .",
    "this includes the surface of the earth .",
    "since we , as observers , are in principle capable of interplanetary travel , the region should include the solar system .",
    "the region should also include other planets and areas around other nearby stars which are in reasonable communication distances from us .",
    "a generous estimate of the size of this region is that of a sphere about @xmath546 light years in diameter @xcite roughly centered on the solar system .",
    "the exact size of this region is not important .",
    "what is relevant is that the region is a small fraction of the observable universe .",
    "the size is predicated on the idea that observers in locations outside the region are too far away for us to know that they exist or for us to communicate with them , now or in the future .",
    "this work represents some advances over earlier work on the topic of number scaling @xcite .",
    "these include advances in the explanation of number scaling and in the use of fiber bundles .",
    "the advances in number scaling consist of a clearer separation of numbers , as elements of the base set of a type ( real , complex , etc . ) of number structure , from the values they have in a particular scaled structure .",
    "the essential point to remember is that for each type of number , the elements of a base set , as numbers have no predetermined value .",
    "they acquire values only inside a structure that satisfies a set of axioms for the type of number being considered .",
    "it was seen that for each number type many different structures can be described where the value of each of the base set elements depends on the structure containing them .",
    "this is the meaning of number scaling .",
    "an advantage of the use of fiber bundles is that the bundles make a clear distinction between local mathematical structures , as elements of fibers at different locations on a space time manifold , @xmath312 and global mathematical structures that do not belong to any fiber .",
    "these exist outside of space and time @xcite and are outside of any fiber bundle whose base space is @xmath453 elements of some global structures serve as connections between the fibers .",
    "there is much more work to be done .",
    "this includes extension to include the effects of scaling on many other physical and geometric quantities , besides the few described here , and expansion to include general relativity .",
    "also more work is needed to determine the physical nature , if any , of the @xmath15 and @xmath11 fields .",
    "one may hope that these fields correspond to physical fields , but much more work is needed to see if this is true or not .",
    "another area that needs additional investigation is the nature of the base set elements of number structures and of other types of structures .",
    "in particular the relationship between these elements and physical systems needs investigation .",
    "quantum mechanical representations of numbers may be useful here .",
    "this is especially the case when one considers that expressions of numbers and number properties , as alphabet symbol strings , are usually described classically .",
    "this follows from the observation that symbols in a string are assumed to have particular intrinsic values irrespective of whether or not they are bing examined .",
    "one point about the effect of number scaling mentioned in earlier work @xcite deserves to be emphasized again .",
    "this is that scaling plays no role in comparisons between outputs of experiments with one another or with outputs of computations as theoretical predictions of experimental results .",
    "this might seem surprising in that comparison of a computational output as a number value at @xmath1 with an experimental result as a number value at @xmath239 can only be done locally at some point of @xmath0 . in the presence of scaling , transferral of the number value at @xmath239 to @xmath1 requires multiplication of the experimental result by a scaling factor .",
    "the scaled number value is then compared locally with the number value of the computation output .",
    "the problem is that physics gives no hint of any such scaling .",
    "this is not a problem when one realizes that outputs of experiments and computations , as physical processes , are never number values .",
    "they are physical systems in physical states .",
    "they can be interpreted as number values but these are local interpretations that refer to the output locations .",
    "comparison of the outputs requires physical transportation of the information in the output states to a common location . at this location , the two output states , interpreted as number values at the same point ,",
    "are compared _",
    "locally_. no number scaling is involved .    in conclusion one",
    "hopes that this work is a contribution to the more general topic of the basic relationship between mathematics and physics .",
    "this is a topic that has interested this author @xcite , and many others @xcite .",
