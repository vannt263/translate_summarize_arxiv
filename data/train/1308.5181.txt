    "previous models of coagulation and fragmentation of an ensemble of dust aggregates often assumed that a collision between particles of particular sizes occurs with a single velocity . we develop a more physically - motivated model for the collision velocities .",
    "the key features are : ( i ) a particle s velocity is _ not _ single - valued but is described by a probability distribution function ( pdf ) ; ( ii ) a particle s velocity in any direction is a gaussian with a mean given by the deterministic velocity in that direction ( i.e. radial drift , azimuthal drift or vertical settling ) and a standard deviation given by the stochastic velocities ( i.e. turbulence & brownian motion ) .",
    "the analytical 1d pdf of _ relative velocities _ in each direction is produced for each pair of particles , and combined to give a 3d collision velocity pdf .",
    "we assume that collisions with velocities lower than the bouncing velocity , @xmath0 , lead to growth while those higher than the fragmentation velocity , @xmath1 , break apart if their mass ratio is smaller than the _ mass transfer _ parameter and stick if it is larger .",
    "physically this means that collisions between unequal - sized aggregates are likely to lead to growth while equal - sized aggregates are likely to fragment - a result shown by experiments ( e.g. @xcite ) and simulations ( @xcite ) . at all other velocities",
    "the aggregates bounce .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] shows that the final 3d pdf may cover any of these collisional outcomes - these are used to simulate the local size evolution of an ensemble of particles in a disc .",
    "we simulate grain growth locally in a disc with mass @xmath2 around a @xmath3 star ( see @xcite for parameters ) and find growth to larger sizes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tt ] , left ) . we also model growth in brown dwarf & t tauri discs where the latter is a scaled - up version of the former , i.e. the same disc to star mass ratio , simulated at the same location with respect to the truncation radius , @xmath4 , and where @xmath5 & @xmath4 are set using the observed relation @xmath6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we simulate growth at 10au in a brown dwarf disc with @xmath7 and @xmath8 around a @xmath9 brown dwarf , and at 60au in a t tauri disc with @xmath10 and @xmath11 around a @xmath12 star .",
    "[ fig : tt ] ( right ) shows that growth at the equivalent location in both discs occurs to the same size ( @xcite ) .",
    "we present a model for growth and fragmentation that considers a particle s velocity pdf and separates the deterministic and stochastic velocities .",
    "we find growth to large sizes and the emergence of two particle populations .",
    "in addition if brown dwarf discs are scaled - down versions of t tauri discs , growth occurs to similar sizes .",
    "our model may potentially explain the large ( @xmath13 mm - sized ) grains observed in brown dwarf discs ( e.g. @xcite ) and the long - standing problem of grain growth in discs : growing dust while maintaining a small - size population ."
