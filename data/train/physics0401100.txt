    "one of the distinctive features of the human brain is its aptitude for communicating thoughts by speaking . in spite of its relevance for exchanging information and emotions , it is very hard to deal with the system made by the auditory - phonatory apparatus by means of physical models .",
    "the emotional component of verbal communication relies on the fundamental sound of speech the laryngeal sound which is generated by the vocal cords without any movement of mouth or tongue .    the glottal sound has been studied for centuries in the framework of different disciplines , and numerous explanations for its unique capability of trasmitting emotions had been proposed . among these ideas ,",
    "one of the most captivating is jean - jacques rousseau theory about the relation between prosody and music @xcite . in his _ essai sur lorigine del languages , chapter xii _ , he writes : + _ `` la colre arrache des cris menaans , que la langue et le palais articulent : mais la voix de la tendresse est plus douce , cest la glotte qui la modifie , et cette voix devient un son ; seulement les accens en sont plus frquens ou plus rares , les inflexions plus ou moins aigus , selon le sentiment qui sy joint''_. + later , in the same book , he writes : + _ `` quon fasse la mme question sur la mlodie , la rponse vient delle - mme : elle est davance dans lesprit des lecteurs .",
    "la mlodie , en imitant les inflexions de la voix , exprime les plaintes , les cris de doleur ou de joie , les menaces , les gmissement ; tous les signes vocaux des passion sont de son ressort .",
    "elle imite les accens des langues , et les tours affects dans chaque idime  certains mouvemens de lame : elle nimite pas seulement , elle parle ; et son langage inarticul , mais vif , ardent , passionn a cent fois plus dnergie que la parole mme''_.    we want to study the relation suggested by rousseau between musical melodies and corresponding prosodic patterns , using a simple model for glottal motion .",
    "the laryngeal sound is generated by the cyclic motion of opening and the closing of vocal cords . at the beginning of the cycle air",
    "is pushed by the diaphragm , the vocal cords are drawn together and air pressure increase , but when the pressure reaches a critical value it blows the vocal cords apart and flows between them",
    ". then the vocal cords are then drawn together as a result of the bernoulli effect @xcite .    to understand this oscillating behavior `` without spring '' , we study a simple self - oscillating model for the pre - galileian clock @xcite which produces a realistic laryngeal tone . the model can laso be used as a powerful tool for the analysis of glottal sounds .",
    "the results of the analysis can be compared with some adiastematic notation to suggest a formal correspondence between prosody and music . in this direction",
    "it is possible to suggest that the prosody is the drift of the musical gusto evolution , to answer to the main question about the nature of stochastic processes which produce `` beautiful '' or at least meaningful sequences of sounds @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce a non - linear dynamical system which exhibit all the main features of the glottal cycle . in section 3",
    "the parameters of the system are used as time dependent controls for the glottis , and in the following we present an algorithm for analyzing the control of the recorded sounds .",
    "the form of this control suggest also a delay - line - like behavior for the cochlear apparatus .",
    "the laryngeal tone is the oscillatory variation in air pressure generated by the cyclic movement of the vocal cords . at the beginning of each cycle @xcite the vocal cords are held together by the action of the arytenoid cartilages .",
    "air is forced into the trachea and when the pressure exceeds a threshold ( the value of which depends on the strength of the vocal cords ) , it opens the vocal cords and flows through the glottis .",
    "inside the constricted laryngeal passage air pressure falls ( its velocity increase ) giving rise , for the bernoulli principle , to the pressure drop closing the vocal cords and completing the cycle .",
    "the cycle repeats at rates of 130 - 220 times per second .",
    "the ear perceives the variation in the cycle period as changes in the pitch .    the valve - like behavior producing the laryngeal tone is characteristic of self - oscillating systems .",
    "a self - oscillating system is an apparatus which _ produces a periodic process at the expense of a non - periodic source of energy_. self - oscillations do not depend on the initial condition but are determined by the properties of the system itself .",
    "examples of self - oscillating systems include the electric bell , saw - tooth signal generators as well as wind and string musical instruments @xcite .",
    "several realistic models for the glottal behavior have been proposed over the years starting with the celebrated `` two - mass model ''  @xcite .",
    "we will now present a minimal mechanism thet exibits all the main features of glottal behavior .",
    "in particular we want to make explicit both the dependence of the oscillation period on the forces acting on the system , and the features of the trigger mechanism producing the self - oscillations .",
    "let @xmath0 $ ] the variable related to the aperture of the glottis : in the extreme positions @xmath1 indicates that the glottis is completely closed and @xmath2 that the vocal cords are open .",
    "we represent @xmath3 in the @xmath4 $ ] interval in agreement with the usual representation of the acoustic signals .",
    "assuming that the laringeal tone is proportional to the opening , @xmath3 can be assimilated to the signal itself @xmath5\\ni t\\rightarrow s(t)\\in[-1,1]\\ ] ] where @xmath6 $ ] is a time interval . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the forces act on the glottis istantaneously : for @xmath7 the bernoulli effect produce a force which closes the glottis , for @xmath8 the pressure opens the glottis , and for @xmath9 no force is acting on the glottis .",
    "this approximation is useful for solving the model , but can be easily relaxed in computer simulations . when the glottis is opening , the force @xmath10 acting on it is negative and when it is closing @xmath11 .",
    "therefore over the interval @xmath12 the force @xmath13 is a twovalued function of the variable @xmath3 representing the opening of the glottis . following the andronov argument @xcite @xmath10 imposes limitations on the shape of the phase plane trajectories , since assigning @xmath14 does not uniquely determines the state of the system where @xmath15 .",
    "instead we have to use a phase surface with two half - planes superimposed : ( a ) @xmath16 and ( b ) @xmath17 .",
    "the points on this two - sheet phase surface have a one to one correspondence with the states of the system , the passage of the representative point from sheet ( a ) to the sheet ( b ) occurs for @xmath18 , the reverse passage for @xmath19 , and the abscissa remains unvaried in both the cases .    to further semplify the model we assume that the force @xmath10 applied to the glottis by the air pressure is constant in absolute value : @xmath20 for the closing and @xmath21 for the opening .",
    "to model the vocal cords tension we introduce the constant resistence @xmath22 , which does not depend on the position of the glottis . on the basis of these simple assumptions it is possible to describe two different laringeal sounds .",
    "the first one , that we call prosody , does not have a natural period because there is no elastic force contributing to the movement of the vocal cords .",
    "this system does not exhibit high stability and is therefore a good model for cases in which the period of oscillation has to be sensitive to variations in control parameters .",
    "the second type has a natural period due to the elastic term , and in absence of feeding can perform damped oscillations .",
    "this model can be used to describe singing , but is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "the dynamic equation for the model without the elastic force is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the glottis mass , @xmath13 the force produced by air pressure on it and @xmath25 is the resistence of the vocal cords . if we assume @xmath26 during the motion ( @xmath27 ) , equation ( [ moto ] ) becomes @xmath28 introducing the variables @xmath29 and @xmath30 , equation  ( [ esplic ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath31 where the dot operator is now the derivative with respect to the scaled time @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 is even when the glottis is closing and odd when the glottis is opening .",
    "if the air pressure outside the glottis is a linear funcion of the glottis aperture , the @xmath36 variable can be studied as the waveform of the laryngeal tone .",
    "if @xmath37 and the glottis is at rest ( @xmath38 ) the force produced by the air pressure can not open the vocal cords , @xmath39 and the point @xmath40 is the equilibrium state . therefore , for the case when @xmath41 the system has no states of equilibrium . from equation  ( [ due ] )",
    "we have for the ( a ) half plane ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) @xmath44 and integrating we have @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath48 , @xmath49 , so that the phase path on the sheet ( a ) is made by two parabolae and the representative point moves to the left on the lower half of the sheet ( @xmath46 ) and to the right on the upper one .",
    "all the phase paths on sheet ( a ) reach their boundaries on the semiaxis @xmath50 , @xmath48 , and the phase paths on sheet ( b ) are symmetrical with respect to the origin of the coordinates .",
    "following the andronov treatment @xcite we draw the two axes @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and consider the sequence of the points of intersections with them of an arbitrary phase path : @xmath57 .",
    "the representative point pass at the point @xmath58 from sheet ( b ) to sheet ( a ) and reach the axis of the abscissa at the point @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is given by the equation @xmath61 .",
    "then the representative point moves on the upper half of the sheet ( a ) and reaches its boundary at @xmath62 where @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 .",
    "the phase path on ( a ) establishes a one - to - one correspondence between the points of the axes @xmath51 and @xmath54 , a point transformation where the sequence function is parametrized by the peak @xmath60 of the laryngeal tone .",
    "then the representative point passes on the sheet ( b ) and reaches the semi - axis @xmath51 on @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is determined by the same sequence ( due to the symmetry of the sheets ( a ) and ( b ) ) and the point transformation of @xmath54 in @xmath51 is the same of @xmath51 in @xmath54 .",
    "the fixed point @xmath67 , corresponding to a symmetric limit cycle , is given by the equation @xmath68 and is determined by the glottal peak @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the lamerey s ladder given by the two curves @xmath71 and @xmath72 , tends to the fixed point if @xmath61 has a steeper slope than @xmath64 and the unique periodic motion is reached from any initial conditions .",
    "the period of the oscillation can be easily computed by the evaluation of the transit time on the parabolae arcs @xmath73 and depends on both the air pressure and the vocal cord resistence .    if we assume that the vocal cords resistence is not the same for the opening and closing glottis , the equation  ( [ due ] ) gives the signal of figure  [ figuraa ] .",
    "the corresponding sound is very similar to the sound obtained by placing a microphone on the throat and directly recording the glottal sound .",
    "the stability of equations  ( [ esplic ] ) can be evaluated by the ratios of the percentage variation of the period to the percentage variation of the two parameters , and shows to be very small @xcite . because of this low stability , the system is not suitable for building clocks .",
    "however its sensitivity to variation in the parameters and the fast convergence to the limit cycle , make it a suitable model for a controlled glottis .",
    "let us suppose that the air pressure and the strength of the vocal cords are controlled by the speaker .",
    "controlling @xmath74 and @xmath75 it is possible to change the amplitude ( [ ampiezza ] ) and the period ( [ periodo ] ) of the laryngeal tone to produce the prosodic patterns conveying the non semantic aspect of the speech .    in order to decode the prosodic pattern we neet to know the time evolution of the control function @xmath76 in other wordss we suggest that when the cochlea decode the prosody of the speech it needs only to detect the value of @xmath77 and the time delay of @xmath77 with respect to the previous one .",
    "this stands in agreement with recent studies about the delay lines inside the cochlea  @xcite .",
    "therefore the system can be controlled by a piecewise constant function which changes the period and the amplitude .",
    "if we choose a control function ( see figure  [ figurab ] ) we determine the time evolution of @xmath78 given by equation  ( [ esplic ] ) .",
    "the resulting phase path and waveform are plotted in figure  [ figurac ] .",
    "note that in this case the phase paths intersect because now the system is controlled and non - autonomous .",
    "we observe also that the characteristic time of the control change is larger than the period of the wave , in agreement with studies comparing of the laryngeal tone period with the muscular control time @xcite .",
    "therefore we state that the prosodic information is all contained in @xmath79 and that in order to decode the prosodic pattern the listener needs to decode the @xmath79 function .",
    "the dynamical system given by equation  ( [ due ] ) can be used to detect and represent the prosody of real speech . to accomplish this we only need to know the discrete function @xmath80\\ni t\\rightarrow \\bar\\xi(t)\\in[0,1]\\ ] ] even though the sound of ( [ picchi ] ) is different from the fundamental sound ( [ segnale ] ) ,",
    "their prosody is identical .",
    "moreover during the speech process the time interval between two consecutive @xmath77 is changed countinuously to produce the prosodic meaning .",
    "the @xmath81 function can be extracted from a recorded sound by means of the simple procedure of sliding a temporal fixed window on the signal , and selecting for each window the value of @xmath78 not exceeded backward and forward @xcite .",
    "the resulting signal is shown in figure  [ figurad ] on the left .    in order to obtain the control @xmath79 function",
    "we have to know the @xmath82 value also . to do this we plot the delay of each peak @xmath83 with respect to the previous one @xmath84 as funtion of time ( figure  [ figurad ] right ) where @xmath85 are the times where @xmath81 is non zero .    in this way it is possible to construct a map of the control @xmath79 and therefore to decode the prosody of the speech .",
    "the amplitude and the delay of @xmath77 are the only information needed .",
    "the control function represented in figure  [ figurab ] can be obtained by the data represented in figure  [ figurad ] via the equations  ( [ ampiezza ] ) and  ( [ periodo ] ) .",
    "if we take the fundamental given by the fast fourier transform of @xmath78 we obtain a rough map of @xmath79 because the fft needs some cycles to detect the period .    when applied to the real speech , the `` peak detection '' yelds maps which resemble the neumatic notation of the gregorian chant .",
    "this is not surprising given that during the middle age the rules of the correspondence between text and the music where very strict , and the composer had to put the known melodies together rather then inventing anything new ones @xcite . following the ideas of rousseau , the algorithm proposed for the analysis and the synthesis of the laringeal tone can be a tool for studying the correspondence between prosody and music by means of the comparison of the contol maps with the adiastematic notation system @xcite .",
    "although it is still not clear how the proposed system is related to the fluidodynamics of the glottis , the self - oscillating system used to model the laryngeal behavior is very simple and exhibits good agreement with the main features of the glottal sounds .",
    "it produces a realistic laryngeal sound an can be used to extract the prosody from a recorded sound .",
    "its main features , shared with many `` natural '' oscillators is the lacking of the elastic term .",
    "the control of this system suggests also that the cochlear behavior is related to delay line detection .",
    "the equation is very simple to simulate in real time on a computer , and can be used for generating prosodic patterns or for manipulating the prosodic meaning of recorded sentencces .",
