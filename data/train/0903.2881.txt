    "we focus on this question in the context of the @xmath0-(et)@xmath10 family of organic charge transfer salts , however , we also make some comments on ( tmtsf)@xmath1clo@xmath4 .",
    "an important difference between the cuprates and heavy fermion materials , and the @xmath0-(et)@xmath10 salts is that the @xmath0-phase organics there is a single half - filled band , whereas the other materials are multiband and/or doped .",
    "the mott transition in @xmath0-(et)@xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a monovalent anion , can be driven by applying a hydrostatic pressure or varying the anion , which is often referred to as chemical pressure .",

    "very little is known experimentally about this superconducting state .",
    "it has recently been argued@xcite that the frustration will drive changes in the spin fluctuations which will lead to a superconducting state with broken time reversal symmetry , i.e. , a @xmath18 ( or more strictly @xmath19 ) state .",
    "therefore it is important to understand the nature of the spin fluctuations in in both the insulating and the metallic phases .    in order to investigate the spin fluctuations we present , below , a theoretical analysis of previously published nmr experiments . in section [",
    "sect : hight ] we show that although nmr experiments on the organic charge transfer salts are rather similar to those on the cuprates and heavy fermion materials there are some important differences .",
    "a detailed analysis shows that , in the @xmath0-phase organics , the pseudogap energy scale is set by the spin fluctuations , while in ( tmtsf)@xmath1clo@xmath4 the superconducting gap is the same size as the characteristic spin fluctuations . in section [",
    "sect : coh ] we compare the pseudogap energy scale with the temperature at which coherence emerges in the intralayer transport .",
    "we find that they are the same to within experimental error and propose a phenomenological interpretation of this . in section [",
    "sect : highp ] we discuss the behaviour of the organic charge transfer salts under hydrostatic pressures and raise some important issues about the pseudogap that have not yet been addressed experimentally .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions in section [ sect : conc ] .",
    "in the two - fluid model proposed by pines _ et al_. @xcite the spin lattice relaxation rate is given by @xmath20 where @xmath0 and @xmath21 are material dependent constants , the latter measuring the proximity to a putative quantum critical point , and @xmath8 is the temperature where there is a maximum in @xmath7 .",
    "the two fluids are proposed to be a fermi liquid component and a spin liquid component .",
    "we plot previously published@xcite nmr data for both insulating and metallic phases of organic charge transfer salts in this ` scaling ' form in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] . for the metallic salts",
    "it can be seen that , while there is a broad trend in the data , the data do not collapse onto a single curve as they do in the cuprates and the heavy fermion materials.@xcite this suggests that two fluid model may not be relevant to the organic charge transfer salts , but also that there is something to be learnt from fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] . for the insulating states",
    "the spin lattice relaxation is very different for those compounds that order magnetically ( and fully dueterated \\{henceforth } ) from that in the spin liquid .",
    "indeed the data for is remarkably similar to the data for the metallic salts .",
    "important evidence that a two - fluid model is required in the heavy fermion materials comes from comparing the knight shift , @xmath22 , to the bulk susceptibility @xmath23 . according to the two fluid model @xmath24\\chi_{sl } , \\label{eqn:2f - chi}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the fraction of electrons in the fermi liquid",
    ", @xmath26 is the susceptibility of the fermi liquid , which is basically independent of temperature , and @xmath27 is the susceptibility of the spin liquid .",
    "further , the two - fluid model predicts that @xmath28\\chi_{sl } , \\label{eqn:2f - ks}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the hyperfine coupling constant between the itinerant electrons and the probe nuclei and @xmath30 is hyperfine coupling of the spin liquid to the nuclei .",
    "hence , if @xmath31 then @xmath22 will not be proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "systematic differences between temperature dependence of @xmath22 and that of @xmath23 are indeed found in the heavy fermion materials.@xcite in the high temperature ( @xmath32 ) regime @xmath33 in ( refs . ) , ( ref . ) or ( ref . ) .",
    "we are not aware of any reports of @xmath22 in either or , or data for @xmath22 at high temperatures in ( tmtsf)@xmath1clo@xmath4 . there is only a single band that plays an important role in the organics , so one might reasonably argue that @xmath34 .",
    "nevertheless the comparison of @xmath22 and @xmath23 does not force one to consider a two fluid model and we now move on to discuss another possible explanation of the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] .      moriyas@xcite theory of spin fluctuations in nearly antiferromagnetic metals , particularly in the phenomenological form pioneered by millis , monien , and pines,@xcite has been shown to give good agreement with nmr experiments in the cuprates,@xcite heavy fermion materials,@xcite and the organics.@xcite therefore , it is natural to ask whether this can explain the similarities between the rescaled data for the various materials in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] .",
    "the simplest assumption@xcite for the temperature dependence of the spin correlation length is @xmath35 . here",
    "the temperature dependence of the spin fluctuations is controlled by a single parameter , @xmath36 , thus one finds@xcite that , in the limit of strong spin fluctuations , @xmath37 where @xmath38 ^ 2 $ ] , @xmath39 is the lattice spacing , and @xmath40 is a material specific constant . for @xmath41 ,",
    "i.e. , if the magnetic correlation length is large and the temperature is low , one can ` rescale ' this to @xmath42 so that material specific part cancels and we find that @xmath43 thus the spin fluctuation model predicts that , for nearly antiferromagnetic metals , @xmath44 is linear in @xmath45 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the data for the metallic materials in fig [ fig : scaling]a .",
    "further , the spin fluctuation theory for a nearly antiferromagnetic metal constrains the gradient of the data to lie between 0 ( @xmath46 , for a material with neither a pseudogap nor superconductivity ) and 1 ( @xmath47 , for material with no spin fluctuations ) , cf .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) .",
    "indeed , we find that @xmath48 for all of the metallic organic charge transfer salts .",
    "this last result is an important conclusion , as it suggests that the pseudogap energy scale is set by that of the spin fluctuations .",
    "note that in ( tmtsf)@xmath1clo@xmath4 the maximum in the @xmath7 occurs at the superconducting critical temperature , i.e. , @xmath49 .",
    "this suggests that spin fluctuations may determine the superconducting critical temperature and thus the spin fluctuations may mediate the superconductivity in ( tmtsf)@xmath1clo@xmath4 .",
    "this is consistent with the unconventional superconducting state observed in this material.@xcite    for materials that order antiferromagnetically , one expects , within mean field theory ( whence the correlation length critical exponent @xmath50 ) , that @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the nel temperature .",
    "thus @xmath53 where @xmath54 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath39 is the lattice spacing .",
    "rescaling we find that , @xmath55 note that the maximum in @xmath7 does not occur at @xmath52 due to short range correlations .",
    "rather , @xmath7 has a infinite tangent at @xmath52 , as does the bulk susceptibility.@xcite therefore on very general grounds@xcite one expects @xmath56 . a sharp decline in @xmath7 below @xmath8",
    "is observed in the data for ( ref . ) and ( ref . ) , consistent with these expectations .",
    "thus eq . ( [ scalingafm ] ) provides an excellent description of the data for and ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling]b ) .",
    "note in particular that eq .",
    "( [ scalingafm ] ) , correctly , predicts a steep gradient and a negative intercept in agreement with the data , and in contrast to eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) and the data for the non - magnetic salts .",
    "the rescaled nmr relaxation rate in metallic ( data at 0.35 and 0.4  gpa ) are remarkable similar to those in and which are much more weakly frustrated .",
    "this can be understood because @xmath57 depends only the the integral over the brillouin zone of the dynamic susceptibility .",
    "the spin fluctuation theory , which gives a good description of all of the data , only assumes that the dynamic susceptibility has a peak _ somewhere _ in the brillouin zone and that the peak is away from the origin .",
    "the predicted scaled @xmath58 is independent of the location of the peak .",
    "thus this data does not indicate which @xmath59 has the strongest magnetic fluctuations , but does show that the magnetic fluctuations are just as strong in metallic as they are in the more weakly frustrated @xmath0-(et)@xmath10 salts .",
    "the rescaled nmr relaxation rate in insulating ( data at 0 and 0.3  gpa ) is very different from that in the insulating phases of and .",
    "instead the data for the insulating phase of is well described by eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) , which describes the data in the metallic materials considered above .",
    "thus it appears that the central difference between the scaled nmr relaxation rates is not whether the material is insulating or metallic but whether the material orders magnetically or not .",
    "we note that both data sets fit remarkably well to the prediction of eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) for @xmath60 in the insulating phases of .",
    "this brings to mind the weak coupling bcs form formula for the pairing temperature in a superconductor .",
    "however , at this stage we have no evidence that this is any more than a numerical coincidence .",
    "we now turn our attention to how the pseudogap energy scale , @xmath61 , is related to the other energy scales in the @xmath0-phase organic charge transfer salts . fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] shows that , for the weakly frustrated salts \\ { , , and } @xmath61 coincides with the temperature below which the resistivity varies quadratically , @xmath62 , and the temperature at which a broad , deep minimum is observed in the ultrasonic velocity , @xmath63 .",
    "further , when these quantities are plotted against the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath64 , all three materials show the same trend .",
    "[ fig : phase ] represents a significant quantitative success for the chemical pressure hypothesis , which holds that the major effect of changing the anions is to alter size of the unit cell and therefore control the strength of the electronic correlations and which underpins a great deal of the thinking on the organic charge transfer salts .",
    "however , the chemical pressure hypothesis clearly fails for , which does not share the same scaling of temperature scales as the other salts investigated .",
    "further , @xmath8 is clearly rather different from @xmath65 in .",
    "this suggests that the metallic state of is rather different from the metallic states of the more weakly frustrated @xmath0-phase organic charge transfer salts , consistent with the idea that the spin fluctuations in this material differ from those in its less frustrated cousins in important ways.@xcite nevertheless the observation of a quadratic temperature dependence of the resistivity at temperatures slightly above @xmath9 shows that charge transport is coherent in the metallic state of under pressure .",
    "the observation that the crossover to a quadratic temperature dependence of the resistivity approximately coincides with the minimum in the ultrasonic attenuation has been understood@xcite in terms of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "dmft predicts a crossover from a fermi liquid at low temperatures to a ` bad metal ' ( characterised by the absence of quasiparticles and the drude peak , and a resistivity that exceeds the mott - ioffe - regal limit ) as the temperature is increased above a coherence temperature , @xmath66 .",
    "thus it is believed that @xmath67 . however , while dmft gives an adequate description of the nuclear spin relaxation rate above @xmath68 , below @xmath69 dmft predicts a fermi liquid and thus a constant @xmath7 ; this is clearly _ not _ what is observed.@xcite this shows that dmft does not capture all of the relevant physics below @xmath69.@xcite it is also interesting to note that dmft does describe the observed behaviour of probes of charge degrees of freedom , such as the resistivity , and only fails for probes of the spin degrees of freedom , such as @xmath7 .",
    "as dmft is a purely local theory a reasonable hypothesis it that the relevant physics , not described by dmft , involves short - range spin correlations .",
    "further , the enhanced korringa ratios observed@xcite at temperatures slightly above @xmath9 suggest that antiferromagnetic correlations remain important at in the coherent transport regime.@xcite    the spin degrees of freedom in the pseudogap regime of the @xmath0-phase organics behave in much the same way as the spin degrees of freedom in the pseudogap regime of the underdoped cuprates",
    ". there has been significant debate as to whether , and if so how , the pseudogap in the cuprates is related to the other exotic phenomena seen in the normal state , such as the linear temperature dependence of the resistivity . in this context",
    "it is interesting to note that in the region of the phase diagram of the organics where the pseudogap is found , the resistivity varies quadratically with temperature@xcite and the magnitude of the coefficient of the quadratic term in the resistivity is as expected from fermi liquid theory given the observed effective mass.@xcite further , clear evidence of quasiparticles is seen via quantum oscillation experiments.@xcite therefore , in , , and the loss of spectral weight in the pseudogap is not associated with non - fermi  liquid behaviour .",
    "an important difference between the cuprates and the organics is that the organics are half filled whereas the cuprates are more strongly correlated , doped systems . in this context",
    "it is worth noting that a linear resistivity has recently been reported in an organic charge transfer salt with an anion layer that has a lattice constant that is incommensurate with the lattice constant of the organic layer.@xcite the authors argued that this non - stoichiometric organic charge transfer salt is effectively doped away from half filling .",
    "an important question in understanding the phenomenology of the @xmath0-(et)@xmath10 salts is : do the two energy scales , @xmath69 and @xmath8 remain equal as pressure is increased and we move further from the mott transition ? this question is difficult to answer at present because there is little experimental data for high pressures ( including high chemical pressure , i.e. , materials with low @xmath9 s )",
    ". there is however tantalising evidence that something rather interesting happens to the superconducting state at high pressures.@xcite in particular while the materials near the mott transition have a superfluid stiffness , @xmath70 , within a factor of two or so of the prediction of bcs theory , at high pressures the superfluid penetration depth , @xmath71 , increases as @xmath72 ( ref . ) . with some materials having superfluid stiffnesses ( @xmath73 ) that are an order of magnitude smaller than the prediction of bcs theory.@xcite    we are only aware of one nmr experiment at high pressures in these materials . ref .",
    "reports data for at 3 kbar ( which leads to @xmath74 k)@xcite and 4 kbar ( @xmath75 k ) . at these pressures strong spin fluctuations",
    "are not observed , and the @xmath7 looks quite conventional . yet for the 3 kbar data there is small but noticeable decrease in @xmath7 below @xmath76 k. is this the last vestige of the pseudogap ?",
    "if so , it suggests that at high pressures the pseudogap and the coherent intralayer transport energy scales are different .",
    "either way more experiments are clearly required to understand where the pseudogap vanishes .    on the basis of the above discussion we propose that a number of new features should be included in the phase diagram of these materials , which we sketch in fig .",
    "[ fig : new_phase ] . we stress that this phase diagram is relevant to the weakly frustrated materials for which the chemical pressure hypothesis holds , and therefore does not include which would necessitate an additional axis to include the effects of frustration .",
    "we have included the nernst region where nam _",
    "et al_. @xcite have observed a large nernst effect above @xmath9 in at ambient pressure , which they find to be absent in at ambient pressure .",
    "note that we have drawn the @xmath8 and the @xmath9 lines both supressed to zero at the same pressure .",
    "this is deliberately provocative .",
    "as we have stressed above there is insufficient experimental data to determine the relative order in which the superconductivity and the pseudogap disappear as pressure is increased .",
    "the issue of where the superconductivity and pseudogap vanish is related to an ongoing debate in the cuprates .",
    "a recent review of a wide range of experimental data in a wide variety of cuprates suggested that the pseudogap and superconductivity both vanish at the same critical doping.@xcite similarly , more detailed experimental and theoretical studies of the organics in the vicinity of the pressure above which superconductivity vanishes might give important insights into how the pseudogap is related to superconductivity .",
    "the possibility of a quantum critical point somewhere in the vicinity of the pressure where the superconducting critical temperature goes to zero may have important consequences for the observation that the materials with the lowest superconducting critical temperatures have extremely small superfluid stiffnesses and are very different from bcs superconductors.@xcite    finally , we sketch an explanation of the observed phase diagram ( fig . [ fig : new_phase ] ) .",
    "we have noted above that dmft describes the competition between the insulating , bad metal , and fermi liquid phases.@xcite but , dmft fails to predict either the pseudogap or the unconventional superconductivity , which suggests that these effects involve non - local physics .",
    "however , it has recently been argued that the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) theory can describe the superconducting state of the quasi - two - dimensional organic charge transfer salts,@xcite this theory also predicts a pseudogap with the approximately the right energy scale .",
    "therefore , we propose that dmft captures the crossover from incoherent to coherent charge transport , but is insufficient to describe the behaviour in the coherent regime because short - range spin correlations play a significant role here .",
    "the simplest theory that can capture the low temperature physics of is the rvb theory .",
    "however , the rvb theory does not capture the loss of coherence as the temperature is raised , which we argue leads to a cut off of the pseudogap phenomena . if this speculation is correct",
    ", the challenge is then to produce a single theory capable of describing all of the physics , including the large nernst effect above @xmath9 in ( ref . ) , which neither the dmft nor the rvb theory predicts . therefore cellular dmft calculations , which can describe both short - range spin fluctuations and the loss of intralayer coherence , may have an important role to play in understanding the organic superconductors .",
    "we have argued that a two - fluid description is not required for the organic charge transfer salts .",
    "it is interesting to speculate why this is .",
    "one possibility is that the difference between the organic salts discussed above and many other strongly correlated superconductors is that the organics are stoichiometric , while , for example , the metallic cuprates are doped systems and the heavy fermions show a subtle hybridisation between almost localised states and conduction electrons",
    ". therefore it would be interesting to measure the nuclear relaxation rate in the recently discovered non - stoichometric organic superconductors .",
    "we have seen that there are strong similarities in the rescaled spin lattice relaxation across the non - magnetic organic charge transfer salts .",
    "these similarities can be understood in terms of spin fluctuations .",
    "further , our analysis suggests that the energy scale for the spin fluctuations may set the energy scale for the pseudogap in the organic charge transfer salts .    in the weakly frustrated metals [ all the metals studied bar ] the pseudogap opens at the same temperature as",
    "coherence emerges in the ( intralayer ) transport .",
    "we argued that this is because spin correlations , which are responsible for the pseudogap , are cut off by the loss of intralayer coherence at high temperatures . in these weakly frustrated materials",
    "the data can be compared across materials quite reliably , consistent with the chemical pressure hypothesis .",
    "in contrast the metallic state of , which is highly frustrated , was shown to be rather different from those of the other materials .",
    "finally , we have also shown that in ( tmtsf)@xmath1clo@xmath4 the characteristic temperature scale of the spin fluctuations is the same as @xmath9 .",
