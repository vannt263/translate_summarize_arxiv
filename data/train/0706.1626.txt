    "recent analyses of meteorites confirmed the presence of fe isotopes of supernova origin in the early solar nebula and suggested that the solar system was formed in a massive star forming region @xcite .",

    "the m16 region is important as it is a site with such an environment .",
    "the eagle nebula ( m16 ) is one of the most noticeable star forming regions following a comprehensive study of the three molecular gas pillars ( pillars 1  3 ) with hst @xcite .",
    "near - infrared studies revealed that the protostar - like or very young objects m16es-1 and m16es-2 @xcite , which were also identified as p1 and t1 by @xcite and as yso-1 and yso-2 by @xcite , are located at the tips of pillars 1 and 2 , respectively , facing toward the main exciting star of m16 .",
    "@xcite reported that the locations of these young stellar objects and the elongated structures of the pillars suggested their formation as being due to the interaction with uv light from the ob stars in the ngc 6611 cluster , in analogy with the sequential star formation in some bright - rimmed clouds @xcite .",
    "@xcite used interferometric observations of @xmath3co and c@xmath4o ( @xmath5 , and of 2.7 mm continuum to indicate the propagation of star formation activity in the heads of these two pillars due to radiation or wind from the main exciting star .",
    "@xcite stated that the water masers in m16 were concentrated in the compressed gas layers within a few tenths of a parsec of the ionization front in three molecular pillars , one of which is pillar 2 , suggesting triggered star formation in their tip regions .",
    "@xcite also discussed the sequential nature of star formation in the pillars . for pillar 3",
    ", @xcite implied that the bright stars m16s-1 and m16s-2 , which are located at the tip , were the results of recent star formation at the pillar head .",
    "@xcite estimated the luminosity of m16es-1 and m16es-2 to be 200 @xmath6 and 20 @xmath6 , respectively , as a single object or a cluster of objects .",
    "they suggested that m16es-1 is not a source of ionization radiation based on the absence of pa@xmath7 emission , and that it is either made up of multiple lower - luminosity objects or an object(s ) in the earlier stage of zams , i.e. , protostar stage . on the other hand , @xcite estimated the extinction of m16es-1 and m16es-2 to be 27 and 15 mag .",
    ", respectively , assuming their @xmath8 and @xmath9 fluxes to be photospheric , and concluded that a 10 @xmath10 zams star and 2.5 @xmath10 zams star were located at the tips of pillars 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "it is not clear , from these observations , whether single stars of relatively high masses or multiple lower - mass stars have formed there .",
    "thus , further observations are required to address this issue .",
    "recently , @xcite developed 3-d hydrodynamical model for the dynamical evolution of molecular clouds irradiated by uv light from massive stars , i.e. , bright - rimmed clouds .",
    "they noted that since their model adequately included self - gravity and treated the chemical and thermal evolution , it had advantage in the detailed study of triggered star formation over previous 2-d/3-d models that did not fully include all of these effects ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although these models successfully reproduced some of the observed properties of bright - rimmed clouds .",
    "@xcite applied their model for pillar 2 and suggested that the core of pillar 2 is at a transition stage toward induced star formation due to the shock that precedes an ionization front moving toward the core .",
    "in fact , a water - maser source , which indicates an object in the very early stage of stellar evolution , is detected near the core of pillar 2 @xcite a few arc - seconds inside of m16es-2 , which is located at the ionization front @xcite , suggesting further induced star formation in pillar 2 .",
    "however , these models do not predict magnetic field behavior in detail , although @xcite did include magnetic pressure and @xcite used an approximate expression for the magnetic flux .",
    "the lack of a full treatment of magnetic fields is due to the modeling complexity and to the paucity of observations of magnetic fields in and around molecular clouds associated with hii regions .",
    "@xcite presented polarimetric @xmath11 observation data of ngc 6611 , including those of @xcite .",
    "they identified the presence of nearby dust clouds located on the local arm that have slightly a larger mean @xmath12 than that of the average interstellar medium .",
    "the mean position angle of the e - vectors was estimate to be @xmath13 .",
    "however , these optical observations will only be relevant for stars with small extinction and hence will not provide information on the magnetic field deep within molecular clouds .",
    "thus , infrared polarimetric observations are important .",
    "we conducted deep , near - ir polarimetric observations in m16 to reveal the details of m16es-1/2 and to obtain magnetic field structures in this region .",
    "we also aimed to search for more near - ir reflection nebula sources in this region . here",
    "we present the results of our observations and discuss the details of m16es-1/2 and the magnetic field behavior in this region . the polarimetry instrument used in this study is sirpol , which is the attachment of the sirius camera mounted on the 1.4-m irsf telescope at the south africa astronomical observatory ( saao ) .",
    "its distinctive feature is presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in the southern region of m16 ( figure [ fig1 ] ) , simultaneous @xmath2 polarimetric observations were carried out using the sirius camera and its attachment polarimeter mounted on the 1.4-m irsf telescope at saao .",
    "the sirius camera is equipped with three 1024 @xmath1 1024 hgcdte ( hawaii ) arrays , @xmath2 filters , and dichroic mirrors , which enable simultaneous @xmath2 imaging .",
    "the field of view at each band is @xmath077 @xmath1 77 , with a pixel size of 045 .",
    "the polarimeter is composed of an achromatic ( 0.52.5 ) wave - plate rotator unit and a high - extinction - ratio polarizer , both of which are attached upstream of the camera and at room temperature .",
    "details of the sirius camera are presented in @xcite and @xcite , and those of the polarimeter in @xcite .",
    "the total exposure time was 900 s per wave - plate angle .",
    "we obtained 10 dithered exposures , each 10 s long , at 4 wave - plate angles ( 0@xmath14 , 22.5@xmath14 , 45@xmath14 , and 67.5@xmath14 ) as one set of observation .",
    "we repeated this set 9 times .",
    "sky images were also obtained in between target observations .",
    "the seeing during the observations was 11 ( 2.5 pixel ) in the @xmath15 band .",
    "after the standard procedures for near - ir image reduction with iraf ( dark subtraction , flat - fielding with twilight - flats , bad - pixel substitution , sky subtraction , and averaging of dithered images ) , we evaluated the stokes parameters ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , the degree of polarization @xmath19 , and the polarization angle @xmath20 as follows ; @xmath21 and @xmath22 . the absolute accuracy of position angle of polarization was estimated to be better than 3@xmath23 based on the measurements during the commissioning run . the polarization efficiency at @xmath2 were also estimated to be higher than 96% and ,",
    "therefore , no correction of @xmath19 was made here .",
    "aperture polarimetry was performed for point sources detected by daofind in the field of view .",
    "the daophot package was used to evaluate the point source magnitudes for 4 wave - plate angles at @xmath9 and @xmath15 .",
    "the limiting magnitudes ( at 0.1 mag error level ) of each wave - plate angle are estimated to be 18.0 and 17.0 at @xmath9 , and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the 2mass data were used for magnitude calibration .",
    "all the sources with photometric errors of @xmath24 0.1 mag were rejected .",
    "the errors of the degree of polarization and position angle were calculated from the photometric errors , and the degrees of polarization were debiased @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 intensities are shown as a composite color image in figure [ fig1 ] . in the central region of this image ,",
    "the famous elephant trunks ( pillars 13 ) are identified as areas of lower stellar density , together with a molecular cloud that is at the base of the pillars ( near hh 216 ) . toward the south - east region of the image ,",
    "pillar 4 and its neighboring molecular clouds @xcite are also identified .",
    "relatively strong extended nebular emission is seen around pillars 13 , and there is rim - brightening emission of the molecular cloud edges ( pillars 14 , and a cloud near hh 216 ) facing the exciting stars that are located to the north - west , but out of this image .",
    "the rim - brightening emission seems to be reflection from the ob star light and/or from hii gas at the surfaces of the molecular clouds .",
    "the @xmath2 polarized intensities ( @xmath25 ) are presented as a composite color image in figure [ fig2 ] , where @xmath25 is the product of @xmath19 and @xmath16 .",
    "distinctive polarization emission nebulae are only identified toward the two ysos m16es-1 and m16es-2 .",
    "this suggests that most of the extended nebula emission and rim - brightening emission are not reflected light from the ob stars , but comes from hii gas continuum / line emission .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure2.eps        a polarization vector map toward m16es-1 of pillar 1 is shown superimposed both on the @xmath16 and @xmath25 images at each band in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the appearance of the nebulae in the @xmath25 image is significantly different from that in the @xmath16 image at each band .",
    "the polarized nebula emission is seen mostly around m16es-1 , while the nebula emission of the @xmath16 image is seen both around m16es-1 and at the rim region facing toward the exciting stars of m16 . however , the polarization vector maps indicate weak polarized emission in the rim region , although it is not clearly recognized in the @xmath25 images .    strong polarized emission is asymmetrically distributed just north and south of m16es-1 in the @xmath15 and @xmath9 bands , while point - like weak polarized emission is seen immediately north of m16es-1 in the @xmath26 band .",
    "the polarization vectors of the asymmetric emission clearly show a centrosymmetric pattern that is probably due to the illumination of m16es-1 , in the @xmath15 and @xmath9 bands , although this pattern is not clearly seen in the @xmath26 band .",
    "these suggest that the polarized emission comes from the walls of two ( north and south ) cavity lobes , which were created by the bipolar outflow from m16es-1 and are still embedded in the molecular gas .",
    "the north lobe has two ( nw and nne ) sub - peaks / features and the south one also has two ( se and ssw ) features in the @xmath25 images of @xmath15 and @xmath9 .",
    "the degrees of polarization of the south lobe are 20% or more , somewhat higher than those of the north lobe whereas the intensities are higher in the north lobe than in the south one .",
    "it is possible that these four sub - peaks / features are bright regions within a single bipolar cavity lobe , although it is difficult to eliminate the possibility that the outflow system consists of two pairs of bipolar outflows . in the latter case",
    ", the nw and nne features would be counterparts of the se and ssw features , respectively , suggesting either a binary star system or the precession of a single bipolar outflow .",
    "@xcite point out the possibility that m16es-1 consists of multiple low luminosity objects and our results would appear to support this . however , the nw and nne features might be coincident with the two 2.7 mm continuum peaks y and x of @xcite , respectively .",
    "if they are , then this would indicate that the feature are either free - free emission from ultra - compact hii regions , i.e. , high - mass protostar hypothesis @xcite , or that they are dust emission from very dense regions @xcite , which are located on top of the cavity with surfaces that strongly reflect the light from m16es-1 .",
    "the polarization vectors toward these two features seem to support the latter possibility .",
    "the h@xmath27 image of @xcite shows some emission corresponding to the nw and nne features , which also supports the idea that the two 2.7 mm continuum peaks are dust emission , indicating dense cores that have enough masses to form low - mass stars .",
    "higher resolution observations both at radio and infrared wavelengths , however , are required to reveal the detailed structures around m16es-1 .",
    "a gap is clearly seen between the nw and se features ( around the center of the centrosymmetric vector pattern ) in the @xmath25 images of the @xmath15 and @xmath9 bands .",
    "this is due to the very - low degree of polarization toward the gap region , since the intensities at the @xmath15 and @xmath9 bands are very high there .",
    "this gap most likely corresponds to a small disk - like structure @xcite , perpendicular to the axis of the cavity lobe(s ) , although the usual `` polarization disk '' ( parallel polarization pattern ; e.g. , @xcite ) is not evident .",
    "this is most likely due to the modest spatial resolution of the observations , with a range of polarization position angles from the reflection nebulae producing a very small degree of polarization .",
    "if this is the case , a disk - like structure with a size of several thousand au is expected @xcite . here",
    "the disk would appear to be tilted so that the north side is near to us , producing the higher polarized intensity of the north lobe and the higher degree of polarization of the south lobe .",
    "weak polarized emission is seen along the rim region in the polarization vector maps of the @xmath9 and @xmath26 bands , and the polarization vectors are nearly perpendicular to the direction of the exciting star(s ) from the tip of pillar 1 .",
    "thus , this polarized emission along the rim region is most likely to be reflected light from the ob stars of m16 , but significantly weaker than that occurs in m42 @xcite .",
    "the degree of polarization is slightly higher at the @xmath26 band than at the @xmath9 band , and no alignment of the polarized vectors is recognized at the @xmath15 band .",
    "these may be due to dilution by line emission ( e.g. , h@xmath28 , br@xmath29 ) from hii gas at longer wavelengths .",

    "the polarized emission is clearly more constricted to the east and west of the approximate center of the centrosymmetric pattern .",
    "similar trends are also seen at @xmath26 and @xmath15 . these , together with the larger total and polarized intensities to the north , but larger degrees of polarization to the south ( except in the outermost regions ) are all consistent with a disk - like structure with a size of a few thousand au , which is significantly tilted so that the north side is near to us .",
    "@xcite reported a dark lane in the middle of the m16es-2 nebulosity , suggestive of an associated disk - like structure , and @xcite also suggested that the surrounding nebulosity of m16es-2 is double .",

    "the nicmos nebula peak is not located at the center of the centrosymmetric pattern or the constriction , but within the north nebula ( figure [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) .",

    "<S> the polarization intensity map reveals that two ysos with near - ir reflection nebulae are located at the tips of two famous molecular pillars ( pillars 1 and 2 ) facing toward the exciting stars of m16 . </S>",
    "<S> the centrosymmetric polarization pattern are consistent with those around class i objects having circumstellar envelopes , confirming that star formation is now taking place at the two tips of the pillars under the influence of uv radiation from the exciting stars . </S>",
    "<S> polarization measurements of point sources show that magnetic fields are aligned along some of the pillars but in a direction that is quite different to the global structure in m16 . </S>"
