    "iron - based superconductors have generated a great deal of interests due to exotic physical and chemical properties such as high transition temperature @xmath6 ( above 50 k ) in layered structure without copper oxygen planes , spin fluctuation spectrum dominated by two dimensional incommensurate excitations comparable to high-@xmath7 cuprates and multiorbital physics with active spin , charge and orbital degrees of freedom.@xcite@xmath8@xcite simple binary fese@xmath9 , fe(te@xmath10se@xmath9)@xmath11 , and fe@xmath12(te@xmath10s@xmath9)@xmath11@xcite@xmath8@xcite share common characteristics with other iron - based superconductors : a square - planar lattice of fe with tetrahedral coordination and similar fermi surface topology.@xcite on the other hand they exhibit some distinctive features such as the absence of charge reservoir , significant pressure effect@xcite and strongly magnetic excess fe in fe(2 ) site providing local moments that are expected to persist even if the antiferromagnetic order is suppressed by doping or pressure.@xcite furthermore , superconductivity in fe@xmath12(te@xmath10s@xmath9)@xmath11 develops from nonmetallic conductivity which is different from metallic resistivity above t@xmath13 in all other iron based superconductors.@xcite@xmath14@xcite    there are two remarkable common characteristics in @xmath15-@xmath16 phase diagram of iron - based superconductors . in ternary and quaternary iron pnictide superconductors ( 122 and 1111 systems )",
    "@xmath17 shows pronounced upturn or positive temperature curvature far below @xmath6 without saturation .",
    "in contrast , @xmath18 exhibits a downturn curvature with decreasing temperature.@xcite@xmath14@xcite  the former can be explained by two band theory with high ( 1111 ) or low ( 122 systems ) intraband diffusivity ratio of electron band to hole band and the latter is commonly ascribed to the spin - paramagnetic effect.jaroszynski@xmath8@xcite    here we report comprehensive study of the upper critical field anisotropy and magnetotransport properties of fe@xmath0(te@xmath1s@xmath2)@xmath11 single crystals in stable magnetic fields up to 35 t. we observe that enhanced spin - paramagnetic effect is dominant in both @xmath19 and @xmath18 .",
    "we conclude that the root cause of that enhancement and the anomalous normal state electronic transport properties is the existence of excess fe(2 ) iron .",
    "as opposed to 122 and 1111 iron pnictide superconductors derived from stoichiometric ba(sr)fe@xmath20as@xmath20 and laofeas parent compounds , the width of material formation and subtle iron stoichiometry is rather important in superconductors derived from fe@xmath12te .",
    "single crystals of fe(te , s ) were grown by self flux method and their crystal structure was analyzed in the previous report.@xcite the elemental and microstructure analysis on particular crystal used in this study showed fe@xmath0(te@xmath1s@xmath2)@xmath11 stoichiometry and will be denoted as s-09 in the following for brevity .",
    "electrical transport measurements were performed using a four - probe configuration with current flowing in the ab - plane of tetragonal structure in dc magnetic fields up to 9 t in a quantum design ppms-9 from 1.8 to 200 k and up to 35 t in an oxford heliox cryostat with resistive magnet down to 0.3 k at the national high magnetic field laboratory ( nhmfl ) in tallahassee , fl .",
    "1(a , b ) shows the temperature dependent ab - plane electrical resistivity @xmath21 of s-09 below 15 k in magnetic fields from 0 to 9 t for h@xmath22ab and h@xmath22c . with increasing magnetic fields ,",
    "the resistivity transition widths are slightly broader . the onset of superconductivity shifts to lower temperatures gradually for both magnetic field directions , but the trend is more obvious for h@xmath22c than h@xmath22ab .",
    "the shape and broadening of @xmath21 for h@xmath22c is comparable to 122-system,@xcite but quite different from 1111-system@xcite where it was explained by the vortex - liquid state similar to cuprates.@xcite@xmath8@xcite hence , it can be concluded that the vortex - liquid state region is narrower or even absent in s-09 .",
    "this is similar to fe@xmath12(te@xmath10se@xmath9)@xmath11.@xcite    ( @xmath16 ) of s-09 at fixed fields ( 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 t ) for h@xmath22ab plane and h@xmath22c axis below 15 k , respectively .",

    "( c ) temperature dependence of @xmath25 at high magnetic fields from 15 to 35 t ( 15 , 20 and 35 t ) . ]    the upper critical field @xmath3 corresponding to temperatures where the resistivity drops to 90% , 50% and 10% of the normal state resistivity @xmath26 is shown in fig . 1(c ) .",
    "the normal - state resistivity @xmath27 was determined by linearly extrapolating the normal - state behavior above the onset of superconductivity in @xmath21 curves ( same as for @xmath28 curves ) .",
    "the slope of @xmath29 obtained from linear fitting the curves of @xmath30 near @xmath6 for all defined temperatures are listed in table 1 .",
    "the values of orbital pair breaking field @xmath31 corresponding to the conventional one - band werthamer - helfand - hohenberg ( whh ) theory@xcite @xmath31=-0.693@xmath32 are also listed in table 1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tablekey copy(1 ) ]    temperature dependence of anisotropy of @xmath3 , @xmath33=@xmath34 , is shown in fig .",
    "3(d ) as a function of temperature @xmath16 .",
    "the value of @xmath35 for s-09 is smaller than that of fe@xmath12(te@xmath10se@xmath9)@xmath11 at high temperature@xcite@xmath14fang mh and it decreases gradually to 1 with decreasing temperature .",
    "values of @xmath35 decrease to less than 1 below @xmath16=1 k , which has also been observed in fe@xmath12(te@xmath36se@xmath37)@xmath11.@xcite@xmath14@xcite    why are there large maki parameter @xmath38 and non - zero @xmath39 ?",
    "first , the maki parameter can be enhanced due to disorder.@xcite@xmath14@xcite in this system , disorder can be induced by te(s ) substitution / vacancies and excess fe in fe(2 ) site , resulting in the enhancement of spin - paramagnetic effect .",
    "second , according to the expression of @xmath40 with strong coupling correction considering electron - boson and electron - electron interaction:@xcite@xmath14orlando@xmath14@xcite @xmath40=@xmath41 , where @xmath42 describes the strong coupling intraband correction for the gap , @xmath43 is the stoner factor @xmath43=@xmath44 , @xmath45 is the electronic density of states ( dos ) per spin at the fermi energy level @xmath46 , @xmath47 is an effective exchange integral , @xmath48 is introduced to describe phenomenologically the effect of the gap anisotropy , @xmath49 is electron - boson coupling constant and @xmath50=0.5 or 1 .",
    "since the @xmath45 of fes is larger than that of fese,@xcite it is likely that the @xmath45 of fe@xmath51(te@xmath10s@xmath9)@xmath11 is larger than that of fe@xmath12(te@xmath10se@xmath9)@xmath11 with same doping content , which will lead to the larger @xmath52 .",
    "it is consistent with the previous reported result.@xcite third , @xmath40 can be decreased , i.e. larger @xmath38 , if the stoner factor increases via enhancement of @xmath47 by ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction between local magnetic moments of fe(2 ) with itinerant electrons .",
    "we expect low content of s doping to have small effect on high @xmath45.@xcite@xmath14@xcite on the other hand , large @xmath39 can also be explained via increasing kondo - type scattering from excess fe , consistent with the definition of @xmath39 , which is proportional to the spin - flip scattering rate.@xcite@xmath14maki    in order to confirm that the excess fe can be seen as the kondo - type impurity , in the next section we study the normal state properties systematically .",
    "4(a ) shows the temperature dependence of @xmath53 in zero field from 1.8 k to 300 k. as seen from the data , s-09 exhibits a non - metallic resistivity behavior in normal state , in agreement with measurements on polycrystals.@xcite similar behavior has also been observed in fete with low se content doping,@xcite@xmath14@xcite@xmath14@xcite ascribed to two dimensional ( 2d ) weak localization.liu tj however , our analysis indicates clearly that @xmath21 can originate from kondo - type scattering due to excess fe .",
    "it can be seen clearly that the normal state resistivity at zero field satisfies hamann s equation perfectly ( fig .",
    "4(a ) ) : @xmath54=@xmath55+@xmath56[1-ln(@xmath16/@xmath57)/\\{(ln@xmath58(@xmath16/@xmath57)+@xmath59(@xmath60 + 1)}@xmath61 , where @xmath62 is an temperature - independent impurity scattering resistivity , @xmath63 is proportional to the concentration of the local magnetic moment , @xmath57 is kondo temperature , and @xmath60 is set as 1/2.@xcite the fitted parameters are @xmath55=0.76(1 ) @xmath64 , @xmath56=0.54(1 ) @xmath64 , @xmath57=24.3(4 ) k. inset of fig .",
    "4(a ) shows the region at low temperature , where it can be seen that hamann s equation is valid approximately down to temperatures @xmath65 .",
    "it should be noted that after deducting the magnetoresistance , the normal - state resistivity at @xmath66=35 t still increases with decreasing temperature for both field directions , showing saturation trend as expected for @xmath54(@xmath16 ) of diluted impurities below t@xmath67.@xcite this behavior is an important distinction from the metallic resistivity above @xmath7 in 1111 and 122 systems , even fese@xmath9,@xcite@xmath14@xcite@xmath14@xcite because these systems do not contain excess fe with local moment .",
    "negative magnetoresistance ( nmr ) in the normal state ( fig .",
    "4(b ) ) further suggests the effect of excess fe .",
    "nmr observed in s-09 is rather unusual when compared to other iron - based superconductors , such as 1111 and 122 systems where positive mr violates kohler scaling due to multiband effects or the depletion of density of states at the fermi surface with temperature change.@xcite observed nmr is most likely ascribed to suppressing incoherent kondo spin - flip scattering , which has been intensively studied in dilute alloy systems.@xcite the absolute values of mr increase with increasing field at the constant temperature and the mr effect is weaker with the temperature increase .",
    "moreover , the mr effect is more pronounced for h@xmath22ab than for h@xmath22c .",
    "similar nmr have been seen in excess iron doped tase@xmath20 and ascribed to kondo - type scattering.@xcite    fig .",
    "4(b , c ) show the magnetic - field dependence of hall resistivity @xmath68 and @xmath69 determined from the slope of hall resistivity @xmath70 at different temperatures .",
    "the positive @xmath69 above @xmath7 indicates that the electronic transport is dominated by hole - type carriers .",
    "we observe no abrupt change in carrier density at the temperature of magnetic transition.@xcite this is consistent with arpes and optical spectroscopy observations , implying that there is no gap at the fermi surface below the magnetic transition .",
    "there is strong temperature dependence of @xmath69 that increases continuously with increasing temperature .",
    "the @xmath69 bending at low temperatures can be ascribed to skew scattering.@xcite the combined influence of ordinary hall effect r@xmath71 and skew scattering due to kondo scattering is expected to follow r@xmath72(t)=r@xmath71+a/(t-@xmath73 ) dependence where @xmath73 characterizes the strength of exchange interaction between local moments .",
    "we obtained excellent fitting results ( red curve in fig .",
    "the value of @xmath73 is -57.9(1 ) k , which indicates that the exchange interaction between fe is antiferromagnetic .",
    "the similar behavior has also been observed in other iron - based systems was explained by localization behavior induced by disorder , multiband effects or partial gapping fermi surface with decreasing temperature.@xcite@xmath14@xcite@xmath14@xcite furthermore , using the obtained r@xmath72(@xmath16=0)=3.02@xmath7410@xmath75 m@xmath76/c , i.e. the zero - temperature carrier concentration @xmath77=2.07@xmath7410@xmath78 @xmath79 , and obtained residual resistivity @xmath56=1.84 @xmath80 from the hamann s equation , we can evaluate the mean free path of s-09 , @xmath81=1.35 nm using drude model @xmath81=@xmath82 .",
    "this confirms that s-09 is a dirty - limit superconductor since @xmath83=0.396 .",
    "in summary , the anisotropy in the upper critical field of fe@xmath0(te@xmath1s@xmath2)@xmath11 single crystals was studied in high and stable magnetic fields up to 35 t. we found that the zero - temperature upper critical field is much smaller than the predicted result of whh theory without the spin - paramagnetic effect .",
    "the anisotropy of the upper critical field decreases with decreasing temperature , becoming nearly isotropic at low temperature .",
    "the spin - paramagnetic effect is the dominant pair - breaking mechanism for both h@xmath22ab and h@xmath22c crystallographic axes .",
    "there is obvious spin - orbital scattering effect in this system .",
    "our results show no abrupt change in the carrier density at the temperature of magnetic transition and considerable kondo - type scattering effects on resistivity , mr and hall properties .",
    "all of these results indicate that the excess fe in fe(2 ) site act as kondo - type impurities and play a key role in the exotic normal and superconducting state properties .",
