    "the radio bright ( @xmath2 mjy ) radio sky consists for the most part of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) whose radio emission is generated from the gravitational potential associated with a supermassive black - hole and includes the classical extended jet and double lobe radio sources as well as compact radio components more directly associated with the energy generation and collimation near the central engine .",
    "below 1 mjy there is an increasing contribution to the radio source population from synchrotron emission resulting from relativistic plasma ejected from supernovae associated with massive star formation in galaxies .",
    "after years of intense debate , however , this contribution appears not to be overwhelming , at least down to @xmath3jy .",
    "deep ( @xmath4jy ) radio observations of the vla - chandra deep field south ( cdfs ) , complemented by a variety of data at other frequencies , imply a roughly 50/50 split between star - forming galaxies ( sfg ) and agn @xcite , in broad agreement with other recent papers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "about half of the agn are radio - quiet , that is of the type normally found in optically selected samples and characterised by relatively low radio - to - optical flux density ratios and radio powers @xcite .",
    "these objects represent an almost negligible minority above 1 mjy .",
    "this source population issue is strongly related to the very broad and complex relationship between star formation and agn in the universe . at the cosmological level",
    ", the growth of supermassive black holes in agn appears to be correlated with the growth of stellar mass in galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "at the local level , the accreting gas feeding the black hole at the centre of the agn might trigger a starburst .",
    "the black hole in turn feeds energy back to its surroundings through winds and jets , which can compress the gas and therefore accelerate star formation but can also blow it all away , thereby stopping accretion and star formation altogether .",
    "although the details are still not entirely settled , there is however increasing evidence that in the co - evolution of supermassive black holes and galaxies nuclear activity plays a major role through the so - called `` agn feedback '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "radio observations afford a view of the universe unaffected by the absorption , which plagues most other wavelengths , and therefore provide a vital contribution to our understanding of this co - evolution . however , while we have a reasonably good handle on the radio evolution and luminosity functions ( lfs ) of powerful sources ( e.g. , radio quasars ) , the situation for the intrinsically fainter , and therefore more numerous , radio sources is still murky .",
    "for example , it is still not entirely clear how strongly low - luminosity , fanaroff - riley ( fr ) type i radio galaxies evolve @xcite .",
    "moreover , the widely used sfg lf of @xcite is highly uncertain at the low end ( @xmath5 w hz@xmath6 ) because , although these sources are intrinsically very numerous , the volume within which they can be detected is small ( their `` visibility function '' is very low ) .",
    "indeed , a source with @xmath7 w hz@xmath6 _ could _ be detected in the deepest radio image currently available @xcite out to @xmath8 , but it is not @xcite , because the survey area is too small . and already at @xmath9 , assuming a luminosity evolution @xmath10 , such a source would have a flux density as low as @xmath11jy .",
    "finally , there are still no published results on the radio evolution of radio - quiet agn , which are intrinsically weak sources ( @xmath12 w hz@xmath6 ) and a non - negligible component of the sub - mjy sky .",
    "note that faint ( sub-@xmath0jy ) radio sources have also been proposed by @xcite as the main contributors to the extragalactic radio background recently reported by the arcade 2 collaboration @xcite .",
    "deeper radio observations over large areas of the sky are desperately needed to determine the lf and evolution of the most common radio sources in the universe .",
    "these will soon be realised , as radio astronomy is at the verge of a revolution , which will usher in an era of large area surveys reaching flux density limits well below current ones .",
    "the square kilometre array ( ska ) , in fact , will offer an observing window between 70 mhz and 10 ghz extending well into the _ nanojy _ regime with unprecedented versatility .",
    "the field of view will be large , up to @xmath13 deg@xmath14 below 0.3 ghz and possibly reaching @xmath15 deg@xmath14 at 1.4 ghz .",
    "first science with @xmath16 ska should be near the end of this decade",
    ". location will be in the southern hemisphere , either australia or south africa .",
    "many surveys are being planned with the ska , possibly comprising an  all - sky \" 1 @xmath0jy survey at 1.4 ghz and an hi survey out to redshift @xmath17 , which should include @xmath18 galaxies",
    ".    the ska will not be the only participant to this revolution . the low frequency array ( lofar )",
    "has recently started operations and will carry out large area surveys at 15 , 30 , 60 , 120 and 200 mhz ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) , opening up a whole new region of parameter space at low radio frequencies .",
    "many other radio telescopes are currently under construction in the lead - up to the ska including the expanded very large array ( evla ) , the australian square kilometre array pathfinder ( askap ) , the allen telescope array , apertif , and meerkat .",
    "these projects will survey the sky vastly faster than is possible with existing radio telescopes producing surveys covering large areas of the sky down to fainter flux densities than presently available .",
    "current deep surveys include a number of vla small area surveys below 0.1 mjy at a few ghz , reaching a maximum area of @xmath19 deg@xmath14 ( vla - cosmos ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a minimum flux density @xmath20jy at 1.4 ghz ( swire ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath21jy at 8.4 ghz ( sa 13 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; * ? ? ? * ) and the faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters ( first ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) only reach 1.4 ghz limits of 2.5 and 1 mjy respectively but cover much larger areas ( 82% and 22% of the sky respectively ) .    what lies beneath the surface of the deepest surveys we currently have ?",
    "predictions for the source population at radio flux densities @xmath22jy have been made , amongst others , by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these papers have presented detailed estimates for the number counts of faint radio sources predicting , for example , that sfg should make up @xmath23 of the total population at @xmath24jy @xcite but had to rely , for obvious reasons , on extrapolations .",
    "only the last two papers include radio - quiet agn in their modelling by converting their x - ray lf to the radio band assuming a linear correlation between radio and x - ray powers .",
    "most importantly , as described below , two crucial constituents of the sub-@xmath0jy sky have been excluded by all of these studies .",
    "the first aim of this paper is then to have a broad look at the likely astrophysical populations , which make up the very faint radio sky . but detecting sources is only part of the story , as then comes the identification process .",
    "this requires a wealth of multi - wavelength data , ranging from the optical / near - ir imaging needed to provide an optical counterpart and , when needed , photometric redshifts , to the optical / near - ir spectra required to estimate a redshift , and hence the distance of sources , to the x - ray data , which are vital to separate agn from sfg , to the mid - infrared colours , which provide additional information on this separation .",
    "the second goal of this work is then to provide estimates for the the x - ray , optical , and mid - infrared fluxes these sources are likely to have .",
    "optical magnitudes will also determine how feasible it will be to obtain redshifts for them .",
    "this kind of information is important for planning purposes , to be ready to take full advantage of the new , deep radio data , and also to maximise the synergy between the ska and its pathfinders , and present but also , most importantly , future missions .",
    "to the best of my knowledge , these estimates have never been made before .    throughout this paper spectral indices",
    "are written @xmath25 , magnitudes are in the ab system , and the values @xmath26 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 have been used , unless otherwise noted .",
    "all the radio results refer to 1.4 ghz .",
    "although i mention only the ska throughout the paper , my results obviously apply to any other radio telescope producing surveys reaching the @xmath0jy level .",
    "i also make reference to a large number of missions and projects , for which i give mainly sensitivity information .",
    "readers wanting to know more should consult the relevant world wide web pages , whose addresses are provided in the text .",
    "i present here a simple approach to study the radio sky source population , based on only two parameters : the smallest flux density and the largest surface density of radio sources . the main idea is to provide robust results based on some basic observables and to pay particular attention to _ all _ populations reaching below the @xmath0jy level .",
    "the smallest flux density @xmath29 of a population of sources depends on the minimum radio power at @xmath30 , @xmath31 , the maximum redshift of the sources , @xmath32 , and any luminosity evolution @xmath33 , where @xmath34 . if evolution peaks at @xmath35 and then stops , then",

    "therefore , while low - power ellipticals , which are both faint and not that numerous , are most likely unimportant , for dwarf galaxies the situation is less obvious . on one hand , even with the largest scaling factor used in sect .",
    "[ opt_mag ] , dwarf galaxies account for only @xmath268 of the sub - mjy background .",
    "but on the other hand , the radio lf is not known and , as discussed above , the radio number counts of dwarf galaxies could well be higher .",
    "the determination of the surface densities for all classes of radio sources allows us also to determine the _ intrinsic _ ratio between radio - loud and radio - quiet agn .",
    "the surface density of ssrqs and fsrqs combined is @xmath269 deg@xmath89 , while that of radio - quiet , broad - lined agn is @xmath270 deg@xmath89 , since unabsorbed agn are supposed to make up @xmath271 of the total @xcite .",
    "this translates to a radio - loud fraction in broad - lined agn @xmath272 .",
    "if one considers both broad- and narrow - lined sources , which means including also fr iis in the radio - loud class and all radio - quiet agn , one gets a similar fraction @xmath273 .",
    "these numbers are much smaller than the oft - quoted value of @xmath274 .",
    "however , it has been known for some time that the radio - loud fraction drops with decreasing optical luminosity @xcite .",
    "very recently , @xcite have shown that the fraction of radio - loud quasars at @xmath275 declines from 24% to 6% as luminosity decreases from @xmath276 to @xmath277 , while at @xmath276 this fractions declines from 24% to 4% as redshift increases from 0.5 to 3 .",
    "both these results suggest that the intrinsic , global ratio has to be @xmath278 .",
    "but if the radio - loud fraction were this large , the radio - loud quasar surface density should be @xmath279 deg@xmath89 , that is @xmath280 times larger than estimated here and also @xmath281 larger than that of fr iis , which are supposed to be the parent population of both ssrqs and fsrqs . scaling up the fr ii surface density as well to avoid this paradox",
    ", one would end up having more fr iis than fr is , which would not make any sense at all , since fr iis are more powerful . in short , the surface densities derived in this paper point to an agn radio - loud fraction much smaller than normally derived .",
    "this difference is likely to be ascribed to two factors : a ) the usually quoted value has been obtained for bright , optically selected samples @xcite , which include radio - loud quasars with their optical flux boosted by relativistic beaming @xcite , which artificially increases their fraction ; b ) radio - loud agn are on average more powerful than radio - quiet ones ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "when one reaches the very faint end of the optical lf only radio - quiet agn will be present and therefore the integrated radio - loud fraction will be quite small .",
    "in other words , the usually quoted value refers to the bright part of the lf and , when integrated over the full range of powers , the resulting radio - loud fraction is much smaller .",
    "the second factor is likely to be the most relevant one .",
    "the issue of source confusion goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "i will just point out that @xcite have shown that ultra - deep radio and optical surveys may slowly approach the natural confusion limit , where objects start to overlap with their neighbours due to their finite sizes and not because of the finite instrumental resolution , which causes the instrumental confusion limit .",
    "based on the model of @xcite , confusion will not be a problem for the ska if source sizes are @xmath282 at @xmath219jy ( or @xmath283 at @xmath284 nanojy ) and the instrumental resolution is commensurate @xcite .",
    "however , since @xcite did not include radio - quiet agn , low - power ellipticals , or dwarf galaxies , confusion limits are bound to be higher .",
    "indeed , @xcite , based on the relatively flat number counts derived from their deep radio data , have suggested that the natural confusion limit may be reached near @xmath87jy .",
    "i have used a simple method to work out the source population of the sub-@xmath0jy sky , which relies on estimating the smallest flux density and the largest surface density for all classes of radio sources .",
    "these two parameters can be derived quite robustly from the local minimum radio power and number of sources per unit volume , maximum redshift , and luminosity and density evolution .",
    "i have then estimated for the first time the x - ray , optical , and mid - infrared fluxes these faint radio sources are likely to have by using prototypical sources , typical flux density ratios , and extrapolations from the vla - cdfs sample .",
    "prognosticating these multi - wavelength properties is extremely relevant for the identification of @xmath0jy and nanojy radio sources and to maximise the synergy between the ska and its pathfinders with future missions in bands other than the radio .",
    "my main results can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "the sub-@xmath0jy sky should consist of radio - quiet agn ( @xmath285 deg@xmath89 ) and star - forming galaxies ( @xmath286 deg@xmath89 ) , both of which should get to @xmath287 nanojy . in agreement with previous studies , i find that classical , powerful radio sources , that is radio quasars and fr iis , do not make it to sub-@xmath0jy flux densities and reach @xmath288 mjy , with bl lacs and fr is getting to the @xmath289jy level .",
    "the _ intrinsic _ fraction of radio - loud agn , integrated over the whole bolometric luminosity function , is @xmath290 , that is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the oft - quoted value of @xmath274 .",
    "the latter value refers only to the bright part of the optical luminosity function and is also biased because of the likely flux boosting in radio - loud quasars due to relativistic beaming .",
    "two `` new '' populations , which have not been considered previously , appear to be very relevant : low - power ( @xmath259 w hz@xmath6 ) ellipticals and dwarf galaxies .",
    "using the available ( scanty ) information , the former should reach similar flux and surface densities as radio - quiet agn , while the latter could easily be the most numerous component of the faint radio sky ( @xmath291 deg@xmath89 ) , with flux densities as low as @xmath292 nanojy",
    ". since most galaxies at the faint end of the lf are blue , most dwarfs in the universe ( and therefore most radio sources ) should be of the star - forming type . while low - power ellipticals are most likely unimportant contributors to the radio background , the verdict is still open for dwarf galaxies .",
    "this issue is quite important also in light of the very recent background measurements reported by the arcade 2 collaboration @xcite .",
    "the bulk of the @xmath0jy population , which is then most probably going to be made up of star - forming galaxies , is likely to have x - ray fluxes beyond the reach of all currently planned x - ray missions , including ixo .",
    "the same applies to fr is .",
    "even ixo will only detect radio - quiet agn with radio flux densities @xmath293jy .",
    "the situation will obviously be worse in the nanojy regime , where very few radio sources will have an x - ray counterpart in the foreseeable future .",
    "on the other hand , basically all extragalactic sources in the erosita all - sky and wide surveys and wfxt wide survey will have an ska counterpart , as they will be characterised by @xmath153jy .",
    "this will help in the identification of , for example , the 10 million or so point sources expected in the latter , by also providing very accurate positions .",
    "5 .   in the mid - infrared most star - forming galaxies and radio - quiet agn should be detected by jwst down to radio flux densities @xmath239jy and by spica down to @xmath155 nanojy , while fr is will be largely undetected even by spica .",
    "both telescopes will however be covering a relatively small field of view .",
    "only a minute fraction of @xmath0jy and nanojy star - forming galaxies and radio quiet agn will have a counterpart in current all - sky infrared surveys ( wise and akari ) . on the positive side",
    ", all extragalactic sources in the wise and akari all - sky surveys will easily have an ska counterpart , as they will be characterised by @xmath241jy .",
    "6 .   since the radio , far - infrared , and x - ray emission all trace star formation , this implies relatively tight relationships between these three bands , which in turn means that we can reasonably predict the mid - infrared and x - ray properties of star - forming galaxies with faint radio flux densities",
    "the situation is different in the optical band , where evolved stars dominate .",
    "objects characterised by higher star formation rates will have larger radio - to - optical flux density ratios , which means fainter magnitudes for a given radio flux density .",
    "the typical magnitudes of the optical counterparts of faint radio sources depend then on which type of star - forming galaxy ( starburst , spiral , or dwarf ) will be predominant .",
    "moreover , in the optical band k - correction and intergalactic absorption effects are important and will result in fainter than expected magnitudes .",
    "assuming a maximum value of star formation rate for `` normal '' spirals , which translates to a maximum radio power , i estimate that these sources should outnumber starbursts for @xmath212jy .",
    "if even distant spirals are characterised by relatively low rest - frame radio - to - optical flux density ratios , then most @xmath0jy sources should be detected by pan - starrs and certainly by the lsst . at fainter radio flux densities optical magnitudes",
    "should also get fainter , unless dwarf galaxies , with their lower radio - to - optical flux density ratios , become dominant . depending on the relative fraction of starbursts , spirals , and dwarfs , jwst and especially the elts",
    "could be the main , or perhaps even the only , facilities capable of securing optical counterparts of nanojy radio sources .",
    "on the other hand , and for the same reasons discussed above , the bulk of pan - starrs and lsst sources might not have radio flux densities within reach of the ska .",
    "7 .   as regards redshifts ,",
    "the same complications described above apply , since the optical band is still involved . within the same uncertainties , then , many of the sources with @xmath294jy might be too faint for 8/10 m telescopes to be able to provide a redshift determination and the situation might get worse at fainter flux densities , unless dwarf galaxies are prevalent .",
    "this means that jwst and particularly the elts might be the primary facilities to secure redshifts of @xmath0jy radio sources .",
    "but even they could have problems in the nanojy regime .    in summary ,",
    "the ska and its pathfinders will have a huge impact on a number of open problems in extragalactic astronomy . apart from the `` obvious '' study of star - forming galaxies in their various incarnations and `` classical '' radio sources , these include also less evident ones , ranging from what makes a galaxy radio - loud ( through the study of low - power ellipticals ) , to why most agn are radio - quiet ( by selecting large samples independent of obscuration ) , to the incidence and evolution of dwarf galaxies ( by providing a `` cleaner '' radio selection , which might by - pass the surface brightness problems of optical samples ) , to the resolution of the radio background .",
    "identifying faint radio sources , however , will not be easy . on large areas of the sky",
    "the ska will be quite alone in the multi - wavelength arena , with the likely exception of the optical band and even there probably only down to @xmath152jy .",
    "spica , jwst , and especially the elts will be a match for the ska but only on small areas and above @xmath295jy . at fainter flux densities",
    "one might have to resort to  radio only \" information , that is hi redshifts , size , morphology , spectral index , etc .",
    ", although i think this will not be sufficient . on the bright side , most sources from currently planned all - sky surveys , with the likely exception of the optical ones , will have an ska counterpart .",
    "the idea for this paper came to me while preparing a talk for the ska 2010 meeting held in manchester , uk , in march 2010 . my thanks to the organisers of that meeting for inviting me .",
    "i also thank michael hilker , ken kellermann , jochen liske , vincenzo mainieri , nicola menci , steffen mieske , and piero rosati for useful discussions , and the anonymous referee for his / her suggestions .",
