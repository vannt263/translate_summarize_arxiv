    "boiling is widely used to transfer heat from a solid heater to a liquid .",
    "the bubble growth in boiling attracted much of attention from many scientists and engineers . in spite of these efforts ,",
    "some important aspects of growth of a vapor bubble attached to a solid heater remain misunderstood even on a phenomenological level .",
    "the most important aspect is the boiling crisis , a transition from nucleate boiling ( where vapor bubbles nucleate on the heater ) to film boiling ( where the heater is covered by a continuous vapor film ) .",
    "the boiling crisis is observed when the heat flux @xmath0 from the solid heater exceeds a threshold value which is called the `` critical heat flux '' ( chf ) .",
    "the rapid formation of the vapor film on the heater surface decreases steeply the heat transfer efficiency and leads to a local heater overheating . in the industrial heat exchangers , the boiling crisis can lead to melting of the heater thus provoking a dangerous accident . therefore , the knowledge of the chf is extremely important .",
    "however , the chf depends on many parameters . at this time",
    ", there are several semi - empirical correlations that predict the chf more or less reliably for several particular regimes of boiling and heater configurations , see @xcite for a recent review . however , a clear understanding of the triggering mechanism of the boiling crisis is still lacking .    the knowledge about what happens at the foot of the bubble which grows attached to the heater is crucial for the correct modeling of the boiling crisis .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental observations at large heat fluxes close to the chf are complicated by the violence of boiling and optical distortions caused by the strong temperature gradients .",
    "we proposed recently @xcite to carry out boiling experiments in the proximity of the critical point where the chf is very small and the bubble evolution is very slow .",
    "however , microgravity conditions are necessary in this case to obtain a convex bubble shape in order to observe a behavior similar to the terrestrial boiling .",
    "the bubble foot contains the contact line of the bubble with the heater .",
    "this triple solid - liquid - gas contact line is a line of singularity points both for the hydrodynamic ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) and for the heat conduction problems . in the present article we consider only the heat conduction part by assuming the slow growth and the quasi - static bubble shape which is common for the high pressure boiling .",
    "the results of such a calculation have already been described in @xcite .",
    "the present article deals with the problem framework and some calculation details related to bem .",
    "the choice of the boundary conditions adopted in the contact line is very important .",
    "since the contact line is triple , boundary conditions should be specified at three surfaces that intersect there ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    ,",
    "height=226 ]    for the gas - liquid interface , we adopt the constant - temperature boundary condition with the temperature that corresponds to the saturation temperature @xmath1 for the given ( constant ) system pressure .",
    "the gas phase is assumed to be non - conductive , the heat flux through the solid - gas interface being zero .",
    "the boundary condition on the solid - liquid interface remains to be defined .",
    "it is the subject of the rest of this section .",
    "there are three kinds of boundary conditions .",
    "let us consider them on an example of the 2d wedge geometry as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for which some important solutions can be obtained in analytical form .",
    "since the heater is a far better heat conductor than the liquid , the constant temperature boundary condition ( @xmath2const along the solid - liquid interface ) seems natural . in order to maintain boiling",
    ", @xmath3 should be satisfied .",
    "the resulting problem is ill posed because the temperature is discontinuous along the boundary of the liquid domain at the contact point o in fig .",
    "this discontinuity leads to a singular behavior of the heat flux @xmath4 through the gas - liquid boundary , @xmath5 @xcite and is not integrable .",
    "note that the integral @xmath6 is very important because it defines the amount of liquid evaporated into the bubble and thus the bubble growth rate , see eq .",
    "( [ eqnv ] ) below .",
    "since the result is infinite , the first kind boundary condition can not be used .",
    "another choice is the constant heat flux @xmath0 along the solid - liquid interface , which can be reasonable for a thin heater .",
    "the resulting transient problem can be solved analytically in the liquid domain by the reflections method @xcite .",
    "its solution can be obtained in the closed form for several contact angles @xmath7 , see fig .",
    "the solutions obtained in @xcite for @xmath8 and @xmath9 result in a constant value for @xmath10 . although the solution for @xmath11 diverges @xmath12 @xcite , it is integrable . in spite of these advantages ,",
    "the constant heat flux boundary condition is not suitable for the bubble growth problem because it can not be used in the dry spot ( i. e. solid - gas contact ) area where the heat flux should be zero .",
    "however , these analytical solutions can be used to test the bem solver code ( see fig .  [ test ] ) .",
    "curves calculated for the @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 wedges for the values of the parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 and two values of the time step @xmath20 . the results of the numerical solution by bem ( data points ) should be compared with the exact analytical solutions ( lines).,height=226 ]    a remaining option is the boundary conditions of a third kind , i.e. the coupling of the temperatures and the fluxes at the solid surface .",
    "the heat conduction problem is required to be solved in the solid domain in addition to the liquid domain .",
    "unfortunately , we can not solve the problem analytically in this case .",
    "qualitatively , one can expect an integrable divergence of @xmath21 which should appear because of the influence of the solid - gas contact area adjacent to the contact line .",
    "since the heat flux that comes from the bulk of the solid heater is not able to pass through this area , it should be necessarily deviated towards the neighboring solid - liquid contact area thus increasing @xmath0 at small @xmath22 .",
    "since @xmath23 near the contact line , @xmath21 should vary steeper near the contact line than in the constant @xmath0 case and is likely to diverge .",
    "one can argue that the necessity of the calculation of the temperature field in the heater is a heavy complication that justifies the approximation of the simultaneous application of the boundary conditions of constant heat flux outside the dry spot and zero heat flux inside .",
    "however , the above considerations show that the behavior of @xmath21 can deviate from its real behavior even qualitatively .",
    "since such a large error can not be admitted in the calculation of @xmath24 that strongly influences the bubble dynamics , we need to calculate rigorously the conjugate heat conduction problem .",

    "it can be solved by bem .",
    "however , it is not convenient to solve by bem because the temperature and its gradient are both non - zero at infinity ( more precisely , at @xmath74 ) , where the closing subcontours for the domains @xmath26 and @xmath75 are located .",

    "<S> we report a 2d bem modeling of the thermal diffusion - controlled growth of a vapor bubble attached to a heating surface during saturated pool boiling . </S>",
    "<S> the transient heat conduction problem is solved in a liquid that surrounds a bubble with a free boundary and in a semi - infinite solid heater . </S>",
    "<S> the heat generated homogeneously in the heater causes evaporation , i. e. the bubble growth . </S>",
    "<S> a singularity exists at the point of the triple ( liquid - vapor - solid ) contact . at high system pressure </S>",
    "<S> the bubble is assumed to grow slowly , its shape being defined by the surface tension and the vapor recoil force , a force coming from the liquid evaporating into the bubble . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that at some typical time the dry spot under the bubble begins to grow rapidly under the action of the vapor recoil . </S>",
    "<S> such a bubble can eventually spread into a vapor film that can separate the liquid from the heater , thus triggering the boiling crisis ( critical heat flux phenomenon ) . </S>"
