    "+ the combinatorial editing problem is , in general , the problem of finding the smallest number of element - changes such that the resulting combinatorial object satisfies a certain fixed property . the simplest class of objects for which the editing problem was considered is a set of sequences . in fact ,",
    "the first detailed algorithmic study of editing was motivated by bioinformatics , where sequences over finite alphabets are considered and editing corresponds to changes of the elements in the sequence depicting the mutations in biomolecules . when the desired property consists of a single sequence , studying editing corresponds to investigating the hamming distance between sequences .",

    "the analysis is based on using a version of szemerdi s regularity lemma , which we state as theorem  [ thm : multicol : genreglem ] ( see  @xcite for a proof of theorem  [ thm : multicol : genreglem ] ) , and applying it to an erds - rnyi - type random edge - colored graph or random digraph , respectively .",
