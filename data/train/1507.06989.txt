    "the history of fermat s last theorem ( flt ) is so well known , that we restrict ourselves to remind only some important historical facts .    in 1637",
    "fermat wrote his famous marginal note in diophanto s  arithmetica \" , stating the theorem together with the comment that he  had found a remarkable proof , but the margin s space was not enough to write it there \" @xcite .    strangely enough , fermat let elapse 28 years without publishing any proof until he died in 1665 @xcite .",
    "his son published the note in 1670 @xcite , so starting the flt saga .",
    "the theorem resisted the efforts of the best mathematicians for a lot more than three hundred years , so much so , that in the seventies of last century it was wide spread the opinion that fermat realized that what he had in mind was a wrong or an incomplete proof @xcite .",
    "finally , in the late nineties , the british mathematician andrew wiles achieved a full flt proof",
    ". a very brilliant and sophisticated one .",
    "indeed , the way he chose was through a previous proof of shimura  taniyama  weil conjecture , not yet achieved at that time , considered more general than flt , even more difficult and implying the flt proof .",
    "this approach gave wiles the opportunity of producing a lot of remarkable contributions mainly in the fields of elliptic curves modularity , topology and number theory @xcite , @xcite .",
    "obviously , this asked for an extensive use of outstanding modern mathematical concepts , all this work deserving congratulations , because the resulting progress of nowadays mathematics .",
    "fermat did a similar thing regarding the mathematics of his time , but failed in his  last theorem \" .",
    "still an interesting historical note is that _ flt in the special case @xmath14 , was already known in ancient greece _ under the name of  _ the cube s duplication problem _ \" .",
    "_ mathematically _ , the rising of this question is quite natural .",
    "indeed , pythagoras , with his fundamental theorem , had _ duplicated the square_. so , why not to start thinking of duplicating a cube ? in other words , given an integer and its cube , to find two other integers such that the sum of their cubes equals the first cube .",
    "notorious intellectuals , such as arquitas , democritus and many others , became interested , but none solved the problem .",
    "_ the situation remained so for more than two thousand years_. then , a century after fermat s marginal note , _ euler has proved that the problem was an impossible one_.    reminding all we said now , we kept the opinion that it seems quite defensible to think that achieving a full and very simple flt proof still remains an open and quite challenging problem .",
    "after some time and unsuccessful attempts , we have been lucky enough to find this way .",
    "the equation @xmath15 admits no integer solutions in @xmath16 and @xmath2 if @xmath17 , also an integer , is greater than 2 . this is equivalent to the following .",
    "from now on and just for short , we refer to the theorem writing flt .    by definition",
    ", we say that the inequality between the @xmath2 power and the sum of the other two , with the same exponent , is _ unreversed _ if the signal is @xmath19 and _ reversed _ if @xmath20 .",
    "when it happens @xmath10 and @xmath21 , we call @xmath3 the _ reversion exponent_. supposing that there are solutions of the diophatine equation form in the statement , its form , implies @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "in conformity with these implications are the two hypothesis @xmath24 .",
    "however , @xmath25 remains reversed with @xmath26 .",
    "the same happens to @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "the complementar of @xmath24 is @xmath29 .",
    "now the representative segments of @xmath16 and @xmath2 may define a triangle .",
    "triangles can be classified through the parameter _ greatest inner angle , @xmath30_. if @xmath31 , @xmath2 is too large to define a pythagorean triplet with @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "hence , @xmath32 , so @xmath33 .    with @xmath34",
    "we have a right triangle .",
    "its inequality reverses through an intermediary equality , @xmath35 .",
    "but , from @xmath36 and @xmath37 we have @xmath38 , so @xmath14 .",
    "we remark that @xmath39 _ gives @xmath2 irrational , not integer _ , with exponents one and any other odd number .",
    "it follows @xmath40 .",
    "this subdivides in three cases .",
    "one with all inner angles @xmath41 , so @xmath42 , contradicting @xmath22 and @xmath23 , then no solutions here .",
    "geometrically , the inequality @xmath43 never reverses , whatever the exponent , thus , also no @xmath3 .",
    "another similar situation happens with two @xmath30 and the opposite sides @xmath2 equal , contradicting @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "then again no solutions and no @xmath3 .    from what have been said and also from the symbology about @xmath0 and @xmath1 being arbitrary",
    ", we can assume with no loss of generality , @xmath44 therefore , the only remaining triangle s type is defined by @xmath40 and all sides different . now @xmath2 is not large enough to define a pythagorean triplet with @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ". then , the inequations defining this triangle are @xmath45 the second showing that _ to get out of the situation unreversed _ ,",
    "an exponent , _ depending on @xmath46 and @xmath2 and greater than two _ is needed , @xmath47 what have been said up to now is synthesized in table [ tab:1 ] below , the symbol @xmath48 meaning  triangle \" .",
    ".triplets classification .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     it is now clear that proving flt in general terms is reduced to do that in the special terms .",
    "one of such conditions is the existence of two consecutive integers , @xmath49 and @xmath3 , _ depending on @xmath46 and @xmath2 _ , and such that @xmath50an alternative and equivalent way of stating is the following .",
    "if we imagine the exponent as being the continuous variable in @xmath13 , the implicit function @xmath51defines @xmath52 in terms of @xmath46 and @xmath2 and with the requirement @xmath53n-1,n [   \\label{eq3.3}\\ ] ]      for @xmath54 , we define @xmath55 from @xmath56 , then @xmath57 so , @xmath58 this , together with show that the @xmath59 are rational numbers , increasing with @xmath60 , but always satisfying @xmath61 we can now compare the successions of the @xmath62 powers with that of the @xmath63 , @xmath64 showing that the @xmath62 grow  faster \" than the @xmath63 .",
    "thus , there is a certain @xmath60 such that @xmath65 , and so for any further @xmath60 . by other words , _ when the exponents increase _ , @xmath29 in reverses and remains so for any further exponent .",
    "this allows to define the number @xmath49 in as follows : @xmath66      when the exponents increase the initial triangle changes size and shape up to exponents @xmath49 , with which there is still a triangle whose inequality is @xmath67 with exponents @xmath3 , _ be flt true or false _ , there is no triangle , because @xmath15 , or @xmath21 , corresponding the first to flt false , and the second to flt true , _ define no triangle_. and , as already shown by and , the inequality is reversed _ with any exponent greater than @xmath3_.    this gives two conclusions :    \\a ) without contradiction , flt can only be supposed false with exponents @xmath3 .",
    "\\b ) with exponents @xmath49 the triangle @xmath68 can be called  the last triangle \" .",
    "its nature may be found squaring the sides , giving exponents @xmath69 . to the inequality @xmath29 being surely reversed it must be @xmath70 , this asking for @xmath4 , which is precisely the case as shown by and . then , @xmath71 proving that in the last triangle , @xmath72 of , @xmath31 ; _ independent of @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath2_.    we remark that the reversion in the squares , , is not  strong \" enough to prove flt , because this theorem",
    "_ asks for a reversion of in the next integer exponent @xmath3_.      about the necessary and sufficient condition , we have already proved the ever existence of the number @xmath49 , defined by .",
    "hence , it remains to prove the second of , which can be written in the form @xmath73 this positive difference , _ if flt is true _ , defines an interval in @xmath13 , of numbers , @xmath74 .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath75 this clearly shows that  flt is true \" is a proposition _ admiting a continuous infinity of proving ways _ , each one through a particular value of @xmath74 .",
    "hence , the next step is to find an algorithm linking @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath2 with the @xmath74 .",
    "we start to do that searching for a continuous set of numbers , @xmath76 , which we call _ reversors _ , because of their property of , _ despite smaller than @xmath2 _ , multiplying by a @xmath77 the @xmath9 in the last triangle s inequality , , _ contradicts the situation unreversed , and , at the same time , gives the solution @xmath21 , to the new situation_.    formally , as the contradiction of @xmath19 is @xmath78 , this property is written @xmath79 it is clear that from , _ to be proved soon _",
    ", the existence of _ at least one @xmath80 is a sufficient condition _ of flt being true . to have the property a @xmath80 must be of the form @xmath81 implying @xmath82 entering with this in ,",
    "we have @xmath83 or @xmath84 giving @xmath85 having retaken the use of the @xmath86 and @xmath87 , defined in sec .",
    "[ sec:3.2 ] .",
    "the @xmath88 property , @xmath89 , confirms that @xmath90 is a @xmath91 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath92 shows that @xmath93 by definition of @xmath94 .",
    "hence , @xmath95__sufficient to prove that flt is true__. indeed , entering with @xmath96 in and performing the calculations gives @xmath97__like we intended to prove__. as @xmath98 , @xmath99and this rises the question of what could be @xmath100 .",
    "dividing by @xmath9 , we obtain @xmath101 having introduce the symbol @xmath102 , which is greater than one by force of .",
    "the signal @xmath78 in gives @xmath103 then , @xmath104 and @xmath105    to verify , we enter with in , giving @xmath106 confirming , not only that @xmath107 , but also that @xmath102 reverses _ in the strongest possible way _ , because the reversion s result is @xmath108 itself , the @xmath109 .",
    "all these considerations are verifiable by the relations @xmath110 or @xmath111 indeed , attending the @xmath90 form , in , supposing @xmath112 gives @xmath113 contradicting .    the alternative , @xmath114 gives @xmath115 i.e. _ flt false , with exponents @xmath3 _ , contradicting flt true , as already proved by .",
    "hence , it only remains the conclusion that @xmath116 , as we wanted to verify .",
    "therefore , the main conclusion is that flt _ is also true _ for any triplet of the type .    as in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] above , flt has been proved in all other triplets shown in table [ tab:1 ] , _ this flt full proof is now completed_.    another main conclusion _ is that flt admits a not countable infinity of proving ways _ , each one through a particular value of the number @xmath6 belonging to the set @xmath117 \\ .\\]]__another way showing the existence of a continuous infinity of proving ways is the fact that @xmath12 are the solutions of the compatible opposite sense inequations system _ _ .",
    "the algorithm linking @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath2 with the @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 is the following .    choosing a @xmath91 from the set @xmath121\\ , \\ ] ] we have the corresponding @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "double opening the @xmath124 interval , , the same happens with those of the @xmath12 and @xmath120 .",

    "just @xmath11 .",
    "because of this property , we call the @xmath12 from _ overreversors _ and the respective @xmath126 _ an overreversion _ , because more than needed to prove flt . for example",
    ", if @xmath2 is large enough as @xmath128 , @xmath129 is an overreversor .",
