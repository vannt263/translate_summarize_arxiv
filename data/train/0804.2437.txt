    "according to general relativity , a pseudo - riemannian manifold with signature ( 3,1 ) is the mathematical model of spacetime .",
    "the local properties of spacetime geometry are described by the einstein gravitational field equations .",
    "however , they are only weakly linked @xcite to the global spatial geometry of the universe , i.e. , its topology .",
    "we do not have , so far , any theory which could determine the topology of our universe , therefore it can be constrained only by observations .",
    "the release of _ wmap _ data @xcite has stimulated new studies of multiconnected ( incorrectly dubbed as `` non - trivial '' ) topology recently , particularly since the detected anomalies in the observed cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy on large angular scales  the putative suppression of the quadrupole moment , alignment of the quadrupole and octopole , and an asymmetry in the statistical properties of the northern and southern ecliptic hemispheres @xcite  suggest that our universe may possess multiconnected topology .    amongst all of the multi - connected three - dimensional spaces , flat spaces , and the most natural compact manifold , the 3-torus , have been studied the most extensively in a cosmological context .",
    "this is motivated by current constraints on the curvature radius of the universe as well as computational simplicity .",
    "one of the first related analyses @xcite suggested that a toroidal universe where the smaller dimension was of order half the horizon scale may explain the above anomalies , although a more detailed study @xcite did not confirm this hypothesis .",
    "another topology , the poincar dodecahedron for slightly positively curved space , was proposed by @xcite .",
    "further studies of this topological model revealed some disagreement about whether the topology could be excluded on the basis of the _ wmap _ data or not .",
    "@xcite claimed that the topology can not be excluded , mainly because of insufficient accuracy of the data and degradation of the signal by the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) and doppler contributions .",
    "moreover , @xcite even reported a hint of a detection of pairs of matched circles in the cmb maps which fit quite well to the predictions for this topology .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite ruled it out via the lack of detection of statistically significant pairs of matched circles ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "topological studies of cmb maps generally focus on two signatures of multi - connectedness : the large scale damping of power in the direction of the shorter dimension of the domain , which causes a breakdown of statistical isotropy @xcite , and the distribution of matched patterns @xcite @xcite presents a review of the cmb - related methods used in studies of topology .",
    "it is important to notice that the latter signature is present only when the topological scale is smaller than observable universe , thus methods based on it are less powerful than methods based on the former signatures of multi - connectedness , which are in principle present also if the topological scale is slightly greater than the particle horizon .    in the former case , one usually uses the covariance matrix of the spherical harmonic coefficients @xcite of the sky map as the basis of a statistical study .",
    "however , @xcite used also the so - called multipole vectors , initially proposed by @xcite as a new tool for the analysis of cmb maps .",
    "in contrast to the coordinate dependent coefficients of the spherical harmonic decomposition , the vectors associated with a given multipole point toward the same direction on the sky independently of the reference frame employed .",
    "thus , they are useful tools for the study of statistical isotropy ( irrespective of its topological origin , as we consider here , or otherwise ) . in this paper",
    ", we study in more detail the application of the multipole vector formalism to the detection of signatures of multiconnected topology in the context of the observed alignment of the quadrupole and octopole moments .",
    "because our studies have a rather preliminary character , we will confine ourselves in analysis to the simplest compact topology , i.e. , 3-torus that remains to be ruled out by the data @xcite .    in the following two sections we briefly introduce the multipole vectors and related statistics used in the analysis . in [",
    "sec : topology ] we describe the specific topologies studied . the results of the analysis comparing the 5-year _ wmap _ data to the studied topologies are presented in [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , we summarise the results and draw some conclusions .",
    "the multipole vector formalism was introduced to cmb analysis by @xcite , who showed that a given multipole moment can be represented in terms of @xmath1 unit vectors and an overall magnitude , thus making as expected @xmath2 figures .",
    "as later pointed out by @xcite , the formalism was in fact first discovered long ago by @xcite .",
    "each multipole @xmath3 may therefore be uniquely expressed by @xmath1 multipole vectors @xmath4 and a magnitude @xmath5 . in the notation of @xcite ,",
    "this reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the radial unit vector in spherical coordinates . strictly speaking , the multipole vectors are headless",
    ", thus the sign of each vector can always be absorbed by the scalar @xmath5 .",
    "we will use the convention that all vectors point toward the northern hemisphere .",
    "it is hard to find any convincing physical interpretation of the multipole vectors , because they do not indicate any specific features of the multipoles .",
    "an exception to this rule arises when one considers the contribution to a multipole given by the projection on the last scattering surface of a single plane wave . in this case , all the multipole vectors point towards the direction of the wavevector @xcite .",
    "apart from this very specific case , for the quadrupole one can notice that the multipole vectors point towards the inflection points , such that their cross product points at the saddle points . for the higher order multipoles ,",
    "the vectors indicate at vicinity of the inflection points rather than extremes .    to find the multipole vectors from a given set of spherical harmonic coefficients , @xmath8 , one has to solve a set of non - linear equations @xcite . for a quadrupole the solution of the equations can be written explicitly ( see appendix [ sec : appendix ] ) .",
    "one should notice that the multipole vectors are related non - linearly to the data .",
    "for higher order multipoles the equations are solved numerically . in our codes",
    "we have implemented the algorithm proposed by @xcite .",
    "an alternative was suggested by @xcite .",
    "having computed the multipole vectors , we seek to test a given cmb data set with respect to inter - scale correlations between different multipoles . in order to do so",
    ", we follow @xcite and @xcite and define the following set of simple statistics .",
    "the statistics are based on the dot product , which is a natural measure of vector alignment . however , because the multipole vectors are defined only up to a sign , one needs to consider the absolute value of the dot product .",
    "moreover , the multipole vectors do not have their own identity , therefore all the dot products were summed for a given pair of the multipoles @xmath9 and @xmath10 . at the end , to normalise the statistics to one , the sum were divided by number of the dot products .",
    "we consider also the dot products of the unnormalised cross products of the multipole vectors , @xmath11 , as well normalised cross products , @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "therefore , we could use the following types of statistics for any two multipoles @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( @xmath15 ) : @xmath16 where for the last three types of statistics we used also unnormalised cross products containing more information than the normalised products . then",
    ", the statistics will be denoted by @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the four types of the statistics are as usual referred to as `` vector - vector '' , `` vector - cross '' , `` cross - vector '' and `` cross - cross '' statistics , respectively .",
    "@xmath20 is number of dot products used for a given statistic ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , respectively ) . with such normalisation",
    "the statistics take values in the range @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "because the statistics are based on the dot product , they are rotationally invariant and are sensitive only to the relative orientation of the multipole vectors on the sky , and not on the absolute orientation of the fundamental domain with respect to a given reference frame .",
    "a detailed description of all possible topologies of three - dimensional manifolds with constant curvature were given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a description and summary of the topologies for flat universes , which we will consider in this paper , and methods of simulations of cmb maps for such universes were also given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we will briefly describe here , following their formalism , basic information concerning the topology of the 3-torus .",
    "all flat spaces are obtained as the quotient @xmath26 of the three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath27 by a group @xmath28 of symmetries of @xmath27 that is discrete and fixed - point free .",
    "there are 18 such spaces among which is the standard euclidean space with trivial topology . among the 17 remaining ones , the ten compact flat spaces are quotients of the 3-torus : six are orientable and the rest are non - orientable .",
    "the 3-torus is the quotient of euclidean space under the action of three linearly independent translations @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . the rectangular 3-torus is generated by mutually orthogonal translations @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 where the allowed wave vectors of the cosmological perturbations @xmath35 takes the form @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are dimensions of the fundamental cell , which in this context is called the fundamental domain .    therefore , there are two effects of the multiconnected topology as compared to the euclidean space : the non - isotropic distribution of modes and the discrete power spectrum of the curvature perturbations",
    ". both of these will manifest themselves in the cmb maps mainly by the ordinary sachs - wolfe effect , which dominates on large angular scales .",
    "the two other contributions to the maps , the doppler and integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effects , will rather dilute the signatures of the topology .",
    "the former is significant on scales smaller than the dimensions of the fundamental domain and the latter , though significant on large angular scales , arises from the evolution of structure close to the observer .    to see pronounced signatures of the topology we considered domains with at least one of the dimensions smaller than the diameter of the observed universe .",
    "the distance to the horizon is approximately equal to the distance to the last scattering surface ( lss ) @xmath39 , therefore the diameter is @xmath40 , but depends on the parameters of the cosmological model . for the concordance @xmath41cdm model , used in our work , with the hubble constant , the matter density parameter @xmath42 , the cosmological constant density parameter @xmath43 ,",
    "the diameter is @xmath44 , where the hubble radius @xmath45 .",
    "we analysed the rectangular prisms with dimensions @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( hereafter referred to as t228 ) and and @xmath48 ( hereafter referred to as t882 ) . for such topologies",
    "the allowed wave - vectors are of the form and , respectively , where .",
    "in [ sec : pdf ] we also show some results for the toruses with dimensions and @xmath47 ( hereafter referred to as t448 ) and and @xmath49 ( hereafter referred to as t668 ) .",
    "the longer dimensions are significantly bigger than the diameter of the observable universe ( i.e. , @xmath50 ) therefore , in practice the topologies are indistinguishable from the so - called the chimney and slab spaces , respectively @xcite .",
    "we do not have an analytical expression for either the distribution of the multipole vectors on the sky for a multi - connected universe or for the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the statistics .",
    "therefore we based our analysis on simulated cmb maps for each of the studied topologies with the same cosmological parameters , and in particular use @xmath51  for the distribution of the vectors on the sky , and @xmath0  for the pdf of the statistics .",
    "the signatures of a multiconnected topology are most clearly visible for the low order multipoles , so we confined the analysis only to the multipoles of order @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "for such a range of multipoles we have 21 different pairs of multipoles for the multipole vector statistics .",
    "we did not add noise in the simulations , because the wmap detector noise is completely negligible for the low order multipoles .",
    "the observed values of the statistics are given for the ilc _ wmap _ 5 years map @xcite .",
    "in the case of a simply - connected universe we do not observe any specific direction in the distribution of the cmb anisotropy . as a consequence , the multipole vectors ( as well the cross products )",
    "are uniformly distributed on the sky ( see [ fig : dist_iso ] ) .",
    "conversely , in the case of a multi - connected universe , if the dimension of the fundamental domain is comparable to the universe s horizon scale , one can see preferred directions in the distribution of the cmb anisotropy on the sky .",
    "corresponding multipole vectors , as well the cross products , also demonstrate non - isotropic distributions .",
    "the structures we observe can be qualitatively explained as follows . for multipoles of order",
    "@xmath1 , the biggest contribution comes from the modes with the wavenumber @xmath53 .",
    "significant contributions will also come from the projection on the sphere of those modes with wavenumbers @xmath54 . because the multipole vectors are not related linearly to the spherical harmonic coefficients and the map of anisotropy ( see appendix [ sec : appendix ] ) , it is hard to predict a priori how they are distributed on the sky in the case of a multiconnected topology .",
    "we can , however , expect that the distribution will somehow reflect the symmetries of the fundamental domain .",
    "the distribution of the multipole vectors on the sky for the t228 and t882 topologies without contribution from the isw effect are shown in [ fig : dist_vec_t228 ] and [ fig : dist_vec_t882 ] , respectively .",
    "the distribution is related to symmetries of the fundamental cell as expected .",
    "it is seen particularly for the t228 topology and multipoles of order @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in the case of the quadrupole",
    ", the vectors prefer directions pointing towards those edges of the rectangular prisms , where the power of the maps is concentrated . for the t228 topology",
    "these are the edges parallel to the xy - plane ( in the upper and lower sides of the rectangular prism ) , for the t882 topology , the edges perpendicular to the xy - plane .",
    "because the multipole vectors for the quadrupole point towards the inflection points of the cmb maps , we can deduce that the points are distributed similarly .",
    "the distribution for higher order multipoles is less related to symmetries of the fundamental cell .",
    "it is more azimuthally symmetric and less concentrated in the directions preferred by the topology than is found for the quadrupole and octopole .",
    "it is worth noticing that the volume of the fundamental cell for the t228 topology is smaller than for the t882 topology .",
    "thus , the non - uniform distribution of the vectors is clearer for the former .",
    "the signatures of the multiconnected topology will be diluted by the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect .",
    "this gives a contribution to the large angular scales .",
    "however since it arises from the evolution of structures close to the observer , it does not contain information about the global properties of the universe .",
    "the influence of the isw effect on the distribution of the multipole vectors is seen in [ fig : dist_vec_t228_isw ] and [ fig : dist_vec_t882_isw ] . in both cases ,",
    "the characteristic pattern in the distribution of vectors is less pronounced than for maps without the isw effect .",
    "the dot products of the vectors for two different multipoles are uniformly distributed .",
    "however , the distribution of their sum does not correspond to the distribution of the sum of @xmath20 independent uniformly distributed random variables , because the multipole vectors corresponding to the same multipole are not statistically independent @xcite .",
    "this is seen in [ fig : vec_iso ] .",
    "the internal correlations of the multipole vectors cause the pdf of the statistic to be narrower than the distribution of the sum of independent variables . moreover , although at first glance the distributions appear gaussian , they are not so .",
    "the kurtosis of the distributions is positive , while the skewness is slightly ( though significantly ) negative for all pairs of multipoles .",
    "deviation from gaussianity is even stronger in the case of universes with a multiconnected topology .    because the pdf of the multipole vector statistics for the multiconnected universes is similar to that for the simply - connected universe for higher order multipoles , for the t228 and t882 topologies",
    "we show only the distributions for those lower order multipoles with the biggest deviation from the pdf of the simply - connected universe .    for the t228 topology",
    "the alignment of the multipole vectors in the direction of the longer side of the prism causes a significant shift of the pdf of the @xmath57 statistic toward higher values ( see [ fig : vec_vec_t228_t228isw_iso ] ) . because cross products of the multipole vectors are orthogonal to the vectors , alignment of the multipole vectors results in the distributions of the @xmath58 and @xmath59 statistics to be shifted toward zero ( see [ fig : vec_cross_t228_t228isw_iso ] and [ fig : cross_vec_t228_t228isw_iso ] ) . on the other hand , alignment of the cross products in the direction of the shorter sides of the prism and in the plane",
    "perpendicular to the longer side means that the distribution of the @xmath60 statistic is slightly moved toward one ( see [ fig : cross_cross_t228_t228isw_iso ] ) .",
    "similar tendencies in the pdf are seen also in case of the t882 topology ( see [ fig : vec_vec_t882_t882isw_iso ] , [ fig : vec_cross_t882_t882isw_iso ] , [ fig : cross_vec_t882_t882isw_iso ] and [ fig : cross_cross_t882_t882isw_iso ] ) .",
    "it can be explained by the alignment of the multipole vectors in the plane spanned by the longer sides and the cross products in the direction of the shorter side .",
    "however , because of the larger volume of the fundamental domain than for the t228 topology and weaker alignment of the vectors , the signatures of the topology are less significant . only in the case of the @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 statistics , for the pair of multipoles of order @xmath55 and @xmath61 ( without contribution from the isw effect ) , does the distribution demonstrate a bigger deviation from the pdf of the simply - connected universe .",
    "it has a pronounced local maximum around one for the @xmath60 statistic ( see [ fig : cross_cross_t882_t882isw_iso ] ) and show some excess close to zero for the @xmath58 and @xmath59 statistics ( see [ fig : vec_cross_t882_t882isw_iso ] and [ fig : cross_vec_t882_t882isw_iso ] ) .",
    "the statistics corresponding to the unnormalised cross products take smaller values in comparison to those with normalised ones , because of the smaller norm of the unnormalised cross products .",
    "it is seen especially well for higher order multipoles .    as in the case of the distribution of the vectors on the sky , the isw effect significantly dilutes the signatures of the topology for all kind of statistics .",
    "for a few pairs of multipoles , especially for @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the observed values of the statistics differ from the predictions for the simply - connected universe substantially . however , not all of them indicate a multiconnected topology .",
    "while correlations for the pairs @xmath62 and @xmath65 prefer one of the topologies under consideration , correlations for the pairs @xmath63 and @xmath64 are in conflict with these models . a quantitative estimation of the goodness of fit of the models to the data",
    "is presented in [ sec : probabilities ] .    to study the dependence of the pdf of the statistics on the dimensions of the fundamental domain , we estimated the pdf also for the 3-toruses t448 and t668 .",
    "the distribution of the statistics for the pair of multipoles @xmath66 without any contribution from the isw effect is shown in [ fig : dist_txx8_sw ] .",
    "it can be seen that traces of a multiconnected topology are substantially degraded for a universe with larger dimensions , and almost completely disappears already for the topology t448 . for the simulations including the isw effect , the statistics are even less sensitive to the dimensions of the fundamental cell .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "before we draw any conclusions from these results , one needs to point out that the probabilities shown in [ tab : prob1 ] and [ tab : prob2 ] are merely an approximation to the true values . because of the limitation imposed on the number of dimensions that we could consider , we did not study the joint probability distribution function defined for more than 4-dimensional space and did not take into account other correlations , clearly visible in [ fig : corr_t228 ] and [ fig : corr_t882 ] , between the statistics .",
    "one needs also to remember that the sets of multipoles pairs considered were selected on the basis of a posteriori knowledge concerning the values of the statistics for the data .",
    "this could also influence our inferences regarding the cmb isotropy .",
    "we have studied signatures of a multiconnected topology of the universe via the distribution of multipole vectors on the sky and the pdf of their statistics .",
    "we considered topologies for a flat universe , where a fundamental domain was a rectangular prism with dimensions @xmath46 , @xmath47 ( elongated case ) and @xmath67 , @xmath68 ( flattened case ) . in both cases ,",
    "only the shortest dimension of the prism is smaller than diameter of the last scattering surface .",
    "unsurprisingly , the distribution of the multipole vectors on the sky , especially for the quadrupole , reflects symmetries of the fundamental cell specific to the topology under consideration .",
    "the multipole vectors are aligned along the longer sides of the fundamental cell , but the alignment is more pronounced for the quadrupole and octopole .",
    "as the isw effect is caused by the evolution of structures close to the observer , it significantly diminishes the evidence of a multiconnected topology , so that the vectors follow instead the distribution of the power on the cmb maps .",
    "for some of the statistics , the joint pdf for a few pairs of the multipoles indicates that the data is better fitted by a model of the universe with a multiconnected topology .",
    "however , one can also find statistics for which certain pairs support the alternative conclusions .",
    "a more quantitative assessment indicates that the data do indeed slightly prefer the multiconnected topology .",
    "nevertheless , the most significant values of the probabilities for the simply - connected universe , i.e.  94% for the statistics with normalised cross products and 97% for the statistics with unnormalised products , show that this hypothesis is not clearly ruled out .",
    "we also found that the multipole vectors statistics are not very sensitive to the signatures of the 3-torus topology if the shorter dimension of the fundamental domain is comparable to the observable diameter of the universe .",
    "these results have a rather preliminary character .",
    "there is a need to carefully evaluate the influence of the contamination from the galactic foreground on detection of the topological signatures .",
    "it is known that the _ wmap _ ilc map used in our studies to some extent is contaminated by foreground residuals .",
    "the maps for the q , v and w - bands with the masked galactic plane and corrected foreground are more credible for the cosmological analysis .",
    "however , application of the mask breaks the statistical isotropy of the maps .",
    "then , we have to consider all possible orientations of the fundamental domain with respect to the mask , which makes the analysis computationally much tougher .",
    "extension of the studies is also seriously limited by the fact that we do not have any analytical expression for the pdf of the multipole vectors statistics even for the simply - connected universe .",
    "so far only the pdf of the multipole vectors for the simply - connected universe was given @xcite .",
    "thus , we had to base our analysis on simulations .",
    "the correlations between different pairs of the statistics present for multi - connected universes introduces the necessity of a multivariate analysis of the joint pdf to allow a correct estimation of the probabilities .",
    "however , using @xmath0 simulations this could only be achieved up to a four dimensional subspace .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for useful suggestions that substantially improved the article and tony banday for a careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "we acknowledge the use of cmbfast @xcite . some of the results in this paper have been derived using the healpix @xcite software and analysis package .",
