    "recently , the cold - atom community has shown renewed interest in soliton dynamics , sparked by the experimental observation of cold - atom solitons in quasi - onedimensional bose - einstein condensates with attractive contact interaction @xcite .",
    "notably , it has been emphasized that the soliton s center of mass is a collective degree of freedom whose dynamics can show genuine quantum effects . in this vein ,",
    "weiss and castin @xcite have calculated the scattering amplitude of a soliton by a potential barrier , which results in a superposition of classically distinct quantum states , namely the soliton being either transmitted or reflected .",
    "similarly , lewenstein and malomed @xcite have proposed to generate entanglement by the controlled collision of quantum solitons .",
    "a well - known paradigm of genuine quantum dynamics is disorder - induced anderson localization @xcite , which has been studied for solitons in different settings some time ago @xcite , and also been observed rather recently with ultracold , noninteracting matter waves @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "motivated by these experimental advances , we have investigated the quantum dynamics of matter - wave solitons in spatially correlated disorder potentials @xcite .",
    "the first part of the present paper reviews briefly the derivation of an effective hamiltonian for the center of mass and the resulting localization exponent in an optical speckle potential .    naturally , there is more to solitons than just their center - of - mass dynamics",
    ". whenever inhomogeneous force fields act on a compound object , the latter responds by adapting its internal configuration as well . for weak forces ,",
    "the response will be linear and thus described by a ( linear ) susceptibility .",
    "the second part of this paper investigates in more detail how the soliton s ground - state shape changes under the influence of a weak external potential .",
    "we calculate the linear compressibility in general , and then focus on the simple , yet interesting case of a lattice potential , including a detailed comparison of analytical results to numerical data .",
    "this allows us finally to derive quantitative criteria for the external perturbation of the shape to be weak .",
    "we describe a weakly interacting bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in a quasi - onedimensional wave guide by its mean - field amplitude @xmath0 .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) free energy functional , with a given chemical potential @xmath1 and in a homogeneous wave guide , reads @xmath2 = \\int { \\mathrm{d}}z \\left\\ { \\frac{1}{2}|\\partial_z\\phi|^2 + \\frac{g}{2}|\\phi|^4 - \\mu |\\phi|^2   \\right\\}.\\ ] ] we will use units such that @xmath3 throughout the following .",
    "@xmath4 is the effective interaction constant for a quasi - onedimensional condensate with s - wave scattering length @xmath5 and transverse harmonic trapping frequency @xmath6 .",
    "the cases of repulsive ( @xmath7 ) and attractive ( @xmath8 ) interaction correspond to @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .    minimizing the free energy @xmath11 yields the ground state @xmath12 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath1 thus determines the total number of particles @xmath13 , with @xmath14 being the condensate density .",
    "let us choose periodic boundary conditions , as for a toroidal wave guide with circumference @xmath15 . in the case of repulsive interaction @xmath9 , both kinetic energy and interaction energy",
    "are mimimized by spreading the density homogeneously over the entire available length : @xmath16 and @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "the corresponding ground - state wave function @xmath19 plays the rle of a bec order parameter , featuring an arbitrary global phase @xmath20 that spontaneously breaks the @xmath21 gauge invariance of . for the ground state of a single bose - einstein condensate , we can set @xmath22 .",
    "an attractive interaction @xmath10 rather favors a state where atoms are clustered together . as shown by kanamoto et al .",

    "the number of particles is now @xmath26 .",
    "conversely , in a canonical setting with fixed number of particles @xmath27 , the chemical potential settles to @xmath28 .",
    "note that the solution spontaneously breaks not only the gauge invariance with a phase @xmath20 ( that we take to be zero ) , but also the translational invariance of the energy functional .",
    "therefore , the center of mass @xmath29 emerges as a dynamical degree of freedom on its own . in the homogeneous situation described by ,",
    "all classical solutions @xmath30 with constant velocity @xmath31 are admissible by galilean invariance . in a given frame of reference ,",
    "the classical configuration with minimum kinetic energy is a soliton resting at @xmath32 .",
    "quantum mechanically , however , @xmath33 is rather distributed with its ground - state wave function @xmath34 that obeys the free schrdinger equation under the given boundary conditions . for periodic boundary conditions , this center - of - mass ground state is the completely delocalized plane wave with momentum @xmath35 , i.e. the constant @xmath36 .",
    "contrary to the point of view that the `` wave properties of solitons manifest themselves in radiation emitted due to scattering by impurities '' @xcite , we take a more general approach along the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics , namely that wave - particle duality is a general feature of all degrees of freedom , to be revealed under appropriate experimental circumstances",
    ".    it may seem peculiar to speak of quantum dynamics for the center of mass of a whole collection of atoms , after starting out from a mean - field description for the entire condensate .",
    "but it is indeed very common to separate the center of mass from internal variables in interacting systems and moreover exact for two - body forces that only depend on the relative distance between the microscopic constituents .",
    "the situation of a soliton , composed of individual atoms held together by attractive contact interactions , is therefore analogous to the situation of , say , an alkali atom composed of a nucleus and electrons held together by the coulomb force .",
    "and just as one may study the quantum dynamics of entire atoms not to mention fullerenes or biomolecules @xcite  one may indeed equally well study the quantum dynamics of entire solitons as far as their center of mass is concerned .",

    "to lowest order in @xmath39 , therefore , the shape of the original soliton will remain unchanged .",
    "in contrast , the external potential can never be considered a small perturbation for the center - of - mass dynamics because a finite @xmath40 is never small compared to the homogeneous case @xmath41 .",
    "at this point , the paper bifurcates . in the following section , we focus on the center of mass .",
    "we highlight the quantumness of its dynamics in a disordered potential by discussing the anderson localization length , as first derived in @xcite . as a complement to this work",
    ", we will study in sections [ linearresponse.sec ] and [ lattice.sec ] below how the soliton s shape is modified by the presence of a weak external potential in the mean - field ground state .",
    "section [ conclusion.sec ] concludes .",
    "assuming a fixed soliton shape , the center of mass @xmath33 of @xmath27 particles can be described as a collective variable with the ansatz @xmath42 . here",
    ", the conjugate momentum @xmath43 appears in the phase together with a factor @xmath44 because @xmath45 , eq .",
    ", is normalized to @xmath46 . inserting this collective - variable ansatz in the energy functional and integrating over @xmath47 yields the effective hamiltonian @xmath48 this hamiltonian describes a particle with mass @xmath27 evolving in a potential @xmath49 that is the convolution of the bare potential with the soliton envelope .",
    "if the bare potential varies only very slowly over one healing length @xmath50 , then the soliton feels the sum of forces on its constituents , @xmath51 .",
    "if on the other hand the potential varies rather rapidly , then the convolution by the soliton density washes out all details on scales smaller than @xmath52 , and the effective potential is strongly reduced .",
    "this is easily illustrated with a lattice potential @xmath53 , for which the effective potential is essentially the fourier transform of the soliton density @xmath54 of : @xmath55 indeed , @xmath56 as @xmath57 , and for @xmath58 , the amplitude @xmath59 becomes exponentially small .",
    "a disorder potential is a random process @xmath37 characterized by its moments @xmath60 , @xmath61 , etc .",
    "statistically homogeneous disorder is translation invariant after averaging , with @xmath62 , @xmath63 , etc . without loss of generality , one can always set @xmath64 by redefining the zero of energy or shifting @xmath65 in .",
    "thus , the most basic information about the disorder potential is its pair correlator @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the variance characterizing the overall strength of disorder .",
    "the spatial correlation function @xmath68 decreases from @xmath69 to zero over a characteristic length scale @xmath70 , the correlation length of the disorder .",
    "equivalently , a disordered potential can be seen as a random superposition of plane - wave components @xmath71 . statistical homogeneity then translates into conservation of total momentum under averaging : @xmath72 , where the so - called power spectrum @xmath73 is the fourier transform of the real - space correlator @xmath68 .    for the present case of cold - atom dynamics",
    ", we consider in detail optical speckle potentials @xcite for which the laws of optics result in a remarkably simple correlation : @xmath74 ^ 2 $ ] or @xmath75 the correlation length @xmath70 is determined by the wave length of the laser light and the geometric aperture of the imaging system and can be as short as @xmath76 m @xcite .",
    "the heaviside distribution @xmath77 in excludes all wave vectors with modulus larger than @xmath78 , as required by the limit of optical resolution .",
    "the effective potential felt by the soliton s center of mass is the convolution of the bare potential by the soliton density . by virtue of the convolution theorem ,",
    "the fourier components of the effective potential are therefore the product of the bare components times the fourier components of the density , which already appeared in : @xmath79    the statistical properties of the potential affecting the soliton s center of mass are therefore completely determined and readily expressed in fourier components .",
    "for example , the effective power spectrum reads @xmath80 if the potential is very smooth on the soliton scale @xmath52 , i.e. has a correlation length @xmath81 , the power spectrum @xmath73 goes to zero faster than the soliton fourier envelope , and @xmath82 .",
    "conversely , if the bare potential is varying very rapidly , @xmath83 , the bare spectrum can be approximated in the range @xmath84 by its delta - correlation limit @xmath85 .",
    "then , the healing length @xmath52 takes over as the new correlation length with an exponential decay of potential fluctuations as @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the free soliton , @xmath88 , has the plane - wave eigenfunctions @xmath89 .",
    "when a small disorder potential is switched on , these extended plane - wave states become exponentially localized .",
    "mathematically rigorous theorems assure that in 1d , the logarithmically averaged eigenfunctions decay for large distances @xmath33 from their origin like @xcite @xmath90 the corresponding localization exponent , or inverse localization length , @xmath91 can be calculated perturbatively ( for generic values of @xmath92 , i.e. , away from the band center @xmath93 or other singular points ) in powers of the strength of the disorder potential . to second order in @xmath94 ,",
    "in the so - called born approximation , the localization exponent reads @xmath95 , with @xmath96 the free kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "the potential correlator is evaluated at momentum @xmath97 since it is the elementary backscattering process @xmath98 that is eventually responsible for anderson localization in 1d .     versus its center - of - mass wave vector @xmath92 , in units of the soliton width @xmath52 .",
    "circles are numerical results obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian and solid lines are the result of a transfer - matrix calculation @xcite , for a red- and blue - detuned speckle potential with @xmath99 , respectively , and a correlation length @xmath100 m .",
    "the born approximation , eq .",
    ", is shown as a dashed line .",
    "the overall exponential decrease for @xmath87 and @xmath84 is clearly visible . ]    for the soliton , we have @xmath101 and scattering by the effective potential @xmath102 , such that the localization exponent is predicted to be @xmath103 figure [ gammak.fig ] shows this prediction , together with numerical data , obtained both by exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian and a transfer matrix approach , respectively @xcite .",
    "we have chosen realistic experimental parameters : @xmath104 @xmath105li atoms with scattering length @xmath106 nm in a transverse trap with @xmath107khz form a soliton of size @xmath108m@xmath109 m .",
    "we consider an optical speckle potential with amplitude @xmath110 , i.e. both the red - detuned case with @xmath111 and the blue - detuned case with @xmath112 .",
    "since the speckle potential has a non - gaussian , skewed distribution , the full localization exponent depends on the absolute sign of @xmath94 , an effect that the lowest - order born approximation @xmath113 can not capture . however , the overall exponential decrease for @xmath114 is correctly predicted .",
    "these results show that the localization length , @xmath115 , of not - too - fast solitons with @xmath116 is in the sub - mm range that is measurable in current experiments on localization of non - interacting matter waves @xcite .",
    "further results can be found in @xcite , such as the expected density distribution of the final soliton position , depending on initial trapping conditions .",
    "but what about the emission of radiation due to scattering by impurities , as discussed at length by gredeskul and kivshar @xcite and others ?",
    "it is important to realize that we specifically focus on smooth , spatially correlated potentials that are expected to provoke considerably less excitation than isolated , @xmath117-like impurities .",
    "nonetheless , it is clearly important to know the precise effects of the external disorder on the soliton shape .",
    "some light on this issue will be shed in the following sections .",
    "the previous results on the disorder - induced localization of a soliton have been derived with the effective hamiltonian as the only ingredient . there , the soliton shape was assumed to be completely unaffected by the external potential . although @xmath118 is probably a sufficient condition for this to be valid @xcite , as such it can not be a satisfying , namely necessary criterion . indeed , a potential with a large amplitude @xmath119 but fluctuating only on very long length scales hardly deformes the soliton if its variation over the soliton size , @xmath120 , is very small .",
    "conversely , the amplitude of an interacting condensate can not follow very rapid potential oscillations with a wavelength much smaller than @xmath52 since this would cost too much kinetic energy in . in this case , only strongly smoothed fluctuations are expected to appear , just as in the repulsive case @xcite . in order to sharpen the picture , we therefore set out to compute the mean - field soliton deformation as function of the potential s amplitude and wave vector .",
    "a small deformation of the ground state can be described by an expansion over a complete set of elementary excitations , such as described by bogoliubov theory . in general , the bogoliubov theory of condensate excitations in inhomogeneous potentials can be formulated as a saddle - point expansion of the mean - field energy functional @xcite and comprises two important steps : in a first step , the deformed ground state is determined as a functional of the external potential . in a second step ,",
    "the quadratic excitations around this deformed ground state are determined . in order to arrive at meaningful results with all effects to a given order of @xmath40 taken properly into account ,",
    "the first step is a vital prerequisite for carrying out the second . in the present contribution",
    ", we shall content ourselves with taking step 1 , the consistent calculation of the mean - field ground state deformation caused by a weak , but otherwise arbitrary , external potential @xmath37 .    for the repulsive case with its homogeneous ground - state density @xmath121",
    ", such a linear response to an external inhomogeneous potential can be computed rather easily , taking advantage of fourier decomposition ; for applications to disordered potentials see , e.g. , the work of giorgini et al .",

    "in other words , this mode appears as a zero - energy eigenmode of the linear response kernel @xcite .",

    "[ lattice_coeffs.sec ] above , the linear response becomes increasingly accurate for larger @xmath92 vectors , as the deformation itself becomes very small .",
    "the last set of data shows an almost pure sinusoidal deformation .",
    "indeed , in the limit @xmath242 , one can extract the leading contribution of by partial integration and finds @xmath243 up to higher orders in @xmath244 .",
    "in this article , we elaborate on two important aspects of bright cold - atom solitons in inhomogeneous external potentials .",
    "firstly , we discuss the quantum dynamics of the soliton s center of mass in a disordered , spatially correlated potential .",
    "the center - of - mass wave function is predicted to show anderson localization with a localization length that can be estimated using the born approximation of perturbation theory and is shown to be in an experimentally relevant range .",
    "secondly , we calculate the imprint of a weak external potential on the soliton mean - field shape in the ground state . for this",
    ", we determine the linear - response kernel , both for the wave function and the local density , as well as the chemical potential shift .",
    "amusingly , this can be done rather easily using the supersymmetric quantum mechanics of the pschl - teller or @xmath143-potential well .",
    "finally , a detailed comparison to the numerically calculated ground - state solution is presented for a pure lattice potential with amplitude @xmath94 and wave vector @xmath92 .",
    "the small parameter of the linear response is @xmath207 in the regime @xmath245 of a potential varying on the scale of the soliton width . in the limit @xmath246 ,",
    "one recovers the case of harmonic confinement , studied recently by castin @xcite . here",
    ", the small parameter for the soliton deformation is @xmath247 in terms of the harmonic trapping frequency @xmath248 . in the smoothing limit @xmath114 of a rapidly fluctuating potential",
    ", the condensate amplitude shows a pure sinusoidal imprint , the small parameter being @xmath249 .    until now",
    ", we have discussed the center - of - mass quantum dynamics for fixed shape on the one hand , and the static properties of the mean - field ground state shape on the other . from the latter",
    ", we have learned that the impact on the soliton shape is indeed small for small @xmath207 . in other words ,",
    "the external potential can not easily excite the internal modes since these have a gapped spectrum .",
    "therefore , whenever the soliton moves slowly within a smooth potential , it is slightly polarized , but only adiabatically and reversibly ( just as , say , an alkali atom is polarized in an optical dipole potential ) .",
    "therefore , we can expect the center - of - mass quantum dynamcis to be unharmed by shape excitations as long as the gap @xmath250 remains large compare to all other energies .",
    "it must be kept in mind , however , that anderson localization is an interference effect relying on perfect phase coherence , at least over the time and distance needed to observe it .",
    "already very small decoherence can kill this effect . for cold - atom solitons ,",
    "the most dangerous sources of decoherence arguably are scattering of background - gas atoms ( cf .  the analogous case of fullerenes @xcite ) and three - body collisions , both of which can in principle be minimized in the experiment .",
    "however , if the movement of a soliton inside a disordered potential were to radiate permanent excitations , as discussed for the case of isolated point impurities in @xcite , then this would constitute an intrinsic source of decoherence .",
    "the detailed study of such effects , well beyond the simple mean - field estimate for the ground state presented here , is left for future research .",
