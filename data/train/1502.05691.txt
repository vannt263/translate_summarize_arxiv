    "the squid is the most sensitive instrument which is capable of detecting and measuring even extremely small magnetic fields .",
    "it has been used successfully not only for magnetometry but also for voltage and current measurements .",
    "its applications go far beyond the research laboratories often into commercial apparatus exploited in metrology , geophysics and medicine , see the reviews @xcite .",
    "the squid has been the topic of various extensive theoretical and experimental studies . yet , a number of open problems of this setup still remain to be resolved .",
    "a prominent example may be the efficiency of the squid as a thermodynamical machine converting the input energy into its other forms .",
    "it is the subject of this paper .",
    "we study an asymmetric squid driven by an external current and analyze the charge transport and voltage induced across the device .",
    "the asymmetric squid is modeled as a ratchet far from equilibrium , i.e. as a classical brownian particle moving in a spatially periodic potential with broken reflection symmetry and driven by a time - dependent force . in this mechanical analogy",
    ", the voltage across the squid corresponds to the particle velocity .",
    "the most basic measure for characterizing the motion of the brownian particle is its long time average velocity @xmath0 .",
    "however , alone it does not give any information on quality of transport process .",
    "is it effective or ineffective ? to answer this question ,",
    "we need to consider its other attributes . one of them are _ fluctuations _ of the velocity around its average value which in the long time regime are represented by the variance @xmath1 .",
    "then , typically the instantaneous velocity @xmath2 takes values within the interval of standard deviation , @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "note that if fluctuations are large , i.e. if @xmath4 , then it is possible that the particle moves for some time in the direction opposite to its average velocity @xmath0 , spread of velocities is large and overall transport is not effective .",
    "the next feature which is important in answering the question about the quality of transport phenomenon is related to the ratio of energy input into the system and its energetic output .",
    "how much of the energy input is converted into directed motion of the particle and how much of it is wasted by spreading out into environment and dissipated as heat ? a proper quantifier to characterize this aspect of transport is the _ efficiency _ of the system .    by using the correspondence between the squid and the mechanical ratchet system , we study three measures for evaluation of transport quality : average voltage , its fluctuations and the efficiency of the squid . in the previous paper @xcite we analyzed the average voltage in this setup for wide parameter regimes : covering the overdamped to moderate damping regime up to its fully underdamped regime .",
    "we found the intriguing features of a negative absolute and differential conductance , repeated voltage reversals , noise induced voltage reversals and solely thermal noise - induced ratchet voltage .",
    "we identified a set of parameters for which the ratchet effect is most pronounced and showed how the direction of transport can be controlled by tailoring the external magnetic flux .",
    "the main emphasis of that work laid on formulating and exploring conditions that are necessary for the generation and control of transport @xcite , its direction , magnitude as well as its dependence on system parameters .",
    "however , apart from these well investigated questions other important features concerning the quality of transport @xcite have remained unanswered . therefore in this paper",
    "we concentrate on this topic and connection between the directed transport expressed in terms of the dc voltage , its fluctuation characteristics and energetics of the squid .",
    "theoretical aspects considered in the paper concern not only our specific squid ratchet but a much wider class of systems and problems .",
    "there are many experiments on a number of ratchet systems @xcite , in particular superconducting ratchets @xcite , a part of which can be controlled by an external magnetic field @xcite as well as theoretical studies of such systems driven by harmonic and biharmonic external currents @xcite .",
    "however , the efficiency of transport has not been analyzed in the above - cited papers .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we recall the model of a squid rocking ratchet which is composed of three resistively and capacitively shunted josephson junctions . in sec .",
    "iii we define mean values of arbitrary state functions in the long time regime . then in secs .",
    "iv - vi , the quantities characterizing the quality of the transport such as the voltage fluctuations , the energy balance and the ( stokes ) efficiency are introduced , respectively . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we elaborate on key aspects of transport efficiency in the system : starting from the power delivered by the externally applied current , covering the tailoring of the stokes efficiency of the device , up to presentation of the regime for which thermal noise enhances the efficiency and discussion about the impact of variation of the external magnetic flux on the efficiency of the squid .",
    "finally , the last section provides a summary .    , the externally applied current is @xmath5 , the current through the left and right arms is @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the external magnetic flux is @xmath8 and the instantaneous voltage across the squid is @xmath9 . the long time average voltage @xmath10 across the squid",
    "is expressed by the relation @xmath11 . ]",
    "the asymmetric squid @xcite is presented in fig .",
    "1 . it is a loop with two resistively and capacitively shunted josephson junctions @xcite in the left arm and one in the right arm .",
    "the crosses denote the junctions and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) are the phase differences across them .",
    "each junction is characterized by the capacitance @xmath14 , resistance @xmath15 and critical josephson supercurrent @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the squid is threaded by an external magnetic flux @xmath8 and driven by an external current @xmath17 which is composed of the static dc current @xmath18 and the ac component of amplitude @xmath19 and angular frequency @xmath20 , namely @xmath21 to reduce a number of parameters of the model , we consider a special case when two junctions in the left arm are identical , i.e. @xmath22 . in some regimes",
    "@xcite , two junctions in a series can be considered as one for which the supercurrent - phase relation takes the form @xmath23 , where @xmath24 .",
    "this result is also derived in ref .",
    "@xcite for an effective double - well structure described in terms of a double - barrier potential ( cf .",

    "it is important to note that the friction @xmath51 is not proportional to the normal resistance @xmath53 ( as one could expect in the case of electrical circuits ) but to the inverse of @xmath53 .",
    "the reason is that plasma oscillations of the junction are more damped if more normal electrons couple to the oscillating condensate ( i.e. when @xmath54 is greater ) .",
    "the voltage accelerates normal electrons and their kinetic energy is dissipated into heat . thus the plasma oscillations converts into heat with a rate proportional to the conductance @xmath54 @xcite .",

    "\\label{e2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the above equation it follows that the amount of the energy input to the squid from the external driving @xmath48 depends not only on the current itself ( i.e. on @xmath103 ) but also on properties and parameters of the device : its temperature @xmath38 , the resistance @xmath53 and the capacitance @xmath88 .",
    "in contrast , the energy supplied by thermal fluctuations does not depend on the external current but only on @xmath104 and @xmath88 .",
    "a generic definition of the efficiency of a device converting energy is a ratio between the output ( work , power ) and the input ( power ) energy .",
    "depending on the choice of input and output , different definitions of the efficiency characterize various aspects of energy conversion in the device .",
    "to explain the problem , we use the mechanical interpretation of ( [ lang1 ] )",
    ". then the average voltage @xmath10 corresponds to the velocity of the brownian particle or the _ brownian motor_. the thermodynamic efficiency is defined as a ratio of the work done by the motor to the energy input . if the particle is working against a constant force ( load ) @xmath105 then in stationary state the efficiency is defined as follows @xmath106 in the considered case , there is no a load and the brownian motor does not transport external objects .",
    "it works against the friction `` force '' @xmath107 ( by the way , it has not the unit of newton but if the above formula is again multiplied by the factor @xmath108 then it has the correct physical unit . )",
    "when the external force @xmath48 is switched off , the velocity of the motor is damped to zero and the system tends to thermodynamical equilibrium . because the motor works against the friction force , we can utilize its mean value to get another definition of efficiency , namely @xmath109 this quantity is called the _ stokes efficiency _ @xcite .",
    "let us note that it depends explicitly on mass @xmath88 of the brownian particle and and only implicitly on the friction coefficient @xmath53 via the langevin equation ( [ lang1 ] )",
    ".    it should be mentioned that ( [ eff2 ] ) is not the rate of the work done by the motor on its surroundings ( viscous medium ) .",
    "moreover , it is not a mean power @xmath110 to overcome the friction force which correct form reads @xmath111 however , this expression can not be put as a numerator in the definition of the efficiency because there are regimes where the mean velocity is extremely small ( numerically zero ) , @xmath112 but @xmath113 and the efficiency could be large even though the particle does not move on average in one direction .",
    "it is the main reason why the stokes efficiency is more adequate is such cases as considered in the paper .",
    "another possible definition of the efficiency is based on the remark that what we observe in the long time regime is the average velocity .",
    "therefore we can introduce `` kinetic power '' as the `` kinetic energy '' of the particle per the period @xmath38 , @xmath114 one should note that it is not exactly proper definition of the kinetic power as it should be proportional to @xmath115 instead of @xmath116 . however , we replaced it with the latter for the reason explained before",
    ". nevertheless , it is still a measure of performance of the motor . if the average velocity increases then @xmath117 also grows .",
    "we can insert it as a numerator in ( [ eff1 ] ) and then we get the _ kinetic efficiency _ @xmath118 this quantifier can be used only when the time - periodic force is switched on . then qualitatively , it is similar to the stokes efficiency .",
    "however , the dependence on the mass @xmath88 , the friction coefficient @xmath53 and the period @xmath38 is different .",
    "both the stokes efficiency and the kinetic efficiency are consistent with our intuition : a decrease of fluctuations @xmath119 leads to a smaller input power and hence to an increase of the efficiency .",
    "consequently , the transport is optimized in regimes that _ maximize _ the directed velocity and _ minimize _ its fluctuations . because the kinetic efficiency is proportional to the stokes efficiency , below we analyze only the last one .",
    "there are several dimensionless forms of eq .",

    "the system described by ( [ eq29 ] ) becomes deterministic when the thermal noise intensity @xmath155 is set to zero . even in this case",
    "it exhibits complex dynamics including chaotic regimes @xcite .",
    "the application of noise generally smooths out its characteristic response function .",
    "there are two classes of states of the driven system dynamics : the locked states , in which the phase stays inside finite number of potential wells and the running states for which it runs over the potential barriers .",
    "the latter are crucial for the occurrence of the transport",
    ". they can be either chaotic ( diffusive ) or regular .",
    "the fokker - planck equation ( [ fp ] ) corresponding to the langevin equation ( [ lang1 ] ) can not be solved by use of closed analytical forms .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain the relevant transport characteristics we have to resort to comprehensive numerical simulations of the driven langevin dynamics .",

    "plateaus correspond to standard shapiro steps @xcite .",
    "however , in our case also steps at half integer multiplies of @xmath165 can be observed .",
    "this is due to the deviation of @xmath128 from a simple @xmath189 form , which is the sole case for which steps lie only at integer values of @xmath190 @xcite .",
    "however , in both the symmetric and asymmetric cases a proper amount of noise is sufficient to wipe out their evident structure @xcite .",
    "this shapiro - like current - voltage curve is characteristic for the device operating in the low temperature limit of overdamped or damped regimes .",
    "panel ( b ) of the same fig .",
    "5 presents the dependence of the voltage fluctuations @xmath186 on the dc current @xmath163 .",
    "it is rather complicated non - linear and non - monotonic function of @xmath163 without any immediately obvious relation to the average voltage of panel ( a ) .",
    "however , the most important observation is that the voltage fluctuations are minimal for @xmath191 .",
    "this fact is of fundamental importance for the influence of @xmath163 on @xmath183 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) we can see that @xmath183 is locally maximal for @xmath191 . for large values of @xmath163 ( not shown here ) the mean voltage is an almost linear function of @xmath163 and the efficiency approaches the value 1 .",
    "it support the statement in ref .",
    "@xcite that when the stokes efficiency is close to @xmath192 , the driving resembles the constant force .",
    "the role of the frequency @xmath165 of the ac current is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4](d)-(f ) .",
    "panel ( d ) presents the dependence of the average voltage @xmath0 on @xmath165 . in the adiabatic limit @xmath193 it undergoes rapid oscillations",
    "this behavior has its reflection in the influence of the frequency on the voltage fluctuations @xmath186 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4](e ) ) .",
    "according to the previous statement very fast oscillations of the driving current can not induce the non - zero average voltage .",
    "therefore for sufficiently high frequency there is no transport and as a consequence the stokes efficiency @xmath183 is zero .",
    "however , a strong peak of efficiency is observed for moderate value of @xmath194 .",
    "it is associated with the fact that for this frequency the average voltage @xmath0 is maximal and simultaneously its fluctuations @xmath186 are minimal .",
    "the impact of the amplitude @xmath164 of the ac current is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](g)-(i ) , respectively .",
    "in particular , the resonance - like behavior is observed in the dependence of the average voltage @xmath0 on the amplitude @xmath164 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4](g ) ) .",
    "apart from two clearly visible peaks there is almost imperceptible small directed transport .",
    "this fact has critical impact on the functional dependence of the efficiency @xmath183 .",

    "the influence of variation of the amplitude @xmath164 on the voltage fluctuations @xmath186 is depicted in panel ( h ) .",
    "it is almost linearly increasing function of @xmath164 .",
    "only one evident deviation from this trend can be noted , i.e. a local minimum around @xmath196 corresponding to the first high peak in fig . [ fig4](g ) . it should be stressed that there is no any contradiction with the dependence of the average voltage since @xmath170 does not necessarily mean @xmath197 and therefore @xmath186 can at the same time assume nonzero value .",
    "the dependence of all relevant transport characteristics on the capacitance @xmath166 is very complicated as shown in fig . [",
    "fig4](j)-(l ) .",
    "the first panel of this group shows the average voltage versus the capacitance @xmath166 .",
    "we note the important feature of the voltage reversal @xcite : starting from zero , the voltage changes its sign from positive to negative and again in the opposite direction as @xmath166 grows .",
    "therefore the capacitance can serve as a parameter to manipulate the direction of transport processes .",
    "the efficiency @xmath183 is maximal close to the border between the overdamped and damped regimes .",
    "it is ( almost ) zero in the underdamped limit which corresponds to large capacitance @xmath181 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that for this regime the average voltage @xmath0 vanishes or is negligibly small .",
    "the last three panels of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] depict the influence of the thermal noise intensity @xmath155 on all previously studied quantities .",
    "an increase of the noise intensity @xmath155 leads to both monotonic decrease of the induced average voltage @xmath0 and increase of its fluctuations @xmath186 .",
    "consequently , the efficiency is the best in the low temperature regime when the deterministic dynamics of the system ( [ eq29 ] ) plays a crucial role .",
    "we have found the opposite scenario when thermal noise enhances the efficiency .",
    "this perhaps surprising effect is exemplified in fig .",
    "panel ( c ) presents the dependence of the efficiency @xmath183 on @xmath155 .",
    "evidently , in some intervals of @xmath155 , the increase of temperature causes the increase of @xmath183 .",
    "there is also optimal value of temperature or equivalently the thermal noise intensity @xmath198 for which the efficiency takes its maximum .",
    "moreover , in this case the ratchet mechanism is solely activated by thermal equilibrium fluctuations as for low noise intensity no rectification can be observed .",
    "this statement is confirmed in the functional dependence of the average voltage @xmath0 which is presented in panel ( a ) .",
    "it is also remarkable that in this regime an increase of thermal noise intensity @xmath155 leads to a decrease of voltage fluctuations @xmath186 .",
    "as it was shown before , the efficiency can be tuned in several ways .",
    "however , it seems that from the experimental point of view the simplest method is to vary the external constant magnetic flux @xmath168 .",
    "the dependence of the average voltage @xmath0 , its fluctuations @xmath186 and the efficiency on the external magnetic flux @xmath168 in the previously presented regime for which thermal noise induces the ratchet effect ( cf .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . from the symmetry considerations of ( [ eq29 ] )",
    "it follows that for an arbitrary integer number @xmath199 , the transformation @xmath200 reverses the sign of the average voltage @xmath201 .",
    "this fact can be directly observed in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . however , this is not the case for the voltage fluctuations @xmath186 , where they are symmetric around @xmath169 .",
    "a careful inspection of panel ( b ) reveals that one can reduce magnitude of @xmath186 by nearly two times just by correct adjustment of the external magnetic flux .",
    "this fact has further consequences in the dependence of the efficiency which is depicted in panel ( c ) .",
    "it can be slightly tuned by a small variation of the external magnetic flux .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we present how the stokes efficiency behaves in the parameter plane @xmath202 that specifies the form of the spatially periodic potential @xmath128 . for",
    "both sufficiently small and large @xmath203 it vanishes completely .",
    "one can observe that for a given external magnetic flux @xmath168 the stokes efficiency generally tends to increase as the parameter @xmath203 grows .",
    "on the contrary , for a given @xmath203 there is an optimal value of the external magnetic flux @xmath168 for which the stokes efficiency is maximal .",
    "we note that for two presented regimes , the set structure of the non - zero efficiency in the parameters plane @xmath202 is radically different .",
    "the left panel looks like butterfly wings and the right is similar to a rocking horse .    .",
    "the left panel corresponds to the optimal regime as in fig .",

    "in this paper , we comprehensively studied the stokes efficiency of the asymmetric squid in the case of the non - zero capacitance of all josephson junctions and in presence of thermal noise .",
    "it allowed to analyze transport properties in the system for the entire scale of regimes : starting from overdamped , by damped and finally underdamped one .",
    "we focused on the connection between the directed transport characterized by the voltage across the squid and its efficiency .",
    "in particular , we examined voltage fluctuations and energetic performance of the device .",
    "we derived the expression for the power delivered by externally applied current and discuss its dependence on the system parameters .",
    "apart from the expected influence of the current parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 it also depends on the thermal noise intensity @xmath155 , i.e. on temperature of the system .",
    "we have found that regions of low efficiency of the squid dominates in the parameter space .",
    "however , we have identified remarkable and distinct regimes of high efficiency @xmath205 .",
    "it turns out that the device operates best in the overdamped or close to damped regimes .",
    "moreover , with the help of the computational power of modern gpu supercomputers we have identified the tailored set of parameters for which the efficiency @xmath183 is globally maximal and for this regime we discussed impact of variation of almost all system parameters on the relevant transport quantities .",
    "in particular , it follows that thermal fluctuations often have destructive influence on the energetic performance of the device .",
    "moreover , we were able to detect also the regime for which thermal noise enhances the efficiency by inducing the large average voltage and minimizing its variance .",
    "last but not least , we discussed in detail the impact of the external magnetic flux @xmath168 on the performance and effectiveness of the squid .",
    "our results can readily be experimentally verified with an accessible setup consisting of three resistively and capacitively shunted josephson junctions formed in an asymmetric squid device .",
    "some partial transport characteristics like voltage have been experimentally studied in the overdamped regime @xcite .",
    "however , the underdamped regime has not been tested and the efficiency has not been measured which makes our study a challenge for experimentalists .",
