    "among the various experimental studies of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions operates the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , at brookhaven national laboratory since 2000 , to investigate gold - on - gold collisions up to @xmath2 .",
    "after many years of operation strong experimental evidence has been accumulated that at rhic energies indeed a new state of matter is created that is qualitatively different from a hadron gas ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this state seems , however , not to behave like a weakly interacting gas of deconfined partons  as could have been naively expected  but rather like a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) .",
    "one argument toward such a scenario is the large elliptic flow observed at rhic @xcite .",
    "the development of strong elliptic flow requires short equilibration times and large pressure gradients to drive the dynamics , both being characteristic features of a strongly interacting system @xcite .",
    "another evidence for this picture is provided by the hadron species dependence of the elliptic flow @xcite . the observed scaling with the number of constituent quarks",
    "can naturally be explained by the assumption that the elliptic flow is to most extent already created in the partonic phase and transferred to the hadrons through a partonic recombination mechanism @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we demonstrate that not only the size but also the shape of the observed pseudorapidity profiles of the elliptic flow @xmath1 provide strong evidence for a partonic recombination mechanism in combination with fast thermal equilibration inside a sqgp phase . as basis for these investigations serves a microscopic quark - gluon string model ( qgsm ) that has been extended to allow for a partonic recombination procedure motivated by parton coalescence models @xcite , i.e. , to model effectively the dynamics of a strongly coupled quark plasma formed in the very dense stages of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collision . by construction",
    ", string cascade models do not contain an explicit quark - hadron phase transition .",
    "however , during the temporal evolution of a heavy - ion reaction a dense and strongly interacting plasma is formed within such approaches as well .",
    "the system consists of partons and color - flux tubes ( or strings ) .",
    "thus , such models can serve as starting base to study the dynamics of the dense and strongly interacting medium created at rhic , in particular because transverse as well as elliptic flow at sps energies are well reproduced within the string - cascade approach @xcite .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the standard version of the microscopic quark - gluon string cascade model ( qgsm ) is able to describe fairly well the bulk properties of the elliptic flow @xmath1 measured in @xmath4 au+au reactions at rhic .",
    "however , a difference in shape in particular between the pseudorapidity distributions of the elliptic flow at midrapidity determined in the experiment and in the simulation has rankled .",
    "the shape of the @xmath1 distributions have been found to be closely related to anisotropies in the corresponding energy density profiles and the degree of equilibration @xcite .",
    "although the system reaches quickly some sort of a pre - equilibrium stage within standard qgsm the processes included are not sufficient to drive the system to a completely thermalized state . as shown in the following , this changes dramatically when partonic recombination processes are included .",
    "the final consequences for the anisotropic flow turned out to be even more remarkable .",
    "the _ standard _ monte carlo version of the quark - gluon string model @xcite that serves as the basis for the present investigations has been described in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite . based on gribov - regge theory ,",
    "the production of hadrons is described by excitation and decay of open strings with different quarks or diquarks on their ends . in that sense",
    "the model already incorporates the partonic structure of hadrons and therefore can provide a framework for the inclusion of partonic recombination processes . to trigger these processes ,",
    "a certain critical ( energy ) density is needed to allow the hadrons to overlap .",
    "concerning the implementation of partonic recombination processes we apply essentially the method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite : the partons of three hadrons are allowed to enter into a recombination process if their spatial distance , in the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) frame of the corresponding hadrons , is less than @xmath5 . from all possible triplets of hadrons satisfying these spatial constraints one",
    "is randomly chosen according to usual monte carlo methods and the corresponding hadrons are then decomposed into their constituent partons ( quark - antiquark or quark - diquark ) .",
    "each parton is given a momentum fraction @xmath6 of the initial momentum of its hadron and , additionally , the partons of each pair obtain a transverse momentum @xmath7 of opposite sign .",
    "both , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are generated from the standard parton distribution functions used within qgsm .",
    "the ( random ) selection of a triplet of hadrons by the coordinate space criterion @xmath8 is based on the approximation that distances of hadrons are equal to ( averaged ) distances of their constituent partons . in that sense",
    "the selection procedure really acts on the partonic level .",
    "the recombination process itself requires also an overlap of the participating partons in momentum space .",
    "the distance in momentum space between the pairs of partons is evaluated in the center - of - mass frame . the probability for recombination of two partons",
    "is then given by the covariant distribution @xcite @xmath9\\nonumber\\\\    & & \\hspace{-1.8cm}\\times\\,\\theta\\left[\\delta_p^2-(p_1-p_2)_{\\rm c.m.}^2\\right]~. \\label{probdist2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] additionally , if the partons of three mesons participate , recombination of three quarks and three antiquarks is possible with a probability distribution @xcite @xmath10\\nonumber\\\\    & & \\hspace{-1.8cm}\\times\\,\\theta\\left[\\delta_p^2-(p_1-p_2)_{\\rm c.m.}^2\\right]\\nonumber\\\\    & & \\hspace{-1.8cm}\\times\\,\\frac{9\\,\\pi}{2\\delta_x^3\\delta_p^3}\\ ,    \\theta\\left[\\delta_x^2-(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}-x_3)_{\\rm",

    "@xcite , where a quark rearrangement model for @xmath11 annihilation to three mesons ( pseudoscalar and vector , which later decay to additional pions ) has been employed . for example : the fusion of two @xmath12 mesons and a pion into @xmath13 is kinematically favored compared to the fusion of three pions ( phase space ) . however , a more quantitative investigation has to be delayed to future work .",
    "the momentum coalescence radius @xmath14 , which enters in the distributions ( [ probdist2 ] ) and ( [ probdist3 ] ) , is given by the uncertainty principle @xmath15 , where the actual distance between the participating partons is used for @xmath8 . to exclude recombination of particles with highly different momenta high - momentum cutoffs of @xmath16 for recombination processes @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 for the aforementioned fusion process @xmath20 are used , where @xmath21 corresponds to typical constituent masses .",
    "we want to stress that recombination and fusion happen on the partonic level , i.e. , the notation denotes the contained partons , which participate in those processes , in the following way : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the recombination ( or fusion ) processes can take place if the quantum numbers allow the partons of at least two of the three overlapping hadrons to recombine into new hadronic correlations , whereas this process is mediated by the partons of the third hadron .",
    "effectively , this is a three - body interaction or at most a kind of in - medium two - body interaction but no additional two - body interaction in the vacuum .",
    "hence the total vacuum hadron - hadron cross section implemented in the qgsm is not changed . anyway , as mentioned above no explicit in - medium cross sections have been introduced because all recombination processes are dynamically treated on the partonic level .",
    "nevertheless it is possible to estimate effective cross sections for the implemented partonic recombinations between the hadronic correlations .",
    "the maximum value of the inclusive cross section for recombination processes like @xmath25 or @xmath20 is basically determined by the aformentioned spatial coalescence radius @xmath8 .",
    "the allowed maximum value of @xmath26 @xcite is geometrically related to a cross section not larger than about @xmath27 . because the dense medium produced in the overlap zone of a highly energetic au+au collision is dominated by `` pionic correlations ''",
    ", the recombination of partons coming from and going to two `` pions '' in presence of the partons of a third ( medium ) `` pion '' happens most frequently .",
    "nearly 90% of all recombination processes with three pionic states in the initial channel are reactions of this kind , whereas the `` fusion process '' @xmath28 is distinctly suppressed .",
    "accordingly , the effective cross section of the latter process is several orders of magnitude smaller than the estimated cross section of the first process , which turns out to be not larger than @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , we have estimated effective cross sections for the partons ( quarks and antiquarks ) involved in recombinations by their distance in momentum space using @xmath30 .",
    "depending on the center - of - mass energy of the ( anti)quarks , the partonic cross section is in the order of a few millibarn but definitely not larger than the aforementioned @xmath27 .",
    "the rate of recombination processes is determined by the cutoff parameter for high momenta @xmath31 : increasing @xmath31 increases the recombination rate .",
    "however , the additional recombination processes with highly different momenta have only very small cross sections . because the bulk of recombination processes happens to take place with @xmath32 close to the cutoff @xmath31",
    ", an averaged cross section would yield a value comparable to parton scattering cross sections used , e.g. , in the ampt model @xcite .",
    "the implemented procedure always ensures that only physical particles can be final hadronic states , e.g. , no final diquark states are possible . also the reaction @xmath33 , i.e. , the partons of a hadron and a baryon - antibaryon pair form finally a hadron and three mesons , which contains as a subprocess the backreaction to `` meson fusion '' , is not included in the recombination scheme because annihilation of baryons and antibaryons is already implemented in the qgsm as a standard two - particle reaction @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , the model allows for the formation of resonance states and their decay .",
    "consequently , subprocesses such as @xmath35 , which can also increase the particle number , are incorporated in the model .",
    "however , if the outcome of a recombination process would yield any unphysical particle it can not take place . either an other valid recombination process is then chosen or , if none is possible , no recombination occurs .",
    "apart from recombining to new mesons , ( anti)baryons or baryon - antibaryon pairs , quark - antiquark annihilation is possible when the partons of three mesons participate in a recombination process .",
    "thus a quark - antiquark pair of the same flavour , but belonging to different mesons , may annihilate with a redistribution of its energy and momentum to the new mesons formed by the remaining partons .",
    "the probability of this annihilation process @xmath36 with respect to @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath37 , has been adjusted to reproduce the experimental @xmath38 charged hadron multiplicities . by means of this annihilation process @xmath36 an effective backward reaction for diffractive scattering is included . from the possible recombination and annihilation processes , including the case that nothing happens at all , i.e. , all partons recombine to the original hadrons , the actual reaction is randomly chosen .",
    "these processes are checked for all combinations of overlapping hadrons , making thereby sure , however , that the particular partons of the selected hadron triplet can only once per time step  which is about @xmath39  participate in such processes .",
    "if no recombination ( annihilation ) or fusion processes take place normal elastic or inelastic scattering occurs .",
    "charge conservation is automatically guaranteed within our approach , but conserving energy and three - momentum simultaneously is not possible for the recombination processes described above . generally , there are problems to conserve simultaneously energy and momentum within partonic coalescence / recombination approaches , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , where conservation of momentum has been chosen whereas conservation of energy has been violated . in our model , conservation of energy is violated in most recombination processes on the level of few percentages only . however , applying a rescaling procedure for the momenta in the center - of - mass system of the produced hadronic correlations , we are able to ensure simultaneous conservation of energy and three - momentum with a precision better than 1 mev . to conserve the initial energy the three - momentum components of all particles involved in a particular reaction",
    "are scaled by a constant factor which is determined iteratively . moreover , by such a procedure ratios of momenta , e.g. , anisotropic flow coefficients , are remain unchanged . in other words ,",
    "the anisotropic flow is not artificially influenced by the momentum rescaling .",
    "all particles are allowed to interact via the recombination procedure described above , even non - formed ( pre- ) hadrons . in this spirit",
    "the model does not create a `` system of free partons '' but effectively emulates a medium of very strongly correlated partons , i.e. , quark - antiquark and ( anti)quark-(anti)diquark states . to not shorten or modify the formation times of the nonformed `` hadrons '' , their formation time is now interpreted on the quark level , meaning the time for the constituent partons to be fully created . as a consequence of that",
    "each hadron gets a formation time for each constituent [ quark , antiquark or ( anti- ) diquark ] @xmath40 and @xmath41 . within a normal production process such as string - breaking @xmath40 and",
    "@xmath41 are equal . for the recombination mechanism",
    "the newly produced hadronic states get the formation times of their constituents .",
    "the new hadron will be fully formed if the lifetime exceeds the larger formation time and partially formed ( like a leading hadron ) if the lifetime exceeds the smaller formation time .",
    "these partially formed hadrons are allowed to rescatter assuming additive constituent cross sections .",
    "first we examine the influence of parton recombination on the kinetic equilibration in the central cell of the overlap zone of au+au collisions .",
    "this cell is given by @xmath42 for a central au+au reaction with impact parameter @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 for a semiperipheral reaction ( @xmath46 ) , respectively .",
    "the corresponding equilibration ratio @xmath47 is determined by the pressure components in x , y and z directions , @xmath48 ( see discussion in ref .",
    "the qgsm results with and without implementation of parton recombination are depicted in fig .",
    "[ eq1 ] .     in the central cell of the overlap zone for central and semiperipheral au+au reactions at @xmath2 for qgsm simulations with ( filled symbols ) and without ( open symbols ) partonic recombination processes .",
    "[ eq1 ] ]    a difference in the degree of local kinetic equilibration is clearly seen when one compares the standard qgsm results with the parton recombination scenario .",
    "the latter mechanism leads very effectively to a much faster and smoother equilibration for both , the central and semiperipheral collisions . essentially , the decomposition and recombination procedure reshuffles rapidly the momenta of partons and finally of the hadrons which drive the system undoubtedly into kinetic equilibrium within short times . for central reactions ,",
    "the matter in the central cell is practically fully equilibrated , i.e. , @xmath49 , after very few @xmath50 time of evolution . here",
    ", of course , the effect of the recombination mechanism is strongest , because it is clearly a density - dependent mechanism . but even for semiperipheral collisions the local pre - equilibrium stage identified by @xmath51",
    "is remarkably shortened compared to the scenario without recombination of partons in the dense stages of the expanding medium .",
    "it should be noticed that the offset of @xmath52 seen in fig .",
    "[ eq1 ] is due to the chosen cell size and is of technical nature . in the first few time",
    "steps the pressure is dominated by the longitudinal flow of the nuclei penetrating the cell . disregarding this offset",
    "one can see that parton recombination reduces the equilibration time of the system approximately by a factor of 5 from @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "the interplay between fast thermal equilibration and the amount of anisotropic flow , in particular the elliptic flow , measured in high - energy heavy - ion reactions is strongly debated ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite the idea has been supported that a fast and complete thermal equilibration is not strictly necessary to produce _ large _ elliptic flow . nevertheless , a conspicuous difference in shape in particular between the pseudorapidity distributions of the elliptic flow at midrapidity determined in the experiment and in the simulation was observed .",
    "hence it is very natural to study the effect of the quark recombination mechanism on the azimuthal anisotropy parameter @xmath1 within the qgsm @xcite .     of charged hadrons from the standard qgsm ( open symbols ) @xcite and those obtained with parton recombination ( filled symbols )",
    "are compared to phobos data of minimum bias au+au collisions at @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the statistical error bars are shown together with the systematic errors of the experimental data ( gray boxes ) .",
    "[ fig : v2etahchar1 ] ]    figure [ fig : v2etahchar1 ] shows the pseudorapidity dependence of the elliptic flow @xmath1 of charged hadrons for minimum bias au+au collisions at @xmath2 . the qgsm results including parton recombination and the standard approach without recombination @xcite are compared with the experimental data of the phobos collaboration @xcite .",
    "the elliptic flow obtained within the standard qgsm displays a strong in - plane alignment in accordance with the experimental findings . at midrapdity",
    "@xmath55 the flow parameter @xmath1 is almost constant , but then it rises up slightly followed by a rapid drop at @xmath56 .",
    "the emergence of this peculiar double bump structure in @xmath3 was strongly connected with the model dynamics ( for more details , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in contrast ,",
    "the experimentally observed elliptic flow shows a pronounced peak at midrapidity and a steady decrease for @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is remarkably well reproduced when partonic recombination processes are taken into account .",
    "the parton rearrangement processes in the dense medium lead to a redistribution of the elliptic flow of the final hadrons toward midrapidity , i.e. , @xmath1 is accumulated at @xmath58 , whereas it is distinctly reduced in the region around @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the double bump structure in @xmath3 obtained in the standard version of the qgsm disappears .",
    "this striking feature holds also for the centrality dependence of @xmath3 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : v2etahchar2 ] . here ,",
    "the results from the qgsm simulations and the phobos analysis ( combined data from the hit- and track - based methods ) for three different centrality classes are overlaid .",
    "the qgsm , including partonic recombination processes , is able to describe the magnitude as well as the pseudorapidity dependence of @xmath3 remarkably well for all the centrality classes , ranging from central via midcentral to peripheral in accordance with the definitions in ref .",
    "@xcite .     for charged hadrons from @xmath2 au+au reactions for three centrality classes according to the phobos analysis @xcite .",
    "the identification marking is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : v2etahchar1 ] .",
    "[ fig : v2etahchar2 ] ]    this is a highly non - trivial result , since a simultaneous description of both observables has neither been achieved by other standard string - cascade transport models such as relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( rqmd ) or ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) @xcite , nor by purely hydrodynamical calculations @xcite .",
    "so far , only a hydrodynamics+cascade hybrid approach with glauber model initial conditions was able to give a fair description of the experimental data , with the exception of the midrapidity region in the most central collision class @xcite .",
    "there it has been argued that the hadronic cascade provides the right amount of dissipation to bring the ideal fluid prediction down to the measured values , especially in peripheral collisions and away from midrapidity .    following this argument ,",
    "the @xmath1 results obtained with the extended qgsm may be interpreted in a complementary way as follows : in contrast to a highly dissipative hadronic medium , the parton recombination processes lead to a reduction of the mean free path in the very dense stages of a heavy - ion collision at midrapidity . accordingly , the viscosity of this strongly interacting partonic medium is effectively lowered in comparison to the pure hadronic medium , i.e. , the rearrangement processes on the partonic level reduce the amount of dissipation in the highly dense matter and enhance the elliptic flow , especially in the midrapidity region , to bring the theoretical predictions in line with the data . thus far",
    "the qgsm upgraded by the locally density - dependent parton recombination mechanism quasi models the possible dynamics of a sqgp from a microscopical point of view .",
    "a complementary observable regarding anisotropic flow phenomena is the directed flow @xmath0 of produced particles . in fig .",
    "[ fig : v1etahchar ] , the results for the pseudorapidity dependence of this flow component , i.e. , @xmath60 of charged final hadrons , obtained by qgsm simulations with and without parton recombination processes are compared to the corresponding experimental data from the phobos collaboration for 0% to 40% central au+au collisions at the highest rhic energy of @xmath2 .     for charged hadrons .",
    "the results obtained with the standard qgsm ( open symbols ) @xcite and those from a simulation using the qgsm extended by parton recombination ( filled symbols ) are shown in comparison to phobos data @xcite .",
    "the systematic errors of the experimental data are indicated by gray boxes and the statistical errors are indicated by bars .",
    "[ fig : v1etahchar ] ]    the result of the standard qgsm shows a characteriatic _ wiggle _ structure extensively discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas the scenario with parton recombination is able to reproduce the experimentally observed directed flow very well in the broad midrapidity region where @xmath0 is essentially flat and close to zero . from the microscopical point of view , this is another hint for a strongly interacting partonic medium which exists during the early dense stage of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions around midrapidity .",
    "thus , our findings are in line with the results of an anisotropic flow study using a multiphase transport ( ampt ) model that includes both initial partonic and final hadronic interactions @xcite .",
    "there also the conclusion has been drawn that the matter produced during the early stage of au+au collisions at @xmath2 in the pseudorapidity region @xmath61 is dominated by partons .",
    "in summary , it has been demonstrated that partonic fusion and recombination processes which occur in the very dense medium created in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion reactions during the early stages lead to short relaxation times and drive the system to fast kinetic equilibrium .",
    "the basis for these investigations was a microscopic transport model , namely the quark - gluon string model ( qgsm ) based on the color exchange mechanism for string formation , which has been extended by a locally density - dependent partonic recombination procedure to model effectively the dynamics of a strongly coupled quark plasma and final hadronic interactions .",
    "moreover , the pseudorapidity distributions of the anisotropy parameter @xmath3 of final charged hadrons has been found to be intimately related to the corresponding dynamics .",
    "fast equilibration due to parton recombination is necessary in order to obtain @xmath3 profiles which are clearly peaked at midrapidity as seen in the data .",
    "we want to note that the other observables studied with the standard qgsm @xcite turned out to be essentially robust against the inclusion of quark recombination .",
    "in particular the particle species dependence of @xmath62 is still reproduced with the extended qgsm .",
    "the rapidity distribution for the final hadrons and their directed flow @xmath60 are even considerably improved .    in conjunction with our aforementioned results for the local equilibration behavior , this is from the microscopical point of view a strong indication for the creation of a strongly interacting partonic medium in au+au collisions at rhic that is thermally equilibrated on a very short time scale .",
