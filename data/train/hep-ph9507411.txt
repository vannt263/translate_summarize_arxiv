    "<S> the measured mass was @xmath3 gev from cdf and @xmath4 gev from d0 . </S>",
    "<S> the standard model ( sm ) @xcite that was proposed more than 20 years ago is confirmed to a solid ground as all the ingredients were found , except for electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . </S>",
    "<S> the understanding of ewsb is necessary to explain all fermion and gauge boson masses on a fundamental level . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of the next generation of colliders is the exploration of the ewsb sector . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the ewsb sector can be probed by studying longitudinal vector boson scattering @xcite , and also through the indirect implication from precision measurements @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> since the top quark is very heavy it provides another avenue to study ewsb because the coupling of the top to the goldstone bosons and the higgs boson is of order @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the studies of the interactions among the top quark , goldstone bosons , and the ewsb sector enable one to reach the nonperturbative regime of the sector . thus </S>",
    "<S> , their interactions can give light to the structure of the ewsb sector . </S>",
    "<S> as a remark here , the production of @xmath6 has been proposed as a probe to extended color sectors beyond sm , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , su@xmath7 su@xmath8 su@xmath9 @xcite , to some technicolor resonances @xcite , or to the top - color models @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since we are interested only in ewsb , we assume that there is no complicated color sectors other than the usual su@xmath9 , and the light fermions and gluons do not couple directly to the new physics of ewsb . under our assumptions </S>",
    "<S> the top production via @xmath10 will not deviate from the sm , except for the @xmath11 rescattering via the new interactions of the ewsb sector . </S>",
    "<S> this is certainly an interesting area to study . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the higgs boson can contribute to the @xmath11 production via @xmath12 , which interferes nontrivially with @xmath13 to give interesting structures near the resonance peak in the @xmath14 spectrum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but due to enormous qcd @xmath13 production and the other decay channels of the higgs boson , it is difficult to detect the nontrivial structures around the resonance peak @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we propose the study of four top , @xmath1 , production as a probe to ewsb . </S>",
    "<S> this reaction is more advantageous than just the @xmath11 production when the new physics does not couple to light quarks or gluons . </S>",
    "<S> another reason is that since the four - top production is actually small at the lhc energies such that any appreciable enhancement from the sm predictions is easy to detect . </S>",
    "<S> the schematic diagram for the signal of @xmath1 production via ewsb interactions is shown in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  [ fig1 ] , in which the tops and antitops come from the splitting of gluons . </S>",
    "<S> two of the tops are strongly scattered via the new interactions of the ewsb sector , and the other two simply go off without interacting . </S>",
    "<S> we refer the latter as spectator tops . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we shall study this signal using the effective lagrangian method , and by specifying some particular resonances . </S>",
    "<S> we shall show that in the effective lagrangian approach the enhancement of cross sections , due to the 4-fermion operators , is substantial . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , sm higgs boson can only give a marginal enhancement over the background . </S>",
    "<S> but for the tev vector resonances , the cross sections could be very large because of absence of bounds on the coupling . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that this reaction is feasible as a probe to ewsb , even under the presence of qcd backgrounds .    </S>",
    "<S> we first use the effective lagrangian approach to parameterize the scattering part of the reaction , @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> assuming all heavy particles in the underlying theory have been integrated out , @xmath15 interactions can be parameterized by a set of dimension - six 4-fermion operators @xmath16 as @xmath17 where @xmath18 s are the coefficients of the operators , and @xmath19 is the cut - off scale , below which the effective theory is valid . </S>",
    "<S> the operators are @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the su@xmath9 color matrices . </S>",
    "<S> operators of higher dimensions are suppressed by extra powers of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> each operator should correspond to the dynamics of the underlying theory , e.g. , the operator @xmath22 arises from an exchange of technirho @xmath23 of technicolor theories . </S>",
    "<S> a few remarks regarding @xmath18 s and @xmath19 are in order . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) the size of the coefficients @xmath18 s , by naive dimension analysis , is of order but less than @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient , say , @xmath25 can be estimated from the heavy higgs model , @xmath26 tev , by integrating out the heavy higgs boson in the @xmath27 scattering . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath28 , the effective four fermion coupling is @xmath29 for @xmath30 gev . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath25 is of order 1 if @xmath31 tev in the heavy higgs model . </S>",
    "<S> we also expect other @xmath18 s to be of order 1 . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) we expect the new physics of ewsb to come in in the order of tev , we therefore choose @xmath31  tev . </S>",
    "<S> results for other choices of @xmath19 can be easily implied . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) we do not consider the interference between the @xmath32 of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ int ] ) and the sm . </S>",
    "<S> the leading sm @xmath15 scattering is via a single gluon exchange , so that it does not have interference with the operators @xmath33 , which are color - singlet . </S>",
    "<S> the primed operators @xmath34 actually interfere with the single gluon - exchange @xmath27 diagrams , but they give much smaller results than the unprimed ones ( see results below ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the scattering amplitude , due to the new interactions , scales as @xmath35 , and the resulting cross sections as @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we only look at one operator at a time . later </S>",
    "<S> , we shall give the signal cross sections in the form of @xmath37 , where @xmath38 s are calculated by @xmath11 scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we consider the specific dynamics of the underlying theory . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest model is the sm with one higgs doublet . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of the sm higgs boson to the top quark is given by @xmath39 . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , we can also consider a model with nonstandard yukawa coupling @xmath40 where @xmath41 are real constants . </S>",

    "<S> the sm results can be recovered by putting @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    as mentioned above the operator @xmath22 </S>",
    "<S> can be induced by a technirho . </S>",

    "<S> , the @xmath51 and @xmath53 will also decay primarily into the goldstone bosons , which are the longitudinal component of the @xmath56 and @xmath57 bosons . </S>",

    "<S> we assume that the decay width of @xmath68 into gauge bosons are much larger than that into fermions . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we chose the total width @xmath74 to be @xmath77 . for @xmath78 and @xmath79 tev , the width @xmath80 gev and the total width @xmath81 gev . </S>",
    "<S> this model is , therefore , specified by any two of these three parameters : @xmath75 , @xmath74 , and @xmath76 .    </S>",
    "<S> the subprocess cross section is folded with the effective luminosity for the top quark inside the proton . </S>",
    "<S> the top as a parton inside the proton can be regarded as originating from gluon splitting @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the gluon parton distribution function and @xmath84 is the altarelli - parisi splitting kernel . </S>",

    "<S> next , the sm higgs boson gives only a small cross section of 0.71.2fb for @xmath86 gev . </S>",
    "<S> for the general higgs model of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tth ] ) we chose the coupling constant @xmath87 to be the same as the sm value , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 . it gives only about 10% larger cross sections than the sm higgs boson . on the other hand , the vector resonance model gives potentially much larger cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> we chose @xmath79 tev and the total width @xmath74 to be 0.3 ( 0.5 ) tev . according to our assumption , @xmath90 , and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ttwidth ] ) , we have @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting cross section is 5.8 ( 9.4 ) fb .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , we have not considered backgrounds . </S>",
    "<S> the major background is the qcd production of four top , @xmath92 , at the order of @xmath93 via the processes @xmath94 @xcite . among these two processes , @xmath95 is the dominant one at the lhc energies and it is closer to the event topology of the signal than the other one . </S>",
    "<S> we verified that the cross section for @xmath96 is only 10  15% of that for @xmath95 with or without the cuts that we apply below . in the above calculations , </S>",
    "<S> the kinematics of the spectator tops can not be obtained by the method of effective top - parton luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> we need an exact calculation of the signal to compare with the background . </S>",
    "<S> because the kinematics of the spectator tops is independent of the interaction models of the scattered tops , we can look at one particular model that can be calculated exactly , and the kinematics thus obtained is also valid for other models . </S>",
    "<S> the sm higgs model can be calculated exactly as @xmath97 followed by @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the following we shall distinguish the signal , @xmath99 , from the qcd background , @xmath100 , by comparing the distributions of a few observables .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with the cuts for observing the tops @xmath101 there is a technical problem in identifying which are the spectator tops and scattered tops . </S>",
    "<S> one solution is to order the tops according to their transverse momenta as @xmath102 in which we identify the tops with smaller @xmath103 ( @xmath104 and @xmath105 ) as the spectator tops , and the tops with larger @xmath103 ( @xmath106 and @xmath107 ) as the scattered tops . </S>",
    "<S> we verified that this method of identifying the spectator and scattered tops is very close to the theoretical case when distributions are concerned . </S>",
    "<S> once we identify the tops , we can impose a large invariant mass cut on the scattered pair , since they are scattered via the new strong interaction of ewsb , while the tops from the background interact only via the qcd interaction , which becomes weak at the tev scale . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we impose @xmath108 since it will not hurt the signal for , e.g. , a 1 tev resonance with a width of a few hundred gev . among many observables , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are useful . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath109 is the vector difference between the transverse momenta of the scattered tops : @xmath111 this observable is used to exploit the back - to - back nature of the scattered tops in the transverse plane after the strong scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the normalized differential cross sections versus @xmath112 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) a further cut of , say , @xmath113 gev can improve the signal . </S>",
    "<S> the observable @xmath114 is the difference in rapidities of the spectator tops , given by @xmath115 we show the normalized differential cross section versus @xmath114 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a dip in the region @xmath116 for the signal but not for the background . </S>",
    "<S> this is easily explained by the color - flow between the spectator tops , analogous to the rapidity gap physics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when the central tops are scattered by a colorless bosons ( in this case the sm higgs ) , there is no net color - flow between the two spectator tops . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we expect a rapidity gap to exist between the two spectator tops in the signal , while it is not true for the background . </S>",
    "<S> it is particularly interesting for the colorless models , since from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cresult ] ) we notice that the cross sections are much larger when the tops are scattered by colorless bosons than by colored bosons .    </S>",
    "<S> we give the effectiveness of the various cuts in table  [ table ] . </S>",
    "<S> if the signal and background start with the same cross section before the cuts , the signal will end up 5 times as large as the background after all the cuts , as shown in table  [ table ] . </S>",
    "<S> the starting cross section for the background process @xmath95 ranges from 3 to 7 fb for the factorization scale being varied from @xmath117 to @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the background , after all the cuts , ranges between 0.3 to 0.7 fb . on the other hand , before the cuts the smallest signal is 0.71.2 fb coming from the sm higgs boson and the largest is 5.8(9.4 ) fb from the vector resonance of mass 1 tev and width 0.3(0.5 ) tev . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , after applying the cuts in table  [ table ] , there is a large excess of the signal for the vector resonance ( 2.84.6 fb ) and for the effective lagrangian method over the background ( 0.30.7 fb ) , but only a marginal excess for the sm higgs signal ( 0.30.6 fb ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we also emphasize the importance of the invariant mass @xmath14 distribution , which is useful in identifying any resonance structures or enhancement in the tev region . </S>",
    "<S> so far , we only presented results for @xmath30 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the feasibility of using @xmath92 production to probe the ewsb improves for heavier tops , since ( i ) the qcd background decreases with increase in @xmath119 , and ( ii ) the coupling of the top to the ewsb sector increases with @xmath119 . in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated the feasibility of using @xmath92 production as a probe to ewsb . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have shown that @xmath14 , @xmath109 , and @xmath114 serve as useful observables to identify the signal , especially for the colorless models . </S>",
    "<S> further investigation is needed to distinguish the different underlying dynamics of the ewsb sector . </S>",
