    "the anisotropic expansion of a condensate after release from a trap is one of the best known features of the bose - einstein condensed state @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy arises because the condensate expands most rapidly in directions where it was originally most confined .",
    "the interest in this phenomenon is further growing , in particular since the observation of anisotropic expansions in non - condensed bose gases @xcite and in degenerate fermi gases @xcite .",
    "anisotropic expansions are indicative for hydrodynamic behavior .",
    "it is well known that thomas - fermi condensates can be described by the classical euler equation for potential flow of a non - viscous gas @xcite .",
    "therefore , they behave hydrodynamically even at very low densities . for classical clouds",
    "the situation is density dependent . at low densities , where the mean free path is large compared to the size of the cloud ( collisionless regime ) , the expansion proceeds under free flow conditions ( free expansion ) .",
    "the motion of the individual atoms is described by a single - particle hamiltonian and the expansion is isotropic . reducing the mean free path to a value smaller than the dimension of the cloud allows the introduction of a hydrodynamic field and leads to a crossover to hydrodynamic behavior ( hydrodynamic expansion ) .",
    "little difference is to be expected between the expansion of a condensate and that of a fully hydrodynamic thermal cloud @xcite .",
    "both the collisionless and the hydrodynamic regime were studied theoretically ( see @xcite and references therein ) . also the influence of mean - field effects @xcite and the crossover between the two regimes were analyzed theoretically @xcite and numerically @xcite .",
    "it is important to understand the crossover to hydrodynamic behavior in thermal clouds . from the fundamental point of view",
    "it is important to quantify the hydrodynamic properties as these affect the coupling between condensates and thermal clouds . from the experimental point of view",
    "it is vital for the correct interpretation of time - of - flight absorption images of dense atomic clouds .",
    "previously the crossover regime in thermal clouds was probed in experiments at mit with a dense gas of @xmath1na atoms @xcite and at ens using cold metastable triplet @xmath2he @xcite . in amsterdam",

    "we focus on hydrodynamic behavior as observed in the expansion of dense thermal clouds of @xmath0rb , extending a brief analysis presented earlier in the context of the bec formation experiments in amsterdam @xcite .",
    "the clouds are prepared in an elongated trap at a temperature @xmath3 just above the critical temperature for bose - einstein condensation . at the highest densities",
    "the mean free path is less than the radial size of the cloud .",
    "after release from the trap the clouds expand anisotropically and their temperature drops by as much as @xmath4 .",
    "the behavior is intermediate between that expected for collisionless clouds , where cooling is absent , and pure hydrodynamic behavior , where the gas cools to vanishing temperatures .",
    "we show that the expansion in axial direction is similar to that of a collisionless cloud at a temperature @xmath5 .",
    "this ` axial ' temperature can be identified with the temperature @xmath6 reached at the moment when the expansion ceases to be hydrodynamic and the cooling stops .",
    "radially , the expansion proceeds faster than that expected for a collisionless cloud and can be characterized by a ` radial ' temperature @xmath7 . for our conditions ,",
    "the mean field of elastic interaction contributes @xmath8 to the total energy in the trap center .",

    "@xmath18k following directly from the radial expansion .",
    "we found the fitting procedure for determining @xmath3 @xmath70 and @xmath6 to be very sensitive for the detailed shape of the fit function . choosing a simple gaussian reduces the estimated values for these temperatures by as much as @xmath146 .",
    "however , this enormous systematic error does not affect the corresponding aspect ratios by more than a few parts in a thousand .",
    "we found more indicators that the aspect ratios are more accurately determined than the absolute values .",
    "interestingly , we find for the aspect ratios standard deviations of typically @xmath147 , i.e. twice as small as for the absolute size @xcite .",
    "this points to some form of error cancellation .",
    "also the fit to the aspect ratio is somewhat better than those of the separate plots .",
    "let us now turn to the results for the aspect ratios as presented in fig.[fig : aspectratio ] . using eqs.([eq8 ] ) , ( [ eq8a ] ) and ( [ energy conservation ] ) the evolution of the aspect ratio can be expressed as @xmath148^{1/2}\\omega_{z}t}{[1+\\xi+(t_{\\ast}/t_{0})\\omega_{z}^{2}(t - t_{\\ast } ) ^{2}]^{1/2 } } , \\label{eq13}%\\ ] ] where we presume @xmath149 as in eq.([eq8a ] ) .",

    "once eq.([eq13 ] ) is accepted , time - of - flight information for a single expansion time suffices for thermometry .",
    "the procedure goes in two steps .",
    "first we set @xmath153 and @xmath66 equal to zero and use eq.([eq13 ] ) to obtain a first estimate for @xmath157 with eq.([nicely ] ) @xmath158 follows .",
    "after @xmath70 is determined with eq.([eq8a ] ) , we have an estimate for the absolute value @xmath29 . together with @xmath159 deduced with eq.([centraldensity ] ) , this allows us to calculate @xmath153 and @xmath66 .",
    "iterating the procedure once yields all values within the limits of accuracy of the analysis . choosing the expansion time sufficiently long @xmath160 the results are very insensitive for the value of @xmath66 .",
    "our estimates for the absolute values of @xmath3 @xmath70 and @xmath69 are sensitive for the detailed shape of the clouds .",
    "therefore , deviations from the bose shape will result in systematic errors , in particular if the cloud shape changes during the expansion .",
    "shape deviations can arise from the presence of the mean field .",
    "also , inhomogeneous isentropic cooling as a result of the inhomogeneous density profile of our samples can give rise to deviations of the bose shape .",
    "further , it may be that our transformation from optical density to column density gives rise to slight distortions of the cloud shape as a result of optical pumping or saturation of the detection transition .    in our analysis",
    "we did not correct for deviations of the cloud shape from the bose distribution .",
    "first of all because under our conditions the mean field is weak and our fits of eq.([columndensity ] ) to the measured column densities look convincingly . secondly , because shape deviations produce similar relative errors in all three temperatures .",
    "therefore , they do not affect the conclusions and consistency of our analysis as long as the scaling approach remains valid .",
    "we studied the behavior of dense elongated clouds of @xmath0rb in the crossover from the collisionless to the hydrodynamic regime . at our highest densities",
    "the mean free path is slightly smaller than the radial size of the cloud and the expansion is anisotropic .",
    "the expansion can be described by a two stage model in which the expansion is treated as purely hydrodynamic up to time @xmath65 and as purely collisionless beyond this point .",
    "we find that at the end of the hydrodynamic stage the temperature has dropped substantially due to isentropic cooling , @xmath152 .",
    "this reflects itself in an axial expansion that is substantially slower than expected for the collisionless case , @xmath161 . in accordance with energy conservation",
    "the radial expansion is faster , @xmath7 .",
    "the isentropic cooling is best determined from the aspect ratio .",

    "the mean - field corrections are too small to be extracted with a fitting procedure but can be calculated accurately .",

    "presently it is possible to study the case of strong mean fields by tuning to a feschbach resonance @xcite .",
