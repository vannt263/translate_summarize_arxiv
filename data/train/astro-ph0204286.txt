    "compact groups are small systems of galaxies with each member apparently in close proximity to the other members .",
    "they are presumed to be physically associated and often show morphological peculiarities indicative of gravitational interaction .",
    "hickson ( 1982 ) , by examining palomar observatory sky survey plates , identified 100 compact groups of galaxies with membership defined by the following criteria : ( i ) there are more than 4 galaxies in the group within 3 magnitudes of the brightest member .",
    "( ii ) the group must be isolated so that no external galaxies fall within a radius of 3 times the angular extent of the group .",
    "( iii ) the total magnitude per arcsec@xmath2 of the group is less than 26 .",
    "considering their high densities and low velocity distributions , compact groups provide an opportunity to study galaxy interactions and their effects , especially considering their short dynamical lifetimes of @xmath3 10@xmath4 yr @xcite .",
    "one facet of such interactions is the presence of intense star formation , and in particular the presence of wolf - rayet features within the spectra of these objects .",
    "wolf - rayet galaxies are a subset of emission line and hii galaxies whose integrated spectra have a broad emission feature around 4650  which has been attributed to wolf - rayet stars .",
    "the emission feature usually consists of a blend of lines , namely hei @xmath54686 , ciii / civ @xmath54650 and niii @xmath54640",
    ". the civ @xmath55808 line can also be an important signature of wolf - rayet activity .",
    "wolf - rayet galaxies are important in understanding massive star formation and starburst evolution @xcite .",
    "the wolf - rayet phase in massive stars is short lived and hence gives the possibility of studying an approximately coeval sample of starburst galaxies .",
    "the first catalog of wolf - rayet galaxies was compiled by conti ( 1991 ) and contains 37 galaxies .",
    "a large number of additional wolf - rayet galaxies have been identified and a recent catalog containing 139 galaxies has been compiled by schaerer et  al .",
    "wolf - rayet galaxies are found among a wide variety of morphological types , from blue compact dwarfs @xcite and irregular galaxies , to massive spirals and luminous merging iras galaxies @xcite , with a range of metallicities and ages @xcite .",
    "hickson compact group ( hcg ) 31 consists of 8 galaxies and was observed using the infrared space observatory ( fig .",
    "1 ) . hickson ( 1982 ) identified galaxies a to d from the palomar sky survey in order of luminosity , with a being the most luminous because it included the central starburst .",
    "however follow - up surveys @xcite included the starburst in galaxy c rather than a thus making c the most luminous member , and we follow this convention . galaxies a and c are also designated together as ngc 1741 , one of the most luminous wolf - rayet galaxies in the catalog of conti ( 1991 ) .",
    "rubin et al . (",
    "1990 ) identified several further members of the hcg 31 group , galaxies e , f , g and a possible member further north , q. the galaxies c and g were included in the markarian survey and were designated as mrk 1089 and mrk 1090 respectively .",
    "hcg 31 is situated at a distance of 54.8 mpc , assuming a hubble parameter of 75 km sec@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 .",
    "the redshift of galaxy d @xcite places it at a distance of 359 mpc , indicating it is not a bona fide member of the hcg 31 group .",
    "we present isocam and isophot results on hcg 31 as part of an observing programme addressing several galaxies exhibiting wolf - rayet signatures .",
    "the observations and data reduction are presented in sect .",
    "the results are contained in sect . 3 and discussed in sect .",
    "the conclusions are summarised in sect .",
    "the iso @xcite observations were obtained using the mid - infrared camera isocam @xcite and the spectrometric mode of the iso photopolarimeter isophot @xcite . the astronomical observing template ( aot ) used was cam01 @xcite , for the imaging observations and pht40 , for spectrometry .",
    "the observing log of the cam01 observations at 7.7 @xmath0 m and 14.3 @xmath0 m using the lw6 and lw3 filters and the pht40 observations is presented in table 1 .",
    "each isocam observation had the following configuration : 3@xmath7 per pixel field of view ( pfov ) , integration time of 5.04 s per readout , a raster with @xmath8 spacecraft pointings with a different stepsize on each axis : 24@xmath7 stepsize between raster points and a 6@xmath7 stepsize between raster lines .",
    "the isocam detector was used in association with one of a selection of four imaging lenses .",
    "these allowed plate - scales of 1.5@xmath7 , 3@xmath7 , 6@xmath7 and 12@xmath7 per pixel to be chosen , resulting in turn in overall detector fields - of - view of 48@xmath7 , 96@xmath7 , and 192@xmath7 square .",
    "the 12@xmath7 per pixel field - of - view ( 12@xmath7 pfov ) did not access much more sky area than the 6@xmath7 pfov due to vignetting of the instrument beam outside a nominal maximum unvignetted field having 3@xmath9 diameter .",
    "the observations discussed here employed the 3@xmath7 per pixel field - of - view , giving an overall detector field of view of 96@xmath7 square .",
    "apart from these details of the detector plate - scale and fov , the spatial resolution was determined by the point spread function ( psf ) , which had a full - width in arcseconds at the first airy minimum of 0.84x@xmath5 , with @xmath5 expressed in @xmath0 m .",
    "so for the 14.3 @xmath0 m filter , the full width of the first airy minimum was 12@xmath7 resulting in a rayleigh criterion of 6@xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding number for the 7.7 @xmath0 m filter was 3.2@xmath7 .",
    "all cam data processing was performed with the cam interactive analysis ( cia ) system @xcite , and the following method was applied during data processing : ( i ) dark subtraction was performed using a dark model with correction for slow drift of the dark current throughout the mission .",
    "( ii ) glitch effects due to cosmic rays were removed following the method of aussel et al .",
    "( iii ) transient correction for flux attenuation due to the lag in the detector response was performed by the method described by abergel et al .",
    "( iv ) the raster map was flat - fielded using a library flat - field .",
    "( v ) pixels affected by glitch residuals and other persistent effects were manually suppressed . ( vi )",
    "the raster mosaic images were deconvolved with a multi - resolution transform method @xcite .",
    "deconvolution or image restoration is a difficult step in image processing especially in dealing with images with many instrumental and noise defects such as those found in cam data .",
    "consider a signal @xmath10 , the result of the observation of an object @xmath11 through an optical system .",
    "this system may be characterised by the point spread function ( psf ) @xmath12 .",
    "the observed signal results from the degradation , or convolution , of @xmath12 with @xmath11 and the inclusion of noise @xmath13 :    @xmath14    to correct for the degradation of the optical system , @xmath11 must be determined knowing @xmath15 and @xmath12 .",
    "the presence of the additive noise means that there is an infinite number of solutions to this equation .",
    "one of the most widely used techniques for determining a solution is the multi - resolution transform method @xcite .",
    "it is based on the idea that a given realization of a random variable carries an amount of information that is inversely proportional to its entropy . among an infinite number of solutions ,",
    "the one that maximises its entropy will minimise the amount of information required to make it compatible with the observed data .",
    "the deconvolved map yielded resolution enhancements of a factor of 1.2 to 1.6 with the higher values associated with the 7.7 micron map .",
    "spatial resolution for the 7.7 micron map was 2.2@xmath7 , and 5@xmath7 for the 14.3 micron map .",
    "similar resolution enhancements by factors of 1.2 to 2.0 were obtained using the multi - resolution transform method on hst and also iso data @xcite .",
    "there was a loss of flux in this process for the weaker , point - like sources ( d , e ) .",
    "on the other hand , more extended sources such as the galaxies a and c have their fluxes conserved through the deconvolution process .",
    "the deconvolved maps are presented here , with the source photometry performed on the non - deconvolved maps .",
    "colour ratios taken on the deconvolved maps are valid because any attenuation of source flux occurs similarly for a given source in each filter .",
    "photometry was performed by integrating the pixels containing source flux exceeding the background by 3@xmath16 .",
    "fluxes measured in broadband filters are essentially valid either for the nominally assumed @xmath5@xmath6 source spectrum , or even if the measured and modelled galaxy spectrum is taken into account , since colour correction terms are negligible in this case , compared with the measurement precision .",
    "the lowest contour level is approximately twice the standard deviation of the background noise obtained using pixels from around the border of the image .",
    "the isocam fluxes presented in table 2 have a photometric accuracy of about 15% .",
    "a comparison of photometry for each source before and after deconvolution is given in table 3 .",
    "iras fluxes for ngc 1741 are also given for comparison in table 4 @xcite .",
    "the difference between the 14.3 @xmath0 m and the iras 12 @xmath0 m fluxes is probably due to the strong 8.5 and 11.3 @xmath0 m pah features in the iras band .",
    "comparison of images from different filters was obtained by matching the resolution of the two deconvolved images before creating ratio maps .",
    "the durations of the observations in table 1 give the length of the actual observation including instrumental , but not spacecraft , overheads .",
    "pht - s consists of a dual grating spectrometer with a resolving power of 90 @xcite .",
    "bands ss and sl cover the range of 2.5 - 4.8 @xmath0 m and 5.8 - 11.6 @xmath0 m respectively .",
    "the pht - s spectrum of the nucleus of ngc 1741 was obtained by operating the @xmath17 aperture of pht - s in rectangular chopping mode using the isophot focal plane chopper . in this mode ,",
    "the satellite pointed to the position between the source and an off - source position , and the chopper moved alternately between these two positions .",
    "the source was always in the positive beam in the spacecraft y - direction . for the pht - s spectrum of the lobe of galaxy a",
    ", pht - s was operated in a similar manner . in figure 1 the nominal pht - s aperture ( 24``x24 '' square )",
    "is shown overlaid on the 7.7 @xmath0 m map , for the case of the off - nucleus measurement .",
    "however , the beam profiles differ in detail per pht - s detector and are in general narrower than the nominal aperture @xcite .",
    "the calibration of the spectrum was performed by using a spectral response function derived from several calibration stars of different brightness observed in chopper mode @xcite .",
    "the relative spectrometric uncertainty of the pht - s spectrum is about 20% when comparing different parts of the spectrum that are more than a few microns apart .",
    "the absolute photometric uncertainty is about 30% for bright calibration sources .",
    "all pht data processing was performed using the isophot interactive analysis ( pia ) system , version 8.1 @xcite .",
    "data reduction consisted primarily of the removal of instrumental effects such as radiation events which result in a jump of a minimum of two consecutive read - out values , i.e. in a step within the integration ramp .",
    "the disturbance is usually very short and the slope of the ramp after the glitch is similar to the slope before it .",
    "once the instrumental effects had been removed , background subtraction was performed and flux densities were obtained .",
    "these fluxes were plotted to obtain the spectra for the central starburst region of ngc 1741 and the nucleus of hcg 31a .",
    "a map of the hcg 31 group consisting of a deconvolved 7.7 @xmath0 m lw6 map overlaid on a red deep sky survey ( dss ) image of the group is presented in fig .",
    "1 . deconvolved 7.7 and 14.3 @xmath0 m maps of the central galaxies overlaid on dss and h@xmath18 images are presented in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "the bulk of the 7.7 @xmath0 m and 14.3 @xmath0 m emission comes from the interacting galaxies a and c , which are together designated as ngc 1741 .",
    "peak emission , which is denoted as n on each map , coincides with the central region of galaxy c. a secondary peak is associated with the nucleus of galaxy a , and forms an extension to the emission from galaxy c. the emission at 14.3 @xmath0 m is primarily confined to ngc 1741 , though galaxy e and a star forming knot within galaxy b are also weakly detected . since emission at 14.3 @xmath0 m is a primary tracer of warm dust consisting of very small dust grains stochastically heated in regions of low excitation and/or heated dust close to luminous stars , this indicates that most of the dust in the system is within the galaxy ngc 1741 . on the 7.7 @xmath0 m map ,",
    "emission is much more widespread , with galaxies b and e well detected along with two sources forming an extension of emission from galaxy a. since the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah feature is indicative of star formation @xcite , this map provides a clear representation of the star formation within the system , a fact outlined by the good agreement between the 7.7 @xmath0 m contours and the underlying h@xmath18 map @xcite .",
    "however , a surprising finding was the non - detection of galaxy f on the 7.7 @xmath0 m map , given its easy detection in h@xmath18 .",
    "two other sources were also detected on the 7.7 @xmath0 m map and are denoted by hgc 31:ir1 and hgc 31:ir2 .",
    "these sources do not have any known optical or h@xmath18 counterparts , and a careful inspection of the data cube before coadding of all map pointings suggests that they are the residue of cosmic ray glitches that were not completely eliminated , and we are not treating them as confirmed sources . as regards the remaining members of the group , g and q were outside the isocam map and thus not observed ( fig .",
    "the background galaxy d was detected at 7.7 @xmath0 m , but not in h@xmath18 .",
    "the tycho catalogue star tyc 04758 - 466 - 1 , with m@xmath1 = 11.3 and spectral type f6 was detected at 7.7@xmath0 m and 14.3 @xmath0 m , with a flux ratio that is consistent with the rayleigh - jeans tail of a blackbody , which serves as a valuable cross - check on the isocam photometric calibration at these faint fluxes .",
    "the isocam fluxes for each source from the non - deconvolved maps are given in table 2 .    a pht - s spectrum of the central starburst region of ngc 1741 is presented in fig .",
    "detections were made of unidentified infrared bands ( uibs ) at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 and 11.3 @xmath0 m that are usually attributed to pahs .",
    "the 8.6 @xmath0 m feature has a peak flux roughly equal to the 7.7 @xmath0 m feature , which is unusual in starburst spectra .",
    "such features may be indicative of newly created pahs @xcite .",
    "the feature at 10.65 @xmath0 m may be a blend of features including [ s iv ] .",
    "a pht - s spectrum of the nucleus of galaxy a is presented in fig .",
    "5 . pahs at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.3 @xmath0 m and a feature at 9.7@xmath0 m , possibly pah , were detected but at a level much weaker than in the starburst region .",
    "for both spectra , line fluxes for each feature were obtained by interpolating the continuum between the ends of the wavelength range .",
    "the line fluxes for the central starburst region are given in table 5 , while the fluxes for the nucleus of galaxy a are given in table 6 .    the spectral energy distribution of ngc 1741 using isocam , pht - sl from the central starburst and iras fluxes is presented in fig . 6 .",
    "the dust model , denoted by the solid curve @xcite was fitted to the data and contains three separate dust populations : the pah bands @xcite , a warm dust component at 110 k and a cooler dust component at 40 k , and each component is indicated in fig .",
    "the interaction between galaxies a and c has been the primary cause of the severely disturbed morphology and high rates of star formation within the group .",
    "the most obvious morphological features created by the interaction are the tidal tails ; the northern tidal tail extending from a and containing two iso sources , and a southern tidal tail containing dwarf galaxies e and f. the stripping of h i from galaxies a and c allowed the dwarf galaxies to condense and form within the southern tidal tail .",
    "galaxies b and g have also been affected by the central interaction of a and c. galaxy b appears quite warped in optical and continuum maps @xcite , with star formation located in three h@xmath18 knots .",
    "the galaxy is also linked to galaxy c by a bridge detectable in h@xmath18 .",
    "g exhibits star formation weighted towards the edge of the galaxy facing the southern tail , indicating that star formation within the galaxy has been triggered by interaction with the tail .",
    "the peculiar system morphology and resultant star formation led to investigations of the star formation history of the group @xcite with three distinct modes of star formation suggested .",
    "the strongest mode of star formation , involving galaxies a and c , was a product of the collision between the two , with star formation being concentrated in two strong bursts coinciding with the nuclei of the galaxies .",
    "the secondary mode , directly linked to this interaction , involves the formation of dwarf galaxies from h i stripped from both galaxies .",
    "galaxies e and f seem to have been formed in this manner .",
    "finally , a third mode shows star formation displaced along the edges of the affected galaxies , concentrated in knots .",
    "this mode , responsible for star formation in galaxies b and g , may be due to a stripping mechanism as the galaxies pass through a denser medium such as h i stripped from galaxies a and c. given an interaction timescale of about 400 myr and an age of the central burst of about 4 to 5 myr @xcite , it is clear that these modes of star formation are very recent , ongoing , events in the dynamical history of hcg 31 .",
    "however , the occurance of previous periods of high star formation may be noted by the presence of stellar super - clusters in the central burst with ages over 10 myr @xcite .",
    "ngc 1741 was previously surveyed in x - ray @xcite , uv @xcite , optical / h@xmath18 @xcite , radio @xcite and co @xcite .",
    "it has been estimated that @xmath3 700 wolf rayet and @xmath3 10@xmath19 o - type stars are located within the central burst @xcite . with some knowledge of the content of the burst , it is instructive to determine the current state of star formation in ngc 1741 using a diagnostic such as the 14.3/6.75 @xmath0 m flux ratio for the system .",
    "the 14.3/6.75 @xmath0 m ratio generally decreases as interactions develop and starbursts age @xcite . to determine the 14.3/6.75 @xmath0 m ratio for ngc 1741",
    ", the 6.75 @xmath0 m ( isocam lw2 filter ) flux was synthesized from the pht - s spectrum in the wavelength range of that isocam filter ( 5 to 8.5 @xmath0 m ) . in order to check the accuracy of the synthesised flux",
    ", 6.75 @xmath0 m and 7.7 @xmath0 m fluxes were synthesised for several sources , including mkn 297 and ngc 7714 @xcite , from their pht - s spectra , and the derived values were found to agree with the directly measured isocam fluxes for the sources within the photometric uncertainties . for ngc 1741",
    ", the 14.3/6.75 @xmath0 m ratio was found to be 1.6@xmath200.4 .",
    "this value is quite low .",
    "a ratio above 3 is indicative of high star formation leading to the heating of dust in the nuclear region by hot , young ionising stars @xcite .",
    "since the 14.3 @xmath0 m flux is dominated primarily by emission from very small dust grains and the 6.75 and 7.7 @xmath0 m fluxes are dominated by pahs , the 14.3/7.7 @xmath0 m ratio provides a diagnostic similar to the 14.3/6.75 @xmath0 m ratio , allowing a determination of the current state of the starburst . to determine the 14.3/7.7 @xmath0 m ratio",
    ", fluxes were obtained in strips on each of the raster maps with each strip bisecting ngc 1741 through the central starburst region .",
    "each strip was equally separated by a position angle ( pa ) of 45@xmath21 , measured from north , where pa = 0@xmath21 .",
    "the strips were divided to obtain the 14.3/7.7 @xmath0 m ratio .",
    "one such ratio - strip is presented in fig .",
    "7 , taken from northwest to southeast through the galaxy .",
    "the slope of the 14.3/7.7 @xmath0 m ratio changes over the length of the strip and attains a peak value of 1.9 at the center of the starburst . to the northeast of the burst the ratio drops to 1.5 , while to the southwest the slope is steeper , reaching a minimum of 1.3 .",
    "the higher value of the ratio in the central starburst region may be due to destruction of pahs by uv ionisation from o and b type stars , with an added component due to heating of very small dust grains . in comparison with other galaxies with very active starbursts where the 14.3/6.75 @xmath0 m ratio can exceed 3 , the peak 14.3/7.7 @xmath0 m ratio value of 1.9 for ngc 1741 is quite low @xcite .",
    "the low ratio values and the age of the burst @xcite suggest that , while the small central region of ngc 1741 is still in the throes of a very recent starburst , the central region may be moving into a post - starburst stage with cessation of the formation of the most massive stars @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to previous higher resolution surveys which suggest strong ongoing star formation , especially in compact regions @xcite .",
    "however , the lower ratio values for ngc 1741 may be due to iso being sensitive to a more extended region with less activity .",
    "the aging of the burst may be due to supernovae and stellar winds @xcite disrupting the interstellar medium , preventing further star formation as soon as the first generation of o stars have formed and evolved @xcite .",
    "several surveys of hcgs have led to a debate about the nature of the activity within compact groups .",
    "sulentic and rabaca ( 1993 ) and venugopal ( 1995 ) contest the claim by hickson et al .",
    "( 1989 ) that far infrared emission is enhanced in compact groups , arguing that while tidal interactions and mergers did occur in the past in compact groups @xcite , most compact group galaxies seem to exhibit the behaviour of normal galaxies . however",
    ", a significant proportion of the brightest hcgs do display some sort of activity , be it starburst or agn @xcite .",
    "co surveys of hcgs @xcite have shown that co deficient groups are also the most dynamically evolved and show a history of strong star formation .",
    "an extreme example is hcg 16 , which includes one seyfert 2 galaxy , two luminous liner galaxies and 3 starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "those groups with agn components tend to have their agn concentrated within the group core .",
    "this is likely since agn tend to be found within luminous and early type galaxies .",
    "several diagnostic tools are available to probe the nature of the activity within the central region . the ratio of the integrated pah luminosity and the 40 to 120 @xmath0 m ir luminosity @xcite provides a tool to discriminate between starbursts , agn and normal galaxies because the lower the ratio , the more active the galaxy . for ngc 1741",
    ", the ratio is 0.08 and is consistent with the values found for other starbursts @xcite .",
    "similarly , the ratio of the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah flux to the continuum level at this wavelength can provide a measure of the level of activity within the nucleus @xcite .",
    "the ratio for ngc 1741 is 3.5 and is indicative of an active starburst . the results from these diagnostic tools indicate that ngc 1741 is home to a compact burst of star formation and that an agn is not required within the central region of the merging galaxies hcg 31 a and c.      coziol et al . ( 1998b ) discuss a possible galaxy evolution scenario for the hcgs .",
    "the first phase involves triggering of starbursts due to mergers , as in hcg 31 .",
    "when the galaxy s mass is high enough and a large enough gas reservoir is available , the gas falls inwards towards the centre to form and nourish an agn .",
    "as the starburst fades , the agn can remain as a seyfert or liner depending on the amount of gas available and the level of accretion .",
    "when the gas reservoir has finally dissipated , a low luminosity agn or a normal galaxy may be the final result .",
    "most hcgs are dominated by such low luminosity agns or non - active galaxies in their cores indicating that the activity in the system has passed and they are now in a quieter phase .    as regards the eventual fate of hcg 31",
    ", models by barnes ( 1989 ) suggest that after continuing mergers , the final result will be an elliptical galaxy .",
    "after star formation activity has ceased and the remaining stars have evolved , the luminosity will fade @xcite .",
    "the hcg 31 group sits within a large common h i envelope totaling @xmath3 10@xmath22 m@xmath23 of gas , which may end up within the center of the object where it can fuel a starburst or an agn .",
    "given such a large gas reservoir , and the lack of an agn within the central burst of hcg 31 , it would seem that hcg 31 is in the early stages of such a scenario .",
    "the 14.3/6.75 @xmath0 m and 14.3/7.7 @xmath0 m flux ratios ( where the 6.75 @xmath0 m flux was synthesized from pht - s measurements ) suggest that the central burst within ngc 1741 may be moving towards the post - starburst phase .",
    "the ratio of the integrated pah luminosity to the 40 to 120 @xmath0 m infrared luminosity and the far - infrared colours reveal that despite the high surface brightness of the nucleus , the properties of hcg 31 can be explained in terms of a starburst and do not require the presence an agn .",
    "the star tyc 04758 - 466 - 1 , with m@xmath1 = 11.3 and spectral type f6 was detected at 7.7@xmath0 m and 14.3 @xmath0 m .",
