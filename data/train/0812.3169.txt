    "it is quite hard nowadays to realise the atmosphere of skepticism and indifference in the 1980s to proposed searches for extra - solar planets .",
    "some people felt that such an undertaking was not even a legitimate part of astronomy .",
    "it was against such a background that we began our precise radial velocity ( prv ) survey of certain bright solar - type stars in 1980 at the canada france hawaii 3.6-m telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "up to that time , the only serious searches for extra - solar planets had been astrometric studies that looked for long term periodic displacements of stars on the sky caused by unseen companions .",
    "unfortunately , the tiny angular displacements were much smaller than the proper motions and parallaxes for nearby stars and beyond the capability of ground - based astrometric telescopes using photographic emulsions .    for a circular planetary orbit ,",
    "the semi - angular reflex displacement , @xmath6 , of the parent star on the sky caused by a companion planet is : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the distance of the planet from its parent star in au , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the planet and stellar masses in jovian and solar masses , respectively .",
    "@xmath11 is the distance of the star from the earth in parsecs .",
    "@xmath6 increases linearly with @xmath8 ( and as the @xmath12 power of the period ) . for the sun - jupiter system seen from a distance of 5 pc",
    ", @xmath6 would be @xmath131 milli - arcsec and take nearly 12 years to complete a cycle .",
    "considering that the average ground - based photographic image was spread over @xmath141000 milli - arcsec , the challenge of detecting such a miniscule displacement over several decades is obvious .",
    "nonetheless , tentative extra - solar planetary discoveries were claimed for several nearby stars from astrometry with the sproul observatory 24 inch refractor , but the signals were close to the errors of measurement .",
    "the best known identifications were for barnard s star @xcite .",
    "the orbital periods in all cases were close to multiples of 8 years , and @xcite demonstrated that the epochs of the ` discontinuities ' in the sproul data coincided with times when the telescope primary lens had been removed for cleaning .",
    "the amplitude of the periodic reflex variation of a planet - hosting star s radial velocity complements the astrometric variation .",
    "again , for circular orbits , the amplitude of the stellar radial velocity change , @xmath15 , would be : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the inclination of the orbital axis to the line of sight and the units are the same as those in equation 1 .",
    "the radial velocity excursion is independent of the distance from the earth and increases inversely as @xmath18 . as a star , @xmath15 for the sun as caused by jupiter",
    "would be @xmath1913 m s@xmath20 over 12 years when viewed at @xmath17=0 .",
    "unlike astrometry , radial velocities favor the detection of tightly bound planets .    in the early 1970s ,",
    "quality radial velocities determined from photographic plates had typical errors of @xmath131 km s@xmath20 .",
    "the large error was in part due to the photographic process but , more seriously , to the effect of guiding errors at the spectrograph slit which cause the stellar spectrum to shift relative to the bracketting comparison arc lines . obviously , an improvement of more than an order of magnitude coupled with a long term stability of years , was necessary if radial velocities were to be useful in looking for extra - solar jovian analogs .",
    "the above comments also reflect the belief at the time that planetary systems beyond the solar system would most likely be similar to our own , a belief strongly bolstered by theoretical simulations even down to the titus bode relation @xcite ! no one predicted the populations of jovian planets in few - day , or highly elliptical , orbits which eventually turned up . as a result , early search strategies concentrated on long - term monitoring with observations spaced out over months and years .",
    "development of digital tv systems for astronomical spectroscopy began at ubc in 1969 .",
    "these evolved from conventional cameras with electron - beam read - out to self - scanned silicon diode arrays @xcite .",
    "access to the horizontal mckellar coud spectrograph fed by the 1.2-m dominion astrophysical observatory ( dao ) telescope provided a perfect laboratory in which to test our cameras @xcite .    with conventional tv cameras , electron reading - beam jitter and",
    "beam - bending are serious problems in maintaining fidelity of stellar line positions in the digitised spectra .",
    "these errors were in addition to those from guiding - although the introduction of the richardson ( 1966 ) image slicer significantly reduced the latter .",
    "glaspey and fahlman ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) demonstrated that one could use telluric water vapor lines to correct for all of these shifts , raising the possibility of achieving the true radial velocity precision inherent in the original data .",
    "the use of telluric lines was not a new idea ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , but it was particularly appropriate to the case of digital spectra of wide dynamic range and high signal to noise , and i realised that it raised the possibility of sufficient precision to look for extra - solar planets .",
    "the introduction of self - scanned diode arrays eliminated all of the problems with electron beams and made the planet search a serious possibility .",
    "bruce campbell who joined me as a post - doctoral fellow picked up on the idea and took it a step further by suggesting a captive gas . on the recommendation of alexander douglas and gerhard herzberg of the canadian national research council herzberg institute of astrophysics , hydrogen fluoride ( hf )",
    "was chosen because the 30 vibration band has a well spaced comb of lines with no confusion from isotopic shifts , the lines are of similar natural width to those in the stellar spectra , and there are no telluric lines contaminating the @xmath218700 region .",
    "bruce and i @xcite set up an absorption cell just ahead of the mckellar spectrograph slit on 27 december 1978 to try the first ` stellar ' observations .",
    "frankly , it was quite unsafe .",
    "hf is highly corrosive and toxic .",
    "the cell had to be heated to 100 c to prevent the hf from polymerising and the cell windows being plexiglass ( hf attacks glass ) warped with the heat .",
    "nonetheless , we took a series of exposures of the sun with the telescope mirror covers closed - enough light got through the gaps between the covers to give us a good signal from the 1024 reticon diode array .",
    "it worked !",
    "thanks to the small spectral shift program developed by fahlman and glaspey we were able quickly to analyse the spectral series and demonstrate that hf fiducial lines could in principle reduce radial velocity errors by the necessary order of magnitude from those being determined photographically . one important aspect of the captive gas technique ( as opposed to the use of telluric lines )",
    "is that stellar spectra can also be taken with the absorption cell out of the light beam to provide a template spectrum against which to determine differential velocities .",
    "further , unlike the situation with telluric lines , spectra of the captive gas can be taken independently with a continuum source to allow the hf lines to be carefully aligned and removed from the stellar spectra . examples of stellar spectra with and without the hf lines are shown in figure 1 @xcite .",
    "@xcite was probably the first to use a captive gas , i@xmath22 , to determine wavelength shifts accurately in solar spectra ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite later adopted i@xmath22 for their very extensive prv program .",
    "it should be emphasised that our radial velocities were precise but _ not _ accurate , and only appropriate for measuring differential velocities or the accelerations of the target stars .",
    "the wavelengths of stellar absorption lines depend on conditions in the stellar atmosphere in addition to the star s actual motion .",
    "there are upwelling velocities @xmath131 km s@xmath20 of gasses hotter than their surroundings as well as cooler descending material , leading to the well known granulation pattern on the sun .",
    "we had to assume that the average , weighted surface velocity remained constant ( a doubtful assumption in many cases ) .",
    "the earth itself is in revolution at 30 km s@xmath20 about the solar system barycentre and measured velocities must be corrected for this effect , which can amount to tens of km s@xmath20 between observing runs and changes of several m s@xmath20 during a single exposure .",
    "we had to accurately correct for the latter by estimating the mean time of the exposure weighted by the flux rate of starlight reaching the detector .",
    "the wavelength region covered by the hf lines ( figure 1 ) included one of the red ca ii triplet lines at @xmath218662 .",
    "the strength of this line is sensitive to chromospheric activity .",
    "such activity introduces reversals of variable intensity within the ca ii lines .",
    "we considered this an important bonus because stellar granulation patterns might be affected by magnetic cycles and starspots thereby introducing apparent changes in radial velocity and we would be in a position to calibrate the effect if it existed .",
    "the period of jupiter s orbit and the sunspot cycle are similar for instance .",
    "bruce become a staff astronomer at cfht in 1979 while there he built a safer version of the hf cell with sapphire windows for use with the cfht coud spectrograph .",
    "the latter was a duplicate of the high dispersion mckellar spectrograph , and we , together with stephenson yang , used the hf system at cfht over the following twelve years for prv .",
    "the detector , by then an 1872 diode array , had a correlated double sampling system @xcite based on a design by @xcite which reduced read - out noise to the point where signal to noise was dominated by photon statistics .",
    "full descriptions of the technique and analyses can be found in @xcite and @xcite . to achieve a precision of @xmath1310 m s@xmath20 ( equivalent to 0.006 of a 15@xmath23 m diode spacing ! ) several subtle effects had to be calibrated , in particular the impact of convolving the illumination pattern at the slit with the hf line profiles .",
    "ultimately , there also turned out to be small but significant systematic off - sets in the overall radial velocities between observing runs which could be corrected iteratively only at the end of the whole program .",
    "@xcite carried out the first successful initial program in 1980 using the hf absorption cell on the cfht to determine the low amplitude velocity variations of the @xmath24 scuti star @xmath1 cass .",
    "this was before the high reflectance coud mirror train was installed .",
    "the wavelengths of the hf lines , close to @xmath218700 , coincide with a region of reduced reflectivity for aluminum resulting in only some 10% overall transmission , a situation soon remedied by the introduction of enhanced silver coatings .",
    "this preliminary exercise gave us experience and helped to improve the associated reduction programs .",
    "the results for @xmath1 cass demonstrated to the satisfaction of successive telescope time assignment committees that the hf prv technique was indeed viable .",
    "there were two parts to the prv observing list .",
    "five bright giant and one super - giant k stars were included because they were regulary observed around the world as radial velocity standards .",
    "the basic observing list consisted of 23 solar main sequence and sub - giant stars visible from cfht @xcite .",
    "known spectroscopic binaries , rapid rotators and stars earlier than f5 were excluded .",
    "the stars are listed in table 1 .",
    "@xmath25 is the parallax in asec , the i magnitude corresponds most closely to the wavelength of the hf spectral region , and the total number of observations made of each star is in the final column .",
    ".the ubc prv program stars [ cols=\">,>,^,^,<,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we applied twice each year for telescope time and were generally assigned four pairs of nights per year - although one year we received none in the first six months and the tac forced us eventually to drop the giants from the program and reduced us to three pairs of nights per year . with the mindset that we were waiting for planetary signals with characteristic signals of a decade , it really was tedious because there could be no obvious results from any one observing run and , perhaps more seriously , no publications to nourish research funds",
    ". nonetheless , we did persist for 12 years and , it seems , made some exo - planetary discoveries in the process - but it took some time for these to dawn because none was a simple case .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the chromospheric activity of the individual program stars could be quantified from changes in the equivalent width of the chromospherically - sensitive , singly ionised calcium triplet lines one of which , at @xmath218662 , was included in our spectra .",
    "details of how the index was formed are given in @xcite .",
    "basically , differences from a mean ca ii profile derived from all of the spectra were expressed as @xmath26ew@xmath27 in picometer units ( 1 pm = 10@xmath28  ) .",
    "we expected that there might be a correlation between @xmath26ew@xmath27 and excursions in the prv curve .",
    "our observations of @xmath4 cet appeared to support this idea in dramatic fashion as one can see in figure 2 , where @xmath26ew@xmath27 and the prv values are scaled and plotted on the same diagram .",
    "the errors on the values of @xmath26ew@xmath27 are similar to the size of the points while for the prv values they are @xmath1913 m s@xmath20 .",
    "the two quantities track each other surprisingly well , particularly through the , as yet unexplained , s - shape excursion in 1988 .    in figure 3 the individual prv and @xmath26ew@xmath27",
    "are plotted against each other . despite the increasing scatter at large prv values",
    ", there is clearly a significant correlation which was to lead to legitimate doubts about the apparent planetary prv signatures for some chromospherically active stars and whether a correction based on the @xmath4 cet correlation was valid .",
    "ultimately , we did not apply any such correction because there was no clear case for any other star .",
    "later observations of @xmath4 cet by @xcite and @xcite showed that not only is the star chromospherically active , but that it is spotted and rotates differentially and the chromospheric activity is modulated at a rotational period of 9.3 d. they found no obvious rotational modulation of radial velocity and pointed out that the @xmath29=24.4 m s@xmath20 found over 11 yr by @xcite would allow a jovian planet in a tidally locked orbit to remain undiscovered .",
    "one might also speculate that the significant prv and @xmath26ew@xmath27 excursion seen in 1988 lasting some 30 d might have been induced by close periastron passage of a planet in a highly eccentric orbit by the mechanism suggested by @xcite and for which @xcite later found evidence in hd 179949 and @xmath30 and .",
    "for good reason , current prv searches try to avoid chromospherically active stars , but that does not mean they do not harbour planets !      from initial prv results one had to conclude that the so - called standards were all variable in radial velocity while most of the program stars were constant ! while the range of variability in the giants was not serious enough to prevent their use as standards for conventional photographic radial velocities , their radial velocities varied between 30 and 300 m s@xmath20 with periods @xmath131 year .",
    "we published these results @xcite after 5 years to point out that the yellow giants were a new class of radial velocity variable .",
    "in particular , arcturus showed a range of periods from days to nearly two years @xcite .",
    "because of the sizes of the giant stars , it was assumed that their long rotation periods contributed part of the long - term variability .",
    "as prv results for the giants accumulated , the repitition of some variability bore the signature expected from perturbation by jovian companions in circular orbits , particularly in the case of @xmath1 gem @xcite where we eventually extended the cfht prv series to mid-1993 with hf observations from the dao .",
    "for @xmath1 gem , some eight cycles of a 584.7 day period emerged with an amplitude of 46 m s@xmath20 that could correspond to a companion with @xmath31sin@xmath17=2.5 m@xmath32 ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "@xcite had also reported variable radial velocities for three k giants , one of which was pollux(=@xmath1 gem ) and , in 2006 , @xcite published the 25 year radial velocity curve shown in figure 4 .",
    "the velocities include the cfht and dao hf prv values and extended observations from the mcdonald and thuringia state , observatories .",
    "there is a clear 589.6 day period with an amplitude of 41 m s@xmath20 which , for a 1.7 solar - mass primary corresponds to m@xmath33sin@xmath17=2.3 m@xmath32 with the planet in a nearly circular orbit ( _ e _ = 0.02 ) and a semi - major axis of 1.6 au .",
    "the persistance of the 589.6 day signal ruled out pulsational or rotational variability of the star as plausible , alternate explanations .",
    "there seems little doubt about the reality of this planetary identification .",
    "after six years , we @xcite published interim prv results for 12 solar main sequence stars and 4 sub - giants .",
    "unfortunately , our suggestion in that paper that statistically significant long - term trends for seven of the stars might represent ` the tip of the planetary mass spectrum ' only seemed to intensify skepticism about the possibility of extra - solar jovian planets .",
    "@xmath0 cep and @xmath2 eri were two of the candidates .",
    "sometime later , bruce campbell , who had been unable to secure a permanent position in astronomy , left the project .",
    "alan irwin stepped in to help with the data analysis and we @xcite eventually published a final analysis for 22 stars based on the full 12 years of observations .",
    "( published in icarus because they had no page charges and by then we had exhausted our publication funds ! ) by that time , @xcite had published their detection of terrestrial - mass planets orbiting the 6.2-ms pulsar psr b1257 + 12 , but it was just prior to the dramatic announcement of the jovian - mass planet orbiting 51 peg with a 4.23 d period by @xcite .",
    "ironically , the latter discovery was made without the benefit of captive gas fiducials but relied on a highly stable spectrograph with a stable line spread function and comparison arc lines .",
    "there were several obvious conclusions from our twelve years of prv observations .",
    "while we had detected two previously unknown spectroscopic binaries ( @xmath0 cep and @xmath34 ori ) there was no evidence for brown dwarf companions to any of our stars similar to , or more massive than , that found by @xcite associated with hd 114762 .",
    "this apparent brown dwarf ` desert ' had turned up in other studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "several stars such as @xmath35 cet had shown surprisingly little change in radial velocity over the 12 years while others had proved much more noisy suggesting a higher level of surface activity .    in our 1995 paper",
    ", we struck a more conservative note than in 1988 , concluding that there was no strong evidence for any jovian planets in circular orbits with periods of years associated with any of our stars - a conclusion reinforced by the lack of detections by other groups .",
    "however , we did draw attention to two candidates , @xmath0 cep and @xmath2 eri , where the stellar velocity curves could indeed be interpreted as due to jovian planets .",
    "neither case was simple , which is why they remained in doubt until the excellent follow - up work of the texas planet searchers led by bill cochran @xcite .",
    "we had found @xcite that @xmath0 cep was a single - line spectroscopic binary from a ` large ' systematic change in its radial velocity , but our observations covered only part of the binary orbit ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "subsequently , @xcite was able to assign an orbital period of 67 yr to the system from much more extended radial velocity measurements .",
    "recently , @xcite actually imaged the faint second star with the aid of adaptive optics on the subaru telescope - it is likely an m4 dwarf .",
    "the interest to us was less in the stellar binary than in the 2.5 yr ` ripple ' superimposed on the velocity curve seen best perhaps in figure 5 taken from @xcite that shows the radial velocity curve from the first 11 years of the program . on removing a low - order - polynomial to account for the reflex motion of the primary caused the long period stellar binary orbit , there was an underlying periodicity from which @xcite had suggested ` probable third body variation of 25 m s@xmath20 amplitude , 2.7 yr period , superimposed on a large velocity gradient ' . with the 11 year curve ,",
    "the periodicity in the residuals was much clearer , and the period was refined to 2.52 years .",
    "but was it a planet or an effect of the star s rotation ? at the time , rotation seemed a slightly more plausible explanation because of a very weak almost synchronous chromospheric activity signal coupled with a misclassification of the primary as a giant .",
    "there was also the implausibility that there would be a stable planetary orbit in such a close stellar binary , and the then prevelant view that jovian planets would not survive so close to such a large primary .",
    "unfortunately , our best guess at a binary orbital period of @xmath1330 yr later proved too short @xcite , and @xcite established that the primary was a k1 iv sub - giant , not a giant .",
    "both of these developments undercut any stellar origin for the periodic variations .",
    "ultimately @xcite , by extending measurements of prv and chromospheric activity to 2002 at the mcdonald observatory , demonstrated that the 2.5 yr period in the residuals had repeated like clockwork and that there was in fact no long - term synchronous chromospheric activity .",
    "this is shown dramatically in figure 6 where the 22 years of differential radial velocities corrected for the velocity changes induced by the stellar binary are shown for each of the cfht and three mcdonald programs .",
    "zero - point corrections were introduced between each of the four series for continuity .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the m4 dwarf secondary star is in an eccentric 66.8 yr orbit ( @xmath36 = 0.41 ) with a semimajor axis of 19 au .",
    "the minimum mass of the planetary companion to the primary is 1.4 m@xmath32 .",
    "the planetary orbit is only 9.8 times smaller than the orbit of the secondary star ( the smallest ratio known among exoplanet host stars in multiple systems at this time ) , but it is stable if the two orbits are coplanar .",
    "so , arguably we detected the first exo - planet prv signature for a jovian planet in a quite unexpected system - a binary star , but it was at a characteristically jovian distance from its primary .",
    "@xmath2 eri is a young @xcite , magnetically active star @xcite which rotates twice as fast as the sun .",
    "it also has spots and the rotation is differential @xcite . as a result ,",
    "its integrated surface velocity changes make it a ` noisy ' target producing a considerable intrinsic scatter in radial velocity . despite the ` noise '",
    ", there appeared to be a consistent @xmath1310 yr period in the ubc prv , but the time baseline was too short to confirm this . from observations at mcdonald , lick and eso observatories , @xcite extended coverage to 2000 .",
    "the periodicity was still present , and they derived a period of 6.9 yr with an amplitude of 19 m s@xmath20 corresponding to a minimum planetary mass of 0.9 jupiter in an eccentric orbit ( @xmath36=0.6 ) .",
    "figure 7 shows the radial velocity curve extended to 2006 by @xcite , who combined these values with three years of astrometric measurements of milliarsecond precision taken with the hst .",
    "the noisiness of the radial velocity observations is obvious and the astrometry covers less than half an orbit .",
    "by 1993 , when our prv program ended , the hf technique had passed its prime .",
    "our observing list was necessarily small because the 100    coverage was an order of magnitude less than with i@xmath22 vapor and ccd arrays coupled to an chelle spectral format ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , @xcite had even demonstrated that with sufficient care one could perhaps dispense with an absorption cell altogether .",
    "the handling and preparation of the hf system was also dangerous .",
    "on the other hand , the hf system had been straight - forward to implement . the natural width and spacing of the hf lines",
    "had avoided the additional layer of processing necessary with the sharp overlapping i@xmath22 lines .",
    "the photometric fidelity of the diode arrays was ideal , and we already had a ` small - shift ' progam in place as a basis for the analysis .",
    "our early success in reducing prv errors had , we liked to think , encouraged other groups to press on .",
    "as with any new level of precision , our prv turned up unexpected results such as the variability of the yellow giants , the correlated variations of the prv and chromospheric activity in @xmath4 cet , and a paucity of close brown dwarf companions .",
    "these finds complicated interpretation of our results for the program stars .",
    "above all , a general skepticism still greeted any announcement of an exo - planet discovery .",
    "nonetheless , three stars that we flagged as possible planet hosts , @xmath0 cep , @xmath1 gem , and @xmath2 eri were later confirmed by the texas group , albeit not everyone is yet convinced about @xmath2 eri b despite the complementary astrometric acceleration detected by @xcite . in simple terms , roughly some 10% of our program stars turned out to have jovian planets with orbital periods of years .",
    "this roughly matches the statistics from the current huge sample of stars being monitored by others ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although each of our three candidates was unusual .      the success of our extra - solar planet search depended on many people , but particularly on bruce campbell , stephenson yang , alan irwin and ron johnson who built successive low - noise versions of the reticon camera systems",
