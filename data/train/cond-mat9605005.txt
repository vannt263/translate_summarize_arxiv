    "the experimental determination of the optical properties of bulk semiconductors can now be obtained with high precision @xcite , yet our theoretical understanding is far from complete .",
    "the static dielectric constant , which can be obtained from a functional derivative of the electron density with respect to the total kohn - sham potential evaluated at the ground state , hence a ground state property , is over estimated by the local - density approximation ( lda ) calculation @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the gradient correction to the pseudopotential lda reduces slightly the discrepancy in the case of silicon @xcite .",
    "the underestimation of the @xmath3 peak and the overestimation of the @xmath4 peak of the imaginary part of the dielectric function , @xmath5 , by one - electron band theory have generated theoretical work for almost two decades to account for these discrepancies .",
    "it was clear from the beginning that including excitonic effects , which have been detected experimentally @xcite , could remove some of the disagreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "however , the model calculations used to correct @xmath6 have produced only a qualitative understanding of the problem .",
    "in particular , the latest model by hanke , mattausch and strinati based on the time - dependent screened hartree - fock approximation and including both the local field and the excitonic effects , described correctly the @xmath3 peak but underestimated significantly the @xmath4 peak of si .",
    "the reason for the underestimation of @xmath4 was attributed to a bad representation of the band structure of si by their slater - koster parameterization @xcite . del castello - mussot and sham @xcite based their latest calculation on a @xmath7 model around the l point ( where @xmath3 originates ) and a multiple plane - wave model around the x points ( where @xmath4 originates ) , and solved the bethe - salpeter equation containing the excitonic effect .",
    "their model is an improvement over the non - interacting approximation : the @xmath3 peak becomes stronger and the @xmath4 peak weaker .",
    "this model is very promising , but , being based on a @xmath7 approximation to the band structure , it provided only a qualitative correction to the intensities of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 structures .",
    "calculations ignoring excitonic effects , but including the local - field effect , underestimated both @xmath3 and @xmath4 peaks @xcite .",
    "one way to make theoretical progress in this field is to determine the correct contribution of the one - electron theory to the optical properties of semiconductors .",
    "this allows us to define precisely the size of the many body corrections to the one electron theory .",
    "however , a common belief these days is that the eigenvalues and vectors of the kohn - sham ( ks ) equations @xcite have no direct physical meaning and hence should not be used to calculate optical spectra of materials .",
    "only ground state properties derived from the total energy as a function of the electron density have in principle a direct physical meaning .    while lda was indeed intended to calculate ground state properties it could also be viewed as a simplified quasi - particle ( qp ) theory where the self - energy is local and static ( @xmath8 , here @xmath9 is the local exchange and correlation potential as , for example , parameterized by von barth and hedin @xcite .",
    "the ks eigenvalues are then qp energies and could be compared to experimental data .",
    "this argument is supported by calculations using the gw approximation of hedin@xcite .",
    "these calculations showed that the valence qp energies of semiconductors are in good agreement with lda and the conduction qp energies differ by approximately a rigid energy shift @xcite . in the literature this shift is often called `` scissors - operator '' shift ( sos ) @xcite .",
    "first - principles local density approximation calculations started more than two decades ago , but the major problem of lda , beside the well understood energy band gap problem@xcite , is the numerical difficulty to determine selfconsistent electronic structure and optical matrix elements using a complete basis - set",
    ". the early ab - initio calculation of the optical properties of semiconductors by wang and klein , using a selfconsistent linear combination of gaussian orbitals produced static dielectric functions in good agreement with experiment@xcite . but",
    "this agreement is fortuitous because the band gaps produced by this method are much larger than the lda band gaps",
    ". the recent calculations of 18 semiconductors by huang and ching using an orthogonalized linear combination of atomic orbitals method produced lda static dielectric functions which are in general smaller than experiment despite the fact that their band gaps are much larger than the all - electron or pseudopotential lda band gaps @xcite .",
    "those underestimated static dielectric constants are most likely due to the incompleteness of the basis - set used in their calculations .",
    "most of the theoretical studies of the optical properties of semiconductors in the literature use several approximations within the lda , ranging from the use of spherical potentials @xcite to the use of pseudopotentials @xcite instead of all electron lda potentials . in this paper",
    "we report precise calculations of the optical properties of bulk semiconductors si , ge , and gaas under hydrostatic pressure using an all electron lda linear muffin - tin orbital basis - set@xcite , in which no shape approximation is made for either the potential or the charge density @xcite . the semi - core @xmath1 of ga and ge are included in a fully hybridizing valence basis set , and the rest of the core states are allowed to relax selfconsistently .",
    "the effect of spin - orbit coupling is also investigated .",
    "a systematic check of the @xmath10-sum rule is performed for all the calculations .",
    "we hope that this accurate lda calculation will provide an excellent starting point for the determination of the local field and the excitonic effects in the optical spectra of semiconductors @xcite .",
    "we have found that the static dielectric function , @xmath2 , which is a ground state property , is overestimated by lda over all pressure range , and that an excellent agreement with the experimental results of goi and coworkers @xcite for @xmath2 of gaas and ge under hydrostatic pressure is achieved only when the so - called scissors - operator shift is used to account for the correct band gap at @xmath0 .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath1 semi - core states of ge and gaas in the interband transition has almost no significant effects in @xmath2 ; however , the @xmath1 interband transitions contribute significantly to the magnitude of @xmath11 above 25 ev for ge , and above 12 ev for gaas .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling increases the lda values by about few percents .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the method of calculation of electronic structure and the macroscopic dielectric function based on our all - electron full - potential lmto basis - set . in section iii we present the electronic properties of si , ge , and gaas and compare them to existing theoretical results . the calculated dielectric functions and a discussion about including the semi - core states and the spin - orbit coupling will be presented in section iv . in the same section",
    "we also compare our static dielectric function under hydrostatic pressure with the experimental results of goi _ et al .",

    "we describe the bloch wave function inside the so - called muffin - tin spheres and the interstititial region .",
    "a correct determination of the crystal wave function is necessary for the accurate determination of the optical matrix elements .    as for the cellular methods",
    ", the space is divided into non - overlapping muffin - tin spheres surrounding atomic sites where the schrdinger or the dirac equation for each principle quantum number @xmath12 and momentum channel @xmath13 is solved for a fixed energy @xmath14 . in these muffin - tin spheres",
    "the trial wave function is linearized in terms of the solution of schrdinger equation @xmath15 and its energy derivative @xmath16 for the energy @xmath14 , and for an atom of type @xmath17 and momentum channel @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the bloch wave function of site @xmath17 calculated at site @xmath18 in the unit cell of the crystal at @xmath19 is given by @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are renormalized structure constants obtained from the crystal structure constants @xmath23 to ensure that the bloch wave function is continuous and differentiable at the boundary of each muffin - tin sphere .    in the interstitial region ,",
    "the muffin - tin orbitals are spherical wave solutions @xmath24 to the helmholtz equation with non - zero kinetic energy ; these bases are hankel functions for negative kinetic energies or neumann functions for positive kinetic energies @xmath25 .",
    "such that each partial wave inside the muffin - tin sphere is allowed to have different kinetic energy , @xmath26 , in the interstitial region . in this region",
    "the bloch wave function is given by : @xmath27 the interstitial - region bloch function is expressed in plane waves over the reciprocal lattice using fourier transform :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 , here the parameter @xmath30 is the linearization energy of the wave function in the muffin - tin sphere for the @xmath13 momentum channel , @xmath31 is the azumutal quantum number , and @xmath32 is the variational parameter whose square is the kinetic energy in the interstitial region .",
    "the fourier coefficients , @xmath33 , are obtained from a pseudo - wave function that is equal to the crystal wave function in the interstitial region and represented by a smooth function inside the muffin - tin spheres .",
    "the exact shape of these pseudo - functions inside the muffin - tin spheres is not important .",
    "the only requirement is that they are continuous and differentiable at the sphere boundary and have zero slop at the origin of each sphere .",
    "the plane wave expansion is multiplied by a three dimensional step function so that the wave function is kept only in the interstitial region .",
    "the knowledge of the bloch wave function in the whole unit cell allows us to calculate the hamiltonian and overlap matrix elements in order to solve the effective one electron schrdinger equation .",
    "three different kinetic energies were used for each subset of _ s _ and _ p _ derived bases in the basis set ; two kinetic energies were used for bases derived from orbital parameters @xmath34 .",
    "the basis sets used in calculating total energies and structural properties were for si : 3(3_s_3_p _ ) , 2(3_d _ ) , for ge : 2(3_d _ ) , 3(4_s_4_p _ ) ,",

    "the basis functions for each material comprised a single , fully hybridizing basis set .",
    "note the presence of both 3_d _ and 4_d _ derived bases on ga and ge .",
    "a useful feature of the method used in these calculations is the ability to incorporate basis functions derived from the same orbital atomic quantum numbers but different principal atomic quantum numbers in a single fully hybridizing basis set .",
    "this feature entails the use of multiple sets of radial functions to represent bases with different principle atomic quantum numbers .",
    "this capability was particularly useful in calculating the high - lying energy bands which were used to obtain the dielectric functions to high energy ; the basis sets employed for this purpose are given in table i. seven to eight kinetic energies were used in the basis sets .",
    "accurate resolution of the bands to high energy was necessary to converge the calculation of the real part of the dielectric function , which was obtained from the imaginary part through the kramers - kronig relation .",
    "an interesting consequence of the relaxation of the ga 3_d _ states as valence states is a significant decrease in the calculated band gap @xcite .    for the core charge density ,",
    "the dirac equation is solved selfconsistently , e.g. , no frozen core approximation is used .",
    "the exchange and correlation potential is treated within the von barth and hedin parameterization @xcite . to account for the relativistic effects in the dielectric function , the full - selfconsistent relativistic band structure",

    "the completeness of basis - set , with different variational @xmath32 values for each partial wave in the interstitial region together with the fourier representation allows the method to treat open structures like the zinc - blende structure studied here without having to resort to the so - called empty spheres @xcite .",
    "the high energy states are also determined more accurately due to the use of many @xmath32 values . as a test",

    "this is not surprising because the higher excited states which are free electrons like are most probably well described by lda and need no scissors operator shift .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the the energy - loss function , -im@xmath109 , within the lda has it maximum roughly at the free electron plasmon frequency whereas within the scissors approximation its maximum is shifted to higher energies as given by equation ( [ intsumruleqp ] ) .",

    "the @xmath4 peak is overestimated by lda by about 34% for si , 50% for ge , and 60% for gaas .",
    "this overestimation of the @xmath4 peak by lda is due to a strong van hove singularity near the x points of the brillouin zone where parallel bands occur over a large plateau @xcite .",

    "whereas for gaas , the onset of transitions begun at 12 ev , and the intensity @xmath93 spectrum above 12 ev is very different from the empty @xmath116 states of ga .",

    "ix we present our calculation for the static dielectric function of si , ge , and gaas including the spin - orbit coupling effect at the variational level , and the effect of the 3@xmath110 states in the interband transitions . the calculated potential includes always the @xmath1 states , and only the dielectric function is calculated with or without the @xmath1 interband transitions .",
    "we have obtained that the inclusion of the @xmath1 interband transitions increases slightly the static dielectric function , whereas the spin - orbit coupling increases it by 2.1% and 3.2% for ge and gaas , respectively .",
    "the @xmath2 of si is insensitive to the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the calculated scissors - operator shift @xmath2 including the spin - orbit coupling effect decreases by about 3.3%   and 4.1%   for ge and gaas , respectively .",
    "this is because the band gaps of ge and gaas are further reduced in presence of spin - orbit coupling which resulted in a larger scissors - operator shift for the determination of @xmath122 .",
    "the macroscopic dielectric function in the random - phase - approximation without local field effect has been implemented using the local density approximation with an all electron , full - potential linear muffin - tin orbital orbital basis - set .",
    "the method is used to calculate the optical properties of the semiconductors , si , ge , and gaas , under hydrostatic pressure . we have found that the lda overestimation the static dielectric function over all the pressure range from 0 to 12 gpa , and that a single value of the so called scissors - operator shift which account for the correct band gap at @xmath0 produced a good agreement with the experimental data of goi and coworkers @xcite .",
    "this makes us conclude that because lda underestimates the band gap it is incapable of producing the correct static dielectric function even though @xmath2 is a ground state property .",
    "since ( i ) the kohn - sham ( ks ) density functional ( df ) without the local density approximation should in principle produce the correct @xmath2 , and ( ii ) since the lda calculation with the scissors - operator shift also produces the correct @xmath2 , we are tempted to conclude that the ks - df theory should produce the correct band gap for semiconductors .",
    "this conclusion is not confirmed by a non - selfconsistent gw calculations which suggest that the true ks - df theory also underestimates the band gap @xcite .",
    "our analysis of the dielectric function , the sum rules and the energy - loss function shows that while the scissors - operator shift is a good approximation for the low lying excited states it appears as bad approximation for the high energy excited states .",
    "this is because the high energy states are free electron like hence well described within lda .",
    "our calculation of the dynamical dielectric function shows that the @xmath3 peak intensity is underestimated for si by about 50% , and for ge and gaas by only 12% .",
    "these results imply that the excitonic effects may be important for the dielectric function of si , but less for those for ge , and gaas .",
    "we have also shown that including the @xmath1 semi - core states in the interband transitions hardly changes the static dielectric function , @xmath2 , however their contribution to the intensity of dynamical dielectric function for higher photon energies is substantial , and could be checked experimentally .",
    "we have also found that the spin - orbit coupling has a significant effect on @xmath2 of ge and gaas , but not of si .",
