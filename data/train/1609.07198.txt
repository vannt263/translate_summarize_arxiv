    "recently , the experiment of krasznahorkay _ et al_. studied the decays of a @xmath0 excited state to its ground state and found a bump in both the opening angle and invariant mass distributions of @xmath1 pairs produced in the transitions  @xcite .",
    "this 6.8@xmath2 deviation from the expectation can be fitted by the production of a new particle @xmath7 of mass around 17 mev in the transition @xmath8 and the subsequent decay of @xmath7 into electron - positron pair .",
    "although the excess can be due to unknown nuclear effects , the existence of a new particle was investigated in  @xcite from different aspects .",
    "it is shown that the proton coupling to @xmath7 is suppressed , or the @xmath7 boson is @xmath9 , in order to alleviate various experimental constraints for a new light gauge boson  @xcite . some anomaly free phenomenological models are also proposed in refs .",
    "furthermore , simple models involving new scalar or pseudo - scalar particles are excluded as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we take the new particle as a @xmath4 gauge boson corresponding to a new @xmath10 gauge symmetry . the charge",
    "@xmath11 can be a completely hidden quantum number governing the dark sector or a certain combination of standard model ( sm ) quantum numbers .",
    "hence the @xmath4 boson plays as a portal between the dark sector and visible sector .",
    "a simple dark photon model containing two parameters @xmath12 has been ruled out by confronting various experiments both in quark sector and lepton sector @xcite .",
    "the dark @xmath5 model , however , has one more parameter @xmath13 which is induced by the mass mixing between @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "this mixing allows interactions between @xmath4 and fermions including neutrinos .",
    "then it is a natural and interesting topic to discuss the possibility of this more generic model . in the following sections",
    ", we will show that the hidden gauge boson couples to proton ( neutron ) and electron ( neutrino ) in equal strengths . due to",
    "the above coupling relations , we will present explicitly the incompatiblity between the measurement of krasznahorkay _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and texono @xmath14electron scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "since the generic hidden @xmath3 model is disfavored , we also consider non - hidden @xmath3 portal models for further phenomenological studies .",
    "we shall demonstrate that such models are also disfavored by the existing dm direct search data for dm mass above 500 mev . to probe dm lighter than 500 mev in non - hidden models ,",
    "we propose direct searches based upon dm - electron scatterings ..    we organized the paper as follows : in section ii we describe the generic @xmath4 lagrangian and take the @xmath4 boson as the dm force mediator ; in section iii we derive the constraints for the model parameters from the @xmath0 transition and other experiments , in particular texono experiment excludes the simple dark @xmath5 model ; in section iv we investigate the implications of dm direct search with dm - nucleus scatterings and discuss the sensitivities of future si and ge detectors to dm - electron scattering in the framework of non - hidden @xmath3 portal model with the wimp mass between 20 mev and 500 mev ; we then conclude in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we assume that the dark sector interacts among themselves and links the sm particles via a hidden abelian @xmath15 gauge symmetry .",
    "the connection between visible and dark sector is established by the @xmath15 gauge boson @xmath4 through its kinetic mixing with the sm @xmath3 gauge boson @xmath16 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 characterizes the mixing .",
    "the massive gauge bosons @xmath5 and @xmath4 obtain their masses after spontaneous symmetry breaking as well as a further rotation between them .",
    "hereafter for simplicity we keep the same notation @xmath4 to denote the gauge boson of @xmath10 in mass eigenstate . without loss of generality ,",
    "the interaction among @xmath4 and sm fermions can be described phenomenologically as    @xmath19    where @xmath20 , and @xmath13 is some certain combination of @xmath18 and rotation angles , which also depends on uv complete theory and mass generation mechanism .",
    "the electromagnetic current and weak neutral current are @xmath21 respectively , where @xmath22 stands for the fermions with corresponding electric charge @xmath23 , isospin @xmath24 .",
    "more details about this model can be found in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we assume the interaction in dark sector is @xmath25 where the dm @xmath26 is assumed to be dirac fermion carrying a charge @xmath27 under the hidden gauge symmetry .      in fitting to the measurement by krasznahorkay _",
    "et al_. , one obtains the mass of the light boson to be  @xcite @xmath30 therefore , the @xmath4 considered in our framework can only decay into @xmath1 and @xmath31 .",
    "the corresponding decay widths are given by @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively could be a tuning parameter . ] .",
    "we have summed up three flavors of neutrino and the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 are defined as @xmath36 numerically , we have @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively .",
    "the dark @xmath4 interaction with nucleon can be characterized as @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "only the vector current part contributes to the matrix element @xmath44 if parity is conserved .",
    "it is interesting that the couplings for proton and neutron are identical to @xmath45 and @xmath46 except the sign flip by opposite electric charge and weak isospin .",

    "@xcite , two most severe bounds from the search of dark photon in the relevant mass range are obtained by na48/2  @xcite and e141 experiments  @xcite .",
    "na48/2 gives an upper bound requiring @xmath55 at 90% c.l .",
    "we translate the constraint into our framework by interpretting the process as @xmath56 . again",
    "the branching ratio modification is taken into account , @xmath57 e141 is a electron beam dump experiment at slac which searches for a dark photon bremsstrahlung resulting from electrons incident on a nuclear target  @xcite .",
    "the experiment sets a lower bound for the coupling strength in our scenario @xmath58 combining the condition of eq .",

    "the green band is the allowed region to fit the @xmath49 anomaly while the purple shaded and pink shaded areas are excluded by the beam dump and na48/2 experiments , respectively .",
    "one observes that @xmath60 lies within a narrow region between @xmath61 and @xmath62 and @xmath63 is constrained in the range of @xmath64 .",
    "the allowed coupling strength of @xmath4 to proton is relatively smaller than the coupling strength of @xmath4 to neutron .",
    "hence a @xmath9 feature is suggested by the measurement of krasznahorkay _ et al _ ..      for the hidden @xmath3 model",
    ", the same constraints also apply to @xmath66 as shown in eq .",
    "( [ ep = ae ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ en = anu ] ) .",
    "therefore , the constraints from short baseline accelerator and/or reactor neutrino - electron scattering experiments must be taken into account  @xcite .",
    "a global analysis on the nonstandard interactions that are deviated from the sm predictions is presented in ref .",

    "to accommodate the new light gauge boson indicated in @xmath49 anomaly as well as @xmath3 portal scenario , we are led to consider models with non - hidden @xmath3 gauge symmetry and mev - scale dm  mev are viable .",

    "non - hidden @xmath3 charge suggests a certain linear combination of sm quantum number and/or other hidden charge .",
    "phenomenologically , such models will include a new set of direct gauge - fermion couplings .",
    "the interplay between these couplings with the gauge boson mixings will modify the relations among quark and lepton couplings such as eq .",

    "we shall consider other cosmological constraints on @xmath70 .",
    "for cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) the additional injection of energy via the dm annihilations will increase the ionization fraction on the cmb anisotropy .",
    "hence it will suppress the power spectrum at small angular scales due to the broadening of the last scattering surface , and also enhance the polarization power spectra at low multipoles due to the increasing probability of the thomson scattering .",
    "the planck data puts strong bounds on s - wave annihilation cross section for the dm mass in a range of sub - mev to 100 gev  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the constraints are stringent if the fraction of electron final state is non - negligible .",
    "we note that the @xmath49 anomaly indicates a substantial fraction of @xmath71 final state in @xmath4 decays .",
    "in such a case the planck data sets the limits of s - wave @xmath72 for mev - scale dm  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we consider the process , @xmath73 , as the dm annihilation channel in this scenario . in the parity conservation limit , this process is mostly p - wave as pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "we include the sommerfeld enhancement factor  @xcite and find @xmath74 , the analogous fine structure constant for @xmath15 gauge interaction , is about @xmath75 to satisfy the thermal relic abundance .",
    "finally , in order to prevent the photodissociation to alter the light element abundances during the big bang nucleosynthesis , one requires the lifetime of @xmath76 to be less than 1 second in the early universe  @xcite .",
