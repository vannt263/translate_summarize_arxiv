    "as one of the fundamental topics closely related to the concepts of nonlinearity and irreversibility in statistical mechanics  @xcite , heat transport in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems has attracted considerable interest in recent years  @xcite . in this context , one of the central issues is the validity or breakdown of fourier s law , which states , the heat flux @xmath0 is proportional to the temperature gradient @xmath1 : @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the heat conductivity assumed to be a size - independent constant .",
    "generally , it is now well accepted that for 1d anharmonic systems with conserved momentum , the fourier s law is not valid , namely @xmath3 is not a constant but diverges with the system size @xmath4 in a power law @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is believed to follow some universality classes  @xcite , which was supported by some theories  @xcite and numerical simulations  @xcite , and debated by some other studies  @xcite . while it should be noted that if some other factors , like the asymmetric interactions  @xcite , the systems close to the integrable limit  @xcite , the pressure  @xcite , and the multi - well interparticle potential  @xcite , are included ,",
    "whether the fourier s law is still valid / invalid and what are the underlying mechanics , the verification remains in progress .",
    "it is thus necessary to check the heat transport behavior including more complicated factors to seek general conclusions . in the present work we therefore consider a momentum - conserving system with the soft - type ( st ) interparticle interaction , which is a new factor that has not yet been fully taken into account [ compared with the hard - type ( ht ) interactions ] .",
    "our main finding is that , similar to the fermi - pasta - ulam-@xmath8 ( fpu-@xmath8 ) systems with the ht anharmonicity , an anomalous heat transport will be seen at all temperatures . via detailed simulations we also explore the possible microscopic mechanism .",
    "we show that with the increase of the system s temperature , the st interaction induces a special type of nonlinearity , which softens the phonons and reduces their velocities ; while these effects can not qualitatively change the heat transport and its scaling behavior . a careful analysis of the system s momentum spread and phonon spectra indicates an incomplete damping process of phonons very similarly to those exhibited in fpu-@xmath8 systems with ht anharmonicity",
    ". this may be the reason for the anomalous temperature dependent heat transport behavior observed here .",
    "the rest of this work is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the model and compare the st anharmonic interaction with the potentials of harmonic and fpu-@xmath8 ( with ht interaction ) systems .",
    "section iii describes the simulation method .",
    "we use the equilibrium correlation simulation method  @xcite to get the heat spreading information with the temperatures , from which our main results on heat transport and its scaling property are presented in sec .",
    "section v is devoted to the underlying mechanisms . for such purpose",
    "we investigate the system s momentum spread and examine the phonons spectra to explore the phonons damping information . finally , a summary is given in sec .",
    "we consider a 1d many - particle ( @xmath4 particles ) momentum - conserving lattice with hamiltonian @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the @xmath11-th particle s momentum and @xmath12 its displacement from equilibrium position .",
    "the interparticle potential takes a type of soft anharmonicity  @xcite @xmath13 which is shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) and also compared with the harmonic [ @xmath14 and fpu-@xmath8 [ @xmath15 potentials .",
    "-.2 cm -0.4 cm   ( a ) and its associated force ( b ) . for comparison we also plot the counterparts of harmonic ( dashed ) and fpu-@xmath8 ( dotted ) systems.,title=\"fig : \" ] -0.4 cm -0.3 cm    figure 1(b ) plots the associated forces defined by @xmath16 .",
    "as can be seen , opposite to the fpu-@xmath8 system with ht anharmonicity , the st interaction has a restoring force always less than the harmonic force .",
    "this is why we call it st anharmonicity , a special feature of the system .",
    "it induces an unusual energy dependent frequency  @xcite , which has been suggested to strongly modify the distribution , intensity , and mobility of the thermal fluctuations , resulting in a quite different transition dynamics of the underlying activated process  @xcite . with this model here",
    "we aim to explore how this st anharmonicity would play the roles in heat transport .",
    "as mentioned , to identify the heat transport behavior and its scaling property , we here use the equilibrium correlation method  @xcite . for the special st anharmonicity",
    ", it can be expected that the time scale to ensure the system relaxed to the nonequilibrium stationary state would be quite longer than the usually considered fpu-@xmath8 systems with ht anharmonicity .",
    "this would be why the traditional simulation methods , such as the direct nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite and the approach based on the green - kubo formula  @xcite have not yet been used to study such a system , and thus the heat transport law here is still unclear .",
    "the equilibrium correlation method  @xcite employs the following normalized spatiotemporal correlation function of system s heat energy fluctuations to explore the heat spreading information @xmath17 where @xmath18 ; @xmath19 represents the spatiotemporal average ; @xmath20 is the heat energy @xmath21 s fluctuation in an equal and appropriate lattice bin @xmath22 ( the number of particles in the @xmath22-th bin is equal to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the total number of the bins ) . in each bin , @xmath25 with @xmath26  @xcite the single particle s heat energy density at the absolute space @xmath27 and time @xmath28 within the bin , which is closely related to the corresponding energy ( mass ) density @xmath29 under a internal average pressure @xmath30 .    in order to understand the underlying picture",
    ", we also study the momentum spread via the momentum correlation function @xmath31 similarly to the definition of @xmath32 , here @xmath33 denotes the momentum fluctuation .    to calculate the correlation functions , the system is first thermalized to the focused temperature by using the stochastic langevin heat baths  @xcite for a long enough time ( @xmath34 time units of the models ) .",
    "this should be taken from properly assigned initial random states .",
    "then the system is evolved in isolation [ by using the runge - kutta algorithm of @xmath35th to @xmath36th order with a time step @xmath37 for deriving the correlation information .",
    "we use the size of ensemble about @xmath38 .",
    "we consider a wide range of temperatures from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "for each temperature , we set the chain size of @xmath41 , which allows a fluctuation of heat located at the center to spread along the system for a long time at least up to @xmath42 . under this setup , we apply the periodic boundary conditions , fix the bins number @xmath43 ( the choice of @xmath24 has been verified not to affect the final results ) .",
    "now let us see the results of heat spread . in fig .",
    "2 we first plot the profiles of @xmath44 for typical three long time .",
    "four temperatures @xmath45 , from low to high , are employed to explore the temperature dependent behavior . as can be seen , with the increase of @xmath45 , the profile of @xmath44",
    "is changed from a u shape  @xcite to lvy walks  @xcite density , especially that the central parts of the profile become more and more localized .",
    "the u shape here shows slight difference with the usual density in harmonic chain , i.e. , the front parts exhibit some oscillations , which may be caused by the unusual nonlinearity of st anharmonicity under low temperatures .",
    "the lvy walks profiles under high temperatures can be phenomenologically understood from the single particle lvy walks theory with velocity fluctuations  @xcite .",

    "cm    the scaling analysis of @xmath44 is usually focused on the central parts by using the following formula @xmath52 we then use formula ( 5 ) to rescale the profiles as shown in fig . 2 , which enables us to identify a scaling exponent @xmath53 for characterizing the heat spreading s scaling behavior .",
    "we recall here @xmath54 and @xmath55 correspond to ballistic and super - diffusive heat transport , respectively .",
    "now it is clear that the u shape shown at low temperatures [ @xmath56 close to @xmath57 , see fig .",
    "3(a ) ] indicates the ballistic heat transport , while the lvy walks density under high temperatures implies the super - diffusive behavior [ fig .",
    "3(d ) , @xmath58 . for the ballistic regime",
    "the whole density can be perfectly scaled by formula ( 5 ) , both for central and front parts , while in the super - diffusive case , only the central parts are available , which might correspond to the bi - linear scaling property of lvy walks  @xcite .    -.2",

    "cm -0.2 cm    the scaling exponent @xmath53 is of great interest since from which we might get the time scaling exponent of the mean squared deviation of this heat diffusion process and thus connect to the divergence exponent @xmath6 of heat transport  @xcite .",
    "figure 4 depicts @xmath53 versus temperature @xmath45 . therein",
    "four data points are extracted from fig .",
    "3 , others are obtained by performing the same scaling analysis .",
    "the results clearly indicate the temperature dependent @xmath53 exponents though it was usually suggested that @xmath53 should follow two universality classes , i.e. , @xmath59 and @xmath60 predicted by some theories  @xcite .",
    "interestingly such anomalous temperature dependent behavior is similar to that shown in fpu-@xmath8 chain  @xcite , where the nonlinearity dependent @xmath53 exponents crossover between different universality classes have been reported .",
    "-.2 cm -0.4 cm   versus @xmath45 , the horizontal dashed lines , from bottom to top , denote @xmath54 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ] -0.4 cm -0.2 cm",
    "why can we see such anomalous temperature dependent heat transport ? is there any new properties after including the st anharmonic interaction ? to answer these questions , we here first study the momentum spread and then explore the properties of phonons damping with the temperatures .",

    "as can be seen , the momentum spread also indicates interesting temperature dependent behavior : while at low temperatures there are some oscillations in the profiles of @xmath61 [ see fig .",
    "5(a ) ] ; with the increase of @xmath45 , such oscillations become less and less [ see fig .",
    "5(b ) ] , and eventually disappear [ see fig .",
    "5(c ) ] ; after that if one increases the temperature further , the front peaks begin to disperse [ see fig .",
    "thus this unusual change of @xmath61 with temperatures may correspond to the anomalous temperature dependence of heat spread .",
    "it was usually suggested that the velocity of the front peaks shown in the momentum spread just corresponds to the sound velocity @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "a recent theory  @xcite proposed a general formula @xmath63 which can predict the sound velocity for systems with any interparticle interaction . in formula",
    "( 6 ) , @xmath64 is the interparticle potential , @xmath65 denotes the covariance @xmath66 for any two quantities @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the averaged pressure ( @xmath70 for symmetric potentials ) .",
    "it is thus worthwhile to check whether formula ( 6 ) is still valid here . for such purpose",
    ", we numerically measure the velocity of front peaks as shown in @xmath61 for each temperature and compare the result with the prediction from formula ( 6 ) . to obtain the theoretical predictions , we insert the st anharmonic potential [ eq .",
    "( 2 ) ] into formula ( 6 ) and calculate the ensemble average of each quantity @xmath71 by @xmath72 .",
    "-.2 cm -0.4 cm   versus @xmath45 , where the dashed line denotes the predictions from formula ( 6).,title=\"fig : \" ] -0.4 cm -0.2 cm    figure 6 shows the result of @xmath62 versus @xmath45 .",
    "as can be seen , the numerical measurements match the predictions quite well , suggesting that indeed , the formula ( 6 ) can also be validated to the systems with st anharmonicity .",
    "more - importantly , both results indicate the decrease of sound velocity with temperatures , which is clearly opposite to the results as shown in the fpu-@xmath8 chain  @xcite .",
    "thus , this may be a general feature for systems with st anharmonicity .",
    "clearly , the decrease of sound velocity can not be used to fully understand the temperature dependence of heat spread .",
    "we thus turn to analyze how the phonon spectrum @xmath73 would depend on temperature , from which one may gain further useful information , since a quite recent work  @xcite suggested that both phonons damping and softening are crucial to the observed normal heat transport ( @xmath74 , satisfy the fourier s law ) .    the phonon spectra @xmath73 is calculated by applying a frequency @xmath75 analysis of the particles velocity @xmath76 @xmath77 to relate to the heat spread , this should be done at the corresponding equilibrium states under the same focused temperature . for facilitating the computation , here",
    "we choose a chain of @xmath78 particles , then thermalize the chain to the focused temperature by langevin heat baths  @xcite , finally remove the heat baths and perform a frequency analysis of @xmath76 following eq .",
    "this should also be done by starting from properly assigned initial random states for several times .",

    "two key points can be revealed from the results .",
    "first , with the increase of temperature , phonons tend to become  softer \" since @xmath73 walks towards the direction of low frequency .",
    "this can be captured from the locations of the peaks in the high frequency parts ( see fig .",
    "to more clearly characterize this phonons softening process , one can measure the averaged frequency @xmath79 of phonons by defining @xmath80 . as complementary",
    "we plot @xmath79 versus @xmath45 in fig .",
    "9 , from which a monotonous decrease of @xmath79 different from the non - monotonous case as shown in  @xcite can be clearly seen .",
    "this seems to suggest that a monotonous phonons softening process is inadequate to induce a normal heat transport .",
    "-.2 cm -0.2 cm   of phonons shown in @xmath73 versus temperature.,title=\"fig : \" ] -0.4 cm -0.2",
    "cm    let us finally turn to the results of phonons damping .",
    "since if it is still called phonon , in its power spectrum at corresponding frequencies there should be some oscillations . with this in mind",
    "we then can employ fig . 8 to observe this phonons damping process . as can be seen , with the increase of temperature , the damping first originates from the high frequency parts",
    "[ see fig .",
    "8(a ) and ( b ) ] and then quickly towards the low ones [ see fig .",
    "8(c ) ] . however , this quick damping process can not last forever if one further increases the temperature [ see fig .",
    "8(d ) ] , eventually , a power spectrum of phonons very similar to that shown in fpu-@xmath8 systems with ht anharmonicity ( in the high nonlinearity regime )  @xcite can be seen .",
    "here we use the critical frequency of @xmath81 ( below which phonons are damped very weakly ) to characterize this phonons damping process .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that this incomplete damping process may correspond to the lvy walks densities observed in heat spread under high temperatures .",
    "it also suggests that both st and ht anharmonicity can only lead to an incomplete damping of phonons , thus generally a universal anomalous heat transport with certain scaling exponents could be seen in nonlinear systems with only st or ht anharmonicity .",
    "in summary , we have studied the temperature dependent heat transport behavior in a 1d system when the st interparticle interaction is considered .",
    "we have found that by increasing the temperature , including the st anharmonicity can induce some opposite effects to the counterpart systems with ht anharmonicity , such as that _ monotonously _ softening the phonons and decreasing the sound velocity",
    ". however , these unusual properties are still inadequate to lead to a normal heat transport .",
    "a analysis of phonons spectra indicates an incomplete damping of phonons , especially those at low frequencies .",
    "this property of spectra is similar to that shown in the fpu-@xmath8 system with ht anharmonicity .",
    "our results thus suggest that both st and ht anharmonicity will eventually lead to a general super - diffusive heat transport behavior , therefore further supporting the conjecture that nonlinearity / chaos is , neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for the validity of fourier s law .",
