    "a natural standpoint about quantum mechanics , which is however not the one usually considered in textbooks written for physics students , is to look at it as a new probability theory , different and reacher than the classical one @xcite .",
    "this point of view becomes mandatory or at least very fruitful if one is faced with more advanced research topics , such as the description of open quantum systems or quantum information and communication theory ( for a general reference see @xcite ) . in these fields tools and concepts obtained relying on a probabilistic approach , also working in direct analogy with classical probability theory ,",
    "have become of paramount importance .",
    "an example in this direction is given by quantum dynamical semigroups , which provide the quantum generalization of classical markov semigroups .",
    "the subject has been the object of active research in the mathematics , physics and chemistry community over decades by now , but it is still of great interest . in particular covariance properties of such mappings under translations have been considered in detail only recently . besides a mathematical characterization @xcite also the actual physical relevance @xcite of such covariant quantum dynamical semigroups has been considered .    in the present contribution we will focus mainly on the application of such translation - covariant quantum dynamical semigroups to the study and the description of the phenomenon called decoherence in the physics literature @xcite . by such a term a whole variety of situations",
    "is meant , all having in common a loss of typical quantum interference capability , arising as a dynamical consequence of interaction of the system of interest with some other , typically much bigger , system .",
    "the phenomenology of decoherence is ubiquitous when considering open quantum systems , but its actual quantitative study requires very special experimental conditions , which can be realized e.g. in interferometric setups for massive particles , observing loss of interference fringes as a consequence of external disturbance , arising because the approximation of isolation of the system is no more realistic . for a quantitative study of the phenomenon it is in fact crucial that such decoherence effects can actually be engineered , so that their strength is under the control of the experimenter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : tv ] we briefly sketch the formal expression of the generator of a translation - covariant quantum dynamical semigroup . in sect .",
    "[ sec : lp ] we show how such a general structure in a suitable limit can account for decoherence behaviors quantitatively described by means of the characteristic function of a classical lvy process . in sect .",
    "[ sec : mp ] we further explore how a particular physical example of realization of such generators applies to the description of decoherence in both position and momentum space , finally mentioning possible extension of the formalism in sect .",

    "provided memory effects can be neglected , quantum dynamical semigroups @xcite give a general setting for the description of the dynamics of an open quantum system @xcite . in the physical literature",
    "major efforts have been devoted to the derivation or phenomenological assessment of possible generators of such quantum dynamical semigroups , so called master equations .",
    "the typical benchmark is the lindblad structure of such generators , which goes back to the work of gorini , kossakowski and sudarshan @xcite and of lindblad @xcite , holding true for a generator given by a bounded mapping .",
    "attention was later devoted to possible constraints on the structure of such generators arising as a consequence of symmetry ( see e.g. @xcite for references ) . in this respect",
    "the results of holevo for symmetry under translations are of particular importance because of the many possible physical applications , especially in connection with typical quantum phenomena such as decoherence .",
    "we first consider the general expression of formal generators of translation - covariant quantum dynamical semigroups as obtained by holevo @xcite .",

    "these different lvy processes intuitively correspond to the different ways according to which momentum is transferred to the test particle as a consequence of interaction with the environment .",
    "thus for example a poisson process corresponds to a situation in which the different possible interaction events are characterized by a fixed momentum transfer , given by the height of the jumps in the poisson process .",
    "more generally a physically realistic situation involves a compound poisson process , characterized by the fact that the momentum transfer in the single interaction events is not a deterministic quantity , but it is itself described by a probability density , depending on the detail of the microscopic interaction mechanism , according to which the poisson process is composed .",

    "furthermore for a fixed spatial distance @xmath21 the off - diagonal matrix elements in the position representation are fully suppressed for long enough interaction times , while for a fixed interaction time these off - diagonal matrix elements only go to zero if the associated process admits a proper probability density , which is not the case e.g. for a compound poisson process . depending on the particular process describing the random momentum transfers in each scattering event different characteristic functions appear , corresponding to different behaviors in the suppression of the off - diagonal matrix elements for large spatial separations .",
    "the function @xmath32 , which is responsible for the loss of visibility in interferometric experiments testing decoherence , for a fixed interaction time @xmath33 might monotonically decrease to zero for growing values of @xmath21 , or also oscillate and reach asymptotically a finite value corresponding to a residual coherence .",
    "these quite different behaviors , corresponding to a more or less effective decoherence effect , are all encoded in the possible expressions of the characteristic function @xmath34 .",
    "application of this formalism to actually realized experiments has been considered in @xcite .",

    "the general structure of translation - covariant quantum dynamical semigroups allows for the description of decoherence effects provided one considers the behavior in time of the so called coherences , that is to say the off - diagonal matrix elements of the statistical operator in a given basis , selected by the dynamics itself or by the observation which can be performed on the open system . for the considered massive particle interacting with some environment the natural basis",
