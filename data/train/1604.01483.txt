    "if present in a steady nonchaotic flow , coherent blobs of two miscible fluids separated by a streamline will tend to mix together via the typically inefficient mechanism of diffusion .",
    "this is a common situation in microfluidics , in which a sample and a reagent are to be mixed in order to achieve a biochemical reaction in , say , a dna synthesis experiment , and in which low reynolds numbers are inevitable due to spatial dimensions and typical velocity scales . accelerating the mixing",
    "can be achieved by introducing unsteady velocity agitations to impart advective transport across the flow interface .",
    "if this process results in fluid filamentation across / near the interface , it will enhance diffusive mixing in addition to causing advective intermingling between the two fluids .",
    "understanding this process , and being able to quantify resulting fluid mixing , is important in flows ranging from geophysical to microfluidic , for example in assessing how an introduced pollutant blob mixes with exterior fluid in the ocean , or how a sample and a reagent can be mixed together effectively in micro- or nano - level bioreactors .",
    "the role of lagrangian ` unsteady flow barriers ' in separating regions of fluid which move coherently is now well - established @xcite .",
    "ideas for these arose from the concepts of stable and unstable manifolds for stagnation points in steady flows , which in many models can be shown to explicitly demarcate regions which have different lagrangian flow characteristics ( see fig .  1 in each of @xcite , for steady examples ; these arguments have been shown to work in unsteady flows as well @xcite . ) .",
    "thus , for example , the outer boundary of an oceanic eddy in such a model would contain one or more stagnation points , each of whose stable manifolds connects up as the unstable manifold of another ( or the same ) stagnation point .",
    "this is necessary to ensure a different flow topology inside the eddy / vortex from the outside .",
    "when a stable manifold coincides with an unstable manifold it is called a _ heteroclinic manifold _ @xcite .",
    "these entities satisfy a variety of other interesting characteristics , including ( i ) being associated with curves / surfaces of maximal attraction or repulsion , ( ii ) blobs on them eventually expanding exponentially in some directions while contracting exponentially in complementary directions , and ( iii ) being transport barriers in the sense that the fluid on the two sides remains ` almost ' coherent under the flow . by targetting exactly these characteristics in _",
    "unsteady _ flows defined only for _ finite _ times , obtained either from numerical solutions of governing equations or directly from experimental / observational velocity data , researchers from many fields attempt to determine _ unsteady flow barriers_. for the three characteristics mentioned , the relevant methods are respectively ( i ) hyperbolic lagrangian coherent structures @xcite , ( ii ) finite - time lyapunov exponent ridges @xcite , and ( iii ) eigenvectors associated with the perron - frobenius ( transfer ) operator @xcite .",
    "( it must be noted that the term ` lagrangian coherent structures ' is often used for _ all _ these techniques , and many more , to highlight the fact that these are based on _ lagrangian _ evolution of particles ; the idea is to determine entities which separate fluid blobs which move in some coherent fashion in a velocity field . ) direct stable / unstable manifold definitions for unsteady flows can also be used by appropriately extending to infinite times @xcite .",
    "these methods _ all _ identify the flow barriers purely by examining the velocity field , i.e. , they determine curves / surfaces arising from analysis of the lagrangian flow equation @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the ( potentially unsteady ) velocity field , known either explicitly or from discrete data .",
    "this rich suite of methods continues to grow @xcite , and improvements to existing methods continue to be reported @xcite .",
    "however , given that these are all based directly on the velocity , _ they ignore actual flow interfaces between two fluids_. thus , they are generally inapplicable for two - phase flows of miscible fluids , as highlighted by simple examples in fig .",
    "[ fig:2fluids ] . in the upper panel ,",
    "two different fluids enter a microchannel from the left , each entering perhaps from syringes or tubes ( not pictured ) positioned on the upper and lower sides of the channel .",
    "since these fluids could for example be a sample and a reagent in a microfluidic bioreactor , there is no necessity for the two fluids to be needed in the same proportion .",
    "this results in the fluids flowing to the right in a laminar fashion , with their mutual fluid interface not along the centerline of the channel . attempting to identify the flow interface _ purely from the fluid velocity _",
    "is futile ; there is absolutely nothing distinguished about the streamline along the flow interface ( in magenta ) in comparison to other streamlines .",
    "it is not even the streamline of maximum speed , which ( if assuming the classical parabolic velocity profile ) is at the centerline .",
    "all methods describe above will therefore fail in this simple example .",
    "the flow interface is something _ physical _ , and not derivable from the velocity field .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:2fluids ] shows a situation in which an anomalous fluid ( a pollutant , nutrient , chemical , plume of higher temperature , etc ) has intruded into the center of a vortex .",
    "the flow interface between the interior and exterior fluids here is a streamline , but once again there is nothing distinguished about this streamline based on the velocity field .",
    "there are closed streamlines both inside and outside this particular interface which distinguishes between the inside and outside fluids .",
    "it is such flow interfaces between miscible fluids , and determining transport across them under the introduction of velocity agitations , that is the focus of this article .     +    all methods based purely on the velocity field ( such as finite - time lyapunov exponents , curves of extremal attraction , transfer operators , or stable / unstable manifolds ) fail in identifying this physical flow interface , even in these simple steady examples .",
    "if attempting to determine transport between the fluids , one numerical method which _ would _ work is to think of evolving the fluid density of each of the fluids according to an advection - diffusion ( convection - diffusion ) equation @xcite or other relevant dynamics @xcite . rather than limiting attention to the fluid velocity and resulting lagrangian trajectories , the trick would be to consider the two evolving fluid density fields .",
    "one might define the flow interface as a front of one of these density fields , and under the operation of advection and diffusion ( assuming that there is a known way to parametrize the pclet number which characterizes the strength of the diffusion ) , one might be able to _ computationally _ make progress on this issue .",
    "however , this will not help in obtaining a broader conceptual understanding of the process .",
    "how does the fluid interface evolve ? is it possible to characterize how ` complicated ' it gets ? how can the interchange of fluid be quantified ?",
    "is there an optimal velocity agitation to maximize cross - interface transport ? having a theory would give the ability to analyze questions such as these , with the longer term goal of being able to maximize or limit transport @xcite according to our wishes .",
    "studying interfaces between two miscible fluids is not new , and includes much recent work @xcite .",
    "the approach followed here , in which the lagrangian particle evolution is directly used in conjunction with techniques inspired by dynamical systems theory , is however a novel approach , which moreover provides tools for answering the questions posed above .",
    "the key to proceeding is in determining how one might identify the flow interface under unsteady velocity agitations .",
    "it will be argued that the concept of a _ streakline _ is the most appropriate to use , under the condition that the velocity agitation is confined to a certain region .",
    "( the streaklines used here are _ not _ associated with stable / unstable manifolds , as might be the case if considering the interface between a fluid and a bluff body @xcite . ) briefly , this is because if the agitation is confined to being downstream of @xmath2 in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:2fluids ] , then the streakline passing through @xmath2 will demarcate the boundary between the two fluids , as fluids arriving from upstream on the two sides of @xmath2 are different .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : streaklines ] will develop the theory for the streaklines  the ` nominal ' flow interfaces when the weak velocity agitations are considered  and their evolution with time .",
    "explicit analytical expressions are obtained by utilizing dynamical systems methods , and are valid for general time - dependence in the velocity agitation , and also allow for compressibility in the fluid .",
    "section  [ sec : streakexamples ] provides a validation of these expressions in comparison to numerical simulations of streaklines , in two examples which are loosely based on fig .",
    "[ fig:2fluids ] .",
    "specifically , the first example considers the impact on the flow interface as a result of introducing flow in cross - channels ( a so - called _ cross - channel micromixer _",
    "@xcite ) , while the second concerns the impact on the ` boundary ' of kirchhoff s elliptic vortex @xcite due to weak external strain . in section  [ sec :",
    "transport ] , a theory for quantifying the transport between the two fluids as a result of the agitation is developed .",
    "of particular interest here is the question of ` transport across what ? '",
    "since when the flow is unsteady , there is ambiguity in defining the fluid interface .",
    "if the interface is thought of in terms of a timeline ( i.e. , particles seeded on the interface , and evolved with time ) , since the timeline is a material surface , there can be no transport across it .",
    "therefore , an appropriate way of defining a ` nominal ' flow barrier , which respects the streakline ideas , needs to be formulated . an explicit approximation for the transport between the two fluids",
    "is obtained ; this shall be useful in future work in , for example , determining forms of velocity agitations which maximize transport ( as in the similar developments for heteroclinic situations @xcite ) .",
    "the theory is once again validated by numerical simulations of the same two examples in section  [ sec : transportexamples ] .",
    "the second of these offers a novel way of examining the oft - studied problem of vortices in an external straining field @xcite ; here , the lagrangian fluid interchange between the interior and exterior fluids caused by weak external strain is quantified .",
    "finally , directions of future work are outlined in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "consider a steady two - dimensional flow in which there is a persistent ( one - dimensional ) flow interface between two different miscible fluids .",
    "the _ persistence _ of this entity is annoying from the perspective of mixing the two fluids together , and hence the goal is to understand how an _ unsteady _ velocity agitation affects this flow interface , and how the resulting advective transport between the fluids can be quantified .",
    "firstly , to introduce notation , consider the steady flow @xmath3 incompressibility is _ not _ assumed for the fluids , but @xmath4 is assumed to be smooth .",
    "now , a flow interface @xmath5 that persists in the steady flow ( [ eq : steady ] ) must have no fluid velocity perpendicular to @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the velocity @xmath4 is tangential to @xmath5 , which can be characterized as part of a streamline of the initial steady flow . since the velocity is steady , this can be thought of as a streamline , streakline , or pathline , but as shall be seen shortly , when an unsteady velocity agitation is applied , thinking of the flow barrier as a _ streakline _ is the correct approach .",
    "let @xmath5 be such a streakline .",
    "a velocity agitation will be applied to the part of @xmath5 which lies between the points @xmath2 and @xmath6 only , and this restricted part of @xmath5 shall be denoted @xmath7 .",
    "thus , @xmath7 is a curve which starts at the upstream anchor point @xmath2 , and connects along the streamline emanating from @xmath2 and progressing to the downstream anchor point @xmath6 .",
    "two generic situations are possible : ( i ) @xmath8 , in which case @xmath7 is an open curve , and ( ii ) @xmath9 , in which case @xmath7 is a closed curve .",
    "these two situations are exactly analogous to those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2fluids ] ; however , there is no necessity for the streaklines to be as uniform as those pictured here .",
    "the streakline @xmath5 is the extension of @xmath7 along the streaklines passing through @xmath2 and @xmath6 ; it is clear that in the open case @xmath5 extends beyond @xmath10 . in the closed case ,",
    "the streakline @xmath5 can be thought of as retracing the closed loop @xmath7 repeatedly , as will happen if dyed particles are continually ejected at @xmath9 .",
    "there are two assumptions on the flow interface .",
    "the first is that @xmath7 be a _",
    "( non self - intersecting ) curve .",
    "the second  which is crucial  is that @xmath11 on @xmath5 . if @xmath12 at some points on @xmath5 , then @xmath5 will consist of parts of heteroclinic manifolds , and established theory for locating these @xcite , and the resulting transport time - periodic @xcite , aperiodic @xcite or impulsive @xcite situations , applies",
    ". moreover , standard diagnostic tools such as finite - time lyapunov exponents or curves of maximal attraction are viable candidates for numerically determining the flow barriers .",
    "therefore , stagnation points will be explicitly precluded on @xmath5 ; it shall be _ non - heteroclinic_.     +    the streakline @xmath5 is easily defined as a curve in @xmath13 , via a parametrization @xmath14 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] . here",

    "if @xmath7 is closed , then the velocity agitation will occur throughout @xmath5 ( the periodic repetition of @xmath7 , except at the anchor point @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , @xmath14 is a periodic function of @xmath15 in this instance , but the restriction to @xmath7 acheived by setting @xmath20 $ ] implies that @xmath21 but that @xmath22 is the next instance in which @xmath14 reaches @xmath2 , which is of course @xmath6 . in either the open or closed situation , of interest",

    "similarly , @xmath6 would be an anchor point on the interface in backward time .",

    "the flow on @xmath7 is not of a constant speed , @xmath7 is curved , and the velocity agitation is not always perpendicular to @xmath7 .",
    "determining the pseudo - streakline at a general time @xmath25 will therefore be more complicated .",
    "take @xmath116 as before , and let @xmath6 be the identical point but after the vortical flow has taken the particle released from @xmath2 one round around the vortex .",

    "the time one needs to start releasing particles is therefore only implicitly defined , which lends some difficulty in the computation .",

    "the downstream streakline can be obtained , and the gate drawn in between these .",

    "the effect of diffusion is not explicit in the theory here , which focusses specifically on the advective ( lagrangian ) flow .",

    "a minor point which must be made is the connection to imcompressibility , which is satisfied for the velocity conditions chosen in this example .",
    "does the fact that there is a flux exiting the vortex for all time contradict incompressibility ?",
    "the answer is no , since the closed pseodo - streakline  the purported flow interface under the unsteady conditions  compensates for the expelled fluid by becoming smaller .",

    "[ fig : evpseudostreakline ] ; these get smaller as @xmath25 increases .",
    "indeed , the rate of change of the area enclosed by the pseudo - streakline is _ precisely _ the definition of the instantaneous flux , when @xmath7 is closed .",
    "the concepts of stable and unstable manifolds  and various finite - time analogues such as finite - time lyapunov exponent ridges @xcite , curves of extremal attraction / repulsion @xcite , partitions based on perron - frobenius operators @xcite , time - clipped manifolds @xcite , fronts associated with averaged flow quantities @xcite and other lagrangian coherent structure type approaches @xcite  are important in demarcating flow barriers in _ single phase _ unsteady flows . here",
    ", the focus is on _ two - phase _ flows , in which such entities derived purely by examining the velocity field do not distinguish the flow barrier . in the steady , as - yet - unmixed situation , the flow barrier is the _ interface _ between the two fluids , which is identified physically as opposed to from characteristics of the fluid velocity .",
    "this article has focussed on determining the flow interface , and the transport across it , when an unsteady velocity agitation is introduced .",
    "the relevance of streaklines has been highlighted , and their usage in defining a nominal interface ( a _ pseudo - streakline _ ) , and quantifying an instantaneous transport across this has been elucidated . under the condition that the velocity agitation is weak ( i.e. , has speeds significantly smaller than that of the base steady velocities ) , a theory for determining the streaklines , and the transport flux , has been developed .",
    "validations of the method in comparison to numerically computed streaklines was performed for the open ( two fluids flowing along a channel ) and closed ( a blob of one fluid inside a vortex ) flow interfaces situations .",
    "the method for quantifying the transport across the flow interface developed in this paper depends on the velocity agitation being small in comparison to the base flow , which is steady .",
    "however , the method does _ not _ require incompressibility , or a particular form of time - dependence , and is thus fairly general .",
    "indeed , it is likely that recent work @xcite which characterizes the effect of an _ impulsive _ velocity ( such as obtained by tapping a fluidic device , say ) on stable / unstable manifolds , can be modified to determine the streaklines and transport associated with a non - heteroclinic flow interface , consonant for example with the impulsively strained vortex numerics of @xcite .",
    "the presence of a theoretical approximation for the transport offers scope in being able to _ optimize _ it .",
    "such has been done in the case where the flow barrier was a heteroclinic manifold ( coincident stable and unstable manifold ) in the situation where a sinusoidally varying velocity agitation was applied @xcite . given that the transport expression ( [ eq : melnikov ] ) obtained in this non - heteroclinic instance shares some similarities with the heteroclinic theory of @xcite , there is obvious scope in being able to adapt those ideas to this situation .",
    "since there are also analytical expressions ( [ eq : upstream ] ) and ( [ eq : downstream ] ) for the streaklines , another possibility is being able to quantify how complicated these entities get due to advection , as a measure of eventual diffusive transport .",
    "there is considerable evidence of the presence of an optimal frequency of a velocity agitation in order to maximize mixing @xcite ; would it be possible to determine this in , for example , configurations such as that of the channel examined here ?",
    "alternatively , can one obtain insight into the best positioning of cross - channels to effect the best mixing across the flow interface ?",
    "questions such as these are under investigation , and will be reported on in follow - up work .",
    "it is interesting that streaklines have _ also _ been suggested as having importance in evaluating transport , independently by karrasch in a recently accepted article @xcite discovered by the author just before initial submission of the present paper .",
    "the differential topology and donating region viewpoints of that article @xcite do not have an obvious connection to the present paper , which focusses on fluid interchange between two miscible fluids across their interface .",
    "nevertheless , further investigation of a possible relationship will be pursued .",
    "the approach presented here offers a different viewpoint on the oft - examined vortex - in - an - external - strain problem @xcite , in the sense that it permits a direct computation of the fluid flux into , or out of , the vortex as a function of time , for a given weak external strain field . in this sense",
    ", it captures lagrangian transport , as opposed to standard methods which , for example , picture the time evolution of the frozen - time ( eulerian ) vorticity field @xcite .",
    "there are of course connections between the lagrangian and eulerian viewpoints , but in cases where the _ transport _ is important , the current approach may provide new insights .",
    "the closed flow interface situation appears to be of particular interest in modeling how a blob of fluid ( an oil / pollutant / nutrient / plankton / chemical patch ) which is placed in an anomalous fluid mixes in with its surroundings . once again , ` standard ' methods for detecting coherent structure boundaries directly from the velocity field are not necessarily applicable , since the flow interface is a physical boundary between two fluids as opposed to an entity derivable from the velocity field .",
    "the methods outlined in this article are a first step towards understanding the lagrangian transport associated with this from a theoretical perspective .",
    "the trick is trying to identifying the flow interface in the presence of an unsteady velocity , which can be done here if there is an anchor point on the interface at which the _ unsteady _ component of the velocity is zero .",
    "if not , there is a difficulty in deciding where to release particles for the streakline determination . how one might figure out the pseudo - streakline ( i.e. , the relevant unsteady flow interface ) when there is no such anchor point is not clear . note that the process of evolving particles on the closed steady flow interface ( i.e. , examining the _ timeline _ ) is not effective in assessing transport , since this closed loop simply remains a closed loop under unsteady velocity agitations , and therefore a transport between the interior and exterior _ across",
    "this _ is zero .",
    "this is of course true for any material curve , which precludes their usage for transport assessment . a nominal flow interface across which there is transport needs to be enunciated .",
    "the ability to do so using streaklines when there is at least one anchor point , as outlined here , can hopefully be build on , in the situation of weak strain which is never zero on the interface .",
    "the proof here is in the spirit of the proof of theorem  2.1 in @xcite , in which an unstable manifold s displacement is characterized .",
    "however , this situation is different , since it is the upstream streakline that is required .",

    "intuitively , this is because the particle from the steady streakline , _ and _ that from the unsteady streakline , share the property that they both emanated from the point @xmath2 .",
    "next , consider the upper limit @xmath217 . if @xmath7 is open , using table  [ table : p ] in the situation where @xmath218 ( i.e. , the streakline has not yet reached @xmath6 ) , then @xmath219 . inserting this will give @xmath211 , which according to ( [ eq : mfproject ] ) is the correct entity sought in the time - slice @xmath25 . if , however , the streakline is beyond @xmath6 , it no longer experiences a velocity agitation .",

    "if this is positive , it means that the upstream streakline is situated in a positive direction in comparison to the downstream one when considering the direction @xmath156 along @xmath235 .",
    "this enables the determination of whether the gate provides a channel for instantaneous flux from fluid @xmath152 to @xmath153 ( if positive ) , or from @xmath151 to @xmath154 ( if negative ) , as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : transport ] .",
    "second , the fluid velocity at all points on @xmath235 , in the normal direction , is to leading - order @xmath236 .",
