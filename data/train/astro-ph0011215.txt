    "the field of view is circular with a 24 diameter , which corresponds to 0.93 pc at an assumed distance of 8  kpc for the gc ( reid @xcite ) .",

    "the reference star for guiding was a @xmath10  =  14.5 star located 24 from .",
    "the data processing included the filtering of star halos and the assemblage of the individual images to build the total field , which contains the entire bear field .",
    "the fwhm of the point - spread function ( psf ) in the final image varies from 0.13 to 0.20 , depending on the distance to the guiding star .",
    "a slight elongation can be seen on the most distant images .",
    "nonetheless , the image quality is roughly 4 times better than the seeing - limited bear images .",
    "the processing of the bear data included two major operations .",
    "the first part is the standard processing for any bear data cube , from the raw data which are interferograms to the spectral cube .",
    "a second part has had to be developed specifically to cancel the atmospheric oh emission , extract the stars from a very crowded field , and to separate , in the spectra , the stellar contribution from the background emission .",
    "all these steps are briefly described below .",
    "the cube reduction , made with a package called _ bearprocess _ ( maillard @xcite ) , consists of the usual operations of flat - fielding of the images of the raw cube , sky subtraction , correction for bad pixels , and registration of each frame relative to the first one to correct for turbulent motions and flexure drifts .",
    "all the interferograms are extracted from this corrected cube , and the corresponding spectra are computed by fft , leading in this case to a 384-plane cube , this number being determined as the sum of powers of two , just larger than the initial 300 planes .",
    "the same operations have been made on the reference star data cube to yield in the end a single spectrum . from the division of the gc spectral cube by this reference spectrum ,",
    "a new cube was produced , corrected for the instrumental and atmospheric transmission . in order to fully reconstruct the line profiles , and to apply the instrumental phase correction through the field , an oversampled cube of 1153 frames",
    "was computed which contains only the useful part of the spectrum after division , between 4827.19 cm@xmath1 ( 2.0716  @xmath0 m ) and 4889.74 cm@xmath1 ( 2.0451  @xmath0 m ) . in this cube",
    ", the separation between frames corresponds to a mean velocity resolution of 3.35 km  s@xmath1 , i.e. , an oversampling by a factor of 12 from the initial cube .",
    "the cfht - fts is based on a design with dual input , dual output ( maillard & michel @xcite ) . for observations of isolated objects",
    "the source is centered in one entrance aperture , while the other one is open on the sky 53 west .",
    "this makes an automatic correction of the sky emission possible , in particular for oh . in the case of an extended field such as the gc , a single aperture must be open .",
    "therefore , the oh emission strongly contaminates the raw data cube .",
    "the problem is particularly serious since a strong oh line falls at 2.0563  @xmath0 m , within a typical linewidth of the stellar line .",
    "this oh line is not resolved and thus appears as an extended sinc function , the natural instrumental lineshape of an fts . in the useful part of the spectrum , a second oh line , four times fainter , at 2.0499  @xmath0 m , falls in the continuum .",
    "in addition , the oh line intensities do not appear to be perfectly uniform over the entire field .    we applied a method intended to allow the best removal of these lines , secondary maxima included .",
    "first , the spectrum of the atmospheric emission ( @xmath12 ) to be used as template was extracted by averaging the emission over about 100 pixels from small areas of the field devoid of sources .",
    "then , for each pixel spectrum @xmath13 of the data cube , the following expression was generated , integrated in the wavenumber @xmath14 over the full spectral range  : @xmath15 the final corrected spectrum is @xmath16 where @xmath17 corresponds to the value of @xmath0 for which @xmath18 is minimum .",
    "a new cube cleaned of oh emission was created according to this procedure , to which all the subsequent operations were applied .",
    "an image of the field of view was generated by co - adding most of the frames of this cube , with the exception of about 100 frames at each extremity , where division by the reference spectrum creates excessive noise .",
    "an automatic 2-d local maximum search was run on this image in order to detect the stars . with this procedure",
    "a total of 90 individual stars was identified within the circular field of the instrument . by using the photometry of ott et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for the faintest stars which are in common we determined a limiting magnitude of @xmath19 13 for the stellar flux integrated in a 3@xmath43 pixels aperture ( or @xmath2  1@xmath41 ) . for almost the same field as us ( a square field of 20@xmath420 centered on sgra@xmath20 ) 218 stars brighter than @xmath10 = 13 are reported by ott et al .",
    "( 1999 ) from deconvolved images integrated over a 0.25 diameter aperture .",
    "obviously , the main limitation comes from the seeing - limited imagery with bear in a very crowded field .    a facility program called _ cubeview _ ( maillard @xcite ) , specially developed to inspect any bear data cube , was used to extract the 90 stellar spectra from the cube , by integration over a 3@xmath43 pixels aperture , centered on the brightest pixel of each detected star image .",
    "the final spectra resulted from a smoothing operation ( boxcar function ) to improve the s / n ratio .",
    "this operation was justified since the spectral resolution was much narrower than the broad stellar line profiles ( 74 km  s@xmath1 against @xmath3 1000 km  s@xmath1 ) . to search all spectra for the presence of the 2.058  @xmath0 m line in emission ,",
    "a 3@xmath14-detection criterion was applied to each smoothed spectrum , with the noise estimated in the continuum . from the same cube",
    "a line cube was generated .",
    "this was done by estimating a linear continuum in each spectrum , extracted pixel - by - pixel over the entire field , and by subtracting it from the original spectrum .",
    "thus , the helium emission was all that remained . using _",
    "cubeview _ to inspect the cube images within the helium emission range revealed the stars being source of a emission as bright spots .",
    "note that with spectro - imaging data the equivalent of an ideal square filter can be applied , isolating only the emission component without continuum , thus giving the maximum contrast to these stars , more accurately than could be done by imaging through a narrow - band filter .",
    "a few other stars with helium emission , for which the automatic detection had failed , were found by this method . finally , the spectra of all the stars with helium emission were extracted from both cubes , in order to obtain two spectra for each star  : the total spectrum , and the spectrum of the emission line only .",
    "a co - added image was created with _ cubeview _ from all the frames of the line cube containing some emission .",
    "the resulting image clearly shows that the emission is concentrated in bright points , likely stars , but also in diffuse zones , indicative of interstellar gas lanes .",
    "therefore , a separation of stars and gas must be conducted to obtain pure stellar line profiles and a spectral cube of the interstellar medium ( ism ) emission only .",
    "the line profiles detected with _ cubeview _ from the line cube in the gas patches exhibit a width just equal to the spectral resolution , which contrasts with the much broader profiles on most stellar points .",
    "the increase in spectral resolution provided by the bear spectrometer appears essential for distinguishing the ism emission from the stellar emission . in many of the stellar profiles a narrow component",
    "is seen to be superimposed on a broad component . in these cases",
    "an inspection of the data in the vicinity of the star confirms the presence of extended ism emission along the line of sight .",
    "hence , the stellar profile can be cleaned of the ism emission contribution by a local interpolation on the profile . in other cases , a line with width equal to",
    "the spectral resolution appears on top of a stellar continuum .",
    "this typical linewidth avoids confusion with an emission of stellar origin .",
    "however , in a few cases the emission line on top of a stellar continuum appears relatively narrow , about twice as wide as a typical ism line . only the absence of ism emission in the neighborhood of such a star gives confidence in the stellar nature of the emission .",
    "the ism emission can also mimic a stellar profile .",
    "indeed , inspection of the cube indicates that , in some locations , the ism emission shows several velocity components , which can merge into a broader line . in these cases",
    "a global inspection of the images confirms that the profile is due to ism emission only . finally , after all this careful selection",
    ", a fit to the stellar emission at all the confirmed star positions in the line cube was subtracted from the spectra , generating a spectral cube of the ism emission .      in the end , 16 stars from the 90 stars isolated in the @xmath3 1-pc field centered on sgra@xmath20 exhibit the 2.058  @xmath0 m line in emission , which can be attributed only to the underlying star .",
    "a homogeneous set of fully resolved line profiles is obtained .",
    "this signature justifies them being called helium stars . actually , this designation is not a true stellar classification .",
    "they are simply stars showing the 2.058  @xmath0 m helium line in emission . in the following the term helium star or star",
    "will therefore be adopted in this context . from the stellar positions ,",
    "the correlation with previously identified stars was made from photometric surveys , e.g. , blum et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , eckart & genzel ( @xcite ) , and ott et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "three new helium stars not present in prior lists were first noted  : , and .",
    "one of them , , coincides with , a source already identified in the photometric survey of ott et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . this identification was adopted .    in order to derive the radial velocities of all these stars ,",
    "simple analytical models were used which take into account the profile evident in most profiles .",
    "the 2.058  @xmath0 m line has the advantage of not being blended with the emission lines of other atomic species which are likely to be present in the spectrum of these stars ( najarro et al .",
    "depending on the profile shape , we used three types of fitting models ( a , b , c ) . in each case , the model yields the fwhm of the emission component , and the velocity domain of the full profile , fwzi ( full width at zero intensity ) .",
    "the center of fwzi defines the radial velocity ( @xmath21 ) of the star .",
    "fwzi is also indicative of the terminal outflow velocity of the expanding envelope .",
    "* for the few profiles with no detectable absorption component , a fitting by a gaussian profile was used . in this case",
    "the fwzi is in fact estimated at one hundredth of the maximum intensity above the baseline .",
    "* for the profiles for which the absorption component has a width comparable to that of the emission component , a two - gaussian fitting was applied .",
    "fwzi is limited with the same criterion as above on the emission side , and at one hundredth of the central depth below the baseline on the absorption side .",
    "* for the stars with a profile but showing a very broad emission component , a two - component fitting was used with a profile described in morris ( @xcite ) for the emission component , and a gaussian profile for the absorption component . for the determination of fwzi , the boundary of the profile on the red side is given by the emission fit .",
    "the gaussian profile is limited as above on the absorption side .      for flux calibration",
    ", the stellar spectra must be extracted from the cube which includes the continuum . however , the intensity in these spectra is contaminated by the nearby stars present in the 3@xmath43 pixel bear box centered on each helium star .",
    "corrections of this contamination were applied with the help of the ao image . in order to do this ,",
    "the star positions and the peak intensities in the ao image were all determined with an automatic procedure .",
    "then , at each star position , the bear psf was placed , which is a lorentzian profile obtained from the calibration star data cube with the corresponding intensity .",
    "the result is an image at the bear spatial resolution .",
    "this reconstructed image was superimposed upon the image obtained by co - adding the frames of the bear cube with only the stellar continuum , by looking for the best match of the star patterns between the two images . by this process",
    "we determined the appropriate offsets and rotation between the two images . with these registration parameters ,",
    "the bear box for each star , centered on the bright pixel determined from the line cube was projected on the corresponding area of the original ao image . from this superposition , in the case of multiple images , the most likely identification of the helium star",
    "can be asserted , and then the contamination by the neighboring stars within the square aperture estimated .",
    "the absolute star positions could be measured at the precision of the pixel size in the ao image ( 0.035@xmath7/pixel ) .",

    "however , the two different classes of line profile associated with the remarkable anti - correlation with the continuum brightness call for two different types of hot , helium - rich stars . and are typical examples of each class . the differences can not be ascribed to orientation , such as an equatorial gaseous envelope seen edge - on or pole - on , as has been proposed to explain the two different types of emission line profiles in be stars . over the set of sources a continuity in the linewidths would be observed , with a double peak in some cases , while a single line is always observed , but with two radically different linewidths . these profiles are clearly suggestive in all cases of strong wind outflows .",
    "to which stellar types do these different profiles belong ?",
    "do they correspond to massive , hot stars but at two different stages of evolution ?",
    "the question of the stellar type of the stars has already been examined by all the authors who have previously studied this stellar population .",
    "note that they all make the preliminary remark that the study of the early - type gc stars forces a revision of the usual stellar classification criteria , generally based on visible spectra , to find their translation in the near infrared .",
    "this has triggered various spectroscopic studies of hot stars conducted in the k band , by hanson & conti ( @xcite ) , blum et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , tamblyn et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , morris et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , hanson et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , and figer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that the hot stars which exhibit the 2.058  @xmath0 m line in emission belong to a large variety of spectral types , from normal oe , be stars and b supergiants ( hanson et al .",
    "@xcite ) to sub - types of peculiar , luminous stars which are the b[e ] , lbv ( luminous blue variables ) , wr stars , and intermediate types like on , ofpe , ofpe / wn9 , undergoing a strong mass loss .",
    "discussion of these various stellar types are included in libonate et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and in tamblyn et al .",
    "( @xcite ) who discuss the helium stars in the gc .",
    "tracks of evolution of massive stars , depending on the initial mass and the metallicity , have been proposed by meynet et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "a typical sequence for massive stars , for example of 60 m@xmath6 , is  : o , blue supergiant , lbv and wr , as they evolve to becoming sns .",
    "the wr stars represent the final stage of evolution of massive o stars of initial mass @xmath25 40 m@xmath6 .",
    "two main sub - classes , the wn and the wc stars , depend on their phase of nucleosynthesis , the wc stars being the most evolved of the wr stars ( abbott & conti @xcite ) .    the k - band atlas of figer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) is devoted to the wr stars .",
    "these authors conclude that from this spectral range it is not easy to distinguish between individual sub - types , in particular for wc stars since their k spectra tend to be quite similar .",
    "regarding the 2.058  @xmath0 m line , they show that this line is present in late wn - types and otherwise , is particularly prominent in wc9 types .",
    "that is partially confirmed by tamblyn et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , who also mention a strong 2.058  @xmath0 m line with a profile for the wn8 and the lbv members of their star sample .",
    "they also note the line in simple emission , for the few late on - type and early b - type supergiants they observe .",
    "hanson et al .",
    "( @xcite ) detect the line in emission for oev et bev stars but with a complex profile , and otherwise in supergiant b1 stars .",
    "finally , it seems difficult to draw very clear conclusions since all these intermediate classes , such as lbv , on or ofpe , represent very rare groups of stars .",
    "for example , from a review of the statistics of lbvs and related stars by parker ( @xcite ) , there are only 5 confirmed lbv stars in the milky way disk , including the two famous examples itself and , and only 26 more within 8 nearby galaxies , including the and . however , parker notes that there are more candidates if more liberal definitions are applied , which means that it is not possible to generally assign a strict spectral type to these stars , in particular from a study carried out only within a limited spectral range .",
    "the wr stars are known for extremely broad emission lines ( abbott & conti @xcite ) , for which the values of @xmath3 1000  km  s@xmath1 and more are typical , comparable to the fwhm reported in fig .  [ figwr ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the line profile observed for in the lbv star is quite comparable to the 2.058  @xmath0 m line profiles we call narrow - line profiles ( fig .",
    "[ figpcyg ] ) .",
    "high resolution observations of the infrared emission lines of by najarro et al .",
    "( @xcite ) give lines with profiles having widths fitted by a model with a terminal velocity of 185 km  s@xmath1 and a @xmath26 of 18,100 k. the existence of an extended helium envelope for is given by the interferometric observations of vakili et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in the 6678   line .",
    "they estimate a photospheric radius r@xmath27 = 76 @xmath22 15  r@xmath6 and an extent of the helium envelope of 12.5 r@xmath27 .",
    "thus , from only the consideration of the two distinct types of line profiles , the helium stars with narrow - line profiles should be most closely related to lbv - type stars , while the other group to wr - type stars , without trying to be more specific .",
    "tamblyn et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , who had already noticed few stars in the inner pc with narrower line profiles , have considered whether these sources might be lbvs .",
    "they contest this hypothesis on the basis that lbv stars are a too brief phase of stellar evolution , which explains their rarity , and that these stars are not hot enough to be efficiently detected in the 2.058  @xmath0 m emission line .",
    "this conclusion is based on the observation of only two galactic lbv stars , of which effectively only one ( ) shows clearly the 2.058  @xmath0 m line in emission , whereas the other has a poor s / n ratio .",
    "thus , these arguments are not very convincing .",
    "one of the general parameters which distinguishes these two types of stars is their range of effective temperature ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "hence , a range of @xmath26 is reported from observations of lbvs ( crowther @xcite ) , from 8000  k to @xmath3 25,000  k , while for wrs the range is definitely beyond , from 30,000 to @xmath3 90,000  k ( van der hucht et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for all these stars ,",
    "the 2  @xmath0 m region is far from the maximum of emission .",
    "however , although hotter , the wr stars are intrinsically dim among massive stars , because of their relatively small photosphere radii .",
    "wc stars are typically 10@xmath28 l@xmath6 .",
    "these can be contrasted to lbv stars , which sit near the humphreys - davidson limit , typically above 10@xmath29 l@xmath6 .",
    "this fundamental difference is attributable to the copious mass loss experienced by the most massive o stars ( m @xmath2 120 m@xmath6 ) which will end their lives with a mass between 5 and 10 m@xmath6 , when they are wr stars .",
    "thus , this distinction between lbv and wr fits also with the observed difference in k magnitude between the two groups of stars ( point @xmath30 3 of the summary ) .",
    "the particular cases of and must be discussed within the framework of this classification .",
    "these two stars belong to the lbv - type group from their line profile , but with an @xmath10 typical of the other group ( table  [ mag ] ) .",
    "the few galactic lbvs studied in detail are known to be characterized by giant eruptions which are followed by dust obscuration . from the reconstructed light curve of ( humphreys et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the maximum obscuration lasted about @xmath3 40 years since the last eruption . from its pre - outburst level",
    "it had undergone a 4-mag visual extinction .",
    "these two lbv - type star candidates might be in such a phase .    in conclusion , we propose that the class of narrow - line stars consists of lbvs or related stars in the 10,000 to 20,000 k range of @xmath26 , while the second class consists of much hotter stars ( @xmath25 30,000  k ) , late - type wr stars , predominantly in the wc9 stage , according to the conclusions of figer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) from their k - band atlas of wr stars .",
    "the latter is also in agreement with the classification properly made for one helium star ( ) by blum et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "however , from these considerations only , the mere distinction between luminous blue stars and lbvs is not really possible . strictly speaking",
    ", variability should be established to identify an lbv .",
    "that is only suggested by the status of and compared to the other sources of the group . while wr stars seem the most likely for one group , only the proximity in evolution pleads in favor of lbv - related status for the other group , which is discussed in the next section , in relation to their spatial distribution ( point @xmath30 4 of the summary ) .",
    "is the above classification the result of a sequence of evolution , since lbvs are precursors of wr stars ?",
    "a parameter to take into account is the initial mass of the progenitors .",
    "an important conclusion of the evolutionary tracks of meynet et al .",
    "( @xcite ) is that , for the most massive stars - @xmath25 120 m@xmath6 - the lbv stage is avoided to go directly from o or of to late wn , then wc and sn . therefore , to be of the same age , the lbv - type stars must have originated from massive o stars in the range 40 to 120 m@xmath6 while the wr group should be originating from stars of initial mass @xmath25 120 m@xmath6 , which thus reached directly the wr stage where they are currently observed .",
    "the placing on fig .",
    "[ figdisp2 ] of the radial velocities as a function of the projected distance of the sources from sgra@xmath20 is another way of showing the two groups clearly distributed in two concentric volumes around sgra@xmath20 , with approximately equal velocity distribution .",
    "if we adhere to the coeval formation scenario , then the difference of spatial distribution of the two types of stars , presented in figs .",
    "[ figmap ] and [ figdisp2 ] , must be explained in this context , and we ask if that should be the signature of the star formation process .      figs .",
    "[ figmap ] and [ figdisp2 ] suggest that there are no orbits of wr stars in planes perpendicular to the plane of the sky , since we do not see any of them projected close to sgra@xmath20 . also , we measure radial velocities for these stars between @xmath31  300 km  s@xmath1 and @xmath32  600 km  s@xmath1 ( fig .  [ figdisp2 ] ) .",
    "so , the orbits can not be in the plane of the sky either , or all the @xmath21s would be close to 0 .",
    "thus , in agreement with genzel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , we can conclude that the orbits of these stars reside roughly in a disk inclined by 40@xmath9 off the plane of the sky , with quasi - circular orbits , which fits with their distribution in a ring of @xmath3 0.2 pc radial width , centered on sgra@xmath20 .",
    "the sign of the radial velocities ( fig .",
    "[ figdisp ] ) is consistent with the orbits described in a general clockwise sense , as derived from proper motions studies ( genzel et al .",
    "@xcite ) . however , these authors note that the fit of the best keplerian disk model to the star velocities is poor .",
    "the stars with narrow - line profiles are grouped in a cluster close to sgra@xmath20 .",
    "if circular orbits are also assumed for these stars the orbital radii must be small in order for them to appear as a cluster in projection .",
    "for the closest stars to sgra@xmath20 ( n2 , n3 and n4 in fig",
    ".  [ figdisp2 ] , within a radius of 0.06 pc ) the orbital velocity should be of the order of 600 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the largest measured radial velocity is 354 km  s@xmath1 for n3 , so pure keplerian motions are possible for these stars . with such velocities on a small orbital radius , a proper motion becomes detectable within a few years , as reported by ghez et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and genzel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "then , for star n2 ( ) for which a @xmath21 of only - 24 km  s@xmath1 is measured ( fig .  [ figdisp2 ] )",
    "the modulus of the projected proper motion velocity is 480 km  s@xmath1 from the measurements of genzel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . with the correction for projection",
    "an orbital velocity consistent with circularity is possible .",
    "at least , from the observations , very elongated orbits are excluded .",
    "the massive , hot stars are concentrated in the central pc around sgra@xmath20 . to remain concentrated in that position",
    "requires that their orbits are dominated by the gravitational field of the central black hole . from the conclusions of genzel",
    "( @xcite ) , the overall rotation of the cluster is a remnant of the original angular momentum pattern in the interstellar cloud from which these stars formed . indeed , they may have formed together in a gaseous disk orbiting the central black hole , less than @xmath3 5 myr ago from the life - time of wr stars .",
    "however , our observations imply that the stars differentiated according to their distance from the central black hole , into two star groups , distinguished by their initial mass , with more massive stars forming at a larger distance .",
    "this could be obtained , actually , if the initial disk was formed of two separate rings , one with a mean radius of @xmath3 0.04 pc , the other one of @xmath3 0.3 pc . if in addition , the sgra@xmath20 cluster ( genzel et al .",
    "@xcite , ghez et al .",
    "@xcite ) is considered , it continues the trend toward smaller masses located inward .",
    "these stars form a separate third group of main sequence , early - type stars ( genzel et al .",
    "@xcite ) . then",
    ", all these early - type stars may have formed in the same star formation event from a gaseous disk around the central mass , but with annular structures , probably caused by tidal forces , which remain to be explained .",
    "as very hot stars and with helium dominating their chemical composition , wr stars are sources of a strong ionizing flux ( schmutz et al .",
    "@xcite ) , thus implying the presence of a hard uv field in the inner pc .",
    "this is consistent with the presence of the helium mini - spiral ( fig .",
    "[ figstream ] ) we detect in emission in the near infrared , since hard ionizing photons are required to excite this line in the ism . however",
    ", this uv field can not penetrate very deep into the flows , because it will be blocked by the dust .",
    "therefore , the helium streamers should delineate the inner regions of the gaseous mini - spiral .",
    "that is likely the reason for which the helium emission map ( fig .",
    "[ figstream ] ) appears simpler than in br@xmath24 ( morris & maillard @xcite ) , and why the linewidth is relatively narrow ( @xmath33 70 km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "however , as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ stream ] , the same main emission structures are seen in and in br@xmath24 , as well as in ( lacy et al .",
    "the ism helium data cube indicates that the gas is distributed in several flows .",
    "but these gaseous orbits do not follow the early - type star distribution which has been described above .",
    "this implies that the overall kinematics of the gas and these stars are different .",
    "however , we noticed a similarity of radial velocity ( point @xmath30  5 of the summary ) between the stars and the streamers , along the same line of sight ( table  [ comparvr ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the kinematics of the streamers , within a radius of @xmath3 0.5 pc from sgra@xmath20 , become mainly dominated by the gravitational field of the central black hole . at further distances reached by the mini - spiral ,",
    "the field is more complex , with the contribution of all the other stars , which are essentially late - type stars . from the photometric survey of the central 5 parsecs of the galaxy by blum et al .",
    "( @xcite ) it can be estimated that @xmath3 80@xmath34 of the known stellar population is comprised of stars identified as late - type giants and supergiants ( e.g. ) by their co absorption ( blum et al .",
    "these k , m and agb stars which correspond to a mass range of 28 m@xmath6 ( except for the few supergiants ) are likely much older ( @xmath3 10@xmath35  3@xmath410@xmath36 yr ) than the current helium stars .",
    "they must have been produced in a totally different star formation event .",
    "they are stars with important mass loss , but not of helium - enriched material .",
    "hence , this suggests that the observed concentration of stars should be the major source of enhancement of the helium abundance in the inner gc . from the average mass loss rate reported for lbv and wr stars , and with the presence of around 20 of such stars , the total mass loss rate , only from all these stars in the central pc ,",
    "could be estimated at @xmath3 2@xmath410@xmath37 m@xmath6/yr .",
    "the dynamical time for the gas in the streamers of sgra west is about 10@xmath38 yr , so on this time scale , @xmath3  20  m@xmath6 of he - enriched stellar material might be mingling with the infalling matter in the streamers .",
    "the observed similarity of velocity , in amplitude and sign , of the stars and of the flows suggests a close link in the formation of both",
    ". the helium - rich mini - spiral might be the precursor of the disk in which will form the next , massive , hot star generation .",
    "new results on the population of stars in the inner region of the galactic center have been obtained with the firm indication of two classes of massive hot stars , which suggest a formation in a disk of gas around sgra@xmath20 .",
    "this analysis is based on a single line , the 2.058  @xmath0 m line . of course , while that is not sufficient to establish a complete spectral classification , one can nonetheless consider that this study represents a necessary initial selection test , since it has been shown that several stars in previous studies were wrongly considered as stars . by consequence",
    ", it illustrates also the risk of false detections in the search for emission - line stars toward the inner galaxy simply by using narrow - band photometry centered on the 2.058  @xmath0 m line , or other near - infrared emission lines .",
    "the importance of high spectral resolution combined with high spatial resolution is paramount for distinguishing stellar and interstellar emission .",
    "similar data obtained with bear already exists on br@xmath24 ( morris & maillard @xcite ) . with the same effort for separating the stellar and the interstellar component , the br@xmath24 line profile for the 16 confirmed stars should be retrieved , making another test on this stellar population .",
    "the next goal is a larger spectral coverage to complete the spectral criteria .",
    "that has already been done by several previous works , but always at medium resolution and with slit spectrometers , for which the source confusion is not easily controlled .",
    "only a slitless technique like that employed by bear makes this control possible .",
    "also , similar studies on other critical lines must be conducted .",
    "however , the next major step , instead of spectro - imaging at seeing - limited resolution as we have presented , and tried to improve by combining with ao imaging , will be infrared spectro - imaging at the diffraction - limited spatial resolution of a large telescope .",
    "that is the only way to detect more sources in order to remove all the identification ambiguities .",
    "as illustrated here , this should be combined with a spectral resolution of at least 5000 , which is not an easy goal .",
    "finally , it would be important to conduct similar studies in other stellar clusters like the arches and quintuplet clusters ( figer et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) where the identification of lbv stars has also been proposed , notably the pistol star ( figer et al .",
