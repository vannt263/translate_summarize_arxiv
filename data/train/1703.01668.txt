    "vlasov equation describes the behavior of a system of particles when the force felt by each particle is dominated by the mean - field created by all the others , while collisions are negligible .",
    "it plays of course a fondamental role in plasma physics and astrophysics , but also appears in many others fields , such as free electron lasers  @xcite , non linear optics  @xcite , sound propagation in bubbly fluids @xcite@xmath0 vlasov equation does not possess any mechanism driving the dynamics towards thermal equilibrium , as it neglects collisional effects , as well as noise and friction .",
    "this induces a range of unusual behaviors : among those , we will be particularly interested in the peculiar bifurcations close to a weakly unstable stationary state , see @xcite , and @xcite for a recent review .",
    "+ while the collisionless hypothesis may be a very good approximation for the time scale considered , some kind of relaxation mechanism is usually present , even if small . for plasmas @xcite and self gravitating systems @xcite",
    ", collisionnal effects provide this relaxation mechanism ; for cold atoms in a magneto - optical trap , there is a rather strong friction and velocity diffusion @xcite ; the dynamics of cold atoms in a cavity , although conservative in a first approximation , do contain friction and dissipation terms  @xcite .",
    "it is then natural to investigate the effect of a small relaxation mechanism on the specificities of the vlasov dynamics .",
    "this is not a new endeavor : indeed only a few years after the prediction of landau damping , lenard and bernstein have studied how a small velocity diffusion @xcite , modeled by a fokker - planck operator , would affect landau s linear analysis .",
    "their work has been since then complemented by many others : see @xcite in the context of plasma physics , or @xcite for more general potentials .",
    "these studies all deal with the linearized vlasov equation . in this paper , keeping the fokker - planck modeling for the relaxation mechanism , we address the question of the non linear dynamics close to a weakly unstable homogeneous stationary state .",
    "in particular we will investigate how the peculiarities of vlasov bifurcations survive a small fokker - planck dissipation .",
    "it was shown by j.d .",
    "crawford that unstable manifold expansions for vlasov equation are plagued by singularities @xcite when the real part of the unstable eigenvalue @xmath1 tends to @xmath2 . to be more specific , the dynamics on the unstable manifold reduces to the following equation , where @xmath3 is the amplitude of the unstable mode : @xmath4 it turns out that @xmath5 , sometimes called the `` landau coefficient '' , is negative and diverges as @xmath6 in the @xmath7 limit , the divergences of the subsequent terms in the series being even more severe .",
    "these `` crawford singularities '' should be regularized by the fokker - planck operator , and we will study what is their fate in the different regimes defined by the two small parameters , @xmath8 and the dissipation , which we will call @xmath9 . from now on ,",
    "we assume @xmath1 is real , and thus replace @xmath8 by @xmath1 .",
    "our results include the identification of the following three regimes , characterized by different behaviors of the landau coefficient : + i ) when @xmath10 , @xmath11 : the dissipation essentially has no effect .",
    "+ ii ) when @xmath12 , @xmath13 : the dissipation induces a qualitative change in the dynamics ; it provides a cut - off for the filamentation in velocity space . nevertheless , the non linear terms are still dominated by highly oscillating modes in velocity , as in the first regime .",
    "+ iii ) when @xmath14 , @xmath5 does not diverge .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that the higher non linear orders may still show some weak singularities .",
    "a new qualitative change occurs : the nonlinear terms are now dominated by slowly oscillating modes in velocity .",
    "+ the knowledge of @xmath5 , combined with , allows us to guess the scaling of the saturation amplitude , ie the amplitude of the perturbation reached over timescales of order @xmath15 .",
    "these results are crucial to analyze a bifurcation of vlasov equation in presence of a small dissipation , and are summarized on fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] .    a similar interplay between a bifurcation in a continuous hamiltonian system and a small dissipation has already been studied in the context of the weak instability of a 2d shear flow @xcite , described by euler equation plus a small viscosity .",
    "regimes i ) and ii ) are found in this context @xcite ; regime iii ) , as well as the boundary between regimes ii ) and iii ) , appear to be different , we will comment on this later .",
    "it is known ( see for instance @xcite , as well as for in @xcite in a fluid dynamics context ) that in the precise scaling regime @xmath16 , the viscosity enters the equations at the same order as the `` inviscid terms '' : this is compatible with @xcite and our results .",
    "in addition , while it is also known that the effective dynamics close to the bifurcation threshold in regime i ) is infinite dimensional , we conjecture that it is possible to define a finite dimensional reduced dynamics in regimes ii ) and iii ) .",
    "in other words , we expect that in regimes ii ) and iii ) can be safely truncated at cubic order when @xmath1 tends to @xmath2 , despite the nonlinear singularities of higher order coefficients .",
    "a precise investigation of this conjecture is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "although we will limit ourselves to the simplest possible setting , in 1d and with periodic boundary conditions , the computations needed to answer these questions are fairly involved . to carry them out , we will make use of the bargman representation of the heisenberg algebra ; this strategy appears to be new in this context .",
    "we obtain an intricate expression as a series for the landau coefficient @xmath5 ; we then analyze this series in the different scaling regimes , sometimes with the help of the mellin transform ; however , one part of this expression , which we expect to be negligible , has resisted our analysis . + the article is organize as follows : in section [ sec : setting ] we introduce more precisely the vlasov - newton fokker - planck equation and set the problem . in section [ sec : linear",
    "] , we solve the linearized vlasov - newton fokker - planck equation in bargman representation , providing the dispersion relation , eigenvectors and adjoint eigenvectors . this recovers already known results with a new method .",
    "we then turn to the case where the homogeneous stationary solution is weakly unstable , and provide a non linear unstable manifold expansion of the dynamics [ sec : nonlinear ] .",
    "this allows us to discuss the effect of the fokker - planck operator on the crawford s singularities , our main result .",
    "we conclude with several remarks and open questions .",
    "several technical parts are detailed in appendices .",
    "our starting point is the vlasov - newton - fokker - planck equation , which describes , through their phase - space density @xmath17 , particles interacting through newtonian interaction , and subjected to a friction and velocity diffusion . to keep the following computations as simple as possible ,",
    "we stick to one dimension . for later convenience",

    "the equation reads : @xmath19 we take @xmath20 , which corresponds to a newtonian ( attractive ) interaction , and @xmath21 to a coulombian ( repulsive ) one .",
    "we have chosen our units so that @xmath22 , hence @xmath23 is a stationary solution of this equation .",
    "it would be always stable for a repulsive interaction ; since we are interested in the weakly unstable case , we assume @xmath20 .",
    "our equation can be seen as a 1d self - gravitating model with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "similar models have received attention as toy models for cosmology @xcite , or to describe the dynamics of a cloud of trapped cold atoms @xcite . + we write @xmath24 and we will study @xmath25 , the perturbation .",

    "however , the regime iii ) @xmath261 is different , and the boundary between regimes ii ) and iii ) is different too .",
    "a possible explanation is that when the dissipative time scale is shorter than the linear instability time scale ( ie @xmath232 ) , it is necessary to add an external force to maintain the background shear flow .",
    "by contrast , maintaining the gaussian velocity distribution in the present vlasov - fokker - planck setting does not require any extra force , since it is stationary for the dissipation operator .",
    "the @xmath262 boundary already appeared in the literature on vlasov or 2d euler equations : in the derivation of the single wave model , taking @xmath16 is the right scaling to ensure that dissipation enters in the equation at the same order as the `` vlasov terms '' @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with our finding that for @xmath263 , the dissipation has no effect at leading order , while for @xmath264 it qualitatively modifies the problem . 5 .",

    ", we may conjecture that as soon as @xmath264 under a rescaling @xmath269 , the series can be safely truncated , yielding an effective ordinary differential equation for the reduced dynamics . while a full investigation of this conjecture is beyond the scope of this work , we present in [ sec : order5 ] a partial computation for the 5th order coefficient , which supports it . 7 .",
    "it is worth noting that the bifurcation of the standard kuramoto model @xcite , which shares some similarities with vlasov equation , do not present the same kind of divergences @xcite , and has been tackled at a rigorous mathematical level  @xcite .",
