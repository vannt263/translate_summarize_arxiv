    "only recently , glikman et al . ( 2010 , 2011 ) have given constraints on the faint end of the luminosity function in the optical band by using a sample of more than 40 faint ( m@xmath1222 ) quasars in the 3.74 to 5.06 redshift range .",
    "the presence of dust in high redshift sources ( jiang et al .",

    "2011 ; gilli et al .",
    "2011 ) . at the same time , x - ray surveys are limited in collecting large samples , either because wide area surveys have been not deep enough to detect @xmath84 agns or because deep surveys are too small and affected by cosmic variance . only two @xmath85 spectroscopically confirmed quasars have been x - ray selected so far , one in the cdfn ( z=5.19 , barger et al .",
    "2005 ) and the other in the clasxs survey ( z=5.4 , steffen et al .",

    "2009 ) mimics the exponential decline observed in the optical .",
    "however , the higher redshifts and lower luminosities regimes are still unexplored . the faint x - ray luminosity range ( @xmath910@xmath14  erg  s@xmath4 )",
    "is well sampled up to @xmath53 ( see e.g. , hasinger 2008 ) but not many sources have been detected at this luminosity at higher redshifts .",

    "for this reason , the main selection has been performed in the 0.5 - 2 kev band , closely corresponding to the 2 - 10 kev rest frame band at @xmath83 .",
    "in order to take into account for the presence of highly ( up to n@xmath19 @xmath18 ) obscured agns , we also considered the sources with detection only in the observed 2 - 10 or 0.5 - 10 kev bands .",

    "these curves show that moving the survey sensitivity diagonally in this plot is a better investment , for these purposes , than going sidey for either increased depth or area .",
    "doubling the coverage of the cosmos area and increasing the depth by a factor 2 ( dashed red thick line ) would substantially increase the @xmath83 low luminosity agn statistics by a factor 2 in the 10@xmath14 - 10@xmath59 erg  s@xmath4  range .",
    "this would be sufficient to resolve the controversial optical results in this luminosity range , based on small samples .",
    "a `` double - doubled '' survey of this kind would also increase the sample of z@xmath60 quasars ( dotted black line ) from 4 in the soft band to 7 - 8 sources at high luminosity .",
    "such a survey , performed with the same observational strategy of c - cosmos ( i.e. homogeneous exposure time and same tiling ) , would take approximately 6 ms with , the scale of the x - ray visionary projects . in this respect , the proposed wide field x - ray telescope ( wfxt )",
    "medium survey ( rosati et al . 2010 ) designed to cover a large area ( 3000 deg@xmath24 ) at the fluxes of the c - cosmos survey would be optimal to collect order of magnitude larger samples of high redshift agns compared to x - ray and also optical surveys now available ( brusa et al .",
