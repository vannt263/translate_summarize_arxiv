    "braneworld scenarios have attracted considerable attention in the literature during the last two decades because theses models can address some important issues in theoretical physics problems such as hierarchy @xcite and cosmological constant problem @xcite .",

    "this brane - world model is very ideal and its formation has no dynamical mechanism . but for realistic models thickness of brane should be considered . by",
    "now several thick brane construction mechanisms have been developed such as thick branes generated from pure gravity @xcite-@xcite , fermion self interaction branes @xcite and thick brane scenarios with the gravity coupled to five - dimensional scalar fields @xcite-@xcite . in the last scenario , the scalar field configuration is usually a kink .",
    "it is found that a single kink becomes unstable when it moves in a discrete lattice with a large velocity while multi - kink solutions remain stable @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is associated with interaction between kink and radiation , and the resonances were observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in cosmology we encounter models in which our universe is result of continuous collision of branes and nucleation and therefore splitting of branes is a fundamental scenario in these models @xcite-@xcite . + therefore",

    "such branes are constructed from a complex @xmath1 scalar field potential @xcite , or from a real @xmath2 scalar field potential @xcite .",
    "these branes can be constructed from deformation of @xmath1 scalar field potential as well.@xcite-@xcite .",

    "usually , in five dimension fermion do not have a normalizable zero mode without scalar - fermion coupling @xcite-@xcite . in five dimension , with a yukawa scalar - fermion coupling there may exist a massless bound state and a continuous gapless spectrum of massive kaluza - klein ( kk ) states @xcite , while in some of other brane models , there exist some discrete kk state and a continuous gapless mass spectrum starting from positive @xmath4 @xcite .",
