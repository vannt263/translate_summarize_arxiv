    "although there is also ample evidence for the existence of a nematic order , where a translationally invariant metallic phase spontaneously breaks rotational symmetry @xcite , and nematic quantum critical point ( qcp ) near optimal superconductivity in iron - based superconductors @xcite , much is unclear concerning its microscopic origin and relationship to superconductivity @xcite . in particular",
    ", recent debates focus on whether the nematic order in superconducting fese below the tetragonal - to - orthorhombic transition temperature @xmath1 k without static af order @xcite is due to competing magnetic instabilities or to orbital ordering @xcite . here , we use transport , neutron scattering and fermi surface measurements to demonstrate that superconducting fes , an isostructure of fese @xcite , is a tetragonal paramagnet without nematic order and with a quasiparticle mass significantly reduced from that of fese .",
    "our neutron scattering experiments in the energy regime below 100 mev reveal only stripe - type spin fluctuations in fes that are not directly coupled to superconductivity .",
    "these properties suggest that fes is a weakly correlated analog of fese and , moreover , that the nematic order in fese is due to the frustrated magnetic interactions underlying the competing checkerboard and stripe spin fluctuations @xcite .",
    "a key to understanding the physics of the iron - based superconductors is to determine the role of magnetism and electronic nematic phase to superconductivity @xcite . in a typical af ordered iron - pnictide , a tetragonal - to - orthorhombic lattice distortion @xmath2 occurs at temperatures above or at the af ordering temperature @xmath3 @xcite , and the nematic phase is observed in the paramagnetic orthorhombic phase between @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite . although iron chalcogenide fese single crystals [ fig .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) ] also undergo a nematic transition at @xmath2 and become superconducting at @xmath4 k @xcite , the low - temperature static af ordered phase is absent @xcite .",
    "this has fueled debates concerning the role of af order and spin fluctuations to the nematic phase and superconductivity @xcite .",
    "initially , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments on fese suggested that magnetism plays no role in its nematic transition @xcite .",
    "however , subsequent neutron scattering measurements reveal strong low - energy spin fluctuations at the stripe af ordering wave vector and a resonance coupled to superconductivity @xcite , similar to spin fluctuations in the iron pnictides @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent spin excitation measurements suggest that the nematic transition in fese is due to a competition between the checkerboard and the stripe spin fluctuations at af wave vectors @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively [ fig .",
    "1(c ) and 1(d ) ] @xcite , consistent with the frustrating magnetic interactions @xcite . in this picture",
    ", one would expect that s - substituted fese@xmath7s@xmath8 , which reduces @xmath2 and lattice orthorhombicity @xcite , should have reduced spin fluctuations associated with the checkerboard order . as fes single crystals are isostructural to fese but with a reduced @xmath9 k , it should allow a direct comparison with fese @xcite , and thus elucidate the role of spin fluctuations to the nematic phase and to superconductivity .",
    "here , we use transport ( fig .",
    "1 ) , neutron scattering ( figs . 2 and 3 ) , quantum oscillation experiments ( fig .",
    "4 ) , as well as density function theory ( dft ) @xcite and dft combined with dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) calculations @xcite to study single crystals of fes @xcite . to search for the presence of a nematic phase in fes , we performed elastoresistance measurements on single crystals of fes and bafe@xmath10ni@xmath11as@xmath12 @xcite using a piezo electric device [ fig .",
    "1(g ) ] @xcite .",
    "figure 1(h ) compares thestrain dependence of the elastoresistance at different temperatures for fes , fese , and bafe@xmath10ni@xmath11as@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "while there is a clear resistivity anisotropy for fese and bafe@xmath10ni@xmath11as@xmath12 , indicative of a nematic phase , fes reveals no anisotropy in measurements of the elastoresistance from 5 k to 105 k. we therefore conclude that fes has no nematic order , which is consistent with the previous reports on fes @xcite and with the notion that the nematic phase vanishes for fese@xmath7s@xmath8 for @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the results from the transport measurements are complemented by those from elastic neutron scattering measurements , which reveal that the system is paramagnetic at all temperatures @xcite , suggesting that the previous observation of magnetic order in fes is likely due to impurity phases @xcite .",
    "having established the absence of any nematic order in fes , we turn to probing the spin excitation spectrum by inelastic neutron scattering experiments .",
    "figure 2 summarizes our neutron time - of - flight measurements on fes to determine the overall wave vector and energy dependence of the spin fluctuations @xcite . for these measurements ,",
    "we use orthorhombic unit cell notation and define momentum transfer @xmath14 in three - dimensional ( 3d ) reciprocal space in @xmath15 as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are miller indices and @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 [ fig .",

    "the energy region probed , @xmath30 increases with increasing energy but has about a quarter of the intensity of fese [ fig .",
    "2(i ) ] .    to determine if spin excitations in fes couple to superconductivity , we carried out temperature dependence measurements of the low - energy spin fluctuations near the stripe ordering wave vector @xmath6 . for this purpose ,",
    "single crystals of fes were aligned in the @xmath31 $ ] scattering plane , and maps of scattering intensity at different energies above and below @xmath0 were measured using a cold neutron spectrometer . figures 3(a)-3(d ) show background subtracted scattering maps at @xmath32 , 2 , 4 and 6 mev , respectively , well below @xmath0 at @xmath33 k. in all cases , we see rod - like scattering centered at @xmath34 with extended scattering along the @xmath19 direction , consistent with short - range @xmath23-axis spin correlations . in the case of fese , a neutron spin resonance coupled to superconductivity was found near @xmath35 mev , which correspond to approximately @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the boltzmann constant , at @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath0 of fes is about half of that of fese , the resonance in fes should be present around @xmath38 mev . to accurately determine the temperature dependence of the dynamic susceptibility near @xmath6",
    ", we integrate the scattering around @xmath6 along the @xmath19 direction , and then fit the profile to a gaussian on a linear background [ see inset in fig .",

    ", we show in fig .",
    "3(e ) the temperature dependence of the dynamic susceptibility @xmath30 near the wave vector @xmath6 .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath30 is weakly temperature dependent below about 10 mev and shows no evidence for a neutron spin resonance expected around @xmath38 mev .",
    "the contrast in the spin dynamics between fes and fese is striking and provides the clue to the physics of both systems .",
    "we start from the observation that , as in the case of p - for - as substitution @xcite , the reduction of fe - pnictogen distance on moving from fese to fes facilitates electron hopping , and thus reduces the electron correlations [ fig .",
    "1(b ) ] , as seen in spin excitations of bafe@xmath12(as@xmath39p@xmath40)@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the notion that fes is a less correlated analogue of fese is qualitatively consistent with our conclusion that the spin spectral weight at low energies is much reduced in fes compared to fese [ fig .",
    "2(i ) ] .",
    "the stoichiometric nature of fes facilitates both quantum oscillation measurements and electronic structure calculations , thereby providing the opportunity to address the correlation physics in a more quantitative way .",
    "we therefore turn to the understanding of both the fermi surface and the effective quasiparticle mass .",
    "figure 1(e ) shows the calculated fermi surfaces of fes using combined dft and dmft @xcite . comparing with schematics of the measured fermi surfaces of fese in fig .",
    "1(f ) @xcite , substituting s for se in fese induces the @xmath41 orbital hole pocket near @xmath5 and changes the properties of the hole pockets near the @xmath42 point @xmath43 [ fig .",
    "1(e ) ] . to quantitatively determine the differences in the fermi surfaces of fes and fese , we performed torque magnetometry and resistivity measurements under high magnetic fields . figure 4 summarizes the quantum oscillatory phenomena observed on fes investigated through torque magnetometry and resistivity measurements under fields as high as @xmath44 in resistive bitter magnets equipped with either a @xmath45 refrigerator or @xmath46 cryostat .",
    "resistivity measurements were performed on a sample characterized by a residual resistivity ratio ( @xmath47 ) of 41 , using a standard four wire technique , while torque was measured through a cantilever beam set - up whose deflection was determined capacitively @xcite .",
    "we were able to observe well pronounced shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) and de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) oscillations in the resistance and in torque measurements , respectively .",
    "typical dhva and sdh oscillations and their respective fast fourier transformations ( fft s ) for @xmath48axis are shown in figs .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) , respectively .",
    "although their amplitudes differ , most of the sdh frequencies observed below @xmath49 , which are indicated by the peaks labeled as @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , are reproduced in the dhva spectrum . only @xmath55 and @xmath56",
    "are not visible in the dhva data .",
    "furthermore , the prominent dhva peaks at @xmath57 and @xmath58 seem to be suppressed in the sdh data , which is attributable to the lower temperature for the torque measurements . here , it is important to emphasize that the sdh - effect is superimposed onto an electrical transport quantity ( resistivity ) which is driven by scattering processes , while the dhva one is superimposed onto a thermodynamic variable ( magnetic susceptibility ) which , in a metal is dependent upon the density of states at the fermi level . therefore , it is not surprising that the relative amplitude between peaks observed in the fft spectra is technique dependent .",
    "in addition , different crystals from a given synthesis batch are likely to display variations in mobility .",
    "this should affect the detection of some of the orbits and hence also produce comparative differences in the fft spectra collected from the different crystals , as seen in our experiments .",
    "the effective mass @xmath59 of the different orbits can be extracted from the temperature dependence of the fft amplitude as depicted in fig .",
    "the decrease of the fft amplitude with increasing temperature is described by the lifshitz - kosevich damping factor @xmath60 .",
    "considering only the first harmonic , one gets @xmath61 , where @xmath62 .",
    "this analysis yields effective masses of @xmath63 for the @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 orbits as well as @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 for the @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 orbits .",
    "thus charge carriers in fes have lower effective masses than those of fese whose masses range from 1.9 to @xmath68 @xcite.notice that we obtain somewhat heavier masses for the @xmath50 and @xmath51 orbits than the values reported in ref .",
    "we re - analyzed our data by , for instance , extracting the effective masses from different field windows .",
    "however , we found that this does not explain the difference between the effective mass values extracted from both studies .",
    "this is consistent with our dft+dmft calculations with mass enhancement @xmath69 of 1.9/1.6 for @xmath70/@xmath71 orbitals in fes , which is much smaller than that in fese @xcite .",
    "the whole angular dependence of the sdh and dhva frequencies as a function of @xmath72 is shown in fig .",
    "4(d ) , where @xmath72 denotes the angle between @xmath17 and the crystallographic @xmath23-axis . based on the dhva measurements",
    ", we observe a multitude of frequencies especially in the region between @xmath73 and @xmath74 as well as at least three additional fermi surface pockets with @xmath75 .",
    "while tracking the individual frequencies that belong to certain fermi surface sheets is a difficult task in the dhva data , the picture seems to become clearer for the sdh oscillations .",
    "nevertheless , we were not able to observe sdh oscillations for @xmath76 .",
    "the lines depicted in fig .",
    "4(d ) are intended to provide a hint on the evolution of the frequencies as a function of @xmath72 . however , a precise comparison with band structure calculations is required to associate the observed frequencies with specific fermi surface sheets @xcite .",
    "band structure calculations find that the fermi surface consists of two - dimensional ( 2d ) cylindrical fermi surface sheets at the center and at the corners of the brillouin zone , respectively @xcite .",
    "2d orbits would lead to a @xmath77 dependence which are not clearly observed here .",
    "although the angular dependence of some of the frequencies ( e. g. @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) could match a cylindrical fermi surface , the bulk of the observed frequencies are clearly 3d in character and can not be described by the currently available band structure calculations . a recent report on the sdh on fes crystals detected only the two main peaks observed in our fft spectra , probably because the measurements were performed at much lower fields @xcite .",
    "however , the authors conclude that the fermi surface of fes has a 2d character in contrast to our observations .",
    "nevertheless , in their study the sdh oscillations were observed in a quite narrow angular range , i.e. @xmath78 with respect to the _ c_-axis , which is not a wide enough range to reach a definitive conclusion on the dimensionality of its fermi surface . on the other hand",
    ", the observation of two of the same frequencies , or cross sectional areas , in samples grown by different groups further confirms that we are detecting the intrinsic fermi surface of fes .",
    "in an attempt to further understand the observed quantum oscillations in figs .",
    "4(a)-4(d ) , we carried out first - principles dft plus single - site dmft calculations in the paramagnetic phase of fes , using the experimentally determined fes crystal structure @xcite and hubbard @xmath79 ev and hund s @xmath80 ev .",
    "when computing the 3d fermi surface and the dhva frequencies , we further incorporated the corrections from the long - range exchange interaction by shifting the hole ( electron ) fermi surface down ( up ) by 50 mev .",
    "the calculated 3d fermi surfaces are shown in fig .",
    "in particular , the middle hole fermi surface and the two electron fermi surfaces are quite 3d like , with large variation of the pocket size ( cross section along the @xmath81 $ ] direction ) along the @xmath82 direction . as shown in fig .",
    "4(f ) , the dft+dmft calculated dhva frequencies agree well with experimental values .",
    "we further assign each dhva frequency to its corresponding position on the 3d fermi surface @xcite .",
    "the reduced strength of the electrons correlations in fes compared to fese also provides the understanding of the contrast in the spin dynamics of fes to those of fese .",
    "figures 4(g ) and 4(h ) show the energy dependence of the ground state magnetic scattering @xmath83 for fes and fese , respectively , calculated through a combination of dft and dmft methods @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion from these calculations is that the spin excitations are much more energetic for fes than for fese , with the strongest scattering for fese occurring below  170 mev , while for fes they extend to well beyond 400 mev similar to the case of iron phosphites @xcite .",
    "it is also instructive to compare the spin dynamics of the superconducting state in fes with the results on fese and iron pnictide superconductors . for most iron - based superconductors , the appearance of superconductivity",
    "is coupled with changes in the spin excitations with the opening of a spin gap , and inducing a neutron spin resonance near the stripe af wave vector @xcite .",
    "the presence of a resonance has mostly been interpreted as due to quasiparticle excitations between the hole - fermi surfaces near the @xmath84point and the electron fermi surfaces near @xmath6 as a consequence of fermi surface nesting @xcite .",
    "given the hole and electron fermi surfaces in fes [ fig .",
    "1(e ) ] and fese [ fig .",
    "1(f ) ] , one would expect the presence of spin fluctuations in both materials at the commensurate stripe af wave vector @xmath6 .",
    "our finding that fes is a weakly correlated analog of fese provides a natural understanding of the lack of a neutron resonance .",
    "more quantitatively , from magnetic and transport measurements , it was argued that fese is deep inside bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) and bose - einstein - condensate ( bcs - bes ) cross - over regime , where the ratio of superconducting gap @xmath85 to fermi energy @xmath86 is of the order of unity @xcite . from the experimentally obtained values for the sdh frequencies @xmath87 and the effective masses @xmath59 in fes , we can estimate the fermi energy @xmath86 by using : @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "assuming that the superconducting gap @xmath85 can be estimated by using the bcs formula for a weakly coupled superconductor for fes : @xmath91 with @xmath92 , we can calculate the ratio of superconducting gap to fermi energy as shown in the table below .",
    "it clearly shows that the electron pairing in fes is much closer to a bcs superconductor , again in line with our finding of a correlation strength in fes that is considerably reduced than that of fese .    to summarize ,",
    "our inelastic neutron scattering experiments below 100 mev indicate that the spin excitations in fes occur at the stripe af wave vector @xmath6 with no observable signal at the checkerboard ordering wave vector @xmath5 , and are much weaker than those of fese ( fig .",
    "the weaker correlations in fes , established by our observation via quantum oscillation measurements of minute enhancement in the effective mass over its non - interacting counterpart , both reduce the low - energy spin spectral weight and push up the energy scale for the @xmath5 excitations .",
    "the weaker correlations also imply that fes is much closer to a bcs superconductor , which allow us to understand why the low - energy spin excitations do not directly respond to superconductivity ( fig .",
    "3 ) . these results for the isostructural and stoichiometric fes highlight the strongly correlated nature of fese . indeed",
    ", the electron spectral weight in fese mainly resides in the incoherent part , which induces quasi - local moments .",
    "the ensuing physics of frustrated magnetism not only yields the nematic order but also is manifested in the co - existing spin excitations at @xmath6 and @xmath5 wave vectors @xcite .",
    "the strong correlations in fese also enhance the effective quasiparticle interactions in its superconducting state , giving rise to a resonance spin excitation in fese @xcite .",
    "as such , our findings elucidate both the origin of the nematic order and the nature of the superconductivity in fese .",
    "our quantum oscillation transport measurements on fes were carried out at national high - magnetic field laboratory in tallahassee , florida @xcite .",
