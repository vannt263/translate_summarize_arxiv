    "_ bsax _ made possible to detect the first x - ray afterglow following grb 970228 whose precise localization ( 1@xmath0 ) led to the discovery of the first optical transient ( or optical afterglow , oa ) associated to a grb [ 1,2 ] .",
    "the oa was afterwards found on earlier images [ 3,4 ] and the light curve exhibited a power - law ( pl ) decay f @xmath1 t@xmath2 with @xmath3 = 1.1 [ 5 ] , thus confirming the prediction of the relativistic blast - wave model [ 6 ] .",
    "pl declines have been measured for 26 oas in 1997 - 2000 yielding values in the range 0.8 @xmath4 @xmath3 @xmath4 2.3 with @xmath5 = 1.35 .",
    "a break deviating from a pl decay was first observed in the grb 990123 light curve at t@xmath6 + 1.5 @xmath7 ( @xmath8 1.5 days after the high energy event ) and it was interpreted as the presence of a beamed outflow with a half opening angle @xmath9 @xmath8 0.1 [ 7 - 9 ] , i.e. reducing the inferred energy by a factor of @xmath8 @xmath9@xmath10/4 .",
    "further breaks have been reported in another 5 grbs : grb 990510 [ 10 - 11 ] , grb 991208 [ 12 ] , grb 991216 [ 13,14 ] , grb 000301c [ 15,16 ] and grb 000926 [ 17,18 ] .",
    "there are six possible explanations for the observed breaks : i ) sideways expansion of the jet caused by the swept - up matter [ 19,20 ] although the effect might be negligible for @xmath9 @xmath11 0.1 [ 21 ] ; ii ) when the jet material propagates in an uniform density medium and the observer sees the edge of the jet , with @xmath3 increasing by @xmath8 0.7 [ 22 ] ; iii ) when the jet material propagates in a medium with a pl density profile and the observer sees the edge of the jet , @xmath3 increases by a factor of @xmath12 [ 22 ] with @xmath13 the bulk lorentz factor ; iv ) when the jet material propagates within a pre - ejected stellar wind ( @xmath14 @xmath1 r@xmath15 ) and the observer sees the edge of the jet , @xmath3 increases by @xmath8 0.4 [ 22 ] ; v ) when in both the relativistic and non - relativistic cases ( if @xmath14 is high ) the inverse compton scattering is important , the light curves can be flattened or steepened [ 21 ] ; and vi ) when the transition from the relativistic phase to the non - relativistic phase of an isotropic blastwave takes place in a dense medium ( @xmath14 @xmath8 10@xmath16 @xmath17 ) [ 23 ] .",
    "rapid fading ( @xmath3 @xmath11 2.0 ) has been observed in 3 grbs : grb 980326 [ 24 ] , grb 980519 [ 25,26 ] and grb 991208 [ 12 ] .",
    "two possible causes can explain such behaviour : the synchrotron emission during the mildly relativistic and non - relativistic phases [ 23 ] and the interaction of a spherical burst with a pre - burst wolf - rayet star wind [ 27,28 ] .      for grb 970508 ,",
    "a `` plateau '' ( @xmath3 = 0 ) was observed between t@xmath6 + 3 @xmath18 and t@xmath6 + 1 @xmath7 [ 29,30 ] .",
    "the optical light curve reached a peak in two days [ 31,32 ] and was followed by a pl decay f @xmath1 t@xmath19 .",
    "the `` plateau '' has been explained by several plasmoids with different fluxes occurring at different times [ 33 ] .",
    "another `` plateau '' was detected in the near - ir light curve of grb 971214 between t@xmath6 + 3 @xmath18 and t@xmath6 + 7 @xmath18 [ 34 ] .",
    "flux fluctuations are expected due to inhomogeneities in the surrounding medium as a consequence of interstellar turbulence or by variability and anisotropy in a precursor wind from the grb progenitor [ 35 ] .",
    "however , short - term variability was found neither in grb 970508 [ 30 ] nor in grb 990510 [ 11 ] . in grb 000301c ,",
    "the high variability observed at optical wavelengths [ 14,15 ] can be due to several reasons : i ) refreshed shock effects ; ii ) energy injection by a strongly magnetic millisecond pulsar born during the grb [ 36 ] ; iii ) an ultra - relativistic shock in a dense medium rapidly evolving to a non - relativistic phase [ 37 ] ; and iv ) a gravitational microlens [ 38 ] .",
    "a peculiar type ib / c supernova ( sn 1998bw ) was found in the error box for the soft grb 980425 [ 39 ] coincident with a galaxy at z = 0.0085 , but this sn / grb relationship is still under debate .    in any case , `` sn - like '' bumps have been detected in other grbs : grb 970228 [ 40,41 ] , grb 970508 [ 42 ] , grb 980326 [ 43,44 ] , grb 980703 [ 45 ] , grb 991208 [ 12 ] and grb 000418 [ 46 ] .",
    "there are some alternative explanations for the existence of such a bump in the oa light curves : i ) scattering of a prompt optical burst by 0.1 m@xmath20 dust beyond its sublimation radius 0.1 - 1 pc from the burst , producing an echo after 20 - 30 @xmath7 [ 47 ] ; ii ) delayed energy injection by shell collision [ 48 ] ; and iii ) an axially symmetric jet surrounded by a less energetic outflow [ 49 ] .",
    "but this is certainly not the case for all grbs : grb 990712 provided the first firm evidence that an underlying sn was not present [ 50 ] .     23.9 and 24.3 respectively .",
    "the dashed - lines are the pure oas contributions to the total fluxes .",
    "the solid lines ( only shown here after t @xmath11 5 @xmath7 ) are the combined fluxes ( oa plus underlying galaxy on each case ) .",
    "upper limits are for grb 991208 . adapted from",
    "[ 12 ] . ]",
    "grb 970508 was the clue to the distance : optical spectroscopy obtained during the oa maximum brightness allowed a direct determination of a lower limit for the redshift ( @xmath21 @xmath22 0.835 ) , implying d @xmath22 4 gpc ( for h@xmath6 = 65 km s@xmath23 mpc@xmath23 ) and e @xmath22 7 @xmath24 10@xmath25 erg .",
    "it was the first proof that grb sources lie at cosmological distances [ 51 ] .",
    "the flattening of the decay at t@xmath6 + 100 @xmath7 [ 30,52 ] revealed the contribution of a constant brightness source -the host galaxy- seen in late - time imaging at t@xmath6 + 1 @xmath26 .",
    "the 15 grb redshifts measured so far are in the range 0.430 @xmath27 z @xmath27 4.50 [ 53 ] with @xmath28 = 1.5 and they were derived either from absorption lines in the oa spectrum , from the ly-@xmath3 break , or from emission lines arising in the host galaxy .      as synchrotron radiation under favourable conditions can be up to 70 % polarized , the first polarimetric observations were attempted for grb 990123 , but only an upper limit was established ( @xmath29 @xmath4 2.3% ) [ 54 ] . polarized optical emission was first detected in grb 990510 ( @xmath29 = 1.7 @xmath30 0.2% ) by means of observations performed at t@xmath6 + 18.5 @xmath18 [ 55 ] , t@xmath6 + 21 @xmath18 and t@xmath6 + 43 @xmath18 [ 56 ] .",
    "this confirmed the synchrotron origin of the blast wave itself and represented another case for a jet - like outflow [ 11 ] .",
    "further polarization measurements were carried out in grb 990712 during a 1 @xmath7 time interval ( at t@xmath6 + 10 @xmath18 , t@xmath6 + 17 @xmath18 and t@xmath6 + 35 @xmath18 ) . in that case , the polarization angle did not vary significantly but the degree of polarization was not constant [ 18 ] which can be explained by a laterally expanding jet [ 57 ] . see also [ 58,59 ] .",
    "significant early optical emission may arise from the reverse shock [ 27,60 ] , i.e. strong optical / near - ir flashes accompanying gamma - ray emission should be a generic characteristic ( at least for typical grbs , with e @xmath8 10@xmath31 erg and @xmath14 @xmath8 1 @xmath17 [ 61 ] ) .",
    "such observations will allow : i ) to derive @xmath13 by the relative timing of optical and @xmath32-ray emission , ii ) to pinpoint the process by which the shells responsible for the external shock arise , and iii ) to constraint the environment .",
    "rotse [ 62 ] achieved the detection simultaneously to the grb of the bright optical emission from grb 990123 [ 63 ] : the most luminous object ever recorded ( fig .",
    "1 ) , with m@xmath33 = @xmath3436 ( peaking at m@xmath33 = 8.9 ) , implying that at least some subsets of grbs do exhibit variable optical emission as violent as the gamma - ray variations .",
    "however , upper limits ( in the range r = 4 - 15 ) were derived for prompt optical emission of a dozen of bursts by means of rotse and other experiments , like lotis [ 64 ] , tarot [ 65 ] , bootes [ 66,67 ] , eon [ 68 ] and concam [ 69 ] .",
    "thus , bright optical counterparts are uncommon .",
    "why most optical flashes are not detected ?",
    "due to several reasons : i ) lack of deeper coverage , given the wide grb luminosity function [ 70 ] ; ii ) fireballs in low - density environments ( @xmath14 @xmath35 1 @xmath17 ) would not be expected to produce strong prompt emission ; iii ) the reverse shock energy is radiated at a non - optical frequency , with the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 or @xmath36 @xmath35 @xmath38 [ 71 ] ; and iv ) highly absorbed grb by dust in their host galaxies .",
    "the first `` dark '' event ( grb 970828 ) was detected as a fading x - ray source [ 72 ] , although no optical counterpart down to m@xmath39 = 24 at t@xmath6 + 4 @xmath18 was detected [ 73 ] .",
    "at least in another three cases ( grb 981226 , grb 990506 and grb 001109 ) , radiotransients were detected without accompanying optical / ir transients . for grb 000210 ,",
    "the x  ray position ( 1@xmath40 accuracy ) coincides with a faint galaxy [ 74 ] .    about 40% of the grbs with x - ray counterparts",
    "do not show oas , and this could be due to : i ) intrinsic faintness because of a low ambient medium ; ii ) lyman limit absorption in high redshift galaxies ( @xmath21 @xmath11 7 ) ; and iii ) high absorption in a dusty enviroment : if grbs are tightly related to star - formation , a substantial fraction of them should occur in highly obscured regions .    )",
    "compared to the detection of optical counterparts in the afterglow era ( since 1997 ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that the fact the no optical afterglows were discovered prior to the bsax launch was just a matter of bad luck ( i.e. the @xmath8 10 events for which prompt deep follow - up optical searches were performed seemed to be either `` rapidly - fading '' or `` dark '' grbs ) . ]",
    "the first optical / near - ir counterparts have been found for @xmath8 30 precisely localized grbs in 1997 - 2000 although they should have been discovered prior to the _ bsax _ launch ( fig .",
    "2 ) . in any case",
    ", only the population of grbs with durations of few seconds has been explored ( see [ 76 ] for a more extensive review ) .",
    "short bursts lasting less than 1 s , that follow the @xmath343/2 slope in the log n - log s diagram ( in contrast to the longer bursts ) remain to be detected at longer wavelengths .",
    "future missions should be able to address some of the issues still to be solved , i.e. prompt optical and near - ir observations should be persued !"
