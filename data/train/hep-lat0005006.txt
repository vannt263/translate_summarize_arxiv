    "for that case , the time - dependence of the pseudoscalar double - hairpin correlator corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig : ozi](b ) was found to be quite well described by a `` double - pole '' form consisting of a @xmath43-independent double - hairpin insertion between a pair of meson propagators ( see also ref .",

    "@xmath44 where @xmath45 is the vacuum - to - one - particle matrix element @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the ( mass)@xmath48 version of the @xmath49 defined previously @xcite ( called @xmath50 in refs .",

    "( [ eq : valencefit ] ) to the valence quark correlator , the double - hairpin vertex insertion @xmath55 can be determined by a one - parameter fit of ( [ eq : fit ] ) to the overall size of the double - hairpin correlator .",
    "a similar analysis of the scalar double - hairpin led to the result quoted in table [ tab : latticeozi ] , while for the other channels such analyses provided the quoted upper bounds for the very tiny mixing amplitudes in these channels .",
    "the most straightforward conclusions of this work are that qcd can explain the ozi rule in channels where it is observed and that it predicts that @xmath39 is large and negative @xcite .",
    "this supports the quark model s explanation of the dynamical suppression of the typical scale of hadron - loop - induced ozi violation below @xmath56 expectations , and in so doing provides further evidence for the standard @xmath1 pair creation amplitude , since this is the critical feature which produces this result .",
    "while the precise consequences are unclear , the implications for phenomenology are serious . with @xmath39 large",
    ", the lightest scalar meson nonet ( the @xmath57 states ) will be close to the @xmath58 limit .",
    "we may therefore expect an octet of scalar mesons in the 1400 mev range with the other @xmath57 states while the nearly singlet scalar state will be substantially lower in mass .",
    "thus the usual assumption of phenomenological analyses that this region will contain the unmixed nonet of @xmath57 states and the scalar glueball is incorrect .",
    "for example , this region might well contain the isoscalar state of the @xmath59 nonet .",
    "in addition , since @xmath39 is comparable to the @xmath60 splitting , there is no reason to assume that either the @xmath57 or @xmath59 singlet s properties can be related by nonet symmetry to those of its octet .",
    "the net effect is that the definitive extraction of the glueball state from the scalar meson spectrum may be quite difficult .",
    "given the importance of this task , it is certainly worthwhile to study the scalar mesons more carefully in the light of this result @xcite . on the lattice it might be possible to obtain the matrix of ozi - violating amplitudes connecting the @xmath61-like and @xmath5-like @xmath57 and @xmath59 states ; in models",
    "the low - lying scalar meson spectrum can be studied including the effects of a strong annihilation channel .",
    "perhaps most critical is to use quenched lattice calculations of the mixed propagators from quarkonia to glueballs @xcite to help resolve the scalar meson ozi violation reported here into the contributions of @xmath62 intermediate states , purely gluonic intermediate states associated with ",
    "true double - hairpin \" graphs , and instantaneous contributions . ultimately , quenched lattice calculations of three - point functions could directly check the predicted negative loop contributions to @xmath39 by measuring the vertex functions which are the  raw ingredients \" of the quark model calculation .",
    "in particular , in other than the @xmath2 channel , one should see the required magnitudes and _ opposite signs _ of the virtual @xmath63-wave decays to two @xmath64 mesons and the @xmath31-wave decays to one @xmath65 and one @xmath64 meson required to build up the near cancellation that is at the heart of the quark model mechanism .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath2 mesons these channels should have the same sign .",
    "the results described here clearly have serious implications for the spectroscopy of @xmath2 states , and define the series of investigations described above required to clarify the physics behind @xmath39 .",
    "such investigations are not only important for their impact on phenomenology , however .",
    "they are also important because our results highlight other more fundamental questions raised long ago by witten @xcite , on the apparent conflict between the instanton solution of the @xmath19 mass ( i.e. , @xmath3 ) problem and the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "the quark model mechanism for the loop contributions to @xmath39 is based on large @xmath0 . while our discussion of the @xmath1 model has focused on its prescription for the quantum numbers of the created @xmath66 pair , it is also an essential ingredient of the model that this pair creates @xmath67 and not @xmath68 mesons , i.e. , that it respects the ozi rule at tree level .",
    "the physical picture behind this feature of the model is that pair creation ( at order @xmath56 ) occurs by the breaking of the color flux tube connecting @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "more generally , as mentioned above , this limit provides the only known field - theoretic basis for the success of not only the valence quark model , but also of regge phenomenology , the narrow resonance approximation , and many of the systematics of hadronic spectra and matrix elements @xcite . in contrast , it is widely believed that the @xmath3 problem is solved through instanton contributions to the axial anomaly . however , as emphasized by witten , instantons vanish like @xmath71 and so do not appear in the large @xmath0 expansion . ",
    "insofar as [ instantons play ] a significant role in the strong interactions , the large @xmath0 expansion must be bad .",
    "it is necessary to choose between the two . \"",
    "@xcite  note that these arguments draw an important distinction between semiclassically calculated instanton effects , which vanish like @xmath71 , and more general topological gauge fluctuations , which _ can _ contribute at order @xmath56 to @xmath72 .",
    "the real issue is not whether there are large fluctuations of @xmath73 in the qcd vacuum , but whether these fluctuations arise as local semiclassical lumps with quantized winding numbers or simply as a result of the generically large gauge fluctuations of a confining vacuum .    to place this conflict in context , recall eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . from section",
    "[ sec : lattice ] it is apparent that the amplitude for any of @xmath74 massless @xmath66 pairs to annihilate to any other pair is the same , i.e. , that @xmath26 does indeed have the form of the @xmath75 matrix shown in eq .",
    "as explained earlier , this is consistent with the t hooft instanton interaction since the  scattering \" amplitude @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) contains a contribution @xmath76 from instantons .",

    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is general and the analyses of ozi violation in refs .",
    "@xcite - - - including that in the pseudoscalar sector - - - are valid .",
    "it follows that from a purely phenomenological perspective it is irrelevant whether or not there is an instanton contribution to hadronic physics : a phenomenology with @xmath77 is  legal \" in any case , since the anomaly allows a resolution of the @xmath3 problem with @xcite or without @xcite instantons .",
    "what remains unclear is the physics behind the annihilation amplitudes .",
    "since a lattice simulation sums over all paths , it contains the instantons as tunnelling events between classical vacua , but the feynman diagrams of qcd , which represent the quantum corrections around these vacua , are incapable of representing instanton physics . thus if instantons are important in qcd , feynman diagrams would have to be supplemented by effective interactions ( like the t hooft interaction ) . as noted by witten @xcite ,",
    "the foremost victim of the failure of feynman diagrams implied if instantons are important would be the large @xmath0 expansion , since it assumes that all - orders properties of the qcd feynman diagrammatic expansion are properties of qcd .",
    "the observations reported in this paper on @xmath39 add one more item to a growing and closely linked set of issues where the physics of instantons and the physics of large @xmath0 confront each other .",
    "assuming that confinement and the nambu - goldstone mechanism @xcite are properties of the all - orders feynman diagrammatic expansion of qcd , the large @xmath0 expansion provides a consistent framework embracing all strong interaction phenomena . among these phenomena",
    "are the hadron spectrum for all flavors of hadrons ( including the @xmath56-suppressed hadronic widths which seem to be critical to @xmath39 ) , the ozi rule ( now including @xmath39 ) , and the @xmath66 condensate . as witten argued long ago @xcite , given the @xmath3 anomaly and confinement , the large @xmath0 limit is also capable of explaining the @xmath19 mass at order @xmath56 _ without _ instantons .    while its limited range of applicability makes it somewhat less attractive for phenomenology",
    "( instantons offer a competing explanation only for the properties of the lightest @xmath78 hadrons),the instanton picture @xcite has received strong support from recent lattice results @xcite .",
    "measurements of the topological charge @xcite of  cooled \" gauge configurations show that in such circumstances this charge is quantized and localized as expected for instantons . moreover , the zero - modes of the dirac operator associated with the solution of the @xmath3 problem and the near - zero - modes associated with the @xmath66 condensate are also localized and in  cooled \" configurations can be associated with these same instantons .",
    "the lattice results on these and other hadronic properties are consistent with the instanton liquid model @xcite .",
    "since , as argued by witten , confinement can replace instantons as the source of the @xmath3 anomaly and since confinement can also produce a space - time localization of the origin of the @xmath19 mass and of the @xmath66 condensate , in our view the true origin of these effects remains unsettled .",
    "the results of this paper may help to resolve this situation since for @xmath39 the two competing pictures lead to mechanisms that are very distinct .",
    "flux - tube - breaking pair creation , a prototypical large @xmath0 phenomenon , led to the prediction that the hadron loop contribution to @xmath39 is large and negative as found here .",
    "moreover , as stated in the beginning of this paper , quark models , with their confined constituent quarks , naturally generate a large positive @xmath23 @xcite . in this case",
    "the loop contribution should be typically small @xcite , and the large positive quark model amplitude is associated with an instantaneous interaction .",
    "instantons , through the instantaneous t hooft interaction , would lead to a superficially similar pattern of ozi violation : a large positive @xmath23 and a large negative @xmath39 .",
    "however , the origins of the large negative @xmath39 are very different in the two cases : the instanton @xmath39 is associated with an instantaneous contribution while the quantitative similarity between the quark model prediction and our measured @xmath39 suggests that this amplitude is associated instead with the meson loop contributions .",
    "our result thus favors the large @xmath0 and not the instanton interpretation of the solution to the @xmath4 mass problem . nevertheless , while suggestive , the quark model prediction is not of sufficient quantitative accuracy for this conclusion to be reliable .",
    "fortunately , with recent advances in lattice methods and in computing power , we believe that the results we have described here can not only be improved but also understood more deeply . in particular , through the program we described of decomposing the ozi - violating amplitudes into their component parts , it should be possible to define the mechanism driving @xmath39 .",
    "we also believe it will be particularly fruitful to define and test confinement - based interpretations of the lattice results on such quantities as the topological susceptibility , the localization of zero modes , the correlation function of the topological charge operator , and the space - time association of the @xmath66 condensate with the topological charge . through such studies ,",
    "the conflict between large @xmath0 and instanton physics can at last be resolved .",

    "<S> the ozi rule is prominent in hadronic phenomena only because ozi violation is typically an order of magnitude smaller than expected from large @xmath0 arguments . with its standard @xmath1 pair creation operator for hadronic decays by flux tube breaking , the quark model respects the ozi rule at tree level and exhibits the cancellations between ozi - violating meson loop diagrams required for this dramatic suppression . </S>",

    "<S> experiment is currently unable to identify these mesons , but we report here on a lattice qcd calculation which confirms that the ozi rule arises from qcd in the vector and axial vector mesons as observed , and finds a large violation of the rule in the scalar mesons as anticipated by the quark model . in view of this result , we make some remarks on possible connections between the @xmath1 pair creation model , scalar mesons , and the @xmath3 anomaly responsible for the large ozi violation which drives the @xmath4 mass . in particular </S>",
