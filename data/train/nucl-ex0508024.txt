    "hadron yields or more specifically yield ratios observed in central nuclear collisions at ags , sps , and rhic energies can be described with high precision within a hadro - chemical equilibrium approach @xcite , governed by a chemical freeze - out temperature t@xmath0 and baryo - chemical potential @xmath1 .",
    "a recent review , found in @xcite , provides a wealth of information on the subject .",
    "the data at sps and rhic energy comprise multi - strange hadrons including the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 baryons .",
    "their yields ratios ( to pions , e.g. ) agree particularly well with the chemical equilibrium calculation and are enhanced by more than an order of magnitude as compared to observations in pp collisions .",
    "we present as an example the results for central au - au collisions at rhic energy in fig .",
    "[ yields ] .",
    "a remarkable exception is observed for strongly decaying , wide resonances . in particular , the @xmath6 ratio is overpredicted while the @xmath7 ratio , both determined in ( rather peripheral , though ) au - au collisions by the star collaboration @xcite , is underpredicted by the model @xcite . for an interesting and provocative speculation as to where this might come from see @xcite .",
    "clearly precision data for central collisions and also at other beam energies are needed to settle this issue .",
    "the chemical parameters t@xmath0 and @xmath1 determined from fits to data at all available energies are plotted in the qcd phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ phase ] , taken ( slightly modified ) from @xcite .",
    "the phase transition lines in this figure are obtained from recent analyses within the framework of lattice qcd @xcite and include recent estimates @xcite of the position of the tri - critical point . also included in this figure",
    "are lines of constant total baryon density and lines of constant energy density , computed within the framework of the hadronic gas model of @xcite .",
    "the line of constant energy density @xmath8 mev/@xmath9 should in our view be a reasonable phenomenological description of the phase boundary .",
    "interestingly , it is , at @xmath10 mev , much closer to the chemical freeze - out points than to the phase lines from lattice qcd .",
    "apparently , the phase boundary lines obtained from state - of - the - art calculations within the framework of lattice qcd are not at all lines of constant energy density .",
    "rather , the energy density grows by more than a factor of 2 when going from 0 to 500 mev in @xmath1 .",
    "this rather surprizing result deserves further attention .",
    "an important observation , already made in@xcite , concerning the results of the thermal model calculations is that , for top sps energy and above , the chemical parameters determined from the measured hadron yields coincide within the uncertainties of about @xmath11 mev with the phase boundary as determined from lattice qcd calculations .",
    "a natural question arises : is this coincidence accidental and , if not , what enforces equilibration at the phase boundary ? considerations about collisional rates and timescales of the hadronic fireball expansion @xcite imply that at sps and rhic energies the equilibrium can not be established in a purely hadronic medium and that is is the phase transition which drives the particles densities and ensures chemical equilibrium .",
    "in @xcite it is further shown that many body collisions become important close to t@xmath12 and provide a mechanism for rapid equilibration .",
    "because of the strong density increase near the qcd phase transition such multi - particle collisions provide a natural explanation for the observation of chemical equilibration at rhic energies and lead to t@xmath0=t@xmath12 within an accuracy of a few mev . any scenario with t@xmath0 substantially smaller than t@xmath12 would require that either multi - particle interactions dominate even much below t@xmath12 or that the two - particle cross sections are larger than in the vacuum by a high factor .",
    "both of the latter hypotheses seem unlikely in view of the rapid density decrease in the hadronic phase of the expanding fireball .",
    "the critical temperature determined from rhic for t@xmath13 coincides well with recent lattice estimates @xcite for @xmath14 .",
    "the same arguments as discussed here for rhic energy also hold for sps energies : it is likely that also there the phase transition drives the particle densities and insures chemical equilibration .",
    "it was alternatively proposed @xcite that the observed hadron abundances arise from a direct production of strange ( and non - strange ) particles by hadronization .",
    "how this happens microscopically is unclear . to escape the above argument that t@xmath0=t@xmath12 one would have to argue that the particle yields are established without hadronic rescattering",
    "this is unlikely since the abundances are determined by hadronic properties ( masses ) with high precision .",
    "second , one may question if the `` chemical temperature '' extracted from the abundances is a universal temperature which also governs the local kinetic aspects and can be associated with the critical temperature of a phase transition in equilibrium .",
    "indeed , in a prethermalization process , different equilibrium properties are realized at different time scales .",
    "nevertheless , all experience shows that kinetic equilibration occurs before chemical equilibration .",
    "it seems hard to imagine that chemical equilibrium abundances are realized at a time when the kinematic distributions are not yet close to their equilibrium values .",
    "the chemical equilibrium curve and the qcd phase boundary as obtained from lattice qcd calculations begin to differ for baryo - chemical potential values of @xmath15 400 mev . despite",
    "that multi - strange baryons are produced with yields very close to what is obtained in a full chemical equilibration scenario ( see below ) .",
    "this could be an indication for new , as yet unidentified equilibration processes , different from those advocated in @xcite and also incompatible with the `` phase space filling '' scenario through hadronization put forward by @xcite , in a dense , baryon - rich medium .",
    "considering the discussion above , a rather radical but appealing possibility is that the chemical freeze - out curve defines the phase boundary also at large @xmath1 values up to @xmath16 mev .",
    "we note in this context that the chemical freeze - out points determined from measurements at sis energy should still be considered with caution as no multi - strange baryons have been measured there .",
    "the relatively smooth energy dependence of the above discussed thermal parameters is to be contrasted with recent observation by the na49 collaboration of an anomaly in the k@xmath17 ratio near @xmath18 gev @xcite .",
    "these results look rather striking , and indeed , the narrowness of the observed structure is missed by the thermal model predictions , as is visible in fig .",
    "[ k2pi ] .",
    "we note , however , that the anomaly seems to be confined to ratios involving light mesons . for strange baryons ,",
    "the situation is quite different , as is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ xiom ] . here , the observed energy dependence is very well reproduced by the calculations and no anomaly is visible .",
    "the situation is even more puzzling considering that the energy averaging inherent in ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions leads to a characteristic smearing of all possible intrinsic structures .",
    "the effect can be estimated @xcite using simple geometrical arguments and is of the order 10 % of the cm .",
    "energy per nucleon at sps energy .",
    "the corresponding width is very close to the width of the structure observed by the na49 collaboration and would imply that the strength of the intrinsic structure is even much larger than visible in fig .",
    "further research is necessary to shed light on this puzzle .",
