    "flows of most liquid substances are usually studied by modeling the liquid as a continuum , but there are some substances that allow the study of flows at the kinetic level , i.e. , at the level of the individual constituent particles . as examples , we can mention chute flows in granular materials  @xcite and capillary flows in colloids  @xcite .",
    "the solid particles in these soft materials are large enough that their motion can be tracked by video microscopy , allowing experimenters to record their positions and velocities . like granular materials and colloids ,",
    "dusty plasmas also allow direct observation of individual particle motion .",
    "dusty plasma  @xcite is a four - component mixture consisting of micron - size particles of solid matter , neutral gas atoms , free electrons , and free positive ions .",
    "these particles of solid matter , which are referred to as `` dust particles , '' gain a large negative charge @xmath2 , which is about @xmath3 elementary charges under typical laboratory conditions .",
    "the motion of the dust particles is dominated by electric forces , corresponding to the local electric field @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is due to confining potentials and @xmath6 is due to coulomb collisions with other dust particles .",
    "due to their high charges , coulomb collisions amongst dust particles have a dominant effect . the interaction force @xmath7 amongst dust particles is so strong that the dust particles do not move easily past one another , but instead self - organize and form a structure that is analogous to that of atoms in a solid or liquid  @xcite .",
    "in other words , the collection of dust particles is said to be a strongly - coupled plasma  @xcite . in a strongly - coupled plasma ,",
    "the pressure @xmath8 is due mainly to interparticle electric forces , with only a small contribution from thermal motion  @xcite .",
    "even when it has a solid structure , a collection of dust particles is still very soft , as characterized by a sound speed on the order of 1  cm / s  @xcite . as a result , a dusty plasma in a solid phase is very easily deformed by small disturbances , and it can be made to flow .",
    "flows can be generated , for example , by applying shear using a laser beam that exerts a spatially - localized radiation force  @xcite .",
    "in such an experiment , the reynolds number is usually very low , typically @xmath9 , indicating that the flow is laminar  @xcite .",
    "this paper provides further analysis and details of the experiment that was reported in  @xcite .",
    "we now list some of the major points of these two papers , to indicate how they are related and how they differ . in this paper",
    ", we present : ( 1 ) a detailed treatment of the continuity equations for both momentum and energy , ( 2 ) our method of simultaneously determining two transport coefficients ( viscosity and thermal conductivity ) , ( 3 ) values of these two coefficients , and ( 4 ) spatially - resolved profiles of the terms of the energy equation , including the terms for viscous heating and thermal conduction , as determined by experimental measurements . in  @xcite",
    ", we reported : ( 1 ) a discovery of peaks in a spatially - resolved measurement of kinetic temperature , ( 2 ) a demonstration that these peaks are due to viscous heating in a region of a highly sheared flow velocity , and ( 3 ) a quantification of the role of viscous heating , in competition with thermal conduction , by reporting a dimensionless number of fluid mechanics called the brinkman number  @xcite which we found to have an unusually large value due to the extreme properties of dusty plasma as compared to other substances .",
    "the values of viscosity and thermal conduction found in this paper are used as inputs for the calculations of dimensionless numbers in  @xcite .",
    "the identification of viscous heating as the cause of the temperature peaks reported in  @xcite is supported by the spatially - resolved measurements reported here .    in the experiment ,",
    "the dust particles are electrically levitated and confined by the electric field in a sheath above a horizontal lower electrode in a radio - frequency ( rf ) plasma , forming a single layer of dust particles , fig .",
    "the dust particles can move easily within their layer , but very little in the perpendicular direction , so that their motion is mainly two dimensional ( 2d ) .",
    "they interact with each other through a shielded coulomb ( yukawa ) potential , due to the screening provided by the surrounding free electrons and ions  @xcite .",
    "as the dust particles move , they also experience frictional drag since individual dust particles in general move at velocities different from those of the molecules of the neutral gas .",
    "this friction can be modeled as epstein drag  @xcite , and characterized by the gas damping rate @xmath10 .    using experimental measurements of their positions and velocities , the dust particles can of course",
    "be described in a _ particle _ paradigm .",
    "they can also be described by a _ continuum _ paradigm by averaging the particle data on a spatial grid . in transport theory ,",
    "momentum and energy transport equations are expressed in a continuum paradigm , while transport coefficients such as viscosity and thermal conductivity are derived using the particle paradigm because these transport coefficients are due to collisions amongst individual particles . in our experiment",
    ", we average the data for particles , such as velocities , to obtain the spatial profiles for the continuum quantities , such as flow velocity . in the continuum paradigm",
    ", a substance obeys continuity equations that express the conservation of mass , momentum , and energy .",
    "these continuity equations , which are also known as navier - stokes equations , characterize the transport of mass , momentum , and energy . in a multi - phase or multi - component substance , these equations can be written separately for each component .",

    "ii , we review the continuity equations for dusty plasmas . in secs .",
    "iii and iv , we provide details of our experiment and data analysis method .",
    "we designed our experiment to have significant flow velocity and significant gradients in the flow velocity , i.e. , velocity shear . in sec .",

    "we will use our experimental data as inputs in these simplified continuity equations in secs .",
    "vi and vii .",
    "we now review the continuity equations for mass , momentum , and energy for dusty plasmas . we will then discuss the significance of some of the terms for our experiments .",

    "equation  ( [ momentum ] ) describes the force per unit mass , i.e. , acceleration , for the continuum .",
    "the confining field @xmath18 and pressure @xmath8 have been discussed in sec .",
    "i. the last term in eq .",
    "( [ momentum ] ) is due to the momentum contribution from forces such as gas friction , laser manipulation , ion drag , and any other forces that are external to the layer of dust particles , as discussed in sec .",
    "the other terms on the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ momentum ] ) correspond to viscous dissipation , which arises from coulomb collisions amongst the charged dust particles .",
    "the viscous term @xmath19 was studied in a previous dusty plasma experiment  @xcite .    for our experiment",
    ", we can consider eq .",
    "( [ momentum ] ) for two conditions , with and without the application of the external force @xmath20 . without the external force ,",
    "the fluid velocity @xmath13 is zero so that eq .",
    "( [ momentum ] ) is reduced to @xmath21 , meaning that the confining electric force is in balance with the pressure ( which mainly arises from interparticle electric forces ) . with the external force ,",
    "the external confining force remains as it was without @xmath20 ; moreover , the pressure @xmath8 will be affected only weakly because the density is unchanged ( as we will show later ) so that the interparticle electric forces that dominate the pressure will also be unchanged .",
    "therefore , in using eq .",
    "( [ momentum ] ) , we will assume that the first two terms on the right hand side always cancel everywhere .    the internal energy equation , as it is expressed commonly in fluid dynamics  @xcite , is @xmath22 here",

    "we assume that the continuity equations , eqs .",
    "( [ mass]-[energy ] ) , are valid for the dust particles separately from other components of dusty plasmas that occupy the same volume , such as neutral gas atoms .",
    "the coupling between the dust particles with other components is indicated in @xmath20 and @xmath25 , so that the momentum and energy of the dust particle motion is treated for the dust particles separately from other components .",
    "other external forces , such as those due to laser manipulation , are also indicated in @xmath20 and @xmath25 .    the first term on the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) is due to viscous heating .",

    ", we will compare the magnitudes of these terms . in  @xcite",
    ", we demonstrated that viscous heating is measurable and significant , when evaluated using only _ global _ measures like the brinkman number .",
    "here we further evaluate viscous heating by characterizing it _ locally _ using spatially - resolved profiles for the terms in eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) .",
    "we also develop a method to simultaneously obtain values of two transport coefficients of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "here we provide a more detailed explanation of the experiment than in  @xcite .",
    "an argon plasma was generated in a vacuum chamber at @xmath27 ( or 2.07 pa ) , powered by rf voltages at @xmath28 and @xmath29 peak - to - peak .",
    "we used the same chamber and electrodes as in  @xcite .",
    "the dust particles were @xmath30 diameter melamine - formaldehyde microspheres of mass @xmath31 .",
    "the dust particles settled in a single layer above the powered lower electrode .",
    "the layer of dust particles had a circular boundary with a diameter of @xmath32 and contained @xmath33 dust particles .",
    "as individual dust particles moved about within their plane , they experienced a frictional damping  @xcite with a rate @xmath34 due to the surrounding argon gas .",
    "the particles were illuminated by a @xmath35-nm argon laser beam that was dispersed to provide a thin horizontal sheet of light , fig .",
    "1(a ) . using a cooled 14-bit digital camera ( pco model 1600 ) viewing from above , we recorded the motion of individual dust particles .",
    "this top - view camera imaged a central portion of the dust layer , as sketched in fig .",
    "the movie is available for viewing in the supplemental material of  @xcite .",
    "the portion of the camera s field of view that we will analyze was @xmath36 , and it contained @xmath37 particles .",
    "we recorded @xmath38 frames at a rate of 55 frame / s , with a resolution of @xmath39 .",
    "our choice of 55 frame / s was sufficient for accurate measurement of various dynamical quantities , including the kinetic temperature , although a slightly higher frame rate would have been optimal  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the top - view camera , we also operated a side - view camera to verify that there was no significant out - of - plane motion ; this was due to a strong vertical confining electric field .",
    "thus , we will analyze the particle motion data taking into consideration only the motion within a horizontal plane .    at first , the dust particles self - organized in their plane to form a 2d crystalline lattice .",
    "the particle spacing , as characterized by a wigner - seitz radius  @xcite , was @xmath40 , corresponding to a lattice constant @xmath41 , an areal number density @xmath42 , and a mass density @xmath43 . using the wave - spectra method for thermal motion of particles in the undisturbed lattice",
    ", we found the following parameters for the dust layer : @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the nominal 2d dusty plasma frequency  @xcite , @xmath2 is the particle charge , @xmath48 is the elementary charge , and @xmath49 is the screening length of the yukawa potential .",
    "we used laser manipulation  @xcite to generate stable flows in the same 2d dusty plasma layer .",
    "a pair of continuous - wave @xmath50-nm laser beams struck the layer at a @xmath51 downward angle . in this manner , we applied radiation forces that pushed particles in the @xmath52 directions , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the power of each beam was @xmath53 as measured inside the vacuum chamber . to generate a wider flow than in  @xcite",
    ", the laser beams were rastered in the both @xmath54 and @xmath55 directions in a lissajous pattern as in  @xcite , with frequencies of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we chose these frequencies to be @xmath58 to avoid exciting coherent waves .",
    "the rastered laser beams filled a rectangular region , which crossed the entire dust layer and beyond , as sketched in fig .",
    "this laser manipulation scheme resulted in a circulating flow pattern with three stable vortices , as sketched in fig .",
    "we designed the experiment so that in the analyzed region the flow is straight in the @xmath52 directions , without any significant curvature .",
    "curvature in the flow , which is necessary for the flow pattern to close on itself as sketched in fig .",
    "1(b ) , was limited in our experiment to the extremities of the dust layer , where it would not affect our observations .",

    "( a ) side - view sketch of the apparatus , not to scale . a single layer of dust particles of charge @xmath2 and mass @xmath59",
    "are levitated against gravity by a vertical dc electric field .",
    "there is also a weaker radial dc electric field @xmath60 which prevents the dust particles from escaping in the horizontal direction .",
    "further details of the chamber are shown in  @xcite .",
    "the two laser beams are rastered in the @xmath55 direction so that they have a finite expanse , and they are offset in the @xmath55 direction as shown in ( b ) .",
    "( b ) top - view sketch of laser - driven flows in the 2d dusty plasma . in the region of interest , the flow is straight , with curvature of the flow limited to the extremities of the dust layer .",
    "a video image of the dust particles within the region of interest is also shown .",
    "the region of interest is divided into 89 bins of width @xmath61 so that particle data can be converted to continuum data . ]",
    "we start our data analysis by analyzing data for individual particles , i.e. , by working in the _ particle _ paradigm . using image analysis software  @xcite , with a method optimized as in  @xcite to minimize measurement error , we identify individual particles in each video image and calculate their @xmath62 coordinates .",
    "we then track a dust particle between two consecutive frames and calculate its velocity @xmath63 as the difference in its position divided by the time interval between frames  @xcite . now having the position and velocity of all the particles in the analyzed region , we can study motion at the particle level .",
    "for example , in sec .",
    "vi we will use data for the individual particles to calculate the rate of their energy dissipation due to their frictional drag with the neutral gas , @xmath25 .",
    "we next convert our data for individual particles to continuum data , i.e. , we change from the _ particle _ paradigm to the _ continuum _ paradigm .",
    "this is done by averaging particle data within spatial regions of finite area , which we call bins .",
    "there are 89 bins , which are all long narrow rectangles aligned in the @xmath55 direction , as shown in fig .",
    "each bin contains @xmath64 dust particles .",
    "we choose the shape of these bins to exploit the symmetry of the experiment , which in the analyzed region has an ignorable coordinate , @xmath54 .",
    "the width of each bin is the same as the wigner - seitz radius , @xmath65 . to reduce the effect of particle discreteness as a particle crosses the boundaries between bins , we use the cloud - in - cell weighting method  @xcite which has the effect of smoothing data so that a particle contributes its mass , momentum and energy mostly to the bin where it is currently located and to a lesser extent to the next nearest bin .",
    "the data are binned in this way regardless of their @xmath54 positions , since @xmath54 is treated as an ignorable coordinate .",
    "we also time - average these binned data , exploiting the steady conditions of the experiment .",
    "this procedure ( binning , cloud - in - cell - weighting , and time averaging ) yields our continuum quantities , such as the flow velocity @xmath66 .",
    "it also yields a kinetic temperature @xmath67 which is calculated from the individual particle velocities ; this kinetic temperature is not necessarily identical to the thermodynamic temperature @xmath24 . here , @xmath68 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "we assume that it is valid to use a continuum model when gradients are concentrated in a region as small as a few particle spacings .",
    "in fact , it has been shown experimentally that the momentum equation  @xcite and the energy equation  @xcite remain useful in 2d dusty plasma experiments with gradients that are as strong as in our experiment .",
    "the notation we use in this paper distinguishes velocities and other quantities according to whether they correspond to individual particles or continuum quantities .",
    "parameters for individual dust particles are denoted by a subscript @xmath69 , for example @xmath63 for the velocity of an individual dust particle .",
    "continuum quantities in a theoretical expression are indicated without any special notation , for example @xmath13 for the hydrodynamic velocities in eqs .",
    "( [ mass ] ) and ( [ momentum ] ) .",
    "finally , continuum quantities that we compute with an input of experimental data , as described above , are indicated by a bar over the symbol , for example @xmath70 .",
    "here , we present our simplification of the continuity equations , eqs .",
    "( [ mass]-[energy ] ) , to describe our 2d dust layer .",
    "these simplifications involve three approximations suitable for the conditions in our 2d layer , and a treatment of two external forces , laser manipulation and gas friction , that are responsible for @xmath20 and @xmath25 .",
    "we describe these simplifications and the resulting continuity equations , next .",
    "the first of our three approximations is @xmath71 .",
    "this approximation is suitable for the steady overall conditions of our experiment . aside from the particle - level fluctuations that one desires to average away ,",
    "when adopting a continuum model , the only time - dependent processes in the experiment were the rastering of the laser beam at @xmath72 and the @xmath28 rf electric fields that powered the plasma .",
    "these frequencies are too high for the dust particles to respond , and the rastering of the beams is not a factor anyway because we will only use the continuum equations outside the laser beams .",
    "the second approximation is that @xmath73 is negligibly small . due to the symmetry in our experiment design , as mentioned in sec .",
    "iii , @xmath54 is treated as an ignorable coordinate , i.e. , @xmath74 . as a verification of this assumption , we observe that the ratio @xmath75 is of order @xmath76 , as a measure of the slightly imperfect symmetry of our experiment .",
    "thus , for our experiment , we consider @xmath77 to be of zeroth order and @xmath73 to be two orders of magnitude smaller , when we approximate eqs .",
    "( [ mass]-[energy ] ) .",
    "the third approximation is that @xmath78 is negligibly small , based on our observation of the flow velocity of our 2d layer .",
    "our results for the calculated flow velocity of the dust layer are shown in fig .",
    "2 . from the velocity @xmath79 in fig  2(a ) , the flow can be easily identified from the two peaks with broad edges .",
    "however , the flow velocity in the @xmath55 direction is two orders of magnitude smaller than in the @xmath54 direction , as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) .",
    "( color online ) .",
    "profiles of continuum parameters during laser manipulation , including ( a - b ) flow velocity , ( c ) areal number density , and ( d ) a measure @xmath80 of local structural order that would be a value of 1 for a perfect crystal  @xcite",
    ". disorder , as indicated by a small value in ( d ) , is found to be greatest where the shear is largest , not where the flow is fastest . ]    using the second and third approximations , and omitting terms that are small by at least two orders of magnitude , we can easily see that we can approximate @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the latter indicates that the dust layer can be treated as an incompressible fluid in our experiment .",
    "using these three approximations in eq .",
    "( [ mass ] ) , we find that @xmath83 . in other words , for our approximations , the density @xmath12 is uniform , which is confirmed by our experimental observation of fig .",
    "because the density is so uniform , we can also assume that plasma parameters , such as the dust charge @xmath2 , are also spatially uniform within the analyzed region .",
    "in addition to these approximations , we also assume that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are valid transport coefficients for our system .",
    "there are theoretical reasons to question whether 2d systems ever have valid transport coefficients , and this is typically tested _ theoretically _ using long - time tails in correlation functions  @xcite",
    ". it could be tested _ experimentally _ by repeating the determination of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for vastly different length scales for the gradients of velocity and temperature and verifying that they do not depend on the length scale .",
    "however , such a test is not practical for experiments like ours , which tend to have a limited range of diameters of dust layers that can be prepared .",
    "now we consider external forces that contribute momentum and energy to the two equations , eqs .",
    "( [ momentum ] ) and ( [ energy ] ) . for our experiment",
    ", we can mention six _ external _ forces acting on the dust layer : gas friction , laser manipulation , electric confining force , gravity , electric levitating force , and ion drag . since we only study the 2d motion of dust particles within their plane , the last three forces are of no interest because they are in the perpendicular direction , and will not affect the horizontal motion of particles that is of interest here .",
    "the electric confining force is balanced by the pressure inside the 2d dusty plasma lattice , @xmath84 , as described in sec .",
    "thus , only two of the six forces need to be considered : gas friction and laser manipulation .",
    "gas friction is the main dissipation mechanism in our experiment .",
    "we can consider the effect of this friction first at the level of a single dust particle , and then at the level of a continuum .",
    "for the _ momentum _ equation , we note first that at the particle level , a single dust particle moving at a speed of @xmath63 experiences a drag acceleration of @xmath85 . at the continuum level , the contribution of this drag to eq .",
    "( [ momentum ] ) is simply the average acceleration experienced by all dust particles in a given spatial region , @xmath86 .",
    "for the _ energy _ equation , at the particle level the rate of energy dissipation for one dust particle is @xmath87 , which is the product of a drag force and velocity , where @xmath88 is the kinetic energy of one dust particle . at the continuum level ,",
    "averaging over all the dust particles in the given spatial region , the rate of energy loss per unit mass in eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) is @xmath89  @xcite .",
    "using the three approximations listed above and taking into account gas friction and laser manipulation forces , the mass , momentum , and energy continuity equations become @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the viscous heating term , after simplifications based on the assumptions of @xmath74 , @xmath94 , and @xmath82 .    in this paper , we will restrict our analysis to a spatial region where the laser force and power are zero , i.e. , @xmath95 and @xmath96 . in this region ,",
    "the momentum and energy continuity equations will be further simplified : @xmath97 @xmath98 to simplify the problem , we will assume that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are independent of temperature , as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we can comment on the meaning of these two equations .",
    "equation  ( [ momentum_dpg ] ) indicates a balance of the sideways transfer of momentum due to two mechanisms : viscosity arising from interparticle electric forces and frictional loss of momentum due to collisions with gas atoms .",
