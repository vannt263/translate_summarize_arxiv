    "a different approach was most recently implemented in [ hk ] where it is shown that some of the results of [ kor1 , kor2 ] can be recovered with a rather crude variational technique .",
    "this method can be easily generalized to the dislocation problem on a strip @xmath55 and then to the plane @xmath6 ; one finds that spectrum of @xmath56 crosses the gap as @xmath57 varies between @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",

    "this basic observation is somewhat reminiscent of a key idea in [ hhk ] where rotationally symmetric schrdinger operators of the type @xmath65 in @xmath66 with @xmath67 periodic and lipschitz - continuous are considered : here , far away from the origin , the potential @xmath68 looks very much like a potential depending only on the @xmath69-coordinate if we restrict our attention to balls of fixed size with centers far out on the @xmath69-axis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 1",
    ", we briefly summarize some results of [ hk ] on translational lattice dislocations for the strip and for the plane .",
    "what we will use in the sequel is the simple fact that , for any @xmath43 , there is some @xmath70 with the following property : for any @xmath41 , there is a compactly supported approximate eigenfunction @xmath71 in the domain of @xmath56 that satisfies @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    in section 2 ,",
    "we first employ the birkhoff ergodic theorem to obtain a set @xmath74 with countable complement so that ( 0.7 ) can be established for small @xmath75 and suitable @xmath76 .",
    "then the above approximate eigenfunctions @xmath71 will also be approximate eigenfunctions of @xmath25 for small @xmath75 , after an appropriate ( @xmath7-dependent ) translation along the @xmath62-axis .",

    "note that theorem 3.2 deals with a much more general situation : in fact , we allow here for two different potentials @xmath14 and @xmath15 on the left and right which are not required to be periodic ; all we need is a common gap .    in section 4",
    "we discuss examples of _ `` muffin tin''_-type which come in three versions : in the simplest case , the muffin tins are circular wells , arranged on a periodic grid , with infinitely high walls ( so that the schrdinger operator is just the direct sum of a countable number of dirichlet laplacians on circles ) .",
    "we then approximate by muffin tins of finite height , and , finally , by muffin tins with lipschitz potentials .",
    "we obtain spectral results for the rotation problem for all three versions .    in section 5 ,",
    "finally , we first explain a simplified model for small angle grain boundaries where we assume rotation by an angle @xmath82 in both half - planes in opposite direction ; this problem is somewhat easier to deal with .",
    "we furthermore discuss special rotation angles @xmath7 for which the operators @xmath25 are periodic in the @xmath62-direction and thus have no singular continuous spectrum [ ds ] .",
    "all these question hinge on an approximate or exact matching up between the given periodic potential in the right half - plane and its rotated version in the left half - plane .",
