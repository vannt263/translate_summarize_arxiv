    "measurement of a physical system with an arbitrary precision is an important task in many fields of experimental physics and technologies .",
    "the ultimate goal of the precision measurement is to attain the highest accuracy when a physical system is measured at a cost of given resources . in a real situation",
    ", the aim is needed to be achieved under the constraint of limited resources such as the finite number of trials and the limited duration time of the experiment .",
    "this situation is also true in the case of ramsey spectroscopy experiment which is a scheme to measure the dynamical evolution of an atomic state and estimate the resonance frequency of the atomic state @xcite .",
    "although precision in the measurements can be improved with the number of trials , it is also true that the limited resource restricts the possible number of repetitions of the measurement .",
    "therefore , it is required to devise a method how to utilize the given resources as efficient as possible .",
    "a possible method to achieve a higher accuracy in the precision measurement is to employ quantum entanglement .",
    "the examples are to use coherent - squeezed state in gravitational wave detector @xcite , number entangled states of photons ( so - called noon states ) in mach - zehnder interferometer @xcite and ghz states of atoms in frequency estimation with ramsey spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the conventional measurement scheme that allows us to attain the shot - noise limit only , @xmath0 @xcite , the scheme with entangled states helps us to obtain the heisenberg limit , @xmath1 @xcite where @xmath2 is an unknown parameter to be measured and @xmath3 is the number of employed resources .",
    "however , the precision measurement scheme is sometimes restricted if a prior knowledge about the value of a parameter to be measured is not provided . in the case of phase estimations , there is recent work about an estimation scheme that is performed by using entangled coherent states without a prior knowledge about an unknown phase @xcite .",
    "the reason that the precise estimation of a completely unknown phase is possible is that without any prior knowledge about the unknown phase , we know that phases lie in @xmath4 . in general , the precision measurement scheme is only useful when we try to achieve a better precision on vaguely known values . if we do not have any knowledge on the measurement values , the scheme does not work well .",
    "especially , when there is periodicity of probabilities in each measurement , the measurement data can not be used to specify the single value of phase estimation and results in more than one estimation value over the period .",
    "thus , if we do not know the range of the parameter sharp enough , it is not possible to estimate the precise value of its phase and leaves ambiguity .",
    "since the period of probabilities for the measurement with entangled states is even shorter than that of unentangled states , entanglement - based measurements give rise to a more serious ambiguity problem in the determination of an estimation value .",
    "it can be shown that in the scenario having a prior knowledge on the periodicity , the measurement scheme with highly entangled states merely attains an equal precision to that with uncorrelated states in the frequency estimation .",
    "therefore , there will be no benefit of using entangled states in the case with limited _ a priori _ knowledge provided . here",
    ", we propose measurement schemes that allow us to overcome the ambiguity of @xmath5 periodicity and , at the same time , obtain a better precision beyond the shot - noise limit using quantum entanglement .",
    "there have been prior discussions that , when highly entangled states are used , periodicity of probabilities in each measurement outcome sometimes prevents us from determining a unique estimation value and it can be overcome in idealized cases @xcite . in the works , two different settings are considered ( i ) using ghz states with particle numbers @xmath6 , and ( ii ) using combinations of an uncorrelated state and ghz states in order to avoid ambiguity . each scheme has been discussed in interferometric systems for phase estimation and the introduced decoherence model was photon losses . in this paper , we consider more general situation with a different decoherence effect that occurs in trapped ions .",
    "we compare the results of the two schemes in the absence of decoherence and in the presence of decoherence , and conclude that while the first scheme allows us to achieve the heisenberg limit in the ideal case , the second scheme becomes more advantageous as the decoherence rate increases and attains a sub shot - noise precision .",
    "we organize this article in the following . in section 2 ,",
    "we review frequency estimation procedure in ramsey spectroscopy when the atoms are uncorrelated and correlated under decoherence effects .",
    "furthermore , we bring up an ambiguity problem that occurs in the frequency estimation . in section 3 ,",
    "we analyze two different schemes that overcome the ambiguity problem and , at the same time , improve precision by using entanglement , and compare the attainable precision of the proposed schemes with that of the conventional scheme using no entanglement .",
    "finally , we summarize our works in section 4 .",
    "ramsey spectroscopy is the measurement technique of transition frequency @xmath7 between the internal states of two - level atom @xcite .",
    "the system can only take one of two energy levels as they can denote the ground state @xmath8 and the excited state @xmath9 .",
    "standard ramsey spectroscopy is operated as following .",
    "initially , prepare @xmath3 ionized atoms confined in an ion trap @xcite and by optical pumping technique @xcite , change the state of atoms into the same ground state , @xmath10 .",
    "then , the atoms are applied by @xmath11 pulse which leads each atom to be in the superposition state of the ground state and the excited state , @xmath12 .",
    "after that , ( classical ) fields with frequency @xmath13 are applied to the atoms for interrogation time @xmath14 so that the state changes to @xmath15 in a rotating frame , where @xmath16 denotes the detuning between the atomic transition and classical driving field .",
    "finally , the atoms are applied by the second @xmath11 pulse which changes the state to @xmath17 , and the internal state of each atom is measured by scattering light and detecting the fluorescence with a photomultipier ( pmt ) .",
    "we estimate the transition frequency @xmath7 by counting the number of atoms in the excited state @xmath9 and using the probability of detecting the excited state @xmath9 in each atom which is given as @xmath18 the probability of detecting the ground state is given as @xmath19 . the operation of ramsey spectroscopy is shown in fig [ ramseypicture ] .    from its functional form",
    ", the probability @xmath20 can be used to estimate the frequency @xmath7 of the atomic state within a certain precision .",
    "the statistical fluctuation in the estimation which is associated with the given probability @xmath20 can be obtained by using cramr - rao inequality @xcite , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the fisher information and @xmath23 is the number of repetition of trials .",
    "@xmath24 is the conditional probability of obtaining a result @xmath25 with a given parameter @xmath2 and the summation is taken over all possible results .",
    "the fisher information is a quantity that measures how much information can be obtained when the parameter @xmath2 is changed infinitesimally .",
    "it is known that the lower bound of the cramr - rao inequality can be achieved asymptotically by the maximum likelihood estimator @xcite .",
    "the fisher information plays an important role in estimation theory in that it gives a lower bound of statistical fluctuation .",
    "is @xmath26 and the probability of detecting @xmath9 is @xmath27 in the ideal case . ]    in ramsey spectroscopy , the unknown parameter to be estimated is the transition frequency @xmath7 between two internal states @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "using the fact that possible results are the excited state @xmath9 with the probability @xmath20 and the ground state @xmath8 with the probability @xmath28 , the cramr - rao lower bound is easily obtained as @xmath29 is the repetition of trials and @xmath30 is the total experimental time .",
    "thus , the precision with @xmath3 atoms is proportional to @xmath31 , which is so - called the _ shot - noise limit _ @xcite .",
    "the shot - noise limit is originated from quantum projection noise .",
    "note that the precision @xmath32 is independent of the transition frequency @xmath7 with ignorance of decoherence effects .",
    "so far , we have discussed in the ideal case . however , in a realistic experiment , it is necessary to include the effects of decoherence . as a realistic case",
    ", we introduce a model that was proposed in @xcite . in this model ,",
    "dephasing of individual ions is the main decoherence , which is caused from collisions , stray fields , and laser instabilities .",
    "the effects of decoherence on a single ion @xmath33 can be described as the master equation in lindblad form @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the decay rate and @xmath36 denotes a pauli spin operator .",
    "( [ decoherence ] ) is written in a rotating frame .",
    "the effect of decoherence is shown in the broaden signal ( [ p1 ] ) of a single ion : @xmath37 and again using cramr - rao inequality ( [ cramer ] ) , the corresponding precision changes to latexmath:[\\[\\label{deco }    it can be found that as the decay rate @xmath35 increases , the uncertainty becomes larger .",
    "in contrast to the ideal case , a precision in the presence of decoherence is dependent to the frequency @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath39 @xmath40 is odd@xmath41 and @xmath42 are satisfied , minimum uncertainty is obtained as latexmath:[\\[\\label{minuncertainty }    note that minimum uncertainty is attained when the probabilities of obtaining the measurement outcomes @xmath8 and @xmath9 are same .",
    "we have studied standard ramsey spectroscopy using @xmath3 atoms , which allows us to obtain a shot - noise limit .",
    "it has been proposed that entanglement between atoms improves sensitivity of phase .",
    "especially , one of the states that has been proposed to improve precision is maximally entangled multipartite state which is so - called greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the ghz states accumulate @xmath3 times amplified phase information than without entanglement , which results in a better precision .",
    "implementation of ghz states among atoms has been demonstrated by cirac _ et .",
    "_ @xcite and it will be explained in the following .",
    "the preparation procedure of ghz states is , in principle , that after all @xmath3 atoms are prepared in the ground state @xmath47 , the first ion is applied by @xmath11 pulse to create the state @xmath48 and the ions are operated by a `` controlled - not(cnot ) '' gate , the first ion as a controlled qubit and the second ion as target qubits to entangle the first two atoms , which changes the state to @xmath49 . continuing the operation of cnot gates , the first ion as controlled qubit and other ions as target qubits , the final state becomes the ghz state @xmath50 . despite theoretical straightforwardness of generating ghz states ,",
    "it is known that large size ghz states are extremely difficult to create in practice @xcite .",
    "after preparation of ghz states , ( classical ) fields of frequency @xmath13 are applied to the atoms for interrogation time @xmath14 , which changes the state to @xmath51 .",
    "finally , the atoms are disentangled by the second set of controlled - not gates and the internal state of the first ion is measured .",
    "again , we estimate the true frequency by the measurement outcomes and the probability of detecting @xmath9 , @xmath52 which denotes the probability of detecting all @xmath3 atoms in the excited state .",
    "the probability of detecting all @xmath3 atoms in the ground state is given as @xmath53 .",
    "the principle that ghz states allow us to obtain a better precision is originated from the fact that the phase shift of ghz states in interrogation time is amplified @xmath3 times than without entanglement in the same period , which results in the change of the probability of detecting @xmath9 .    as the previous single ion case , using the cramr - rao inequality ( [ cramer ] )",
    ", we attain a @xmath54 improved precision than that of uncorrelated @xmath3 atoms ( [ uncor ] ) , @xmath55 is the repetition of trials .",
    "now , uncertainy of frequency is proportional to @xmath56 , which is referred to as the heisenberg limit . as the previous case",
    ", uncertainty does not depend on the frequency in the ideal case .",
    "taking into account decoherence , similarly to uncorrelated states , we can easily see that the signal ( [ pn ] ) of ghz states with @xmath3 ions becomes @xmath57 and uncertainty of frequency becomes latexmath:[\\[\\label{ghzdeco }    the exponential part in the denominator indicates that if @xmath3 is too large , uncertainty @xmath59 goes to infinity , which means that a large size of ghz state is fragile against decoherence . again",
    ", uncertainty depends on the frequency and minimum uncertainty is achieved when @xmath60 @xmath40 is odd@xmath41 and @xmath61 are satisfied .",
    "minimum uncertainty is obtained when the probabilities of obtaining each result @xmath8 and @xmath9 are same . as a consequence ,",
    "minimum uncertainty is same with that of uncorrelated states ( [ minuncertainty ] ) .",
    "therefore , in the presence of decoherence ghz states do not help attaining a better precision than that of uncorrelated states @xcite .",
    "let us consider a realistic experiment of frequency estimation with basic concepts of ramsey spectroscopy . basically , an estimation process is proceeded based on measurement outcomes which depend on the parameter to be estimated and the probability of obtaining the experimental data . in ramsey spectroscopy ,",
    "measurement outcomes are consisted of @xmath8 and @xmath9 only , and the probability of detecting the excited state @xmath9 is given in ( [ p1 ] ) for a single atom .",
    "the probability ( [ p1 ] ) that we use in an estimation process has periodicity , which is shown in fig [ periodicity ] .",
    "a difficulty of frequency estimation comes from the periodicity because the periodicity prevents us from distinguishing a true estimate of frequency among a number of possible estimates .",
    "for example , let us suppose that the true frequency @xmath63 is zero ( we set @xmath64 for simplicity i.e. @xmath65 . ) , which leads to the measurement outcome @xmath9 at all @xmath3 atoms . then , our estimate obtained by the measurement outcomes is not @xmath66 but @xmath67 ( @xmath68 an integer ) .",
    "our estimation result is not unique .",
    "in other words , since two different frequencies @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( @xmath68 , @xmath71 integers ) give the same experimental data , the data does not allow us to choose a single estimate of frequency . hence , even after obtaining measurement outcomes , we are still required to determine a single estimation value .",
    "determination of a unique estimate can be possible with the help of a prior knowledge about the true frequency @xmath7 .",
    "if a provided prior knowledge about the true frequency is narrow enough to choose a unique estimate , the ambiguity problem is avoided .",
    "if a given prior knowledge is not enough narrow , we still have ambiguity in the estimation procedure . in short , because of periodicity , even when we try infinitely many measurements , it is not possible to determine a single estimation value without an appropriate prior knowledge .",
    "thus , we are required to know about the true frequency initially with an enough degree of accuracy to choose a single estimation value so that we assume that an arbitrary prior knowledge about @xmath7 is always given in this paper .    * ( a ) * +    [ fig : combi ]     when @xmath72 .",
    "( a ) periodicity of the probability distribution causes ambiguity in determining a single peak among the values in the periodic repetitions . if one knows that @xmath73 , the estimate of @xmath7 can be taken from any values among @xmath74 and @xmath75 . in order to avoid the ambiguity , we need to change the interaction time @xmath14 three times smaller than original . the new choice of interaction time allows us to discriminate the peak value of @xmath7 at @xmath75 from @xmath74 .",
    "( b ) probability distibution of a single atom ( blue ) in an excited state and that of ghz states with @xmath76 atoms ( purple ) are shown .",
    "if we know @xmath77 initially , the best choice of interrogation time is @xmath72 .",
    "if we use a single atom , an estimation can be uniquely determined as @xmath78 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we use ghz states with @xmath76 atoms , the estimation becomes ambiguous because our estimation value is @xmath79 and @xmath75 . to avoid the ambiguity , we need to choose @xmath14 three times smaller , which leads to the same uncertainty @xmath32 with the scheme without ghz correlation.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig : combi ]    in this situation ,",
    "let us suppose that we are trying to improve precision .",
    "when we use @xmath3 atoms , the ultimate precision is given as ( [ uncor ] ) . under a restriction of the limited number of atoms @xmath3 and a given total duration time @xmath30 ,",
    "a possible choice to improve preicision is increasing interrogation time @xmath14 , since uncertainty of the frequency @xmath32 decreases as the interrogation time @xmath14 increases .",
    "hence , we can increase the time @xmath14 as possible in the only restriction @xmath80 where @xmath30 is sufficiently large .",
    "however , as the interrogation time @xmath14 increases , the period @xmath81 of the signal ( [ p1 ] ) becomes shorter so that it causes ambiguity in determining a unique estimation value because a more number of frequencies become a possible estimation value as the period becomes shorter .",
    "in other words , the shorten period makes it harder to distinguish a true frequency from other possible estimates .",
    "thus , while the longer interrogation time @xmath14 allows a better preicision , the increased interrogation time @xmath14 requires a narrower prior knowledge about the true frequency @xmath7 in order to determine a unique estimation value .",
    "let us suppose that we know that the true frequency @xmath7 lies in the interval @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a positive number . under the prior knowledge , the largest possible value of interrogation time @xmath14 that allows us to determine a single peak is @xmath83 .",
    "then , the possible maximum interrogation time @xmath84 leads uncertainty to be @xmath85 .",
    "it implies that minimum uncertainty of frequency estimation depends on the accuracy of a prior knowledge about the true frequency . in other words , if we know the true frequency more accurately at the beginning , we can obtain a better precision .",
    "as previously discussed , quantum entanglement between atoms help us to improve precision of frequency estimation .",
    "let us consider introducing quantum entanglement between atoms by exploiting ghz states under the same prior knowledge that @xmath86 .",
    "similar to the unentangled state case , the signal of ghz states with @xmath3 atoms has a period @xmath87 from ( [ pn ] ) .",
    "therefore , the largest possible @xmath14 that allows us to choose a single estimation value is @xmath88 . eventually , uncertainty obtained by using ghz states is same with ( [ noprior ] ) .",
    "the reason that uncertainty with uncorrelated state and with ghz state is same is that the period of signal with ghz states is @xmath3 times shorter than that of uncorrelated state so that we need to use a shorter interrogation time to avoid ambiguity in the estimation process .",
    "consequently , in the consideration of a prior knowledge about the frequency , exploiting ghz states does not improve precision , which is shown in fig [ periodicity ] .",
    "however , it does not mean that ghz states are useless in improving the precision of frequency because it obviously has a better sensitivity locally .",
    "we introduce useful schemes that utilize the potential power of ghz states and improve precision , avoiding ambiguity .",
    "in this section , we analyze two measurement schemes to overcome ambiguity in frequency estimation of atomic states . basic settings of the schemes are originally proposed by pezze _ et .",
    "_ @xcite and gkortsilas _ et .",
    "however , their schemes are limited either in the case of ideal measurement or in the case with photon losses . here , we apply the schemes to frequency estimation with atomic ghz states in the presence of decoherence .",
    "decoherence effects on atomic states are different with photon losses in photonic states .",
    "since photon losses can be recognized by comparing the number of detected photons with that of input photons , one is able to exclude measurement outcomes where photon losses occurred .",
    "thus , one takes perfect measurement outcomes only in the estimation process . on the other hand , detection of internal states of atoms",
    "does not give any information whether decoherence had an effect on the atomic states .",
    "therefore , all the measurement outcomes should be taken into account including atoms that were affected by decoherence .",
    "as such , decoherence in atomic states is different with photon losses .",
    "the first scheme is using ghz states with @xmath89 numbers of particles in order .",
    "it is known that this scheme allows phase estimation with the heisenberg limit in the ideal case .",
    "the second scheme is using combinations of an uncorrelated state and ghz states .",
    "the two schemes behave differently and give different precisions depending on the degree of decoherence effects .",
    "we analyze the two schemes in frequency estimation , considering decoherence effects on atomic states .",
    "before we introduce details of the schemes , let us review bayesian analysis .",
    "let us suppose that we know that the true frequency lies in @xmath90 again , and we choose @xmath84 which leads to the best sensitivity avoiding ambiguity for an uncorrelated state . according to the bayes theorem , the posterior probability distribution @xmath91 , given total resources @xmath92 and a data set of measurement outcomes @xmath93 , when @xmath94 , is given as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a prior distribution of @xmath7 and is completely flat for an unknown frequency , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 is treated as a normalization constant .",
    "the posterior probability @xmath99 is a conditional probability of frequency @xmath7 based on a data set @xmath100 of measurement outcomes obtained by using @xmath92 resources .",
    "we choose the maximum of the distribution as estimator @xmath101 and uncertainty @xmath32 given by @xmath102 when @xmath91 goes to normal distribution .",
    "bayesian analysis allows us to obtain the estimation value and associated uncertainty by using measurement outcomes .",
    "+     +   +     ( a ) preparation of ghz states with 1,2 and 4 atoms .",
    "the connection line between atoms denotes ghz correlation .",
    "( b ) using ghz states with 1,2 and 4 atoms , the overall probability distribution ( blue solid line ) has only a single peak .",
    "a prior knowledge about frequency is @xmath77 .",
    "orange , red and green dotted lines denote probability distributions of using ghz states with 1 , 2 , and 4 atoms , respectively . ]",
    "let us consider the first scheme : exploiting ghz states with particle numbers @xmath105 .",
    "note that we have assumed that we know that @xmath106 so that we have fixed the interrogation time @xmath84 .",
    "now let us suppose @xmath107 for simplicity . in this case , if we use a single atom , the probability of detecting the ground state and that of the excited state are same .",
    "thus , the precision is maximum in the presence of decoherence .",
    "however , if we use ghz states with even number of atoms , the measurement outcomes are either all @xmath8 or all @xmath9 where the precision is minimum for the realistic case , which is implied by ( [ ghzdeco ] ) .",
    "thus , for ghz states with the even number of atoms , we need to apply an additional phase shift @xmath11 in order to change the overall phase shift into one that gives minimum uncertainty where the probabilities of detecting @xmath8 and @xmath9 are same .",
    "then , the effective frequency for ghz states with the even number of atoms is @xmath108 .",
    "asymptotically , when we use ghz states of @xmath3 atoms ( if @xmath109 , a single atom state ) with the number of trials @xmath23 in frequency estimation , we obtain @xmath110 number of the ground state and @xmath111 number of the excited state .",
    "due to the additional phase shift , the effective frequency @xmath112 is @xmath113 for ghz states with even @xmath3 atoms and @xmath63 for a single atom .",
    "therefore , by using the bayes theorem ( [ bayes ] ) , when we use ghz states of particle number @xmath105 with repetition @xmath114 , the probability distribution in the ideal case becomes @xmath115^{\\nu/2}\\prod_{k=1}^{p-1}[\\cos^2(2^k\\omega_0 t/2-\\pi/4)\\sin^2(2^k\\omega_0 t/2-\\pi/4)]^{\\nu/2}\\nonumber \\\\",

    "since it achieves the heisenberg limit in the ideal case , apparently this scheme is helpful to utilize ghz states under a prior knowledge and to improve precision .",
    "nevertheless , this scheme is extremely fragile against decoherence because it exploits a large size of ghz states .",
    "the result of the first scheme in the presence of decoherence indicates that it is required to use a number of uncorrelated atoms that are more robust against decoherence than ghz states .",
    "therefore , we need to introduce another scheme that is more robust against decoherence in a realistic situation .",

    "therefore , it can be considered to use different various combinations depending on the decoherence rate @xmath35 .",
    "we have assumed that the true frequency @xmath7 is @xmath138 in the both schemes because the best sensitivity is attained at @xmath138 for uncorrelated atoms in the realistic case .",
    "if the phase shift @xmath139 is not @xmath11 , we need to modify the phase shift to be @xmath11 in order to attain minimum uncertainty , which is realizable by a feedback mechanism @xcite . a feedback mechanism is implemented by the bayesian analysis on the collected data .",
    "after each trial , we apply an additional phase shift which is determined by the bayesian analysis to make the total phase shift to be @xmath11 . for every trial",
    ", we repeat this process and then total phase shift becomes @xmath11 which gives minimum uncertainty of frequency .",
    "one of the advantages in the second scheme is that it does not require a large size of ghz state which is experimentally difficult to generate and has a short coherence time @xcite .",
    "indeed , the largest ghz states that we have used in the numerical optimization are those of 5 atoms in both the ideal case and the realistic case .",
    "it indicates that our scheme is practical as well as useful .",
    "nevertheless , since generating ghz states requires extremely delicate experiment and the coherence time is very short , realization of our scheme may necessitate more advanced experiment devices and skills than current .",
    "periodicity of probability distribution causes ambiguity in the frequency estimation process . furthermore , in the consideration of a prior knowledge , exploiting ghz states does not help improving precision of frequency estimation when one uses only ghz states with the same number of atoms . in order to avoid the ambiguity and utilize ghz states for improvement of precision , we implement two different schemes",
    "the first scheme is employing ghz states with @xmath6 atoms , which improves precision significantly in the ideal case .",
    "nevertheless , since a large size of ghz states is fragile against decoherence , the first scheme is no longer advantageous in the realistic case .",
    "the second scheme that is robust against decoherence is exploiting appropriate combinations of uncorrelated atoms and ghz states .",
    "as the decoherence rate @xmath35 increases , it is shown that the sensitivity of second scheme can be better than that of the first scheme .",
    "in addition , we conclude that the scheme with combinations of uncorrelated and ghz states allows us to achieve a sub shot - noise precision in the presence of decoherence .",
