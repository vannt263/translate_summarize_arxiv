    "the broad peaks observed in magnetic - diffraction pattern of the compound , arising from the diffuse scattering at low temperatures ( @xmath11 ) have been attributed partly to spin waves ( for @xmath12 ) and partly ( for @xmath13 ) to short range 2d magnetic correlations . in this paper",
    ", we represent a spin - wave analysis of the problem at low temperature taking into account the spin fluctuations within the tyablikov s decoupling approximation ( tda)@xcite on top of the mean - field linear spin wave ( lsw ) results and study the temperature dependence of the magnetic properties such as magnon dispersion , magnetization and spin susceptibility .",

    "the higher energy nearly degenerate two other magnon modes are responsible for the diffused magnetic scattering peaks at values of q which are smaller compared to that for the pristine compound .",

    "the parallel susceptibility at zero field is obtained at low temperature which can well complement qmc data that shows enough finite size effect at low t.    further a spin wave study for the @xmath4-substituted compound @xmath16 shows the multiple magnon modes obtained as a result of structural modification .",
    "the six superlattice structure creates small size bz in the system which is also evident from the structure factor plot ( fig.[fig8 ] ) .",
    "the magnon dispersions also confirm the quasi-1d nature of the underlying spin lattice .",
    "we should mention here that our computer - designed compound @xmath16 has an ordered sublattice structure between v and ti .",
    "our model , therefore , represents an idealistic situation where any possible interchange of the ti and v ion occupied sites , that may occur in actual synthesis of such compound , is not considered .",
