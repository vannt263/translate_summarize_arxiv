    "many years , orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) has received enormous attention . due to the fact that ofdm has high peak - to - average power ratio ( papr )",
    ", many papers tried to mitigate the papr problem .",
    "partial transmit sequence ( pts ) and selected mapping ( slm ) can be a good answer to solve the papr problem @xcite .",
    "pts and slm generates alternative ofdm signal sequences . among them , the one with the minimum papr is selected for transmission . since these schemes have high computational complexity , low complexity schemes are proposed .",
    "besides , many other techniques such as clipping , tone reservation , and tone injection are also proposed .    above schemes",
    "are focused on reducing the papr , but recently , many other metrics are proposed to improve the bit error rate ( ber ) performance when the presence of nonlinear high power amplifier ( hpa ) .",
    "intermodulation distortion ( imd ) @xcite , distortion - to - signal power ratio ( dsr ) @xcite , mean squared error ( mse ) @xcite , and single point correlation ( corr ) @xcite outperform the papr metric in terms of ber performance .    in section [ sec : corr ] , we briefly review the corr metric and show that corr is the optimum metric in terms of ber performance . in section [ sec : os ] , oversamplig effect of corr is analyzed when the presence of nonlinear hpa in slm scheme .",

    "binary data sequences are modulated by @xmath0-ary quadrature amplitude modulation ( qam ) constellation .",
    "then , an oversampled input symbol sequence @xmath1 , @xmath2 $ ] is inverse fourier transformed ( iffted ) , where @xmath3 is the number of subcarriers .",

    "[ fig : slm_corr ] shows a block diagram of slm scheme with corr metric .",
    "conventional slm scheme generates @xmath9 alternative ofdm signal sequences by componentwise multiplication of input symbol sequence and @xmath9 different phase sequences .",

    "the signal with maximum corr is selected for transmission .",
    "pts scheme with corr is treated in @xcite , but in this letter , we treat slm scheme with corr since slm scheme is a general scheme .    in @xcite , analytic ber of slm scheme",

    "thus , we focus on corr metric among many metrics targeting the ber performance and describe the oversampling effect in slm scheme with nonlinearity .",
    "based on @xcite , oversampled signal can be achieved by linear combination of nyquist rate samples .",
