    "` cosmic ' production of fluorine is difficult because fluorine is very easily destroyed in stellar interiors and therefore has to be deposited into the interstellar medium soon after its production . because of this sensitivity to the conditions of its production site",
    ", the ` cosmic ' fluorine abundance will not only put a severe constraint on the chemical evolution models describing different stellar populations , but also on stellar evolution models .",
    "three production sites / mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to the ` cosmic ' fluorine abundance : thermal - pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) stars , @xmath0 nucleosynthesis in supernovae type ii ( sneii ) , and/or wolf - rayet ( w - r ) stars ( see for further details ) .",
    "so far , only the production of fluorine in agb - stars has been proven by observations : by direct measurements of fluorine abundance in agb - stars , by measurements of fluorine in post agb - stars and planetary nebulae as well as in carbon - enhanced metal - poor stars @xcite , and in ba - stars . also fluorine pollution by agb - stars in globular clusters",
    "has been shown by for example @xcite .",
    "when it comes to the production of fluorine by the @xmath0-process , @xcite do not see any evidence for it in the interstellar medium and the fluorine production of w - r stars has been theoretically questioned by .",
    "this means that these two production sites are more speculative at the moment .    to determine the relative role of the three production processes more observations",
    "are needed . however , determining the fluorine abundance is not easy because of a lack of spectral lines in stellar spectra . the hf line at 2.3 @xmath1 m is often used , but it is very weak in dwarfs and metal - poor giants . unfortunately it is situated in a region with a lot of telluric lines adding even more uncertainty to the fluorine abundance determined from this line .",
    "furthermore there have been several sets of molecular data for the hf molecule used in the literature : one from , in turn from tipping and one from @xcite , in turn from sauval , differing in the excitation energy by 0.25 ev . for further details on these line lists ,",
    "see , where a hf line list compatible with the partition function built into many spectral synthesis programs ( for example moog , bsyn , and sme ) was presented .",
    "shortly thereafter @xcite published a version of the hf line list based on einstein @xmath2-values from the hitran2012 database .",
    "these @xmath2-values are very close to the values used in leading to an agreement of the log@xmath3 values within @xmath40.01 dex .",
    "when it comes to fluorine production in the solar neighborhood , as mentioned earlier , and @xcite showed production in agb - stars . argued that the main production site is agb - stars , while @xcite claim that the relative fluorine contribution from agb - stars probably are _ not _ the main source of fluorine in the solar neighborhood , but rather the @xmath0-process .",
    "in line with the modeling of @xcite , who predict that the largest difference in fluorine abundance for a scenario with and without the @xmath0-process can be found in metal - poor stars , @xcite explore metal - poor field giants , and show that neither model fit their observations well .",
    "however , the model closest to the observed values is the one including the @xmath0-process .",
    "obviously the question of the fluorine abundance trend in the solar neighborhood is still open , and there is indeed need for further study .    in this _ letter _ , we reevaluate the chemical evolution of fluorine in the solar neighborhood by comparing current models with newly derived fluorine abundances for seven bright giants using our new line lists , including the hf lines around 12 @xmath1 m , which are here used for the first time . the 12.2 @xmath1 m line used is much stronger than the 2.3 @xmath1 m line and is not affected by telluric lines .",
    "spectra of seven bright , nearby giants in the 12.2 @xmath1 m region were recorded with the spectrometer texes @xcite mounted on irtf on mauna kea during 2000 , 2001 and 2006 .",
    "the spectra were extracted and reduced in a typical manner ( see @xcite for further details ) and have a resolution of @xmath565,000 and a signal - to - noise ratio of typically 100 .",
    "furthermore , we have retrieved four spectra covering the 2.3 @xmath1 m hf line observed with the fts mounted on the kitt peak national observatory mayall 4 m reflector ( one of the four spectra is the ir arcturus atlas by @xcite ) .",
    "these observations were made on june , 24 1977 , august , 24 1983 , and on april , 13 1990 .",
    "for the determinations of metallicity and oxygen abundances , we searched spectral archives for visual spectra of our target stars and found three from the narval spectrometer , one from harps @xcite , and one from elodie .",
    "all spectra were analyzed using the software ` spectroscopy made easy ` , sme and a grid of marcs spherical symmetric lte models .",
    "the stellar parameters used are listed in table [ tab : stars ] .",
    "effective temperatures determined from angular diameter measurements are taken from @xcite , and gravities are determined from the stellar radius @xcite , the parallax , and fits to evolutionary tracks ( see ryde et .",
    "al ( in prep . ) for further description ) .",
    "the [ fe / h ] and the optical microturbulence were , for five of our stars , determined from fe i - lines in visual spectra from the three different spectroscopical archives . for the remaining two stars we could not find any optical spectra , but use literature values for the metallicity , see table [ tab : stars ] . for the ir spectra we ,",
    "as suggested by , instead use a slightly higher value of 2.0 km / s for the microturbulence for all stars .",
    "typical uncertainties of the stellar parameters are @xmath6=50 k , @xmath7=0.1 , @xmath8[fe / h]=0.1 , and @xmath9=0.5 kms@xmath10 .",

    "we have fts k - band spectra where the 2.3 @xmath1 m hf line is unaffected by telluric lines , so for that subset of stars we are able to compare the fluorine abundances as derived from the 12.2 @xmath1 m hf line to the abundances from the 2.3 @xmath1 m line . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first determination of fluorine for all stars presented here except @xmath12boo , which has been extensively studied because of the available atlas of @xcite .",

    "the 2.3 @xmath1 m line is more temperature sensitive than the 12.2 @xmath1 m hf line and , for our sample of stars , the 12.2 @xmath1 m hf line is typically very sensitive to the microturbulence , the reason being that it is on the verge of being saturated for most of our stars ( @xmath23 ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : spectra ] we show the spectra around the 12.2 @xmath1 m hf line for our stars .",
    "we note that the hf - line is blended with a mg i line ( 122051.12  , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 ) , but assuming the atomic data is correct ( it is rated ` b+ ' in the nist database , meaning an uncertainty in the transition probability of @xmath26 ) sme will compensate for this line in the spectral fitting and the fluorine abundance determination .",
    "several water lines are also present in the 12 @xmath1 m region , which will be explored in a forthcoming paper ( ryde et al . in prep ) .",
    "our abundance results are listed in table [ tab : stars ] and plotted in figures [ fig : feh]-[fig : koba ] .",
    "the fluorine abundances as derived from the 2.3 @xmath1 m line and the 12.2 @xmath1 m line are in close agreement for all stars except @xmath12tau where the latter value is @xmath40.2 dex higher than the former .",
    "however , because of the strong microturbulence dependence of the 12.2 @xmath1 m line this is within the uncertainties .",
    "we note that changing the ir microturbulence , within the uncertainty , to 2.5 km / s will shift this value into the trends of the others in the plots .",
    "since the fluorine abundances derived from the 2.3 @xmath1 m and the 12.2 @xmath1 m lines agree so well using standard marcs atmospheres for these red giants , we can conclude that also the formation of the 12 @xmath1 m lines are well described by such models . on the contrary",
    ", numerous water lines in this wavelength region are poorly modelled .",
    "@xcite thus constructed a semi - empirical model atmosphere which could explain the formation of strong water lines .",
    "a cooling of the outer atmosphere of a few 100 k , at @xmath27 , was needed .",
    "this extra outer cooling does , however , not significantly affect the 12.2 @xmath1 m hf line , since it is formed deeper in the photosphere : the derived fluorine abundance is only 0.07 dex higher for @xmath12boo when using a standard marcs model compared to using the modified marcs model of @xcite .",
    "available chemical evolution models of fluorine in the solar neighborhood predict very similar abundance trends . in figures [ fig : feh]-[fig : koba ] we have chosen to compare our results to the chemical evolution models of @xcite since those are the only models to our knowledge showing the evolution of fluorine from production in only agb - stars .",
    "for example the models of @xcite have chemical evolution models of fluorine including ( i ) the @xmath0-process , ( ii ) the @xmath0-process and w - r stars , and ( iii ) @xmath0-process , w - r stars and agb - stars",
    ". since agb - stars are the only source of fluorine that has been observationally proven ( see section [ sec : intro ] ) we find the combinations of chemical models in @xcite to be more appropriate : they have one including fluorine production only in agb - stars and two including fluorine production in agb - stars _ and _ two different @xmath0-process energies .    from the left panel of figure [ fig : feh ] ,",
    "two observations can be made : first , the models _ only _ including the agb star contribution seem to predict the fluorine production compared to iron well within uncertainties , and second , almost all our [ f / fe]-values are slightly sub - solar .",
    "the second observation might suggest that the solar value used ( a(f)@xmath28 taken from @xcite ) is too high or that some other process is present .",
    "we note , however , that taking the large uncertainty of the solar value ( @xmath19(f)@xmath29 ) into account , our observed trend is in good agreement with the solar value . it would be desirable to determine the solar fluorine abundance to a higher accuracy .",
    "however , none of the spectral lines published here or in below 22 @xmath1 m are visible in the photospheric solar atlases of @xcite and @xcite . a general estimation of the line strength by @xmath30 shows that the lines above 22 @xmath1 m will only get weaker , meaning that when determining the solar fluorine abundance spectroscopically , one has to use a spectrum from a sunspot .",
    "large uncertainties like the above are then expected because of the uncertainty of the temperature in , and the modeling of , the sunspot .    from the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : feh ] we see that @xmath12boo ( the most metal - poor star in our sample ) has an oxygen abundance most consistent with it being of thick disk - type ( this is explored in much more detail in @xcite ) . in the left panel",
    "it is indeed slightly better fitted by the thick disk model than the solar neighborhood model , but both models predict higher fluorine than we measure .    in figure [ fig : koba ] , we plot [ f / o ] vs [ o / h ] to exclude the iron dependence and to better distinguish between contributions from sniie and agb - stars , since iron is abundantly produced in type ia sne .",
    "we see that the chemical evolution model only including agb - stars and excluding the @xmath0-process @xcite best reproduce our fluorine and oxygen abundances .",
    "one star , @xmath12boo , falls below the line of the solar neighborhood model , but on the other hand , in this case , it is well reproduced by the thick disk model .",
    "the uncertainties of our data in figure [ fig : koba ] only give room for a @xmath0-process with a neutrino energy much lower than expected @xcite , which corroborates the results of @xcite .",
    "based on the combination of figures [ fig : feh]-[fig : koba ] , our small sample of stars seem to show that only agb - stars are needed to explain the fluorine abundance in the solar neighborhood .",
    "eventhough the agb - star and the @xmath0-process contributions are of similar order in the relatively short metallicity range of our observations @xcite , including both in the models would most likely over - predict the fluorine abundance .",
    "it should , however , be noted that there are certainly uncertainties in these models , and they depend , to different degrees , on uncertain input values .",
    "therefore , to draw firm conclusions , more observations would be needed : ideally more metal - poor stars to even better test the presence or not of the @xmath0-process , and more metal - rich stars to test the possible production of fluorine in w - r stars .",
    "as stated earlier , the 2.3 @xmath1 m hf line becomes too weak in metal - poor stars , but the 12.2 @xmath1 m line , that is strong in our sample of stars , should be well suited to use for abundance determinations as low as [ fe / h]@xmath31 . also further galactic chemical evolution modeling including fluorine production in w - r stars , sneii and agb stars together , in different combinations , and",
    "independently would be helpful in trying to determine the major contributor of fluorine in the solar neighborhood .",
    "we present a new line list , with excitation energies and lines strengths , for n - band hf lines and for the first time use one of them for fluorine abundance determination .",
    "the abundances derived from this line agrees with the abundances derived from the often used 2.3 @xmath1 m line , within uncertainties , for our sample of stars .",
    "thus , our hf lines list for the vibration - rotation lines as presented in and that for the pure rotational lines in the n band presented here , give consistent results .",
    "our measured fluorine - oxygen abundance trend suggests that the fluorine production in agb - stars might be sufficient to explain the fluorine abundance in the solar neighborhood and that the @xmath0-process is not needed .",
    "however , to firmly establish this , more observations are needed .",
    "since the 2.3 @xmath1 m line is very weak in metal - poor stars and the n - band lines are much stronger , these lines can probably help determining the possible significance of the @xmath0-process in the chemical evolution of the solar neighborhood .",
