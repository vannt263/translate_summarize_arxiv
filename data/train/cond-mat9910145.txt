    "second order phase transitions display many interesting and subtle properties associated with scale invariance and universality at critical points . some of these , such as power - law singularities of the free energy and other quantities at the critical point , and their critical exponents and amplitudes , have been studied rather thoroughly ( see , e.  g. , @xcite ) . among less investigated items",
    "are the universal characteristics of finite - size effects .",
    "these are important for analysis of experiments with finite samples , as well as for computer simulations , which necessarily have to deal with finite - size systems .    in clear distinction from , for example",
    ", critical indices , the finite size effects depend crucially on the nature of the statistical ensemble under consideration . to be concrete ,",
    "let us consider one of the standard model systems of the phase transition theory  the three - dimensional ( 3d ) ising model on the simple cubic lattice , with nearest - neighbor interactions .    according to universality",
    ", this model describes the critical properties of a wide range of systems of a different physical nature , including second order phase transitions in uniaxial magnetic systems and the liquid - vapor critical point .",
    "the statistical ensemble most commonly used ( usually denoted as canonical ensemble ) is defined by the partition function @xmath1 where the sum includes all the @xmath2 possible configurations of a total number of @xmath3 spins .",
    "this ensemble is perfectly natural for applications to magnetic phase transitions , where @xmath4 corresponds to physical spin at the lattice site @xmath5 pointing up or down , respectively .",
    "however , in the language of the lattice gas , @xmath4 corresponds to an occupied or unoccupied site , respectively : the total number of particles fluctuates .",
    "the canonical partition sum eq .",
    "( [ zcanon ] ) in the spin language thus corresponds with the grand partition sum in the lattice gas language . to avoid confusion",
    ", we emphasize that in the rest of this paper we are using the word ` canonical ' in the language of the ising model : it means that the magnetization is allowed to fluctuate freely .",
    "in contrast , many real experiments and simulations of liquid - vapor systems are performed with a fixed number of particles . fixing the number of lattice - gas particles is equivalent , in the language of magnetic systems , to fixing the total magnetization @xmath6 of the system , or , in other words , fixing the average magnetization per spin @xmath7 .",
    "thus we will be interested in the properties of the 3d ising model in the fixed - magnetization ensemble , @xmath8 note that the magnetic field @xmath9 is absent ; it can only contribute a constant factor .",
    "one of the main difficulties encountered in computer simulation studies of critical phenomena is the critical - slowing - down phenomenon . for a number of spin models in the canonical ensemble",
    "this problem has been largely overcome with the invention of cluster algorithms @xcite . until recently ,",
    "no similarly useful algorithm has become available for the fixed - magnetization ensemble .",
    "this situation has now changed by the development of a geometric cluster algorithm @xcite .",
    "we have used this algorithm extensively in this work to efficiently simulate systems of fixed magnetization at the critical point .    in the canonical ising model described by eq .",
    "( [ zcanon ] ) , the magnetic field @xmath9 is an adjustable external parameter .",
    "in contrast , the magnetization is a fluctuating observable . for each configuration taken from the ensemble one can sample its magnetization per spin @xmath10 . having accumulated @xmath11 over a sufficiently large set of configurations",
    ", one can construct the probability distribution @xmath12 @xcite , and determine various expectation values such as @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "examples of such probability distributions at the critical point are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    on the other hand , for systems in the fixed - magnetization ensemble described by eq .",
    "( [ zfixedm ] ) , the roles of @xmath9 and @xmath11 are interchanged : now @xmath11 is the adjustable parameter , and it is intuitively clear that there should be some way to define an observable , which we denote by @xmath15 ( to avoid confusion with @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ zcanon ] ) ) , that will correspond to the magnetic field .",
    "thus @xmath15 will be a fluctuating quantity , that can be sampled on a microscopic level from configurations taken from the fixed - magnetization ensemble . in the limit @xmath16 in both ensembles (",
    "such that the correlation length vanishes in comparison with the system size ) , the fluctuations in @xmath11 and @xmath15 become negligible , and the difference between @xmath9 and @xmath15 vanishes .    in section",
    "[ sec : defh ] we discuss the definition of @xmath15 and its properties . in section",
    "[ sec : h - and - p ] we establish the relation between the function @xmath17 in the fixed-@xmath11 ensemble and the probability distribution @xmath12 in the canonical ensemble .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the relation between the function @xmath17 in the fixed-@xmath11 ensemble and the function @xmath18 in the canonical ensemble , and with a summary of our main results .",
    "we will now describe a definition of @xmath17 that is based on statistical analysis of the local environment of a given spin . by local environment",
    "we mean the set of neighbors with which this spin interacts . in our particular case of the ising model with nearest - neighbor interactions on the simple cubic lattice ,",
    "the local environment consists of 6 spins on the neighboring sites .",
    "the local environment has @xmath19 possible configurations which divide in 7 types : 0 + 6@xmath20 ( zero spins up , 6 down ) , 1 + 5@xmath20 , 2 + 4@xmath20 , 3 + 3@xmath20 , 4 + 2@xmath20 , 5 + 1@xmath20 , 6 + 0@xmath20 ( six spins up , zero down ) . the simplest way to monte",
    "carlo sample @xmath17 is on the basis of the symmetric case : 3 + 3@xmath20 @xcite . for every monte carlo configuration , go through all sites , and select all spins with the required 3 + 3@xmath20 local environment",
    "then compute the average @xmath21 of the selected spins , and define @xmath15 by @xmath22 it is also possible to employ , instead of 3 + 3@xmath20 , any other of the 7 types of local environment . in these non - symmetric cases",
    "the definition reads @xmath23 where the @xmath24 are the nearest neighbors of @xmath25 .",
    "one easily notices that the definition is constructed in such a way that @xmath15 corresponds , on the mean field level , to the external field @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ zcanon ] ) .",
    "now it is interesting to see what are the results of monte carlo simulations for @xmath17 .",
    "as has already been demonstrated in @xcite , at the critical temperature @xmath17 practically coincides with the relation @xmath26 in the canonical ensemble as obtained by monte carlo simulations , provided @xmath11 is sufficiently large , so that the correlation length is sufficiently small in comparison with the system size and the finite - size effects are suppressed . at the same time , the striking feature of @xmath17 for not - so - large @xmath11 is its nonmonotonic behavior .",
    "first @xmath17 goes negative at small @xmath11 , then it begins to grow , and finally assumes the usual behavior at larger @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( diamonds ) , which shows monte carlo results obtained by means of the the geometric cluster algorithm @xcite .    in the remaining part of the paper , we will give the explanation of this behavior ( which turns out to be a peculiar kind of finite size effect ) , by establishing a close relation between @xmath17 in the fixed-@xmath11 ensemble , and the probability distribution @xmath12 in the canonical ensemble .",
    "considering the fixed-@xmath11 ensemble , eq .",
    "( [ zfixedm ] ) , one notices that it can be obtained by taking the canonical ensemble ( [ zcanon ] ) , and cutting from it the subset satisfying the constraint , @xmath27 . within this subset we still have the usual boltzmann probabilities @xmath28 for individual configurations .",
    "this makes it possible to establish a relation between @xmath17 in the fixed-@xmath11 ensemble , and the properties of the system in the canonical ensemble . the definition of @xmath17 described in sect .",
    "[ sec : defh ] is equivalent to the following .",
    "let us take the fixed-@xmath11 ensemble and concentrate our attention on one particular lattice site , and on the spin located there .",
    "let us perform the following measurement .",
    "for every configuration consider the local environment of our selected site .",
    "if it is not 3 + 3@xmath20 , do not measure anything for this configuration .",
    "if it is 3 + 3@xmath20 , measure the selected spin @xmath25 and store it .",
    "finally , find @xmath21 , and use eq .",
    "( [ defh33 ] ) to determine @xmath15 .",
    "one notices that , as long as we are performing a thought experiment , we need not care about the monte carlo statistics",
    ". we can just stick to one site and get the same @xmath21 without averaging over all sites , because they are equivalent .",
    "up to now we have distinguished between 7 types of local environments , such as 3 + 3@xmath20 .",
    "let us go a bit further and treat separately all @xmath29 possible local environments .",
    "in other words , the measurement of @xmath21 is now performed in an even smaller subset of the fixed-@xmath11 ensemble : also the six spins forming the local environment of @xmath25 are fixed . in the case",
    "that the predetermined local environment is of the 3 + 3@xmath20 type , it may seem that there is no interaction between @xmath25 and the remaining system of @xmath30 spins . nevertheless , the fixed-@xmath11 ensemble probabilities that @xmath25 is @xmath31 or @xmath32 , which we denote , respectively , by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , are not equal in general .",
    "these probabilities may still depend on the magnetization of the remaining system , which is coupled to @xmath25 by the overall magnetization constraint : @xmath35 the total magnetization of the system is thus expressed as the sum of three terms : the local spin @xmath25 , the sum of its six neighbors and the magnetization of the remaining @xmath30 spins denoted as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 stand for `` remaining system '' .",
    "the conditional probabilities @xmath38 can be more explicitly written as @xmath39 the two conditional arguments specify the total magnetization @xmath40 and the states of the 6 neighbor spins .",
    "we now make the connection with the canonical probabilities @xmath41 which include the magnetization as an unconditional argument .",
    "we use the zero - field canonical probabilities i.e. , @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ zcanon ] ) .",
    "@xmath43 we may slightly rewrite this by substitution of the probability @xmath41 by @xmath44 which is equal but uses the magnetization of the @xmath30 remaining spins as its second argument : @xmath45 let us first consider the simplest case @xmath46 .",
    "thus the canonical probability @xmath44 does not depend on its first argument , which can thus be skipped : @xmath47 therefore , @xmath48 the condition @xmath49 in effect introduces a defect in the remaining system : an octahedron - shaped bubble with six spins at its vertices fixed , while the spin @xmath25 in the middle is decoupled and plays no role any more .",
    "obviously , the ratio ( [ p+over_p- ] ) could be obtained by performing a usual canonical ensemble simulation of such a system with a defect , and measuring the probability distribution for its overall magnetization @xmath36 .",
    "the value of the ratio ( [ p+over_p- ] ) would then be given by the ratio of the heights of the two neighboring bins in the corresponding histogram .    in all cases of practical interest for the study of the scaling limit ( sufficiently large systems , sufficiently small magnetization )",
    "the ratio ( [ p+over_p- ] ) is close to 1 .",
    "otherwise a difference of one unit in the total magnetization would lead to a large change of probability : this would obviously be far from the scaling limit .",
    "thus we always work with @xmath50 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a shorter notation @xmath51 where @xmath52 may be read as the magnetization of the remaining system if the factor @xmath3 instead of @xmath30 makes a negligible difference , i.e. for large systems .",
    "we have to keep in mind that the notation @xmath53 refers to a system with a defect whose type is not explicitly shown . again restricting ourselves to local environments of the type 3 + 3@xmath20",
    ", we obtain @xmath54 thus we arrive at @xmath55 also , due to @xmath50 , eq .  ( [ defh33 ] ) reduces to @xmath56 and we get @xmath57 defining the effective potential @xmath58 ( i.e. , the ginzburg ",
    "landau fixed-@xmath11 free energy ) of the present system ( with defect ) by @xmath59 we get immediately @xmath60 for large systems , the relative contribution of the defect is small , and thus @xmath17 is well approximated by @xmath61 for the finite system _ without _ a defect : @xmath62 @xmath63 where the ellipsis stands for corrections vanishing at large @xmath3 .    as is well known , for finite 3d ising models in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions , the distribution @xmath12 has a double - peak structure @xcite at the critical point .",
    "thus @xmath61 has a double - well shape , which immediately explains why @xmath15 goes negative for small values of @xmath11 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the quantitative comparison of @xmath17 ( depicted by diamonds ) and @xmath64 ( solid line ) .",
    "one observes that the correspondence between the points and the line clearly improves with increasing lattice size . to extract @xmath65 from the monte - carlo - generated @xmath12 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) we have exploited the fact , reported in @xcite , that for the system under consideration , @xmath12 can be well approximated by the ansatz @xmath66 which applies to the finite - size regime , i.e. the finite size is small compared to the bulk correlation length .",
    "we have fitted the monte carlo generated @xmath12 data accordingly , determined the parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and thus obtained @xmath69 in a simple polynomial form .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the shape of @xmath12 for a given geometry ( in our case , a cubic box with periodic boundaries ) is universal at the critical point .",
    "that is , the parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 have well - defined scaling limits when the system size grows to infinity .",
    "these values , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , have been determined in @xcite by making use of a special model in the 3d ising universality class , which has almost no corrections to scaling @xcite .",
    "the corresponding scaling form of @xmath69 is plotted by the dashed line in fig .",
    "one observes that deviations from scaling ( between the solid and the dashed lines ) go down with increasing size , as they should .    the results in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] confirm the relation between the observable @xmath17 as defined above in the fixed-@xmath11 ensemble , and the probability distribution @xmath12 in the canonical ensemble .",
    "the remaining discrepancy ( between the diamonds and the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) is due to the `` defect '' discussed above .",
    "the question arises whether it is possible to modify our definition of @xmath15 in order to suppress this discrepancy .",
    "we have found that this is indeed the case . up to this point , we restricted ourselves to symmetric local environments ( 3 + 3@xmath20 ) to define @xmath15 via eq .",
    "( [ defh33 ] ) . as has already been mentioned , using eq .",
    "( [ defh ] ) one may use other types of local environments as well . in those cases",
    "the magnetization @xmath72 enters the definition : @xmath73 following the same arguments as before , we decompose the system in the local spin @xmath25 , its fixed neighbors , and the remaining system ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "this leads to the following generalization of eq .",
    "( [ rs1 ] ) : @xmath74 thus we arrive once again at eqs .",
    "( [ lnp_rs]-[dv_rs ] ) .",
    "but we now have a different type of defect in the remaining system , and a shift of @xmath75 in the magnetization of the remaining system ; we neglect the latter effect .",
    "now it seems plausible that one can suppress the influence of the defect by averaging over all configurations of the defect , weighted with their natural occurrence probabilities .",
    "such an averaging should more faithfully reproduce the characteristics of a system _ without _ a defect .",
    "the modified determination of @xmath15 is as follows .",
    "sample configurations from the fixed-@xmath11 ensemble . for each spin determine its orientation ( @xmath76 or @xmath20 ) and the type of its local environment ( type 0 ,  , 6 for 0 + 6@xmath20 ,  , 6 + 0@xmath20 ) .",
    "accumulate these data by incrementing one out of 14 bins @xmath77 , @xmath78 , where @xmath79 denotes the type of local environment , and @xmath76 or @xmath20 denotes the local spin .",
    "the resulting population numbers satisfy @xmath80",
    ". then , for each @xmath81 , find @xmath82 and compute @xmath83 according to eq .",
    "( [ defh ] ) .",
    "finally , @xmath84 applying this definition to our simulation data , we observe that , within the statistical accuracy , the discrepancy between @xmath17 and @xmath69 is indeed eliminated ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the relation ( [ hveff ] ) looks exactly the same as the standard relation between the field and magnetization in the canonical ensemble : @xmath85 the observed differences between the properties of @xmath17 in the fixed-@xmath11 ensemble and @xmath26 in the canonical ensemble , the most prominent of which is the nonmonotonic behavior of @xmath17 instead of the monotonic behavior of @xmath26 , can be traced to the different definitions of the effective potential .",
    "the one that occurs in eq .",
    "( [ hveff ] ) is the fixed-@xmath11 free energy , @xmath86 while the one that enters eq .",
    "( [ hveff_canon ] ) is defined via a legendre transformation : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the canonical average of the magnetization in an external field @xmath9 .",
    "the partition functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 were defined in section [ sec : intr ] . in a situation where fluctuations become negligible ,",
    "the term @xmath91 in @xmath92 cancels the field dependence of the boltzmann weights .",
    "then both definitions of the effective potential become equivalent , and both effective potentials approach the bulk form so that the difference between @xmath9 and @xmath15 vanishes .      returning to eq .",
    "( [ dv_rs ] ) , there is another finite - size effect : the difference between @xmath58 and @xmath61 due to the presence of the defect .",
    "the relative contribution of the defect becomes small for large systems , and it is further suppressed by the improved definition of @xmath15 , eq .",
    "( [ h_impr ] ) .",
    "thus for large systems and sufficiently high @xmath11 , when the correlation length is small in comparison with the system size , the finite size effects are suppressed , the difference between @xmath61 and the bulk effective potential disappears , and our definition of @xmath17 reproduces the expected bulk behavior .    in conclusion , we have studied the critical three - dimensional ising model in the fixed - magnetization ensemble , in a cubic geometry with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this was done by means of the recently developed geometric cluster monte carlo algorithm .",
    "we have defined a magnetic field - like observable @xmath15 for this ensemble , studied its dependence on the magnetization @xmath11 and explained its counter - intuitive nonmonotonic behavior : @xmath15 first becomes negative and then positive with increasing @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we have provided a quantitative description of @xmath17 by establishing a close relation with @xmath12  the probability distribution of the magnetization in the canonical ensemble .",
    "the nonmonotonic behavior of @xmath17 can be understood as a manifestation of the same finite - size effect that is responsible for the double - peak shape of @xmath12 at the critical point .",
    "furthermore we have shown that , when fluctuations are negligible , our definition reduces to the standard canonical relation @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we note that in the different context of the simulation of a system of particles whose number is fixed , a similar line of reasoning enables the determination of the chemical potential of the particles @xcite .",
