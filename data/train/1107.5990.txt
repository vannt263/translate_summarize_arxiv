    "since their prediction by lethokov @xcite , random lasers have been the subject of numerous studies .",
    "contrary to conventional lasers , they have no cavity like a fabry - prot resonator or a ring cavity . instead",
    ", they are made of a scattering random medium like a semiconductor powder or a suspension of scattering particles in a laser dye , and are excited by an external pump which introduces gain .",
    "multiple scattering of light in the random medium provides optical feedback .",
    "an important feature of random lasers is that they are open systems , typically with strong leakage .",
    "because of these unusual features , there was a several years debate about the nature of random lasing .",
    "random lasing has been described as light diffusion with gain @xcite , or in terms of well - localized modes inside the scattering medium @xcite , or by random walks of photons along exceptionally long paths @xcite .",
    "such approaches suffered from different drawbacks . on the one hand , the diffusion equation approach and the random walk of photons do not take into account the wave aspect of light propagation , thus neglecting the part played by interference . on the other hand , experimental characterization of the scattering media which exhibited random lasing in the presence of gain showed that they were far from the localization regime , thus making the occurrence of well - localized modes unlikely .",
    "recently , important progress has been made in theoretical and numerical studies by recognizing that even the bad resonances of leaky systems play a role in random lasing , similar to the part played by cavity modes of a conventional laser @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown @xcite that the first lasing mode at threshold is not strictly identical but very close to a resonance , or quasimode , of the passive system . despite the complex nature of these quasimodes , the understanding of random lasing",
    "is therefore greatly simplified in the single mode regime , just above threshold . as the pumping rate is increased ,",
    "however , nonlinear effects come into play",
    ". these effects might be even more pronounced in weakly scattering active media where high external pumping is required to compensate for strong loss .",
    "this is particularly true in the multimode regime above the lasing threshold , with the onset of competition between different lasing modes .",
    "detailed investigations of the multimode regime in random lasers are scarce @xcite . the background of standard laser physics is not directly transposable to random lasers , where the complexity of the spatial and spectral properties of random lasers need to be taken into account .",
    "the recent steady - state _ ab initio _ laser theory ( salt ) @xcite , which considers the openness of novel laser systems , such as random lasers , is the first theory to give predictions about nonlinear phenomena and mode interaction @xcite .",
    "this theory relies , however , on several assumptions .",
    "in particular , it assumes the existence of a steady - state multiperiodic solution of the laser field , population inversion and polarization of the atomic medium .",
    "however , the full nonlinear dynamics certainly play a role in determining behavior in such complex and highly nonlinear media . including them would not only bring a more complete theoretical approach , but also bring theory closer to experiment .    in this paper",
    ", we numerically investigate the full dynamics of one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) random lasers using steady external pumping by progressively increasing the external pump intensity .",
    "we report several manifestations of optical nonlinearities , both in the single mode and multimode regime , in the steady state as well as in the transient regime",
    ". strong relaxation oscillations , mode competition and mode suppression are reported in the transient regime , which reveal the complexity of the laser dynamics in random lasers .",
    "third - harmonic generation , four - wave mixing and sum - frequency generation are observed , which have never been reported before . above the so - called second threshold @xcite",
    ", the steady state becomes unstable .",
    "a coherent instability manifests itself as temporal oscillations of the field intensity , atomic population inversion and medium polarization .",
    "this issue has been addressed in a different paper @xcite and will not be discussed here , although it is another manifestation of the nonlinear dynamics expected in random lasers . if these effects are not new , their observation in random lasers is interesting since they not only challenge the theoretical understanding of these systems but they are more pronounced than in conventional lasers . our effort here is to stress how these observations are related to the particular nature of the modes of random lasers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : model ] describes the 1d and 2d random structures that have been studied and the numerical methods that have been used .",
    "section [ sec : competition ] shows nonlinear effects like the build - up of laser oscillation and interactions between lasing modes , which include mode competition and nonlinear wave - mixing .",
    "conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "the background medium of index 1 has been chosen as the active part of the system .",
    "two different methods have been used to study lasing in 1d systems .",
    "first , it is possible to employ the transfer matrix ( tm ) method similar to that used in @xcite .",
    "however , this is a frequency - domain method , which can not describe transient behavior in the time domain and mode competition in the multimode regime .",
    "for this reason , we also solve maxwell s equations using the finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method @xcite .",
    "the two methods can be compared easily @xcite , yet bring different advantages . in this case , the gain medium in fdtd is modeled by a four - level atomic system @xcite .    in 2d systems , we only use the fdtd method to solve maxwell s equations and consider the case of transverse magnetic polarization .",
    "we use perfectly matched layer ( cpml ) absorbing boundaries @xcite to approximate open boundary conditions .",
    "gain in the system is again introduced by coupling maxwell s equations with the population equations of a four - level atomic system .",
    "the corresponding equations are given in appendix [ app : mectpe ] .",
    "population inversion between the levels corresponding to the laser transition is created by an external pump which transfers atoms from the ground state ( level 1 ) to the upper level ( level 4 ) of the four - level atomic system . in the calculations presented in the paper ,",
    "the control parameter is the pumping rate @xmath27 of atoms from the ground state to the upper level .",
    "our results here are devoted to random laser modes above threshold and to their interactions in the multimode regime .",
    "we not only discuss the final stationary state but also the transient build - up of the laser field . in both situations ,",
    "we observe noticeable mode competition .",
    "the large gain which must be introduced in order to counterbalance the large loss of the system leads to a significant evolution of the lasing modes as a function of the pumping rate .",
    "this effect is much larger than its counterpart in conventional lasers .",
    "finally , mode interaction reveals itself by the systematic observation of nonlinear wave - mixing , which appears as soon as multiple lasing modes coexist .",
    "each fdtd calculation of a given random system with a fixed value of the pumping rate @xmath27 starts in the same way .",
    "first , the initial atomic populations are set at the stationary values in absence of stimulated emission , i.e. , for @xmath28 ( appendix [ app : mectpe ] ) . at the initial time @xmath29 ,",
    "a small - intensity broadband light pulse is launched in the system .",
    "since there is no spontaneous emission in our model , this short pulse , which propagates and is scattered by the particles of the system , provides the non - zero initial field necessary for lasing action to begin .",
    "if @xmath27 is larger than the threshold value , the laser field builds up in the system until it reaches a value where the population inversion starts to be depleted by increasing stimulated emission .",
    "the steady - state regime is reached when the value of the population inversion density corresponds to the gain , which exactly compensates the loss through the open boundaries of the system .",
    "this is the standard behavior of any laser oscillator .",
    "( color online ) relaxation oscillations in ( a ) population inversion and ( b ) intensity , for @xmath30 ( solid black line ) to @xmath31 ( dotted red line ) where single - mode lasing occurs .",

    "the intensity and oscillation frequency increases with @xmath27 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",height=158 ]    however , random lasers are open systems usually with short `` cavity '' lifetimes , i.e. , shorter than the atomic lifetime @xmath32 .",
    "this is the well - known condition @xcite for the occurrence of relaxation oscillations or spiking , i.e. , temporal oscillations of the field and of the population inversion before the laser oscillation converges to a steady state .",
    "an example is given in figure [ fig : fig2 ] where relaxation oscillations are seen in the population inversion and laser intensity for a 1d random laser .",
    "as the pumping rate increases , the intensity and the frequency of the relaxation oscillations increase .",
    "indeed , relaxation oscillations in random lasers have been reported by several groups @xcite and we have systematically observed them in our simulations thus stressing the importance of the openness of such systems .      as mentioned earlier , even the bad resonances of open random systems play a role in lasing similar to the part played by the cavity modes of a conventional laser . in particular , the first lasing mode at threshold is not strictly identical but very close to a resonance or a quasimode of the passive system , a result which was established only recently for random lasers @xcite .",
    "however , this conclusion relies on several conditions that are not always fulfilled in real experiments , for instance , uniform pumping of the total system . in real random lasers",
    ", pumping takes place in the active elements , which usually do not fill up the total volume , such as particles suspended in laser dye where there is no gain in the particles .",

    "previous investigation of partial pumping in random lasers @xcite has already demonstrated that lasing modes can become very different from quasimodes of the passive system . here",
    ", we are in an intermediate situation where gain is not placed everywhere but homogeneously distributed across the system .",
    "the impact of partial gain varies from mode to mode , as shown by the reduced @xmath38 values for the second lasing modes .",

    "the threshold for the second lasing mode is larger , which results in a larger modification of the medium susceptibility due to the gain and further modifies the lasing mode .",
    "the large alteration of the medium susceptibility due to the intense pumping that is required to achieve lasing is again a particular feature of random lasers due to their openness and associated strong leakage . for comparison",

    "we confirm these predictions here .",
