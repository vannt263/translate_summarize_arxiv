    "the ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collision programs at rhic and lhc have been utilized to the produce extreme conditions to create and study the strongly interacting quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , a deconfined state of quarks and gluons .",
    "one of the observables to probe the properties of the hot qcd matter is the azimuthal anisotropy in the momentum distribution of the produced particles .",
    "the anisotropic flow coefficient @xmath7 is generally defined through a fourier decomposition of the emitted particle distribution as a function of the azimuthal angle @xmath8 , @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath11 is the @xmath12-th order anisotropic flow harmonics and @xmath13 is the symmetry plane angle .",
    "recently , the correlations between different order @xmath14 and @xmath15 have been investigated both theoretically and experimentally , which not only focus on the correlations of the orientations of different flow - vector @xmath13  @xcite but also on the correlations of the magnitudes of different flow - vector @xmath11  @xcite .    in this proceeding",
    ", we will briefly review our recent investigations on the correlations of flow harmonics in 2.76a tev pb ",
    "pb collisions using the event - by - event viscous hydrodynamics vish2 + 1 with different initial conditions and the qgp shear viscosity  @xcite .",
    "the vish2 + 1 is a ( 2 + 1)-d viscous hydrodynamic model to describe the fluid expansion of the qgp with longitudinal boost - invariance  @xcite . in the following calculations , we use an equation of state ( eos ) s95p - pce  @xcite , which matches the partially chemical equilibrium hadron resonance gas at low temperature and the lattice qcd data at high temperature .",
    "three different initial conditions , mc - glauber , mc - kln  @xcite , and ampt  @xcite , are used in our calculations to study the influence of initial conditions on the correlations of flow harmonics . to explore the sensitivity of the qgp shear viscosity",
    ", we choose two values of the specific shear viscosity @xmath16 for each initial condition . more specifically , @xmath17 0.08 and 0.20 , for the mc - glauber and mc - kln initial conditions , and @xmath170.08 and 0.16 for the ampt initial conditions .",
    "the hydrodynamic output is converted to final hadron distributions along the freeze - out surface at the temperature @xmath18 = 120 mev via the cooper - frye prescription  @xcite .",
    "the initial time of hydrodynamic evolution @xmath19 and the normalization factors of initial entropy density profiles have been tuned to fit the 0 - 5% centrality data of @xmath20 and @xmath21 spectra of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "the bulk viscosity , net baryon density , and the heat conductivity are set to zero to simplify the calculations .",
    "we firstly calculate the symmetric cumulants @xmath0 defined as @xmath25 .",
    "the upper panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : scvmvn1 ] ( left ) show the comparison between our calculations and the alice measurements .",
    "we find that , for these initial conditions and different values of @xmath16 , vish2 + 1 calculations qualitatively capture the centrality dependence of the flow correlations , but not quantitatively .",
    "specially , even though vish2 + 1 with ampt initial conditions gives good descriptions for the integrated flow @xmath11 ( @xmath26 )  @xcite , it can only reproduce the typical features of the correlations of flow harmonics .",
    "this indicates that the correlations between different flow harmonics are more sensitive to the details of hydrodynamic calculations than the individual @xmath11 coefficients alone .",
    "similar to the alice data , our model gives negative @xmath27 and positive @xmath28 , which suggests @xmath29 and @xmath30 are anti - correlated , while @xmath29 and @xmath31 are correlated .",
    "the results reveal that , for a given event , the case with an elliptic flow @xmath2 larger than the averaged @xmath32 enhances the probability of finding a triangular flow @xmath5 smaller than the averaged @xmath33 and the probability of finding a quadrangular flow @xmath3 larger than the averaged @xmath34 .",
    "the strengths of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are more suppressed with larger @xmath16 for each initial condition , which suggests that both @xmath27 and @xmath28 are strongly influenced by the qgp viscosity . by comparing with the symmetric cumulants of the initial state , @xmath35",
    ", we observe the signs of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are determined by the signs of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : scvmvn1 ] ( right ) presents our predictions for the centrality dependent @xmath0 with @xmath38 ( 5 , 2 ) , ( 5 , 3 ) , and ( 4 , 3 ) , together with their corresponding correlators @xmath35 from the initial state .",
    "we observe that , for each initial condition , the vish2 + 1 gives positive values for @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and negative values for @xmath41 .",
    "this reveals @xmath2 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 are correlated , while @xmath5 and @xmath3 are anti - correlated .",
    "we also notice that their correlation strengths become weaker with the increase of @xmath16 .",
    "the signs of @xmath39 and @xmath40 are consistent with their initial state correlators @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "however , @xmath41 and @xmath37 show opposite signs for the mc - glauber and ampt initial conditions .",
    "this can be well understood from the proposed relationship of @xmath44  @xcite , where the @xmath45 term makes the dominant contributions in non - central collisions  @xcite . as a result",
    ", the signs of @xmath41 are affected by the correlation between @xmath46 and @xmath47 and the correlation between @xmath47 and @xmath48 rather than the correlation between @xmath47 and @xmath48 alone .",
    "figure  [ fig : scrvmvn ] shows the normalized correlator of flow harmonics and initial eccentricity coefficients , which are defined as @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "we find that @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 are sensitive to both initial conditions and @xmath16 .",
    "meanwhile , their corresponding @xmath54 correlator are separated for different initial conditions .",
    "compared to the alice data  @xcite , the calculated @xmath51 are roughly fit the data for ampt initial conditions and @xmath55 and for mc - glauber initial conditions and @xmath56 .",
    "this indicates the normalized symmetric cumulants can be used to constrain the qgp viscosity for different initial conditions .",
    "the @xmath6 from different combinations of initial conditions and @xmath16 are all roughly fit the alice data , which also roughly overlap with each other .",
    "such @xmath16 independent character of @xmath6 can be naturally understood from the widely accepted results @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the proportion coefficients .",
    "meanwhile , the @xmath61 from the three initial conditions used in our calculations also almost overlap from central to semi - central collisions . in contract , panels ( h ) and ( j ) show that , although the @xmath62 strongly depends on the initial conditions , the @xmath63 almost overlap , which is insensitive to the initial conditions used in our calculation .",
    "in summary , we investigated the correlations between flow harmonics in 2.76a tev pb ",
    "pb collisions using the event - by - event viscous hydrodynamics vish2 + 1 with mc - glauber , mc - kln , and ampt initial conditions .",
    "we found the symmetric cumulants @xmath0 are sensitive to both initial conditions and the qgp shear viscosity , the normalized symmetric cumulants @xmath6 are mainly determined by the correlation in the initial state , which are insensitive to the qgp viscocity . in contrast , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 are sensitive to both initial conditions and @xmath16 .",
    "we found that the correlations of flow harmonics are more sensitive to the details of theoretical calculations than individual flow harmonics , which could be used for further constraint the properties of the qgp .",
