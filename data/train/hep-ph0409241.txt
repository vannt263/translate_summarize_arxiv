    "supersymmetry offers many possibilities to describe the observed neutrino data .",
    "the most popular one is certainly the usual seesaw mechanism , which introduces heavy right - handed neutrinos carrying a @xmath4 lepton number violating majorana mass .",
    "however , there also exists one interesting option which is intrinsically supersymmetric , namely , breaking of r - parity .",
    "the breaking of r - parity can be realized by introducing explicit r - parity breaking terms @xcite or by a spontaneous break - down of lepton number @xcite .",
    "the first class of models can be obtained in msugra scenarios where depending on the choice of discrete symmetries various combinations of r - parity violating parameters are present at the gut or planck scale @xcite .",
    "the latter class of models leads after electroweak symmetry breaking to effective terms , the so - called bilinear terms , which are a sub - class of the terms present in the models with explicit r - parity breaking .",
    "these bilinear terms have an interesting feature : they do not introduce trilinear terms when evolved from one scale to another with renormalization group equations ( rges ) .",
    "in contrast , trilinear terms do generate bilinear terms when evolved from one scale to another .",
    "and @xmath5 identically vanish at this scale .",
    "however , this is phenomenologically unacceptable . ]",
    "thus , from the model - building point of view it is an interesting question whether there are observables which are sensitive to the presence / absence of the different terms . in this letter",
    "we tackle this question in scenarios where the sneutrinos are the lightest supersymmetric particles ( lsps ) taking the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) augmented with bilinear and trilinear lepton - number and hence r - parity violating couplings as a reference model .",
    "one might ask , if there are high - scale models which lead to such scenarios . in msugra motivated scenarios",
    "one usually finds that either the lightest neutralino or the right stau is the lsp . in the case of msugra with r - parity violation",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that sneutrinos can be the lsp provided the r - parity violating parameters follow some specific structures and are sufficiently large .",
    "also in models with conserved r - parity there are some regions in the msugra parameter space where the sneutrinos can be lsps .",
    "however , these scenarios imply @xmath6 and small @xmath7 and are , thus , excluded by lep and tevatron data @xcite .",
    "it is probably this theoretical prejudice why the possibility of sneutrinos being lsps has been largely ignored .",
    "however , many models which depart from strict msugra in one way or another can be found in the literature .",
    "just to mention a few representative examples , there are string inspired models where supersymmetry breaking is triggered not only by the dilaton fields but also by moduli fields @xcite . in @xmath8 or @xmath9 models ,",
    "where all neutral gauge bosons , except those forming @xmath10 and @xmath11 , have masses of the order of @xmath12 one expects additional d - term contributions to the sfermion mass parameters at @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming non - universal values of @xmath13 for left sleptons , right sleptons , left squarks and right squarks .",
    "thus sneutrinos can easily be the lsps in these models . in the following",
    "we will take the general mssm at the electroweak scale as a model as we do not want to rely on specific features of a particular high scale model .",
    "it has been shown that in models where r - parity violation is the source of neutrino masses and mixings the decay properties of the lsp are correlated to neutrino properties @xcite . in this letter",
    "we will work out some general features of these correlations for sneutrinos and we will discuss how they depend on the dominance of various couplings , either bilinear or trilinear r - parity violating couplings .",
    "the scenarios we consider are : ( i ) a scenario where the contributions to the neutrino mass matrix are dominated by bilinear terms , ( ii ) a scenario where bilinear terms and trilinear terms are of equal importance and ( iii ) a scenario where trilinear couplings give the dominant contributions to neutrino masses .",
    "limits on sneutrinos decaying through r - parity violating operators have been published by all lep collaborations @xcite with similar results .",
    "limits found for sneutrino lsps range from approximately @xmath14 gev for the different sneutrino flavours and different analyses . in ref .",
    "@xcite larger mass limits up to @xmath15 gev have been reported considering single sneutrino production in an s - channel resonance in @xmath16 collisions @xcite . however , these limits are irrelevant for us because they apply only for large sneutrino widths . in our case",
    "we find sneutrino widths of the order of ev .",

    "therefore we are back to 39 independent parameters relevant for neutrino physics in the most general case .",

    "( [ eq : rpvpot ] ) , for an analytical understanding of our results it is very useful to define an `` @xmath29-less '' basis using the following transformation .",

    "assuming an integrated luminosity of 1  ab@xmath70 this implies that at least @xmath71 sneutrino pairs are produced directly .",
    "the sneutrino has the following decay modes @xmath72 where the hadronic final states contain in general @xmath73-type quarks .",
    "as we will see below , measurable relations to neutrino mixing angles can be obtained mainly by considering final states with charged leptons . since one expects sneutrinos of different flavours to be nearly mass",
    "degenerate it will probably not be possible to decide which sneutrino flavour has been produced in the direct production . as has been shown in @xcite the sharpest correlations between sneutrino decay properties and neutrino mixing angles are obtained if the sneutrino flavour is known .",
    "therefore we propose to study sneutrinos stemming from chargino decays @xmath74 and use the additional lepton as a flavour tag .",
    "clearly one has to be careful not to confuse this lepton with the leptons stemming from the sneutrino decays . to minimize the combinatorial background one has to know the sneutrino and chargino masses . at an lc",
    "this information can be obtained via threshold scans . at the lhc",
    "one can in principal proceed in the following way to obtain the necessary information : ( i ) take the data sample containing only two leptons as they will contain events stemming from the pair production of @xmath75 where @xmath75 decays according to @xmath76 this sample now contains events where only one of the sneutrinos decays into charged leptons and the second one into either neutrinos or jets .",
    "( ii ) the chargino mass can be obtained by a suitable adjustment of the so - called edge variables discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite which are obtained by studying invariant momentum spectra of leptons and quarks .",
    "interesting decay chains are for example those containing @xmath77 here one should first consider events containing three charged leptons , which occurs for example if one of the @xmath78 decays according to the chain in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chainl ] ) and the second one according to the chain in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chainr ] ) .",
    "clearly one has in this case a combinatorial background which has two sources : ( i ) the sneutrino from the chargino decay decays hadronically or invisible and the second one into charged leptons and ( ii ) the pairing of the charged leptons with the same charge is incorrect . in the latter case a study of the kinematics shows that there is exactly one kinematical situation in the rest frame of the chargino where this is possible , namely if the angle @xmath79 between the leptons with the same charge fulfills the following relation : @xmath80 the condition @xmath81 requires @xmath82 . for larger ratios no confusion is possible because the lepton stemming from the chargino has much less energy than the one from the sneutrino decay .    in case of four and more leptons in the event , which have to be analyzed for example in scenarios where the sneutrinos decay mainly into charged leptons , more kinematical configurations exists where a confusion of the various leptons is possible .",
    "a principle way to minimize the combinatorial background is to take out the events with these special kinematical configurations .",
    "it is clear that this type of analysis is an experimental challenge .",
    "detailed monte carlo studies will be necessary to determine the impact of the experimental environments of future lhc and @xmath17 collider experiments on these considerations .",
    "we want to note , that in scenarios , where sneutrinos are the lsps , the left charged sleptons are not much heavier as the mass difference is roughly given by : @xmath83 .",
    "the left sleptons decay in these scenarios either via three body decays , which conserve r - parity , into @xcite @xmath84 or via r - parity violating couplings into @xmath85 the latter decay modes give in principal rise to additional observables correlated with neutrino physics . however , we have found that for mass differences larger than @xmath8610 gev the three body decays clearly dominate .",
    "therefore this additional information is only available if either @xmath7 is small and/or if all particles have masses above @xmath87  gev .    at the lhc @xcite as well as at a @xmath17 machine",
    "@xcite it is possible to produce sneutrinos in s - channel reactions if r - parity is violated .",
    "assuming that all r - parity violating couplings are at most as large as the largest one compatible with neutrino physics it turns out that these processes are strongly suppressed .",
    "we therefore neglect them in the following considerations .",
    "however , if there is an anti - hierarchical structure present in the trilinear couplings allowing e.g.  for large @xmath88 and/or @xmath89 couplings this would lead to additional statistics as well as to additional interesting information .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of the numerical results . in all the following studies we first created a set of supersymmetric spectra in which sneutrinos are the lsps . instead of resorting to some specific supersymmetry breaking scheme ,",
    "this is simply achieved by taking the sneutrino mass as a free parameter , as discussed above . after selecting sneutrino masses to obey the lep bounds @xcite we add r - parity violating parameters taking into account constraints from neutrino physics .",
    "these are @xmath90 and @xmath91 , the atmospheric mass squared difference and mixing angle , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , the solar mass squared difference and mixing angle , as well as the upper limit on @xmath94 , the reactor angle .",
    "different assumptions as to which of the r - parity breaking parameters give the dominant contributions to the neutrino mass matrix give different decay patterns of the sneutrinos , which we will now discuss in turn .",
    "the scenarios we consider are : ( i ) a scenario where the contributions to the neutrino mass matrix are dominated by bilinear terms , ( ii ) a scenario where bilinear terms and trilinear terms are of equal importance and ( iii ) a scenario where trilinear couplings give the dominant contributions to neutrino masses .",
    "one should keep in mind here that neutrino physics does not fix all of the r - parity violating parameters and , thus , there will be several sneutrino decay channels which are not directly related to neutrino physics .",
    "the main assumption in the discussion below is that those decays related to neutrino physics have a branching ratio in the order of at least per - mille .",
    "moreover , we will assume that the flavour of sneutrinos has been tagged with the help of the additional lepton in the chargino decay .",
    "in addition , we note that all r - parity parameters discussed below are given in the `` @xmath29-less '' basis discussed in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "this scenario has been discussed previously briefly in @xcite . here",
    "we assume that the atmospheric mass scale and angle is dominated by the tree - level contribution to the mass matrix , whereas the solar mass scale is induced by loops .",
    "in this scenario the trilinear couplings of the sneutrinos to down quarks and charged leptons follow a hierarchy dictated by the standard model quark and charged lepton masses , see eqs ( [ efflamp ] ) and ( [ efflam ] ) . with this observation and the help of eqs ( [ eq : meff ] ) and ( [ eq : triloopmass ] ) the relative size of all sneutrino couplings",

    "we have calculated the decay properties of sneutrinos assuming that they are the lightest supersymmetric particles in general r - parity violating models .",
    "the decay properties can be used to get information of the relative importance of bilinear r - parity breaking couplings versus trilinear r - parity breaking couplings which is quite interesting from the model building point of view .",
    "we have seen that in the case of bilinear dominance two important features occur : ( i ) the existence of the invisible decay mode @xmath156 with a branching ratio of the order @xmath157 and ( ii ) the visible decay modes are governed by the lepton and down - quark yukawa couplings with the dominant mode into @xmath158 followed by @xmath159 . in the case that trilinear terms become important both features are changed as we have shown .",
    "let us briefly comment on differences in the phenomenology between neutralino lsp , the most commonly studied lsp candidate , and sneutrino lsps at future collider experiments such as lhc or a prospective ilc in scenarios where r - parity is broken by lepton number breaking terms .",
    "the most striking difference is that sneutrino lsps decay nearly to 100% visible states with hardly any missing energy whereas the neutralino has several final states containing neutrinos .",
    "this implies that in the scenarios discussed here there are several decay chains relevant for lhc which do not contain any missing energy , e.g.  @xmath160 which clearly affects the strategies to identify the particles as well as the determination of the underlying model parameters . however , decay chains containing a neutralino still lead to the missing energy signature in such cases due the the decay @xmath161 , which , depending on the mass difference @xmath162 , still can be sizable .",
    "moreover , we have shown that despite the large number of parameters certain ratios of branching ratios of sneutrino decays can be used to devise consistency checks with neutrino physics in all scenarios considered . to accomplish this",
    "we have proposed to flavour tack the sneutrinos in chargino decays as this substantially increases the possibilities to perform the cross check between observables in neutrino experiments and observables at future high energy collider experiments .",
