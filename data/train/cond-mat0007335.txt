    "materials whose constituent elements are much larger than atoms or simple molecules are now ubiquitous .",
    "such substances include polymer blends , colloidal suspensions and emulsions . in the manufacture of such large components , it is impossible to produce a pure strain of truly identical particles .",
    "instead , each colloidal latex is minutely different in size from its colleagues , and the number of monomers on each long polymer molecule inevitably varies across some distribution .",
    "these systems are said to be ` polydisperse ' , though the word is applied only loosely to the polymeric case , since not every molecule is unique .",
    "some intriguing experimental @xcite and simulational @xcite data have been collected from polydisperse systems .",
    "for instance , unusual textures have been found in polydisperse polymer blends @xcite , and coexisting phases of hard spheres have been shown to contain unequal proportions of the various particle sizes , in both simulation @xcite and experiment @xcite .",
    "it is important , then , to understand the statistical thermodynamics of polydisperse mixtures .",
    "it is well known how to calculate the equilibrium state of a thermodynamic system @xcite . at fixed temperature",
    ", an expression must be found for the helmholtz free energy .",
    "it is then straightforward to determine any property of the system at equilibrium : its value is that which minimises the free energy . to establish the concentrations of the system s various constituents ,",
    "the minimisation must be performed subject to constraints of global conservation .",
    "the constitution of a uniform system can not vary , because the amount of each component is conserved , but the free energy can sometimes be lowered by partitioning into coexisting phases of differing compositions .",
    "the non - trivial part of this procedure is to establish a formula for the helmholtz free energy . in principle , the subsequent minimisation to derive phase equilibria is simple .    for a polydisperse system",
    "the story is quite different . here",
    ", the number of components is thermodynamically large . in general",
    ", this does not greatly complicate the ( already difficult ) many - body problem of formulating the free energy .",
    "however , since that free energy is now a function of infinitely many conserved variables , the minimisation procedure , though formally understood @xcite , becomes intractable .    in the past , many calculations have been performed to study the effects of polydispersity , using pedagogical model systems with a convenient form of hamiltonian @xcite , species distribution @xcite , or approximate free energy @xcite .",
    "also , approximate solutions can be found by making _",
    "ad hoc _ guesses about the compositions of coexisting phases , and then minimising with respect to just a few variables such as the overall density of each phase @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the minimisation can be performed numerically , by replacing the continuous distribution of concentrations with an arbitrary , finite set of variables @xcite .",
    "the above methods invariably involve some way of approximating the many - body problem inherent in the thermodynamics of the particular system .",
    "the present study differs in that we shall calculate _ only _ the effects of polydispersity .",
    "the analytical procedure was outlined recently @xcite , and is presented in more detail in the present article , and applied in new ways to solve a range of problems in the physics of polydispersity .",
    "the method is a perturbative one , whereby polydisperse phase equilibria are derived from a reference state that is monodisperse and also in multi - phase equilibrium .",
    "we make no assumptions as to the nature of the system , and require no special properties or approximations to ensure tractability of the statistical mechanics , since we shall not address the underlying many - body problem .",
    "instead , we assume that the many - body properties of the monodisperse reference system are known ( whether from experiment or theory ) , and derive some exact thermodynamic relations , applicable to most systems , for the _ changes _ in its properties due to the introduction of polydispersity .",
    "the aim then is to treat a polydisperse system as a perturbation to a monodisperse reference state , using the variables that characterise the polydisperse particles ( for instance , _ size _ and _ charge _ ) as expansion parameters .",
    "there are two major obstacles to such a theory .",
    "firstly , the reference state is singular . to calculate thermodynamic equilibria , a knowledge of the chemical potential of each species is required . in the reference system ,",
    "the population is zero for all species but one .",
    "unfortunately , the chemical potential of a non - populated species is ( as a rule ) negative infinity .",
    "the second obstacle is that a narrow distribution of species is not necessarily a smooth one , and therefore may not be conducive to small - variable expansion . to proceed , then , we must isolate the badly behaved functions for exact treatment , and expand only smoothly varying quantities .",
    "the distribution of species is not expanded ( contrast @xcite ) , so that any such distribution may be treated , including a set of delta peaks representing a finite number of components .",
    "the canonical ensemble is used throughout , as it is of greatest practical relevance .",
    "thus , the overall mix of species ( the ` parent distribution ' ) is specified _ a priori _ , and the pressure and chemical potentials are derived quantities , used to calculate the resulting distribution adopted by each coexisting phase after partitioning .",
    "perturbative methods suggested previously @xcite have been dogged by a proliferation of variables , leading to unwieldy expressions . that problem is avoided here by relating all properties of the polydisperse system to just two or three functions that parameterise a generic free energy .",
    "an alternative approach for perturbing about a monodisperse reference is to assume that all species but one are dilute , and to use their _ concentrations _ as small expansion parameters @xcite , in the manner of a virial series . in the present study , by expanding in the width , rather than height , of the distribution of polydisperse components",
    ", we are using a reference state that correctly treats the many - particle interactions of concentrated , phase - separated systems .",
    "for narrow distributions therefore , this series is expected to converge more quickly than a virial - like expansion .",
    "an exception is at critical points , where both methods fail .",
    "the formalism and notation are set out in the next section , where a generic free energy is perturbatively expanded to low order , to derive the pressure and chemical potentials of a single polydisperse phase .",
    "these expressions are used in section [ phaseequilib ] to analyse polydisperse phase equilibria .",
    "the normalised distributions , giving the _ relative _ amount of each species in each phase , are calculated in section [ fractsection ] .",
    "their _ differences _ ( due to fractionation ) are found to obey a very simple law . for systems that are simultaneously polydisperse in two properties ( e.g.  size and charge )",
    ", this law is shown to describe ` convective fractionation ' , whereby one property is partitioned between phases due to a driving force on the other . in section [ shiftsection ] ,",
    "the effect of polydispersity on the total number densities at coexistence is calculated .",
    "the resulting shift of a phase boundary along the density - axis of a phase diagram is shown to be proportional to the variance ( standard deviation squared ) of the parent distribution , in the limit of a narrow distribution .",
    "explicit expressions are given for the cloud- and shadow - point densities , as well as more general binodals .",
    "all the derived formulae quantifying polydisperse phase equilibria are expressed in terms of a couple of basic parameters of the free energy . in case",
    "the free energy is not known for the polydisperse system in question , a method for evaluating the relevant parameters is given in section [ pert ] for soft interaction potentials , and in section [ hard ] for hard spheres and related systems .",
    "the method for soft potentials is extended to determine the lowest - order effect of polydispersity on correlation functions in appendix [ correlations ] . to demonstrate the ease of use of the formulae for phase equilibria ,",
    "they are applied in section [ fh ] to a flory - huggins model of chemically polydisperse polymers , and in section [ example2 ] to fluid - fluid coexistence in colloid - polymer mixtures , where slight polydispersity is shown to widen the coexistence region .",
    "consider a polydisperse phase of overall number density @xmath0 , whose constituent particles are distinguished by a number @xmath1 of properties ( _ e.g_.  mass , charge , diameter , oblateness  ) .",
