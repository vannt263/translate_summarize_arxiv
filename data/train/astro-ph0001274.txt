    "the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) is observed to be inhomogeneous with cold ( @xmath6 k ) clouds embedded in a warmer ( @xmath7 k ) intercloud gas ( see , for example , the review of kulkarni & heiles 1988 ) .",
    "the theoretical explanation for this structure was provided by field et al .",
    "( 1969 ) who showed that two thermally stable phases can coexist in pressure equilibrium over a limited range of pressures , close to those observed in the ism . since the two - phase model of field",
    "et al . ( 1969 ) , the thermal and ionization equilibrium of the ism and its stability have been studied by many authors including different heating and ionizing processes ( black 1987 ; kulkarni & heiles 1988 ) .",
    "the response of the ism to variations in physical processes and parameters are of interest both to a better understanding of the ism behavior and because of its central role in star formation and galaxy evolution models .",
    "effects on the ism equilibrium of variations in , for example , x - ray and far uv radiation fields , cosmic ray ionization and metal abundance have been studied by several authors ( shull & woods 1985 ; parravano 1987 ; wolfire et al .",
    "1995 ; parravano & pech 1997 ) . in this work",
    ", we are interested in a particular process : the flux of ionizing photons coming from the radiative decay of neutrinos ( sciama 1990 ) . notwithstanding",
    "this is a speculative theory , sciama has argued in a set of papers ( sciama 1993 , 1995 , 1997a , 1997b , 1998 ) that it can explain the widespread ionization far from the galactic disk and many other observational results .",
    "the simplification in sciama s work is to assume a temperature of @xmath8 k without explicitly solving the thermal equilibrium .",
    "the former was made by dettmar & schulz ( 1992 ) who showed that heat input associated with neutrino decay is too small to account for the observed ism temperature .",
    "however , their conclusion that neutrino decay can not be a dominant source of ionization could be mistaken , as was pointed out by sciama ( 1993 ) , because they neglected the existence of other known heating mechanisms .",
    "our goal here is to analize , in a more complete and self - consistent way , the effect of ionization due to neutrino decay on the thermochemical equilibrium of the ism .    in sect .",
    "2 we discuss the physical processes included in this work and provide the basic equations . sect . 3",
    "is dedicated to a discussion of the results , and the main conclusions are summarized in sect .",
    "in order to analize the effect of neutrino decay photons on the thermochemical equilibrium , a simple model for the ism is used .",
    "the included cooling mechanisms are : a ) cooling by collisions of electrons with c@xmath9 , si@xmath9 , fe@xmath9 , o@xmath9 , s@xmath9 and n ( @xmath10 ) ; b ) cooling by collisions of neutral hydrogen with si@xmath9 , fe@xmath9 and c@xmath9 ( @xmath11 ) ; and c ) cooling due to ly-@xmath12 excitation by electrons ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "all the cooling rates and the relative abundances were taken from dalgarno & mccray ( 1972 ) .",
    "we consider the following heating mechanisms : + a ) interaction of cosmic ray with hydrogen atoms and electrons : @xmath14 \\nonumber \\\\ { \\rm ergs\\ cm^{-3}\\ s^{-1}}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the total number density of hydrogen , @xmath16 is the number density of electrons and @xmath17 is the ionization degree of hydrogen .",
    "the number of secondary ionizations ( @xmath18 ) was taken from dalgarno & mccray ( 1972 ) , and the primary ionization rate is assumed to be @xmath19 ( spitzer 1978 ; black et al .",
    "1990 ; webber 1998 ) .",
    "+ b ) heating by @xmath20 formation on dust grains ( spitzer 1978 ) : @xmath21 c ) photoelectric heating from small grains and pahs ( bakes & tielens 1994 ) : @xmath22 where the heating efficiency ( @xmath23 ) is given by @xmath24 } + \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{3.65\\times10^{-2 } \\left ( t/10 ^ 4 \\right)^{0.7}}{\\left [ 1 + 2\\times10^{-4}\\left ( g_o t^{1/2}/n_e \\right ) \\right]}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath25 is the far uv field normalized to its solar neighborhood value .",
    "we only consider ionization / recombination for hydrogen .",
    "the recombination rate is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the recombination coefficient to all states except the ground one , and it was taken from spitzer ( 1978 ) .",
    "the rate of ionization by cosmic rays is given by @xmath28 we also use the simple analytic fits provided by wolfire et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to estimate the ionization ( @xmath29 ) and heating ( @xmath30 ) due to the soft x - ray background as functions of the column density ( @xmath31 ) and the electron fraction ( @xmath32 ) . in this work",
    "we adopt @xmath33 .",
    "in addition to the above sources of ionization , we also consider the photons produced by neutrino decay .",
    "the ionization due to this mechanism can be written in the form ( sciama 1990 ) : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the absorption cross section of hydrogen and @xmath0 is the flux of hydrogen - ionizing photons produced by neutrino decay . in this work",
    "@xmath0 is a free parameter , although sciama ( 1997a ) estimated that a value of @xmath36 photons @xmath4 s@xmath5 is necessary to produce an electron density @xmath37 @xmath38 in the intercloud medium .",
    "the most recent ( but still uncertain ) estimation was @xmath39 photons @xmath4 s@xmath5 ( sciama 1998 ) .",
    "the thermochemical equilibrium is calculated by solving simultaneously the equations @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the total cooling rate , @xmath43 is the total heating rate , and @xmath44 is the total ionization rate . fig .",
    "1a shows the equilibrium pressure - density relations for @xmath45 and for three different values of @xmath0 ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xmath4 s@xmath5 ) .",
    "the corresponding electron fractions ( @xmath32 ) are showed in fig .  1b , where it can be seen that , as expected",
    ", @xmath32 increases as @xmath49 increases . most of the ionization for the cases @xmath50 @xmath4 s@xmath5 is due to photons coming from neutrino decay , and thus the neutrino decay is a very efficient ionization mechanism .",
    "an increase in @xmath49 ( and the consequent increase in the electron density ) enhances the cooling by electron collisions ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "additionally , the dominant heating mechanism is always photoelectrons from grains and pahs ( @xmath51 ) , which almost it is not affected by the flux @xmath49 .",
    "consequently , for a given density , when @xmath49 increases the thermal equilibrium is reached at lower temperatures in the regions where @xmath10 dominates the cooling ( high densities ) , and the equilibrium curve is shifted down ( see fig .",
    "in contrast , at low densities ( @xmath52 @xmath38 ) , the dominant cooling mechanism is @xmath13 , which decreases when @xmath49 increases and , in this case , the equilibrium is reached at higher temperatures .",
    "1a also shows that two regions of thermal stability , i.e. , where the slope is positive ( field 1965 ) , always exist and two phases can coexist in pressure equilibrium if the interstellar pressure @xmath53 is between a minimum ( @xmath2 ) and a maximum ( @xmath1 ) value . for the case",
    "@xmath54 we obtain @xmath55 k @xmath38 and @xmath56 k @xmath38 ; and if we assume an equilibrium pressure of @xmath57 k @xmath38 , then there can be gas with @xmath58 k , @xmath59 @xmath38 and @xmath60 , and gas with @xmath61 k , @xmath62 @xmath38 and @xmath63 coexisting in equilibrium .",
    "these results agree roughly with observational estimations of the warm and cold neutral phases in the local ism ( kulkarni & heiles 1988 ) .",
    "furthermore , it can be seen in fig .",
    "1a that @xmath1 , the maximum pressure value over which only the cold phase can exist , decreases as @xmath49 increases . for @xmath64 @xmath4 s@xmath5 and for @xmath65 @xmath4 s@xmath5",
    "we obtain @xmath66 k @xmath38 and @xmath67 k @xmath38 , respectively ; but observations indicate that the pressure in most of the regions of the galactic plane is @xmath68 k @xmath38 ( jenkins et al .",
    ". therefore , there seems to be an inconsistency between the observed pressure in a multi - phase medium and high @xmath0 values .",
    "the basic reason for this behavior ( that high @xmath0 values imply too low @xmath1 values ) is that neutrino decay is a poor heating agent , while other processes can ionize _ and _ heat the ism .",
    "for instance , when the cosmic ray ionization rate ( @xmath69 ) is changed ( keeping @xmath70 fixed ) , we find that @xmath1 decreases as @xmath69 increases , but for @xmath71 s@xmath5 the heating by cosmic rays ( @xmath72 ) becomes more important that heating by photoelectrons from grains and pahs ( @xmath51 ) , and then @xmath1 begins to increase as @xmath69 is increased .",
    "the minimum @xmath1 value is @xmath73 k @xmath38 .",
    "however , more efficient heating mechanisms that those considered here can rise up the equilibrium curve increasing @xmath1 . in order to illustrate this effect ,",
    "we have plotted in fig .  2 @xmath1 as a function of @xmath0 for three different values of @xmath25 ( 1 , 10 and 20 ) and , in consequence , three different values of @xmath51 ( believed to be an important heating mechanism in the ism ) .",
    "we can see that as @xmath0 is increased @xmath1 decreases until a minimum value ( @xmath74 k @xmath38 for @xmath75 , @xmath76 k @xmath38 for @xmath77 and @xmath78 k @xmath38 for @xmath79 ) and after that remains constant .",
    "this occurs when @xmath80 in the warm gas and , therefore , additional increases in @xmath49 do not produce additional changes in this phase .",
    "2 shows that if an ism pressure of @xmath81 k @xmath38 is assumed , a two - phase medium is possible for @xmath75 only if @xmath82 @xmath4 s@xmath5 , and for @xmath79 only if @xmath83 @xmath4 s@xmath5 . we conclude that high fluxes of neutrino decay photons ( @xmath68 @xmath4 s@xmath5 ) can be consistent with a two - phase medium only if more efficient heating sources are acting on the gas .",
    "sciama ( 1997a ) estimated that @xmath84 @xmath4 s@xmath5 is necessary to produce @xmath37 @xmath38 at @xmath85 k. fig .",
    "3 shows @xmath16 as function of @xmath0 for @xmath86 k and for the same three values of @xmath25 given in fig .  2 .",
    "the desired electron density at this temperature can be reached at high @xmath0 values only if @xmath87 and , again , more efficient heating sources seem to be necessary .",
    "an interesting consequence has to be noted : _",
    "neutrino beams from neighboring regions may induce the condensation of cold clouds stimulating the formation of stars_. the importance of star formation triggered by previously formed stars has been recognized by many authors ( see the review of elmegreen 1992 ) . triggering mechanisms are usually related to compression of the ism by shock waves from close supernovas , because the transition warm gas @xmath88 cold gas is promoted if the ism pressure rises over @xmath1 .",
    "although this kind of mechanism can act only over short distances ( compared with the galaxy size ) it can propagate over large scales , and the idea of self - propagated star formation has been used to study the formation of spatial patterns in galactic disks ( mueller & arnett 1976 ; gerola & seiden 1978 ; seiden & gerola 1979 ; schulman & seiden 1990 ; jungwiert & palous 1994 )",
    ". however , the phase transition warm gas @xmath88 cold clouds can be also obtained by decreasing @xmath1 under @xmath89 ( assumed constant ) if the local flux of decaying neutrinos increases due , for example , to an increase in the supernova explosion rate .",
    "this triggering mechanism depends on the propagation of neutrinos , and therefore can act over large distances in short time intervals . on the other hand , star formation can also inhibit in different ways the warm gas condensation self - regulating the star formation process inclusively over large distances ( cox 1983 ; franco & shore 1984 ; struck - marcell & scalo 1987 ; parravano 1988 , 1989 ) .",
    "it has been shown that star formation inhibition ( rather than stimulation ) can also contribute to the formation and maintenance of spatial patterns in galaxies ( freedman & madore 1984 ; chappell & scalo 1997 ) .",
    "stimulation and inhibition mechanisms of star formation must be acting simultaneously in the galaxy , but it is not clear yet what spatial scales are important for each one .",
    "the effect of _ non - local _ star formation stimulation on the formation of spiral patterns in galaxies should be analysed in future models .",
    "the thermochemical equilibrium of the ism , including decay of neutrinos into an ionizing photon flux @xmath0 , was calculated . the range @xmath90",
    "@xmath4 s@xmath5 always shows two regions of stability ( a warm and a cold phase ) that can coexist in equilibrium if the ism pressure is below a threshold value ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "high @xmath0 values ( @xmath91 @xmath4 s@xmath5 ) estimated by sciama ( 1997a ) to produce @xmath92 @xmath38 at @xmath93 k , only can be consistent with observed ism pressures if more efficient processes are heating the gas .",
    "it also was showed that a neutrino flux increase ( due , for example , to an increase in the supernova explosion rate ) may stimulate the condensation of cold gas ( and probably the star formation ) by decreasing @xmath1 under the ism pressure value .",
    "this work has been partially supported by condes of universidad del zulia .",
