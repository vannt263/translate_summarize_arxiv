    "a great variety of mapping techniques are presented in the literature . in nuclear physics",

    "related work is contained in refs .  .",
    "this paper considers an approach that was originally developed in the context of atomic physics .",
    "it was invented independently by girardeau  @xcite and vorobev and khomkin  @xcite .",
    "the method has been continuously improved throughout the last two decades , and has been used by girardeau and others in several areas of atomic physics  .",
    "although the method shares several properties with the traditional mappings used in nuclear physics  @xcite , it presents particularities that make it suitable for hadronic problems as we shall discuss shortly ahead .",
    "it is based on the ideas of mapping between physical and ideal fock spaces , and has some similarities with the method of bohm and pines  @xcite to treat collective motions in plasmas .",
    "it is a generalization of a transformation employed by s. tani  @xcite in 1960 to study single - particle scattering by a potential with a bound state .",
    "girardeau coined the name  fock - tani \" representation for this method .    in the fock - tani representation one",
    "starts with the fock representation of the system using field operators of elementary constituents which satisfy canonical ( anti)commutation relations .",
    "composite - particle field operators are linear combinations of the elementary - particle operators and do not generally satisfy canonical ( anti)commutation relations .",
    " ideal \" field operators acting on an enlarged fock space are then introduced in close correspondence with the composite ones .",
    "the enlarged fock space is a graded direct product of the original fock space and an  ideal state space \" .",
    "the ideal operators correspond to particles with the same quantum numbers of the composites ; however , they satisfy by definition canonical ( anti)commutation relations .",
    "next , a given unitary transformation , which transforms the single composite states into single ideal states , is introduced .",
    "when the transformation acts on operators in the subspace of the enlarged fock space which contains no ideal particles , the transformed operators explicitly express the interactions of composites and constituents .",
    "application of the unitary operator on the microscopic hamiltonian , or on other hermitian operators expressed in terms of the elementary constituent field operators such as electroweak currents , gives equivalent operators which contain the ideal field operators .",
    "the effective hamiltonians and currents in the new representation are hermitian and have a clear physical interpretation in terms of the processes they describe . since all field operators in the new representation satisfy canonical ( anti)commutation relations , the standard methods of quantum field theory can then be readily applied .",
    "several characteristics of the fock - tani representation make it suitable to the nature of the hadronic problem .",
    "it seems to be particularly relevant for the building of effective hadronic hamiltonians in the context of effective field theories  @xcite , as it implements in a certain sense the  quasiparticle \" method of weinberg  @xcite . in weinberg s quasiparticle approach the bound states are redescribed by elementary particles and , in order not to change the physics of the problem , the potential is modified in such a way that it can not produce these bound states any longer . in the fock - tani representation , as a result of the transformation of the quark hamiltonian , the quark - quark interactions become  weaker \" , in the sense that they describe only quark - quark scattering processes and can not produce the hadrons as bound states .",
    "the interesting feature of the fock - tani representation is that the change of the potential is the result of the unitary transformation that implements the mapping of composite hadrons into elementary hadrons , while in weinberg s approach there is some freedom in how the potential is modified .",
    "other appealing features of the fock - tani representation are : ( a )  it can be naturally extended to composites with any number of constituents , not only pairs or triplets of fermions , ( b )  systems of composite bosons and fermions , i.e. systems containing simultaneously mesons and baryons , can be naturally treated in a unified manner , and ( c )  it can be used with models where creation and annihilation of particles play an important role .    in the following section we review the basic ideas of the fock - tani representation .",

    "in this paper , we have extended the fock - tani representation to hadronic physics .",
    "the formalism was used for a general class of constituent quark models , independently of a specific form of the microscopic interaction .",
    "we derived the unitary transformation iteratively as a power series in the fock - space hadron amplitude , obtained the transformed quark and antiquark operators , and derived effective hamiltonians .",
    "the effective hamiltonians are hermitian and describe all possible interactions among the composite hadrons , and the interactions of the composite hadrons with their elementary constituents ( quarks and antiquarks ) , consistent with the microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "the transformed quark and antiquark operators are completely general , they depend only on the quark structure of the hadron states . given a microscopic quark hamiltonian , the effective hamiltonians can be immediately derived . there is no restriction to relativistic or nonrelativistic kinematics .",
    "the method can be used with models where explicit gluon degrees of freedom ( or other degrees of freedom such as goldstone bosons ) are present in the states and in the microscopic hamiltonian , as well as with models of multicomponent fock - space amplitudes .",
    "the fact that in the fock - tani representation all field operators satisfy canonical commutation relations allows the direct use of the traditional field theoretic methods . for the baryon case , in particular",
    ", great opportunities for applications in many - baryon systems are envisioned .",
    "different methods have been employed in the literature to study various aspects of quark degrees of freedom in nuclei .",
    "since the traditional picture of the nucleus is that of a system of hadrons , the explicit dynamics of the color degree of freedom must be limited to very short distances .",
    "this means that an approach using quark degrees of freedom should minimally deviate from , as well as contain in some limit , the traditional one . in this sense ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian of the fock - tani representation has a well - defined limit , since it explicitly describes the interactions among hadrons ; quark - quark and quark - hadron interactions are treated separately as  residual \" interactions , since the effects of the bound states are explicitly subtracted from the microscopic interaction .",
    "herewith the properties of the hadron - hadron interactions and nuclei at high densities and/or temperatures using quark degrees of freedom can be carried out in a systematic and controllable fashion .",
