    "quantum storage is crucial to quantum information processing  knill , zhou , barenco .",
    "its importance rests with two issues : mapping the qubits with shorter coherence time into a system with relatively longer coherence time  @xcite ; and storing the quantum states of the physical system difficultly operated into the states of the system manipulated feasibly  @xcite .",
    "superconducting qubits , such as the charge qubits , flux qubits and phase qubits , are hopeful candidates for the basic blocks in the architecture of quantum computer  @xcite since they exhibit feasibility to be well manipulated and well integrated  charge , vion , flux , mart , yu , pash .",
    "currently the decoherence of the superconducting qubits is relatively fast so that no enough logical operations can be performed for a practical quantum computing .",
    "thus people expect that the superconducting qubits can be stored in some system for which the decoherence time is long enough so that the stored qubits can be operated within an enough time .    to overcome the disadvantage of superconducting qubits a hybrid quantum processor has been suggested interfacing the solid state system and the molecular ensemble  @xcite , in which the ensemble of cold polar molecules was used as a long - lived quantum memory storing the information of superconducting quantum qubits by collective spin state via microwave raman processes in a high - q stripline cavity  @xcite .",
    "further more , a holographic quantum computing has been demonstrated using this protocol  holo .",
    "these conceptual designs used the real photons as the data bus , and the corresponding schemes depend on an exact time control to switch photon - qubit and photon - molecular couplings effectively on and off .",
    "based on the above considerations , to avoid the difficulty in exactly controlling evolution time , we study the data bus role of quantum transmission line . by adiabatically eliminating the variables of the transmission line as quantum data bus ,",
    "we obtain dark state for the effective coupling between molecular ensemble and the charge qubit .",
    "and then adiabatically manipulating the control field , the superconducting charge qubit can be mapped into the collective quasi - spin state of the molecular ensemble , and a reversing operation in a latter time will regenerate the charge qubit state . during the adiabatic passage the transmission line is virtual excited and no real photons in the transmission line",
    "are exchanged between the charge qubit and the molecular ensemble . in this sense the effective dark state of the charge qubit and the molecular ensemble computing system plays crucial role .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the circuit qed setup hybridized with embedded molecular ensemble . in sec .",
    "iii , we demonstrate how the off - resonate coplanar cavity field induces the effective coupling of charge qubit to collective excitation of molecular ensemble and the existence of the quasi - dark state at parameter resonance . in sec .",
    "iv , we show that using the effective dark state , quantum storage of the charge qubit state can be implemented through an adiabatic manipulation .",
    "we consider a hybrid system shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] that consists of a cold molecular ensemble , a cooper - pair box ( charge qubit ) and the stripline cavity formed by a transmission line resonator  @xcite .",
    "the molecular ensemble consists of @xmath0 identical and noninteracting @xmath1-type molecules , each with a ground state @xmath2 , an excited state @xmath3 ( see in fig .  [ setup ] ( b ) ) . at the antinodes of quantum electromagnetic field in stripline cavity ,",
    "the polar molecules with large electric - dipole moment achieve the strong coupling , similarly as that in the circuit qed system  @xcite .",
    "is coupled to @xmath2 and @xmath4    we place the cooper - pair box and the molecular ensemble in two antinodes at a distance . in some proper conditions  @xcite , the cooper - pair box can be reduced to a two - level quantum system ( charge qubit ) with jaynes - cummings type coupling to the single mode cavity field .",
    "the hamiltonian of the circuit qed system reads@xmath5where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the quantum cavity field annihilation and ( creation ) operator , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) the lowering ( raising ) operator , and @xmath10 the strength of the interaction between the stripling cavity field and the cooper - pair box .",
    "the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the frequency of charge qubit and the quantum cavity field respectively . here",
    "we have assumed @xmath13 for convenience in this paper .",
    "initially we can prepare the polar molecule in the ground state @xmath2 , which is coupled to the excited state @xmath14 by the quantum electromagnetic field in the stripline cavity . while the coupling of the ground state @xmath2 to the metastable excited state @xmath15 is realized through the classical control field with the rabi frequency @xmath16 .",
    "thus the hamiltonian for the coupled molecular ensemble - stripline cavity can be written as @xmath17where @xmath18 is the interaction strength of the quantum cavity field to the molecular ensemble , @xmath19 and @xmath20 the molecule s energy level spacings with respect to the excited state and the metastable excited state respectively , and @xmath21 the frequency of the control field .    here",
    "we adopt the quasi - spin wave approach developed in ref .",
    "@xcite and invoke the bosonic operators @xmath22to describe the collective excitation of the ensemble . to this end we rewrite the above hamiltonian @xmath23 in terms of the free part @xmath24and the interaction part @xmath25 where @xmath26 . in the large @xmath0 limit with the low excitation condition",
    "that there are only a few atoms occupying the level @xmath14 or @xmath27  @xcite , the operator @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) behaves as a boson which satisfies the bosonic commutation relation @xmath30 = 1,\\left [ c , c^{\\dag } \\right ] = 1.\\]]in the same limit , we also have @xmath31 = 0,\\left [ a , c^{\\dag } \\right ] \\rightarrow 0,\\]]which means that two boson modes described by @xmath28 and @xmath29 are independent with each other .",
    "we emphasize again that , the current hybrid system based quantum storage protocol requires an exact time control for couplings of charge qubit to photons and photons to molecular ensemble .",
    "namely , one can switch on ( off ) the couplings exactly in an arbitrarily given instance .",
    "such a time control process includes two steps : a ) couple the photon to the charge qubit firstly ; b ) then switch off the previous coupling and switch on the coupling of the photon to the molecular ensemble again . due to the time - energy uncertainty",
    ", this kind of time control protocol would inevitably result in experimental errors .",
    "it is much appreciated that we can avoid these errors . with these considerations ,",
    "we detune stripline cavity field slightly from both the charge qubit and the molecular ensemble .",
    "thus the effective interaction between the charge qubit and the molecular ensemble will be induced by adiabatically eliminating photon degrees of freedom .",
    "initially , we prepare the microwave field in the vacuum state , then the interaction between the charge qubit and the molecular ensemble is induced by the virtual excitation of the transmission line field , with no exchange of the real photons between the charge qubit ( molecular ensemble ) and the field .",
    "the process can be schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ ske ] . here",
    "both the qubit and the molecular ensemble interact simultaneously with the continuum of the cavity field whose spectral structure is illustrated in the top of fig .",
    "we will show as follows that , under some conditions related to the large detuning the virtual photon transition happens between the qubit ( molecular ensemble ) and the transmission line cavity .",
    "the photon - assisted transitions can not happen in practice , but the effective interaction between qubit and the molecular ensemble is induced , which is similar to the conventional contact interaction . therefore , our present protocol does not need an exact time control for the coupling of the photon qubits to the charge qubit ( to the molecular ensemble ) .",
    "next we study in details the virtual photon exchange process by deriving the effective hamiltonian through a canonical transformation . in the rotating frame in terms of a time",

    "in this section , we will show how to store the quantum information of the charge qubit in the molecular ensemble by using the above quasi - dark state . in this quantum storage scheme ,",

    "now we consider whether the charge qubit state can be  mapped into the molecular ensemble effectively .",
