    "x - ray variability appears to be ubiquitous in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . the rapid and seemingly random fluctuations in the x - ray luminosity of seyfert galaxies provided early support for the standard black hole / accretion disc model ( e.g. rees 1984 ) by implying compact emission regions and high luminosity densities ( fabian 1979 ; m@xmath4hardy 1989 ) .",
    "the long ( @xmath5 day ) , uninterrupted observations possible with  allowed the power spectral density ( psd ) of seyfert 1 galaxies to be measured for the first time ( lawrence & papadakis 1993 ; green , m@xmath4hardy & lehto 1993 ) .",
    "the psd represents the average of the ( squared ) amplitude of variations as a function of temporal frequency ( see van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "the  observations showed that the psds of seyfert 1s above @xmath6  hz could be approximated by a power - law ( @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the power at frequency @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the psd slope ) rising steeply at low frequencies with a slope @xmath11 ( so - called `` red noise '' spectra ; press 1978 ) .",
    "it was noted early on ( e.g. lawrence 1987 ; m@xmath4hardy 1989 ) that this red noise variability of seyferts is similar to that observed in galactic black hole candidates ( gbhcs ; van der klis 1995 ) , perhaps suggesting that the same physical processes operate in these sources that differ in black hole mass by factors of @xmath12 .",
    "the steep slopes of the  psds mean that at lower frequencies the psd must flatten in order for the integrated power to converge .",
    "indeed , breaks in the psds of seyfert galaxies have recently been detected ( edelson & nandra 1999 ; uttley , m@xmath13hardy & papadakis 2002 ; vaughan , fabian & nandra 2003 ; markowitz 2003 ) .",
    "the position of these breaks represent `` characteristic timescales '' in the aperiodic variability of seyfert 1s , and interestingly they appear to scale linearly with the mass of the central black hole ( markowitz 2003 ) .",
    "the psds of gbhcs usually show at least two breaks ( nowak 1999 ; lin 2000 ) , and it is becoming increasingly apparent that the psds of seyfert galaxies ( and their timing properties in general ) are very similar to those of gbhcs except shifted to longer timescales according to the black hole mass ( vaughan 2003 ; markowitz 2003 ) .",
    "this letter presents an analysis of the x - ray continuum variability of the bright seyfert 1 galaxy  ( aka .",
    "ngc 4253 ; @xmath14 ) using a long  observation",
    ".  offers the possibility to improve upon the high frequency psds provided by , having as it does a similarly long orbit but greatly increased throughput and a wider bandpass .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ sect : data ] describes the basic data reduction procedures , section  [ sect : psd ] details the results of the psd analysis and section  [ sect : cross ] describes the cross spectral results .",
    "finally the implications of these are discussed in section  [ sect : disco ] .",
    "was observed by  ( jansen 2001 ) over the period 2001 may 20  2001 may 21 ( rev .",
    "265 ) , during which all instruments were operating nominally .",
    "the present analysis is restricted to the data from the european photon imaging cameras ( epic ) .",
    "other aspects of this observation are discussed in mason ( 2002 ) .",
    "the epic pn camera ( strder 2001 ) was operated in small - window mode , as was the mos2 camera ( turner 2001 ) , and mos1 was operated in timing mode . here",
    "only data from pn are used as these have the highest signal - to - noise ratio and are free from photon pile - up .",
    "extraction of science products from the observation data files ( odfs ) followed standard procedures using the  science analysis system v5.3.3 ( sas ) .",
    "the epic data were processed using the standard sas processing chains , source data were extracted from a circular region of radius 35 arcsec from the processed pn image .",
    "only events corresponding to patterns 04 ( single and double pixel events ) were used for the pn analysis .",
    "background events were extracted from regions in the small window least effected by source photons .",
    "these showed the background to be relatively low and stable throughout the first 105  ksec of the observation . during the final @xmath15",
    "ksec the background rate increased dramatically . the much stronger ( and highly variable ) background level during this part of the observation contributed a significant amount of non - source variability , and",
    "so only the first 105  ksec of the light curve are used for the variability analysis presented here .",
    "light curves were extracted from the epic pn data in four different energy bands : 0.210.0  kev ( full band ) , 0.2 - 0.7  kev ( soft band ) , 0.7 - 2.0  kev ( medium band ) and 2.0 - 10.0  kev ( hard band ) . these were corrected for telemetry drop outs ( less than 1 per cent of the total time ) , background subtracted and binned to 100  s time resolution .",
    "the errors on the light curves were calculated by propagating the poisson noise .",
    "the light curves were not corrected for the @xmath16 per cent `` live time '' of the pn camera ( strder 2001 ) , which is only a scaling factor . the full band light curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] . the average source ( background subtracted ) and background count rates are shown in table  [ tab : basic ] along with the fractional excess rms variability amplitude of the source ( @xmath17 ; edelson 2002 ) in each energy band .    .",
    "basic properties of the light curves .",
    "mean source and background count rates and fractional excess rms variability amplitudes ( @xmath18 ) in each energy band . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the cross spectrum is related to the psd ( sometimes known as the auto spectrum ) .",
    "it offers a comparison of two simultaneous light curves ( e.g. from different energy bands ) as a function of temporal frequency .",
    "the cross spectrum can be used to derive the coherence ( @xmath19 ) of two light curves ( a measure of how well correlated the variations in the two light curves are ) and time delays between the light curves ( see vaughan & nowak 1997 and nowak 1999 for an explanation of these properties in terms of gbhc observations and papadakis , nandra & kazanas 2001 and vaughan 2003 for an application to seyfert galaxies ) .",
    "the coherence of  was measured using the recipe given by vaughan & nowak ( 1997 ) .",
    "the periodograms of the two light curves and their cross periodogram were computed and binned by @xmath20 consecutive frequencies per bin the coherence and its uncertainty were then calculated using equation 8 of vaughan & nowak ( 1997 ) . (",
    "vaughan 2003 have shown that uncertainty estimates calculated in this way are accurate for data very similar to those examined here . )    the resulting coherence functions ( fig .  [ fig : coherence ] ) show that , particularly between the soft and hard bands , the coherence is significantly below unity at all frequencies .",
    "this means that either the relation between soft and hard bands is non - linear or that a fraction ( @xmath21 ) of the hard band variance can not be accounted for by variations in the soft band .",
    "the apparently poor ( linear ) correlation between variations in different bands is confirmed by an analysis of the cross correlation function , estimated using the discrete correlation function ( dcf ; edelson & krolik 1988 ) .",
    "the dcf for the soft versus hard band light curves reaches a peak ( at zero time delay ) of only 0.65 .",
    "it should be noted that the reduced coherence is not an artifact of poisson noise in the data as the recipe of vaughan & nowak ( 1997 ) correctly accounts for this .",
    "the low coherence means it is not possible to reliably search for time delays between the different bands .",
    "the hardness ratios were calculated to further examine the relationship between variations in different energy sub - bands ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] ) .",
    "the hardness ratios are significantly variable but show little correlation with the total source flux .",
    "there is a slight trend for the 0.72.0/2.010.0 kev ratio to soften as the source brightens ( as has been seen in other seyfert 1s ) but the ratios show a great deal of scatter ( much larger than expected from the size of the error bars ) not obviously associated with changes in the full band flux .",
    "this complements the coherence analysis and shows the the relationships between energy sub - bands are complex .",
    "the shape of the high frequency power spectrum of  is consistent with a power - law that breaks from a flat slope ( @xmath0 ) to a steep slope ( @xmath22 ) at a frequency @xmath23  hz .",
    "there is no evidence for discrete features such as quasi - periodic oscillations ( previously claimed by boller 2001 , but see also benlloch 2001 ) .",
    "similar broken power - law psds have been observed in other seyfert 1s ( uttley 2002 ; vaughan 2003 ; markowitz 2003 ; m@xmath4hardy 2003 ) .",
    "this shape for the high frequency psd is similar to that of gbhcs ( nowak 1999 ; lin 2000 ) . not only is the shape the same but the amplitudes are similar .",
    "the power ( in @xmath24 units ) measured at the break frequency is @xmath25 in the 210  kev band , which compares with the power at the high frequency break in cyg x-1 of @xmath26 ( belloni & hasinger 1990 ) .",
    "this strongly supports the idea that the variability mechanisms , and perhaps the x - ray emission processes in general , are the same in agn and gbhcs .    in the best studied gbhc , cygnus x-1 in its low / hard state , the psd breaks from @xmath27 to a steeper slope at @xmath5  hz ( belloni & hasinger 1990 ; nowak 1999 ) . in its",
    "high / soft state the position of the high frequency break increases to @xmath28  hz ( churazov & gilfanov & revnivtsev 2001 ) .",
    "it is not clear which of these states is closer to the behaviour of seyferts .",
    "the corresponding break frequency in  is a factor of @xmath29 or @xmath30 times higher than that seen in cyg x-1 , depending on whether the low / hard or high / soft state is used for comparison . assuming a @xmath31  mass black hole in cyg x-1 ( hererro 1995 ) , and further assuming that the characteristic break timescale scales linearly with black hole mass ( see markowitz 2003 ) yields estimates for the mass of the black hole in  of @xmath32 or @xmath33  ( comparing with low / hard and high / soft state psds respectively ) .",
    "these estimates are unusually low compared to the masses expected for seyfert nuclei ( e.g. wandel , peterson & malkan 1999 ) . indeed , wandel ( 2002 )",
    "estimated the mass of  to be @xmath34  based on its luminosity and optical broad - line properties .",
    "the highest mass estimate consistent with a linear scaling of timescales , obtained using the 90 per cent lower limit on the break frequency in  and scaling by the break seen in the high / soft state in cyg x-1 , is @xmath35  .",
    "the ( unabsorbed @xmath36  kev ) x - ray luminosity of  is @xmath37  erg s@xmath38 ( assuming @xmath39  km s@xmath38 mpc@xmath38 and @xmath40 ) .",
    "taking a fairly conservative estimate of the bolometric luminosity of @xmath41  erg s@xmath38 and the highest black hole mass estimate suggests  is radiating at @xmath42 .",
    "of course , this depends on there being a linear scaling between the break timescales in cyg x-1 and those of seyfert 1s .",
    "if this is the case the implication seems to be that  is accreting above the eddington limit .",
    "a further point is that if the slope of the low frequency psd is significantly different from the assumed @xmath43 then the break frequency could be lower ( fitting a model assuming @xmath44 gave @xmath45  hz ) .",
    "comparing this to the low - frequency break in cyg x-1 ( the break from @xmath46 to @xmath27 in the low / hard state ) gives an even lower black hole mass estimate ( see the discussion in uttley 2002 ) .",
    "however , the fact that the high frequency psd is steep ( @xmath47 in the hardest band ) suggests a slope of @xmath48 below the break is more likely , by comparison with the psd of cyg x-1 .",
    "it is perhaps worth noting that  has previously been classified a narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) , a class of agn often suggested to be accreting close to the eddington limit ( boller , brandt & fink 1996 ) .",
    "the psds of other nls1s also seem to show break frequencies somewhat higher than found in `` normal '' seyfert 1s ( ark 564 : pounds 2001 ; papadakis 2002 ; ngc 4051 : m@xmath4hardy 2003 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that nls1s harbour lower mass black holes accreting at a higher rate ( relative to eddington ) compared to the normal seyfert population .",
    "it remains plausible that the mass - timescale relation is not perfectly linear .",
    "the most important physical timescales associated with accretion flows ( e.g. section 5.8 of frank , king & raine 1985 ) derive from a distance and a speed over which some physical process operates ( such as viscosity ) .",
    "if the salient distance ( such as the radius of the innermost edge of the accretion disc ) is approximately the same in units of the gravitational radius ( @xmath49 ) between cyg x-1 and agn then the timescales should ( to first order ) scale linearly with black hole mass .",
    "however , if the relevant distance is not constant then this linear scaling can break down .",
    "for example , the innermost stable circular orbit around a black hole depends on its dimensionless spin parameter ( @xmath50 ) , with a spinning black hole allowing a steady accretion disc to extend to smaller radii ( in gravitational units ) .",
    "if  has a higher spin parameter than cyg x-1 one would perhaps expect the accretion disc to extend to smaller @xmath51 and the physical timescales to be somewhat smaller than the linear expectation .",
    "such a situation would allow the black hole mass of  to be higher by a factor of a few ( compared to the linear assumption ) and thereby allow for a sub - eddington accretion rate .",
    "an independent estimate of the mass of  ( from e.g. reverberation mapping or gas kinematic studies ) would help clarify this issue .",
    "the variations in different energy bands show a coherence well below unity at all frequencies examined .",
    "a loss of coherence at high frequencies has also been observed in  ( vaughan 2003 ) , but at the lowest frequencies probed the coherence was much higher than observed in . on longer timescales",
    "the variations in ngc  7469 were consistent with unity coherence ( papadakis 2001 ) .",
    "in cyg x-1 the coherence is known to be high ( near unity ) over a wide range in frequencies but falls significantly below unity at high frequencies ( nowak 1999 ) .",
    "the reduced coherence means the relationship between variations in different energy bands can not be described by a single ( linear ) transfer function .",
    "if the x - rays are produced by inverse - compton scattering in a hot corona , as is often thought ( e.g. haardt & maraschi 1991 ) , then the low coherence implies rapid changes in the coronal properties and/or multiple independent emission sites .",
    "as discussed by nowak & vaughan ( 1996 ) , a static comptonising corona should produce unity coherence .",
    "rapid changes in the properties ( e.g. size , temperature , optical depth ) of the x - ray emitting region could cause changes in the transfer function ( relating soft to hard flux ) on the timescales probed and so reduce the coherence . alternatively",
    "the low coherence may mean there is more than one transfer function operating simultaneously , which could be physically realised if the x - ray emission is produced at several independent sites .    has opened the door on high frequency timing studies of agn , a door that has remained largely closed since the end of the mission .",
    "future work must establish whether the high frequency power and cross spectral properties observed in the handful of seyfert 1s with  long - looks ( see also vaughan 2003 and m@xmath4hardy 2003 ) are universal or whether different objects show different characteristics ( perhaps as gbhcs show distinct states ) .",
    "based on observations obtained with , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
