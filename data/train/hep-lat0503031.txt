    "the combination of an automatic @xmath1-improvement , the infrared regulation of small eigenvalues and fast dynamical simulations render the so - called twisted mass fermions @xcite a most promising formulation of lattice qcd .",
    "there are already a number of results for the quenched approximation @xcite .",
    "also full qcd simulations with this approach have been performed and revealed a surprising phase structure of lattice qcd @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "extensive calculations in chiral perturbation theory were done @xcite .",
    "one of the problems that appeared in the discussion of twisted mass fermions is the exact definition of the critical bare quark mass . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that using the critical value of the bare quark mass where the pion mass vanishes , leads to a quark mass dependence of the pion decay constant @xmath6 that deviates strongly from the expected linear behavior .",
    "this  bending phenomenon  was observed when the quark mass @xmath7 obeys the inequality @xmath8 the bending phenomenon was interpreted in a way that for such small values of the quark mass the wilson term becomes the dominant term in the lattice wilson - dirac operator , thus leading to large lattice artefacts .    in refs .",
    "@xcite it has been suggested to take the value of the critical mass where the pcac quark mass vanishes . in chiral perturbation theory",
    "it was demonstrated that this definition leads to a stable situation of  maximal twist  and hence to a reduction of lattice artefacts that otherwise would be enhanced at very small values of the quark mass . in refs .",
    "@xcite the theoretical background of such a definition is discussed on a general ground .    in this paper , we employ the definition of the critical mass by computing _ at non - zero twisted mass _ the critical hopping parameter as a functions of the twisted mass parameter and finally taking the limit to zero twisted mass . such a definition is expected to eliminate large @xmath5 artifacts at small values of the pion mass and should hence avoid the bending phenomenon . in the following we will shortly describe the encouraging results employing this improved definition of the critical mass .",
    "a more detailed scaling analysis of mesonic quantities will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will work with wilson twisted mass fermions that can be arranged to be @xmath1 improved without employing specific improvement terms @xcite .",
    "the wilson tmqcd action in the twisted basis can be written as @xmath9 = a^4 \\sum_x \\bar\\psi(x ) ( d_w + m_0 + i \\mu \\gamma_5\\tau_3 ) \\psi(x)\\ ; , \\ ] ] where the wilson - dirac operator @xmath10 is given by d_w = _ = 0 ^ 3 [ _ ( _ ^ * + _ ) - a _ ^ * _ ] [ dw ] and @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the usual forward and backward derivatives .",
    "we refer to @xcite for further unexplained notations .",
    "the definition of the critical mass @xmath0 will be discussed in detail in the next section .",
    "we extract pseudoscalar and vector meson masses from the correlation functions at full twist ( @xmath13 ) : @xmath14 where we consider the usual local bilinears @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the untwisted pcac quark mass @xmath18 can be extracted from the ratio m_=a=1,2 .",
    "[ mpcac ]    using the pcac relation we can also compute the pion decay constant at maximal twist without requiring any renormalization constant ( see @xcite ) : f_= | 0 | p^a | | a=1,2 .",

    "the wilson tmqcd action of eq .",
    "( [ tmaction ] ) can be studied in the full parameter space @xmath19 .",
    "a special case arises , however , when @xmath20 is tuned towards a critical bare quark mass @xmath21 . in such , and only in such a situation , all physical quantities are , or can easily be , @xmath1 improved .",
    "the critical quark mass , or alternatively the critical hopping parameter @xmath22 , has thus to be fixed in the actual simulation to achieve automatic @xmath1-improvement at maximal twist .",
    "in general , the definition of the critical mass has an intrinsic uncertainty that comes at @xmath1 for wilson fermions .",
    "this could be improved to an @xmath5 uncertainty by using clover fermions .",
    "if a definition of @xmath23 from a linear extrapolation of @xmath24 is used , one has in addition an unrelated systematic error coming from the long way of extrapolation from large pion masses of o(600 mev ) . +",
    "a better definition of @xmath23 can be obtained by the following procedure :    * at fixed non - zero twisted mass parameter the hopping parameter @xmath25 is determined as the point where the pcac quark mass of eq .",
    "( [ mpcac ] ) vanishes .",
    "the non - zero value of the twisted mass allows a safe interpolation in this case . * as a further step , an only short linear extrapolation of @xmath25 from small values of @xmath26 to @xmath27 yields a definition of @xmath23 which is expected @xcite to lead to small lattice artefacts , in particular also at small quark masses much below values indicated in the inequality of eq .",
    "( [ inequality ] ) .    in figure [ fig : newkc ] we show an example of this extrapolation at @xmath28 , where we also indicate the @xmath23-value determined by the vanishing pion mass squared .    the possible choices for the determination of the critical bare quark mass were also discussed in chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "recently , a definition of maximal twist from parity conservation has also been investigated in @xcite . there , however , the critical masses @xmath29 were not extrapolated to @xmath27 , but were used at the respective twisted mass parameter at which they were determined .",
    "in this section we will provide a comparison of wilson twisted mass results for the pion mass , the pion decay constant and the @xmath30-mass obtained with two different definitions of @xmath23 .",
    "the first , `` pion mass '' definition , refers to the limit @xmath24 taken at @xmath31 .",
    "the second , `` pcac quark mass '' definition , corresponds to the determination of @xmath25 at fixed @xmath32 from the vanishing of the pcac quark mass , @xmath33 and then taking the limit @xmath34 .",
    "the latter @xmath23 values were determined on a subset of @xmath35 configurations for three couplings , namely @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the simulations were performed for a number of bare quark masses in a corresponding pion mass range of @xmath38 using a multiple mass solver @xcite on @xmath39 gauge field configurations generated with the wilson plaquette gauge action .    in general the time component of the tensor correlator",
    "provides a better signal for the vector meson mass compared to the axial - vector correlator at maximal twist .",
    "this observation was made independently in @xcite and is manifest in the smaller error bars displayed in figures of this section .",
    "the first quantity we investigated was the pion mass . in figure",
    "[ fig : pion ] we show the behavior of @xmath40 versus @xmath26 for the two definitions of @xmath23 .",
    "the results for the pcac quark mass definition show a linear behavior down to very small bare quark masses , while a small non - zero value is approached in the chiral limit with the pion mass definition of @xmath23 .",
    "this residual @xmath1 pion mass at @xmath27 can be attributed to the @xmath1 error in the critical mass determined by the vanishing of the pion mass in the pure wilson case .    at @xmath28 ( lattice size @xmath41 , @xmath42 )",
    "we computed correlation functions also for a third , intermediate definition of the critical mass : we chose the point where the pcac quark mass vanishes at small , but non - zero value of the twisted mass . in figure",
    "[ fig : compare5.70 ] we show the results for the pion decay constant and the vector meson mass .",
    "it is obvious that already this intermediate definition of @xmath23 substantially diminishes the bending tendency of the data when approaching the chiral limit .",
    "such a definition of the critical hopping parameter @xmath43 seems to be sufficient to eliminate the deviation from a linear behavior for all twisted mass values @xmath44 .",
    "the results for @xmath45 from the pcac quark mass definition show a straight behavior for both observables down to pion masses of about 250 mev .",
    "the bending phenomena reported in @xcite can thus be attributed to the pion mass definition of the critical mass in this simulation .",
    "note that at @xmath28 we are working at a rather coarse value of the lattice spacing .    at @xmath46 ( lattice size @xmath47 , @xmath48 )",
    "we can now compare our previous and new wilson twisted mass results with the data from overlap fermion simulations @xcite which were obtained on a smaller lattice volume ( @xmath49 ) . using the definition of @xmath23 from the vanishing of the pcac quark mass , the bending near the chiral limit vanishes almost completely both for the pion decay constant and the vector meson mass extracted from the tensor correlator ( see figure [ fig : compare5.85 ] ) . in both cases the overlap fermion results lie slightly higher than the twisted mass fermion results .",
    "this fact might be explained by residual finite volume effects and/or different lattice artefacts .",
    "finally we show in figure [ fig : compare6.0 ] the results at @xmath50 ( lattice size @xmath47 , @xmath51 ) . although the physical volume is smaller than the one at @xmath46 we are able to confirm the absence of bending for small masses when using the pcac quark mass definition of @xmath23 . for the pion decay",
    "constant we observe a very good agreement with the overlap fermion results of ref .",
    "@xcite and with the twisted mass results using the parity conservation definition of the critical mass from ref .",
    "@xcite . for the vector meson mass",
    "we refrain from comparing with the parity conservation definition , since the error bars would cover both our results with the pion mass and pcac quark mass definition of the critical mass .",
    "we have studied wilson twisted mass fermions with different definitions of the critical mass . the  bending phenomena  in basic observables like the vector meson mass and the pion decay constant using the critical mass from vanishing pion mass at @xmath31 reported in @xcite is absent for the choice of @xmath23 from the vanishing of the pcac quark mass in the limit @xmath52 .",
    "this is true even at small values of the pion mass close to the experimentally measured value where maybe contact to chiral perturbation theory can be made .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the same definition of the critical mass has been employed , _ but at fixed twisted mass parameter separately at each simulation point_. the results of this reference taken together with the findings in the present paper lead to the conclusion that the pcac quark mass definition of the critical hopping parameter is a crucial element of twisted mass simulations in order to keep @xmath5 effects well under control at small quark masses . this conclusion is in accordance with theoretical considerations @xcite .",
    "employing the pcac quark mass definition of the critical mass the wilson twisted mass formulation provides the possibility to perform reliable simulations at very small quark masses ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "thus , wilson twisted mass fermions can be used to explore really light quarks on the lattice - as light as with overlap fermions , but at considerably lower cost ( see @xcite for a detailed cost comparison ) .",
    "this opens a very promising prospect for dynamical fermion simulations and renders twisted mass fermions as a real alternative to staggered fermions without the conceptual difficulties of the latter .",
    "we thank r.  frezzotti , g.  c.  rossi , l.  scorzato , s.  sharpe and u.  wenger for many useful discussions .",
    "the computer centers at nic / desy zeuthen , nic at forschungszentrum jlich and hlrn provided the necessary technical help and computer resources .",
