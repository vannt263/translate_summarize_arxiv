    "an ideal quantum computer is a physical architecture that implements any unitary operation @xmath7 $ ] on @xmath8 qubits , and quantum computation ( qc ) is expressed by a quantum circuit composed of universal gates , such as one - bit gates @xmath9 $ ] and controlled - not gates  @xcite .",
    "simple qc on a few qubits has already been demonstrated experimentally in various systems , including nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr )  @xcite , ion - trap  @xcite , superconducting qubit  @xcite , and all - optical  @xcite systems .",
    "more recently , several architectures consisting of many particles as two - level quantum systems have also been proposed for larger - scale computations  @xcite .",
    "however , it remains difficult with the present technical capabilities for the manipulation of qubits to realize large - scale unitary operations over quantum circuits , even if a system with many qubits can be successfully fabricated .",
    "quantum circuits are usually designed on the assumption that qubits can be manipulate individually , requiring the skillful application of some external effect to cause a subtle change in the state of a single particle .",
    "furthermore , control of quantum correlations between particles is necessary to realize gate operations , similarly requiring skillful control of switch interactions between qubits .",
    "the magnitudes of interactions are often restricted in practical systems , and are dependent on the configuration of particles .",
    "additional operations ( e.g. , swap operations ) are often needed to realize gate operations for qubits without interaction . as the number of qubits increases , such tasks become too delicate and too complicated to be accomplished within the coherence time of physical systems .",
    "the present study introduces a quantum circuit designed to avoid the above technical problems regarding the manipulation of qubits in large - scale computation .",
    "the circuit proposed here simulates a specific multiple - qubit gate  the toffoli gate ( @xmath10-not gate )  @xcite , which is regarded as an important unit for constructing @xmath11-dimensional unitary systems @xmath12 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "this gate plays a critical role in grover s search algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the proposed circuit performs @xmath5 @xmath1-not operations simultaneously on @xmath6 qubits per process , where the set of @xmath5 @xmath1-not gates is referred to as a multi - qubit gate ( mqg ) .",
    "it is clarified in this paper that @xmath13 mqg operations simulate @xmath2-not operations under the condition @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this configuration of @xmath1-not gates differs considerably from conventional circuits , in which only one @xmath1-not is performed per process .",
    "the @xmath6 qubits included in an mqg each consist of two control bits and one target bit , and @xmath5 qubits of the same type are given common manipulations to realize the operation .",
    "such manipulations can be performed by application of an external effect that causes the states of all these qubits to change at the same time , eliminating the need to treat qubits individually .",
    "another advantage of the new method is that the simple configuration of @xmath1-not gates in an mqg makes it possible to realize operations in practical systems , where the interactions of qubits are restricted .",
    "accordingly , the technical tasks for manipulating qubits are simplified and reduced in number , regardless of the number of qubits .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the new quantum circuit simulating a toffoli gate is introduced , and the mqg structure is presented .",
    "the proposed circuit is used to simulate @xmath14-not operations as an example of the implementation . in sec .",
    "iii , an nmr implementation of the mqg operation is briefly discussed , assuming a triangular lattice as a simple physical system with many qubits .",
    "the feasibility of the circuit is demonstrated by showing the manipulation of qubits using resonance fields .",
    "the study is finally summarized in sec .",
    "figure 1 shows a quantum circuit that simulates a @xmath15-not gate . in this section",
    ", the characteristics of the circuit are described , and the process of changing the states of qubits is explained through an example implementation .      the proposed quantum circuit ( fig .",
    "1 ) includes @xmath16 qubits , where the @xmath17 bits labeled @xmath18,@xmath19 and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) act as control bits , and the ( @xmath16)-th bit labeled @xmath22 is the target . here ,",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) @xmath31 denote the input ( output ) basis for the qubits labeled @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "as proven in the appendix , the outputs @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are given by @xmath36 the solid frame in fig .",
    "1 contains @xmath37 @xmath1-not gates that transform the states of @xmath37 qubits labeled @xmath35 simultaneously .",
    "these gates are regarded as a unit gate , that is , an mqg .",
    "table 1 shows a comparison of the total numbers of units in the proposed circuit and a conventional circuit in which @xmath1-not operations are performed individually .",
    "the number of qubits in the proposed circuit is restricted to @xmath16 , but the high expected functionality of the circuit outweighs this restriction .",
    "most importantly , in the operation of the mqg , all qubits with the same label undergo the same transformation , that is , identically labeled qubits can be manipulated as a single qubit .",
    "this means that the skill and time required for the manipulation of @xmath38 qubits are similar to those required for a @xmath1-not gate on @xmath39 qubits , regardless of the number of qubits .",
    "such mqg operations can be readily realized in practical systems without strong long - distance interactions , representing another advantage attributable to the simplicity of the circuit .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in the quantum circuit composed of mqgs , the state of the input is changed by some complex process . here",
    ", the transformations in a quantum circuit simulating a @xmath14-not gate are shown as an example of the operation of an mqg circuit ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the bases of inputs @xmath23 and @xmath26 @xmath40 are transformed to @xmath27 and @xmath30 .",
    "this circuit is divided into a number of blocks @xmath41 ( dotted frames ) , where the bases of the input / output in each block are defined as @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 / @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "@xmath45 is transformed to @xmath47 through @xmath48 .",
    "it can be readily checked that the bases @xmath47 and @xmath48 satisfy the following equation : @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] and [ eq:2 ] ) , @xmath54 and @xmath55 can be expressed as @xmath56    then , noting the equations , @xmath57 and the relation of @xmath58 , we have the result @xmath59 .",
    "in this section , a method for tuning the interactions required for realizing mqg operations is examined .      as a physical system containing multiple qubits , a simple structural model of a triangular lattice",
    "is considered ( fig .",
    "4 ) . here , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 represent nuclear spins ( @xmath60 ) , which realize quantum bits corresponding to the labels @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the quantum circuit shown in fig .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model is defined as @xmath61 the terms @xmath62 ( @xmath63 is a pauli operator ) in the above equation represent nearest - neighbor interactions connecting qubits ( solid and dotted lines in fig .",
    "4 ) , the magnitudes of which are given by @xmath64 .",
    "it is realistic that nearest - neighbor interactions are dominant in physical systems , and it can be expected that such a simple structural system may be fabricated artificially .",
    "the manipulation of qubits in an nmr quantum computer is performed by applying resonance magnetic fields at appropriate larmor frequencies , the values of which depend on the physical states of spins with respect to the kinds of atoms and chemical environment . to access all @xmath65 spins in a system individually ,",
    "the states must be designed such that each spin can be modified via a different larmor frequency .",
    "when @xmath65 is large , these differences are very small , and it is inevitable that the manipulation of qubits becomes sensitive and complex in large - scale systems .    the method proposed in this study avoids these difficulties by eliminating the need to manipulate qubits individually .",
    "this is particularly advantageous when the number of qubits is large .",
    "mqg operation can always be realized by applying six cases of resonance field .",
    "the resonance fields are set according to lamor frequencies of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , corresponding to qubits @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 in fig .",
    "it should be noted that six different physical states are given to each spin according to these labels .",
    "the preparation of such conditions can be achieved much more readily than the case of @xmath65 different state for all @xmath65 qubits .",
    "an mqg is a group of @xmath1-not gates .",
    "the spins of @xmath76 and @xmath43 ( or @xmath42 and @xmath77 ) correspond to control bits , and @xmath77 ( or @xmath78 ) acts as a target .",
    "to realize the operations of @xmath1-not operations simultaneously , the interactions denoted @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( solid lines in fig.4 ) or @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( dotted lines ) are employed .",
    "the effects of these interactions can be extracted from the temporal evolution of the system by applying the above six kinds of resonance fields to the system instantaneously , as expressed by    @xmath85    in these equations , the operators @xmath86(@xmath87 ) represent the effects of the resonance fields that rotate spins by @xmath88 about the @xmath89 axis .",
    "the application of a single field with frequency @xmath90 causes all spins with label @xmath91 to undergo a simultaneous transformation of rotation .",
    "@xmath86 are defined as @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the pauli operator .",
    "a new construction of a toffoli gate ( @xmath10-not gate ) was presented .",
    "the process is expressed as a quantum circuit with simple configuration of multi - qubit gates ( mqgs ) , each of which implements @xmath37 @xmath1-not operations simultaneously . as @xmath65 in @xmath10-not is restricted to @xmath94 @xmath95 in the proposed system , the operation of @xmath96-not ( @xmath97 ) is implemented by fixing the states of unused qubits to @xmath98 . however , while this circuit is restricted in the number of qubits it must contain , it offers much greater feasibility for practical implementation .",
    "for example , mqg operation can be realized using realistic simply structured systems , and does not involve the individual manipulation of qubits .",
    "these advantages are expected to be valuable in a range of systems , including the example nmr scheme briefly discussed in this paper .",
    "this study has shown that the technical practicality of operations in quantum circuits can be incorporated into quantum circuit design without loss of functionality .",

    "( 1 ) expresses the relation between inputs and outputs in the proposed circuit .",
    "this result is derived as follows .",
