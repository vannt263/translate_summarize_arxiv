    "we consider currency exchange rate models in which the exchange rate is allowed to move inside a _ target zone _ with one or more barriers which are enforced by monetary authorities .",
    "target zone models were pioneered by krugman in  @xcite and also studied in  @xcite , among others . in these models ,",
    "the price process is modeled by a diffusion process which is reflected at one or more barriers .",
    "for instance one can think of a currency exchange rate that is kept above a certain threshold due to central bank intervention , such as it has recently been the case for the rate of the swiss franc against the euro .",
    "this rate has been kept above 1.20 sfr / eur by the swiss national bank .",
    "if in a such a situation swiss francs are sold , then it is natural to do so when the exchange rate is as close as possible to the barrier of reflection .",
    "market impact refers to the empirical fact that the execution of a large order affects the price of the underlying asset .",
    "usually , this affect causes an unfavorable additional execution costs for the trader who is performing the exchange . as a result , a trader who wishes to minimize his trading costs has to split his order into a sequence of smaller orders which are executed over a finite time horizon .",
    "one of the well studied market impact models is the almgren ",
    "chriss model ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein , see also  @xcite for a survey paper ) . in the framework of the almgren - chriss model",
    "it is assumed that the trading transactions cause a temporary imbalance in the supply and demand of the asset which is creating some temporary price movements .",
    "this type of affect on prices is known as _ temporary price impact_. in  @xcite among others , this temporary price impact is modeled as a function of the trading speed .    in this work",
    "we consider trading strategies for an investor for whom prices are optimal at the barrier and who creates temporary price impact .",
    "in this situation , trading will be constrained to those times at which the price process is located _ at _ the barrier .",
    "such strategies can not be absolutely continuous in time , and so trading speed needs to be defined in a manner different from the almgren ",
    "chriss model . in section  [ approx section ]",
    "we will argue by means of an approximation with discrete - time models of almgren ",
    "chriss - type that strategies should instead be absolutely continuous with respect to the local time of the price process at the barrier and that trading speed should be defined as the corresponding radon ",
    "nikodym derivative .",
    "we thus arrive at an appropriate notion of temporary price impact and the resulting transaction costs in our setting .",
    "we formulate the minimization of a cost - risk functional of such strategies as a singular stochastic control problem .",
    "in addition to the expected costs resulting from temporary price impact , the cost functional includes penalizations for current and final deviations from a target positions . in section  [ sec - sol ]",
    "we solve this control problem by means of a scaling limit of critical branching particle systems , which is known as a catalytic superprocess . as in  @xcite",
    ", the nonlinearity of the penalization terms will correspond to the offspring distribution of particles in the superprocess population but , in contrast to  @xcite , branching will only take place for particles that are located _ at _ the barrier of the process . that is , the corresponding superprocess is a _ catalytic superprocesses _ with a point catalyst given by the barrier of the price process .",
    "such catalytic superprocesses have been widely studied for the case in which the one - particle motion is standard brownian motion  @xcite ; a construction for the case in which the one - particle motion is a general diffusion process was given in  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec - proofs ] contains the proofs of our results .",
    "we consider a markovian model @xmath0 where , under @xmath1 , the process @xmath2 is a diffusion process starting from @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 ) and reflecting at a barrier @xmath5 .",
    "such reflecting diffusion processes have often be proposed as models for currency exchange rates in a target zone  @xcite . here , a target zone refers to a regime in which the exchange rate of a currency is kept within a certain range of values , either through an international agreement or through central bank intervention .",
    "an example of such a target zone is the recent lower bound of 1.20 eur / chf that was enforced through the swiss national bank ; see figure  [ eur_chf fig ] .",
    "a realization of reflected geometric brownian motion with a reflecting barrier at @xmath6 is given in figure  [ gbm7.pdf ] for comparison .",

    "we define @xmath16 in the context of a target zone model , the control @xmath11 will be interpreted as a trading strategy that executes orders at infinitesimal rate @xmath17 at those times @xmath18 at which @xmath19 .",
    "for instance , for a swiss investor wishing to purchase euros during the period of a lower bound on the eur / chf exchange rate , it would have been natural to buy euros only at the lowest possible price , which at this time was equal to the barrier of 1.20 eur / chf .",

    "<S> this problem will be formulated as the minimization of a cost - risk functional over strategies that only trade when the price process is located at the barrier . </S>",
    "<S> we solve the corresponding singular stochastic control problem by means of a scaling limit of critical branching particle systems , which is known as a catalytic superprocess . in this setting </S>",
    "<S> the catalyst is a set of points which is given by the barriers of the price process . for the cases in which the unaffected price process is a reflected arithmetic or geometric brownian motion with drift </S>",
