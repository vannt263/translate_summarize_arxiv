    "the time in the modern lorentz - invariant physics is connected with a metric signature .",
    "the spacetime metric for any space can be written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the metric , @xmath3 is 1-form , @xmath4 is vier - bein , @xmath5 is vier - bein index , @xmath6 is the coordinate index and @xmath7 is the metric signature @xmath8 .",
    "an undefined number @xmath9 can be @xmath10 for the euclidean space and @xmath11 for the lorentzian spacetime .",
    "we see that the difference between euclidean and lorentzian spacetimes is connected with the sign of @xmath12 . for @xmath13",
    "we say that there is the euclidean space and for @xmath14 the lorentzian spacetime .    it easy to see that the metric @xmath15 has two different degrees of freedom : vier - bein @xmath4 and the metric signature @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath4 can be determined from einstein s equations but for the metric signature @xmath7 we have not any dynamical equations .",
    "we put in the metric signature @xmath7 by hand into einstein s equations ( in the vier - bein formalism ) . of coarse",
    ", we can determine the true value of @xmath7 from experiments : in our universe @xmath16 .",
    "but on the quantum level ( on the planck level ) we can assume that @xmath7 is fluctuating quantity @xmath17 cosmological solutions of einstein s equations with ordinary matter have almost without exception a cosmological singularity .",
    "the existence of such singularity is one of the most significant problem in the modern physics .",
    "there are various approaches to the solution of this problem . hawking s point of view @xcite is that at the origin of time an euclidean space emerged from nothing and the metric signature near to zero moment @xmath0 has the euclidean value @xmath18 but after short time interval ( @xmath19 ) the signature undergoes a quantum jump to the lorentzian value @xmath20 another words : _ in order to kill singularity we must kill the time .",
    "_ thus we have the following picture for hawking s nonsingular universe ( see , fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the idea presented here is that near to zero moment there are quantum fluctuations between euclidean and lorentzian signatures and after short time ( @xmath19 ) the fluctuations cease and the metric comes to the state with the definite ( lorentzian ) metric signature ( see , fig.2 ) .",
    "we can assume that in quantum gravity can be various sort of quantum fluctuations    1 .",
    "the fluctuations of the metric .",
    "2 .   the topology fluctuations .",
    "this phenomenon is known as a hypothesized spacetime foam .",
    "3 .   the fluctuations of the metric signature . 4 .",
    "@xmath21    here i will consider only the third kind of quantum gravitational fluctuations .",
    "one can say that two different approaches to the problem of the metric signature fluctuations are possible :    1 .",
    "one can solve the einstein s equations with undefined @xmath22 and then we will have fluctuating quantity @xmath9 in the solution .",
    "another approach is that every einstein s equation ( for example , @xmath23 ) with @xmath24 and @xmath25 can have different probability .",
    "we can interpret the second approach as follows : in fact einstein s equations are some algorithm for calculations of the metric in whole space . in this approach",
    "we have an algorithm some parts of which can fluctuate ( see , fig.3 ) .    [ fig4 ]    we assume that the probability of every version of every einstein s equation is connected with a `` complexity '' of the equation .",
    "* what is it the `` complexity '' ? * of coarse",
    "intuitively it is clear .",
    "here we can recall einstein s statement that `` everything should be made as simple as possible , but not simpler . ''",
    "our proposal is that the `` complexity '' is connected with kolmogorov s ideas on algorithmic complexity ( ac ) . in this approach",
    "any physical system ( _ e.g. _ the universe ) can be thought of in terms of an algorithm .",
    "the longer and more complex the algorithm , the less likely it is for such a system to appear . in particular universes with different physical laws ( field equations ) are described by different algorithms .",
    "the length of these algorithms then affects the probability that this universe with a certain set of physical laws will fluctuate into existence .",
    "in our case we will search such combination of the einstein s equations with the different @xmath22 so that the solution will be the simplest .",
    "at first we will give an exact definition for the complexity .",
    "the mathematical definition for algorithmic complexity ( ac ) is    _ the algorithmic complexity @xmath26 of the object @xmath27 for a given object @xmath28 is the minimal length of the `` program '' @xmath29 that is written as a sequence of the zeros and ones which allows us to construct @xmath27 starting from @xmath28 : @xmath30 @xmath31 is length of the program @xmath29 ; @xmath32 is the algorithm for calculating an object @xmath27 , using the program @xmath29 , when the object @xmath28 is given . _",
    "here i would like to consider the scenario where at the origin of the universe fluctuations between euclidean and lorentzian metrics occur @xcite @xcite . we start with a vacuum 5d universe with the metric @xmath33 ^ 2   \\end{split } \\label{fluct60}\\ ] ] here @xmath22 for the euclidean and lorentzian signatures respectively . according to the appropriate theorem the multidimensional metric in eq .",

    "are @xmath38 the whole of algorithm is the concatenation of @xmath39 equations but in our approach every piece of the algorithm ( for example @xmath40 ) can fluctuate ( here @xmath41 is the einstein tensor ) .",
    "our basic assumption is that _ at the planck scale there can exist regions where quantum fluctuations between euclidean and lorentzian metric signatures occur_. there are two copies of the classical equations : one with @xmath42 and another with @xmath43 .",
    "the basic question under our assumption is how to calculate the relative probability for each pair of equations from ( the ones with @xmath42 versus the ones with @xmath43 ) .",
    "we will define the probability for each pair of equations in terms of the ac of each pair .",
    "we can diagrammatically represent the fluctuations between the euclidean and lorentzian versions of einstein s equations in the following way @xmath44 the signs @xmath45 indicates if the equation belongs to the euclidean or lorentzian mode .",
    "expression sums up the idea that treating @xmath9 as a quantum quantity leads to quantum fluctuations between the classical equations : @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
