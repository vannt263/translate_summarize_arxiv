    "an alternative is to measure masses and radii of compact stars , where the bayesian analysis is used to invert the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations @xcite and obtain the most probable equation of state ( eos ) corresponding to a chosen set of observational constraints .",
    "the challenge within this approach is a reliable measurement of neutron star radii .",
    "we quote results from millisecond pulsar timing analyses @xcite rather than burst sources used in @xcite .",
    "prompted by recent findings of a second @xmath3 neutron star @xcite we reexamine the eos for dense matter by constructing non - rotating sequences and studying the possibility of a hybrid star with @xmath3 .",
    "the hybrid eos is constructed from a non - local nambu  jona - lasinio model ( nl - njl ) @xcite with appreciable vector interaction strength @xcite , while for the nuclear matter we use the dd2 eos @xcite .    in this work",
    "we abandon the standard maxwell construction for a first order phase transition , anticipating instead a crossover transition described by an interpolation of the pressure @xmath4 as a thermodynamic potential for the above eos .",

    "the construction leads to a characteristic stiffening on the hadron - dominated side followed by a softening and smooth joining to the quark - dominated side of the eos . while the former maybe due to quark substructure effects ( pauli blocking ) initiating the hadron dissociation ( mott effect ) , the appearance of finite size structures ( pasta phases ) at the quark - hadron interface @xcite and strong hadronic fluctuations @xcite might be responsible for the latter .",

    "the softness of quark matter is then regulated by a strong vector coupling channel .",
    "however , the delay the quark matter onset caused by large vector couplings can be compensated by a strong diquark coupling . in total , if quark matter appears through a first order transition , model calculations indicate that stable stars may require large couplings in both vector and diquark channels .    in this work we limit ourselves to the region of small vector coupling ( @xmath36 ) and offer an alternative mechanism that compensates such relative softness of the quark eos .",
    "we solve the tov equations by using the eos with the crossover construction ( [ eq : eoscross ] ) .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig : tov ] are able to predict stable stars reaching and exceeding @xmath3 already with a small @xmath37 .",

    "if we vaguely consider the crossover region as a mixed phase of hadrons and quarks , we might describe these stars to have a hadronic mantle and a mixed phase core . for mild vector coupling @xmath43",
    "the sequence with pure quark matter lies on the verge of stability , as shown by the triangle on the dashed line in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tov ] .",
    "in addition , it is interesting to note that this sequence lies within the @xmath44 band of both the @xmath3 constraint for psr j0348 - 0432 @xcite and psr j1614 - 2230 @xcite .",
    "the possibility of having only a mixed phase in the @xmath45 stars is due to the tension between the vector coupling and the width of the crossover . with lower values of the vector coupling hadronic matter and quark",
    "matter eos lie closer to each other in the @xmath30 plane so that a smaller crossover region is needed to achieve a causal eos .",
    "by increasing the vector coupling the onset density of quark matter increases and the two eos separate , requiring a larger crossover region .",
    "requiring the transition from hadron to quark matter being unique , any viable hybrid eos model should be able to fulfill the constraint of the recent observational lower limit of @xmath3 for the maximum mass of the corresponding hybrid star sequence . for a wide class of njl models",
    "this is not possible with the standard maxwell construction unless quark matter is in a color superconducting state and has a strongly repulsive vector meanfield .",
    "we have offered an alternative based on the requirement that the transition between quark and hadron matter is a crossover .",
    "we have found that hybrid star configurations reaching or even exceeding the @xmath46 mass constraint have cores comprised of a mixed phase of quarks and hadrons .",
    "this conclusion is similar to the one drawn when promoting the local charge neutrality condition to a global one via gibbs construction @xcite .",
    "our work might be considered as a first step towards a microscopically based construction of the transition from hadron to quark matter either via pasta phases or beyond mean - field studies taking into account the quark substructure of hadrons and their dissociation in the dense medium @xcite .",
