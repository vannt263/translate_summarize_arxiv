    "understanding when and how different types of galaxies formed in the universe is an age old problem . in recent years the hierarchical merging scenario @xcite , where large galaxies are built up over time through mergers of smaller objects , has been the leading theory for the mechanism by which structure formed in the universe .",
    "large galaxy surveys have been undertaken to provide observational evidence for how galaxies formed . from their observations , we are compiling a snapshot of galaxies througout time .",
    "at z@xmath63 we find both massive starbursting galaxies in highly clustered regions @xcite and actively star forming galaxies elsewhere @xcite . at z@xmath62",
    "we see galaxies that are still forming stars , but have redder colors and larger masses from continued star formation since z@xmath63 @xcite . at z@xmath61 - 2 a population of extremely red objects ( eros )",
    "are seen by near infrared surveys such as fires @xcite , k20 @xcite , and munics @xcite , many of which appear to contain older stellar populations that have experienced passive evolution @xcite . at z@xmath61",
    "we see a decrease in global star formation rates @xcite , an increase of stellar mass densities in early - types @xcite , and a change in galaxy morphologies to more ordered systems @xcite . at z@xmath71",
    "we see early - type galaxies that appear to have formed at z@xmath61.5 - 2 in the field @xcite and at z@xmath62 - 3 in clusters @xcite , possibly from those that were seen as star forming galaxies at z@xmath62 and starbursts at z@xmath62 - 3 .",
    "this observed galaxy demography , however , is not matched by the semi - analytic hierarchical galaxy formation models .",
    "although the models do well on predicting the global star formation rate and stellar mass densities , they do not match observations on the correct proportions of galaxy types as a function of redshift @xcite .",
    "in particular , not enough eros or submm galaxies are formed at z@xmath61 - 3 in the models .",
    "we do not yet understand the details of how galaxies assembled their mass , although the epoch of z@xmath61 - 2 continues to stand out as an important transitional period .",
    "detailed studies of individual galaxies around this epoch will uncover essential clues about how they assembled into the distribution of galaxies that we see today .",
    "one such detail for study is determining ages or formation redshifts of galaxies in this epoch .",
    "various techniques have been used in the past to determine an overall age from integrated galaxy light , including using colors to estimate age from the amounts of old ( red ) and young ( blue ) stars , using the equivalent widths ( ews ) of specific spectral lines or breaks that are known to be sensitive to stellar age @xcite , matching galaxy spectra to stellar spectra @xcite , using fits of stellar population synthesis models to spectral energy distributions ( seds ) obtained from broadband or narrowband photometry @xcite , and fitting galaxy spectra with model spectra @xcite .",
    "we will refer to photometric seds throughout the paper as `` seds , '' not to be confused with spectra .",
    "photometry has been widely available and is a good way to cover a larger spectral range than typically available with spectroscopy to get information about different stellar populations , but it lacks spectral details and suffers from more degeneracy between age , metallicity , and dust content .",
    "recent surveys with spectra of hundreds or thousands of galaxies , in addition to the photometry , provide more information for detailed analyses .",
    "furthermore , the release of population synthesis models at high spectral resolution @xcite allows one to take advantage of the detailed information contained in individual lines over the entire observed spectral range , rather than relying on only a few lines or on more degenerate broadband colors .    in this work , we evaluate age and metallicity estimation techniques on globular clusters by comparing results from @xcite simple stellar population ( ssp ) model fits to the spectra , broadband photometry , and line indices of the clusters .",
    "globular clusters provide a simpler test case than galaxies since their stars likely provide a coeval and nearly homogeneous metallicity population that has no internal dust extinction .",
    "we test the utility of using these models to estimate ages and metallicities of high redshift galaxies by first applying them to a sample of extragalactic globular clusters from the @xcite public database that have integrated spectra , photometry , and age or metallicity estimates obtained by other methods .",
    "galaxies will be discused in a future paper .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows .",
    "globular cluster spectra and photometry are described in  2 , comparison ages and metallicities from the literature are described in  3 , the stellar population synthesis models are described in  4 , our model fitting procedures are explained in  5 , age and metallicity results are presented in  6 , a discussion of issues is given in  7 , and conclusions are summarized in  8 .",
    "the @xcite online spectral database provides our sample of extragalactic globular clusters that cover a significant range of age and metallicity , making their results applicable to evolving galaxies .",
    "we chose those clusters that also have photometry available in the literature , which includes 79 clusters in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , 4 clusters in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , and 18 clusters in m31 .",
    "the spectra were obtained with the 1.52 and 2.2-meter telescopes at eso in la silla @xcite , the 2.15-m casleo telescope in argentina @xcite , the 3.6-m cfht in hawaii @xcite , and the 4.2-m william herschel telescope in la palma @xcite .",
    "the data include near ultraviolet , optical , and near infrared spectra , covering a total wavelength range of 3200 - 10000   for some clusters , and varying in spectral resolution from 6 to 23   .",
    "we should note that for all clusters except a few in m31 , this resolution element is larger than the @xmath5  =  10    required for lick / ids line indices .",
    "all available spectral segments for each object are used to utilize maximum wavelength coverage , but since they originate from a number of different sources , flux calibration between regions may not be consistent .",
    "table [ res_tbl ] lists each object with its specific wavelength coverage , spectral resolution , and source references .",
    "we compile photometry of the clusters from various sources in the literature . @xcite",
    "provide ubv photometry for the lmc clusters with @xmath620% of the objects taken from @xcite and the rest re - observed by the authors at ctio or casleo .",
    "@xcite provide vjhk photometry for lmc clusters from observations on 1 - 2.5 meter telescopes at las campanas and cerro tololo observatories . for the smc clusters , @xcite provide vjhk and ubv are from @xcite who use photometry from @xcite and a few other sources .",
    "for the m31 clusters , @xcite supply bvri from observations on the 152-cm telescope in loiano , bologna and on the 4-m kpno telescope .",
    "@xcite provide ubjhk from observations on the 1.2-m telescope at the fred l. whipple observatory .",
    "even for a given globular cluster , a wide range of age and metallicity estimates typically exists in the literature .",
    "this is not completely surprising given the different methods employed to derive the parameters , some based on broadband colors and others on very narrowband spectral line strengths , but the dispersion in estimates is quite large for many clusters .",
    "we will compare our results to age and metallicity values from a number of sources and different techniques to show where our values lie in the total spread .",
    "literature ages and metallicities for specific clusters can be found in table [ age_tbl ] , along with our derived values .",
    "one of the oldest techniques for measuring the age of a star cluster is using its integrated ubv colors .",
    "when placed on color - color plots , globular clusters follow a sequence that can be related to age .",
    "we use mc cluster u - b color ages that were determined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "when photometry is available for individual stars in a cluster , the location of the main sequence turnoff ( msto ) on a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) can be used to determine the age of the cluster .",
    "we use a large compilation of msto ages for mc clusters from @xcite .",
    "refinement of the msto technique is achieved by fitting theoretical isochrones to the cmds .",
    "we take cmd fit ages from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also add comparison ages determined from photometric fits to gissel96 model seds @xcite in the batc filter system , using 15 intermediate bandwidth passbands , by @xcite , and from the line index ratios h@xmath8  /  fe  i @xmath94045 and ca  ii  h / k by @xcite , which were developed to work better on younger objects than the typical lick line indices for use on older objects .",
    "we consider the leonardi & rose line index ratio ages to be some of the most secure , given that they are determined from high quality spectra and are tailored for the younger ages of many clusters in this sample .",
    "@xcite utilize diagnostic diagrams constructed from ew sums of metal ( ca  ii  k , g band , mg  i ) and balmer ( h@xmath8 , h@xmath10 , h@xmath11 ) lines , which are calibrated against literature values and placed on homogeneous age and metallicity scales , to determine ages and metallicites of mc clusters .",
    "we also include these in our comparison values of age and metallicity .",
    "fitting theoretical ishchrones to cluster cmds is generally accepted as the most secure age determination possible when using photometry , however the results do vary between sets of ishochrones .",
    "the absolute derived age depends on model zeropoints and uncertainties .",
    "@xcite find that padova isochrones with agb stars included underpredict the luminosity function of giants by 0.2 - 0.3 dex when compared to observations of 47  tuc , resulting in an overprediction in the spectroscopic age of 2 - 3 gyr for old stellar populations .",
    "young stellar populations are much less affected .",
    "additionally , the padova isochrone uncertainty in t@xmath12 of 75  k leads to a 1  gyr age uncertainty or 0.1 dex uncertainty in the [ fe / h ] scale .",
    "@xcite also find discrepancies between cmd and spectroscopic ages of 47  tuc due to the exclusion of @xmath13-enhancement and atomic diffusion in evolutionary models , causing a zeropoint offset . if 47  tuc is representative of other old stellar populations , for clusters in the 10 - 14  gyr age range these model isochrone issues could lead to spectroscopic based age discrepancies of 20 - 40  % when compared to cmd based values .",
    "large homogeneous samples of globular cluster metallicities are harder to find , since metallicity can not be as accurately determined from photometry and typical methods require high quality spectra .",
    "however , some photometric techniques have been calibrated to spectra .",
    "of these we use [ fe / h ] values from vjk colors by @xcite , fits to cmds @xcite , and fits to gissel96 model seds by @xcite .",
    "our more secure comparison metallicites come from spectra - based techniques .",
    "for these we use [ fe / h ] from the @xcite line index ratios and their comparison literature values that were derived from ews of ca , fe , mg , and na lines @xcite , and from ews of the ca ii triplet at @xmath98500 @xcite .",
    "we incorporate the comparison literature values used by @xcite , which include metal line abundances @xcite , line indices @xcite , and an infrared index at 1.6 @xmath3 m @xcite . and",
    "finally we use a combination of line indices and spectral breaks from @xcite : d(4000 ) , cnb @xmath93883  , g - band @xmath94300  , mgh , mg _",
    "b _ , and fe @xmath95270  .",
    "we use the high spectral resolution ( r@xmath62000 ) ssp `` standard model '' from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ; hereafter bc03 ) that utilizes the stelib / basel 3.1 spectral library , the padova 1994 evolutionary tracks , and the @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) with stellar mass limits of 0.1 and 100 m@xmath14 .",
    "they provide model spectra at [ fe / h ]  = @xmath22.25 , @xmath21.65 , @xmath20.64 , @xmath20.33 , + 0.093 , and + 0.56 , which we linearly interpolate at each wavelength point to a grid of spectra that spans [ fe / h ] of @xmath22.2 to + 0.5 in increments of 0.1 dex , and ages of 1 myr to 20 gyr in increments of 2 myr for 1@xmath1510 myr , 20 myr for 10@xmath15100 myr , 200 myr for 100@xmath151000 myr , and 1 gyr for 1@xmath1520 gyr .",
    "the bc03 models include thermally - pulsing asymptotic branch stars ( tp - agb ) , making use of the multi - metallicity models of @xcite that have been calibrated on stars in the galaxy , lmc , and smc .",
    "the importance of these stars , which have a strong influence on the integrated near infrared light from star clusters of certain ages , will become apparent later in the paper .",
    "this phase can dredge up carbon in the stellar atmospheres , leading to carbon - rich stars , which are also very red and can dominate the near infrared light from some clusters .",
    "although no simple prescription can be expected to match all clusters , these stars must somehow be included .",
    "@xcite achieve this by defining the transition to carbon stars and the duration of this phase with the models of @xcite and @xcite . this semi - empirical prescription for tp - agb and carbon stars has been tested on and provides good agreement with observed colors of magellanic cloud clusters and with optical and near infrared surface brightness fluctuations of metal - poor galactic globular clusters and more metal - rich nearby elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "our approach is to use the maximum amount of information possible for each object .",
    "broadband photometry often covers a much wider spectral range than spectroscopy , providing better constraints on the possible mixes of stellar types , but suffers from age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "however , by combining broadband information with detailed spectral analysis , we hope to better constrain model fits and thus derived ages and metallicities .",
    "we investigate the ability of both broadband and detailed spectral features of the models to estimate age and metallicity of the globular clusters by fitting models to the full spectrum , to the continuum - normalized spectrum , to the continuum shape , to photometry , and to spectral line indices of the clusters .",
    "each of these fitting procedures is described in detail in the following sections .    * _ full spectrum fits _ utilize information from both the line strengths and the continuum shape .",
    "* _ continuum - normalized ( cn ) spectrum fits _ use only the information contained in the lines , losing important continuum information , but also removing any adverse effects of inaccurate flux calibration in the data or continuum shape errors in the models .",
    "model continua problems are particularly possible in the near infrared due to the inability to properly account for the number of tp - agb or carbon stars that can contribute much of the light at these wavelengths . *",
    "_ continuum fits _ use only the continuum shape that was removed from the spectrum . *",
    "_ photometry fits _",
    "cover a much broader wavelength range , but lose detailed spectral information and may also be affected by continuum shape problems in the data or models .",
    "* _ line index fits _ move from broad to narrow and focus only on specific spectral lines that are known to be sensitive to metallicity or age .",
    "we evaluate these specific lines in the models by calculating the indices directly from model spectra and comparing those to line indices calculated from the cluster spectra in the same way .",
    "the spectra for each object in the @xcite database consist of near ultraviolet , optical , and near infrared segments from multiple sources at spectral resolutions of 6 - 23   .",
    "we splice all spectra together to cover the widest possible range for each cluster .",
    "no noise or sky spectra are included in the database , so we must estimate the noise from the spectra . to do this",
    "we calculate the standard deviation of the spectrum in 100    bins and scale the resultant signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) spectrum to match the average s / n value quoted in the source publications for some objects . for those objects that do",
    "not have quoted s / n values , the standard deviation spectrum provides the noise .",
    "this likely overestimates the noise since absorption lines will increase the standard deviation of a bin , but the required scaling is typically less than 10% .",
    "we prepare the data for fitting by marking regions that contain emission lines , noise spikes , and sky background residuals , as well as two regions for which the stelib stellar library used in the models has problems with telluric features ( 6850 - 6950    and 7550 - 7725   ) .",
    "these regions are masked and deweighted for each cluster by significantly lowering its s / n spectrum over the affected wavelengths .",
    "we smooth the grid of model spectra , which have an intrinsic resolution of 3  , to the wavelength dependent resolution of each cluster and fit its spectrum using two free parameters , age and metallicity , and a s / n - weighted normalization constant , @xmath16 , which is uniquely determined for each model .",
    "we select the best fitting model by calculating the summed @xmath17 for each model spectrum of a given age and metallicity , relative to the cluster spectrum , and selecting the model in the grid with the minimum value . in the @xmath17 calculation",
    ", we use the previously determined cluster noise spectrum as the @xmath18 for the flux , _ _ f__@xmath19 , at each wavelength bin , _ i _",
    ", for each model , _",
    "n _ , as given in equations 1 and 2 .",
    "once the best fitting model is determined for a cluster , we inflate its noise until the @xmath20=1 to include any additional noise sources and to better estimate confidence contours and error bars .",
    "if , after this process , the estimated errors are smaller than the distance to the next model grid point , an error bar of half this distance is assigned to the cluster for both age and metallicity .",
    "@xmath21    @xmath22    errors on age and metallicity estimates are determined from the @xmath23 contours .",
    "the s / n of the data controls the size of these contours , and thus the confidence of the derived parameters .",
    "typical levels for the globular clusters are s / n@xmath6100 per resolution element .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows a simulation of the effect of s / n on the confidence of the derived age and metallicity for ngc 419 in the smc , achieved by artificially adding different levels of gaussian noise to its spectrum and fitting models to each of the noisy continuum - normalized spectra .",
    "the simulated s / n per resolution element from top left to lower right in figure  [ fig1 ] is 99 , 22 , 12 , 8 , 6 , and 4 .",
    "solid , dashed , and dotted lines represent 1 , 2 , and 3@xmath24 contours .",
    "the color bars give the @xmath23 values for confidence levels of 68.3% ( @xmath23=2.3 ) , 90% , 95.4% , 99% , 99.73% , and 99.99% ( @xmath23=18.4 ) for two degrees of freedom .",
    "black dots mark the locations of models in the age - metallicity grid .",
    "the best fitting model is marked by a black cross in each panel .",
    "the age and metallicity from the best fitting model in the highest s / n case is marked by a yellow circle in each subsequent panel for comparison .",
    "two things become apparent from these plots .",
    "first , as the confidence contours grow with decreasing s / n , metallicity becomes harder to constrain than age . in some low s / n conditions (",
    "e.g.  the last panel ) multiple islands of age - metallicity combinations arise as equally likely answers .",
    "the best fitting model in each panel does not always overlap the 1@xmath24 contours of all other panels , however , this mostly happens in the [ fe / h ] dimension and those values are less secure than the ages .",
    "this is our first indication that metallicity is poorly constrained , compared to ages .",
    "the second point is that we find a limiting s / n below which the estimated age and metallicity become unreliable .",
    "this happens somewhere between s / n = 22 and 12 in these plots , at which point the contours in the low s / n cases do not overlap the estimates from the highest s / n case .",
    "we find that the s / n must be @xmath2515 per resolution element ( s / n@xmath65  @xmath4 ) for @xmath5=13 - 23    to adequately constrain the age .",
    "metallicity is harder to constrain under all conditions .",
    "a more detailed analysis of limiting s / n and spectral resolution can be found in ",
    "[ snr_sec ] .",
    "errors in flux calibration of the spectra can induce errors in derived ages and metallicities .",
    "additionally , model continua can be off in the near infrared due to stochastic contributions from tp - agb stars in @xmath6 0.1 to 1 gyr old populations and from carbon stars in populations of age 0.3 to 2.5 gyr @xcite .",
    "these variations can result in differences of nearly 2 magnitudes in v - k ( bruzual & charlot 2003 , figure  8) .",
    "agb stars in the thermally pulsing phase can contribute over 80% of the k - band light @xcite , the exact amount of which is hard to predict since this phase involves ejection of the outer stellar envelopes and geometry - dependent obscuration of the central stars .",
    "the bc03 models include tp - agb and carbon stars semi - empirically , but in any given cluster the k - band light can vary depending on the numbers of stars it actually has in these phases .    to avoid these issues ,",
    "we normalize out the continua with a median - binning routine that uses bin sizes tailored to work for different classes of objects .",
    "the young clusters of the magellanic clouds have strong balmer discontinuities and need to be sampled by small bins to correctly trace this sharp continuum break , while older objects in m31 require larger bins to smooth over absorption troughs in the red part of the spectrum .",
    "the bins that we use are 100   wide blueward of 4000    and 300 - 700    wide redward of 4000   .",
    "the points in each bin are sorted by flux values , the lower 1/2 of the points are ignored to reduce the weight of absorption lines , the highest few points are rejected to ignore noise spikes , and the median of the remaining flux values is assigned to that bin .",
    "the medianed bin fluxes are linearly connected and the object spectrum is divided by the result , providing a flat continuum .",
    "the same binning parameters used for an object are also used on each model spectrum in the grid .",
    "removal of the continuum shape should not affect the values of line indices measured on the spectrum , providing a good check of our procedure .",
    "we applied this test , as suggested by the referee , by choosing a random sample of 25 globular clusters spanning the entire age range and measured line indices before and after continuum normalization .",
    "the indices used were mg__b _ _ , fe5270 , fe5335 , h@xmath11 , h@xmath26 , h@xmath27 , h@xmath28 , h@xmath29 , g4300 , @xmath0fe@xmath30 , and [ mgfe]@xmath31 .",
    "only the positive index values that could be reliably measured were used , as in  [ line_ind ] . on average",
    "the values change by less than 1% , and all line index median differences for the 25 clusters are below 3%  with no correlation to the derived cluster age .",
    "the continuum shape that we divide out is also fit by model continua and referred to throughout the paper as `` continuum fits .",
    "'' different types of spectral fits are illustrated in figure  [ fig2 ] for an old cluster , g177 in m31 , and a young cluster , ngc 1711 in the lmc .      to test ages and metallicities",
    "derived from broadband features over a wide baseline , we fit models to the ubvjhk photometry from the literature , using all of the bands that are available for each cluster .",
    "our model fitting procedure requires scalable fluxes , so we convert cluster magnitudes to fluxes using the ubv zeropoints from @xcite and the jhk zeropoints from @xcite .",
    "we obtain model fluxes for each band by convolving filter transmission curves with the model spectra .",
    "these fluxes are scaled to those of the object with an overall s / n - weighted normalization parameter during the fit .",
    "the best fitting model is selected by @xmath17 minimization , using equations [ alpha ] and [ chi2 ] with _ i _ now representing each photometric band .",
    "errors are not given for all literature photometry , so we initially assume a 5% photometric flux error in all bands for each cluster , which is then adjusted to make @xmath20=1 for the best - fitting model .",
    "fitting parameters are age and metallicity .",
    "photometric fits are also illustrated in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "lick line indices have been used for some time @xcite .",
    "they are based on a very specific set of data and their application to new objects is somewhat complicated . to properly use lick / ids indices ,",
    "some of the same stars must be observed with the instrumental setup of the new objects and the spectra of the new objects must be convolved to exactly the same wavelength dependent resolution as the original lick data , which varied from run to run during the development of the indices .",
    "very small differences in the wavelengths can cause large errors in the indices . to investigate the robustness of these specific lines in the model spectra , we calculate line indices directly from the models , similar to the calibrations done in @xcite .",
    "direct application of the models for this purpose would avoid the step of convolving the object spectra to the estimated lick resolutions . if the models are smoothed to the same spectral resolution as the cluster data , indices can be calculated directly from both spectra in the same manner .",
    "however , the bandpasses of the lick indices were originally chosen for data with @xmath5  =  8 - 12    @xcite .",
    "specific lines in lower resolution spectra may begin to lose age and metallicity information .",
    "nevertheless , given the long history of the use of line indices , we wanted to attempt a variation of this technique on data with resolution and s / n representative of that from typical galaxy surveys .",
    "first , we broaden the model spectra to match the resolution of each object , which may vary for wavelength regions obtained on different instruments . then , we calculate indices for the lines in the lick system using the passbands defined in @xcite and @xcite . to these",

    "a similar effect is seen in some of the young clusters , presumably due to a near infrared excess from tp - agb or carbon stars in that case .",
    "some examples of such clusters within the affected age range of 0.1 - 2 gyr are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .      to evaluate the different model fitting techniques , we first compare their results to each other . in the following sections we compare our results to the literature .",

    "the methods that contain the continuum overestimate the ages of many clusters younger than 1 gyr .",

    "the fact that the continuum - full spectrum correlation is tighter than the cn - full spectra correlation ( fractional offset of 2.40 ) suggests that the continuum shape has a larger effect than the spectral lines in constraining the ages of these young globular clusters for our employed fitting methods .",
    "therefore , any problems in the continuum shape of the data or models will have grave effects on the derived ages . for the clusters",
    "older than 1  gyr our tightest estimated age correlation is between the cn spectrum and photometry fits ( figure 4b ) , with a median fractional offset of 0.18 for 12 clusters .    for young clusters",
    "the metallicities obtained from our different techniques show virtually no correlation , with a tendency for the continuum to give higher metallicities than the full spectrum . for clusters older than 1  gyr",
    "there is a very weak correlation between metallicities obtained with continuum and full spectrum fits , possibly indicating that the derived metallicity has a stronger dependence on the continuum shape than the spectral lines for our fitting method .      in figure  [ fig5 ]",

    "the thick cyan horizontal bars connect points that represent the same cluster , but that have ages from multiple sources in the literature .",

    "the thin horizontal bars are the quoted errors on the literature ages and the thin vertical bars are our 1@xmath24 errors on ages derived from model fits .",
    "note that the errors are much larger for the photometry fits , reflecting more degeneracy when using broadband colors than when using spectra or the continua shapes .",
    "over the entire age range spanned by the clusters and considering all literature age estimation techniques , our cn spectrum fit ages best match those from the literature .",
    "the average offsets and rms scatter our ages from groups of literature values based on different techniques are given in table [ rms_age_tbl ] , where column 1 gives values for all clusters in the sample that have literature ages and column 2 excludes two outliers ( for reasons explained in  [ weird_ones ] ) and the clusters that only have literature values from photometric fits to bc96 models ( because these used only a few fixed metallicity values in the model grid , which could skew the derived ages , and they are based on old models ) . excluding these points , our cn spectrum fits compared to the averages of the literature values for each object have an average offset of 0.29  dex ( 0.19  gyr ) with a dispersion of 0.36  dex ( 1.00  gyr ) .",
    "our photometric ages have an average offset of 0.59  dex ( 0.48  gyr ) and dispersion of 0.76  dex ( 1.19  gyr ) .",
    "there are some systematic differences between the two sets of results .",
    "the scatter of the cn spectrum fit points is more uniformly distributed around the literature values , unlike the photometric points that tend to overestimate the age , particularly for the younger clusters .",
    "the full spectrum fits , which contain the continuum , also overestimate the ages below 1 gyr , with an average offset of 0.69  dex ( 0.54  gyr ) and a dispersion of 0.9  dex ( 3.2 gyr ) .",

    "the age range of 0.1 to 1  gyr would be affected by tp - agb stars .",
    "if the model prescription for these stars does not exactly match those in the clusters , then the older ages from fitting methods that include the continuum could be explained by older , redder spectra giving the lowest @xmath17 for clusters that have this near infrared excess .",
    "our derived ages also scatter to older values for clusters younger than 0.1 gyr when using models that include the continuum shape .",
    "this effect is likely due to stocastic red supergiants , which have been observed with estimated masses up to 120 m@xmath14 in the lmc @xcite .",
    "these stars will affect clusters younger than a few tens of myrs .",
    "either the number of red supergiants is underestimated in the bc03 models , or the upper mass cutoff of 100 m@xmath14 for the chabrier imf is not quite high enough for the lmc . see ",
    "[ weird_ones ] for a discussion of two lmc clusters that are dominated by supergiants , which are also our extreme outliers in the cn spectrum fits of figure  [ fig5]a .    because of the large age range covered by the clusters , it is perhaps useful to look at the behavior of the fractional age errors relative to the literature values , which are plotted in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "overall , the cn spectrum fits provide ages with fractional offsets from the literature of 61% , while the photometry does much worse at 1048% .",

    "the dispersion is higher below ages of 0.1 gyr even though the cn spectra are not affected by the continua effects mentioned earlier .",
    "this increased dispersion is likely due to the degeneracy of many spectral lines in this age range ( see figure  [ fig10 ] and  [ line_ind ] ) .",
    "the photometry fits do much worse fractionally on young clusters with an average offset of 1115% ( 0.62  dex or 0.38  gyr ) and dispersion of 0.78  dex ( 1.02  gyr ) , and better on the fractional errors of older clusters with an offset of 23% ( 0.10  dex or 2.06  gyr ) and dispersion of 0.11  dex ( 2.67  gyr ) .",

    "this is likely due to agb stars .",
    "furthermore , the full spectrum and continuum fits have larger age offsets in the older clusters ( 425% and 480% ) than do the cn spectrum or photometry fits , which may be due to flux calibration issues , since both of these methods include the observed spectral continuum shape . to take care of both data and model continua issues",
    ", it appears that continuum - normalized spectral fits are the most robust in producing accurate age estimates for the clusters of all ages .",
    "the age errors do not correlate with metallicity , so they seem to be dominated by the age regime of the cluster . although photometry does a decent job on older objects , it should be noted that after excluding the bc96 photometry literature points , we only have 4 clusters in the @xmath30 1 gyr bin at ages of 1.2 , 2.2 , 12.4 , and 13.1 gyrs .",
    "it could just be that the two younger ones have no problems with boosted near infrared emission .",

    "the full spectrum , continuum , and photometry fits overestimate the ages of many clusters below 1  gyr , apparently suffering from an excess of agb stars making the cluster spectra redder than the models and forcing older aged models to provide the best fits .",

    "the average spectral resolutions of these data are 23 , 13 , 13 , and 13 , respectively .",
    "the derived ages of the clusters hover around the same values as s / n decreases until @xmath65  @xmath4 , below which the derived ages become unstable .",
    "the horizontal line associated with each set of symbols is the average of the derived ages or metallicites for that cluster from its s / n@xmath405 spectra . for comparison ,",
    "the spread of literature ages and metallicities for each cluster are shown as vertical lines of the same styles on the right - hand side of the plots .",
    "our derived parameters for these four clusters fall within the literature age ranges .",
    "if the 0.45 dex [ fe / h ] scale offset is subtracted from the mc cluster literature values , then our average [ fe / h ] lines fall within the literature values for ngc 419 and g158 , which are the clusters older than 1  gyr .",
    "we do not match the literature [ fe / h ] of the younger clusters .",

    "note that the last one is below the limiting s / n value .",
    "we have also begun a study of the effects of spectral resolution on derived ages and metallicities . to accomplish this we smooth model spectra to @xmath5= 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , and 30   , add noise in 10 realizations at each s / n level up to 60  @xmath4 for a total of 300 - 500 simulations at each @xmath5 , and fit cn model spectra to them .",
    "the lowest resolution of @xmath5=30    was chosen to match the lowest typically achieved in galaxy surveys .",
    "we select two input models that are consistent with age and metallicity combinations occupied by some of the globular clusters in this sample and that may also be useful for high redshift galaxies .",
    "these combinations are : 1  gyr , [ fe / h]=0.0 ; and 10 gyr , [ fe / h]=0.0 ( similar to g158 in figure  [ fig12 ] at 18 gyr , [ fe / h]@xmath520.1 , @xmath5=23   ) .    the results of these fits are presented in figures  [ fig14]-[fig16 ] .",

    "age - metallicity degeneracy in the derived parameters can clearly be seen in figure  [ fig15 ] for the two input models at the same spectral resolutions presented in figure  [ fig14 ] .",
    "the increased difficulty of distinguishing older ages is also apparent from the much larger spread in derived ages for this regime where age changes result in small spectral differences .",
    "as spectral resolution degrades , derived ages and metallicities for the lower s / n spectra tend to be driven to the model grid limits more frequently .",
    "we choose limiting s / n values for each spectral resolution corresponding to the point at which the standard deviation in derived ages for a s / n bin begins to increase beyond 10 or 20% of the input model age .",
    "figure  [ fig16 ] summarizes the required s / n  @xmath4 as a function of @xmath5 for the 1  gyr case on the left and the 10  gyr case on the right .",
    "solid lines denote derived ages within 10% and dashed lines within 20% of the input .",
    "recall that the s / n is calculated for these spectra by taking the standard deviation of the flux in wavelength bins along the spectrum , which has the disadvantage that spectral features increase the apparent `` noise '' in the spectrum . because of this fact , there is a limit to the maximum s / n calculated in this manner .",
    "these artificial limits are plotted as dotted lines in figure  [ fig16 ] , and therefore the open upward facing triangles are lower limits to the required s / n at those resolutions .",
    "the 10  gyr object requires higher s / n than the 1  gyr object at almost all resolutions , implying a strong dependence on the object s age .",
    "however , because the age is unknown a priori , the 10  gyr model must be used to determine the minimum required s /",
    "n .    the expected trend is seen for ages within 10% of the input : higher s / n is required for lower spectral resolution . at the 20% level , however , somewhat puzzling behavior is seen for the 10  gyr old object . at @xmath53  15",
    "  the required s / n actually decreases .",
    "this does not appear to be an aritfact of the simulations , as we see no correlations between the number of points within s / n bins and the standard deviation in derived ages .",
    "interestingly , the globular cluster g158 at @xmath5  =  23    in figure  [ fig12 ] may demonstrate similar behavior . although only one noise realization was performed at each s / n level there , its correct age is obtained at much lower s / n than the younger clusters in the plot .",
    "perhaps this trend is real .",
    "one could envision a scenario in which with decreasing resolution model mismatches of narrow lines in the spectrum become less important than broad features typical of old spectra , such as the 4000    break and the mg absorption trough . in order to get the correct age ,",
    "high s / n is required , but once the allowed uncertainty is increased , the broader features can provide enough information in lower s / n spectra . clearly , this is only an initial guide for required s / n and more investigation needs to be done into the cause of this unexpected feature . at the high resolution",
    "end , our results are consistent with those of @xcite who also fit continuum - removed spectra ( via a data compression algorithm ) and find required s / n@xmath611 - 17  @xmath4 ( 20 - 30 per 3    pixel ) at a spectral resolution of 3   .",
    "extrapolating our 5    point down to 3    would give s / n@xmath67 - 22  @xmath4 .",
    "in general , at the spectral resolutions of the globular clusters in figure  [ fig12 ] , @xmath54  13 - 23   , our simulations indicate that a s / n  @xmath55  25  @xmath4 is required for a 20% age uncertainty and @xmath55  45  @xmath4 for a 10% uncertainty .",
    "this is higher than the s / n@xmath65  @xmath4 obtained from adding noise to actual cluster spectra .",
    "this discrepancy is not currently understood and will be investigated further in future work .",
    "in  [ line_ind ] we looked at the results of fits to specific regions of the spectrum around typically used line indices . here",
    "we test the broader effects of the regions blueward and redward of the 4000    break on derived ages and metallicities . this will be important for fitting galaxies at varying redshifts , since at z@xmath61 optical spectra typically reach just beyond the 4000    break in the galaxy s rest frame .",
    "for the clusters in our sample that include near ultraviolet spectra , we analyze the range of 3200 - 5650   , which is the maximum extent common to all clusters in this group . within this range ,",
    "we fit models to the blue ( @xmath56  4000   ) , the red ( @xmath57  4000   ) , and the region right around the break ( 3750 - 4250   , as defined in the empirical calibration of the break by @xcite ) .",
    "the clusters in this study are listed in table  [ red_blue_id ] with their ages derived from different parts of the spectrum .",
    "correlations of ages from the different spectral regions are plotted in figure  [ fig17 ]",
    ".    fits to different regions give different results . for cn spectrum",
    "fits , the red part of the spectrum drives the result .",
    "the red ages correlate with the ages from the entire spectrum and are slightly older than the values in the literature .",
    "the blue region gives younger ages than both the red region and the literature .",
    "ages from the break region correlate to the red ages with about the same amount of scatter as we saw in the red - entire spectrum correlation . since the continuum is normalized out for these fits , the break region is left with only the signatures of strong features like the ca h and k lines and h@xmath8 , similar to the d@xmath42(4000)-h@xmath8 analysis done by @xcite on sdss galaxies .",
    "the rough agreement of ages from this region with those from the entire spectrum emphasizes the importance for the 4000    break to be in the spectrum used for estimating the age of an object .",
    "the only correlation between [ fe / h ] is a weak one between the entire spectrum and the red spectrum ( not shown in figure [ fig17 ] ) , not surprising since most metallicity sensitive lines typically used are in the red part of the spectrum .    for full spectrum fits ,",
    "the trends change and the blue region carries more weight , demonstrating the importance of information in the continuum shape of the blue part of the spectrum .",
    "this is especially true for young objects with strong balmer discontinuities .",
    "ages from the blue and red regions agree , but with some scatter . however , now the entire spectrum agrees equally well with the blue and the red regions .",
    "the 4000    break ages agree much better with the blue than with the red ages .",
    "the red , blue , and break ages all correlate with the literature ages , but the correlation is tightest for the break region , even more so than for the full spectrum fits over the entire range .",
    "there is no correlation between our [ fe / h ] derived from the different regions , but the red [ fe / h ] has a weak correlation with the literature .    because of the importance of the continuum information blueward of the 4000    break",
    ", we also test hybrid fits that use the full spectrum over @xmath56  4250    and the cn spectrum over @xmath57  3750   .",
    "wavelengths below 4000    will not be affected by the tp - agb and carbon stars that dominate the near infrared , so as long as there are no continuum problems with the data this type of fit should be valid .",
    "we expected this approach to do better on very young objects .",
    "however , the hybrid fits match the full spectrum fits that used the entire wavelength range .",
    "the continuum shape dominates the fits and spreads out the age correlation with the literature for objects younger than @xmath60.1 gyr .",
    "this is the same problem seen earlier with the continua of very young clusters being redder than the models , causing older best - fitting ages .    in summary ,",
    "the continuum shape contains a lot of age information . in the blue part of the spectrum",
    "the continuum is more important than the lines for deriving age , while in the red part of the spectrum the lines alone are sufficient to derive the age .",
    "the most robust age estimates are obtained by using the entire cn spectrum of an object ( @xmath6 3200 - 8200   ) , but the 4000    break is an essential feature to be contained within that spectrum .",
    "when using cn spectra to avoid problems in model and data continua , ages from only the blue region are younger than those obtained by the red region or the entire range .",
    "age biases introduced by using different regions of the spectrum must be considered when combining objects that have different spectral coverage or different redshifts that change the rest frame wavelength coverage significantly .",
    "additionally , for objects that can not be considered a single stellar population , the ages determined from different spectral ranges may not be straighforward to interpret .",
    "nonetheless , near infrared spectra of high redshift galaxies will be important to provide rest frame wavelengths around and redward of the 4000    break , particularly when fitting their cn spectra .",
    "the effects of tp - agb stars on the near infrared luminosity of objects in which they reside have long been known and discussed by groups creating stellar population synthesis models @xcite .",
    "recent models by @xcite incorporate tp - agb stars through an empirical spectral library of c- and o - type stars by @xcite .",
    "the effects of these stars have been reanalyzed and calibrated on mc cluster colors in the new models .",
    "they show that over 80% of the k band light can be contributed by agb stars between the ages of 0.1 and 2  gyr for solar and lower metallicities .",
    "this effect is down to 20% in the v band .",
    "maraston fits photometric seds of these models to mc cluster seds .",
    "two objects in common with our sample , ngc  1783 and ngc  419 , show discrepancies between the maraston models that best fit the photometric seds and bc03 models that best fit the spectra .",
    "these inconsistencies are the very point being address by the new models , which show that younger ages may be obtained for objects that have a near infrared excess due to tp - agb stars if these stars are properly included",
    ". however , analysis of the spectra may reveal a different story .",
    "the cn spectra of the two clusters ( shown in figure  [ fig18]b ) are very similar to each other .",
    "ngc  1783 has d@xmath42(4000)=1.295 and ngc  419 has d@xmath42(4000)=1.246 .",
    "we derive similar ages for the two clusters by fitting their cn spectra : 1.5 gyr and [ fe / h]=@xmath20.8 for ngc  1783 , and 1.5 gyr and [ fe / h]=@xmath21.2 for ngc  419 .",
    "the maraston results for ngc  1783 are 0.3 gyr and [ fe / h]=@xmath20.33 , and for ngc  419 are 1 gyr and [ fe / h]=@xmath21.35 .",
    "bc03 models are overplotted on the cn spectra in figure  [ fig18]c , d for all the best - fitting models .",
    "the older age of 1.5 gyr is a better fit to the cn spectra of both clusters .",
    "our photometric fit age for ngc  1783 is 2.0 gyr and [ fe / h]=@xmath20.6 , and for ngc  419 is 20 gyr and [ fe / h]=@xmath21.4 .",
    "this much older photometric age for ngc  419 could be due to the presence of tp - agb stars making the continuum redder .",
    "the near infrared photometry of ngc  419 ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) does show an excess over best - fitting models to the spectra . it is likely that the bc03 models do not include the enough tp - agb stars in this case . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of agb stars was detected in ngc  1783 by @xcite , but apparently their inclusion in the bc03 models is sufficient for this case .",
    "we conclude that the detailed information contained in spectra is necessary for breaking degeneracies that can occur when using only broadband photometry through the near infrared . in a more recent paper @xcite",
    "apply the models with enhanced tp - agb stars to high redshift galaxies and find that some degeneracies , particularly between tp - agb stars and reddening due to dust , can be broken when mid - infrared photometry is added from spitzer .",
    "these new models look very promising for young objects if infrared data are available , however their spectral resolution is not high enough to fit to galaxy spectra .",
    "the ages expected for early - type galaxies at z@xmath61 fall within the range spanned by the globular clusters in this sample .",
    "the youngest early - type galaxies at these redshifts will likely be field galaxies that were the products of mergers . if the bulk of stars in these galaxies were formed in mergers at redshifts of z@xmath61.5 - 2 , which are the formation redshifts found for field ellipticals @xcite , they would be at least 1.5  gyr old by z@xmath61 ( for @xmath58  =  0.3 , @xmath59=0.7 , @xmath60=70 km s@xmath4mpc@xmath4 ) .",

    "our tests have shown that when using cn spectra , data to longer wavelengths will provide more robust age constraints .",
    "this means that near infrared spectra of galaxies will be important data to obtain for accurate age estimates .",
    "many early - type galaxies appear to have @xmath13-element abundance ratios enhanced above solar @xcite .",
    "this enhancement is a sign of short duration bursts of star formation that may well be typical for early - type galaxies formed during mergers , as we expect to find at z@xmath61 .",

    "we tested various techniques of fitting the models to data using spectra with and without their continua and photometry .",

    "the models are reliable in regions of parameter space where t@xmath610.1 gyr and [ fe / h ]  @xmath620.7 .",

    "clusters older than 1  gyr show a tighter correlation between ages derived from the cn spectrum and photometry fits .",
    "because the derived ages of young clusters are so strongly influenced by the continua and we have seen signs of problems in the models matching the cluster continua , we conclude that the best method for deriving accurate ages for globular clusters , especially when simultaneously determining metallicity , is fitting models to their continuum - normalized spectra .    on metallicities of clusters older than 1 gyr , we agree to 0.12  dex with the literature values that are based on spectra .",
    "those based on colors have much more scatter , which suggests that cn spectrum fits are more robust in estimating [ fe / h ] than methods using colors .",

    "redward of the break the lines alone in a continuum - normalized spectrum are sufficient to derive the age .",
    "many of the globular clusters tested here have spectra out to rest wavelengths of 1 @xmath3 m .",

    "it will be contained in typical z@xmath61 spectra , but higher redshifts may require near infrared spectra to correctly constrain ages and metallicites .",
    "we should note , however , that although a strong age indicator for globular clusters and early type galaxies , the 4000    break can be significantly affected by dust in star forming galaxies .",
