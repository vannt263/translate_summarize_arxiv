    "su(3 ) flavor symmetry has been very useful in classifying mesons and baryons .",
    "both the pseudoscalar ( @xmath18 ) and vector mesons ( @xmath19 ) clearly show the nonet structure expected for @xmath4 states , with masses following expectation .",
    "the same is not true for scalar mesons ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "in fact , instead of the expected 9 particles , 15 scalar mesons are observed below 2 gev as listed by the particle data group  @xcite , with masses not in accord with the @xmath4 model .",
    "the excess of particles can be explained by introducing non - conventional mesons such as glue balls , multi - quark states , or mesonic molecules .",
    "two possible non - conventional scalar mesons are the isoscalar @xmath3 and the isovector @xmath2 . these particles can be studied in the @xmath0 radiative decays @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the branching ratios for these processes strongly depend on the meson compositions : @xmath23@xmath24 for conventional @xmath4 mesons ; @xmath23@xmath25 for @xmath5 mesons ; @xmath26@xmath24 for @xmath6 molecules .",
    "the decays @xmath27 and @xmath28 contribute to the radiative decays @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively . however , other contributions to these decays come from @xmath31 with the @xmath32 decaying to @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and from @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath2 contributions are therefore extracted by fitting the @xmath36 and @xmath37 mass spectra .    the branching ratios and mass spectra ( figs .  [ f0 ] and  [ a0 ] ) for the decays @xmath29  @xcite and @xmath38  @xcite have been measured by the kloe collaboration using data collected in the year 2000 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath39 ( @xmath40 @xmath0 mesons ) .",

    "the purely theoretical spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "two different final states are selected for @xmath30 decays : @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",

    "assuming that electromagnetic interactions can be neglected , the amplitudes for @xmath87 decays can be written as :    @xmath88    where @xmath89 are the amplitudes to @xmath36 states with isospin 0 and 2 respectively .",
    "unitarity and cpt - invariance requires inclusion of the s - wave @xmath36 scattering phases  @xcite in eq .",
    "( [ isoampl ] ) . however , the value extracted from the previously measured branching ratios of kaon decays @xmath90 does not agree with the values obtained from @xmath36 scattering .",
    "for instance , the most recent evaluations are @xmath91  @xcite and @xmath92  @xcite .",
    "this disagreement is ascribed to two effects  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "the first is the presence of isospin breaking effects such as electromagnetic interactions . in presence of these effects",
    "the isospin amplitudes become  @xcite :    @xmath93    hence , the phase shift measured from kaon decays using eq .",
    "( [ isoampl ] ) , @xmath94 , differs from the @xmath36 phase shift difference by a factor @xmath95 :    @xmath96    an estimate of this difference is @xmath97  @xcite .",
    "the second is the uncertainty on what portion of the @xmath72 decay is included in the @xmath98 branching ratio .",
    "the last measurement of @xmath1 ratio was performed in 1976 with a 4.3% accuracy  @xcite and there is no information on the procedure used to handle the radiated photon .",
    "this uncertainty lead to a large error on the estimate of @xmath7 .",
    "the kloe collaboration measured this ratio using an integrated luminosity of @xmath99 collected during the year 2000 .",
    "the kloe measurement fully includes @xmath72 radiative decays  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 decays @xmath100 of the time into @xmath101 .",
    "the decay occurs nearly at rest and the two kaons are collinear .",
    "since the initial state is @xmath19 , the final state is always @xmath67 .",
    "this peculiarity allows us to select a pure @xmath102 beam by identifying a @xmath103 inside the detector ( @xmath102-tagging ) . while the @xmath102 has a decay length @xmath104 and decays close to the ip , the @xmath103 decay length is @xmath105 .",
    "hence about @xmath106 of the @xmath103 reach the calorimeter before decaying .",
    "the @xmath103 interaction in the calorimeter ( @xmath107 ) is identified by requiring a cluster not associated to any track , with energy above 200 mev , and velocity @xmath108 obtained by time - of - flight compatible with the kaon velocity @xmath109 .",
    "the @xmath107 is used to tag the @xmath102 .",
    "the correct measurement of the @xmath103 velocity ( @xmath110 ) requires the subtraction of the initial time of the event @xmath111 from the cluster times . due to the small bunch crossing period ,",
    "@xmath112 , the @xmath111 in kloe has to be determined event by event .",
    "a first estimate is obtained by assuming that the first cluster to arrive , with @xmath113 and distance to the beam line @xmath114 is due to a photon .",
    "this assumption , which is correct for @xmath115 but not for @xmath76 , leads to a different @xmath110 distribution for the two decay modes as shown in fig .",
    "[ kcref ] .",
    "therefore , different tagging efficiencies are obtained if @xmath107 cluster is selected by requiring @xmath116 .",
    "the correction is obtained by measuring the @xmath111-corrected distribution for @xmath76 from a control sample and comparing it with the uncorrected distribution .    to    @xmath115 events",
    "are selected by requiring at least 3 photons defined as clusters not associated to any track with @xmath117 .",
    "the background is rejected by cutting on energy and polar angle : @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "the distribution of the number of clusters in @xmath57 is shown in tab .",
    "[ tab:2pi0 ] .",
    "almost 90% of the events are retained .",

    "[ tracks ] .",
    "a peak due to charged kaons is visible at 100 mev in the data ( dots ) as well as a long tail at higher momentum due to residual background .",

    "the acceptance is shown in fig .  [ kpprad ] as a function of the photon energy .",
    "the value for @xmath123 is obtained from @xmath98 simulation , and for @xmath124 from @xmath125 simulation .",
    "the acceptance in the region @xmath126 is obtained by linear interpolation .",
    "the decrease in acceptance is due to the requirement that both pions reach the calorimeter . for high values of the photon energy the probability for both pions to reach the calorimeter is low .",
    "the overall acceptance is obtained by folding this efficiency with the photon spectrum from  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the radiated photon leads to a correction of @xmath127 .    to    in the data collected during the year 2000 we identify 1,060,821 @xmath76 and 766,308 @xmath115 events .",
    "the ratio of the branching ratios is obtained by correcting the ratio of these numbers with the acceptance and the tagging efficiencies .",
    "the result is :    @xmath128    this value is higher than the world average , @xmath129 , as we expect due to the inclusion of all the radiative decays .",
    "the error , @xmath130 , is dominated by systematics .",
    "the statistical error is already at the @xmath131 level .",
    "the main contribution to the systematic error comes from the correction for the different tagging efficiencies .",
    "the cut on @xmath110 was loosened in the year 2001 in order to reduce the contribution from this correction .",
    "using this new value , the phase shift is found to be :    @xmath132    which is now in agreement with the values extracted from @xmath36 scattering .",
    "the contribution of the electromagnetic interactions can be estimated from the difference between @xmath94 and @xmath133 .",
    "for instance , using the value in  @xcite :    @xmath134",
    "with the data collected during the year 2000 , the kloe collaboration has improved the previous existing measurements of branching ratios and mass spectra for @xmath0 radiative decays and the ratio @xmath135 .",
    "after two more years of data taking , the total integrated luminosity has increased by a factor of @xmath136 , allowing new and more precise measurements .",
    "preliminary results on radiative decays are in agreement with the previous ones .",
    "new analyses are also underway in order to study the dalitz plot for @xmath53 decays and the branching ratio and mass spectrum for @xmath137 decays in order to look for the @xmath138 intermediate state .",
    "the ratio @xmath135 has a statistical error which is already at per - mil level while the systematic error is @xmath139 .",
    "however , the higher statistics , together with the looser cut on the @xmath110 distribution should allow us to reduce the systematic error . with the expected @xmath140 fractional error",
