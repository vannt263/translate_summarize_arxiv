    "by the work of feit , gow , ohmori , turull , @xmath6 , one expects that the schur index of an irreducible character of a finite simple group is @xmath3 or  @xmath4 .",
    "this paper is a contribution to a solution of this problem , as far as the unipotent characters of a finite group of lie type are concerned . by lusztig @xcite ,",
    "the schur indices of all rational - valued unipotent characters are generally  @xmath3 .",
    "however , there are exceptions in the finite unitary groups ( ohmori @xcite ) and the ree groups @xmath7 ( @xcite ) where the schur indices are  @xmath4 . in @xcite",
    ", we were also able to compute the schur indices of some non - rational valued unipotent characters , but not all .",
    "this paper deals with some of the remaining cases , which arise in groups of type @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "our principal tool are kawanaka s generalized gelfand ",
    "graev characters @xcite .",
    "these are characters induced from certain unipotent subgroups .",
    "it is known that every unipotent character occurs with `` small '' multiplicity in such an induced character .",
    "we shall show here that certain generalized gelfand ",
    "graev representations can actually be realized over @xmath8 ( in type @xmath0 or @xmath2 ) or over a quadratic extension of @xmath8 ( in type @xmath1 ) .",
    "the method for doing this is inspired by ohmori @xcite , who considered the case of ordinary gelfand ",
    "graev representations . furthermore , using the explicit multiplicity formulas obtained by kawanaka @xcite and lusztig @xcite , we check that the unipotent characters that we wish to consider all occur with multiplicity  @xmath3 in those generalized gelfand  graev representations .    combining the previous work by ohmori , lusztig and the author with the results obtained in this paper ,",
    "the known results on schur indices of unipotent characters can be summarized as follows .",
    "let @xmath9 be a simple algebraic group and @xmath10 be an endomomorphism such that @xmath11 is a finite ( twisted or untwisted ) group of lie type .",
    "let @xmath12 be a unipotent irreducible character of @xmath11 .",
    "then the schur index of @xmath12 is given as follows .",
    "* assume that @xmath12 is cuspidal and rational - valued .",

    "assume that @xmath12 is cuspidal and not rational - valued .",
    "then the schur index of @xmath12 is  @xmath3 , except possibly for the two cuspidal unipotent characters in type @xmath1 ( where the schur index is at most @xmath4 ) or the two cuspidal unipotent characters with character field @xmath21 in type @xmath2 over a field of characterictic  @xmath22 ; see table  1 and corollary  1.5 in @xcite , and sections  [ mgsec2 ] , [ mgsec3 ] in the present paper .",
    "see gow @xcite , p.  119",
    ", for groups of type @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "* assume that @xmath12 is unipotent but not necessarily cuspidal .",
    "then @xmath12 occurs with non - zero multiplicity in the harish - chandra induction @xmath25 where @xmath26 is an @xmath27-stable levi complement in some @xmath27-stable proper parabolic subgroup of @xmath9 and @xmath28 is a cuspidal unipotent character of @xmath29 .",
    "in this situation , the schur index of @xmath12 equals that of @xmath28 ; see @xcite , proposition  5.6 .",
    "thus , there are two remaining cases to be dealt with :    * the characters @xmath30 $ ] in type @xmath1 ; * the characters @xmath31 $ ] for a group of type @xmath2 in characteristic  @xmath22 .    for each of these cases",
    ", we show that the determination of the schur index can be reduced to the problem of computing explicitly the values of certain induced characters .",

    "graev representations of a finite group of lie type can be realized over @xmath8 . for this purpose , we have to recall in some detail the construction of these representations .",
