    "the processes which influence the thermal transport of the quasiparticles ( qp ) under the application of a magnetic field and below the superconducting critical temperature are a matter of current research in the physics of high - temperature superconductors ( hts ) .",
    "one of the difficulties to obtain clear evidence for one or other mechanism from thermal conductivity measurements that involves the qp , is basically related to the separation of the qp contribution from the measured thermal conductivity . due to the fact that the experiments measure the total thermal conductivity given by the sum of the contributions due to phonons , @xmath12 , and to the qp , @xmath13",
    ", special methods are necessary to separate the relatively large phonon contribution to the thermal transport in hts .",
    "basically two methods for this separation have been treated in the literature .",
    "one method is based on a phenomenological description of the field dependence of the electronic contribution of the longitudinal thermal conductivity @xmath14 , introduced first by vinen et al .",
    "@xcite and used in refs .",
    "@xcite to estimate @xmath15 .",
    "the other method , presented by zeini et al .",
    "@xcite , is based on simultaneous measurements of the longitudinal and transverse thermal conductivity and the assumption of a field independent hall relaxation time .    to study thermal transport properties which depend on the qp contribution we have chosen to measure the thermal conductivity tensor as a function of angle @xmath3 between heat current direction and the magnetic field applied parallel to the cuo@xmath0 planes at different magnetic fields . because the oscillation amplitude of the thermal conductivities as a function of angle is related only to the qp contribution , most of our results are basically free from phonon contributions and can help to test scattering models for the qp . we discuss our results below in terms of two mechanisms that influence the behavior of qp in the mixed state of hts : andreev scattering ( as ) is currently discussed in the literature as possible scattering mechanism of qp @xcite and the doppler shift ( ds ) as the main effect that changes the energy spectrum of the qp with field @xcite .",
    "the influence of the scattering mechanism on the thermal properties depends also on the symmetry of the order parameter . in the last years",
    "a large number of measurements has confirmed the @xmath16wave pairing symmetry for most of the hts . due to",
    "the @xmath16wave symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in hts , extended quasiparticle states in the mixed state - associated with a gapless structure at the nodes - are expected to contribute to the thermal transport .",
    "these measurements have been described in terms of a ds in the energy spectrum of qp and the scattering of qp by vortices ( as ) taking into account the presence of line nodes on the fermi surface , i.e. , within a pure @xmath17-pairing symmetry @xcite .",
    "try - crystal phase - sensitive measurements @xcite have determined that the pairing symmetry of the order parameter is @xmath17 , which predominates with a small , if any , imaginary component ( @xmath18 ) @xmath19 at @xmath20 .",
    "although symmetry experiments should not be significantly affected by the development of a small @xmath21 contribution , the quasiparticle transport might show ( specially at @xmath22 ) quantitative differences from the single @xmath17-pairing state due to the absence of line nodes in the resulting superconducting @xmath23-gap .",
    "this new state proposed originally by laughlin @xcite could arise either by decreasing temperature or increasing magnetic field as argued in refs .",
    "@xcite . up to now , however , there is not enough experimental evidence for such a state although results on the magnetic field dependence of the longitudinal thermal conductivity in bscco @xcite and temperature dependence of the hall angle @xcite could be explained taking into account the violation of both parity and time - reversal symmetry . in this article",
    "we recover this idea and attempt to establish the highest value , if any , for a component @xmath19 of the superconducting order parameter within the current models for the thermal transport in the hts cuprates .",
    "our results agree with the @xmath17-pairing symmetry of the order parameter and provide a maximum value of @xmath24 for the component @xmath19 .    from the phenomenological side",
    "our work provides interesting details .",
    "namely , we show explicitly how the transverse thermal conductivity @xmath5 can be calculated from the experimental transverse temperature gradient @xmath25 and the longitudinal thermal conductivity @xmath4 for magnetic fields applied parallel to the cuo@xmath0 planes . as in the case of a perpendicular magnetic field",
    ", the resulting @xmath5 depends on the ratio of the transverse temperature gradient to the longitudinal one and represents a physical property of the crystal involving only contributions from the qp @xcite .",
    "we also show that the oscillation amplitude of the transverse thermal conductivity , @xmath7 , is larger than the longitudinal one , @xmath8 , in the whole magnetic field range studied ( 0",
    "t  @xmath26 t ) . from the extracted electronic contribution of @xmath4 we attempt also to calculate a hall - like angle and",
    "show that it increases with magnetic field in qualitatively agreement with the as model .",
    "our article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe some experimental and sample details ; in sec .",
    "[ res ] we describe and discuss our results and is divided in four subsections .",
    "a summary is presented in sec .",
    "for all the measurements presented here we used a twinned yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystal with dimensions ( length @xmath27 width @xmath28 thickness @xmath29 ) @xmath30mm@xmath31 and critical temperature @xmath32k , studied previously @xcite . with polarized light microscopy we have determined the positions of the twinning planes .",
    "accordingly , the heat current direction was adjusted along the @xmath33 axes which were parallel to the width or length of the sample . the use of a twinned crystal rules out the influence of orthorhombicity on the thermal transport properties studied in this work . in particular we can assume that @xmath34 . we note that the influence of the orthorhombicity can be observed in untwinned crystals only if the impurity scattering rate is small enough . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , untwinned crystals with relatively large impurity scattering show similar angle dependences as twinned ones .",
    "the longitudinal @xmath35 and transverse @xmath36 temperature gradients have been measured at @xmath37 with previously calibrated chromel - constantan ( type e ) thermocouples @xcite and a dc picovoltmeter .",
    "our definition of sample axes , temperature gradients and field direction is similar to that used in ref .",
    "if the heat current @xmath38 is along @xmath39 and a positive @xmath40 angle @xmath3 on the @xmath41-plane is along @xmath42 , then there is a positive transverse thermal gradient for the magnetic field @xmath43 at @xmath44 , see fig .",
    "[ arra ] .",
    "the magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the c - axis .",
    "special efforts were made in order to minimize the misalignment of the plane of rotation with the cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "we estimate the misalignment angle to be smaller than @xmath45 .",
    "an in - situ rotation system enabled us the measurement of the thermal conductivity as a function of the angle @xmath3 defined between the applied field and the heat flow direction along @xmath46 , see fig .",
    "we used an initial temperature gradient @xmath47k / m ( @xmath48  mk for our crystal ) at @xmath49 , i.e. with the magnetic field perpendicular to the heat flow , and we recorded angle scans and magnetic field dependence with a field - cooled procedure to avoid pinning effects @xcite .",
    "that means that the angle and magnetic field scans at constant temperature were done in such a way that after taking a reading the sample was driven to its normal state by heating up to a few kelvin above the superconducting critical temperature and immediately was cooled down again to 13.8 k at constant field .",
    "we will show in sec .",
    "[ pin ] experimental evidence that demonstrates how pinning of vortices influences the field dependence of the measured oscillations , even for the case of parallel field used in this work .    the possible influence of demagnetization and flux pinning effects associated with the rectangular shape of the sample , see the comment and reply in ref .",
    "@xcite , has been checked by aubin et al .",
    "the authors concluded that the relative orientation of vortices and the heat current , and not the sample geometry , governs the angle dependence . in our case , due to the relative large applied fields in comparison with the lower critical field @xmath50 and the field - cooled procedure ,",
    "an influence of the magnetization and flux pinning on the angle dependences can be excluded .",
    "figure [ angle1 ] shows the field - angle dependence of the temperature gradient @xmath51 at 13.8 k for 8 t and 3 t . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite the longitudinal thermal conductivity @xmath52 and hence , the longitudinal temperature gradient , shows fourfold symmetry with minima ( maxima for the thermal conductivity ) along the nodal directions of the superconducting gap , see fig .",
    "[ kxxkxy](a ) .",
    "we note that this effect represents a strong evidence for the @xmath17-pairing symmetry of the order parameter , confirming the presence of a large number of quasiparticles at those particular orientations .    the curves in fig .",
    "[ angle1 ] can be fitted satisfactorily with the simple function @xmath53 with only @xmath54 as fit parameter which depends on temperature and magnetic field .",
    "the fact that minima are found in the field - angle profile of the temperature gradient @xmath51 at the nodal directions could be explained in terms of andreev scattering of qp by vortices . according to this effect if at any point the quasiparticle energy , as viewed from the superfluid frame",
    ", equals the gap then , at that point , andreev reflection occurs : the quasiparticle is converted to a quasihole reversing its velocity and its contribution to the heat transport @xcite .",
    "this mechanism of thermal resistance is always induced when spatial variations of the amplitude or phase of the order parameter take place .",
    "since the qp in the mixed state are in the presence of a phase gradient ( superfluid flow ) they should also have a ds in their energy spectrum given by the scalar product of the momentum and superfluid velocity , @xmath55 as viewed from the laboratory frame .",
    "that phase gradient is then the necessary mechanism that induces the andreev reflection .",
    "thus , when a quasiparticle with momentum * p * is moving parallel to the magnetic field no ds occurs and hence , no andreev reflection",
    ". in other words , the field acts as a filter @xcite for that quasiparticle that contributes to reduce the total temperature gradient . for different orientations of the quasiparticle momentum with the field",
    ", there is a finite probability for the andreev reflection and thereby , for an enhancement of the thermal resistance .",
    "the directionality of this scattering mechanism is therefore the responsible feature for the identification of the preferential directions of the qp by rotating the magnetic field parallel to the basal planes .    on the other hand",
    ", a ds in the energy spectrum of the quasiparticle could also give rise to fourfold symmetry in the longitudinal thermal conductivity by rotating the field parallel to the cuo@xmath0 planes , but in principle , with opposite sign .",
    "the usual effect would be to produce an excess of quasiparticles in the direction perpendicular to the field , and thereby , reducing the thermal resistance in that direction @xcite .",
    "however , the ds affects both the carrier density as well as the scattering rate of qp , and since the latter dominates at high enough temperatures the qp move easier parallel to the field and the sign turns out to the correct one @xcite .",
    "we note that , although it is not clear which effect ( as or ds ) should prevail at low fields , the quasiparticle mean free path shortens with increasing field as might be expected if the vortex are moving closer together and therefore , as should dominate the heat transport at high enough fields .    in fig .",
    "[ angle2 ] we show the field - angle dependence of the transverse temperature gradient @xmath56 at two magnetic fields .",
    "we note that the sign of this effect is just that expected within the pure as picture , i.e. , the qp with momentum parallel to the magnetic field does not suffer andreev reflection , and therefore , enhances the transverse temperature gradient in that direction . in other words",
    ", the temperature of a side of the sample is enhanced when the field is oriented to that side . as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite and since the transverse signal is expected to be free of non - electronic contributions in contrast to the longitudinal temperature gradient , this fact could be definitive in distinguishing between andreev reflection and ds . however , the inclusion of an impurity scattering rate in the calculations of the ds effect accounts for the sign of both fourfold and twofold oscillations as well @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the case of bscco it has been argued that at the range of magnetic field and temperature studied here , both effects are taking place , and depending on the values of the parameters governing the gap at the nodes , i.e , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , along with an impurity scattering rate @xmath59 , different regimes in which ds dominates over andreev scattering or vice versa , could be identified @xcite . unfortunately , there is no yet theory for both longitudinal and transverse thermal conductivities which takes into account both effects when the field is oriented parallel to the cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "also , the theory for the thermal transport for our case ( i.e. parallel field , low temperatures and finite impurity scattering ) under the influence of ds is still not yet developed .",
    "therefore , in most of this paper we restrict ourselves to a quantitative comparison of our experimental results to the predictions obtained from the as mechanism ; deviations from the predictions may well indicate that the other mechanism could influence the thermal transport , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for a better comparison with theoretical predictions",
    "we need to obtain the transverse thermal conductivity from the measured transverse temperature gradient . as in the case the field",
    "is applied normal to the basal planes , we calculate the transverse thermal conductivity , @xmath5 as a function of the field angle @xmath3 from the onsager relations , using the fact that the net heat current flowing in the @xmath60-direction is zero . at constant temperature , this can be written as follows : @xmath61 where we have used the experimental fact that the total longitudinal temperature gradient ( @xmath62 k / m ) is much larger than its fourfold oscillation ( @xmath63 k / m ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ angle1 ] .",
    "this allows us to approximate @xmath64 in ( [ kxy ] ) and thereby , the fourfold symmetry does not enter when calculating @xmath5 .",
    "in other words , the transverse thermal conductivity has the same symmetry as the transverse temperature gradient but opposite sign .",
    "we note that ( [ kxy ] ) ensures us that @xmath5 measures in fact a physical properties of the crystal as in the usual righi - leduc effect .",
    "figure  [ kxxkxy](b ) shows the angle dependence of the transverse thermal conductivity at two different magnetic fields .      in order to separate the phonon and quasiparticle contributions from the longitudinal thermal conductivity , needed for a quantitative comparison with the as model",
    ", we have measured the field dependence up to 9 t with the field oriented along both antinodes and nodes directions . as shown in fig .",
    "[ bdepen ] the field profile can be rather well fitted with the empirical expression @xcite @xmath65 where , in general , @xmath66 is proportional to the zero - field electronic mean - free - path of the qp and @xmath67 can be related to the nature of the quasiparticle scattering @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the phononic and electronic contributions _ at zero field _ , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , are independent of the angle @xmath3 .",
    "further , we assume that @xmath66 remains unchanged by rotating the field parallel to the cuo@xmath0 planes at constant temperature . in this case",
    "the exponent @xmath67 might be field - angle dependent due to the different types of _ effective _ scattering which the qp experience at different orientations of the magnetic field .",
    "this assumption remains thereby valid either when the main effect is the ds or the as . as in ref .",
    "@xcite we used the value @xmath70 , when the field was aligned parallel to the direction of the measured temperature gradient ( parallel to the heat current , @xmath71 ) and it was allowed to take other values for different orientations of the field . as shown in fig .",

    "the field - angle dependence measurements show the predominance of the @xmath17-wave pairing symmetry over a complex component @xmath19 , which is estimated to be less than @xmath156 of the resulting total gap , within the as picture for the interaction of qp with vortices .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the amplitude coefficients of the fourfold and twofold oscillations observed in @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , allows us to define magnitudes free of contributions from the phonons and , hence , suitable for comparison with theory .",
    "in particular , the dependence of the amplitude coefficients @xmath7 and @xmath8 , their ratio , a hall - like angle @xmath147 and the ratio @xmath86 between the decrease of the longitudinal thermal conductivity and the transverse thermal conductivity with field were obtained . assuming only the as mechanism along with an impurity scattering rate , we get a good quantitative description of both field dependences of the oscillation amplitude of the conductivities only if we increase the intervortex spacing five times ( or increase the parallel critical field to 9500  t ) the value defined in ref .",
    "this implies a much smaller scattering rate due to as than the one obtained from the original theory .",
    "also , the as model does not fit with the same parameters all the experimental data , although it provides a good qualitative description of the field and angle dependences of all the parameters .",
    "the less developed ds model does not allow a rigorous quantitative comparison .",
    "it is worth to mention , however , that the ds model alone also provides field dependences of the oscillation amplitudes similar to those obtained experimentally .",
    "an impurity scattering rate should be introduced in the ds theory within a more realistic limit than the superclean limit to perform a detailed discussion of the quantities involved in the equations .",
    "the overall results suggest that both as and ds effects are responsible for the observed magnetic field dependencies but with different regimes of predominance . as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite it is more likely that the ds plays an important role at low fields providing a slower magnetic field dependence in the components of the thermal conductivity tensor than the as .",
    "this can be understood taking into account that while the qp always suffer a ds in the mixed state , the probability for andreev reflection increases with increasing field .",
    "this might explain the less abrupt decrease with field of the ratio @xmath140 below @xmath141 t and the observed quantitative discrepancies between the hall - like angle @xmath147 , the parameter @xmath86 and the as model .",
    "further development of the theory involving both mechanisms is necessary to confirm this hypothesis .",
