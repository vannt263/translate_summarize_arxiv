    "a classical theorem of vizing  @xcite asserts that the _ chromatic index _ of every cubic bridgeless graph , i.e. , the smallest number of colors needed to properly edge - color such a graph , is @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "cubic cyclically @xmath3-edge - connected graphs with chromatic index @xmath3 are known as _",
    "snarks _ and it is known that smallest counter - examples , if any , to several deep open conjectures in graph theory , such as the cycle double cover conjecture , must be snarks .",
    "our research is motivated by edge - colorings of cubic bridgeless graphs with no short cycles .",
    "the girth conjecture of jaeger and swart  @xcite asserted that there are no snarks with large girth .",
    "this conjecture was refuted by kochol  @xcite who constructed snarks of arbitrary large girth .",
    "hence , it is natural to ask whether it can be said that snarks of large girth are close to being @xmath2-edge - colorable in some sense .",
    "one of the relaxations of ordinary colorings are circular colorings , introduced by vince  @xcite . a _ @xmath4-coloring _ of a graph @xmath5 is a coloring of vertices with colors from the set @xmath6 such that any two adjacent vertices receive colors @xmath7 and @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "circular colorings naturally appear in different settings , which is witnessed by several equivalent definitions of this notion as exposed in the surveys by zhu  @xcite .",
    "the infimum of the ratios @xmath10 such that @xmath5 has a @xmath4-coloring is the _ circular chromatic number _ of @xmath5 .",
    "it is known that the infimum is the minimum for all finite graphs and the ceiling of the circular chromatic number of a graph is equal to its chromatic number .",
    "thus , the circular chromatic number is a fractional relaxation of the chromatic number .",
    "the _ circular chromatic index _ of a graph is the circular chromatic number of its line - graph .",
    "zhu  @xcite asked whether there exist snarks with circular chromatic index close or equal to @xmath3 , and as there are snarks with arbitrary large girth , it is also interesting to know whether there exist such snarks of arbitrary large girth .",
    "afshani et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the circular chromatic index of every cubic bridgeless graph is at most @xmath11 and kaiser et al .",
    "@xcite showed that for every @xmath12 , there exists @xmath13 such that every cubic bridgeless graph with girth at least @xmath13 has circular chromatic index at most @xmath14 .",
    "this latter result was generalized to graphs with bounded maximum degree  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the circular chromatic indices of several well - known classes of snarks have been determined  @xcite .",
    "the petersen graph is the only cubic bridgeless graph that is known to have the circular chromatic index equal to @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , it is the only example of a cubic bridgeless graph with circular chromatic index greater than @xmath1 .",
    "this leads to the following ( wild ) conjecture .",
    "[ conj ] every cubic bridgeless graph different from the petersen graph has circular chromatic index strictly less than @xmath11 , maybe , at most @xmath1 .    in their paper ,",
    "kaiser et al .",
    "@xcite , formulated a problem to determine the smallest girth @xmath15 such that every cubic bridgeless graph with girth at least @xmath15 has circular chromatic index at most @xmath1 , and they showed that @xmath16 .",
    "note that @xmath17 because of the petersen graph . in this paper , we prove that every cubic bridgeless graph having a @xmath18-factor composed of cycles of length different from @xmath2 and @xmath19 has circular chromatic index at most @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that @xmath20 , i.e. , the circular chromatic index of every cubic bridgeless graph with girth at least @xmath21 is at most @xmath1 .",
    "our result also applies to subcubic graphs with odd - girth at least @xmath0 .",
    "the core of our argument is formed by decomposing the graph obtained by contracting a @xmath18-factor of a cubic bridgeless graph into trails .",
    "we first introduce notation related to such decompositions and then prove their existence .",
    "an _ _ is a graph with multiple edges , loops and half - edges allowed with a fixed cyclic ordering of the ends around each vertex .",
    "formally , an @xmath22 is comprised of a vertex - set @xmath23 and an edge - set @xmath24 .",
    "each edge has two ends : one of them is incident with a vertex , and the other may , but need not , be incident with a vertex .",
    "an edge that has exactly one end incident with a vertex is a _ half - edge_. an edge with both ends incident with the same vertex is a _",
    "loop_. the _ degree _ @xmath25 of a vertex @xmath26 is the number of ends incident with @xmath27 ( in particular , loops are counted twice ) .",
    "moreover , for each vertex , there is a cyclic ordering of the ends incident with it .",
    "these orderings are represented by a surjective mapping @xmath28 such that @xmath29 is an edge incident with @xmath27 and @xmath30 for every @xmath31 .",
    "an edge has two pre - images in @xmath32 if and only if it is a loop incident with @xmath27 .",
    "an naturally yields an embedding of the corresponding multi - graph on a surface .    _ deleting a vertex @xmath26 _ from an @xmath33 yields an @xmath34 with @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 being the restriction of @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "in other words , the vertex @xmath27 and half - edges and loops incident with @xmath27 are removed . the other edges incident with @xmath27 become half - edges .",
    "a _ trail _ in an is a sequence of mutually distinct edges @xmath40 such that    * @xmath41 and @xmath42 have a common end - vertex @xmath43 , for @xmath44 ; and * @xmath45 unless @xmath46 is a loop , for @xmath47 .",
    "if @xmath48 is not a half - edge , then the trail _ starts at a vertex_. similarly , if @xmath49 is not a half - edge , the trail _ ends at a vertex_. furthermore , a trail that consists of a single half - edge either starts or ends at a vertex . for a given trail",
    ", a linear ordering on its edges is naturally defined .",
    "let @xmath50 and @xmath51 be two edge - disjoint trails and @xmath27 a vertex . if @xmath50 ends at @xmath27 and @xmath51 starts at @xmath27 , then we can _ link _ the two trails by identifying the end of @xmath50 with the beginning of @xmath51 : thereby , we obtain a new trail that first follows the edges of @xmath50 and then those of @xmath51 .",
    "we also define the linking of a trail @xmath52 that starts and ends at the same vertex with itself : in this case , we obtain the same trail @xmath52 except that the ordering of the edges becomes cyclic . a trail obtained in this way",
    "closed_. trails that are not closed are _",
    "open_. note that a trail that starts and ends at the same vertex can be either open or closed .",
    "trails @xmath53 form a",
    "_ compatible decomposition _ of an @xmath5 if all of them are open , every edge is contained in exactly one of the trails and for every vertex @xmath27 of odd degree of @xmath5 , there is an index @xmath54 such that the following pairs of edges are consecutive ( regardless of their order ) in some of the trails ( and thus are not the same edge ) :    * @xmath55 and @xmath56 ; * @xmath57 and @xmath58 ; and * @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "note that if an @xmath5 has a compatible decomposition , then it has no vertices of degree @xmath61 or @xmath19 .",
    "we now prove that every with no vertices of degree @xmath61 , @xmath2 or @xmath19 has a compatible decomposition . in the next two lemmas , which form the base of our inductive argument , with a single vertex",
    "are analyzed .",
    "[ lm-7 ] every @xmath5 that has a single vertex and the degree of this vertex is @xmath0 has a compatible decomposition .",
    "let @xmath27 be the vertex and let @xmath46 be the image of @xmath62 for each @xmath63 .",
    "further , let @xmath64 be the set of trails obtained by the following process : initially , each edge of @xmath5 forms a single trail .",
    "we then link the two trails starting or ending with @xmath46 and @xmath65 , next we link the two trails starting or ending with @xmath42 and @xmath66 , and last the two trails starting or ending with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this operation does not always yield a compatible decomposition , since it may create closed trails .",
    "for instance , @xmath64 contains a closed trail if @xmath69 , or if @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( in this last case , after having linked @xmath42 with @xmath66 , thereby obtaining a trail @xmath52 , the last linking amounts to linking @xmath52 with itself ) . on the other hand , if all the obtained trails are open , then @xmath64 is a compatible decomposition , with @xmath72 being the index @xmath54 of the definition .",
    "our goal is to show that at least one of the sets @xmath64 is composed only of open trails .",
    "since the degree of @xmath27 is odd , the vertex @xmath27 is incident with at least one half - edge . by symmetry",
    ", we assume that this half - edge is @xmath73 .",
    "if @xmath74 contains a closed trail , then one of the following four cases applies ( recall that @xmath73 is a half - edge ) :    * @xmath75 , * @xmath76 , * @xmath77 and @xmath78 , or * @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath81 contains a closed trail , then one of the following four cases applies :    * @xmath82 , * @xmath76 , * @xmath83 and @xmath84 , or * @xmath85 and @xmath86 .    comparing the two sets of four possible cases ,",
    "we conclude that if none of @xmath74 and @xmath81 is compatible , then at least one of the following six cases applies ( these cases are referred to as _",

    "in the first case , the set @xmath87 contains only open trails . in the last four cases ,",
    "the sets @xmath88 , @xmath87 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively , are composed of open trails ( see figure  [ fig-7-a ] for an illustration ) .",
    "we now focus on the second case . if @xmath87 contains a closed trail ( and @xmath76 ) , it holds that @xmath91 .",
    "however , in this case , the set @xmath88 contains no closed trails ( see figure  [ fig-7-b ] ) .",
    "this finishes the proof of the lemma .",

    "further , if @xmath88 contains a closed trail , then @xmath109 .",
    "again , the set @xmath107 is then a compatible decomposition ( see figure  [ fig - single - c ] ) .    to summarize",
    ", we have shown that at least one of the sets @xmath64 , @xmath110 , is composed of open trails only , and thus it forms a compatible decomposition .",
