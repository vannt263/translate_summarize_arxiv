    "it is believed that the orbital architecture of the solar system was significantly altered from its initial state after the dissipation of the protosolar nebula .",
    "the present architecture is probably a result of complex dynamical interaction between planets , and between planets and planetesimals left behind by planet formation .",
    "this becomes apparent because much of what we see in the solar system today can be explained if planets radially migrated , and/or if they evolved through a dynamical instability and reconfigured to a new state ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", we use this framework to investigate the behavior of jupiter s and saturn s obliquities .",
    "the obliquity , @xmath2 , is the angle between the spin axis of a planet and the normal to its orbital plane .",
    "the core accretion theory applied to jupiter and saturn implies that their primordial obliquities should be very small .",
    "this is because the angular momentum of the rotation of these planets is contained almost entirely in their massive hydrogen and helium envelopes .",
    "the stochastic accretion of solid cores should therefore be irrelevant for their current obliquity values ( see lissauer & safronov 1991 for a discussion ) , and a symmetric inflow of gas on forming planets should lead to @xmath3 .",
    "the present obliquity of jupiter is @xmath4 , which is small , but not quite small enough for these expectations , but that of saturn is @xmath5 , which is clearly not .",
    "@xcite and @xcite noted that the precession frequency of saturn s spin axis has a value close to @xmath6 arcsec yr@xmath7 , where @xmath1 is the mean nodal regression of neptune s orbit ( or , equivalently , the eighth nodal eigenfrequency of the planetary system ; e.g. , applegate et  al .",
    "1986 ; laskar 1988 ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite pointed out that the precession frequency of jupiter s spin axis has a value close to @xmath8 arcsec yr@xmath7 , where @xmath0 is the mean nodal regression of uranus s orbit .",
    "these findings are significant because they raise the possibility that the current obliquities of jupiter and saturn have something to do with the precession of the giant planet orbits .",
    "specifically , @xcite and @xcite suggested that the present value of saturn s obliquity can be explained by capture of saturn s spin vector in a resonance with @xmath1 .",
    "they proposed that the capture occurred when saturn s spin vector precession increased as a result of saturn s cooling and contraction , or because @xmath1 decreased during the depletion of the primordial kuiper belt .",
    "they showed that , if the post - capture evolution is conveniently slow , the spin - orbit resonance ( also known as the cassini resonance , see section 2 ) is capable of increasing saturn s obliquity to its current value .",
    "while changes of precession or @xmath1 during the earliest epochs could have been important , it seems more likely that capture in the spin - orbit resonance occurred later , probably as a result of planetary migration @xcite .",
    "this is because both @xmath0 and @xmath1 significantly change during the instability and subsequent migration . therefore ,",
    "if the spin - orbit resonances had been established earlier , they would not survive to the present time .",
    "@xcite studied various scenarios for resonant tilting of saturn s spin axis during the planetary migration and found that the present obliquity of saturn can be explained only if the characteristic migration time scale was long and/or if neptune s inclination was substantially excited during the instability . since neptune inclination is never large in the instability / migration models of nesvorn & morbidelli ( 2012 ; hereafter nm12 ) , typically @xmath9 , the migration timescales presumably need ( note that @xcite did not investigated these low-@xmath10 cases in detail ) to be _ very _ long ( see section  3.3 ) .",
    "interestingly , these very long migration timescales are also required from other constraints ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they could be achieved in the @xcite models if neptune interacted with an already depleted planetesimal disk during the very last stages of the migration process . as for the obliquity of jupiter , @xcite suggested that the present value is due to the proximity of the spin precession rate to the @xmath0 frequency .",
    "in fact , the obliquities of jupiter and saturn represent a much stronger constraint on the instability / migration models than was realized before .",
    "this is because the constraints from the present obliquities of jupiter and saturn must be satisfied _ simultaneously _ ( mcneil & lee 2010 ; brasser & lee 2015 ) .",
    "for example , in the initial configuration of planets in the nm12 models , the @xmath1 frequency is much faster than the precession constants of both jupiter and saturn .",
    "this means that the @xmath1 mode , before approaching saturn s precession frequency and exciting its obliquity , must also have evolved over the precession frequency of jupiter s spin vector .",
    "this leads to a conundrum , because if the crossing were slow , jupiter s obliquity would increase as a result of capture into the spin - orbit resonance with @xmath1 .",
    "if , on the other hand , the general evolution at all stages were fast , the conditions for capture of saturn into the spin - orbit resonance with @xmath1 may not be be met ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and saturn s obliquity would stay small .",
    "a potential solution of this problem would be to invoke fast evolution of @xmath1 early on , during the crossing of jupiter s precession frequency , and slow evolution of @xmath1 later on , such that saturn s spin vector can be captured into the spin - orbit resonance with @xmath1 during the late stages .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , if the migration of the outer planets was faster before the instability , and slowed down later , as the outer solar system progressed toward a more relaxed state . as we show in section 3.1",

    ", @xcite determined that jupiter s @xmath35 is somewhere in the range between @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( here rescaled for the equatorial radius @xmath38  km of the planet ) .",

    "this difference has been noted and discussed in @xcite .",

    "this is because mutual planetary interactions make their orbits precess in space on a characteristic timescale of tens of thousands of years and longer .",

    "the two stages are considered separately in sections  3.2 and 3.3 .",
    "nm12 reported the results of nearly @xmath112 numerical integrations of planetary instability , starting from hundreds of different initial configurations of planets that were obtained from previous hydrodynamical and @xmath113-body calculations .",
    "the initial configurations with the 3:2 jupiter - saturn mean motion resonance were given special attention , because jupiter and saturn , radially migrating in the gas disk before its dispersal , should have become trapped into their mutual 3:2 resonance ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they considered cases with four , five and six initial planets , where the additional planets were placed onto resonant orbits between saturn and the inner ice giant , or beyond the orbit of the outer ice giant .",

    "experimented with different disk masses , density profiles , instability triggers , etc .",
    ", in an attempt to find solutions that satisfy several constraints , such as the orbital configuration of the outer planets , survival of the terrestrial planet , and the distribution of orbits in the asteroid belt .",
    "nm12 found the dynamical evolution in the four planet case was typically too violent if jupiter and saturn start in the 3:2 resonance , leading to ejection of at least one ice giant from the solar system .",
    "planet ejection can be avoided if the mass of the transplanetary disk of planetesimals was large ( @xmath114 @xmath115 , where @xmath115 is the earth mass ) , but such a massive disk would lead to excessive dynamical damping ( e.g. , the outer planet orbits become more circular then they are in reality ) and to smooth migration that violates constraints from the survival of the terrestrial planets , and the asteroid belt .",
    "better results were obtained when the solar system was assumed to have five giant planets initially and one ice giant , with mass comparable to that of uranus or neptune , was ejected into interstellar space by jupiter @xcite .",
    "the best results were obtained when the ejected planet was placed into the external 3:2 or 4:3 resonances with saturn and @xmath116  @xmath115 .",
    "the range of possible outcomes was rather broad in this case , indicating that the present solar system is neither a typical nor expected result for a given initial state .",
    "the most relevant feature of the nm12 models for this work is that the planetary migration happens in two stages ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . during the first stage , that is",
    "before the instability happens , neptune migrates into the outer disk at @xmath117  au .",
    "the migration is relatively fast during this stage , because the outer disk still has a relatively large mass .",
    "we analyzed several simulations from nm12 and found that neptune s migration can be approximately described by an exponential with the e - folding timescale @xmath118  myr for @xmath119 @xmath115 and @xmath120 myr for @xmath121 @xmath115 .",
    "the instability typically happens in the nm12 models when neptune reaches @xmath122  au . the main characteristic of the instability is that planetary encounters occur , mainly between the extra ice giant and all other planets .",
    "the instability typically lasts @xmath123 years and terminates when the extra ice giant is ejected from the solar system by jupiter .",
    "the second stage of migration starts after that .",
    "the migration of neptune is much slower during this period , because the outer disk is now very much depleted . from simulations in nm12",
    "we find that @xmath124  myr for @xmath119 @xmath115 and @xmath125  myr for @xmath121 @xmath115 .",
    "moreover , rather then being precisely exponential , the migration slows down relative to an exponential with fixed @xmath126 , such as , effectively , the very late stages have larger @xmath126 values ( @xmath127  myr ) than the ones immediately following the instability .",
    "uranus accompanies the migration of neptune on timescales similar to those mentioned above .    the frequencies @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which are the most relevant for this work , are initially somewhat higher than the precession constants of jupiter and saturn , mainly because of the torques from the outer disk .",
    "the extra term from the third ice giant initially located at @xmath128  au has much faster frequency then the precession constants and does not interfere with the obliquity of jupiter and saturn during the subsequent evolution .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 frequencies slowly decrease during both stages .",
    "their e - folding timescales may slightly differ from the migration e - folding timescales mentioned above , due to the non - linearity of the dependence of the secular frequencies on the semimajor axis of planets .",
    "our tests show that they are about @xmath129% of the e - folding timescales of planetary semimajor axes .    from analyzing the behavior of frequencies in different simulations we found that @xmath1 should cross the value of jupiter s precession constant during the first migration stage , that is _ before _ the instability .",
    "the main characteristic of this crossing is that the planetary orbits are very nearly coplanar during this stage . the amplitude @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ ham3 ] ) should thus be very small .",
    "it is not known exactly , however , how small . in section  3.2 , we consider amplitudes down to @xmath130 ( about @xmath131 times smaller than the present value of @xmath132 , where @xmath132 is the amplitude of the @xmath133th frequency term in jupiter s orbit ) , and show that the effects on jupiter s obliquity are negligible if the amplitudes were even lower .",
    "the second characteristic of the first migration stage is that the evolution of @xmath1 happens on a characteristic timescale of @xmath134  myr .",
    "since the total change of @xmath1 during this interval is several arcsec  yr@xmath7 , and the first stage typically lasts @xmath135  myr , the average rate of change is very roughly , as an order of magnitude estimate , @xmath136 arcsec  yr@xmath7  myr@xmath7 .",
    "the actual value of @xmath137 during crossing depends on several unknowns , including when exactly the crossing happens during the first stage . also , the changes of @xmath1 could have been slower if the first stage lasted longer than in the nm12 simulations , as required if the instability occurred at the time of the late heavy bombardment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "interesting effects on obliquities should happen during the second migration stage .",
    "first , the @xmath1 frequency reaches the value of the precession constant of saturn .",
    "there are several differences with respect to the @xmath1 crossing of jupiter s precession constant during the first stage ( discussed above ) .",
    "the orbital inclinations of planets were presumably excited to their current values during the instability .",
    "therefore , the amplitude @xmath141 should be comparable to its current value , @xmath142 , during the second stage .",
    "we see this happening in the nm12 simulations .",
    "first , there is a brief period during the instability , when the inclinations of all planets are excited by encounters with the ejected ice giant .",
    "the inclination of neptune is modest , at most @xmath143 , and is rather quickly damped by the planetesimal disk . also , the invariant plane of the solar system changes by @xmath144 when the third ice giant is ejected during the instability .",
    "the final inclinations are of this order .",
    "the current amplitudes are @xmath145 ( @xmath1 term in jupiter s orbit ) and @xmath146 ( @xmath1 term in saturn s orbit ) ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another difference with respect the first stage is that the evolution of @xmath1 is much slower during the second stage .",
    "if , as indicated by the nm12 integration , @xmath1 changes by @xmath147  arcsec  yr@xmath7 in @xmath148  myr , then the average rate of change is very roughly @xmath149 arcsec  yr@xmath7  myr@xmath7 .",
    "the actual rate of change can be considerably lower than this during the very late times , when the effective @xmath126 was lower than during the initial stages . finally , during the very last gasp of migration",
    ", the @xmath0 frequency should have approached the precession constant of jupiter .",
    "we study this case in an adiabatic approximation when the rate of change of @xmath0 is much slower than any other relevant timescale .",
    "we find that the present obliquity of jupiter can be excited by the interaction with the @xmath0 term only if the precession constant of jupiter is somewhat larger than inferred by @xcite , in accord with the results of @xcite .",
    "since @xmath1 remains larger than @xmath43 during the first stage , we do not expect any important effects on saturn s obliquity during this stage .",
    "if saturn s obliquity was low initially , it should have remained low in all times before the instability .",
    "we therefore focus on the case of jupiter in this section . from the analysis of the nm12 numerical simulation in section  3.1",
    ", we infer that the @xmath1 frequency crossed @xmath39 during the first stage .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggested a possibility that jupiter s present obliquity may be explained by the proximity of @xmath39 to the current value of the @xmath0 frequency .",

    "to test this possibility we run a suite of simulations , assuming an exponential convergence to the current value @xmath61  arcsec yr@xmath7 .",

    "given that the planetary migration is slow during the second stage , we chose @xmath167  myr .",
    "this assures that the approach of @xmath168 to @xmath39 is adiabatical .",

    "this case would imply that jupiter s present obliquity had to be acquired during the earlier stages and is possibly related to the non - adiabatic @xmath1 resonance crossing discussed in section  3.2 . if , on the other hand , @xmath175  arcsec yr@xmath7 , jupiter would owe its present obliquity to the proximity between @xmath39 and @xmath0 .",
    "this would imply that the obliquity excitation during the first stage of planetary migration must have been minimal .",
    "figures  [ fig3 ] and [ fig5 ] express the joint constraint on the planetary migration also for the intermediate cases , where the present obliquity of jupiter arose as a combination of both effects discussed here .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] illustrates the two limiting cases discussed above . in panel ( a ) , we assumed that the parameters during the first migration stage were such that the obliquity of jupiter was excited to its current value during the @xmath1 crossing ( such as shown in fig .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to study this possibility , we assume that the @xmath141 amplitude was excited to its current value during the instability , and remained nearly constant during the second stage of planetary migration .",
    "this choice is motivated by the nm12 simulations , where the inclination of neptune is never too large .",
    "note that @xcite investigated the opposite case where neptune s inclination was substantially excited during the instability and remained high when the resonance with @xmath1 occurred .",
    "this type of strong inclination excitation does not happen in the nm12 models .",

    "we also assume a range of @xmath43 values .",
    "this has the following significance .",
    "as already pointed out by @xcite , the best - modeling values of @xmath43 from @xcite are not compatible with a resonant location of saturn s spin axis .",
    "this is because the cassini state c@xmath42 would be moved to a significantly larger obliquity value ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "so these values of @xmath43 would imply that saturn s spin circulates about the cassini state c@xmath107 .",
    "on the other hand , the significant obliquity of saturn requires an increase when the @xmath1 value was crossing @xmath43 value , as schematically shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for jupiter s obliquity during the phase  1 .",
    "@xcite tested this scenario using numerical simulations and found it extremely unlikely : initial data of an insignificant measure have led this way to the current spin state of saturn .",
    "indeed , here we recover the same result with a less extensive set of numerical simulations .    given the arguments discussed above we therefore tend to believe that the precession constant of saturn may be somewhat smaller than the one determined by @xcite .",
    "for instance , r.  a. jacobson ( personal communication ) determined the saturn precession from the saturn s ring observations .",
    "the mean precession rate obtained by him is @xmath185 arcsec  yr@xmath7 ( formal uncertainty of about 6% ) .",
    "this value would indicate @xmath43 in the range between @xmath186 arcsec  yr@xmath7 and @xmath187 arcsec  yr@xmath7 .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite report other observational constraints of saturn s pole precession that have comparably large uncertainty .",
    "we therefore sampled a larger interval of the @xmath43 values to make sure that all interesting possibilities are accounted for .",
    "our numerical simulations thus spanned a grid of two parameters : ( i ) @xmath43 discussed above , and ( ii ) @xmath126 , the e - folding timescale of the @xmath1 frequency that slowly changes due to residual migration of neptune and depletion of the outer disk .",
    "the amplitude related to the @xmath1 term in the inclination vector @xmath57 of saturn is kept constant , namely @xmath188 . to keep number of tested free parameters low , we assumed initial orientation of saturn s spin axis @xmath12 to be near the pole of the invariable plane .",
    "specifically , we set its obliquity to @xmath189 in the reference frame of the @xmath1-frequency fourier term in @xmath57 . to prevent fluke results , we sampled 36 values of longitude @xmath85 of the saturn s pole in the same reference frame , incrementing it from @xmath190 by @xmath191 .",
    "each of the simulations covered a @xmath192  gyr timespan .",
    "we recorded saturn s pole orientation during the last @xmath193  myr time interval .",
    "we specifically analysed if it passes close to the current location of saturn s pole , namely @xmath194 and @xmath195 in the @xmath1-frequency reference frame ( see table  2 in ward & hamilton 2004 ) .",
    "a numerical run was considered successful , if the simulated saturn s pole passed through a box of @xmath196 in obliquity @xmath2 and @xmath197 in longitude @xmath85 around the planet s values @xmath198 during the recorded @xmath193  myr time interval .",
    "note that the libration period of saturn s pole around cassini state c@xmath42 , if captured in the spin - orbit resonance , is @xmath199  myr , depending on the libration amplitude .",
    "this set our requirement for the timespan over which we monitored saturn s pole position .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows the results from this suite of runs .",

    "we note that no successful solutions were obtained for @xmath200 arcsec  yr@xmath7 and all successful solutions correspond to the capture in the resonance zone around the cassini state c@xmath42 .",
    "the absence of low - probability solutions in which saturn s pole would circulate about the cassini state c@xmath107 for larger @xmath43 may be related to the limited number of simulations performed .",
    "no solutions were also obtained for @xmath201  myr .",
    "this is because for such long e - folding timescales the resonant capture process would be strictly adiabatic and the simulated spin would not meet the condition of at least @xmath202 libration amplitude ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the area occupied by successful solutions splits into two branches for @xmath203 arcsec  yr@xmath7 .",
    "this is because the obliquity of the cassini state c@xmath42 is @xmath204 for the critical value of @xmath43 , and the solutions have the minimum libration amplitude of @xmath205 .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows two evolution paths of saturn s spin vector obtained in two different simulations .",
    "as mentioned above , in both cases saturn s spin state was captured into the spin - orbit resonance @xmath1 , and remained in the resonance for the full length of the simulation .",
    "the final states of both simulations are a good proxy for the saturn s present spin state .",
    "these two cases differ from each other principally because the path in panel ( b ) shows librations with a larger amplitude than the path in panel ( a ) .",
    "note some of the solutions , such as ( b ) here , may attain a significant librations amplitude .",
    "this is because with the corresponding values of @xmath206  myr the evolution is not adiabatic and the librations amplitude is excited immediately after capture .",
    "therefore , the complicated evolution histories proposed in @xcite may not be needed .",
    "we studied the behavior of jupiter s and saturn s obliquities in models of planetary instability and migration that were informed from nm12 .",
    "rather then investigating a few specific cases directly from nm12 , we considered the general concept of a two - stage migration from nm12 , and studied a broad range of relevant parameter values .",
    "we found that , in general , the two stage migration provides the right framework for an adequate excitation of jupiter s and saturn s obliquities .",
    "moreover , we found that certain conditions must be satisfied during the first and second stages of migration , if the final obliquity values are to match the present obliquities of these planets .",
    "our results indicate that jupiter spin axis could have been tilted either when ( i ) the @xmath1 frequency swept over @xmath39 during the first migration stage ( that is before the instability happened ) , or when ( ii ) the @xmath0 frequency approached @xmath39 at the end of planetary migration . for ( i ) to work",
    ", the crossing of @xmath1 must be fast , such that the capture into the resonance does not happen , but not too fast , such that some excitation is generated by the resonance crossing . to obtain full @xmath207 during this stage",
    ", the rate of change of @xmath1 during crossing , @xmath137 , must be smaller than @xmath208 arcsec yr@xmath7  myr@xmath7 ( assuming that @xmath209 ) .",
    "since the evolution of @xmath1 mainly relates to the radial migration of neptune and dispersal of the outer disk of planetesimals , this result implies that both these processes would need to occur relatively slowly .",
    "more specifically , parameters @xmath210 and @xmath132 would have to have values along a diagonal line in the ( @xmath137 , @xmath132 ) plane with larger values of @xmath132 requiring larger values of @xmath137 ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "any model of planetary instability / migration can be tested against this constraint .",
    "the models where @xmath137 is too slow and/or @xmath132 is too large , as specified in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , can be ruled out , because jupiter s obliquity would be excited too much by the @xmath1 crossing .",
    "not much excitation of @xmath174 is expected during the @xmath1 crossing if @xmath137 was relatively fast and/or if @xmath132 was only a very small fraction of its current value .",
    "if that is the case , jupiter s obliquity would probably need to be excited during the very last stages of migration by ( ii ) . for that to work",
    ", jupiter s precession constant @xmath39 would need to be @xmath211  arcsec yr@xmath7 ( assuming @xmath212 initially ) , which is a value that is significantly larger than the one estimated by @xcite .",
    "this means that helled s model would need to be adjusted to fit within this picture .",
    "it is also possible , however , that jupiter s present obliquity was contributed partly by ( i ) and partly by ( ii ) .",
    "if so , figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig5 ] express the joint constraint on @xmath210 and @xmath132 during the first stage , and @xmath39 .",
    "as for saturn , our results indicate that the capture into the spin - orbit resonance with @xmath1 @xcite is indeed possible during the late stages of planetary migration , assuming that the migration rate was slow enough .",
    "the exact constraint on the slowness of migration depends on @xmath141 , which in turn depends how much neptune s inclination was excited by the instability and how long it remained elevated @xcite . since in the nm12 models , neptune s orbital inclination is never large , we have good reasons to believe that @xmath141 was comparable to its current value when the crossing of @xmath1 occurred .",
    "thus , using @xmath213 , we find that the e - folding migration timescale @xmath126 would need to be @xmath214  myr .",
    "if @xmath215  myr , however , the capture in the @xmath1 resonance would be strictly adiabatic .",
    "this would imply , if @xmath216 was negligible before capture , that the resonant state should have a very small libration amplitude ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". it would then be difficult to explain the current orientation of saturn s spin axis , which indicates that the libration amplitude should be at least @xmath202 .",
    "a more satisfactory solution , however , can be obtained for @xmath217  myr , in which case the capture into the resonance was not strictly adiabatic . in this case the @xmath218 libration amplitude is obtained during capture .",
    "while the capture conditions pose a strong constraint on the timescale of neptune s radial migration , as discussed above , and additional constraint on saturn s precession constant @xmath43 derives from the present obliquity of saturn .",
    "this is because , again assuming that saturn spin vector is in the resonance with @xmath1 today , the present obliquity of saturn implies that the cassini state c@xmath42 of this resonance would have to be located at @xmath219 .",
    "this would require that @xmath220 arcsec  yr@xmath7 .",
    "the value derived by @xcite is larger , @xmath221 arcsec  yr@xmath7 , and clearly incompatible with this assumption .",
    "direct measurements of the mean precession rate of saturn s spin axis suggest that @xmath222 arcsec  yr@xmath7 , which is still slightly larger than the range given above , but the uncertainty interval of this estimate includes values below @xmath223 arcsec  yr@xmath7 ( r.  a. jacobson , personal communication ) .",
    "figuring out the exact value of saturn s precession constant will therefore be important .",
    "once @xmath43 is known , fig .",
