    "the number of known extrasolar giant planets is now over 100 @xcite , almost all of which have been detected indirectly , using the radial velocity method .",
    "direct detections of extrasolar giant planets are now becoming possible .",
    "for example , @xcite detected the atmosphere of the ` transiting planet ' hd209458b using transit spectroscopy @xcite . in the case of planets which do not transit ,",
    "other techniques of direct detection are being developed , such as visible coronagraphic imaging @xcite , and nulling infrared ( ir ) interferometry @xcite .",
    "a conventional view is that the ` inner working angle ' ( iwa ) of a nulling interferometer is the angular distance to the first fringe maximum , i.e. @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the interferometer baseline and @xmath8 is wavelength . in this _ letter _ , we show that , when the likely ir intensities of the extrasolar planets are factored in , nulling ir interferometers having @xmath9 m , are most sensitive to extrasolar giant planets ( egps ) well inside the conventional iwa , i.e. ` inside the null ' .",
    "a substantial number of the known extrasolar planets are directly detectable using interferometry with modest baselines , e.g. , the @xmath10 m baseline of the minimum configuration of _ fksi _ @xcite .",
    "simple arguments suggest that interferometric detection can occur for close - in extrasolar giant planets ( cegps ) not fully resolved spatially by the interferometer .",
    "first , it is well known that a significant source of noise for a spaceborne nulling interferometer will be photon noise from the leakage of stellar radiation around the ` edges ' of the null fringe , due to the finite angular radius of the star .",
    "if leakage from one stellar radius is a significant noise source , the ir signal from the closest cegps , at tens of stellar radii , will also leak through the null fringe .",
    "second , we note that ground - based studies of the cegps @xcite are beginning to achieve the sensitivity needed to detect the planets in combined light , with no spatial resolution whatsoever . for a given interferometer baseline , at what angular separation does the transmitted ir signal from an extrasolar planet peak ? for decreasing angular separation from the star , the fringe transmission decreases , but the planet s thermal equilibrium temperature in the stellar radiation field increases , so the signal transmitted through the null fringe can remain significant .",
    "distant planets will be observed with fringe transmission of unity , but they will be colder .",
    "figure 1 shows the product of the planck function at a wavelength of @xmath11 m , times the fringe transmission ( @xmath12 ) for baselines of 8 , 12 , 20 and 40 m. the extrasolar system was assumed to be at 10 pc distance , and the planet was assumed to emit as a blackbody in thermal equilibrium with a bond albedo of 0.4 .",
    "these ` interferometer contribution functions ' were normalized to unity for the peak signal at the 40-m baseline .",
    "the asterisks on each curve mark the nominal iwa at @xmath13 .",
    "figure 1 shows that , even for the longest ( 40-m ) baseline , the peak signal occurs inside the nominal iwa at @xmath13 . for the shorter baselines the peak occurs quite far inside the iwa .",
    "for example , the 12-m peak signal occurs for planets near 0.1 au , a factor of 4 below @xmath13 . for all baselines ,",
    "the decrease in signal at the greatest distances occurs because of the lower planetary temperatures .",
    "although the peak signal for the 12-m baseline occurs near 0.1 au , this signal is reduced by about an order of magnitude from the 40-m case .",
    "figure 1 suggests that the sensitivity of a 12-m interferometer working ` inside the null ' may be sufficient to allow detection and characterization of some of the known extrasolar giant planets .",
    "using a simple analytical model of the nulling interferometer we demonstrate that the ratio of the intensity at the output of the nuller at two wavelengths is insensitive to the residual pathlength fluctuations , provided they are small compared to the wavelength .",
    "a nulling interferometer operates like a conventional stellar interferometer except that an achromatic @xmath14 phase shift is applied to the beam coming from one element of the interferometer and that the beams are symmetrically and achromatically combined .",
    "the equation for the normalized intensity , @xmath15 , is :    @xmath16\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 is the first wavelength , @xmath18 is the modulus of the visibility of the source , and @xmath19 is the rms phase error caused by residual pathlength fluctuations , @xmath20 in the system . for a point source and no pathlength fluctuations , eq .",
    "1 reduces to the usual @xmath21 null of the classical bracewell interferometer .",
    "a similar equation holds for the output of the same nuller at a second wavelength , @xmath22 . using these assumptions ,    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the angular diameter of the star and b is the baseline length , and similarly expanding the term for the phase fluctuations : @xmath25    substituting these equations into ( 1 ) and using similar equations for the second wavelength , @xmath22 ,",
    "it is easy to show that :    @xmath26    hence the stellar leakage and pathlength fluctuations cancel out .",
    "this result is valid for the case when the interferometer is not rotating about the line of sight or when the residual pathlength fluctuations occur at much higher frequencies than the rotation frequency about the line of sight .",
    "the cancellation occurs in the leakage signal variations which accompany instability in the null fringe ( not in the photon noise ) , and which would otherwise overwhelm the planetary signal .",
    "this technique is expected to work best when the two wavelengths @xmath27 and @xmath28 are reasonably close together , avoiding higher order effects .",
    "we have written a simulation code to compute the signal from the known extrasolar giant planets , as observed by a rotating 2-aperture nulling interferometer , following the principle of @xcite , and treating the output signal as a ratio , exploiting the rationale given above .",
    "the code uses the interferometer parameters for _ fksi _ as listed in table 1 .",
    "the modeled fringe pattern of the interferometer includes path difference errors , based on the current _ fksi _ error budget .",
    "shot - noise is computed from the total signal , including the stellar leakage , the extrasolar zodiacal background , and the instrument thermal background .",
    "dark current and read noise from the detection system are also included .",
    "the stellar spectrum is assumed to be a blackbody , but wavelength - dependent limb darkening is imposed on the disk , based on the solar observations of @xcite .",
    "the stellar temperature and radius are estimated from the spectral type .",
    "the planet is modeled as a blackbody spectrum with superposed molecular band spectral structure .",
    "the planet s blackbody equilibrium temperature is computed assuming a bond albedo of 0.4 ; the planetary radius is taken to be 35% greater than jupiter , based on hd209458b @xcite .",
    "the planetary spectral structure was included by interpolating in the ` cloudless ' sequence computed by @xcite .",
    "the planetary spectrum is currently assumed to be independent of orbital phase and inclination to the line of sight .",
    "orbital motion of the planet is included , using orbital elements from the doppler observations , and a nominal inclination of @xmath29 .",
    "the zodiacal background is calculated including contributions from both scattered light and thermal radiation @xcite . since younger stars will have more massive zodiacal disks , we scaled the mass of the disk as the -1.76 power of the stellar age @xcite .",
    "ages for stars hosting extrasolar planets were taken from @xcite . the inclination of the zodiacal disk is also included ( nominally @xmath29 to the plane of the sky ) , since the asymmetry from the inclined disk produces a significant signal as the interferometer rotates .",
    "we have simulated observations by _ fksi _ of all known extrasolar planetary systems using the code .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "2 , which illustrates the detection of 55 cancri b. figure 2a shows the number of photons detected versus wavelength , at the _ fksi _ spectral resolving power ( @xmath30 ) , in one 300-s integration . the calculated wavelength range in fig . 2 extends longward of the nominal wavelength limits of _",
    "the dominant source of photons is stellar leakage , with planetary radiation second .",
    "the zodiacal radiation falls below the planetary intensity for this old , and dust - poor system @xcite .",
    "the dominant source of noise depends on wavelength , but is due to stellar leakage shot noise at the shortest wavelengths , thermal background radiation noise at the longest wavelength ( @xmath31 m ) , and dark current and read noise at intermediate wavelengths .",
    "since the anticipated total integration time during an observational ` campaign ' for a given planetary system can be many days , planets whose photon counts fall well below the noise level in a single 300-s integration will nevertheless be detectable .",
    "but for 55 cancri b , the planetary signal photon counts are comparable to the noise photons in a single 300-s integration , for wavelengths @xmath32 m .",
    "this planet is strongly detectable , and more extensive spectral information could also be extracted .    in the original bracewell concept ,",
    "the rotation of the interferometer modulates the planetary signal , and we have included this process in the simulation code .",
    "figure 2b ( lower panel ) shows a power spectrum from a signal time series of 55 cancri b. as per our two - color method , the fourier - transformed signal in this case was the intensity integrated over wavelengths @xmath33 m , ratioed to the intensity integrated over @xmath34 m .",
    "the denominator in this ratio is dominated by the stellar leakage at the shortest wavelengths , and contains minimal planetary signal .",
    "the planet peaks at the longer wavelengths in the numerator .",
    "the greater null depth at long wavelengths enhances this separation of planet and stellar signals .",
    "the interferometer was rotated slowly , about 15 hours per rotation , and the simulated campaign lasted about 35 days ( 50 rotations ) .",
    "the zodiacal signal appears in the fig .",
    "2b power spectrum at twice the interferometer rotation frequency , i.e. at 37 microhz ( @xmath35hz ) , and the planetary signal also contributes at this frequency . because of the planet s orbital motion",
    ", the planetary signal appears primarily at a different frequency ( see caption ) , slightly displaced , and _ resolved _ from the zodiacal signal . moreover , because the planet is inside the null , no overtones are caused by transmission through higher - order fringes .",
    "note also that , as the signal from the planet goes in- and out - of - phase with the zodiacal signal , the envelope of this modulation is seen in the low - frequency region of the power spectrum as a peak at 1.6 @xmath35hz , twice the orbital frequency of the planet .",
    "our simulations show that a significant number of known extrasolar planets will be detectable using _ fksi _ , and that spectral information can be derived in several of the most favorable cases .",
    "these simulated detections are robust in the sense that the few most favorable planetary systems are detectable with almost any reasonable instrumental configuration ( baseline , aperture size , etc . ) or choice of long - wavelength cutoff .",
    "however , detections for the fainter systems depend significantly on the instrumental parameters and wavelength range , as well as on the properties of the detectors ( dark current , read noise ) .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the distances and orbital semi - major axes for many of the known planetary systems , with those systems detectable by _ fksi _ ( using table 1 parameters ) plotted as filled symbols .",
    "the @xmath2 field - of - regard ( _ for _ ) holds seven detectable planets , and an additional six planets are within a @xmath36 _ for_. the conventional iwa resolutions for baselines of 40 , 20 , 12 , and 8 m are overplotted .",
    "it can be seen that the detectable planets are essentially the cegp systems closest to earth , with essentially no dependence on the angular resolution limits ( iwa lines ) .",
    "our results show that planets can be detected much closer to stars than expected based on the concept of the inner working angle , computed from the nominal resolution of the interferometer , i.e. , @xmath37 .",
    "this resolution estimate is essentially the same as the rayleigh criterion for conventional telescopes , which is the angular separation of two stars of equal intensity in which one star is placed at the first zero of the airy pattern of the second star .",
    "the rayleigh criterion is well known to be a very conservative estimate of resolution , and sources can be resolved that are substantially closer than this , using super - resolution techniques such as the pixon method @xcite .",
    "similar considerations hold for interferometers as clean , mem , and other methods have provided images with effective angular resolutions much better than nominally expected @xcite .    for a wavelength of 5 @xmath35 m ,",
    "the resolution of the _ fksi _ is @xmath38 41 milli - arcsec ( mas ) .",
    "but our simulations demonstrate an ` effective resolution ' of approximately 1 mas .",
    "our results are consistent with the working resolution of the interferometer being determined by the ratio of the rms pathlength fluctuation to the baseline , @xmath39 , which for the parameters in this paper , is 0.2 mas .",
    "this is not as surprising as it may seem at first , since the pathlength stability requirement to achieve a @xmath40 null or better is essentially that of an interferometer with extremely high phase stability .",
    "the work presented here has important implications for the terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) mission @xcite , because angular resolution is often emphasized over sensitivity .",
    "the desire for a nulling interferometer using free flyer telescopes is based on the resolution needed to search more than 150 f , g , and k stars for earth - like planets in the habitable zone @xcite .",
    "given that the actual iwa can be significantly smaller than previously thought , means that it may be possible to achieve the basic goals of tpf with a structurally connected interferometer having a modest baseline in the range of 20 to 30 m.",
