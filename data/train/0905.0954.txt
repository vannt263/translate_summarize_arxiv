    "inflation @xcite ( for review , @xcite ) is an vacuum - dominated epoch in the early universe when the scale factor grew exponentially .",
    "this scenario is used to set the initial condition for the hot big bang model and to provide the primordial density perturbation as the seed of structure formation . in the framework of slow - roll inflation ,",
    "the slow - roll parameters are defined by @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "the spectral index can be expressed in terms of the slow - roll parameters as @xmath11 the latest wmap 5-year result prefers the spectral index around @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is given by @xmath13 with the slow - roll approximation the value of the inflaton field @xmath14 , in order to achieve @xmath15 e - folds inflation , is @xmath16 from observation @xcite @xmath17 at @xmath18 ( we call this cmb ( cosmic microwave background ) normalization ) .",
    "the scalar potential for the inflaton field @xmath14 of supernatural inflation @xcite ( during inflation ) is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the susy breaking scale with @xmath21 gev and the second term is the soft mass term with @xmath22 tev in order to address the hierarchy problem of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "supernatural inflation is very attractive but predicts the spectral index @xmath23 . in @xcite ,",
    "a model is proposed with the potential includes the a - term and non - renormalizable terms @xmath24 where @xmath25 for the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite . when @xmath26 is the gravity mediated susy breaking scale it is shown that the spectral index can naturally be @xmath12 , because the potential is naturally of a hilltop form ( so called hilltop inflation @xcite ) .",
    "the soft mass @xmath27 is related to @xmath26 via @xmath28 where @xcite @xmath29 as we can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , for gravity - mediated susy breaking , @xmath30 gev . for gauge",
    "mediated susy breaking , @xmath26 can be as low as @xmath31 tev . from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , it is clear that the original model of supernatural inflation can not work for lower @xmath26 .",
    "however , for the model eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , it certainly can .",
    "the reason is even if we have @xmath32 the potential still can accommodate for a successful inflation model if inflation occurs near a saddle point where @xmath33 , and it is called mssm inflation or a - term inflation in the literature @xcite . in this paper , we will explore the parameter space for a successful inflation model from eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) near a saddle point with a wide range of @xmath0 from @xmath34 tev to @xmath35 gev .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the calculation and result in section [ 2 ] .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section [ 3 ] .",
    "as in the case of mssm inflation , the potential ( eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) ) has a saddle point where @xmath33 if @xmath27 and @xmath36 are related via    @xmath37    the saddle point is at @xmath38 where    @xmath39    the potential at the saddle point is    @xmath40    near the saddle point , the potential can be described as @xmath41 where @xmath42 from eq .",
    "( [ efolds ] ) , the number of e - folds is @xmath43 the slow roll parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 are @xmath46 @xmath47 inflation ends when @xmath48 .",
    "the spectral index is ( for @xmath49 ) @xmath50 which is the same as a - term inflation .",
    "the spectrum is give by    @xmath51    after impose cmb normalization ( @xmath52 ) for @xmath53 tev , we obtain the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath54 .",
    "we show the result on fig .",
    "( [ result ] ) .     and @xmath54 .",
    "here we assume @xmath55 tev.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    as we can see from fig .",
    "( [ result ] ) , for @xmath56 , the predictions is just the same as mssm ( or a - term ) inflation .",
    "actually the lower bound can go down to zero , and recovers mssm ( or a - term ) inflation . for @xmath57 ,",
    "the existence of @xmath0 allows also @xmath3 and @xmath4 to fit cmb normalization with @xmath58 . for @xmath3 , from eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , we have @xmath59 , corresponds to @xmath60 .",
    "similarly , @xmath4 corresponds to @xmath61 .",
    "in this paper , we generalize the model of @xcite by considering smaller @xmath0 .",
    "our model is similar to hybrid inflation because the additional @xmath0 which eventually should gracefully exist by a waterfall field .",
    "however , it is different from the usual hybrid inflation because inflation occurs near a saddle point .",
    "the result is for @xmath62 and @xmath1 tev , the @xmath6 flat direction can works with @xmath63 .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath4 flat directions can also play the role of an inflaton field with appropriate @xmath0 .",
