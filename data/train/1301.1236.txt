    "[ fig:6](a ) , however , that the wavepacket does not follow a ld semiclassical trajectory .",

    "the five semiclassical trajectories shown in fig .",

    "one might expect that the energy band would break for this large value of @xmath29 , causing the wavepacket to no longer track the semiclassical dynamics .",
    "however , we note that the relatively long wavelength @xmath30 of the moving lattice ensures that the energy drop across a single well within the sol is @xmath185 pev = @xmath169 , which is small enough to keep the band intact . note also for high values of @xmath29 the approximation that the atom will remain in the lowest energy miniband becomes invalid , we estimate this upper limit on @xmath29 by assuming that interband tunnelling will occur when the amplitude of the moving wave is approximately equal to the energy gap between the first and second minibands .",
    "the two minibands calculated for the stationary optical lattice are @xmath186 pev apart [ see fig . [ fig:1](a ) ] .",
    "therefore we expect interband tunnelling to occur when @xmath187 pev .",
    "it appears , from our numerical simulations , that for @xmath188 pev = @xmath189 , the wavepacket dynamics start to deviate from the semiclassical paths due to band breakdown .    the sensitive dependence of the atom dynamics to the initial position , @xmath134 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , has an interesting consequence .",
    "namely , if the atom cloud is large enough , it can simultaneously span more than one dynamical regime .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig:6](d ) and supplemental information , movie 4 @xcite , we show the wavepacket evolution for @xmath181 pev = @xmath182 , with an initial atom cloud width @xmath183 and center of mass position @xmath190 .",
    "the figure shows that the atom cloud splits , with the lower part performing bloch oscillations around @xmath191 and the rest being dragged through the sol by the mol .",
    "the reason is , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , that the upper part of the initial atom cloud with @xmath192 lies in the wave dragging regime whilst the lower part with @xmath193 is in the bloch oscillation regime .",
    "our semiclassical analysis suggests that approximately half the cloud is in the wave dragging regime .",
    "this estimate agrees well with the numerical evolution of the wavefunction , which reveals that after 10 ms , the fraction of the cloud in the wave dragging regime is @xmath194 .",
    "this result suggests that information about the shape of the initial atom cloud could be obtained by measuring the number of atoms , @xmath195 , that end up in the upper ( dragged ) part of the split cloud , as a function of @xmath134 .",
    "for example , as @xmath134 increases so that more of the initial wavepacket lies within the red wd regime in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , i.e. so that the initial wavepacket is shifted across the black solid curve , more atoms will end - up in the upper part of the split cloud .",
    "more quantitatively , we expect that @xmath196 where @xmath197 satisfies @xmath198 , i.e. marks the position of the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] for given @xmath29 .",
    "we have shown that a periodic optical potential moving through a stationary optical lattice can control the atom orbits in real and momentum space , and induce transitions between three distinct dynamical regimes . in a semiclassical picture ,",
    "the atom can be confined to a small region of the stationary optical lattice dispersion curve , dragged through the stationary optical lattice by the moving wave , or perform bloch - like oscillations .",
    "the crossover between these orbital types creates a rich pattern of transport regimes , with multiple resonances that cause abrupt changes in the magnitude and sign of the atom s average velocity .",
    "these resonances occur whenever there is an abrupt change in the number of brillouin zones that the atom can access . since the form of the atom trajectories is predictable , and can be tailored by small changes in the mop parameters , the system provides a mechanism for moving atom clouds between well - defined points in stationary optical lattices .",
    "it may also provide a sensitive method to split atom clouds , with potential uses in atom interferometry and in mapping the initial atom cloud dynamically rather than via optical imaging .",
    "the dynamics described in this paper are similar to those expected for electrons in acoustically - driven superlattices @xcite .",
    "consequently , the cold - atom system that we have studied also provides a quantum simulator for acoustically - driven semiconductor devices in which the electron orbits are much harder to observe directly .",
    "in the ld regime , initially , for @xmath3 and @xmath199 , the force applied to the atom by the moving optical lattice , is maximal , which makes @xmath71 increase until @xmath200 [ lower filled circle in fig . [ fig:3](b ) ] . at this point , the atom s velocity in the _ rest frame _",
    ", @xmath201 , attains its maximum value for the specified initial condition .",
    "the potential energy @xmath202 ( to keep @xmath56 constant ) is also maximal , and so the force is zero in the moving frame .",
    "however , in the moving frame @xmath203 continues to decrease , which eventually makes the force negative ( @xmath204 ) , so accelerating the atom in the negative @xmath71 direction .    the atom continues to move in the negative @xmath71 direction until @xmath87 [ upper filled circle in fig . [ fig:3](b ) ] where the atom s velocity in the rest frame is minimal .",
    "the atom then returns to its initial condition with @xmath65 and the cycle repeats with the atom traversing successive regions where @xmath205 [ white regions in fig . [ fig:3](a ) ] and @xmath206 [ gray regions in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) ] . since the region of the dispersion curve accessed by the atom is not completely linear , the velocities at the extremities of the orbit are slightly different , causing the atom to have non - zero average velocity",
    "in the bo regime , the atom can access @xmath66 across several brillouin zones , which makes @xmath207 vary in a complex way with increasing @xmath29 . for @xmath97 pev",

    "the velocity of the atom in the moving frame , @xmath208 , is negative at the right - hand filled circle , indicating that the atom is moving in the negative @xmath203 direction .",
    "however , since @xmath209 is maximal at this point , the moving lattice exerts little force on the atom .",
    "consequently , @xmath71 decreases only slowly and , as a result , the atom also lingers in the region of @xmath66 where @xmath129 ( and thus @xmath210 ) is _ positive _ [ within the region marked by the right - hand bracket in fig . [ fig:3](f ) ] .",
    "overall , as the atom moves away from the right - hand filled circle in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](f ) , it spends more time with positive than negative velocity causing the atom to jump _ forwards _ along the @xmath211axis [ arrows labelled ` f ' in fig .",
