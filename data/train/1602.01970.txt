    "for the greater part of a century , the special brand of mathematics called game theory has been used to understand behaviour of social animals - including humans .",
    "much research today still focus on mechanisms that can push short sighted self - rewarding behaviour towards behaviours less costly to conspecifics and hence more pareto effecient for the population @xcite .",
    "while much , but far from all , cooperation and coordination among non - human species seem to coincide with kin relations @xcite , human interactions seem more culturally loaded with elements of punishment , reputation and normative behavioural protocols . by providing mathematical clarity combined with recognizable narratives , game theory has played a central role in describing the nature and emergence of cooperative behaviour @xcite within groups and populations . in the majority of these studies ,",
    "the population being studied is assumed to have no structure , meaning that all individuals may interact directly with all others , at random , and the interactions themselves are assumed to be pairwise , rather than true multi - participant dynamics .",
    "these are all useful simplifications , as already pointed out in @xcite . however , with the increase in internet - based interactions ( such as social media , self - organized collaborative communities , sharing economy etc . )",
    "graph theory seems to re - emerge under the headline of social networks , now with the additional advantage of a new empirical contribution of large amounts of data . comparing the system behaviour in the fully connected graph ( i.e. mean field model or",
    "_ panmixia _ ) with more realistic spatial interaction models , including those with population structure , can reveal the effect of the aforementioned simplifying assumptions on the level of cooperation , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study perhaps the simplest version of a true multi - player dynamic : the threshold game ( this claim is elaborated on below ) .",
    "inspired by @xcite , we focus on @xmath1-player games , in which @xmath2 out of @xmath1 participants have to decide to cooperate for anyone to receive a reward .",
    "thus , @xmath1 is the number of people interacting in a given match , and @xmath2 is the threshold , describing the minimal number of cooperators necessary for pay - off to take place .",
    "additionally , we follow @xcite by placing the population on a network , in which the @xmath1-sized groups are picked based on the connections between individuals . this is inspired by the fact that in everyday life in both animal and human systems , an individual may participate in several different groups , with either a high or low degree of overlapping members . in either case",
    ", it is quite possible that the experiences gained in one setting are applied when deciding upon a strategy in another .",
    "note that we have not implemented any kind of load - sharing , meaning that cooperation has the same cost irrespective of the number of cooperators .",
    "it is worth noting that we still recover the qualitative results shown in , e.g , @xcite , where cost sharing is included .    for those who are thus inclined",
    ", one can visualize each @xmath1-player match as a party in which a certain number of guests have to volunteer for food preparation for it to be done in time .",
    "if too few people volunteer , the food is never ready and no one gets anything , hence the threshold .",
    "if too many people volunteer , chaos ensues , reducing efficiency , hence the lack of load sharing ( i.e. the cost of cooperation does not go down with increasing cooperators ) . the precise and more rigorous description of the model is given in the next section .",
    "the game has been chosen as the simplest truly multiplayer game .",
    "the criterion for being a true multiplayer game is that it should not be possible to describe the payoff from a match as a sum of two - player interactions ; i.e. the payoff from a match should behave nonlinearly as a function of cooperators @xcite .",
    "we have chosen to focus on this property because we expect that a linear payoff - dependence in an n - player game would be equivalent to a 2-player game in which fitness was calculated as an average over all interactions .",
    "as the explicit target of this investigation is n - player dynamics , we believe nonlinearity to be crucial .",
    "possibly the simplest , interesting functional form meeting this nonlinearity requirement is a step function ( fig [ fig : nonlinearschematic ] ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to note here that @xcite has shown convincingly that all multiplayer games with payoff structures depending nonlinearly on the number of cooperators have attractors qualitatively similar to what is studied here ; i.e. the step function is a suitable starting point for a more general investigation .",
    "this also indicates that that this model has the potential to exhibit behaviour different from what has already been extensively described for pair - wise models @xcite .",
    "we think that this finding by @xcite supports our intuition regarding nonlinearity very well .",
    "thus , the game studied here is a threshold game in which payoff only takes place when the number of cooperators reaches a certain threshold , @xmath2",
    ". one could envision the dinner party described above , or group hunting carnivores where the prey is only brought down when a certain number of individuals participate , and where the cost , in the form of energy spent on running , depends on prey rather than participants . on another level",
    "one could imagine a collection of interacting cells or bacteria producing growth factors or drug resistance compounds , and only if a sufficient number of cellular units contribute would the common good be manifested @xcite .",
    "we consider a finite population of @xmath3 individuals , each with the choice of either cooperating ( c ) or defecting ( d ) .",
    "the @xmath4th individual is represented by her probability , @xmath5 , of cooperating .",
    "@xmath5 is called the `` strategy '' of the @xmath4th individual .",
    "the individuals participate in @xmath1-player games , in which each participant of a given match is rewarded @xmath6 if at least @xmath2 players cooperated , and none otherwise . in this way",
    "it is a simplification of the game described in @xcite .",
    "irrespective of the number of cooperators , the cost of cooperating for a given individual is @xmath7 .",
    "the game is a generalization of other games in which multiple players must coordinate their behaviour . for @xmath8 ,",
    "this game is reminiscent of the classic snowdrift or hawk - dove game @xcite . for @xmath9 ,",
    "it is the volunteers dilemma @xcite",
    ".     cooperators . ]",
    "the simulation proceeds in a number of rounds . at the beginning of each round , all individuals decide on playing either c or d , according to their respective strategies . during the course of a round ,",
    "@xmath10 matches are played , in each of which @xmath1 individuals are picked from the population , and their shared payoff according to the rules of the game is calculated before returning them to the pool . the manner in which the players are matched",
    "is described below . at the end of a round ,",
    "each individual calculates the average payoff per match of all c - players and all d - players that the individual has encountered during the round , @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that the player has full knowledge of the fortunes of these players , irrespective of how many of the @xmath10 matches they actually shared .",
    "the strategies of the individuals are then updated as follows :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is a discretization time step , equal to @xmath14 , while @xmath11 are generally of order 1 .",
    "the update takes place after each round of @xmath10 matches , such that these are in effect simultaneous .",
    "if a player does not meet both cooperators and defectors during a round , then @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) has the same value as in the previous round .",
    "all simulations are run for @xmath17 iterations , such that the amount of simulated time is @xmath18 . at the beginning of the simulation , the @xmath5",
    "are drawn from a uniform distribution on @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "simulations were run in matlab , and extensive summaries of the results have been made available as a mysql database on dryad .",
    "the model described thus far has been studied with a mean field approach in @xcite .",
    "there it was found that there are up to 4 solutions of @xmath20 in the mean field model : @xmath21 and the roots of    @xmath22    note that @xmath23 in this paper will refer to the population average of strategies , evaluated instantaneously",
    ". the lower root of ( [ eq : meanfield ] ) and 1 are repellers  any deviation however small will lead the system away from the solution , while 0 and the upper root are attractors , or evolutionary stable states , as they are also called .",
    "these circumstances turn out to be important to our findings , which will be discussed below .    defining the parameter @xmath24 , i.e. the ratio between cost and reward of cooperation",
    ", it was furthermore shown in @xcite that ( [ eq : meanfield ] ) only has real roots when @xmath25 because of this , we will henceforth use @xmath26 as the principal means of describing @xmath27-variation .",
    "we implement population structure by requiring that an individual is only matched with people with whom they are connected ( befriended ) . for all networks , @xmath28 , and , in",
    "all but the first network type , each group of @xmath1 is picked as the @xmath4th individual and its @xmath29 neighbours , for @xmath30 .",
    "this matching rule is similar to what was used in @xcite .",
    "we consider five different types of population structures , or networks :    fully mixed : : :    this is the standard case , in which the @xmath1 players for    each match are picked randomly from the entire population . in network    terms , we may think of this as the `` fully connected '' case . as such",
    ",    it is the only network type which diverges in its matching rule , in    that an individual will not necessarily be matched with all her    connections in a given round .",
    "the situation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : notopo ] .",
    "random , regular network : : :    in the random , regular network , the population is placed on an    undirected , regular graph , each vertex representing an individual .",
    "the    degree of each vertex is @xmath29 .",
    "an example is given in    fig .",
    "[ fig : randomgraph ] .",
    "ringlike , regular network , short range connections : : :    in this network , we imagine the individuals placed on a circle .",
    "if    @xmath29 is even , each individual is connected to the    @xmath29 individuals closest on the circle .",
    "if    @xmath29 is odd , the individual is connected to the    @xmath31 closest neighbours , and the last connection is made    to the first non - connected individual in either clock- or counter    clockwise direction .",
    "it is attempted to alternate between the two    directions .",
    "it is , unfortunately , not possible to create this network    for all combinations of @xmath1 and @xmath3 if    @xmath1 is even , which may be noticed by careful examinations    of the following figures .",
    "an example of the layout is given in fig    [ fig : nolonggraph ] .",
    "ringlike , regular , added long range connections : : :    very similar to the previous type , but with added connections to the    opposite side of the ring .",
    "if n is even , one long - range connection is    made , if odd , two are , to avoid the above - mentioned problems    concerning even @xmath1 .",
    "it is worth noting that these    networks are closely related to the small - world networks studied in    @xcite .",
    "an example is seen in fig [ fig:1long ] .",
    "social network : : :    as an attempt at a realistic case , we follow the algorithm of @xcite    to synthesize networks with high clustering and varying degree . as",
    "described in the appendix , the two attachment probabilities can be    adjusted to obtain networks with a wide range of structures . an    example plot is shown in fig [ fig : socialnet ] .    .",

    "unless otherwise stated , the size of the populations are @xmath33 .",
    "we have made this choice after verifying that @xmath23as a function of @xmath26 for @xmath34 is indistinguishable from the case @xmath35 , meaning that any @xmath3 above 200 is most likely sufficient for the ranges of @xmath36 studied here .",
    "all reported values of @xmath23are the result of averaging over at least 5 different initial conditions .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , we find that population behaviour does not become representative of general multiplayer games until @xmath1 is at least 4 , and not 3 as would have been naively expected .",
    "an example of this behaviour is given as part of the discussion of @xmath23vs @xmath26 , and is , we suspect , due to the fact that for @xmath37 the only permitted network structure is a collection of rings , which are very different from all other networks here studied . because of this , we have decided to focus on @xmath38 in the remainder of the paper .      as was shown in @xcite , in the mean field model , there is an abrupt transition between a cooperative regime in which two collective states are possible , a mixed and a fully defecting , and a regime in which only the fully defecting state is possible .",
    "this transition takes place as the cost - to - reward fraction , @xmath26 , changes .",
    "as will be detailed below , we reproduce this qualitative behaviour for regular networks , with some adjustments depending on the details of the network . to simplify things , we will often focus exclusively on the critical @xmath26 value , @xmath39 , at which the transition takes place . to keep things simple ,",
    "we define @xmath39 in a numerical model as the @xmath26-value for which @xmath40 crosses 0.1 , and in the mean field model as the point where the mixed state disappears ( i.e. where the discriminant of ( [ eq : meanfield ] ) becomes negative ) .",
    "the choice of @xmath41 as the point of transition stems from the observed shapes of @xmath23vs .",
    "@xmath26 , see later figures for examples .",
    "we have studied @xmath1-dependence in two cases ; @xmath2 static , and @xmath42 constant . in the static case ,",
    "we focus on @xmath43 unless otherwise stated . in fig",
    "[ fig : ndepend ] is shown @xmath39 for both setups , and we see an @xmath1-dependence in both cases . in the case of the static @xmath2 ,",
    "this is somewhat surprising , since it means that even though more individuals are available to solve the same problem , the chances of a sufficient amount of cooperators decrease .",
    "we can understand this low-@xmath2 behaviour by taking into consideration that @xmath23will tend to decrease as a function of @xmath1 , as also predicted by the mean field model ( it is beneficial for the individual to do less when more people are there to share the burden ) , combined with the fact that the number of cooperators in any given match is stochastic :    let @xmath44 be the number of cooperators in a given game . for a proportion @xmath23 of c -",
    "players of the entire population , evenly distributed across the graph , the distribution of @xmath44 is given by a bernstein polynomial of degree @xmath1 :    @xmath45    we can now substitute @xmath23with the predicted value of @xmath23for the mean field model ( upper root of ( [ eq : meanfield ] ) ) . fig [ fig : mfpred ] shows the result of this , and we see that the exercise predicts the probability of @xmath46 in a given game to increase for increasing @xmath1 .",
    "taking into consideration that the lower root of ( [ eq : meanfield ] ) is repelling , and that full defection ( @xmath47 ) is a completely stable state ( there will be no fluctuations in @xmath44 ) , we find that the @xmath1-dependence seen in fig [ fig : ndepend ] can be understood as arising from the fluctuations in @xmath44 in the mixed state .",
    "this conclusion is further supported by the fact that when this fluctuation analysis is repeated for constant @xmath42 , a similar breakdown is not predicted for large @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , it is predicted that @xmath48 decreases .",
    "this matches our observations from the simulations .    , both predicted from the mean field theory as well as measured from the model implemented on regular , random networks .",
    "we see that for both static @xmath2 as well as relative , there is an @xmath1-dependence . however , in the static case , when @xmath49 the dependence is not predicted by the mean field theory . ]    , for @xmath43 , assuming that @xmath23is equal to the upper root of ( [ eq : meanfield ] ) , as predicted by the mean field theory .",
    "note that the different extents of the lines ( i.e. that @xmath50 covers a smaller part of the @xmath26-axis than @xmath37 ) stem from the limitations of the mean field model . ]",
    "this effect resembles what was reported in @xcite , in that it reports decreasing likelihood of the population as a whole to meet the threshold , for increasing @xmath1 . in more general terms",
    ", it is reminiscent of the bystander effect @xcite : the chance of the necessary number of cooperators appearing _ decreases _ for an increasing number of participants .",
    "a similar effect was reported in @xcite .      in fig",
    "[ fig : observations ] is shown the behaviour of @xmath23for different network topologies , as described in fig [ fig : cont ] .",
    "we find that while the qualitative behaviour of @xmath23is the same , the details depend on the topology of the network .",
    "we find that @xmath39 decreases when the network is wired such that the connections become as local as possible .",
    "this result is closely related to that reported by @xcite , who found that adding spatial structure to a population reduces cooperation in two - person snow drift games .",
    "however , it is worth noting that what is demonstrated here is a considerably more general result , in that we here go beyond dyadic interactions , and grid - based populations .",
    "we propose that this topology dependence comes about through the way in which each individual experiences the rest of the population - that in fact clustering leads to the individuals behaving as if the population had an effective population size is not directly relatable to the similar term in population genetics , as also pointed out in the conclusion , below .",
    "] , @xmath51 , making the topology - effect a finite - size effect induced by clustering .",
    "the first observation to make in this regard is fig .",
    "[ fig : effl_visual ] , where we see @xmath23vs .",
    "@xmath26 for both a network with only short - range connections but large @xmath3 , and a fully mixed small-@xmath3 network .",
    "we see here both that indeed small populations are prone to smaller @xmath39 , but also that for a given @xmath39 and @xmath1 , an @xmath3 can be found such that the fully mixed model matches .",
    "this matching works as our definition of @xmath52 .",
    "it is in this connection worth noticing that by defining the @xmath52 based on comparisons to networks with the same @xmath2 and @xmath1 , any variation in @xmath52 must be due to effects other than the @xmath1-dependence already discussed .",
    "considering the cause of @xmath52 , we may consider the number of individuals that a given player can meaningfully be said to interact with .",
    "we know that the individual interacts with the immediate neighbours , of which there are @xmath29 .",
    "however , due to the matching rules as laid out in the previous section , the player also interacts with each of their neighbours ( discounting herself ) , of which there are almost @xmath53 .",
    "of these , @xmath54 are duplicates , @xmath55 being the clustering coefficient of the network . in short , we may imagine the number of direct and indirect interactions of an individual to be on the form    @xmath56    where the @xmath57 are weights used to signify that the interactions with neighbour s neighbours and so on are weaker than with direct neighbours . as ( [ eq : l ] )",
    "is too complicated for a direct comparison to @xmath52 , we have instead tried to use the same basic intuition behind ( [ eq : l ] ) to propose a much simpler expression :    @xmath58    here @xmath59 is a function of both @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and the denominator is there to provide additional dependence on @xmath55 , since the effect appears to be marked . using ( [ eq : ltilde ] ) we may test our basic intuition about the system by checking the relationship between @xmath52 and @xmath62 . looking to fig .",
    "[ fig : effl_comp ] , we see that indeed , @xmath52 is well correlated with @xmath62 ( correlation coeff . : 0.7 ) . we interpret this to mean that our qualitative explanation of how topology influences cooperation is correct . as to why small @xmath3 leads to low cooperation , it seems plausible that it is related to small populations being more susceptible to fluctuations in @xmath23 , which will be much more pronounced in the mixed state than in the @xmath47 state . in other words , that the observed decrease in cooperation is driven by the differences in @xmath63-fluctuations within the two evolutionary stable states , like the case was for the above discussed @xmath1-dependence .",
    "an interesting question is to what extent the findings on regular networks generalize to the arguably more relevant case of non - regular networks , such as that depicted in fig [ fig : socialnet ] . to accommodate the spread in the number of players in a given match on such a network",
    ", we have here decided to use a relative @xmath2 , such that @xmath64 , with @xmath65 being a number between 0 and 1 .",
    "this choice was made because most choices of @xmath66 would result in many matches having @xmath67 , for networks such as the one shown in fig [ fig : socialnet ] .    in fig",
    "[ fig : socialnet_crit ] is shown @xmath39 as a function of @xmath61 and @xmath60 ( defined as average number of neighbours + 1 ) .",
    "we see that a range of @xmath39 is possible , and also that the primary cause of variation seems to be the @xmath1-dependence discussed above .",
    "note that the peculiar shape of the coloured region is due to the fact that we are unable to sample the @xmath68-space directly , but are instead exploring the @xmath69-space , for which @xmath70 maps to the depicted region . see the appendix for an explanation of @xmath32 .",
    "we see that all studied deviations from the mean field model appears to reduce cooperation , in particular @xmath39 , to some extent .",
    "this can be understood by considering the attractors in the mean field model :    as was discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : meanfield ] , the mean field model has been shown to have , for @xmath71 , two attractors and two repellers in @xmath23-space .",
    "what this means is that if the system is brought to cross the repeller dividing the two attractors ( the lower root of ( [ eq : meanfield ] ) , the dynamics of the mean field model will dictate a transition from one state to the other .",
    "what the mean field model does not include is that the actual number of cooperators in a given match is stochastic , except when @xmath23is 0 or 1 .",
    "this leads to a certain noisiness in the simulation results , or fluctuations in @xmath23as perceived by the individual , in the mixed state , but not in the @xmath47 state .",
    "hence , since all perturbations to the initial model , studied here , have had the consequence of exacerbating the effects of the fluctuations , a higher rate of transition from mixed state to fully - defective state is observed , most critically close to @xmath39 , where the downwards jump in @xmath23necessary to clear the repeller is smallest .",
    "a consequence of this mechanism is that we would expect similar dependence on both @xmath42 and clustering for any game where two attractive states had this difference in inherent fluctuations .",
    "we note that , as shown in @xcite , the existence of the mixed state requires @xmath72 for the threshold game .",
    "this requirement goes a long way to explain why the structure - related behaviour described here has not already been extensively described in the literature , which has primarily been focused on 2-player games .",
    "in this paper we study the simplest truly multiplayer game , the threshold game , in structured populations . we find that the average behaviour of the players as a function of the cost - to - reward fraction , @xmath26 , is highly dependent on the topology of the network describing the population , both in terms of number of neighbours as well as higher level effects such as clustering .",
    "we also find that structure appears to primarily decrease cooperation , by destabilizing the mixed pseudo - equilibrium in favour of the fully defecting state ; at least to the extent that the resulting system can be compared to the mean field or fully mixed models .",
    "the observation that spatial structure can inhibit the evolution of cooperation was made earlier for the more restrictive case of dyadic interactions and only for a two - dimensional grid implementation of space exclusively with nearest neighbour interactions @xcite .",
    "here we substantiate the speculation that this evolutionary behaviour is observed in a more general context , i.e. @xmath1-player scenarios and network structures representing realistic social networks .",
    "we find that , irrespective of the threshold for payoff , larger numbers of players in each match ( @xmath1 ) result in less cooperation .",
    "in particular we find that for @xmath42 very small , meaning a relatively low threshold ( @xmath2 ) , the stochastic nature of the game destabilizes cooperation further . given the good correspondence between the theoretical predictions and numerical observations in this paper , we suggest that related scenarios ( with payoff - functions that can be approximated by a step - function ) give rise to similar evolutionary dynamics .    additionally , we find that the behaviour on highly clustered networks is similar to the behaviour observed in very small , fully mixed , populations , leading us to suggest a working notion of an effective population size , @xmath52 , to describe the behaviour for a given population structure with respect to the transition .",
    "it is shown in fig [ fig : effl_comp ] that @xmath52 to a large extent can be predicted based solely on the degree and average clustering of each vertex in the network .",
    "it should be mentioned that this effective network population size bears little resemblance to the family of well known genetic effective population sizes @xcite , except maybe the panmixia assumption .",
    "it is interesting to note that we do not seem to echo the findings of @xcite , who , by studying pair - wise interactions on graphs , found a marked increase in cooperation for heterogeneous networks . while a direct comparison is not possible in this study ( since the rules of the game , and hence the expected results , depend on the degree of the vertex ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : socialnet_crit ] does not lead us to believe that a similar effect is at play here .",
    "presumably this , like most of our other findings , is due to the bistable nature of the threshold game .",
    "the results presented in this paper show , perhaps not surprisingly , that within multiplayer games on structured populations , there is an intricate interplay between the details of the game and the structure of the population",
    ". however , it also bears noting that much of the behaviour observed can be seen to stem from properties of the mean field model - especially regarding the relative stability of the mixed and full - defection states .",
    "it is important to point out that as was shown in @xcite and @xcite , the nonlinearity of the payoff function as well as the larger number of players ( @xmath72 ) are both necessary requirements for the existence of the mixed state . as such , models lacking these features",
    "would not be expected to have a similar dependence on population structure .    finally , it is worthwhile to remember that while the present model is surely quite simple - it has no reputation , no kin - selection , no outside forcing - all refined models taking these concepts into account , but retaining population structure and payoff non - linearity , will most likely exhibit behaviour related to , or at least moulded by , the mechanisms uncovered in this paper . as such , this simplified model is relevant for all such other more specialized takes on the subject of cooperation in structured populations , as was also argued in @xcite .",
    "an example of a slightly more advanced model is given in the appendix , where players are allowed to also make suboptimal choices in their update strategies .",
    "it is found that the general results are still valid .",
    "furthermore , it is relevant to note that @xcite uses slightly different payoff structures and update rules , but still present results showing that the cooperative ( mixed ) state becomes less stable when structure is introduced .",
    "this project has been supported by the seed funding program from the interacting minds centre , aarhus university .",
    "furthermore , the authors are grateful for valuable feedback from andreas roepstorff , chris and uta frith as well as our anonymous reviewers .",
    "when generating regular networks , we have chosen the quite straightforward algorithm of always starting with a ring - like network with an even number of close connections .",
    "the connection matrix for this case is trivial to create , based on the diagram in fig [ fig : nolonggraph ] .",
    "if an additional short - range connection had to be added to this , we would go about it in the following systematic manner :    1 .",
    "pick 1 vertex on the circle 2 .   if it is not of sufficient degree , connect it to the first non - neighbour in clockwise / counter clockwise direction .",
    "3 .   proceed to the next vertex in the clockwise direction .",
    "we would then repeat steps 2 @xmath73 3 alternating the clockwise / counter clockwise decision in step 2 . as has already been mentioned",
    ", this procedure is not guaranteed to work for all @xmath1 , even if @xmath3 is required to be even .",
    "we have chosen not to study those sets of @xmath74 where the above method did not succeed .",
    "when a random , regular network was needed , we have created a ring - like network , if needed with a single long - range connection , depending on the desired degree . to then obtain a random network , it is sufficient to repeatedly pick 2 edges at random : a ",
    "b @xmath73 c  d , and if the two pairs of vertexes happen to be unconnected , to mix the pairs such that the they become connected as a ",
    "c @xmath73 b  d .",
