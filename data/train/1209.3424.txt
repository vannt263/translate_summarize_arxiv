    "the recent proof of the 4d @xmath0-theorem by komargodski and schwimmer ( ks ) @xcite makes exquisite use of the low - energy effective interactions of the dilaton , a field that can be thought of as the goldstone mode of spontaneously broken conformal symmetry or as a compensator background field .",
    "ks showed , following earlier work @xcite , that the form of the dilaton effective action is dictated by its weyl - transformation properties and that the low - energy behavior of the 4-point dilaton scattering amplitude _ 4(s , t ) = ( s^2 + t^2 + u^2 ) [ zohar4pt ] encodes the flow of the @xmath0-anomaly @xmath5 . in the forward limit @xmath6",

    "the convergence of the dispersion integral has been clarified in @xcite .",

    "holographic arguments indicate that it does generalize , and they provide an interesting connection to entanglement entropy @xcite . in even dimensions ,",
    "the irreversibility of the flow can be encoded in an @xmath0-theorem for the ` type a ' anomaly @xmath0 associated with the euler density term in the trace anomaly polynomial @xcite - dimensional euler density as [ eulerdens ] e_2k(g _ ) & = & r__1_1^_1_1 ",

    "the dilaton can be introduced in even as well as in odd dimensions , and one may ask what information can be extracted from its low - energy effective action : in particular if it can be used to prove a higher-@xmath1 @xmath0-theorem and whether it plays a role for odd-@xmath1 rg flows . the focus of this paper is to study the structure of the dilaton effective action in general @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "the dilaton - based approach @xcite to the @xmath0-theorem was examined recently in @xcite for rg flows between 6-dimensional cfts .",
    "the 6d dilaton effective action was constructed up to 6-derivative order and its structure verified in explicit examples .",
    "the examples also served to clarify the distinctive roles of the dilaton in the cases of spontaneous and explicit breaking of the conformal symmetry . in the former case ,",
    "the dilaton is a dynamical field of the low - energy theory and it contributes as such to the scattering amplitudes via feynman diagrams with internal dilaton lines ; this was demonstrated explicitly with the example of the 6d ( 2,0 ) theory on the coulomb branch @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite . ) on the other hand , when the conformal symmetry is broken explicitly , the dilaton is introduced as a compensator field which can be made arbitrarily weakly coupled such that in the low - energy scattering amplitudes it may be treated as a source field .",
    "this case was illustrated in @xcite by the example of the 6d free massive scalar .",
    "the simple ks approach to proving @xmath10 in 4d does not directly carry over to 6d @xcite , and no general proof of the 6d @xmath0-`theorem ' has yet been offered .",
    "one technical difficulty with generalizing the ks dispersion relation argument is that in 6d the anomaly flow @xmath16 is associated with the 6-derivative terms in the action : the 4-dilaton amplitude is then @xmath17 , and since it vanishes in the forward limit no clean positivity statement is extracted ; for details see @xcite .",
    "it would seem easier to derive a positivity result based on a 4-point amplitude of the form @xmath18 . indeed in 8d , the @xmath0-anomaly is associated with 8-derivative terms in the action , and at order @xmath19 the 4-dilaton amplitude takes this form .",
    "however , the 8d dilaton effective action also contains an 8-derivative weyl - invariant that contributes non - trivially to the scattering amplitudes @xcite .",
    "in fact , proving positivity of the coefficient of the @xmath19-terms in the 4-dilaton amplitude amounts to proving only that the coefficient of this new weyl - invariant is positive and does not yield @xmath20 .",
    "one purpose of this paper is to clarify the structure of the terms in the dilaton effective action in 8d up to and including 8-derivative terms .",
    "we will also show that despite the pollution from the 8-derivative weyl - invariant , the flow @xmath16 can be extracted systematically .",
    "we demonstrate this explicitly for the example of the 8d free massive scalar .",
    "the result for @xmath21 agrees with that found using zeta - function regularization of the coefficient of the log - term in the free energy .",
    "it must be noted that the study of 8d rg flows is motivated by the wish to understand the structure of the dilaton effective action and the generality of the dilaton - based approach of ks in even dimensions .",
    "we know of no examples of interacting 8-dimensional conformal theories ( and there can be no superconformal ones @xcite ) , so an 8d ( or higher-@xmath1 ) @xmath0-theorem may be of limited applicability .    the analysis in 8d is part of our more general study of the dilaton effective action in @xmath1 dimensions , with @xmath1 even or odd .",
    "the trace - anomaly exists only for even @xmath1 , and therefore it is _ a priori _ clear that for @xmath1 odd , the low - energy dilaton effective action simply consists of a derivative - expansion of weyl - invariants .- dimensions was recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "] such weyl - invariants must also be included when writing down the dilaton effective action in even @xmath1 , in addition to the wess - zumino action whose weyl - variation produces the integral of the trace anomaly polynomial ( [ tracet ] ) .",
    "despite the obvious difference between even and odd @xmath1 , we find a compact unifying form for the terms in the dilaton effective action that contribute with non - vanishing local matrix elements to the on - shell dilaton amplitudes ; these are the terms that are non - vanishing under the equations of motion . for flows induced by explicit",
    "breaking of conformal symmetry this is all that is needed .",

    "the ` covariance ' of @xmath24 under conformal transformations ( see ( [ gjmsop ] ) ) ensures that @xmath27 behaves well under weyl - transformations , @xmath28 and @xmath29 : for @xmath30 it transforms as @xmath31 so that @xmath32 is weyl - invariant .",
    "we find that up to and including 8-derivative terms , the @xmath1-dimensional action in flat space can be written s = d^dx |_g_= _ , [ sgjms - intro ] where the ellipses stand for terms that vanish on - shell .",

    "the anomaly flow as @xmath38 .",
    "we demonstrate it in this paper for @xmath39 .",
    "so in @xmath40 one simply re - interprets the coefficient of @xmath41 as @xmath42 .    the action ( [ sgjms - intro ] ) should be thought of as a generator of the dilaton amplitudes for the case of flows induced by explicit breaking of conformal symmetry .",
    "in general backgrounds , the gjms - operators @xmath24 exist for all @xmath43 for @xmath1 odd , but only for @xmath44 when @xmath1 is even @xcite ; @xmath45 is of course the order where the trace anomaly enters .",
    "however , for conformally flat backgrounds , the gjms - operators exist for all @xmath43 in both even and odd dimensions @xcite .",
    "we carry out a non - trivial test of the result for the dilaton effective action ( [ sgjms - intro ] ) using the example of the @xmath1-dimensional free massive scalar .",
    "in this example , the dilaton is introduced as a compensator to restore conformal symmetry .",
    "the massive scalar couples quadratically to the dilaton , so the @xmath46-dilaton amplitudes can be calculated as 1-loop amplitudes with the massive scalar running in the loop .",
    "the low - energy expansion of these 1-loop amplitudes can then be compared with the dilaton amplitudes produced by @xmath47 in ( [ sgjms - intro ] ) .",
    "we obtain a perfect match ; the specific coefficients @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 of the action ( [ sgjms - intro ] ) are listed in table [ table1 ] in section [ s : scalardd ] for @xmath52 .",
    "we discuss the structure of the action ( [ sgjms - intro ] ) further in sections [ s : gjms ] and [ s : higher ] ; and we show that at the order of 10- and 12-derivatives , the gjms - based building blocks @xmath27 are not sufficient and new structures are needed . perhaps this points to possible generalizations of the gjms - operators .    the paper is structured as follows . in section [",

    "we study the example of the free massive scalar in 8d and show how to systematically extract @xmath16 from the dilaton amplitudes .",
    "we review in section [ s : anomd ] how the @xmath1-dimensional anomaly can be calculated as the coefficient of the log - term in the free energy for the free massive scalar and explicitly verify a compact formula for @xmath54 by diaz @xcite for @xmath55 .",
    "in particular , the @xmath39 result matches that of our dilaton amplitude calculation in section [ s : scalar8d ] .",
    "we generalize the analysis of the free massive scalar to @xmath1-dimensions in section [ s : scalardd ] and use it to verify the general result for the dilaton effective action .",

    "_ * in this paper , we focus entirely on the scenario of explicitly broken conformal symmetry .",
    "this means that we treat the dilaton as arbitrarily weakly coupled , so that any contributions to the dilaton amplitudes from diagrams with internal dilaton lines are suppressed @xcite . as a result , the low - energy dilaton amplitudes at @xmath67 derive solely from the contact - terms with @xmath71 derivatives .",
    "the only terms in the action that contribute to the amplitudes are therefore those that do not vanish on the leading order ( i.e. 2-derivative ) dilaton equations of motion . * * _ from action to amplitudes . _ * in the dilaton effective action we find terms such as @xmath72 expanding ( [ gjms ] ) in powers of @xmath68 gives terms @xmath73 whose contributions to the @xmath46-point matrix elements are easy to compute : @xmath74 here @xmath75 and the mandelstam invariants are defined as [ sijs ] s_i_1i_2  i _ = - ( p_i_1+p_i_2+  p_i_)^2 . the simplicity of ( [ gjmspolys ] ) was exploited previously in @xcite for the calculation of the dilaton matrix elements in 4d and 6d . in this paper ,",
    "the action also contains terms such as @xmath76 which produce polynomials of the form @xmath77 .",
    "the kinetic term for the dilaton is generated by the unique 2-derivative diff@xmath56weyl invariant @xmath78 . in a flat background",
