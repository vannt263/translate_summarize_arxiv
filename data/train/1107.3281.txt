    "the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) @xmath3 where  @xmath4 and  @xmath5 , is one of the canonical nonlinear equations in physics , arising in various fields such as nonlinear optics , plasma physics , bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) , and surface waves .",
    "when  @xmath6 , the nls is called subcritical . in that case , all  @xmath7  solutions exist globally .",
    "in contrast , both the critical nls  @xmath8 and the supercritical nls  @xmath9 admit singular solutions .",
    "since physical quantities do not become singular , this implies that some of the terms that were neglected in the derivation of the nls , become important near the singularity .",
    "the continuation of nls solutions beyond the singularity has been an open question for many years . in 1992 ,",
    "merle  @xcite presented a continuation of the explicit blowup solutions  @xmath10 of the critical nls , see  ( [ eq : explicitblowupsolutionalpha ] ) , which is based on slightly reducing the power ( @xmath11 norm ) of the initial condition .",
    "this continuation has two key properties :    1 .   *",
    "property 1 * : the solution is symmetric with respect to the singularity time  @xmath12.[item : weaksolprop1 ] 2 .   * property 2 * : after the singularity , the solution can only be determined up to multiplication by a constant phase term  @xmath13.[item : weaksolprop2 ]    more recently , merle , raphael and szeftel  @xcite generalized this continuation result to bourgain - wang singular solutions  @xcite . note , however , that both the explicit solutions  @xmath10 and the bourgain - wang solutions are unstable .",
    "in  @xcite , merle presented a different continuation , which is based on the addition of nonlinear saturation .",
    "merle showed that , generically , as the nonlinear saturation coefficient goes to zero , the limiting solution beyond  @xmath12 can be decomposed into two components : a @xmath1-function singular core that extends for @xmath14 , and a regular component elsewhere .",
    "in  @xcite , tao proved the global existence and uniqueness in the semi strichartz class for solutions of the critical nls .",
    "intuitively , these solutions are formed by solving the equation in the strichartz class whenever possible , and deleting any power that escapes to spatial or frequency infinity when the solution leaves the strichartz class . these solutions , however , do not depend continuously on the initial conditions , and are thus not a well - posed class of solutions .",
    "recently , stinis  @xcite studied numerically the continuation of singular nls solutions using the t - model approach .",
    "in  @xcite we analyzed asymptotically and numerically four potential continuations of singular nls solutions :  1 )  a sub - threshold power continuation , 2 )  a shrinking - hole continuation for ring - type solutions , 3 )  a vanishing nonlinear - damping continuation , and 4 )  a complex ginzburg - landau ( cgl ) continuation .",
    "our main findings were as follows :    1 .",
    "the non - uniqueness of the phase of the singular core beyond the singularity ( property  2 ) is a universal feature of nls continuations .",
    "2 .   the symmetry with respect to the singularity time ( property  1 ) holds if the continuation model is time reversible and if it leads to a point singularity ( i.e. , if it defocuses for  @xmath15 ) . therefore , it is a non - generic feature .",
    "recently , the post - collapse loss - of - phase phenomena was demonstrated experimentally for intense laser beams propagating in water  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we further study the effect of small nonlinear - damping in the nls @xmath16 the addition of small nonlinear - damping is physical . indeed , in nonlinear optics",
    ", experiments suggest that arrest of collapse is related to plasma formation , and nonlinear damping is used as phenomenological model for multi - photon absorption by plasma . in bec",
    ", a quintic nonlinear damping term corresponds to losses from condensate due to three - body inelastic recombinations  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the nonlinear - damping term appears in the complex - ginzburg - landau ( cgl ) equation , which arises in a models of chemical turbulence , poiseuille flow , rayleigh - brnard convection , taylor - couette flow , and superconductivity ,    in  @xcite we analyzed the continuation of the critical nls with a vanishing critical nonlinear damping , i.e. , equation  ( [ eq : dampednls ] ) with  @xmath17 . since the nls  ( [ eq : dampednls ] ) is not time reversible , its solutions are asymmetric with respect to the time  @xmath18 at which the collapse is arrested . in particular , in the limit  @xmath19 , the continuation of  @xmath20 is  @xmath21 , where  @xmath22 .",
    "hence , the defocusing velocity  @xmath23 is higher then the focusing velocity  @xmath24 .",
    "when the initial condition leads to a loglog collapse in the undamped critical nls , asymptotic analysis and numerical simulations suggest that the singular core expands beyond the singularity at a velocity that goes to infinity as  @xmath25 .",
    "the question that we address in this study is whether and how the results of  @xcite for  @xmath26 will change in the following cases :    1 .   the critical nls with a supercritical damping exponent  ( i.e. , @xmath27 ) .",
    "2 .   the supercritical nls with  @xmath28 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : nls_review ] we provide a short review of nls theory . in section  [ sec : nl_dampingeffect ] we review previous rigorous , asymptotic , and numerical results on the effect of damping in the nls . in section  [ sec : criticaldampingexponent ] we show numerically that in the supercritical nls , the nonlinear damping exponent  @xmath2 has to be strictly higher than the nonlinearity exponent  @xmath29 , in order to arrest the collapse .",
    "this is different from the critical case , where collapse is arrested for  @xmath30 . in section  [ sec : supercriticalnls ]",
    "we show that solutions of the supercritical nls with a small nonlinear damping are asymmetric with respect to the arrest - of - collapse time  @xmath18 , and that the post - collapse defocusing velocity of the singular core goes to infinity as the damping coefficient  @xmath1 goes to zero . in section",
    "[ sec : criticalnls ] we obtain similar results for the critical nls with generic initial conditions that lead to a loglog collapse . in the special case of the minimal - power explicit blowup solution  @xmath20 of the critical nls , however , the continuation beyond the singularity is also defined for @xmath31 , and is given by  @xmath32 , where  @xmath33 increases monotonically with  @xmath2 .",
    "final remarks are given in section  [ sec : final ] .",
    "overall , the qualitative effect of small nonlinear damping on the collapse is the same in the critical and supercritical nls .",
    "one difference is that in the critical case collapse is arrested for  @xmath30 , whereas in the supercritical case collapse is only arrested for  @xmath34 .",
    "another difference is that the distance between the damped solution around  @xmath18 and the asymptotic profile of the undamped nls is small in the critical case , but large in the supercritical case .",
    "surprisingly , in the latter case , the profile near  @xmath18 appears to be given by a rescaled supercritical standing wave .",
    "the nls  ( [ eq : ddimensionalnls ] ) has two important conservation laws : _ power _ conservation norm the _ power _ , since in optics it corresponds to the beam s power . ]",

    "the solution with the minimal power , which we denote by  @xmath44 , is unique , and is called the ground state .      in the critical case  @xmath8 ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : ddimensionalnls ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath45 and equation  ( [ eq : ddim_r_ode ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath46    a sufficient condition for global existence in the critical nls  ( [ eq : ddim_criticalnls ] ) is  @xmath47 , where  @xmath48 , and  @xmath44 is the ground state of equation  ( [ eq : ddimcritical_r_ode ] ) .",
    "the critical nls  ( [ eq : ddim_criticalnls ] ) admits the explicit solution    [ eq : explicitblowupsolution ] @xmath49 where @xmath50    more generally , applying the dilation transformation with @xmath51 and the temporal translation @xmath52 shows that the critical nls  ( [ eq : ddim_criticalnls ] ) admits the explicit solutions    [ eq : explicitblowupsolutionalpha ] @xmath53 where @xmath54    the explicit solutions  ( [ eq : explicitblowupsolution])([eq : explicitblowupsolutionalpha ] ) become singular at  @xmath55 .",
    "these solutions are unstable , however , as the have exactly the critical power for collapse .",
    "therefore , any infinitesimal perturbation which decreases their power , will arrest the collapse .",
    "when a solution of the critical nls , whose power is slightly above  @xmath56 , undergoes a stable collapse , it splits into two components : a collapsing core that approaches the universal @xmath57  profile and blows up at the loglog law rate , and a non - collapsing tail  ( @xmath58 ) that does not participate in the collapse process :    [ thm : merle+raphael ] let @xmath59 , and let  @xmath60 be a solution of the critical nls  ( [ eq : ddim_criticalnls ] ) that becomes singular at  @xmath12 .",
    "then , there exists a universal constant  @xmath61 , which depends only on the dimension , such that for any @xmath62 such that @xmath63 the following hold :    1 .",
    "there exist parameters @xmath64 , and a function @xmath65 , such that @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath44 is the ground state of equation  ( [ eq : ddimcritical_r_ode ] ) .",

    "* chapter 7 ) and the references therein ) , and recent rigorous analysis in the slightly - supercritical regime  @xmath71  @xcite show that peak - type singular solutions of the supercritical nls  ( [ eq:1d_sc_nls ] ) collapse with a self - similar asymptotic profile  @xmath72 , where @xmath73 the blowup rate of  @xmath74 is a square root , i.e. , @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "in addition , the self - similar profile  @xmath77 is the zero - hamiltonian , monotonically - decreasing solution of @xmath78",
    "in  @xcite , fibich studied asymptotically and numerically the effect of damping on blowup in the critical nls .",
    "he showed that when the damping is linear , i.e. , @xmath79 if the initial condition  @xmath80 is such that the solution of  ( [ eq : criticallineardampedls ] ) becomes singular for  @xmath81 , then the solution of  ( [ eq : criticallineardampedls ] ) exists globally only if  @xmath1 is above a threshold value  @xmath82 ( which depends on  @xmath83 ) . therefore , _ linear damping can not play the role of `` viscosity '' in continuations of solutions of the nls_. when , however , the damping exponent is critical or supercritical , i.e. , @xmath84 or @xmath85 respectively , then regardless of how small  @xmath1 is , collapse is always arrested . therefore , fibich suggested that nonlinear damping can `` play the role of viscosity '' in defining weak nls solutions , i.e. , we can define the continuation @xmath86 where  @xmath87 is the solution of  ( [ eq : criticaldampednls ] ) or  ( [ eq : supercriticaldampednls ] ) .",

    "this rigorously shows that high - order nonlinear damping can play the role of `` viscosity '' .",

    "fibich and klein calculated explicitly the vanishing nonlinear - damping limit  ( [ eq : dampednls_continuation ] ) of the explicit solution  @xmath101 :    [ proposition : dampednlsweaksol ] let  @xmath102 be the solution of the nls  ( [ eq : criticaldampednls ] ) with the initial condition @xmath103 see  .",

    "we showed that the jump discontinuity in  @xmath193 at  @xmath12 is related to the increase of the hamiltonian as the limiting solution passes through the singularity .",
    "as  @xmath2 increases , damping affects become more pronounced , hence there is a larger increase of the hamiltonian , hence of the post - collapse slope .",
    "when @xmath194 , @xmath195 , i.e. , @xmath74  is symmetric with respect to  @xmath12 . therefore , _ the linear damping continuation of  @xmath100 is symmetric with respect to  @xmath12 , even though the problem is not time - reversible .",

    "these simulations suggest that the effect of small nonlinear damping is qualitatively the same in the critical nls with generic initial conditions that lead to a loglog collapse with the  @xmath57 profile , and in the supercritical nls with generic initial conditions that lead to a square - root collapse with the  @xmath72 profile .",
    "moreover , the qualitative effect of nonlinear damping is independent of the value of  @xmath2 , so long as  @xmath155 in the supercritical case and  @xmath197 in the critical case .",
    "thus , because nonlinear damping destroys the nls time reversibility , the nonlinearly - damped solution is highly asymmetric with respect to the arrest - of - collapse time  @xmath18 .",
    "the post - collapse defocusing velocity  @xmath198 of the singular core goes to infinity as  @xmath162 , since the focusing velocity before the singularity goes to infinity for loglog and square - root blowup rates , and since nonlinear damping increases the hamiltonian , , add the complex - conjugate equation , and integrate by parts , we get that @xmath199 where  @xmath200 stand for complex conjugate .",
