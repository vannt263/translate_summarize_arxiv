    "the pdg baryon summary table @xcite contains 123 resonances . this richness is telling us about the existence , properties and dynamics of the intrabaryon constituents . in order to extract this physical content ,",
    "the knowledge of spectral patterns is of great help .",
    "for instance the classification of the low - lying baryons according to @xmath1 multiplets in gell mann s _ eightfold way _ revealed the existence of quarks and made clear spectral regularities from which to predict new states as the @xmath2 particle .",
    "the consideration of additional spin and orbital degrees of freedom demanded the enlargement of the symmetry group .",
    "the assumption that quarks feel a rotationally invariant potential  resulted in a @xmath3 pattern .",
    "mass differences inside the @xmath4 multiplets ( @xmath5 standing for the @xmath6 multiplet ) pointed out the need to implement a symmetry breaking in the dynamics .",
    "the inclusion of a one gluon exchange chromomagnetic quark - quark interaction allowed for a correct description of the observed mass splitting @xcite .",
    "when going to higher energy states the ascription of resonances to multiplets becomes much more difficult because of the different spin - orbital structures entering as resonance components .",
    "furthermore the same validity of @xmath3 as a symmetry group may be under suspicion if relativistic effects , mixing orbital and spin degrees of freedom , becomes relevant .",
    "an unambiguous baryon quantum number assignment demands in practice two conditions to be satisfied : first the use of a complete data set and second the use of a dynamical model being able to reproduce the number and ordering of known resonances .",
    "these conditions can be rather well satisfied for the lightest - quark @xmath7-baryon spectrum to which we shall restrict hereforth .",
    "this @xmath8 spectrum , containing 45 known resonances , 25 of them well established experimentally , is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    ".positive parity @xmath5 and @xmath9 states classified in multiplets of @xmath10 ( up to @xmath11 mev mass ) .",
    "experimental data are from pdg @xcite .",
    "stars have been omitted for four - star resonances .",
    "states denoted by a question mark correspond to predicted resonances , fig . [ fig2 ] , that do not appear in the pdg . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "a dynamical model satisfying the second condition above can be built from a minimal quark potential model ( containing a linear confinement plus a hiperfine one gluon exchange interaction ) by incorporating screening as an effective mechanism to take , at least partially into account , the effect derived from the opening of decay channels .",
    "screening can be put in the form of a saturating distance beyond which the quark - quark potential becomes a constant @xcite . except for the spin - spin piece",
    "the model is approximately @xmath12 symmetric .",
    "hence we expect the baryons to be classified according to @xmath13 20plets ( since @xmath14 with defined orbital angular momentum @xmath15 and parity @xmath16 .",
    "this is confirmed by the analysis of the dominant configurations for the ground and first non - radial excited states of any @xmath17resonance up to a mass of 3 gev @xcite .",
    "the multiplet pattern appears in tables [ t1 ] and [ t2 ] .    the subindexes @xmath18 and @xmath19 indicate multiplet states that mix to give rise to experimental resonances ( nonetheless when one of the configurations ( @xmath18 or @xmath20 is clearly dominant we have assigned to it the experimental mass : @xmath21 .",
    "thus for example @xmath22 gets in our model a 62% of @xmath23 and a 34% of @xmath24 whereas @xmath25 gets 35% of @xmath26 and 64% of @xmath24 . a comparative analysis between the model masses and data",
    "might even indicate less mixing than calculated by the model , what would make the symmetry scheme more predictive .",
    "this seems to be confirmed by the spectral regularities observed for @xmath27 when one identifies multiplet states with known resonances , for instance @xmath28 , @xmath29 and so on ( one exception is @xmath30 with the same dominant configuration than @xmath22 due to the spin - spin interaction ) .",
    "these spectral regularities can be summarized as :            the extension of this pattern up to 3 gev drives to the prediction of until now undetected resonances as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , containing the @xmath39 $ ] ground and first non - radial excitations .",
    "it is worth to mention that the existence of nucleon parity doublets is a consequence of the almost exact cancellation of a bigger repulsion ( due to a bigger @xmath40 and @xmath15 ) and a bigger attraction ( due to @xmath41 ) for @xmath42 states .",
    "no parallel degeneracy for @xmath43 s is found against theoretical proposals @xcite that have been questioned recently @xcite .",
    "though new experimental data , to confirm or discard the validity of our predictions , are definitely needed we think the _ symmetry way _ can be of great interest to guide experimental searches .",
