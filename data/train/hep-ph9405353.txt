    "hadrons containing heavy quarks have attracted a lot of theoretical attention recently , since there has been an improvment in the understanding of heavy hadrons .",
    "the standard model describes the decays of the heavy quarks , but due to the confinement property of the strong interactions only the decays of heavy hadrons may be observed . in order to make contact between the quark and the hadron level , one has to deal with the qcd bound - state problem , which has not yet been solved .",
    "for this reason one has to use models to describe the weak decays of hadrons .",
    "however , it has been observed recently by various authors @xcite that the model dependence may be reduced substantially for @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks .",
    "the mass of these quarks is much larger than the energy scale determined by the light degrees of freedom , and it is convenient to switch to an effective theory description in which the dynamical degrees of freedom of the heavy quark are `` integrated out '' ; in other words , the heavy quark becomes an infinitely heavy , static source of a colour field , moving with a fixed velocity .",
    "this `` heavy quark effective theory '' ( hqet ) corresponds to a systematic expansion of the full qcd green - functions in inverse powers of the heavy - quark mass(es ) .",
    "the leading terms of this heavy mass expansion may be constructed from a renormalizable lagrangian , which may be obtained from qcd by following the usual steps to construct an effective theory @xcite .    in the heavy mass limit ,",
    "two new symmetries appear , which are not present in qcd .",
    "the first symmetry is the heavy flavour symmetry , which is due to the fact that the interaction of the quarks with the gluons is flavour blind and in the heavy mass limit all heavy quarks act as a static source of colour .",
    "formally this corresponds to an @xmath2 symmetry relating @xmath0 into @xmath1 quarks moving with the same velocity .",
    "the second symmetry is the spin symmetry of the heavy quark .",
    "the interaction of the heavy quark spin with the `` chromomagnetic '' field is inversely proportional to the heavy mass and hence vanishes in the infinite mass limit . as a consequence ,",
    "the rotations for the heavy quark spin become an @xmath2 symmetry , which holds for a fixed velocity of the heavy quark .",
    "corrections to the limit @xmath3 may be studied systematically in the framework of hqet .",
    "the corrections are given as power series expansions in two small parameters .",
    "the first small parameter is the strong coupling constant taken at the scale of the heavy quark @xmath4 .",
    "this type of correction may be calculated systematically using perturbation theory in hqet .",
    "the second type of correction is characterized by the small parameter @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a scale of the light qcd degrees of freedom , e.g. @xmath7 . in the effective theory approach this type of correction",
    "enter through operators of higher dimension , the matrix elements of which have to be parametrized in general by additional form factors .",
    "inclusive decays may be treated in the heavy mass expansion by performing an operator product expansion much as is done in deep inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "the leading term in this expansion turns out to be the decay of a free quark , and corrections may be parametrized by forward matrix elements of higher dimensional operators .    in this contribution",
    "i shall focus on semileptonic decays of heavy mesons and consider in the next section exclusive heavy - to - heavy transitions , with some emphasis on the model - independent determination of @xmath8 . in section 3",
    "we summarize the recent developments in the application of the heavy mass expansion to inclusive semileptonic rates and decay spectra .",
    "the heavy - quark spin flavour symmetry strongly reduces the number of form factors in exclusive heavy - to - heavy transitions @xcite ; in fact , for mesonic heavy - to - heavy transitions there is only one form factor , called the isgur  wise function . for a transition between heavy ground state mesons @xmath9 ( either pseudoscalar or vector ) with heavy flavour @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) moving with velocities @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) ,",
    "one obtains in the heavy - quark limit @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the field operator annihilating a heavy quark of flavour @xmath10 , moving with velocity @xmath12 ; @xmath16 is some arbitrary dirac matrix .",
    "the isgur  wise function @xmath17 contains all the non - perturbative information for the heavy - to - heavy transition , while the coefficient @xmath18 may be calculated from the symmetries .",
    "furthermore , heavy - quark symmetry fixes the value of @xmath19 at the point @xmath20 to be @xmath21 since the current @xmath22 is one of the generators of heavy - flavour symmetry .    in the following",
    "we shall treat the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 quarks as heavy .",
    "then ( [ wet ] ) implies that the decays @xmath23 and @xmath24 are described by a single form factor , the isgur  wise function . in general ,",
    "the relevant matrix elements are given in terms of six form factors @xmath25 \\\\",

    "a complete discussion of the corrections may be found in the review article by neubert @xcite , including reference to the original papers .",
    "here we only state the final result @xmath33   \\label{oneloop } \\\\ & & + \\ , \\delta_{m^2 }    \\label{msquared}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use the abbreviations @xmath34    contributions ( [ lla ] ) and ( [ oneloop ] ) originate from qcd radiative corrections .",
    "since for scales above @xmath35 and below @xmath36 the currents are conserved , logarithmic corrections from running will only be induced from scales between @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the contribution ( [ lla ] ) is the correction in leading and next - to - leading logarithmic approximation ; including the non - logarithmic one - loop contributions .",
    "corrections of order @xmath37 may only be induced by qcd radiative corrections .",
    "the first term in ( [ oneloop ] ) is obtained by keeping the contributions of order @xmath38 in the matching at the scale @xmath35 , performing the renormalization group running for these operators and matching at the scale @xmath36 . in this way a resummation of logarithmic terms of the form @xmath39 is achieved . however , since @xmath40 is not particularly small , one may as well choose to perform the matching from full qcd to the effective theory in only one step , neglecting the running between @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "in this way one may retain the full dependence on @xmath41 , at the price , however , of a scale ambiguity ( @xmath42 ) in the choice of @xmath43 . the second correction in ( [ oneloop ] )",
    "is obtained by this procedure , subtracting the linear term in @xmath41 , which is already contained in the first term .",
    "finally there are recoil corrections to the normalization of @xmath32 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the terms linear in @xmath44 and @xmath44 have to vanish due to heavy - quark symmetry .",
    "thus the first non - vanishing recoil corrections are of order @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "these contributions may only be estimated , since they need an input beyond heavy - quark effective theory .",
    "there are various estimates for these corrections , which are compatible with one another @xmath48 adding all the corrections to the normalization , one obtains for the form factor @xmath32 @xmath49 where the error quoted is due to the uncertainty of the @xmath50 corrections .",
    "this result has been used to extract @xmath8 from data . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the latest data @xcite are shown .",
    "three different forms of the isgur  wise function have been used for the extrapolation ; however , the difference between the curves is almost invisible . from this fit",
    "one obtains @xmath51 this value of @xmath31 is compatible with the value obtained in other ways , e.g. from inclusive decays @xcite .",
    "in order to obtain a @xmath52 expansion for inclusive decay rates one uses an operator product expansion @xcite as in deep inelastic scattering . starting from the effective hamiltonian @xmath53 one writes the total inclusive rate as @xmath54 ) contains a large scale , the mass of the @xmath0 quark . to make the dependence on this scale explicit",
    ", one redefines the @xmath0 quark field by removing a phase factor corresponding to an on - shell @xmath0 quark moving with the velocity of the meson @xmath55 inserting this in ( [ incsetup ] ) , @xmath56 where the tilde denotes the effective hamiltonian with @xmath0 replaced by @xmath57 . once the phase factor is extracted from the matrix element , it no longer depends on the large mass , and a short - distance expansion may be performed for the operator product appearing in the matrix element . the relevant momentum is @xmath58 and the short - distance expansion has the form @xmath59 = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty   \\left(\\frac{1}{2m_b}\\right)^n        c_{n+3 } ( \\mu ) { \\cal o}_{n+3 } ( \\mu ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath60 are operators of dimension @xmath61 , renormalized at scale @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are the corresponding wilson coefficients .",
    "the lowest - order term of the operator product expansion is the dimension - three operator @xmath64 , and its forward matrix element is normalized because of heavy - quark symmetries . evaluating this contribution yields the free - quark decay rate .",
    "all dimension - four operators are proportional to the equations of motion @xmath65 , and the first non - trivial contribution comes from dimension - five operators and are of order of @xmath66 . for mesonic decays",
    "there are two matrix elements of dimension - five operators : @xmath67 .",
    "the parameter @xmath68 is not as easily accessible , but the expectations from qcd sum rules are @xmath69  gev@xmath70 @xcite .    in terms of these two parameters",
    "the non - perturbative corrections to the inclusive decay @xmath71 is given by the expression @xmath72 ,   \\qquad         \\gamma_b = \\frac{g_f^2 m_b^5}{192\\pi^3 } |v_{ub}|^2 ; \\ ] ] a similar expression may be obtained for the rate for @xmath73 .",
    "the spectrum of the charged lepton in inclusive decays may be calculated by similar means .",
    "the rate is written as a product of the hadronic and leptonic tensor @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the phase - space differential .",
    "the operator product expansion along the lines described above is then performed for the two currents appearing in the hadronic tensor . redefining the heavy - quark fields as in ( [ preredef ] )",
    "one finds that the momentum transfer variable relevant for the short - distance expansion is @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the momentum transfer to the leptons .    again",
    "the contribution of the dimension - three operators yields the free - quark decay spectrum , and there are no contributions from dimension - four operators .",
    "the @xmath66 corrections are parametrized in terms of @xmath68 and @xmath78 and the result for the lepton spectrum in @xmath71 is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the rescaled energy of the charged lepton .    aside from regular terms",
    ", the result also exhibits @xmath81-function singularities at the endpoint , indicating that higher terms in the operator product expansion become important ; here @xmath82 becomes small .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the most singular terms of the short - distance expansion may be resummed into a structure function , analogous to a parton distribution function known from deep inelastic scattering .",
    "it is defined formally as @xmath83 using this function , the result for the spectrum becomes @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "the function @xmath10 is genuinely non - perturbative ; in order to illustrate its effect , we choose a simple one - parameter model @xmath86 and fig .  [ fig2 ] shows the resulting spectrum for @xmath87 gev .",
    "due to non - perturbative effects , the spectrum now extends beyond the parton model endpoint @xmath88 up to the `` physical '' endpoint @xmath89 .",
    "however , before these results may be confronted with data , the qcd radiative corrections need to be taken into account .",
    "first results have been published @xcite , but the issue is still in a state of flux ."
