    "in addition , the nice model assumes a 3050 m@xmath0 planetesimal disc placed beyond the initial orbit of neptune which ends between 3035 au .",
    "the planetesimal disc transfers angular momentum to the planets making them migrate  @xcite , allowing jupiter and saturn to cross their mutual 1:2 mean - motion resonance .",
    "this event increases their eccentricities and induces secular resonances on the icy giants .",
    "there is a period of crossing orbits which eventually scatters the icy giants outwards , which enter the planetesimal disc  @xcite .",
    "the icy giants eject inwards some planetesimals to jupiter and saturn , which makes them migrate even further away .",
    "the planets finish their migration once the planetesimal disc is completely depleted .",
    "the final configuration of the first nice model is close to the observed values for both the semi - major axes and the mean eccentricities of the planets  @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite extended their original results showing that encounters of saturn with an ice giant lead to the correct secular evolution for the eccentricities of jupiter and saturn , and not the passage through the 1:2 mean - motion resonance , as it was originally proposed .",
    "an important open issue in the nice model is related to explain the initial conditions assumed in the model , from earlier stages of the formation .",
    "this question has been recently investigated , assuming an earlier multi - resonant configuration for the already formed giant planets , besides pushing the planets into such configuration , by introducing additionally semi - major axis and eccentricity decay  @xcite .",
    "yet , the issue remains to explain those initial conditions .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the statistics of the final configurations of planetary systems for some models of planetary accretion and evolution , which are based on a model originally introduced by  @xcite .",
    "the final orbital parameters we obtain could be used as the initial conditions for detailed calculations on the planetary evolution , e.g. , aimed to describe the architecture of the planetary systems formed in the spirit of the nice model , or to address the dynamical stability of these systems in statistical terms .",
    "yet , it is not our purpose to obtain an accurate comparison with the initial conditions of the nice model , or with the architecture of the solar system . our aim is to understand the consequences of incorporating in a simple form some important physical effects on the accretion processes .",
    "the variations of laskar s model included account for the systematic conservation of the total angular momentum of the system , and incorporate mass- and velocity - selection mechanisms that tune the accretion probability ; note that laskar s model actually conserves the angular momentum , but not the methodological procedure used to achieve a fixed final angular momentum deficit ( amd ) .",
    "these aspects were not considered in laskar s model , though they constitute important building blocks of the current planetary formation theories  @xcite . by comparing the outcome of the mechanisms that we include , we are able to relate them , in a statistical sense , to certain effects manifested by the final configurations .",
    "this is done directly by correlating the masses and semi - major axes of the planets formed in a large number of realizations of the models .",
    "our results indicate a power - law behaviour of the mass in terms of the semi - major axis , whose exponent depends on the different models , and on the initial linear mass - density distribution assumed .",
    "in particular , we show that including both mass- and velocity - selection mechanisms leads to the systematic appearance of planets in certain specific locations .",
    "moreover , by introducing properly - scaled variables , we show that these results are universal with respect to the total angular momentum of the system , the mass of the planetesimal disc and the mass of the central star .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ laskarmodel ] we describe laskar s simplified model of planetary evolution and accretion in detail , clarify its predictions , and outline a short critique aimed to motivate the variations that we incorporate in the model .",
    "specific details of the variations we implement and the corresponding numerical results are described in section  [ variations ] . in section  [ univ ]",
    "we address how variations of the total angular momentum of the system , the mass of the planetesimal disc , and the mass of the central star affect our results .",
    "finally , in section  [ concl ] we summarise our results and conclusions .",
    "laskar s simplified model of planetary formation and evolution @xcite considers a system which consists of one large central body of mass @xmath1 and a large number of particles of small mass @xmath2 , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , that interact under their mutual gravitational attraction .",
    "the hamiltonian of this @xmath5body problem , in a heliocentric frame , can be written as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are given by@xmath9 ,   \\\\ \\label{eq : hamiltonian1 }    h_1 & = &   \\frac{1}{2 m_0 } { \\mathbf p}^2_0 - \\sum_{1\\le i < j}^{n }     \\frac{{\\cal g } m_i m_j}{r_{ij}}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath10 is the gravitational constant , @xmath11 is the mutual distance between the @xmath12-th planetesimal and the central star , @xmath13 is the distance between the @xmath12-th and @xmath14-th planetesimals , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the canonical momenta associated with the star and the planetesimals , respectively .",
    "clearly , @xmath7 corresponds to @xmath17 independent two - body kepler problems among each planetesimal and the star , and @xmath8 is the perturbing term , which includes the mutual gravitational interaction among the planetesimals and the indirect term .",
    "laskar s model is formulated for the spatial problem ; the numerical simulations are illustrated for the planar case .",
    "from now on , we focus on the latter case considering coplanar orbits",
    ".    the dynamics of @xmath7 is completely integrable : for each planetesimal the energy @xmath18 and the barycentric angular momentum @xmath19^{1/2}$ ] ( @xmath20 ) are conserved quantities .",
    "this implies the conservation ( for @xmath7 ) of the semi - major axis @xmath21 and eccentricity @xmath22 of the elliptic orbits of the planetesimals .",
    "the non - integrable character of @xmath23 is manifested in the long - term evolution and is due to the perturbing terms of @xmath8 . to model these non - integrable effects",
    ", @xcite considers the secular system , where the equations of motion are averaged over the mean longitudes .",
    "this simplification is tantamount to excluding effects related with mean - motion resonances .",
    "firstly , considering the case without collisions , the averaged system conserves the energy of each planetesimal , but exhibits a slow chaotic diffusion of the individual eccentricities @xmath22 .",
    "this chaotic diffusion is constrained by the conservation of the total angular momentum of the system@xmath24^{1/2 }    ( 1-e_i^2)^{1/2}.\\ ] ] including the conservation of the energy , this leads to the conservation of the total angular momentum deficit ( amd ) of the system .",
    "the latter is expressed as @xmath25^{1/2 }    [ 1-(1-e_i^2)^{1/2}].\\ ] ] physically , the total amd of a planetary system is a measure of the circularity of the planetary orbits , since for small eccentricities @xmath26^{1/2 } e_i^2 $ ] .",
    "conversely , large values of @xmath27 indicate the possibility of planetary collisions .",
    "pair - wise collisions in this simplified model are assumed to be totally inelastic and lead to accretion .",
    "assuming that mass and linear momentum are conserved in the collision , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the conservation of the angular momentum follows . from these conservation laws ,",
    "the orbital elements of the accreted particle @xmath30 can be calculated : first , the semi - major axis of the accreted particle is obtained from its energy , which can be expressed as @xmath31 .",
    "the change in the energy is given by @xmath32 then , using the conservation of angular momentum of the colliding particles yields the eccentricity of the accreted particle .",
    "as a crucial final element , @xcite demonstrates that under this accretion scheme , the local amd of the accreted particles satisfies @xmath33 this fact motivates the so - called amd stability criterion  @xcite : a planetary system is amd stable if its total amd is not sufficient to permit planetary collisions .",
    "this criterion suffices to ensure the long - time stability of the averaged system , since new collisions are not possible ; however , this is not necessarily true for the complete system @xmath23 , since the latter includes effects linked with short - period resonances which could still induce collisions .",
    "algorithmically , the model is implemented as follows  @xcite .",
    "initially , the semi - major axes are distributed homogeneously throughout the disc and their associated masses are fixed by the linear mass distribution @xmath34 ; likewise , the initial eccentricities are drawn from the distribution @xmath35 .",
    "the planetesimals are labelled in non - decreasing order according to their semi - major axis : @xmath36 , where @xmath17 is the initial number of planetesimals .",
    "note that no angular variables are specified so far .",
    "the iterations proceed as follows : one planetesimal @xmath12 is chosen at random from the list of planetesimals together with one of its neighbours , say @xmath37 . if the co - focal ellipses associated with their trajectories display an intersection in the purely geometrical sense , which is expressed as @xmath38 then the particles are accreted at one of the intersection points .",
    "note that the relative orientation of the orbits @xmath39 is a random variable defined in an appropriate interval , which guarantees the existence of a geometrical intersection ; the necessary condition eq .  [ eq : colision ] thus corresponds to anti - alignment @xmath40 of the ellipses .",
    "the orbital elements of the accreted particle are calculated and the list of planetesimals is updated ( as mentioned above , the amd of the accreted particle is smaller than the sum of the amds of the colliding particles ) . between collisions ,",
    "a random walk in the space of eccentricities is implemented , which models the chaotic secular evolution of the system  @xcite , restricted by the conservation of the total angular momentum .",
    "these steps are iterated until the total amd of the system is smaller than a critical value @xmath41 , thus ensuring that no planetary collisions are possible . clearly , the final planetary system formed is the result of two competing processes , a chaotic diffusion due to the secular evolution of the averaged system that promotes collisions , and the circularisation due to accretion that inhibits them .",
    "an important simplification of laskar s model relies on the introduction of independent stochastic discrete time - steps or iterations , instead of computing the detailed dynamical evolution of the many - body system , which is a complicate and time - consuming task .",
    "the consequence of this simplification is the limitation to provide any physically relevant time - scale .",
    "indeed , each iterate of the algorithm described above involves the secular chaotic diffusion in the space of angular momentum , and the computation of the resulting accreted particle from a total inelastic collision of two planetesimals .",
    "all details of the actual physical processes are abandoned by modelling them as a brownian motion in the space of eccentricities ( or equivalently in the space of angular momentum ) , and by taking a random orientation of the elliptical orbits and one of its geometrical intersections .",
    "additionally , each time - step is computed independently from the previous one , in the sense that there is no memory .",
    "each of the physical processes involved in each iteration have different time - scales associated , which depend on the semi - major axis , the local mass - density , etc .",
    "this implies that two distinct discrete time - steps may involve quite different scales of the physical time .",
    "therefore , an important limitation of laskar s simplified model which is inherited by our variations , is the impossibility to answer questions on the physically relevant time - scale based on the simulations .    despite of the lack of a characteristic time - scale , the simplicity of laskar s model is reflected in the fact that it permits certain analytical treatment that yields concrete predictions .",
    "these results follow from the minimum possible amd value of two colliding particles , that takes place with the outermost located at perihelion and the innermost at aphelion . after some algebraic manipulations  @xcite ,",
    "the minimum or critical amd @xmath41 , which allows for that collision , can be obtained . using the asymptotic properties of @xmath41 properly scaled , laskar obtains scaling laws for the spacing between adjacent planets and their masses  @xcite .",
    "we write laskar s results as@xmath42 here , @xmath43 denotes the spacing between two nearby planets ( @xmath44 ) , @xmath34 is the initial mass distribution of planetesimals , @xmath45 is the mass of the planet , and @xmath46 is a dimensionless constant which depends on the ratio of the colliding masses .",
    "equation  [ eq : spacing ] provides the spacing of the planets , while eq .",
    "[ eq : mass ] provides their masses ; both are given in terms of the initial mass distribution @xmath34 .",
    "we notice that @xmath47 in these equations is actually an unknown quantity .",
    "@xcite illustrated his findings numerically using a constant linear mass - density distribution @xmath48 for the planetesimals , a total mass of the disc @xmath49 ( in solar masses ) and for the amd the value @xmath50 as the statistically significant quantity .",
    "his numerical results , in terms of the number of the planet @xmath51 , showed good agreement with respect to the analytical predictions , given by eqs .",
    "[ eq : spacing ] and  [ eq : mass ] .",
    "laskar s model described above is elegant for its simplicity and predictions , regardless of the lack of any characteristic physical time - scale . indeed , eq .",
    "[ eq : spacing ] can be integrated explicitly in many cases @xcite .",
    "in particular , for @xmath52 , we have that for @xmath53 this yields a power - law spacing distribution @xmath54 . as an example , @xmath55 yields the square - root behaviour @xmath56 .",
    "likewise , for @xmath57 it yields @xmath58}$ ] , which is basically the usual titius  bode law  @xcite .",
    "similar expressions can also be obtained for the mass in terms of @xmath51 using eq .",
    "[ eq : mass ] .",
    "while the results are attractive , there is an important subtle point in eqs .",
    "[ eq : spacing ] and  [ eq : mass ] as they stand . as mentioned above",
    ", the total amd is constant between consecutive collisions and decreases only when they occur .",
    "then , below a critical value @xmath41 it remains constant .",
    "note that @xmath41 is not a constant of motion in the dynamical sense . for the comparison with the numerical simulations",
    ", laskar uses the statistically significant quantity @xmath59 , the final amd . while @xmath59 is not a constant of motion , because different statistical realizations of the model yield different values , the numerical results are quite satisfactory .",
    "indeed , in order to achieve the fixed value @xmath59 , as a methodological procedure @xcite excites the eccentricities of the planets at the end of the simulation , thus losing the constancy of the total angular momentum of the system ; note that it is here that laskar s implementation fails to conserve the total angular momentum of the system .",
    "this observation is important since the conservation of angular momentum is a cornerstone of the theories on planetary formation and evolution  @xcite .",
    "therefore , for the integration of eqs .  [ eq : spacing ] and  [ eq : mass ] , some previous knowledge of the distribution of the @xmath59 is required , or at least its dependence with respect to other initial parameters , e.g. , @xmath34 .",
    "note that knowledge of the distribution of @xmath60 does provide means to consistently define @xmath41 .",
    "frequency distribution of @xmath61 for @xmath62 independent realizations of laskar s model keeping fixed the total angular momentum of the system . in these calculations we fixed @xmath63 , which is roughly the angular momentum of the planets of the solar system . , width=317 ]    to illustrate this point , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot the frequency distribution of the final amd normalised to the total angular momentum of the system , @xmath61 , for a large number of realizations of laskar s simplified model , keeping the total angular momentum of the system constant .",
    "the figure clearly illustrates the lack of constancy of the final amd for different realizations .",
    "we further observe that @xmath41 can be defined as the supremum of @xmath59 ; while this is a consistent definition , the numerical calculation of such quantity may be involved due to the poor statistics at the tail of the distribution .    aside from the lack of conservation of @xmath64 , in the numerical implementation of laskar s model , all relative orientations of the elliptic trajectories of the colliding particles that intersect lead to accretion with equal probability . in contrast , in the derivation of eqs .",
    "[ eq : spacing ] and  [ eq : mass ] , laskar imposes a very specific collision among the particles . in either case",
    ", there is no physical constraint with respect to the relative velocity of the colliding particles , as stated by safronov s criterion  @xcite .",
    "the latter establishes that accretion is possible if the motion of the colliding particles satisfies @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the relative velocity of the colliding particles at the point of collision , and @xmath67 is the escape velocity of the local two - body problem .",
    "the former depends among other parameters defining the elliptic orbits on the relative orientation @xmath39 , while the latter can be written as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the hill radius defined with respect to the dominating mass .",
    "moreover , the accretion probability in laskar s original model is independent of the orbital and physical parameters of the particles , being in this sense tantamount of an orderly type of growth  @xcite .",
    "while this is certainly a good starting point , it is intuitively important to include a mass - dependence in the accretion probability , since it affects the collision cross - section .",
    "a particular case of interest is the so - called _ runaway growth _",
    "@xcite , during which the more massive bodies grow faster than the lighter ones .",
    "in this section we describe the variations and the numerical results obtained by implementing some variations to laskar s simplified planetary model .",
    "these variations impose , firstly , the conservation of the total angular momentum of the system , and secondly , address the consequences of using mass - dependent accretion processes and velocity selection mechanisms , not considered previously  @xcite , without leaving the overall simplicity in the formulation and implementation of the model .      for the numerical results presented in this section , we consider that the mass of the host star is one solar mass ( @xmath70 ) , which we shall use as the unit of mass .",
    "we shall also fix the astronomical unit ( au ) as the unit of distance and the yr as the unit of time . in these units we have @xmath71 .",
    "in addition , we shall fix the total mass of the disc to @xmath72 and the total angular momentum of the system to @xmath73 .",
    "these values are roughly the current values of mass and total angular momentum of the planets in the solar system , respectively .",
    "these parameters define the physical quantities of our simulations .    in order to define the initial conditions",
    ", we must specify the form of the initial linear mass - density distribution @xmath34 ( or equivalently the initial surface density @xmath74 ) and the initial eccentricity distribution @xmath35 .",
    "these distributions and the extension of the disc are constrained by the total mass and the total angular momentum of the system . in the continuum limit",
    ", the total angular momentum of the system is written as @xmath75 assuming that @xmath76 and @xmath77 are given quantities , eq .  [ eq : lztot ] can be used to define the maximal extension of the initial disc , @xmath78 .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "[ eq : lztot ] can be explicitly integrated for a homogeneous eccentricity density @xmath79 and a power - law linear mass - density distribution , @xmath52  @xcite .    for a fair comparison with laskar s results @xcite ,",
    "our simulations are initiated with a large number ( typically 10000 bodies ) of equal mass planetesimals , which is the most constraining case in terms of equivalence of the planetesimal location  @xcite ; similar results are obtained for a larger initial number of planetesimals .",
    "we also considered the planetesimals on coplanar orbits , defining their initial semi - major axes and eccentricities from a homogenous linear mass - density distribution @xmath48 and a homogeneous eccentricity distribution @xmath79 , respectively . using @xmath80  au and @xmath81 in eq .",
    "[ eq : lztot ] yields for the maximal extension of the disc @xmath82  au .",
    "this value of @xmath78 is smaller ( by a factor 2 ) than the @xmath83  au estimate for the outer edge of the original planetesimal disc of the solar system , proposed by @xcite .",
    "however , this value is fully consistent with the range for the initial conditions used for the giant planets in the simulations of @xcite .",
    "the contributions of the massive disc ( @xmath84  m@xmath0 ) that these authors include beyond the orbits of the planets up to @xmath83  au are excluded from the values @xmath85 and @xmath64 .",
    "notice that the outer disc has also a constant linear mass - density  @xcite . finally , we emphasize that the use of eq .",
    "[ eq : lztot ] to define the maximal extension of the initial disc , @xmath78 , is yet another difference with respect to laskar s implementation .",

    ", we accomplished this by the exchange of angular momentum between a pair of arbitrary planetesimals . denoting the initial angular momenta of the chosen planetesimals by @xmath86 and @xmath87 and the corresponding final ones as @xmath88 and @xmath89",

    "once a particle has a mass slightly larger than the rest , i.e. , from the first iteration , the probability that this particle is selected for collision in the next iteration is dramatically increased in comparison to other particles .",
    "this promotes accretion of the more massive particles , and hence mass growth in a runaway - like form .",
    "additionally , it will systematically open a gap around the location of the accreted particle , since the distance to the nearest neighbours increases .",
    "eventually , the nearest particles will be far enough to avoid collisions with this particle , i.e. , the geometric condition  [ eq : colision ] is not satisfied . in this case",

    ", we used the parameters describing the current state of the solar system , and an initial homogeneous linear mass - density distribution @xmath34 .",
    "we expect that changing the initial linear mass - density distribution influences the power - law behaviour obtained , essentially as it does in the analytical results of @xcite .",
    "comparing the masses of the planets formed in the simulations with those of the solar system , in our simulations the inner planets are more massive , and the outer planets are thus not massive enough .",
    "yet , it is interesting to remark that the occurrence of the specific locations ( semi - major axes ) where the planets form , obtained for the oligarchic growth model , are consistent with the initial conditions used for three ( out of four ) of the major planets considered in the simulations of the architecture of the solar system performed within the first nice model by  @xcite ; as mentioned , this unexpected agreement does not hold for the masses  @xcite .",
    "considering that our results are qualitative , such a partial quantitative agreement is encouraging to construct more realistic models , that fully explain the initial conditions of the nice model in a statistical robust sense .",
    "future work along these lines will be aimed to incorporate in the model effects related to mean - motion resonances  @xcite , which are known to be important in the architecture of the solar system  @xcite . furthermore , improving on the assumed form of the initial linear mass - density distribution @xmath34 may yield better comparison of the mass distributions . for the concrete case of the solar system",
    ", @xcite suggested that a better modelling may be an initial linear mass - density distribution that considers separately the inner and outer solar systems .",
    "other possibilities include the distinction of particles as gas or heavy elements , or the addition of an outer planetesimal disc , as assumed by the nice model .",
    "it is our pleasure to thank jacques laskar for providing us with a copy of his work prior to publication @xcite , for discussions and hospitality .",
    "we are also thankful to kartik kumar , hernn larralde and frderic masset for helpful discussions and suggestions .",
