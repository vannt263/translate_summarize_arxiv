    "recently there was a growing interest , in the optics community , towards those optical fields possessing unusual polarization features ; this because some phenomena have shown to be strongly dependent by vectorial properties of the field . for instance",
    ", it was experimentally demonstrated that a radially polarized field can be focused to spot size of extension much smaller than that obtainable by using a linear polarized one @xcite .",
    "also , azimuthally and radially polarized fields @xcite have found use in many sector of optics , like particle beam trapping , optical microscopy , superrisolution @xcite , specially when those polarization features are associated to a particular intensity profile ( the so - called donut beams are an example of that ) which implies the presence of a strong longitudinal component of the optical electric field ; moreover it was shown that beams possessing field lines in the shape of a spiral , namely spirally polarized beams , are suitable to describe fields with vortices in their transverse phase profile @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we wish to widen this scenario , by introducing coherent beams with a non - uniform polarization state with an elliptical symmetry . by doing so",
    ", we wish to show how some of aforesaid properties are easily extendable to other polarization s geometry and to emphasize the differences among all those polarizations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , after having recalled briefly some definitions about cylindrical coordinate system , we specialize the subject to elliptical symmetry ; in section 3 we derive some results in paraxial optics regime by applying the theory to bessel - gauss beams .",
    "let us suppose we have a free - space beam , which propagates along a mean direction , say @xmath0-axis , on starting from a source - plane on which we know the field distribution of amplitude and phase . in this context",
    "the term non - uniform , when addressed to the field polarization features , implicity refers to the transverse component of the field analysed through a rectangular ( cartesian ) coordinate system .",
    "so we say that a polarization is non - uniform if , on moving along a fixed direction in the @xmath1 plane , we see the vector field changing in direction when compared with the unit vector basis @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in reality , it should be still possible to find a new coordinate system respect to which the field mantains its polarization state .",
    "in other words , the field should be uniformly polarized respect to this new coordinate system . in a generical cylindrical orthogonal reference frame we can write the field , across the plane @xmath4 , as @xmath5 where @xmath6 indicates the trasverse field and @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath0 indicate the vector basis of a generical cylindrical orthogonal coordinate system , which is related to a cartesian orthogonal system by the following relationships @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are smooth functions of @xmath12 , @xmath13 variables .",
    "rectangular and circular ones are special cases of equations ( [ curv gen ] ) . in particular , speaking about circular symmetry , recently several authors have focused their attention on fields polarized in a radially or azimuthally way . in almost all these works also",
    "the field ( i.e the amplitude and phase of each scalar component of the optical field , and not only the polarization ) was choosen to be circularly simmetric .",
    "while this choice seems to be the most obvious and natural , anyhow it can be interesting to study the case in which this _ coupling in symmetry _ is removed , a case that does not have received attention at all .",
    "this fact is a little odd , specially if one thinks to the way in which a radially or azimuthally circular polarized field can be obtained in practice @xcite .",
    "for instance , one of the methods to obtain a radially polarized beam is to combine coherently an hermite - gauss beam of order @xmath14 and an analogous beam , but of order @xmath15 , both arising from a laser beam , on supposing that amplitude and phase of the two beams are the same .",
    "there exist other metods , but all of them also suppose to have a very good control of the amplitude of the two component that one adds togheter . actually this is true only approximately and in practice one can consider the effect of some difference in amplitude between the two emerging beams , a difference which gives rise just to an elliptical symmetry . in the next section",
    "we start by analysing the form of a generical field endowed with features that break both the circular than rectangular symmetry and we will discuss the relative properties .",
    "let us suppose we have a field like that in equation ( [ campo completo ] ) and @xmath16 be @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 indicate two arbitrary real constants , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are , respectively , the radial and angular coordinates of a circular - symmetric coordinate system , @xmath22 is a radial - circular function across a @xmath0 plane and @xmath23 is a constant angle . we suppose here that @xmath24 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the field in equation ( [ campo ] ) can be rewritten as follows @xmath25\\ ] ] by choosing the terms @xmath26 and @xmath27 as @xmath28 @xmath29 the first observation we do is trivial . if we fix the radial coordinate and we let to vary only @xmath21-variable , we will see the arrow describing the electric field in equation ( [ campo ] ) to describe an ellipse with semiaxis @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "more interesting is to find the shape of the field lines for the aforesaid field . to achieve this goal we prefer to refer to a circular coordinate system",
    ". to obtain the field lines one needs to solve the equation @xmath32 which becomes , in polar coodinates , @xmath33 where we have defined a new constant @xmath34 . equation ( [ field lines2 ] ) can be transformed into the following relation @xmath35 } { [ \\sin2\\theta\\cos\\alpha(1-a)/2-\\sin\\alpha(\\sin^2\\theta+a\\cos^2\\theta)]}}\\ ] ] by recalling the relationship between cartesian and circular coordinates .",
    "we note that when @xmath36 ( i.e in the circular - symmetric case ) this equation reduces to @xmath37 and the solution is a line in the shape of a logarithmic ( circular ) spiral @xcite .",
    "solving equation ( [ field lines2 ] ) is a little more difficult because the presence of the coefficient @xmath38 breaks the polar symmetry .",
    "we can start by studying two particular cases , i.e , when @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in the first case ( @xmath39 ) equation ( [ field lines2 ] )",
    "becomes @xmath41 this equation can be solved , by rewriting it in the following form @xmath42 and it gives @xmath43^{1/(a-1)}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is an integration constant .",
    "equation ( [ lines 0 ] ) describes open lines , which tend to lines through the origin when @xmath45 , and that represent the analogous of radial - circular polarization for the geometry in subject , namely a radial - elliptical polarization . in cartesian coordinates it reduces to the following relation between @xmath46 and @xmath47 coordinates @xmath48 where k is a constant value . in the other case ( @xmath40 )",
    "equation ( [ field lines3 ] ) becomes @xmath49 and it gives @xmath50 this is the polar form of ellipses , with ( on considering @xmath51 ) the major axis parallel to y - axis and it represents the azimuthal polarization for elliptical geometry namely an azimuthal - elliptical polarization .",
    "when @xmath36 the ellipses become circles ( described by @xmath52 relation ) , i.e. we find again the circularly - symmetric case .",
    "for the intermediate case , that is for @xmath53 , the integration of the respective differential equation is less easy . in figure  ( [ spiral ] ) we report the solution after having choosen @xmath54 and the quotient @xmath55 .",
    "the field line that arises is a logarithmical ( but elliptical ) spiral .",
    "spirally beams were introduced by gori @xcite for circular - symmetric case and here we found a natural extension to elliptically - symmetric case . in the following we analyse some properties of this kind of beam .",
    "we have already seen which is the role of @xmath23 angle : when it tends to zero the polarization tends to become radial - elliptical , the field being tangent to curves like in equation ( [ lines 0cartesian ] ) whereas when it tends to @xmath56 the polarization tends to be azimuthal - elliptical , the field being tangent to ellipses described by equation ( [ lines pi/2 ] ) .",
    "also we note that the beam described by equation ( [ campo ell ] ) is anisotrope , i.e its tranverse intensity pattern depends by @xmath21 angle .",
    "indeed , for the intensity of transverse component holds @xmath57\\ ] ] in which the angular dependence is evident .",
    "it is simple to see that the maximum intensity directions are @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) in which equation ( [ i ] ) becomes @xmath60 so we can find the value of angle @xmath23 and , as a consequence , also the polarization kind , by intensity measurement , contrary to the circular - symmetric case in which the intensity is dependent only from the radial coordinate @xmath20 and does not give any information about polarization . in other words , in the circular - symmetric case",
    "all transverse intensity profiles associated to a particular polarization state ( radial , azimuthal , spiral ones , etc . )",
    "are undistinguishable one to another . in the elliptical - symmetric case",
    ", one can obtain all the parameters , i.e. the ratio @xmath61 and the angle @xmath23 , simply by the intensity transverse map measured across a generical tranverse plane .",
    "indeed , with reference to equation ( [ i ] ) , by measuring the maximum intensity direction one evalues the angle @xmath23 ( equation ( [ max dir ] ) , whereas by measuring the angular - visibility ratio @xmath62 one evalues the values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( the indice @xmath20 indicates that the radial coordinate is fixed ) .",
    "also we note that the equation ( [ i ] ) never goes to zero , this because the term @xmath63 is different to zero @xmath64 ( the case @xmath65 represents linear polarization and here is not considered ) .",
    "it follows that it ever holds @xmath66 .",
    "it remains to see how one can obtain such a field .",
    "this is the purpose of the next section .",
    "it is well known that bessel - gauss beams ( @xmath67 beams for short ) are solution of scalar paraxial wave equation and were introduced for the first time from gori _ et al .",
    "in particular gori introduced the linearly polarized @xmath67 beams of zero - order , here denoted for convenience as @xmath68 .",
    "subsequently many authors have been interested both to the generalization to vectorial @xcite and higher - order @xmath67 beams , both to beam with unusual polarization features , as azimuthal and radial ones @xcite .",
    "here we recall , for reader convenience , the form of a @xmath68 @xmath69\\exp[\\frac{-r^2}{w^2 ( 1+iz / l ) } ] \\exp[\\frac{-i\\beta^2 z}{2k(1+iz / l)}]\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the zero - order bessel function of the first kind , @xmath71 is the rayleigh length , @xmath72 is the minimum spot size of the gaussian beam , and @xmath73 is the intensity of the tranverse wave vector ; to extend the vectorial treatise to encompasse also a non - uniform elliptical polarization we start from a vectorial paraxial wave equation .",
    "on starting from maxwell s equations in vacuum , in absence of sources , we arrive to the following equation for the complete vector field @xmath74 @xmath75 on introducing a `` slowly varying part '' of @xmath76 , say @xmath77 , with @xmath78 and by making use of the paraxial approximation , we obtain that @xmath77 is governed from the following equations @xcite @xmath79 @xmath80 in which we have decomposed the field @xmath77 in longitudinal and transverse component , i.e. @xmath81 .",
    "now , if we decompose also the field @xmath82 into rectangular component , i.e. we let @xmath83 we obtain two scalar paraxial wave equations , each for single component , @xmath84 @xmath85 equation ( [ parax 1])-([parax 2 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath86 and @xmath87 , after introduced a linear differential operator @xmath88 .",
    "now , as the @xmath71 operator commutes with the infinitesimal displacement operators @xcite @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , it is possible to obtain new solutions from known solutions by mean of arbitrary differentiation . this observation will be crucial to obtain elliptically symmetric polarized @xmath67 beams .",
    "indeed , the first thing to do is differentiating , respect to @xmath46 and @xmath47 variables , a @xmath68 beam ; in this way we obtain two new possible solutions for a scalar paraxial wave equation : @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "if we now linearly combine them properly we find the espb . to this purpose",
    "it is sufficient to let @xmath94\\\\ f_y = b[\\partial_y(bg_0 ) \\cos\\alpha+\\partial_x(bg_0)\\sin\\alpha]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath18 and @xmath19 are two arbitrary constant , with @xmath24 , and @xmath23 , as usual , is a constant angle .",
    "on utilizing the position in equations ( [ cambio 1])-([cambio 2 ] ) we finally obtain @xmath95 \\times \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\exp[-\\frac{i\\beta^2 z}{2k(1+iz / l)}][\\beta j_1(\\frac{\\beta r}{1+iz / l})+\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{2r}{w^2}j_0(\\frac{\\beta r}{1+iz / l})][\\sinh\\xi \\cos(\\theta+\\alpha ) \\hat x+\\cosh\\xi \\sin(\\theta+\\alpha ) \\hat y]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as the paraxial propagation has to be satisfied , from equation ( [ espb ] ) follows that the function @xmath22 on the source plane ( @xmath4 ) ca nt be choosen in a arbitrary way .",
    "in particular , by comparing equation ( [ campo ] ) and equation ( [ espb ] ) , we have @xmath96 [ \\beta j_1(\\beta r)+\\frac{2r}{w^2}j_0(\\beta r)]\\ ] ] in figures  ( [ intensita ] ) we report the intensity pattern of a esp bessel - gauss beam , evalued at different transverse planes .",
    "we see that the beam mantains , during its paraxial propagation , a zero in correspondence of @xmath0 axis ( a properties that is shared with the classical donut beams ) . in figure  ( [ pol patt ] )",
    "we report the polarization pattern , in correspondence to the @xmath4 plane , in which is shown the behaviour of tranverse field for @xmath54 , and a ratio @xmath97 . on changing the sign of the linear combination in equation ( [ combinazioni lin 1 ] ) as well as the ratio @xmath61 one can obtain other interesting polarization pattern . in figure  ( [ vari alfa ] ) we plot intensity across the tranverse plane @xmath4 , for different values of angle @xmath23 , to show the aforesaid angular dependence . before closing the present section",
    ", we wish to say something about the longitudinal component of the electric field . to do that we will refer to the generical form of epsb as that in equation ( [ campo ell ] ) and we shall use equation ( [ parax vett long ] ) to obtain the longitudinal component in paraxial regime : @xmath98 after straightforward calculations we find @xmath99\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which represents the full form of the longitutinal component in paraxial approximation .",
    "here we see that , contrary to the circular - symmetric case for which an azimuthally polarized field does not give rise to a component along the z - axis , when we have an azimuthal - elliptical polarization ( for which @xmath40 ) , @xmath100 is not null and holds @xmath101\\ ] ] and it goes to zero as @xmath102 .",
    "this is obvious if we recall that when @xmath103 the geometry polarization tends to become circular because for high value of @xmath27 , @xmath104 and the ellipses in equation ( [ lines pi/2 ] ) tend to become circles .",
    "the fact that the longitudinal component changes by changing coordinate system is well - known and it can explained by mean a geometrical point of view . indeed ,",
    "equation ( [ fz ] ) states that @xmath105 is a divergence of a vectorial field .",
    "the divergence @xmath106 counts the algebrical sum of sinks ( i.e. where a field line of @xmath107 terminates ) and sources ( i.e. where a field line of @xmath107 originates ) into a surface element , across a @xmath1 plane . since the divergence is a pseudoscalar , namely we are dealing with a _ density _ ,",
    "it is not invariant under a generical space deformation .",
    "if , for example , the space is squeezed in a way in which the areas are reduced , the density ( i.e. @xmath100 ) increases . in practice",
    ", a distortion of space can be thought as a transformation of coordinates and the fact that the divergence operation is dependent by the coordinate system in which we work means that we are dealing with metrical , and not topological , features of the field @xcite .    , @xmath54 .",

    "a beam of this kind mantains its polarization state under free - space paraxial propagation .",
    "in particular we have derived a natural extension to elliptically - symmetric case of spirally - polarized beams introduced by gori @xcite for circular symmetric case .",
    "some properties of this kind of field have been analysed . in particular ,",
    "we have pointed out that , by using an elliptically - symmetric polarization , the tranverse intensity profile gives directly information about the polarization state , the angular behaviour of the intensity depending from it .",
    "this implies that it is possible to measure the field polarization state only by an acquisition of the intensity pattern across a generical tranverse plane .",
    "this is in contrast with the analogous situation in circular - symmetric case , in which the intensity pattern is indipendent from the particular polarization state .",
    "indeed , a field polarized in a radially way produces a tranverse intensity profile identical to that produced by the azimuthally or spirally polarized ones , or any other combination of them which mantains the circular symmetry . due to",
    "its important role in optics microscopy , we have reported also the form of the longitudinal component for the electric field , in paraxial approximation .",
