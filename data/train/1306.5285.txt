    "motivated by generalizations to other areas of physics of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , i.e. , the duality between the geometry of a @xmath3-dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) space and a @xmath4-dimensional conformal field theory ( cft ) , lifshitz space - times have received considerable attention of late .",
    "they represent gravity duals of non - relativistic systems that appear in condensed matter physics @xcite with an anisotropic scaling symmetry @xmath5 , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the dynamical exponent accounting for the different scale transformation between the temporal and spatial coordinates .",
    "these space - times are described in 3 + 1 dimensions by the metrics    @xmath8    where @xmath9 represents a two - dimensional vector and the radial coordinate @xmath10 scales according to @xmath11 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for @xmath12 the above metric reduces to the usual four - dimensional ads metric .",
    "black holes with asymptotic behavior given by these anisotropic scale invariant space - times represent gravity duals of condensed matter systems at finite temperature .",
    "asymptotically lifshitz black hole solutions have been reported in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "some thermodynamic aspects of these black holes have also been studied in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on the geodesic structure of a 3 + 1 dimensional black hole presented by @xcite , the asymptotic behavior of which is given by eq.([ecuacion ] ) with dynamical exponent @xmath0 , which emerges as an exact solution of the einstein - scalar - maxwell theory @xcite , @xcite .",
    "geodesic studies of the @xmath0 topological lifshitz black hole in 3 + 1 dimensions and of the @xmath13 lifshitz black hole in 2 + 1 dimensions , which has been found to be a solution to the new massive gravity theory , have been reported recently in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . in this investigation",
    "the motion of massless and massive particles is studied in a similar black hole background using the standard lagrangian procedure @xcite .",
    "the effective potential analysis provides the means to describe the motion of particles along null and time - like geodesics .",
    "the exact solutions of the geodesic equations are presented .",
    "the analytical expressions for the radial geodesics are given as expressions of the proper and coordinate times .",
    "moreover , the equations for the angular motion of the test particle are provided through the @xmath1weierstra function .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii the geodesic equations are obtained for ( massless and massive ) particles in the space - time found in the 3 + 1 dimensional space - time found in @xcite and @xcite . then their radial and angular motions are examined .",
    "finally , in section iii the results and conclusions are discussed .",
    "let us consider the action of the einstein - scalar - maxwell theory , which is given by @xcite    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the cosmological constant , @xmath16 is a massless scalar field , and @xmath17 corresponds to the maxwell field .",

    "the event horizon is located at @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the mass of the corresponding black hole determined by the euclidean action approach , and @xmath23 is the volume of two - dimensional spatial directions . while , the scalar and maxwell fields are given by the expressions    @xmath24    @xcite determined the thermodynamical properties of this lifshitz black hole and presented a stability analysis considering the scalar field perturbation of this black hole . in particular , it was found that the temperature @xmath25 , the bekenstein  hawking entropy @xmath26 , the heat capacity @xmath27 , and the helmholtz free energy @xmath28 are given by @xmath29    the curvature scalar , the principal quadratic invariant of the ricci tensor and the kretschmann scalar of this space - time are given by the following expressions    @xmath30    these curvature invariants are regular on the event horizon , @xmath31 , and therefore this surface only expresses a singularity of the coordinates used to define the metric ( [ g2 ] ) .",
    "however , all these scalars diverge in @xmath32 , and thus this point corresponds to a curvature singularity .    in order to study the motion of test particles in the background ( [ g2 ] ) , the standard lagrangian approach is used ( @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian is    @xmath33    here , the dot refers to a derivative with respect to an affine parameter , @xmath34 , along the trajectory , and , by normalization , @xmath35 for massless ( massive ) particles .",
