    "therefore , we can determine the order of magnitude of the number of layers that is needed to reach a certain effectiveness .",
    "however , the order of magnitude of the number of layers on fig . [ heat_flux_convergence_extrapolation ] highlights the fact that achieving high effectiveness demands a high level of engineering of the homogenized concentrator .",
    "while concentric multilayers do not allow to reach perfect heat concentrators , it was shown how the homogenization of orthoradial multilayered structures allows one to achieve an ideal anisotropic heat concentrator .",
    "the complete design of such structures was given and we calculated the temperature and flux variations within the thermal device at different pulsations .",
    "furthermore , the quantitative effectiveness of the homogenized concentrators was numerically calculated versus the number of orthoradial layers and it was shown that the performances of the multi - layered concentrators are independent of the pulsation .",
    "extrapolation on the numerical results allows one to adapt the complexity of the concentrator once the required performances are chosen and fairly high numbers of layers are found .",
