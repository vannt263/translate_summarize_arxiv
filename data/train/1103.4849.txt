    "e.g. _ the realization of spin - qubits @xcite . by opening the tunneling barrier between quantum dots and the metallic electrodes used as contacts ,",
    "quite fascinating physics emerges at strong tunnel coupling . in the case of an odd number of trapped electrons in a dot with a single orbital well separated in energy from other excitations ( due to confinement and coulomb blockade ) , an artificial and tunable version of the spin @xmath1 kondo effect",
    "can be realized  @xcite .",
    "in that situation , magnetic screening of the single spin by the fermi sea occurs below the so - called kondo temperature @xmath2 , giving rise to a conductance increase up to the maximum unitary value @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the electron charge and @xmath5 planck s constant  @xcite .",
    "the first observation in semiconducting quantum dots of the kondo effect  @xcite has triggered intense experimental research to make similar observations in other physical systems such as carbon nanotubes  @xcite and molecular devices  @xcite , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review . in parallel , many theoretical works have followed , and at present reliable methods , such as the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) @xcite , have been developped .",
    "these calculations can allow quantitative comparison to experiments , especially because the spin @xmath1 kondo effect shows simple universal scaling laws , that can be checked in quantum transport measurements . at present , one important goal is to understand in similar detail the electronic transport through multi - orbital dots , a situation clearly raised both by semiconducting and molecular devices .",
    "the next step towards complexity , two - electron quantum dots , seems deceptively small , yet brings a richness that is still not fully clarified .",
    "theoretically , a multitude of new effects have been predicted over the years in the realm of kondo physics , and many have been observed thanks to the great tunability of quantum dot systems .",
    "we briefly give an overall review of this physics in the rest of this introduction , with additional details provided in section  [ instabilities ] .",
    "let us first focus on the case where the two orbitals experience strong ferromagnetic hund s rule , so that the triplet configuration constitutes the main low lying states .",
    "this can result in the spin @xmath0 underscreened kondo effect if a _",
    "screening channel is active , as initially proposed by nozires and blandin  @xcite , and only recently experimentally observed  @xcite .",
    "this rather exotic kondo effect shows a singular ( logarithmic ) approach to strong coupling , in contrast to the regular fermi liquid behavior of fully screened kondo impurities observed in odd - charge spin @xmath1 quantum dots @xcite .",
    "because hund s rule competes with the orbital level spacing , an intra - orbital singlet state is usually close ( and often lower ) in energy to the triplet states , and the competition between singlet and triplet can give rise to very rich physics .",
    "one interesting example is the so - called singlet - triplet `` transition '' , which realizes a fully screened kondo effect by bringing into degeneracy singlet and triplet magnetic levels ( it is thus rather a crossover than a real phase transition ) , for which two different scenario can be obtained .",
    "the simplest situation occurs in carbon nanotubes ( or molecular quantum dots ) , where a strong zeeman effect is used to cross the singlet state with the _ lowest _ triplet state in the presence of a _ single screening channel _",
    "@xcite , showing the emergence of a strong kondo enhanced conductance at the crossing point .",
    "alternatively , similar physics can be realized in semiconducting vertical quantum dots , where the magnetic field can be used to tune by orbital effects the splitting between the singlet and the _ three - fold degenerate _",
    "triplet  @xcite ( the zeeman effect can be neglected due to the small g - factor ) . here",
    "the vertical structure preserves the orbital quantum numbers during the tunneling process , so that two screening channel are active , and the high spin states are again fully kondo screened at the crossing point .",
    "one can then naturally wonder about the fate of a singlet to _ degenerate _ triplet crossing in the presence of a _ single _ screening channel @xcite , which can in principle be expected for lateral quantum dots @xcite and molecular devices @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this situation gives rise to both underscreening physics  @xcite and an unscreening singlet - triplet _ quantum phase transition _",
    "( qpt ) . in that case",
    ", a zero - temperature phase transition can take place between a non - magnetic singlet state and a partially compensated spin @xmath0 ( giving an remanent spin @xmath1 in the ground state ) .",
    "the transition is really sharp at zero temperature as the entropy changes from zero ( in the singlet phase ) to @xmath6 in the underscreened kondo phase .",
    "this is in contrast to the so - called singlet - triplet `` transition '' induced by a magnetic field , where the entropy vanishes in both `` phases '' ( as discussed in the previous paragraph ) .",
    "several different theoretical proposals have also been made for the unscreening qpt  @xcite , which was shown to be even robust to valence fluctuations .",
    "our detailed experimental observation @xcite of this singlet - triplet quantum phase transition in a two - electron molecular quantum dot will be one of the main topics of this review , and the various scenarios presented above will be reviewed with more details in the concluding section  [ instabilities ] .",
    "out - of - equilibrium kondo phenomena have also been investigated in two - electron quantum dots , such as kondo - enhanced cotunneling lines at finite bias @xcite , and these will be mentioned later on .",
    "we stress also that spin - orbit interaction has been given some recent attention both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite for even - charge quantum dots , as well as for odd - electron quantum dots @xcite , and these effects could possibly play an important role for the interpretation of some experiments made in semi - conducting quantum dots @xcite .",
    "we also remark that carbon nanotube quantum dots can show a wealth of interesting kondo states due to the enhanced su(4 ) symmetry , both in single and doubly occupied situations , but these system go beyond the present discussion ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a different physical situation occurs when the two orbitals interact with antiferromagnetic exchange . in the case of a single screening channel ,",
    "a two - stage kondo effect occurs for large kondo coupling compared to the interspin exchange .",
    "indeed , after complete kondo screening of the first spin , the resulting fermi liquid state is able to absorb the second spin in a second stage of screening @xcite .",
    "the situation of two screening channels leads potentially to even more exotic physics .",
    "this provides a realization of the so - called two - impurity kondo problem @xcite , which realizes a competition between kondo screening and ( rkky ) exchange and presents a non - trivial quantum phase transition .",
    "the experimental observation of this transition turns out to be difficult @xcite despite previous attempts @xcite , due to relevant physical processes at the non fermi liquid fixed point ( essentially the interdot tunneling ) .    finally , it is also worth noting the complicated role of charge when capacitive coupling between two dots ( or two orbitals ) is relevant @xcite , which can give rise to complex charge skipping in the filling scheme of the dots , a situation not fully elucidated in the presence of spinful electrons .    on a mathematical level",
    ", all the important complexity of these various phenomena can be expressed in complete generality by a two - orbital anderson impurity model , which contains a great deal of physical parameters compared to the single orbital anderson or kondo hamiltonians .",
    "one crucial question is thus to understand what classes of universal behaviors can be expected in such a complicated situation .",
    "going one step further , we also mention that three - orbital models show even more complex and interesting physics , such as non fermi liquid fixed points , a topic that goes far beyond the present review ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a few recent theoretical studies and ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .    on an experimental point of view , multi - orbital effects are always present , but their relevance will depend on many factors , most primarily the energy spacing between the two relevant orbitals , and the structure of the hybridization matrix .",
    "it is clear that disentangling the mechanisms at play from transport measurements only is not an easy task , yet many useful information can be gathered from finite bias cotunneling spectroscopy , possibly in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "the present study will illustrate this general strategy , and show how the magnetic states involved can be identified through an analysis of zeeman split cotunneling lines .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ exp ] will present recent observations made with fullerene quantum dots obtained by electromigration .",
    "these will concern finite bias cotunneling spectroscopy of magnetic states , gate - dependent tuning of singlet and triplet states , the spin @xmath0 underscreened kondo effect , and the unscreening quantum phase transition .",
    "connection to related results in both molecular and semiconducting nanoelectronics will also be made , showing the wide range of application of those ideas .",
    "section [ theo ] will discuss modelization of the problem , and the combined use of near - equilibrium numerical renormalization group calculation and diagrammatic methods in the non - equilibrium situation to reproduce semi -",
    "quantitatively most of the features seen in the experiment .",
    "finally section  [ instabilities ] will close the paper by presenting a more detailed review of the various interesting kondo phenomena involving singlet and triplet excitations in two - electron quantum dots , that will set our observations in a broader perspective .",
    "kondo physics has been widely reported in a variety of quantum dot systems , based on semiconducting heterostructures  @xcite , carbon nanotubes  @xcite and molecular devices  @xcite , showing the great universality of this phenomenon .",
    "usually the kondo effect is best observed for odd charge quantum dots , because the formation of a net spin @xmath1 is always guaranteed in that case ( for even charge dots , the ground state turns out often to be a non - magnetic singlet ) .",
    "while kondo signatures associated to a triplet configuration in two - electron quantum dots was previously observed  @xcite , little attention was devoted to the detailed study of this phenomena .",
    "one reason is that the kondo temperature for spin @xmath0 is generically quite low , making semiconducting systems not suitable to explore this physics .",
    "in contrast , molecular devices display much bigger energy scales , allowing to investigate in great detail the richness of the kondo effect in two - electron quantum dots .",
    "the aim of this paper is to expose the generic and if possible universal features in such two - electron systems , both at the light of experiments on fullerene transistors and also thanks to state - of - the - art many - body simulations .",
    "this section will be devoted to the presentation and discussion of the experiments , while the theory will be presented in sec .",
    "[ theo ] .    in our previous experimental work @xcite , a gate - tuned transition from a low zero - bias conductance state to a high zero - bias conductance state was reported in a molecular quantum dot containing two electrons , see fig .",
    "[ diamond ] .",
    "the data also show a striking collapse of the magnetic excitations on _ both _ sides of the transition , and can thus naturally be explained by the so - called singlet - triplet unscreening quantum phase transition @xcite , where the low conductance regime ( left part of lower panel in fig .  [ diamond ] )",
    "corresponds to a singlet state binding of the molecular orbitals , while the high conductance regime ( right part of lower panel in fig .",
    "[ diamond ] ) is associated to the underscreened kondo effect of a spin @xmath0 triplet .",
    "we note that similar features of kondo anomaly collapse have been reported in other two - electron quantum dot systems  @xcite , but did not show a concomitent crossing of the magnetic excitations .",
    "recent theoretical work @xcite proposed spin - orbit effects ( or more generally magnetic anisotropies ) as a possible alternative interpretation for some of these other experiments .",
    "we will show however that spin - orbit coupling can be neglected in our particular experiment , which is a crucial requirement @xcite for the robustness of our observation of kondo underscreening @xcite .",
    "finally , recent experimental and theoretical studies @xcite have confirmed several microscopic mechanisms at play in the singlet - triplet quantum phase transition , such as the gate tunable hund s rule , giving extra strength to our initial interpretation .",
    "we will refer the reader to our previous work@xcite for the experimental details , and will present in what follows a physical discussion of our observations .",
    "coulomb diamond seen on the upper panel .",
    "singlet / triplet states of the molecule are determined from the absence / presence of a zero bias kondo anomaly , as well as by the zeeman spectroscopy analysis shown in fig .",
    "[ zeeman].,title=\"fig : \" ]   coulomb diamond seen on the upper panel .",
    "singlet / triplet states of the molecule are determined from the absence / presence of a zero bias kondo anomaly , as well as by the zeeman spectroscopy analysis shown in fig .",
    "[ zeeman].,title=\"fig : \" ] +      identifying the molecular magnetic states involved on the quantum dot is certainly a key step in the further interpretation of our transport experiments . because kondo physics results at relatively large tunnel coupling to the electrodes , sequential tunneling lines , occuring along the edges of the coulomb diamonds , are typically very broad and masking the useful information on the allowed transitions from a charge state to the next .",
    "for this reason , cotunneling spectroscopy done within the coulomb diamonds ( hence at fixed charge on the quantum dot ) turns out to be a very useful tool .",
    "because cotunneling spectroscopy reveals transition lines between states with the same charge , their intensity is much weaker than transition with a valence change occuring at the edges of the coulomb diamonds .",
    "this strategy has clear advantages for improving the spectral resolution , but requires at the same time careful experimental measurements , performed at subkelvin temperatures and using efficient filtering of the electric noise .",
    "let us thus focus on the cotunneling lines seen in the even charge coulomb diamond of our experiment ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ diamond ] ) , and study finite bias spectroscopy in a magnetic field . if a spin triplet is really the ground state for large positive gate voltage , as is hinted by the presence of a zero - bias anomaly , it should be split in an obvious manner by the zeeman effect , and magnetic transitions should appear accordingly .",
    "the transport data shown on the right panel of fig .  [ zeeman ] clearly confirms this interpretation , as the selection rules from the ground triplet states to the excited singlet state are precisely the ones expected . similarly , magnetic - field induced transition from the singlet to the lowest triplet is clearly evidenced on the zeeman lines obtained as a function of the magnetic field at fixed gate voltage ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ zeeman ] ) .",
    "this understanding of which states are involved in the experiment provides already useful information for the interpretation and modelization presented in the following .",
    "also , the absence of anticrossings between the magnetic excitations shows that singlet and triplet remain pure spin states .",
    "this points to the absence of spin - orbit effects ( see ref .",
    "@xcite where such effects are evidenced in a self - assembled semiconducting quantum dot and carbon nanotubes respectively ) , which is for instance a crucial point for the robustness @xcite of an underscreened kondo effect ( discussed in section  [ underscreened ] ) .",
    "one striking question should arise at the light of the above analysis : why a magnetic transition can be driven by a change of the electrostatic potential ?",
    "such phenomena , not fully elucidated in our original work @xcite , has received a lot of experimental and theoretical attention recently @xcite and has a simple explanation in terms of molecular levels renormalized by virtual charge fluctuations .    a crucial piece of this puzzle was infact already given in an observation made in our previous work @xcite , namely that under a magnetic field the crossing of the singlet @xmath7 and the lowest @xmath8 triplet does not lead to an enhanced conductance ( as seen in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ zeeman ] ) , in stark constrast to the ( single - channel ) singlet - triplet `` transition '' scenario  @xcite .",
    "this implies that , at the level crossing , the degenerate `` doublet '' \\{@xmath7 , @xmath8 } induced by the magnetic field possesses a vanishingly low kondo temperature .",
    "this necessarily means that the two molecular orbitals @xmath9 must have an _ asymmetric tunneling amplitude _ to the leads , namely @xmath10 , since the effective kondo exchange interaction associated to this pair of states is proportional to @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 the dot charging energy ) .",
    "indeed , a `` spin - flip '' between the singlet and lowest triplet configurations involve tunneling out of orbital 1 and tunneling into orbital 2 ( and vice - versa ) .",
    "now a qualitative argument , analogous to the one proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite for odd charge quantum dots , and based on detailed perturbative calculations in the tunneling amplitude  @xcite , shows that the existence of this orbital tunneling asymmetry is the key to the gate - controlled singlet - triplet splitting .",
    "the basic idea relies on a lowering of the singlet ( resp .",
    "triplet ) energy on the left ( resp .",
    "right ) side of the @xmath13 coulomb diamond by virtual charge fluctuations to the @xmath14 ( resp .",
    "@xmath15 ) neighboring coulomb diamond .",
    "this is due to the fact that the first orbital has indeed a higher probability of tunneling than the second one ( see fig . [ scheme ] ) , so that an energy gain of order @xmath16 can be achieved by either the singlet or the triplet configuration , depending on the proximity to the left or right coulomb diamond respectively .",
    "this hypothesis is in agreement with our previous observation  @xcite of asymmetric tunneling amplitudes , as discussed above , and this simple mechanism explains how a gate - tunable hund s rule can be achieved in our device .        on a more quantitative level , one can also understand why the dispersion of the magnetic states becomes non - linear near the edges of the coulomb diamond , as seen in fig .",
    "[ gatetuned ] .",
    "lowest order perturbation theory in the tunneling events associated to the first orbital provides a correction to the bare singlet - triplet splitting , that diverges logarithmically near the diamond edge @xcite .",
    "this sharp enhancement is clearly responsible for the bending of the magnetic excitation lines near the edge of the coulomb diamonds , and should be expected to be a generic effect .",
    "indeed , such features have now been widely reported , and for illustration purposes we present data on carbone nanotube quantum dots @xcite , taken in the _ odd _ charge sector for a device with _ ferromagnetic _",
    "electrodes , see fig .",
    "[ gatetuned]b . there , the tunneling asymmetry concerns rather the up and down states of the impurity spin @xmath1 ( so that e.g. @xmath17 ) , and in a similar fashion to our findings , leads here to a gate - tuned zeeman effect for these magnetic excitations ( the non - linearity near the diamond edges is also quite apparent in this data set ) .",
    "one can thus infer that a gate - induced singlet - triplet transition can be considered a general effect that will however be observed according to some quantitative criterium : the bare singlet - triplet splitting of the isolated molecule ( that results from the competition of level spacing , coulomb repulsion and hund s rule ) must be smaller than the singlet to triplet energy dispersion that is introduced by the asymmetric coupling to the electrodes .",
    "the singlet - triplet transition can thus only occur at relatively strong hybridization to the leads . in alternative cases where the singlet - triplet splitting turns out to be larger than the hybridization shifts",
    ", the quantum dot keeps intact its magnetic ground state ( singlet or triplet ) throughout the whole coulomb diamond .",
    "this is for instance routinely seen in less strongly coupled quantum dot systems , such as carbon nanotubes @xcite , or our own measurements in other c@xmath18 devices @xcite .      if one focuses on the side of the transition where a kondo ridge is visible ( large positive gate voltage ) , a clear spin @xmath0 kondo anomaly is observed .",
    "one interesting question is the nature of this kondo state , which will crucially depend on the number of active screening channels ( at the temperature where the experiment is performed ) . in the case of two screening channels ,",
    "the spin @xmath0 is fully quenched  @xcite , resulting in a conventional fermi liquid ground state , while for a single screening channel , the spin @xmath0 is partially compensated .",
    "this underscreening process is associated to logarithmic deviations to fermi liquid theory @xcite .",
    "we note that kondo anomalies with even charge states where previously observed , although quite rarely @xcite , in some other semiconducting quantum dot experiments @xcite , and were not studied in great detail .    here , we argue that molecular quantum dots will generically end up in a single screening channel situation , in the sense that the kondo coupling to a second screening bath , although always present , will in general be relatively small ( compared to the most strongly coupled channel ) , so that the associated kondo temperature for a second stage of full screening of the impurity spin will be exponentially small .",
    "several arguments are in favor of this situation : i ) tunneling from the electrodes is typically monomode because the electromigration process is stopped at the breaking up of the metallic contacts ; ii ) coupling of the molecule to the source and drain is also typically quite asymmetric ( conductance maxima of kondo anomalies in molecules range from a few per - thousands to half the conductance quantum @xcite ) ; iii ) the two molecular orbitals involved can also be asymmetrically coupled to the leads , as is seen at least in our device , see discussion in section  [ mechanism ] .    .",
    "]    to explain this more presicely , let us introduce the matrix of tunneling amplitudes  @xcite @xmath19 where we describe our molecular transistor by two orbital levels @xmath9 coupled to two metallic leads @xmath20 with single electronic mode . a screening channel ( @xmath21even , odd ) is associated to each eigenvalue @xmath22 of this matrix , from which antiferromagnetic kondo couplings @xmath23 result between the localized orbitals and the conduction electrons ( @xmath24 is a measure of the addition energy on the molecule ) .",
    "typically the even combination of the wavefunctions results in a larger tunneling term than the odd one , namely @xmath25 , because of generic source / drain ( @xmath26 ) asymmetries , or also orbital level ( @xmath27 ) asymmetries . in turn",
    ", the two exchange interactions will show relatively different magnitudes , @xmath28 , so that a first stage of kondo underscreening of the @xmath0 triplet will occur at temperatures @xmath29 , with @xmath30 the leads density of states .",
    "a second stage of screening of the remanent doublet state will develop only at the much lower temperature @xmath31 , owing to the exponential dependence of the kondo scale in the exchange interaction .",
    "this implies that spin @xmath0 molecular quantum dot experiments covering a couple of decades in temperature will only show underscreening , unless fine - tuning of the tunneling matrix is realized",
    ".    this discussion can be put onto firm ground by making quantitative comparisons of the measured temperature - dependent conductance to numerical renormalization group calculations , see fig .  [ us ] and ref .",
    "@xcite for further details .",
    "the slow saturation of the low temperature conductance for the even charge spin @xmath0 regime , associated to the logarithmic approach to the underscreening fixed point , is readily contrasted to the rapid fermi liquid - like behavior at low temperature for the odd charge spin @xmath1 kondo effect .",
    "this _ quantitative _ comparison gives also more convincing evidence for our observation  @xcite of a quantum phase transition when singlet and triplet states meet at the critical gate voltage .",
    "the sudden disappearance of the underscreened kondo resonance in the middle of the even charge coulomb diamond ( see lower panel in fig .  [ diamond ] ) is the sign of a possible quantum phase transition between two different sorts of ground states . from the identification of the singlet and triplet magnetic states performed in section  [ spectro ] , and the confirmation",
    "that a single screening channel is active ( see discussion in sections  [ mechanism ] and  [ underscreened ] ) , the obvious scenario to follow is the so - called singlet - triplet unscreening transition  @xcite . in this picture , the transition is driven by the merging of singlet and ( underscreened ) triplet magnetic excitations together at a quantum critical point .",
    "the transition is continuous , but shows an entropy change at the zero - temperature critical point : the non - degenerate singlet state can not be smoothly related to a partially screened spin with @xmath6 remanent entropy . because the zero - temperature limit where the transition takes really place is unaccessible to experiments , we discuss the associated signatures of this transition at finite temperature .",
    "we already note that the physics here is more complex than a simple singlet / triplet ( or singlet / doublet ) level crossing , because of the electronic correlations arising from the electrodes , and can not be described by a first order transition .    .",
    "the theoretical calculations are performed for several values of @xmath32 across the qpt , with parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 . in the experimental plot ( upper panel ) , the four lower curves ( associated to low conductance at small bias ) are taken on the singlet side , while the upper curves correspond to the triplet side .",
    ", width=340 ]    the upper panel of figure  [ didv ] shows previously unpublished results for the non - linear conductance measured for several gate voltages across the transition .",
    "far on the singlet side ( for gate voltages @xmath391.87v ) , a well formed gap opens up in transport , showing the strong binding of the molecular levels into a tight singlet unit .",
    "yet an out - of - equilibrium enhancement of the cotunneling lines ( to the triplet excitations ) is witnessed  @xcite , similar to previous observations made in carbon nanotubes  @xcite . upon approaching the transition ( for gate voltages 1.88v@xmath401.9v ) , the finite bias shoulder progressively disperses towards zero bias , while a slower logarithmic - like decrease of the conductance is now observed instead of a hard singlet gap .",
    "these features can be explained within the singlet - triplet scenario @xcite by a two - stage kondo process for the formation of the singlet ground state , as demonstrated by the complex temperature dependence of the non - linear conductance , see fig .",
    "[ singletside ] .",
    "the physical interpretation of these data is the following  @xcite : at high - temperatures , the two - orbitals act basically as two decoupled spin @xmath1 , and the most strongly coupled spin undergoes a first screening process associated to a kondo scale @xmath41 , while the more weakly coupled spin remains essentially free .",
    "this is witnessed in fig .",
    "[ singletside ] by the formation of a standard kondo anomaly ( with maximum conductance at zero bias ) for temperatures @xmath42mk . by further cooling ,",
    "interaction between the remaining unscreened spin and the fermi sea builds up via the already screened @xmath1 moment , and leads to a second stage of screening that fully quenches the total entropy . by adiabatic continuity to the singlet state realized far from the transition , the conductance can be shown to drop to small values , so that a kondo - like dip is seen in transport associated to a second kondo scale @xmath43 .",
    "the presence of two different energy scales is clearly shown in fig",
    ".  [ singletside ] , while the crossover from strong singlet binding to the kondo - like singlet binding appears by the change from a hard gap to a softer pseudogap in fig .",

    "we also assume that a single channel couples to the impurity states , which seems also the case in the experiment , otherwise the underscreened kondo effect would be spoiled at low temperatures .",

    "each of the orbitals are made asymmetric , in agreement with general experimental observations of this phenomenon@xcite .",

    "finite bias cotunneling features , with sharp kondo - like enhancement , are obtained thanks to optimized broadening methods  @xcite . the zero - bias kondo anomaly for gate voltages @xmath139",
    "is associated to the underscreening of the triplet state , while a sharp gap occurs on the singlet side of the transition for @xmath140 . ]",
    "we finally focus the discussion on the charge @xmath13 configuration , for which the fine structures are given in fig .",
    "the singlet - triplet unscreening transition is first evidenced by the obvious dichotomy in the low bias transport properties : a low conductance state in the singlet sector ( gate voltage @xmath141 is replaced by a highly conducting spin @xmath0 kondo anomaly in the triplet sector .",
    "concomitantly , a clear crossing of excited states occurs precisely at the quantum critical point .",
    "these cotunneling lines show sharp kondo - like enhancement , as discussed previously with respect to both the experimental data ( sec .",
    "[ exp ] ) and the diagrammatic calculations ( sec .  [ diagram ] ) . clearly , the inclusion of the charge @xmath14 state in the nrg simulations allows us to recover the correct enhancement of the satellites on the singlet side as the gate voltage is decreased towards the diamond edge .",
    "this property is also crucial to obtain theoretically the bending of the cotunneling line near the edge , that is also clearly seen in the experiment ( see fig .",
    "[ gatetuned ] ) . on a technical level , we emphasize that such numerical plot requires to perform the broadening of the nrg raw data with the so - called b - trick  @xcite , otherwise the cotunneling lines are barely resolved . on a more physical ground ,",
    "we have checked by varrying the microscopic parameters of the model that the gate - induced singlet - triplet transition remains robust , as long as the bare singlet - triplet gap does not overcome the energy gain associated to the asymmetric tunneling probabilities ( in agreement with the general discussion in sec .",
    "[ mechanism ] ) .",
    "this observation highlights the singlet - triplet transition as an almost _ generic _ feature of two - electron quantum dots .",
    "we would like to finish by a general discussion of the possible mechanisms that can drive instabilities in quantum dots with two electrons , in cases where only unique singlet and triplet states are involved .",
    "several scenarios can be distinguished , whether a single or two screening channels are active , and depending if a zeeman effect splits the triplet levels or not .",
    "the additional role of magnetic anisotropies due to spin - orbit coupling will also be considered .",
    "we will start by discussing the situation of the so - called singlet / triplet `` transition '' , which is rather a magnetic - field induced kondo effect due to the extra degeneracy achieved at the crossing of singlet and triplet states .",
    "several proposals for this effect have been made , and we present first the simplest one , which involves a zeeman - split triplet , in the single channel case @xcite . the role of the magnetic field here is to create an effective doublet by bringing the lowest triplet state in degeneracy with the singlet state ( see panel a in fig .",
    "[ st_transition_1ck ] ) .",
    "this effective doublet is then screened by the conduction electrons in a standard kondo process , giving rise to a single - channel kondo scale @xmath2 , while deviations from the crossing point ( a role played by the singlet - triplet splitting @xmath142 ) act as an effective magnetic field ( see panel b in fig .  [ st_transition_1ck ] ) . as this energy scale becomes larger than @xmath2 ,",
    "the kondo resonance is killed , and the linear conductance decreases ( see panel f in fig .",
    "[ st_transition_1ck ] ) . clearly , there is no quantum phase transition in this problem , but rather smooth crossovers when the two relevant energy scales match together ( see panel c in fig .",
    "[ st_transition_1ck ] ) .",
    "this is because the ground state remains a spin singlet ( zero entropy state ) throughout the whole phase diagram .",
    "this of course is true including the degeneracy point , because kondo screening quenches the entropy of the doublet ( see panel d in fig .",
    "[ st_transition_1ck ] ) .",
    "we finally note that this effect has been studied experimentally in carbon nanotube quantum dots  @xcite , and should be observable typically in molecular devices as well , due to the higher g - factor compared to semiconducting systems .",
    "clearly our device @xcite , taken on the singlet side and with a strong magnetic field , satisfies most of the conditions for this scenario ( see the similarity of panel b in fig .",
    "[ zeeman ] and panel e in fig .",
    "[ st_transition_1ck ] ) .",
    "however , the kondo enhanced crossing of the singlet and lowest triplet predicted above @xcite is clearly missing in our experiment , because the two orbitals seem to be quite asymmetrically coupled to the leads , so that the resulting kondo temperature is extremely low .",
    "an alternative scenario for the singlet - triplet transition , which involves different degrees of freedom ( namely a singlet and a _ three - fold degenerate _",
    "triplet ) has also been considered  @xcite , following experiments in vertical quantum dots  @xcite . in that case , orbital quantum numbers are conserved during the tunneling processes , so that two screening channel are active .",
    "the control parameter here is a perpendicular magnetic field , which by orbital effects tunes the singlet - triplet gap ( see panel a in fig .  [ st_transition_2ck ] ) .        due to the presence of _ two _ screening channels ,",
    "the triplet phase is fully screened ( this remains true at the degeneracy point , where a su(2)@xmath143su(2 ) state is generated ) , so that the ground state entropy remains zero at all values of the magnetic field , and again crossovers rather than quantum phase transition are expected ( see panels c and d in fig .",
    "[ st_transition_2ck ] ) .",
    "because the triplet phase involves a kondo process , the kondo temperature is enhanced compared to the singlet phase ( see panel b in fig .",
    "[ st_transition_2ck ] ) .",
    "the low - temperature conductance thus shows an asymmetric maximum as a function of magnetic field ( see panel f in fig .",
    "[ st_transition_2ck ] ) , which distinguishes this case from the single channel situation discussed previously .",
    "we note that magnetic transitions appear also differently ( compare panel e in fig .  [ st_transition_1ck ] and fig .",
    "[ st_transition_2ck ] ) .",
    "the situation that we have examined in our experiment  @xcite is markedly different from the two scenarios discussed before : the gate - tuned singlet - triplet transition involves the crossing of a singlet with a _ three - fold _ degenerate triplet ( see panel a in fig .",
    "[ st_qpt ] ) in the presence of a _ single _ screening channel .",
    "the physics is then more exotic on several accounts .",
    "first , the triplet phase displays an underscreened kondo effect  @xcite , so that a zero - bias peak coexists with the finite bias singlet excitations ( see lower panel in fig .",
    "[ diamond ] and panel e in fig .",
    "[ st_qpt ] ) .",
    "we have later on confirmed in detail this underscreened state , see discusion in sec .",
    "[ underscreened ] and ref .",
    "because of the partial screening of the @xmath0 spin , the entropy of the triplet phase saturates to @xmath6 at low temperature , so that there is an entropy change to zero at the singlet - triplet crossing ( see panel d in fig .  [ st_qpt ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to a zero temperature singlet - triplet quantum phase transition @xcite , which is manifested by a step like behavior of the linear conductance as a function of gate voltage ( see panel f in fig .",
    "[ st_qpt ] ) .",
    "the situation on the singlet side close to the quantum critical point is also intriguing , because singlet and triplet states are released into two independent spin @xmath1 , that are screened in a two - stage kondo process .",
    "the resulting energy scales and the associated scenario are given on panel b and c in fig .",
    "[ st_qpt ] respectively .",
    "one can also understand the singlet - triplet qpt by an unscreening transition , where the underscreened kondo phase corresponds to the ferromagnetic side of an _ effective _",
    "@xmath1 kondo model , while the singlet binding is associated to a kondo screening process ( antiferromagnetic side in the effective model ) @xcite , see the schematic flow diagram in fig .",
    "[ flow ] .",
    "we comment here on the effect of a magnetic field onto the underscreened @xmath0 kondo state .",
    "the standard ( fully screened ) @xmath1 kondo state , governed by fermi liquid theory , is known to present a threshold in magnetic field ( of the order of the kondo temperature ) at which the finite bias conductance exhibits a splitting  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we have found both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite that the underscreened state has a dramatic sensitivity to magnetic field , due to the finite @xmath6 entropy in the ground state , see fig .",
    "[ usk_zeeman ] . in that case , the non - linear conductance splits ( at zero temperature ) for arbitrarily small values of the magnetic field .",
    "we end up by a discussion of possible relevant perturbations to the physics discussed above , that are related to spin orbit interactions .",
    "recent experiments @xcite and theoretical works @xcite have demonstrated that magnetic anisotropies can strongly affect the nature of the magnetic states in a two - electron quantum dot .",
    "let us consider the addition of a magnetic anisotropy term @xmath144 , which splits the triplet into unpolarized @xmath145 and polarized @xmath146 states ( see panel a in fig .  [ spinorbit_qpt ] ) .",
    "the experiment by parks _",
    "@xcite corresponds precisely to the situation of @xmath147 , where a spin @xmath0 kondo anomaly is progressively destroyed by lowering in energy the unpolarized state , so that the conductance is suppressed ( see panel f in fig .",
    "[ spinorbit_qpt ] ) .",
    "this is experimentally realized by tuning the magnetic anisotropy with a stretching of their molecule , and this realizes the schematic flow diagram in fig .",
    "in contrast to our experiment where the underscreened kondo was associated to a whole phase of the flow diagram , the parks experiment realizes the underscreened kondo as a quantum critical point associated to a kosterlitz - thouless qpt .",
    "however , the doublet phase corresponding to @xmath148 was not accessible in this experiment , so that the qpt was not fully examined . as was noted previously  @xcite , the magnetic anisotropy term is less relevant than the zeeman splitting discussed in the previous paragraph and in our work  @xcite , leading to a threshold behavior at @xmath149 for the splitting of the non - linear conductance ( very similar to the zeeman effect in @xmath1 quantum dots ) .",
    "this effect is quite clearly observed in the data of parks _ et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "we finally note that some of the data with semiconducting quantum dots with two electrons @xcite are likely to display some degree of spin - orbit effects , although this is not yet fully clarified ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent discussion ) .",
    "we have shown in this review that several striking phenomena in two - electron quantum dots ( gate - dependent hund s rule , singlet - triplet unscreening quantum phase transition and underscreened kondo effect ) can be explained in a coherent picture at the light of the experimental data obtained from a molecular transistor .",
    "extensive numerical renormalization group simulations as well as out - of - equilibrium diagrammatic calculations were used to confirm quasi - quantitatively these observations .",
    "we argued that many of the observed features can be considered as generic for molecular devices , in the absence of strong spin - orbit effects .",
    "one crucial and common ingredient is the presence of a single active screening channel in the accessible temperature range , which is granted by the asymmetric hybridization between orbital and leads .",
    "this is expected to be satisfied in most devices , and indeed gate - dependence of the magnetic excitations has been reported in _ all kinds _ of quantum dot systems : semi - conducting devices @xcite , carbon nanotubes @xcite , several kinds of molecules @xcite .",
    "the singlet - triplet quantum phase transition @xcite imposes however a further experimental requirement , namely a small bare singlet - triplet splitting , in order to allow the gating effect to overcome it .",

    "<S> we review here some universal aspects of the physics of two - electron molecular transistors in the absence of strong spin - orbit effects . </S>",
    "<S> several recent quantum dots experiments have shown that an _ electrostatic _ </S>",
    "<S> backgate could be used to control the energy dispersion of _ magnetic _ levels . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how the generically asymmetric coupling of the metallic contacts to two different molecular orbitals can indeed lead to a _ gate - tunable hund s rule _ in the presence of singlet and triplet states in the quantum dot . for gate voltages such that the singlet constitutes the ( non - magnetic ) ground state , one generally observes a suppression of low voltage transport , which can yet be restored in the form of enhanced cotunneling features at finite bias . </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly , when the gate voltage is controlled to obtain the triplet configuration , spin @xmath0 kondo anomalies appear at zero - bias , with non - fermi liquid features related to the underscreening of a spin larger than 1/2 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the small bare singlet - triplet splitting in our device allows to fine - tune with the gate between these two magnetic configurations , leading to an unscreening quantum phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> this transition occurs between the non - magnetic singlet phase , where a two - stage kondo effect occurs , and the triplet phase , where the partially compensated ( underscreened ) moment is akin to a magnetically `` ordered '' state . </S>",
    "<S> these observations are put theoretically into a consistent global picture by using new numerical renormalization group simulations , taylored to capture sharp finie - voltage cotunneling features within the coulomb diamonds , together with complementary out - of - equilibrium diagrammatic calculations on the two - orbital anderson model . </S>",
    "<S> this work should shed further light on the complicated puzzle still raised by multi - orbital extensions of the classic kondo problem .    </S>",
    "<S> mkbothtopical review </S>"
