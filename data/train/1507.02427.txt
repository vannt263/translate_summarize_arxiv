    "rydberg atoms are promising for quantum information processing due to their strong and highly tunable interaction properties @xcite .",
    "high fidelity quantum gates and coherent state transfer between rydberg and long living ground states have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the fidelity of these operations is , however , fundamentally limited by the finite lifetime of rydberg states @xcite . besides the natural decay of the rydberg excitation ,",
    "blackbody radiation induced transitions @xcite , collisions @xcite , and superradiance @xcite may also limit the lifetime .",
    "the characterization of the rydberg state decay is thus of significant interest .    for individual rydberg atoms at an environment temperature",
    "@xmath5 the lifetime of an excited state is given by the inverse sum over all spontaneous decay rates into lower lying states @xcite .",
    "due to the highest energy difference , the lowest lying states contribute most to the decay .",
    "this is a limiting factor for calculations because the potentials for low - lying states can not be described as accurately as those of higher states , which become more and more hydrogen - like with increasing @xmath6 and @xmath7 quantum numbers . in a finite temperature environment ,",
    "blackbody radiation ( bbr ) induced transitions occur .",
    "the strongest transitions are those to nearby dipole - allowed rydberg states both above and below in energy . for a perfect planck photon distribution and well - known temperature",
    "the corresponding rates can be calculated with high accuracy @xcite .",
    "the experimental verification of bbr induced transition rates is possible not only through rydberg lifetime measurements @xcite but also indirectly by e.g. measurements of stark maps @xcite , which depend on the same dipole matrix elements .",
    "any incoherent re - population of the originally excited rydberg state by multiple bbr transitions can be easily included into theoretical models , but is usually negligible in magnitude .",
    "also , blackbody - induced ionization by transitions to continuum states can be taken into account @xcite .",
    "direct lifetime measurements at lowered environment temperatures , as well as measurements of temperature - dependent bbr transfer rates , have been conducted for na atoms @xcite .",
    "the most accurate values for rb rydberg lifetimes to date have been measured in a room temperature environment , relying on the knowledge of bbr transition rates in order to extract zero - temperature natural lifetimes .",
    "measurements of @xmath8 and @xmath9 states in the range of @xmath10 were conducted by exciting rydberg atoms from a cloud of ultracold atoms prepared in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) , waiting some varying delay time , and then applying an electric field pulse while monitoring the time - dependent ionization signals ( selective field ionization , sfi ) @xcite . due to the difficulty of accurately distinguishing between close lying rydberg states which are populated because of bbr ( see discussion @xcite ) ,",
    "the technique was improved in @xcite . by adding a microwave transfer of the `` target '' rydberg atoms to a higher - lying state which can be accurately discriminated , this potential source of systematic error",
    "was eliminated .",
    "the results of @xcite generally agree with the previous work and cover rb @xmath8 , @xmath11 , and @xmath9 states in the range @xmath12 . to our knowledge ,",
    "neither lifetimes of rb at lowered environment temperatures , nor any bbr transition rates , have yet been measured .",
    "consequently , an experimental verification of the bbr rate calculations @xcite for rb is still required .    in general",
    ", the lifetime of rydberg atoms in ultracold gases is altered by several effects .",
    "any electric fields lead to state mixing and ionization @xcite . collisions between atoms , as well as dipole - dipole and higher order interaction between rydberg atoms , which may also lead to collisions @xcite , cause changes of the atomic states and ionization @xcite . furthermore",
    ", depending on atomic density and cloud geometry , microwave superradiance is likely to occur , which can be triggered by blackbody radiation @xcite . due to such effects",
    ", the lifetimes of rydberg atoms can differ greatly from the undisturbed values , as well as from one experiment to another .",
    "therefore , the measurement of rydberg lifetimes under the given conditions is necessary .",
    "while the sfi methods mentioned above can be used when an electron / ion detector is present , an increasing number of recent cold atom experiments rely solely on optical detection , mostly employing electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) instead @xcite . in order to enable the determination of rydberg lifetimes in such systems , as well as in cases where a reduced complexity of the setup , compared to the sfi approach with the additional microwave , is desired",
    ", we developed a similarly powerful , all - optical method for measuring state - specific lifetimes .",
    "the approach is technologically simplified as the same lasers that are used for rydberg excitation are employed for detection , requiring only an additional photodiode for the measurement of resonant absorption .",

    "the experimental sequence , aimed at measuring changes in the optical density due to the laser pulses , consists of several steps . in each step , a cloud of ultracold atoms is prepared , released from the trap , and after a given time of flight a series of laser pulses depending on the current step is applied , as shown in fig .",

    "the value of @xmath27 in the beginning is the fraction of atoms that have been excited to the rydberg state , except for transitions to other states that have already happened due to bbr and possible superradiance , as was noted in @xcite .",
    "the whole @xmath27 curve represents an effective decay of all directly and indirectly excited states , which is nearly , but generally not perfectly , exponential in shape because of the differing lifetimes of the constituent rydberg states that become populated .",

    "the resulting @xmath28 is a measure for the strength of any ionizing effects , if other mechanisms can be excluded that specifically remove rydberg atoms , but not ground state atoms , from the detection volume , or , alternatively , transfer them into other stable states outside the probe transition . in general",
    ", the decay curve must consist of the ( as yet unknown ) parts @xmath29 i.e. the population of the originally excited rydberg state , other rydberg states , and the number of ionized atoms .    in order to separate the decay of the originally excited rydberg state @xmath16 from others that become populated , a state transfer similar to the microwave transfer in @xcite",
    "is employed in step iv .",
    "however , instead of the additional microwave , the same rydberg laser which was used for the excitation is used for a short optical pumping pulse at various times @xmath21 during the expected decay of @xmath16 .",
    "this pumps a fraction of atoms still in the @xmath16 state down to the intermediate @xmath15 state . during this pulse ,",
    "the probe laser needs to be turned off to prevent any re - excitation of the rydberg state .",
    "because the lifetime of the intermediate state is short , the atoms pumped back in this fashion will reappear as ground state atoms as soon as the probe laser is turned on again after the optical pumping pulse .",
    "following the same evaluation procedure as for step iii , using and , decay curves @xmath30 can be obtained .",
    "these must consist of the same parts with equal values as , except for a change in @xmath31 at @xmath32 , which has been reduced by some fraction @xmath33 by the optical pumping pulse due to the rydberg population in @xmath16 at time @xmath34 , leaving @xmath35 thus , by subtracting the decay curves @xmath30 from the curve without optical pumping @xmath36 of step iii , information about the original @xmath16 population at time @xmath34 can be obtained : @xmath37 as long as the optical density of the rydberg atoms for the rydberg laser is small or the optical pumping is fast enough to transfer all of the @xmath16 atoms ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath33 will be a constant fraction for each @xmath21",
    ". repetition of step iv for different @xmath21 and evaluation of @xmath39 yields the decay of the population @xmath40 , giving the lifetime of the rydberg state @xmath16 . in case",
    "only spontaneous decay and bbr contribute to the lifetime , this will be an exponential decay with a decay parameter @xmath41 independent of @xmath33 .",
    "we employed the method in a series of experiments in a setup where a cloud of @xmath2rb atoms with a temperature of is transferred into a gap of the radiation shield of a tunable temperature cryostat by means of optical tweezers ( detailed in @xcite ) .",

    "our result is well compatible .",
    "however , while in our measurements there is a clear tendency for increased lifetimes at lowered temperatures the effect is not as pronounced as expected from the calculated values from @xcite , giving @xmath71 at @xmath72 . in order to check for any systematic dependencies on geometrical effects arising due to the falling and expanding cloud , as well as the presence of any density - dependent lifetime reducing effects ,",
    "the measurements for @xmath3 were repeated with a time of flight of @xmath73 .",
    "this resulted in an increase of the atom density and the optical density by roughly a factor of 2 .",
    "the resulting lifetimes for @xmath3 were @xmath74 ( @xmath65 ) up to @xmath75 ( @xmath67 ) , i.e. no discernible difference compared to the tof @xmath76 measurements .",
    "therefore , we suspect insufficient shielding from outside thermal radiation in our setup as the main cause for the discrepancy in comparison to theory at low temperatures . the geometry as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] leads to a solid angle of @xmath77 covered by cold surfaces . also , the lower part of the radiation shield is not ideally thermally coupled to the cryostat and is estimated to be at least @xmath78 warmer than the upper surface at temperatures near @xmath79 , causing the effective temperature relevant for bbr to be significantly higher than the cryostat temperature .",
    "the lifetime of the @xmath4 state , with a tof of @xmath55 , was measured to be @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) and @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) , much lower than the reference value of @xmath84 ( @xmath85 , fig . 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "this lifetime reduction comes as no surprise , due to the interaction - induced ionizing collisions already observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : notg_decay ] .",
    "the time resolution of the method presented in sec . [ sec : method ] is limited by the length and timing accuracy of the excitation and optical pumping pulses , effectively adding uncertainty to times @xmath19 and @xmath21 . for our @xmath86 pulses with a timing accuracy of @xmath87 ,",
    "this results in a systematic uncertainty of @xmath61 common to all measurements taken under the same excitation conditions , limiting their absolute , but not differential accuracy .",
    "higher laser intensities , particularly of the rydberg laser , would allow for shorter pulses .",
    "when choosing the sizes for both laser beams , geometry effects need to be considered : if there is any significant atomic motion due to time of flight or atomic temperature , the excitation volume should be smaller than the detection volume , in order to avoid any rydberg atoms leaving the detection volume during the measurement time .",
    "however , the measured rydberg signal will be lower for increased detection volumes , affecting the signal - to - noise ratio . furthermore , prolonged acceleration of the atoms due to radiation pressure will lead to doppler shifts which can lead to systematical errors , especially with regard to the narrow rydberg transitions .",
    "this is particularly relevant for the probe laser , which must be well below the saturation intensity of the probe transition ( @xmath88 in our experiments ) .",
    "if , like in our experiments , the pulses are created using an acousto - optical modulator ( aom ) in the laser beam path , the probe pulse will have a certain switching time of @xmath89 and will show intensity drifts resulting from polarization drifts during some device - dependent warm - up time .",
    "as long as the signal remains proportional to the light level seen by the atoms , and the pulse shapes are well reproducible , these drifts cancel out when calculating the @xmath90 terms .",
    "the optical density itself will not be constant over the duration of the laser pulse , since the atomic cloud is expanding , as well as being accelerated downwards by gravity , however , these effects cancel out as well in @xmath36 .",
    "the measured optical densities depend on the probe light polarization and zeeman substates of the atoms . for low rabi frequencies , optical pumping effects can become visible in the dynamic parts of the measured signals , particularly when turning the probe laser back on after the rydberg laser pulses at times @xmath21 , which in turn limits the accuracy of the determination of @xmath91 .",
    "these effects become especially pronounced when any stray magnetic fields split up the zeeman sublevels , which would need to be compensated well below the magnitude of the earth magnetic field for high accuracy .",
    "stray electric fields , if sufficiently strong , would additionally lead to state mixing affecting the underlying physical lifetime of the measured state . according to our calculations ( detailed in @xcite ) this would become relevant on a ( probability ) level at for the @xmath92 state and for @xmath93 , i.e. not leading to significant state mixing in our setup",
    ".    regarding the measurements taken at a lowered environment temperature , mainly two sources of systematic error need to be taken into account : first , as mentioned before , and discussed in @xcite , the effective temperature as seen by the atoms will not be the temperature of the cryostat unless the full @xmath94 solid angle is covered .",
    "second , the geometry of conducting parts of the experimental setup , like the radiation shield of the cryostat , can form an effective microwave resonator altering the bbr spectrum .",
    "this becomes especially relevant if their dimensions are close to the strongest transition wavelengths ( like the @xmath95 with a wavelength of , or @xmath96 with ) .",
    "we have presented an optical method for the measurement of rydberg atom lifetimes , providing information about how they are influenced by effects like blackbody radiation and interactions between rydberg atoms . due to the fact that no detector parts or high voltages are needed inside the vacuum chamber of the experimental setup",
    "this method might prove particularly useful in otherwise complex systems , including atom chip setups such as the one used here @xcite , or millikelvin systems @xcite , that might eventually lead to the realization of proposed quantum gate schemes as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "while the use of an additional microwave population transfer as in @xcite is not necessary for state selectivity it might be employed to measure the populations of neighboring rydberg @xmath97 and @xmath98 states by generalizing the scheme to measure signal differences due to the microwave transfer . this way , both the populations of e.g. a rydberg @xmath0 and close - lying @xmath97 states could be monitored .",
    "this would , for example , allow for the distinction between superradiance , which highly depends on the population of such strongly coupled states , and other lifetime - reducing effects .",
