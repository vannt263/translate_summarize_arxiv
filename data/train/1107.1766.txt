    "thermodynamic properties of non - equilibrium stationary states are poorly understood .",
    "they are usually characterized by currents of conserved quantities , such as energy , flowing through the system . when stationary states are _ close _ to equilibrium states , linear response theory is effective and explains common macroscopic phenomena like fourier s law : in a system in contact with two thermostats at different temperatures , the heat flux is proportional to the temperature gradient ( as long as the relative difference between the two temperatures is small ) .",
    "in contrast , there is no general theory to describe systems in a stationary state _ far _ from equilibrium , and the corresponding macroscopic properties seem to depend on the specific details of the dynamics .    in this article , we investigate numerically the energy transport properties of a simple one - dimensional system , a chain of @xmath0  rotors , in a stationary state far from equilibrium .",
    "many studies considered one - dimensional chains of oscillators subjected to a temperature gradient  @xcite . here",
    "we consider both thermal and mechanical forcings , obtained as follows : the leftmost rotor is attached to a wall and put in contact with a langevin thermostat at temperature @xmath1 , while the rightmost rotor is subjected to a constant external force @xmath2 and put in contact with another langevin thermostat at temperature @xmath3 .",
    "what we observe in our numerical experiments is that _ the combined effect of these two generalized forces can reduce the current instead of increasing it_. this counterintuitive effect is observed for large mechanical forcings @xmath2 , when @xmath3 is increased while @xmath1 remains fixed ( see figure  [ fig : tlfixed ] below ) .",
    "the mechanical forcing induces a negative current ( from the right to the left ) .",
    "when @xmath3 is increased while @xmath1 remains fixed , one would naively expect that the ( negative ) thermal forcing is also larger , and thus that the negative current should be ( in absolute value ) larger .",
    "in contrast to this expectation , we observe that , in this case , the current is _ reduced_.",
    "this strange effect does not appear if , instead , @xmath1 is lowered and @xmath3 is fixed ( see figure  [ fig : trfixed ] below ) , in which case the current indeed becomes larger in absolute value .",
    "we are unable to provide explanations to the above described phenomena .",
    "we believe that such behaviors show the complexity of non - equilibrium stationary states far from equilibrium , and also suggest that fourier s law is only valid close to equilibrium",
    ". a naive extension of the definition of thermal conductivity to genuinely non - equilibrium settings can give negative values to this quantity ( whence the somehow provocative title of this article ) .    in the sequel of this article",
    ", we first describe the system we work with , and the numerical integrator we have used ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : description ] ) .",
    "we next turn to studying various properties of the system . in particular",
    ", we numerically check that local equilibrium holds for systems large enough , despite the fact that , globally , the system is out of equilibrium ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : local ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : current ] , we study how the current depends on the magnitude of the mechanical force and on the temperatures that are imposed on both ends of the chain .",
    "all these numerical studies are performed for chains of increasing lengths .",
    "the configuration of the system is described by the positions ( angles ) @xmath4 of the rotors , which belong to the one - dimensional torus @xmath5 , as well as their associated ( angular ) momenta @xmath6 .",
    "the masses of the particles are set to  1 for simplicity .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath7,\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath8 for @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we consider a system with free boundary conditions on the right end , whose evolution equations read : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are independent standard wiener processes , and @xmath14 determines the strength of the coupling to the thermostat . in the sequel , we work with @xmath15 .",
    "note that the external constant force @xmath2 is non - gradient since it does not derive from a periodic potential .",
    "we checked the robustness of the results we describe below with respect to the choice of boundary conditions .",
    "we indeed also considered fixed boundary conditions on the right end ( this amounts to adding an extra force @xmath16 to the last atom ) . in particular , we checked that our counterintuitive results on the behavior of the thermal current as a function of the strength of the nongradient force are still observed with these boundary conditions .      if @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the system is in _ equilibrium _ , and the unique stationary measure is given by the gibbs measure at temperature @xmath19 associated with the hamiltonian  .",
    "when @xmath20 with @xmath17 , the properties of the non - equilibrium stationary state have been studied numerically by various authors  @xcite .",
    "the thermal conductivity of the system , defined as the stationary energy current multiplied by the size of the system and divided by the temperature difference  @xcite , has a finite limit for large system sizes , even though the rotor chain is a momentum conserving one - dimensional system  @xcite .",
    "besides , as the average temperature @xmath19 increases above the value  0.5 , the thermal conductivity decreases dramatically  @xcite .    if @xmath21 , the system is out - of - equilibrium even if @xmath22 ( recall indeed that @xmath2 is non - gradient ) .",
    "the force , in the stationary state , induces an energy current towards the left .",
    "the stationary state can not be computed explicitly and , if @xmath2 is large , linear response theory can not be used to obtain information about the conductivity of the system .    if @xmath23 , there are two mechanisms that _ separately _ generate an energy current towards the left of the system : the mechanical force @xmath2 and the thermal force given by the temperature gradient .",
    "it seems however difficult to separate the contributions of each mechanism .",
    "the numerical experiments reported below show that these two mechanisms are not necessarily additive , and that one mechanism may reduce the effect of the other one , leading to counterintuitive results .",
    "the numerical integration of   is performed using a splitting strategy where the hamiltonian part of the evolution is integrated with the verlet scheme  @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation parts , with the additional non - gradient force , are ornstein - uhlenbeck processes and can thus be integrated analytically .",
    "we have thus used the following algorithm : @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is given by  . in turn ,",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 are independent normal gaussian random variables .",
    "recall also that the friction parameter @xmath31 is set to  1 .",
    "the three first lines of the above algorithm consist in exactly integrating the ornstein - uhlenbeck processes on @xmath32 and @xmath33 , whereas the three last lines are based on the standard verlet algorithm .",
    "the time - step @xmath34 ensures that the energy conservation in the verlet scheme is accurate enough .",
    "while there might be some time - step bias in the value of the currents , the qualitative conclusions are robust with respect to the choice of the time - step .",
    "this section is organized as follows .",
    "first , we discuss the existence of a stationary measure for the dynamics  . under the assumption that such a stationary measure exists ,",
    "we establish some relations that are consistent with physical intuition .",
    "we next point out that this system shows some very surprising features .",
    "for instance , the temperature profile is non - monotonic and a maximum is observed in the center of the system , while the velocity profiles are very nonlinear . despite these nonlocal features , we show that local equilibrium holds .",
    "we finally turn to investigating the dependence of the stationary energy current on @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "we believe that there exists a unique smooth stationary measure for the dynamics",
    ". however , as far as we know , there is no rigorous result in this direction for rotor chains , even in the case @xmath35 .",
    "indeed , the standard techniques ( see for instance  @xcite ) used to prove existence and uniqueness of an invariant measure for chains of oscillators under thermal forcing do not apply here .",
    "a possible pathology for rotor chains is that the ( internal ) energy concentrates locally on one or several rotors , which rotate faster and faster .",
    "since the interaction forces are bounded , it may not be possible to prevent this fast rotation . in practice ,",
    "we have not observed such catastrophes in the parameter regime we considered , but the kinetic temperature profiles presented in figure  [ fig : temperature ] ( obtained from the variance of the momenta , with the previously mentioned caveat on the interpretation of this quantity ) are quite unexpected and show that the internal energy tends to be larger in the middle of the chain .",
    "this picture also allows to understand what happens when the imposed temperatures at the right and left ends change : the maximal temperature in the chain is almost unchanged , but the position of the maximum is displaced .",
    "this shows that the linear response correction to the stationary measure is necessarily _",
    "nonlocal_. such nonlocal effects were already observed in nonequilibrium exclusion processes  @xcite .",
    "kinetic temperature profiles for chains of length @xmath36 , with @xmath37 and different temperature gradients . ]    some interesting relations can nonetheless be obtained under the assumption that the stationary state exists .",
    "we denote by @xmath38 the expectation with respect to the stationary measure .",
    "first , a constant profile of force settles down in the bulk . taking expectations in",
    "indeed gives @xmath39 this leads to the following profile : @xmath40 for all @xmath41 , while @xmath42 .",
    "the balance between the average work done by the force and the energy dissipated by the thermostats is given by @xmath43 as can be seen by noticing that the average variation of the total energy  @xmath28 is zero .",
    "moreover , the entropy production inequality ( obtained by computing the variations of the relative entropy with respect to the invariant measure , see e.g.  @xcite ) gives @xmath44 in the case @xmath18 , this relation , combined with  , yields @xmath45 .",
    "therefore the stationary momentum on the right end has the same sign as the driving force , as expected .",
    "figure  [ fig : velocities ] shows that the momentum profile is not linear , and that its derivative is maximal where , according to figure  [ fig : temperature ] , temperature is maximal .",
    "we also observe on figure  [ fig : thermo_limit ] ( top ) that the profile seems to become steeper in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "average momenta for chains of length @xmath36 , with @xmath46 . ]",
    "a very interesting question is whether nonequilibrium systems are _ locally _ close to equilibrium .",
    "this issue was considered in  @xcite for systems subjected to thermal forcings only .",
    "we check the local equilibrium assumption in three steps .",
    "a.   we study the agreement between the local kinetic temperature ( defined as the variance of the velocities ) and the local potential temperature .",
    "the latter is obtained as follows .",
    "first , we numerically precompute the function @xmath47 which , to a given temperature , associates the canonical average of the potential energy @xmath48 of one bond . the local potential temperature at bond @xmath49 is then defined as the value @xmath50 such that @xmath51 is equal to the time average of the potential energy of the bond @xmath52 along the trajectory defined by  . the results presented in figure  [ fig : thermo_limit ] ( bottom )",
    "show that the two local temperatures are quite different for small systems , but are identical for larger ones .",
    "besides , as the length of the system increases , the profiles become more symmetric .",
    "+   rescaled profiles for systems of increasing size @xmath53 with @xmath54 : the @xmath55 variable is the site index  @xmath49 divided by @xmath0 .",
    "the value of the nongradient force is @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "top : momenta .",
    "bottom : kinetic ( solid lines ) and potential ( dashed lines ) temperatures . , title=\"fig : \" ]   rescaled profiles for systems of increasing size @xmath53 with @xmath54 : the @xmath55 variable is the site index  @xmath49 divided by @xmath0 .",

    "the results presented in figure  [ fig : histograms ] show that the empirical distributions of @xmath58 and  @xmath59 at the site  @xmath61 are in excellent agreement with the gibbs distributions with the same parameters ( average velocity @xmath62 , temperature @xmath50 ) , namely @xmath63 \\ , dp\\ ] ] and @xmath64 \\ , dr,\\ ] ] except for the smallest systems ( say , @xmath65 ) .",

    "bottom : empirical distribution of the distances at bond @xmath60 and comparison with the local gibbs equilibrium with the same average energy .",
    "both plots correspond to a chain of length @xmath66 , with @xmath56 and @xmath57 . ] c.   we check that momenta and distances are independent . to this end , we compare the joint law @xmath67 of @xmath68 and the product law obtained from the tensor product of the individual distributions of these two variables ( denoted respectively by @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) .",

    ", we observe that , for strong mechanical forcings , the current is enhanced when the average temperature decreases , while the opposite happens when the mechanical forcing is small .",
    "we finally turn to the most interesting situation .",

    "the mechanical forcing induces a negative current , while the thermal gradient induces ( in the absence of any force ) a positive current .",
    "the combined effect of both mechanical and thermal forcings induces a negative current _ larger _ ( in absolute value ) than the one in the absence of any thermal gradient !",
    "in conclusion , for large mechanical forcings @xmath2 , we observe that    a.   when @xmath3 is fixed , the current varies qualitatively as when there is no mechanical forcing : the absolute value of the current increases when @xmath1 decreases , which means that the current induced by the thermal forcing and the current induced by the mechanical forcing are somewhat additive . in this case , a positive thermal conductivity is observed ( for a fixed value @xmath2 of the mechanical forcing , considering only the response in the limit when @xmath89 ) . b.   when @xmath1 is fixed , the current has a surprising behavior : its absolute value increases when @xmath3 decreases .",
    "this means that the thermal forcing , which is naively expected to reduce the current induced by the mechanical forcing , actually enhances it . in this case , a negative thermal conductivity is observed ( again , for a fixed value @xmath2 of the mechanical forcing ) .",
    "a possible interpretation is based on the fact that , for such a system , the thermal conductivity is a decreasing function of the temperature when @xmath2 is large ( see figure  [ fig : dtfixed ] ) .",
    "it is possible that , by lowering @xmath3 and thus increasing the conductivity at the right end , one makes the system more sensitive to the mechanical forcing .",
    "the increased mechanical current may hence counterbalance the increased opposite thermal current .",
    "an interesting question which we did not discuss here is the scaling of the energy current as a function of the system size when @xmath90 .",
    "some preliminary results suggest that the thermal conductivity is finite , as when @xmath17 , but this question definitely calls for additional studies ."
