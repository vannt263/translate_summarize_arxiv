    "cepheids are the brightest pulsating variable stars .",
    "they obey tight period  luminosity relations ( plrs ) .",
    "the existence of such a plr was first found approximately a century ago based on photographic observations of 25 cepheids in the small magellanic cloud @xcite . for nearly one hundred years , many researchers have been trying to establish and improve the relationship , mostly using one of three common methods : ( i ) trigonometric parallaxes @xcite , ( ii ) baade  wesselink - type methods or , equivalently , surface - brightness techniques @xcite and ( iii ) main - sequence or isochrone fitting .",
    "the latter method , when applied to single - population star clusters , can be used as independent constraint on the distances , ages and reddening values of cepheids in clusters , which thus enables its use as external calibrator of the plr .",
    "the key to the application of this method resides in selecting high - confidence member stars of the relevant open clusters ( ocs ) .",
    "since @xcite first matched the oc cepheids s nor and u sgr with ngc 6087 and m25 , respectively , and following @xcite , who first established stellar cluster membership based on radial - velocity measurements , many researchers have contributed to this field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "to date , approximately 30 oc cepheids have been found and confirmed .",
    "this number is increasing as the available oc samples are increasing .",
    "a good summary of the way in which calibration of the cepheid plr is performed using the oc and baade  wesselink methods was published by @xcite ; current efforts focus on high - precision membership research pertaining to ocs based on , e.g. , data obtained as part of the vista variables in the va lctea ( vvv ) survey @xcite .",
    "an eight - dimensional search for bona fide cepheids was undertaken by @xcite , based on a careful perusal of the existing literature .",
    "they found five new oc cepheids .    in this paper , our aim is to improve the completeness of the existing body of oc cepheids .",
    "we calculate proper motions using original data rather than literature values for each cluster of interest , with as main aim to find more oc  cepheid associations with similar proper motions .",
    "oc properties are also estimated independently based on colour  magnitude - diagram ( cmd ) analysis and isochrone fitting so as to improve the quality of the ages , reddening values and distances contained in existing oc catalogues .",
    "in contrast to most previous cepheid plr studies , we use near - infrared ( nir ) observations to reduce the impact of extinction , resulting in the determination of a reliable @xmath4-band plr .    in section 2 , we discuss our analysis of the oc and cepheid catalogues used in this study , as well as the five selection criteria applied to find our oc cepheids .",
    "the isochrone - fitting results , as well as crucial reddening checks and our preliminary sample of possible oc cepheids , are covered in section 3 .",
    "we report and discuss the confirmed , new , rejected and uncertain oc cepheids , as well as the issues affecting the completeness of our method , in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "in this section we describe the data and method used to select possible oc cepheids . in general , we select oc cepheid candidates by comparing the cepheids positions with respect to the nearest oc centres and assess the similarity of their proper motions , combined with the cepheids loci in the cluster cmds .",
    "five criteria are used : ( i ) a cepheid must be located within 60 arcmin of an oc s centre ; ( ii ) the cepheid s proper motion must be consistent with the @xmath0 proper - motion distribution of its host oc ; ( iii ) the cepheid lies in the instability strip of its associated oc ; ( iv ) the difference between the cepheid and oc distance moduli ( dms ) @xmath5 mag ; and ( v ) the difference between the cepheid and oc ages , @xmath6 . in sections 2.3 to 2.10",
    ", we outline the details of our method .",
    "this study is partially based on the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* daml02 ; version september 2013 ) oc catalogue .",
    "daml02 contains approximately 2100 clusters , for which it includes entries related to the cluster centre coordinates , size , proper motion and metallicity , if measured . for each cluster",
    ", we compared the centre position with those of the nearby cepheids and obtained a sample of probable oc members . for most ocs",
    ", we used the daml02 oc centre and size to select our initial samples of member stars .",
    "for some clusters characterized by small apparent diameters ( @xmath7 arcmin ) , we used the positions of the bright cepheids , combined with the cluster size , to select stars , provided that the bright cepheids are located close to the cluster centres ( @xmath8 arcmin ) .",
    "these small clusters are not very obvious compared with the field stars , so that our use of the cepheid coordinates as a proxy for the cluster centres allows us to more robustly select possible oc members .",
    "we also used the webda database as reference .",
    "it provides a large amount of information for ocs , including their ages , distances , reddening values and cmds in different passbands .",
    "thus , we obtained the positions of our sample ocs from daml02 .",
    "photometric data pertaining to these ocs were obtained from the homogeneous two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) and the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) .",
    "nir data are more suitable to study ocs in the disc of our milky way galaxy than optical data , because nir observations can be used to limit the effects of differential reddening .",
    "the limiting @xmath4-band magnitude of the 2mass point source catalog @xcite is @xmath9 mag , which is not sufficiently faint for some clusters .",
    "therefore , for faint clusters , where available we added ukidss data to the 2mass data at the faint end .",
    "ukidss performed a northern sky survey of 7500 deg@xmath10 , reaching up to 3 mag fainter than 2mass . specifically , the catalogue we used is the ukidss data release 6 galactic plane survey @xcite .",
    "the cepheid catalogue contains the all sky automated survey ( asas ) catalogue of variable stars , the general catalogue of variable stars ( gcvs ) and the catalogue published by @xcite .",
    "the latter includes 324 cepheids ; it was derived from @xcite and a systematic trend in colour excesses was removed by @xcite .",
    "the @xcite catalogue is a homogeneous database containing @xmath11 photometry in the cape ( cousins ) photometric system for hundreds of galactic cepheids ; the colour excesses , @xmath12 , are from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the @xcite catalogue contains good reddening values and distances , so this catalogue has been used to check the confidence of our reddening values , which we derived independently from isochrone fitting ( see sect .",
    "the asas catalogue of variable stars contains more than one thousand cepheids , some of which are newly found or poorly studied .",
    "although only @xmath13-band data are available for most cepheids in this catalogue , its period information is good and it contains complete light - curve data , which is sufficient to find new oc cepheids .",
    "the gcvs contains approximately 600 cepheids .    from these databases we obtained positions for a list of cepheids to match to nearby ocs .",
    "cepheid distances can be estimated using the cepheid plr from @xcite if the reddening , apparent magnitude and period ( @xmath2 ) are known , giving absolute magnitudes , @xmath14 mag .",
    "we compared the cepheid and oc distances to constrain our sample of possible oc cepheids . to limit the effects of reddening",
    ", we used @xmath15-band data to obtain the mean magnitudes for a subset of the cepheids .",
    "@xmath15-band mean magnitudes in the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) system are available for 229 cepheids @xcite .",
    "we transformed their photometry to that of the 2mass @xmath16 photometric system using the recommended transformation equations .",
    "the differences between the oc nir colour excesses and the cepheids optical colour excesses are small and the prevailing extinction law @xcite is well - understood ; @xmath17 .",
    "these oc nir colour excesses can be adopted to help estimate the cepheid distances .",
    "a position cross - match was done between the oc centres and cepheid positions .",
    "approximately 2100 ocs and more than 1000 cepheids were used .",
    "we adopted a maximum ( projected ) separation of 60 arcmin to select oc  cepheid combinations .",
    "this resulted in 600 possible associations .",
    "the probability of finding genuine oc cepheids at distances in excess of one degree from a given cluster centre is very small or even negligible .",
    "we first concentrated on the roughly one hundred cepheids which are located within 20 arcmin from the nearest cluster centres and performed proper - motion and distance selection for each object individually .",
    "for the cepheids which were located at 2060 arcmin from their associated cluster centres , we first compared the magnitude of the cluster stars and the cepheids in the context of the cluster cmds .",
    "we excluded those cepheids which were fainter than the equivalent cluster stars .",
    "faint cepheids are unlikely oc cepheid candidates , because in a given stellar population cepheids are brighter than the associated main - sequence stars .",
    "combined with position selection , distance selection is a very effective approach to select oc cepheids . if the distance and position of a star are known , its 3d position can be determined . to perform distance selection",
    ", we need to calculate the distances to our sample cepheids and ocs independently . for the cepheids",
    ", we used the best observational plr to calculate their absolute @xmath13-band magnitudes @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13-band mean apparent magnitude is available for all of our cepheids , so if we know the reddening , we can derive the dm for the cepheid of interest .",
    "@xcite provided @xmath12 for some cepheids . for the others , we used the @xmath18 colour excess based on our isochrone fits and converted it to @xmath12 .",
    "although this step may introduce a significant uncertainty ( because the visible reddening affecting the cepheids and ocs may not be the same ) , this will not prevent us from performing a robust distance selection and thus finding possible oc cepheids .",
    "this is so , because across the small oc fields , the differential change in the associated colour excess is much smaller than our distance selection criterion ( see below ) .",
    "oc dms were obtained from isochrone fitting , independent of the distances to the cepheids .",
    "the typical apparent diameter of many ocs is of order 10 arcmin .",
    "however , some very bright oc cepheids can be located at 30 arcmin or more from the cluster centres .",
    "we thus obtained a list of probable oc cepheids , ordered by their projected separation to the corresponding cluster centres . for separations greater than 20 arcmin ,",
    "cepheids that were too faint were removed ( see section 2.3 ) .",
    "if they are fainter than the cluster s main - sequence stars , these objects must be background cepheids .",
    "inspection of finding charts ( using the aladin viewing tool ) and 2mass magnitudes were also used to exclude these bright oc / faint cepheid associations .    because of the relatively bright limiting magnitude and the limited photometric precision of 2mass , the cmds of some 100 ocs do not exhibit tight main sequences , which is particularly an issue for clusters with small numbers of members .",
    "we excluded these clusters from our analysis , since the error in the dm @xmath19 mag .",
    "we imposed @xmath20 mag to compare the dms of our oc ",
    "cepheid combinations and select possible oc cepheids .",
    "the distances to galactic ocs are mostly 5003000 pc , or @xmath2112.5 mag , so that if the difference in dms between a cluster and an apparently associated cepheid is greater than 1.0 mag , the probability that these objects are physically associated with one another is very small indeed . upon completion of this step ,",

    "average radial velocities and their errors for our sample clusters are listed in the daml02 oc calalogue , originally based mostly on the compilations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , radial velocities have only been calculated for fewer than 1000 ocs , and more than half of these radial velocities are based on fewer than three stars .",
    "this clearly leads to large uncertainties in our radial - velocity database .",
    "we have analysed all potential combinations of galactic cepheids and ocs in the most up - to - date catalogues available .",
    "isochrone fitting and proper - motion calculation were done for every potential oc ",
    "cepheid combination .",
    "five selection criteria were used to select possible oc cepheids : ( i ) the cepheid of interest must be located within 60 arcmin of the oc s centre , ( ii ) the cepheid s proper motion is located within the @xmath0 distribution of that of its host oc , ( iii ) the cepheid is located in the instability strip of its postulated host oc , ( iv ) the cepheid and oc dms should differ by less than 1 mag , and ( v ) the cepheid and oc ages should be comparable : @xmath107 .",
    "a comparison of the reddening values derived from our isochrone fits with the reddening values of @xcite shows that our results are reliable .",
    "the nir plr is obtained for a confirmed sample of about 19 oc cepheids , @xmath3 mag , which is in excellent agreement with the best nir plr available for all galactic cepheids @xmath108 from @xcite .",
    "nineteen possible oc cepheids are found based on our nir analysis ; eight additional oc  cepheid associations may be genuine pairs for which we lack nir data .",
    "however , the distance accuracy of our isochrone fits is limited by the data quality , reddening and membership probabilities of the ocs .",
    "six of these cepheids are new , high - probability oc cepheids , since they lie on the nir plr .",
    "these objects include ty sct and cn sct in dolidze 34 , xx sgr in dolidze 52 , ck sct in ngc 6683 , vy car in ascc 61 , and u car in feinstein 1 .",
    "two additional new oc cepheids lack nir data : v0520 cyg in ngc 6991 and cs mon in juchert 18 .",
    "however , many new oc cepheids are still waiting to be found with the availability of better proper - motion data , large samples of radial - velocity data and high - precision and large - area nir data .",
    "in addition , aided by _ gaia _ , trigonometric parallaxes of many galactic cepheids will be obtained in the next few years , and direct calibration of the plr will be possible .",
