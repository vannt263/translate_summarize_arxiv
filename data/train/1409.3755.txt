    "however , the interplay of quantum work and quantum statistical properties , e.g. , the fermi - dirac statistics or the bose - einstein statistics have not been fully explored yet ( but see refs .",
    "interference @xcite of identical particles will undoubtedly influence the thermodynamic properties of many - particle systems .",
    "the difference between the bose - einstein distribution and the fermi - dirac distribution for identical particles in single - particle eigenstates can be interpreted as a manifestation of the",

    "the difference of the work distribution functions between bosons and fermions for three particles are more prominent than those for two particles .",
    "it can be inferred that , with the increase of the particle number , the distinguishability of the work distributions of bosons and fermions at low temperature will becomes even more significant .",
    "this can be understood by considering that , at low temperature , the system will stay in a state close to the many - particle ground state . for bosons and fermions",
    "the ground states are a bose condensate and a fermi sea , respectively .    by further increasing the particle number ,",
    "the complexity of the calculation of the transition probabilities between many - particle eigenstates increases exponentially with the particle number .",

    "however , from the work distribution functions for three particles at @xmath72 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : piston_3_slow]-[fig : piston_3_fast ] ) , one already observes the tendency to converge by raising the temperature .      as a second case study of pedagogical value we analyze the 1d harmonic oscillator . specifically , we consider the hamiltonian @xmath73 where @xmath62 is again the single particle mass and we identify the work parameter with the angular frequency , @xmath74 .",

    "[ fig : harm_2_slow]-[fig : harm_3_fast ] we plot the cumulative work distribution for the linear quench , @xmath87 generally , the same features as those in the case of the 1d piston system can be observed : in the limit of low temperature , the work distribution functions for bosons and for fermions differ significantly , while for high temperatures the three distributions converge . also , one may notice that in the 1d piston system the cumulative work has contributions in both negative and positive values ( see e.g. figs .",
    "[ fig : piston_2_intermediate]-[fig : piston_2_fast ] ) . the negative ( positive )",
    "value of work corresponds to the  trajectory \" of jumping from a higher ( lower ) energy state to a lower ( higher ) energy state . in the harmonic oscillator",
    ", we also see that the cumulative work has a tiny tail for the negative values ( see third line of fig .",
    "[ fig : harm_2_fast ] ) , but it is much less prominent than those in the piston system .",

    "an interesting feature to note is that the interference seems to play much less of a role for the harmonic oscillator than for the piston . in particular",
    ", the work distributions for bosons , fermion , and distinguishable particles start converging at much lower temperatures .",
    "this can be understood by noticing that the energy levels of the harmonic oscillator are much denser than the ones of the square well potential .",
    "thus , interference effects are `` smeared out '' already at finite but low temperatures .",
    "at low temperatures the thermal distributions for bosons and for fermions significantly differ .",
    "this is due to `` static interference '' expressed by the fact that the many - particle eigenstates can be expressed in terms of a determinant ( for fermions ) and a permanent ( for bosons ) in the second quantization formalism @xcite .",
    "note that the pauli exclusion principle states that two identical fermions can not occupy the same single - particle state , while for bosons there is no such a constraint . at high temperatures , however ,",
    "the thermal states for bosons and for fermions become indistinguishable , which can be interpreted as a consequence of the static  correspondence principle \" in quantum statistical sense for @xmath1 .    as we discussed in sec .",

    "thus , we have demonstrated that , in the high temperature limit , the characteristic function of work distribution functions for both bosons and fermions converge towards that of distinguishable particles , and hence to each other . since there is a one - to - one map between the work distribution and its corresponding characteristic function @xcite",
    ", we conclude that in the high temperature limit , the work distributions for bosons and fermions converge .",
    "this conclusion can be understood intuitively : firstly , in the limit of high temperatures , for most of the many - particle eigenstates , usually a single - particle state is occupied by at most one particle , and the occupations of bosons , fermions and distinguishable particles in the single - particle states become similar .",
    "accordingly , the distributions of the multi - particle eigenenergies ( [ probability ] ) for three kinds of particles become similar .",
    "this is the so - called ",
    "static \" correspondence principle in the quantum statistical sense .",
    "secondly , for a given finite - speed work protocol , if the average velocity of the particles in a high - lying multi - particle eigenstate is much higher than the speed of varying the parameter , the process can be roughly regarded as a  quasistatic \" process . in the thermal state of infinite temperature ,",
    "all energy eigenstates have equal probability .",
    "that means for a given finite - speed protocol , for most of the initial eigenstates ( sampled from the thermal state at the infinite temperature ) , the processes can be regarded as quasistatic processes .",
    "thirdly , if the dynamic process is a quasistatic process , the work value usually can be assumed to be proportional to the initial eigenenergy ( at least it is true for the 1d piston and the 1d harmonic oscillator ( [ proportionality ] ) ) , and thus the work distributions will share the same properties as the distributions of the multi - particle eigenenergies ( [ probability ] ) .",
    "based on these observations , one can infer that for an arbitrary finite - speed protocol and in the limit of infinite temperature the work distribution functions for three kinds of particles converge .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that this result does not depend on the specifics of the model , and , hence , holds for any system of many noninteracting , identical particles .",
    "in this paper we have studied the effect of indistinguishability ( quantum interference of identical , noninteracting particles ) on the quantum work distribution .",
    "we have found that the work distribution can be computed from the time evolution matrix for single particles .",
    "then , the transition amplitudes between multi - particle states are given by the slater - determinant ( for fermions ) or the permanent ( for bosons ) .",
    "generally , the computation of the permanent of a matrix is much more involved than the computation of the determinant  despite the apparent similarity of the definitions @xcite : in particular , the determinant obeys several algebraic rules and symmetries , e.g. , the product rule @xmath113 and the invariance under unitary transformation , which allow the determinant to be evaluated in polynomial time . for a @xmath114 matrix ,",
    "e.g. , the elementary gaussian algorithm needs @xmath115 operations @xcite . although the permanent has a similar structure the omission of the alternating sign makes all the difference , and all known strategies for an efficient evaluation of the determinant fail for the permanent . in general , a permanent can only be computed in exponential time , even when applying ryser s algorithm @xcite  the most efficient algorithm known to date .",
    "therefore , the development of both exact and approximate algorithms for computing the permanent of a matrix is an active area of research .    for our problem",
    "this means that the computation of the work density for fermions is much more feasible than for bosons .",
    "the exponential increase of the complexity of computing the permanent limits the study of the work distribution to at most 25 bosons @xcite .",
    "this restriction might be lifted by a novel development in the field of quantum information known as boson sampling  a shortcut to quantum computing @xcite . in this technique",
    "the bosonic distribution is obtained from interfering photons in a random optical network . however , practical applications of boson sampling are still under active research @xcite .",
    "our expression for the characteristic function ( [ derivation ] ) is valid for both quasistatic and nonquasistatic processes . to the best of our knowledge ,",

    "specifically , if the system is a particle in a 1d piston , the quasistatic work distribution becomes @xmath122 for @xmath3 distinguishable particles , the work distribution function can be obtained by replacing the @xmath123 with @xmath124 and due to the additivity of the gamma distribution we obtain @xmath125 the latter result coincides with the expression for quasistatically compressing ( or expanding ) @xmath3-particle gas inside a piston , which was previously derived in ref .",
