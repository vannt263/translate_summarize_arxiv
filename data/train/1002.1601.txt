    "realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potentials reproduce the experimental nn scattering data up to energies of @xmath3 mev with a @xmath4 per datum close to 1 .",
    "however , the use of these potentials in the description of the three- and four - nucleon bound and scattering states gives a @xmath4 per datum much larger than 1 ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in order to improve that situation , different three - nucleon force ( tnf )",
    "models have been introduced so far .",
    "widely used in the literature are the tucson - melbourne ( tm ) and the urbana ix ( urix ) models @xcite .",
    "these models are based on the exchange mechanism of two pions between three nucleons .",
    "the tm model has been revisited within a chiral symmetry approach  @xcite , and it has been demonstrated that the contact term present in it should be dropped .",
    "this new tm potential , known as tm , has been subsequently readjusted  @xcite .",
    "the final operatorial structure coincides with that one given in the tnf of brazil already derived many years ago  @xcite .",
    "tnf models based on @xmath5 and @xmath6 meson exchange mechanisms have also been derived  @xcite and their effects have been studied in the triton binding energy  @xcite .",
    "more recently , tnfs have been derived  @xcite using a chiral effective field theory at next - to - next - to - leading order . a local version of these interactions ( hereafter referred as n2lol ) can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . at this particular order ,",
    "the tnf has two unknown constants that have to be determined .",
    "more in general , all the models contain a certain number of parameters that fix the strength of the different terms that compose the interaction .",
    "it is a common practice to determine these parameters from the three- and four - nucleon binding energies . in the chiral effective field theory",
    "there is a consistent derivation of the two- and three - nucleon interactions and some of the low energy constants entering in the tnf are fixed already from the nn data . on the other hand ,",
    "the parametrization of the tm and urix interactions have been determined in association with specific nn potentials .",
    "therefore , their parametrizations could change when used with different nn potentials since different nn potentials predict different @xmath0 binding energies .    the @xmath1 doublet scattering length @xmath7 can give valuable information . in principle",
    "this quantity is correlated , to some extent , to the @xmath8 binding energy through the so - called phillips line  @xcite .",
    "however the presence of tnfs of the type studied here breaks this correlation .",
    "therefore @xmath7 emerges as an independent observable that can be used to evaluate the capability of the interaction models to describe the low energy region . due to the lack of excited states in the @xmath8 system ,",
    "the zero energy state is the first one above the ground state . in the case of @xmath1 scattering at zero energy , the @xmath9 state is orthogonal to the triton ground state and , for this reason , the wave function presents a node in the relative distance between the incident nucleon and the deuteron .",
    "the position of the node is related to the scattering length and it is also sensitive to the relation between the overall attraction and repulsion of the interaction .",
    "several of the realistic nn potentials underestimate the triton binding energy . adding a tnf , which in general can include an attractive as well as a repulsive component , with a strength fixed for example to reproduce the triton binding energy , the balance between the overall attraction and repulsion of the interaction changes with respect to that one produced by the nn potential alone . and ,",
    "as we will show , this leads to different predictions of @xmath7 and the @xmath10-particle binding energy @xmath11(@xmath12he ) .",
    "an analysis of the parametrization of a chiral tnf , in order to describe the triton binding energy @xmath11(@xmath13h ) , @xmath11(@xmath12he ) and @xmath7 , has been performed in ref .",
    "a similar analysis has not been done for the local models urix , tm and n2lol since only the three- or four - body binding energy has been considered in the determination of their parametrization but not @xmath7 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite results for different combinations of nn interactions plus tnf models are given .",
    "we report the results for the quantities of interest in table i. from the table , we can observe that the models are not able to describe simultaneously the @xmath0 binding energies and @xmath7 .",
    "triggered by this fact , in this paper we make a comparative study of the aforementioned tnf models . to this end",
    "we use the av18  @xcite as the reference nn interaction and the three - nucleon interaction models will be added to it .",
    "parametrizations of the urix and tm models already exist in conjunction with the av18 potential .",
    "conversely the n2lol tnf has been constructed using the n3lo - idaho potential from ref .",
    "so , in a first step , we have adapted its parametrization in order to reproduce , in conjunction with the av18 interaction , @xmath11(@xmath13h ) .",
    "successively , we study the sensitivity of different parametrizations in the description of @xmath11(@xmath12he ) and @xmath7 . selecting those parametrizations that predict these three quantities close to their experimental values , we study some polarization observables in @xmath14 scattering at @xmath15 mev . as an interesting result",
    ", we have observed that the predictions of the different parametrizations fall in a narrow band that , in the case of the vector analyzing powers , has a different position for each model , indicating a sensitivity to the short range structure of the tnf .",

    "similar analyses using slightly different values of the cutoff @xmath34 around @xmath149 mev do not change these results .    in order to correctly describe @xmath11(@xmath12he ) , after fixing @xmath11(@xmath13h ) and @xmath7 , we now analyze a modification to the relative strength of the @xmath21- and @xmath22-terms which , in the previous analysis , was maintained at its original value of @xmath150 . to this end",
    "we perform a similar study as has been done previously for the other tnf models . fixing the constant @xmath135 to its original value @xmath139 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath100",

    "at each point of the curves in the left panels and at the points in the right panels , @xmath137 has been chosen to reproduce the triton binding energy . due to the @xmath152 operator in the @xmath53-term of the n2lol potential , positive values of @xmath100",
    "makes this term attractive .",
    "conversely , negative values of @xmath100 makes this term repulsive .",
    "we have considered only one positive case , @xmath153 .",
    "increasing further @xmath100 we found it difficult to describe correctly @xmath11(@xmath12he ) . for negatives values of @xmath100",

    "[ tb : n2loe ] we report the mean values of the kinetic energy , the two - nucleon potential energy as well as the mean values of the attractive part of the tnf , @xmath117 , and its repulsive part @xmath118 for the selected values of the parameters that correspond to the best description of the three quantities under study . in the last two columns of the table , @xmath11(@xmath12he ) and @xmath7 are given .",
    "the contributions to @xmath117 come from the @xmath18- , @xmath21- , @xmath22 and @xmath52-terms , which are always attractive in the cases considered , and from the @xmath53-term in the first case .",
    "this term contributes to the repulsive part @xmath118 in the last two cases . from the table",
    "we may observe that @xmath136 and @xmath137 results to be larger and smaller than their original values , respectively .",
    "this is a consequence of the simultaneous description of @xmath11(@xmath13h ) and @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , in the first three cases , the ratio @xmath160 , is much smaller than the original ratio .",
    "in the previous section we have studied different parametrizations of the tm , urix and n2lol tnf models in conjunction with the av18 nn potential .",
    "the analysis has been done varying the parameters in order first to reproduce @xmath11(@xmath13h ) and then looking at their dependence on @xmath7 and @xmath102 . to improve the description of these quantities ,",
    "some substantial modifications were necessary for the first two models . in the case of the tm interaction we found opportune the inclusion of a repulsive term . in the analysis of the urix interaction ,",
    "the strength of the repulsive term resulted to be more than three times bigger than the original value and the relative strength of the @xmath21- and @xmath22-terms , originally fixed to @xmath161 , has been also increased . in the case of the n2lol interaction ,",
    "some adjustment of the parameters was necessary , mainly due to the fact that the av18 interaction is less attractive than the n3lo interaction , from which the n2lol model has been originally parametrized . in this section",
    "we analyze the effects of the new parametrizations in observables that are not correlated to the binding energies or to @xmath7 .",
    "some polarization observables in @xmath14 scattering have this characteristic , in particular the vector and tensor analyzing powers . in figs .",
    "[ fig : tucobs ] ,  [ fig : urbobs ] ,  [ fig : n2lobs ] we show the differential cross section @xmath162 , the vector polarization observables @xmath163 and @xmath164 and the tensor polarization observables @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 at @xmath15 mev for the different potential models compared to the results obtained using the original av18+urix interaction . in the figures , the cyan band collects the results obtained with the parameters given in the three last rows of table  [ tb : tme ] , from the second to the sith row of table  [ tb : urbe ] , and the three last rows of table  [ tb : n2loe ] for each model respectively , whereas the solid line is the prediction of the original av18+urix model . as we can see , for each tnf model , the observables calculated using the different parametrizations , fixed from a simultaneous description of @xmath105 , @xmath7 and @xmath102 , fall in bands which , in the case of the vector analyzing powers , have a different position for the three models . since the models essentially differ in the definitions of the functions @xmath26 , @xmath89 and @xmath58 , this difference can be associated to the different short - range behavior of the tnf models . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tucobs ] we observe that the av18+tm model , using the new parametrizations , does not give any improvement in the observables compared to the av18+urix predictions .",
    "moreover @xmath164 and @xmath166 are worse described .",
    "it should be observed that the av18+tm model , with the original parametrization , and the av18+urix give similar results for the observables ( a small difference can be observed in the maximum of @xmath163 being slightly higher for the former ) .",
    "therefore the previous conclusions do not change if compared to the original av18+tm model . in fig .",
    "[ fig : urbobs ] we observe that the new parametrizations of the av18+urix produce a much worse description of @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath166 .",
    "since the vector analyzing powers are mainly described by the @xmath23-wave phase - shift and mixing parameters , we can conclude that they result to be poorly reproduced with the new parametrizations .",
    "conversely to what happened analyzing the previous models , in fig .",
    "[ fig : n2lobs ] , we observe that the n2lol interaction produces an improvement in the description of @xmath163 and @xmath164 . the well known discrepancy in these observables is now reduced and , in particular for @xmath163 , the improvement is noticeable . in the case of the tensor analyzing powers , a slightly worse description of @xmath166 between the two maxima is now observed .",
    "in general all tnfs of the type analyzed here have this effect in @xmath166 indicating that a different mechanism , not present in the models , should be considered to improve the description of the minimum around @xmath168 .",
    "finally we would like to comment on the fact that the vector analyzing powers , @xmath163 and @xmath164 , calculated using different tnf models fall inside a band with a different position for each model . in fig .  [",
    "fig : ayfig ] the three bands , extracted from figs .  [ fig : tucobs],[fig : urbobs],[fig : n2lobs ] , are shown explicitly and compared to original av18+urix model ( solid line ) .",
    "we can clearly observe the different position of the bands with the best description obtained with the new parametrizations of the av18+n2lo model and the worst description with those one of the av18+urix model .",
    "since all the models inside the bands describe reasonably well @xmath11(@xmath13h ) , @xmath7 and @xmath102 , we can conclude that the difference is a direct consequence of their different short range structure .",
    "a natural question is whether , with opportune modifications of their radial dependence , i.e. modifying the functions @xmath26 , @xmath89 and @xmath58 , it will be possible to improve further the description of these observables at @xmath15 mev and , eventually , obtain a @xmath4 per datum close to one . a preliminary study in this direction has shown that a further improvement in the @xmath163 and @xmath164 maxima is associated to a worse description of the @xmath166 minimum .",
    "the particular structure of these observables is related to a bigger splitting in the @xmath169 phase - shifts than the normal splitting produced by the two - nucleon forces , as discussed in ref .",
    "in particular the @xmath170 phase - shift has to be smaller and the mixing parameter @xmath171 has to be bigger .",
    "it is a general feature of the tnfs studied here that they tend to increase both , @xmath170 and @xmath171 . to be more precise , in table  [ tb : phases ]",
    "we show the @xmath172 phase - shifts and @xmath171 for the av18 and av18+urix potential models , and for one selected set of the parameters of tables  [ tb : tme ] ,  [ tb : urbe ] ,  [ tb : n2loe ] corresponding to the new parametrizations of the av18+tm , av18+urix and av18+n2lol models ( indicated in the table with an asterisk ) .",
    "in particular , parametrizations of the second row of table  [ tb : tme ] , fourth row of table  [ tb : urbe ] and third row of table  [ tb : n2loe ] have been used , respectively . in the last row of the table , the results from phase - shift analysis ( psa ) of ref .",
    "@xcite are given . from the table",
    "we observe that the @xmath170 phase - shift increases when the tnf models are added to the av18 potential . by itself",
    "this change will produce a much worse description of @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "however this is well compensated with the corresponding increase in @xmath173 and @xmath171 .",
    "this is not the case with the minimum in @xmath166 , for which a better description would be obtained lowering the av18 value of @xmath170 , as discussed in ref .",
    "the other parametrizations given in tables  [ tb : tme ] ,  [ tb : urbe ] ,  [ tb : n2loe ] produce similar changes in the @xmath169 parameters . from this observation",
    "we can conclude that the spin - isospin structure of the tnfs considered here is not sufficient to describe simultaneously @xmath11(@xmath13h ) , @xmath7 , @xmath102 and the vector and tensor analyzing powers at low energies .",
    "stimulated by the fact that some of the widely used tnf models do not reproduce simultaneously the triton and the @xmath12he binding energies and the @xmath1 doublet scattering length , we have analyzed possible modifications to their parametrizations . to this end we have selected the av18 as the reference two - nucleon force and , associated with it , we have varied the original parameters of the tm and urix models so as to improve the description of the three quantities mentioned . furthermore , using the recent local form of a chiral tnf ( we have called this model n2lol ) , we have studied its parametrization associated to the av18 interaction too .",
    "the analysis has proceeded in the following way .",
    "the three models under observation , tm , av18 and n2lol , have been written in configuration space as a sum of five terms , the @xmath18- , @xmath21- , @xmath22- , @xmath174- and @xmath53-terms .",
    "the first three , corresponding to a two - pion exchange process , are attractive .",
    "the last two , corresponding to contact terms , can be either attractive or repulsive .",
    "not all the models include the five terms . in the tm model only the @xmath18- , @xmath21- and @xmath22-terms are present and therefore , this model does not include explicitly a repulsive term .",
    "the urix model includes the @xmath21- , @xmath22- and @xmath53-terms .",
    "this last term has been parametrized as repulsive in order to compensate the large overbinding produced by the first two terms in infinite nuclear matter .",
    "the n2lol model includes the five terms .",
    "the study has been started analyzing the av18+tm model . maintaining fixed the strength of the @xmath18-term at its original value ,",
    "we have varied the strengths of the @xmath21- and @xmath22-terms for several values of the cutoff parameter @xmath34 .",
    "we have explored negative values of the strength parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 in order to keep the attractive character of these terms .",
    "we have found it difficult to reproduce @xmath7 for reasonable values of the strength parameters .",
    "this fact has motivated the subsequent step of introducing a repulsive term in the model . as a simple choice ,",
    "we have introduced a purely central @xmath53-term and a corresponding @xmath58 function , obtained using the monopole cutoff of the model . including this term we were able to describe simultaneously @xmath11(@xmath13h ) and @xmath7 for several values of the cutoff .",
    "a further selection among these values has been done from the calculation of @xmath11(@xmath12he ) .",
    "we have observed that with @xmath175 it was possible to describe the three quantities reasonably well .    in the original av18+urix model the relative strength between the @xmath21- and @xmath22-terms",
    "was fixed . in the present analysis we have relaxed this condition increasing the number of parameter of the model from two to three , the strengths of the @xmath21- , @xmath22- and @xmath53-terms .",
    "varying them , we have found it possible to describe the three quantities of interest for values of the parameters very different from their original ones .",
    "in particular , the strength of the repulsive term resulted more than three times larger than the original value . in the case of the av18+n2lol model ,",
    "maintaining the strength of the @xmath18-term fixed to its original value , we have varied the parameters @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath100 in combinations that reproduce @xmath11(@xmath13h ) .",
    "then we have studied the dependence on @xmath7 and @xmath11(@xmath12he ) of the different parametrizations . for fixed values of @xmath100",
    "we have calculated @xmath7 for different values of @xmath136 and @xmath138 .",
    "we have found that @xmath176 in order to describe simultaneously @xmath11(@xmath13h ) and @xmath7 .",
    "the values of @xmath138 has been selected from the analysis of @xmath11(@xmath12he ) .",
    "values of @xmath11(@xmath12he ) compatible with the experimental value have been found in the four cases of @xmath100 explored .    after making this sensitivity study",
    "we have selected , for each model , some combinations of the parameters that give the better description of @xmath11(@xmath13h ) , @xmath7 and @xmath11(@xmath12he ) and we have calculated the differential cross section and the vector and tensor analyzing powers at @xmath15 mev . at this energy",
    "there are well established discrepancies between the predictions of the theoretical models and the experimental results .",
    "for example all potential models underestimate @xmath163 ( the so - called @xmath163 puzzle ) and @xmath164 and overestimate the central minimum in @xmath166 .",
    "some tnf models have been constructed _ ad hoc _ to improve the description of these observables at low energy  @xcite .",
    "however the models studied here , derived from the exchange of two pions and contact terms , are not able to solve these discrepancies .",
    "what we have observed in the present study is that after fixing the parameters of each model from the description of @xmath11(@xmath13h ) , @xmath7 and @xmath11(@xmath12he ) , the description of the vector polarization observables lies in a narrow band , positioned differently for each model .",
    "the best description is given by the av18+n2lol model which , with respect to the original av18+urix model , reduces appreciably the discrepancy in @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "however it gives a slightly worse description of the central minimum of @xmath166 .",
    "the other two models do not improve the description of the observables , compared always to the original av18+urix .",
    "the modified tm model gives similar results though @xmath164 is slightly worse whereas the results with the modified urix model are definitely worse than the original model .",
    "the fact that for each model the @xmath163 and @xmath164 predictions lie in a narrow band , indicates a connection between the short - range structure of the tnf and the polarization observables at low energies . from the analysis",
    "we can conclude that the smoother form of the @xmath26 , @xmath89 and @xmath58 functions of the n2lol potential are preferable . to be noticed that the tm and urix models do not include a @xmath52-term .",
    "an extended analysis of these two models including it , will allow for a more stringent conclusion about the short - range structure of the tnf models .",
    "preliminary studies in this direction are underway .    finally , at the end of sec .",
    "iii , we have analyzed the @xmath169 phase - shift parameters .",
    "the overall attractive character of the tnf makes larger the @xmath170 and @xmath173 parameters , compared to the ones obtained using a nn force alone , and has little effect on @xmath173 .",
    "the mixing parameter @xmath171 is larger too .",
    "depending on the relative increase of these parameters , the description of @xmath163 and @xmath164 can improve , as in the case of the n2lol model , but not the description of the central minimum of @xmath166 .",
    "the spin - isospin structure of the tnf models studied here can not lower the @xmath170 phase - shift which seems to be necessary in order to improve the description of @xmath166 in the minimum .",
    "a different mechanism has to be included in the structure of the tnf , as for example it has been proposed in ref .",
    "studies along this line are at present underway .",
