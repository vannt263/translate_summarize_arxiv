    "<S> in this paper , we introduce a freeze - out scheme for the dynamical models near the qcd critical point through coupling the decoupled classical particles with the order parameter field . with a modified distribution function that satisfies specific static fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the correlated fluctuations of net protons on the hydrodynamic freeze - out surface . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with recent star data shows that our model calculations could roughly reproduce energy dependent cumulant @xmath0 and @xmath1 of net protons through tuning the related parameters . </S>",
    "<S> however , the calculated @xmath2 and @xmath3 with both poisson and binomial baselines are always above the experimental data due to the positive contributions from the static critical fluctuations . in order to qualitatively and quantitatively describe all the related experimental data , the dynamical critical fluctuations and more realistic non - critical fluctuation baselines </S>",
    "<S> should be investigated in the near future . </S>"
