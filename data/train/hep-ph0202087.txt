    "<S> _ contribution to the snowmass 2001 workshop on `` the future of particle physics '' , snowmass , co , usa , july 2001 _    a general two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) or more complicated extension of the one - doublet higgs sector of the standard model ( sm ) remains an attractive possibility  @xcite , especially as an effective theory in the context of models with new physics at an energy scale significantly below the usual gut scale . </S>",
    "<S> although gauge coupling unification is not necessarily relevant in such theories , it can be achieved @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for two doublets and one @xmath5 triplet , the gauge couplings unify at @xmath6 ; increasingly complicated higgs sectors are required for gauge coupling unification at still lower scales . </S>",
    "<S> ( the unification at low scales can not be true gauge group unification without encountering problems with proton decay . however , there are examples of theories ( for example , many string theories ) in which the couplings are predicted to unify without the presence of a larger gauge group . ) </S>",
    "<S> if there is a neutral member of a triplet representation , @xmath7 remains natural provided it has zero vev @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> current data provide some important hints and constraints regarding the higgs sector @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as is well known , the simplest interpretation of the precision electroweak data is the existence of a rather light sm - like higgs boson ( the mass corresponding to the smallest @xmath8 being @xmath9 , well below the lep experimental lower limit of 114.1 gev ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , alternative fits to the precision electroweak data without a light sm - like higgs boson are possible when an extended higgs sector is present . </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on the cp - conserving ( cpc ) 2hdm with its five physical higgs bosons , @xmath10 .     </S>",
    "<S> the outer ellipses show the 90% cl region from current precision electroweak data in the @xmath11 plane for @xmath12 relative to a central point defined by the sm prediction with @xmath13 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the blobs of points show the @xmath11 predictions for 2hdm models with a light @xmath0 and with @xmath14 such that the @xmath0 can not be detected in @xmath15 or @xmath16 production at either the lc or the lhc ; the mass of the sm - like @xmath17 is set equal to @xmath18 ( left ) or @xmath19 ( right ) and @xmath20 and @xmath21 have been chosen to minimize the @xmath8 of the full precision electroweak fit . </S>",
    "<S> the innermost ( middle ) ellipse shows the 90% ( 99.9% ) cl region for @xmath13 gev after giga-@xmath22 lc operation _ and _ a @xmath23 mev threshold scan measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the stars to the bottom right show the @xmath11 predictions in the case of the sm with @xmath24 ( left ) or @xmath19 ( right ) . </S>",
    "<S> this figure is from @xcite.,width=453 ]    the scenario we wish to consider is that in which the @xmath0 of the 2hdm is light and all other higgs bosons are heavy . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that this type of scenario can be consistent with precision electroweak constraints  @xcite . if @xmath25 is small , the best fit to the precision electroweak data is achieved by choosing the lighter cp - even higgs boson , @xmath17 , to be sm - like . </S>",
    "<S> a good fit is achieved even for @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> of course , such a heavy sm - like @xmath17 leads to large @xmath27 and large @xmath28 contributions , which on their own would place the @xmath11 prediction of the 2hdm model well outside the current 90% cl ellipse  see the stars in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ellipse ] ( from @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the large @xmath28 contribution from the sm - like @xmath17 can be compensated by a large @xmath29 from a small mass non - degeneracy ( weak isospin breaking ) of the still heavier @xmath30 and @xmath31 higgs bosons . in detail , for a light @xmath0 and sm - like @xmath17 one finds = \\ { -3m_w^2}[drhonew ] </S>",
    "<S> from which we see that the first term can easily compensate the large negative contribution to @xmath32 from the @xmath33 term . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ellipse ] , the blobs correspond to 2hdm parameter choices for which : ( a ) @xmath34 of a linear @xmath35 collider ( lc ) (  @xmath36 is such that the @xmath17 can not be observed at the lc ) ; ( b ) @xmath37 has been chosen ( with both @xmath38 ) so that the @xmath11 prediction is well within the 90% cl ellipse of the current precision electroweak fits ; and ( c ) @xmath25 and @xmath14 are in the ` wedge ' of @xmath1 $ ] parameter space for which detection of the @xmath0 via @xmath16 and @xmath15 production at the lhc and lc would be difficult @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( this wedge will be discussed in more detail below . for @xmath39 and @xmath40 at the lc , @xmath25 values as low as roughly @xmath41 could still fall into this wedge for @xmath42 . ) </S>",
    "<S> however , this scenario can only be pushed so far . in order to maintain perturbativity for all the higgs self couplings , </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary that the @xmath17 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 masses not be greatly in excess of @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies , in particular , that the sm - like @xmath17 would be detected at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> if it should happen that a heavy sm - like higgs boson is detected at the lhc , the precision electroweak situation could only be resolved by giga-@xmath22 operation and a @xmath44 @xmath45 threshold scan at the lc ( with the resulting ellipse sizes illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ellipse ] ) . the resulting determination of @xmath11 would be sufficiently precise to definitively check for values like those of the blobs of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ellipse ] . if no other new physics was detected at the lc or lhc that could cause the extra @xmath29 , searching for the other higgs bosons of a possible 2hdm higgs sector , especially a possibly light decoupled @xmath0 , would become a high priority .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , a light @xmath0 with @xmath46 would yield a positive contribution to the muon s anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath47 , coming mainly from the two - loop bar - zee graph @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent data @xcite suggests the presence of just such a deviation from sm expectations . </S>",
    "<S> however , after including the recent corrections to the sign of the light - by - light scattering contribution and allowing for uncertainty in @xmath48 , the discrepancy between the experimental result and the sm prediction is not large , and may not be present at all . </S>",
    "<S> the best that can be said is that a small positive discrepancy in @xmath47 can be explained by the presence of an @xmath0 for moderate values of @xmath25 and @xmath14 in the ` wedge ' region for which direct discovery of the @xmath0 would be difficult at the lc and lhc using the standard modes we describe later .    to summarize , it is not unreasonable to suppose that the higgs sector contains a 2hdm with a light @xmath0 , a heavy sm - like @xmath17 , and still heavier @xmath30 and @xmath31 with a small mass splitting . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath17 would be detected at the lhc , but we would have no understanding of how this is to be made consistent with precision electroweak constraints . </S>",
    "<S> direct detection of the @xmath0 would become a priority . in the remainder of this note </S>",
    "<S> , we wish to consider the various means for detecting a light @xmath0 at a linear collider .    </S>",

    "<S> at least one of the @xmath59 yukawa couplings of the @xmath0 must be substantial : relative to sm - like strength , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath65 coupling derives from fermion loops , and , as noted , not both the @xmath15 and @xmath66 coupling can be suppressed .    turning first to @xmath16 and @xmath15 production , the former ( latter ) always </S>",
    "<S> yields significant rates if @xmath14 is small ( large ) enough ( and the process is kinematically allowed ) . </S>",
    "<S> but , even for high @xmath2 and large luminosity , there remains a wedge of moderate @xmath14 for which neither process provides adequate event rate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the wedge corresponding to fewer than 20 events in either process for @xmath40 at @xmath67 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ wedge ] . </S>",
    "<S> ( probably backgrounds would imply that more than 20 events would be needed to see the signal , so this wedge is a conservative indication of the region in which these processes would not be visible . ) </S>",
    "<S> the extent of the corresponding wedge at the lhc can be estimated from the cms and atlas @xcite @xmath1 $ ] discovery region plots for the mssm higgs sector as follows . at high @xmath14 , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath68 and @xmath15 processes make roughly equal contributions to the @xmath69 final state signal . </S>",
    "<S> since the rates are proportional to @xmath70 , the location of the upper limit of the lhc wedge simply needs to be rescaled by a factor of @xmath71 , implying the lhc could find a @xmath0 signal for @xmath72 at @xmath73 ( comparable to the lc result ) rising to @xmath74 at @xmath75 ( which is significantly better coverage than the lc ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , at low @xmath14 , the only mssm channel for @xmath0 discovery at the lhc deemed viable to date employs @xmath76 decays which would be absent in the type of model being considered here in which only the @xmath0 is light .    for the lower values of @xmath25 , double higgs production via the quartic couplings will allow discovery at the lc even in the wedge region . </S>",
    "<S> the cross sections for @xmath77 and @xmath78 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ aaz_nnaa_fig ] . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the process @xmath77 yields 20 events for @xmath40 for @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) for @xmath18 ( @xmath67 ) , while @xmath81 fusion production yields 20 events for @xmath79 ( @xmath82 ) , respectively . a careful assessment of backgrounds is required to ascertain just what the mass reach of these processes actually is .    </S>",
    "<S> if the @xmath83 collider option is implemented at the lc , @xmath58 will provide a signal for a decoupled @xmath0 over a significant portion of the wedge region . </S>",
    "<S> the results from the quite realistic study of @xcite are illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ wedge ] , which focuses on @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> the pluses indicate @xmath85 discovery points after 3 years of appropriate running at the nlc . </S>",
    "<S> the higher tesla luminosity for @xmath83 collisions would allow @xmath85 discovery for the additional points indicated by the circles .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , although we do nt present details here , a muon collider capable of operating at @xmath18 and below would probably be able to provide @xmath85 signals for the @xmath0 in the @xmath86 wedge region after about 3 years of appropriately configured operation , assuming the current nominal higgs factory luminosities . for more details , see @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the above results indicate the need for exploring additional mechanisms by which a @xmath0 with @xmath84 might be produced and detected . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining possibilities are the one - loop processes : @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> the first two have previously been explored in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> results for the third process will be given for the first time here ; details of the computation will appear in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results we shall present for @xmath90 agree ( where comparison is possible ) with the 2hdm results of @xcite , but not with those of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results for @xmath88 do not agree except in a very rough way with the 2hdm results of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( the @xmath88 process was not computed in @xcite . ) in all our loop computations , we have employed the running @xmath91-quark mass as a function of @xmath25 in evaluating the @xmath15 coupling employed in computing the @xmath91-quark loop contribution to the one - loop couplings . </S>",
    "<S> our results are obtained by including only the fermion @xmath92 loop contributions ; in particular , we assume that all other higgs bosons are sufficiently heavy that loop diagrams containing them will be small .     </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath90 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 cross sections as a function of @xmath25 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , for @xmath95.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]   the @xmath90 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 cross sections as a function of @xmath25 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , for @xmath95.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]   the @xmath90 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 cross sections as a function of @xmath25 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , for @xmath95.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]    our results for @xmath87 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 appear in the three windows of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ loopha ] . from these figures </S>",
    "<S> , it should be immediately clear that the only process that might yield a useful event rate is @xmath90 , and then only if @xmath14 is not large . for @xmath90 </S>",
    "<S> , roughly 80 declining to 30 events are predicted for @xmath96 and @xmath97 increasing to @xmath98 , assuming @xmath18 and @xmath40 . at @xmath99 , only 3 declining to 1 events </S>",
    "<S> are anticipated for the same @xmath25 mass range . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , there will be substantial background . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the search will take place in the @xmath100 final state , the irreducible background will come from @xmath101 production . </S>",
    "<S> this was evaluated in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the result found is @xmath102 [ @xmath103 at @xmath104 [ @xmath105 at @xmath18 . even if an optimistic mass resolution of @xmath106 can be achieved , we see that this irreducible background will be at the level of 250 to 100 events in the indicated mass range . in addition , other backgrounds as well as efficiencies for tagging and event selection must be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our conclusion is that the one - loop processes are unlikely to provide a measurable signal , and certainly can not be used as discovery modes , unless @xmath107 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , there are a variety of perfectly viable higgs sector models in which it would be highly desirable to be able to detect a relatively light cp - odd @xmath0 without relying on associated production with other higgs bosons . </S>",
    "<S> such detection might be crucial to determining the nature of the higgs sector but may be quite difficult . </S>",
    "<S> a linear @xmath35 collider , including the @xmath83 collider option , provides the best range of possibilities for @xmath0 discovery . </S>",
    "<S> even when the @xmath108 pair process becomes strongly kinematically suppressed ( roughly @xmath109 ) , @xmath65 production continues to provide an opportunity for @xmath0 discovery in the moderate-@xmath14 ` wedge ' region of @xmath1 $ ] parameter space where @xmath16 and @xmath110 production both fail . </S>",
    "<S> although this will still leave some portions of @xmath1 $ ] parameter space inaccessible to @xmath0 discovery , it is quite impressive that the tools and techniques that have been developed for higgs detection at the lc have reached a high enough level of sophistication that we should have a good chance of detecting and studying the higgs bosons of even rather unusual higgs sectors .    </S>",
