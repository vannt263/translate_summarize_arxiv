    "we have recently demonstrated  @xcite that one can always expect to be able to reproduce the empirical binding energies for a set of nuclei by introducing a proper density dependent pauli potential in terms of a single variable , the nucleon number @xmath0 .",
    "such a result is the consequence of a delicate counterbalance between kinetic and potential energetic contributions .",
    "a deeper understanding of the nuclear saturation mechanism and reproduction of other observables for nuclei has been made possible due to the richness of available nuclear data . since the pioneering shell model calculations  @xcite and the so - called `` coester band ''  @xcite ,",
    "many microscopic investigations have been devoted to study the properties of many - nucleon systems with a variety of approaches as _",
    "i.e. _ relativistic mean fields  @xcite , quark - based models  @xcite and chiral dynamics  @xcite . on the other hand , studies based on computer simulations with monte carlo techniques and/or ( quantum ) molecular dynamics ,",
    "have proved themselves to be very powerful to investigate many - nucleon systems such as subthreshold kaon production  @xcite and multifragmentation  @xcite in heavy ion collisions , and the _ nuclear pasta _",
    "phase  @xcite .",
    "most of these works , based on semiclassical simulations , treat nuclei as composite objects interacting through effective potentials containing the essential features of the system . especially , the effects of the pauli principle , the basic quantum feature for many - fermion systems , is simulated by means of an effective potential depending on the position and momentum of the interacting nucleons .",
    "this was firstly suggested by wilets _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in the context of classical many - body nuclear models .",
    "later , approaches such as fermionic molecular dynamics ( fmd )  @xcite and antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd )  @xcite , include the pauli principle in a quantum mechanical manner . however , it is still not practical to apply these methods to study heavy nuclei and nuclear matter , due to the need of heavy computational calculation , and unestablished ( anti)periodic boundary conditions to simulate an infinitely large nuclear system  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we go a step further from our previous study  @xcite by considering a refined effective spin - dependent nn interaction and analyzing other nuclear properties for medium mass nuclei and heavy nuclear systems .",
    "we will firstly deduce a corresponding density dependent effective pauli potential reproducing the empirical nuclear binding energies .",
    "for this purpose , without loss of generality , we will focus on medium mass range nuclei with @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out that the spin dependence has only a very moderate impact , with the relevant contributions coming from the in - medium effects of the effective pauli potential .",
    "in addition , we will also evaluate the root mean square radius ( rms ) of spin - isospin saturated nuclei and their density distributions .",
    "when the simulation is extended for idealized infinite symmetric nuclear matter , it turns out that finite size affects the pauli potential strength up to about 120 particles while remaining almost stable for larger systems . the picture arising from the present semiclassical simulation of nuclei , though simplified , accounts for basic properties of these systems . in the medium mass range nuclei , the density dependence could be either described in terms of the nucleon number or , as we will show , a function of the associated nucleus fermi momentum .",
    "this treatment relates to that of recent approaches applied in chiral dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the present description can be considered , then , as an improvement of previous simulation work where neither antisymmetrization effects nor density dependence were considered .",
    "the derived effective pauli potential does not depend on local densities as occurs , for example , in work using skyrme models  @xcite . nonetheless , even if not local , the density dependence in the effective pauli potential becomes crucial to achieve saturation .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ model ]",
    ", we describe the different nuclear potentials used in the simulations .",
    "first , we introduce @xmath3-wave nn interactions without spin nor isospin dependence .",
    "this makes easier to analyze the role of the pauli potential and its nuclear density dependence .",
    "next , we consider improved spin dependent nn interactions .",
    "results will be presented in section  [ results ] , and summary and conclusions will be given in section  [ summary ] .",
    "in this section we present the different simplified nuclear models which will be used in our simulations . we restrict ourselves to spin - isospin saturated , @xmath4 ( even @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) nuclei with mass number @xmath0 in the range @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , nucleons are treated as classical , structureless particles .",
    "first , we consider a nn interaction based on a square - well potential without any dependence on spin nor isospin . while the model is simple , it retains the basic features of the nn interaction , short - range repulsion and intermediate range attraction .",
    "the nn interaction potential between the @xmath7-th and @xmath8-th nucleons is given by , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is their relative distance .",
    "this potential consists of a repulsive core of strength @xmath11 and width @xmath12 , and an attractive well of depth @xmath13 and width @xmath14 .",
    "we will consider values @xmath15 mev , @xmath16 mev , @xmath17 fm and @xmath18 fm .",
    "the core strength gives only a very moderate contribution to the binding energies ( as easily deduced from the different values we may use  @xcite ) , only preventing nucleons from occupying the inner region in configuration space .",
    "however the spatial parameters , @xmath12 and @xmath14 , are crucial to reproduce satisfactorily matter root mean square radii as will be explained later in this section .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is given by , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the 3-momentum of @xmath7-th nucleon with mass @xmath21 .",
    "from now on we will refer to this model as sw .",
    "next , we consider a refined nn interaction including the coulomb potential : @xmath22 where @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the isospin third - component of @xmath7-th ( @xmath8-th ) nucleon ( @xmath25 for protons , @xmath26 for neutrons ) , and @xmath27 is the proton electric charge .",

    "\\label{swc}\\ ] ] we will refer to this model as swc .    since nucleons are fermions , they obey the pauli principle . in the present treatment",
    "this is mimicked by introducing an effective potential , which prevents nucleons from occupying the same phase space volume when they have the same quantum numbers .",
    "this was first suggested by wilets _",
    "et al . _",
    "later , a gaussian form of the pauli potential has been introduced by dorso _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . in this way",
    "one can reproduce well kinetic energies per nucleon in a fermi gas , although it fails to describe other basic features such as two - body correlation functions at low temperature  @xcite .",
    "using this effective pauli potential depending not only on the position but also on the momentum of the interacting fermions in a hamiltonian approach , an effective nucleon mass which grows largely with increasing nucleon density arises .",
    "this results in very slow nucleons , and may lead to quasi - crystallized nuclear fermi gases if not properly considered  @xcite .    in this work we use the pauli potential form proposed by dorso _",
    "_  @xcite ,    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the relative 3-momentum of the @xmath7-th and @xmath8-th nucleons , with @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) being the kronecker s delta for the isospin ( spin ) third - component .",
    "we will differentiate two cases : ( i ) @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are constant fixed to reproduce the empirical binding energy per nucleon ( @xmath36 ) of @xmath37o , 7.98 mev  @xcite , and ( ii ) allow them to be density dependent .",

    "note that with this parametrization of the pauli potential the more general local density dependence has been parametrized in terms of one single parameter based on a simplified fermi gas picture .    in a nucleus",
    ", a typical nucleon sphere radius @xmath40 may be given by , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the nucleon density and @xmath43 the fermi momentum of nucleons in the nucleus .",

    "secondly , we consider another parametrization of the pauli potential allowing a density ( @xmath43 ) dependence trying to reproduce the empirical binding energies for spin - isospin saturated nuclei , together with the relations in eqs .",

    "this may imply that the variable @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ vpden ] ) , is appropriate to characterize the many - nucleon system .",
    "the nn interaction potentials we have described so far may be more generally described by introducing spin dependence .",
    "note that this also implies isospin dependence in order to satisfy the pauli principle .",
    "we consider a simple potential for the spin parallel ( @xmath51 ) and antiparallel ( @xmath52 ) pairs of nucleons : @xmath53 we distinguish three different possibilities for the strength of each spin dependent term : ( i ) model sd1 , where the spin parallel potential is more attractive than the antiparallel , @xmath54 ; ( ii ) model sd2 , the opposite case , @xmath55 ; ( iii ) model sd3 , for the case , @xmath56 .",

    "the different balance between the parallel and antiparallel strengths will allow us to overcome the possible consequences of the simplification including only @xmath3-wave interactions .",
    "inclusion of also the @xmath58-wave interactions , which only couple to the @xmath59 channel ( in the present case , e.g. , the interaction between @xmath60 pair ) would modify the balance between the attraction in the spin parallel and antiparallel cases .",

    "we can see that finite size effects ( particle number ) are important up to values about @xmath95 where the pauli potential strength stabilize to an approximately constant value .",
    "the larger values for small @xmath0 do not match those of finite nuclei since in this case nucleons are artificially constrained in a cube of length @xmath96 .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions as usual to minimize boundary effects near the walls of the simulation box .",
    "it is worth mentioning that as we consider heavier nuclei  @xcite the density dependence parametrized by the fermi momentum must be replaced by the system size , @xmath0 , since one can map out pauli potential strengths in a clearly defined way . in fig .",

    "the density dependent effective pauli potential partially simulates the effect of genuine fermionic correlations on semiclassical descriptions . for medium mass range nuclei with @xmath98",
    "the nucleon number dependence into the effective pauli potential can be replaced in terms of the fermi momentum of the constituent nucleons . even if spin dependent effects are explicitly included in the nn potential , an appropriate parametrization of the density dependence",
    "can still be derived in terms of the fermi momentum .",
    "the density dependence in the effective pauli potential is crucial to reproduce nuclear binding energy saturation , wich is achieved by a balance of density dependent attractive and repulsive contributions in an analogous way to the relativistic mean field approach . although for medium mass nuclei the density dependence can be described in terms of the fermi momenta , the treatment of heavier nuclei requires to consider the density dependence in terms of the nucleon number , due to saturation of the fermi momenta around 270 mev / c .",
    "the use of spin - isospin dependent nn potentials turns out to give only a moderate improvement for the binding energy per nucleon , but it is unable to achieve energy saturation unless a density dependent pauli potential is used .",
    "our results show that , provided a different set of values for the spatial parameters , @xmath12 and @xmath14 or potential well strength , @xmath13 , in the nn potential , a @xmath43 dependent pauli potential strength can always be parametrized to reproduce the empirical nuclear binding energies .",
    "the procedure presented in this work is robust .",
    "then , each set of nuclei modelled by a given nn potential and calibrated by the empirical binding energies , can be tested by studying further properties of nuclei like , for example , when introducing some hyperonic content .",
    "we have shown that , in the density range close to the saturation of nuclear binding energies , and for an idealized snm system the pauli potential strength depends on the size of the system and stabilizes to an approximately constant value around @xmath95 .",
    "the matter rms radii of medium mass range nuclei can be satisfactorily reproduced by tuning the spatial parameters of the nn interaction to a reference nucleus ( in this work taken to be @xmath37o ) .",
    "a close agreement with the typical sizes of nuclei expected from a liquid drop model is obtained .    to summarize ,",
    "the present approach may provide a practical efficient way to model a set of spin - isospin symmetric nuclei calibrated by the empirical binding energies and matter rms radii .",
    "it also can be regarded as a preliminary step for studying further properties of symmetric many - nucleon systems in semiclassical simulations .",
    "it is necessary to provide further insight into semiclassical effective potential models to study wether asymmetric systems can be treated in a similar fashion .",

    "<S> it is shown that the use of a density dependent effective pauli potential together with a nucleon - nucleon interaction potential plays a crucial role to reproduce not only the binding energies but also the matter root mean square radii of medium mass range spin - isospin saturated nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> this study is performed with a semiclassical monte carlo many - body simulation within the context of a simplified nucleon - nucleon interaction to focus on the effect of the genuine correlations due to the fermionic nature of nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure obtained is rather robust and it does not depend on the detailed features of the nucleon - nucleon interaction . for nuclei below saturation the density dependence may be represented in terms either of the nucleon number , @xmath0 , or the associated fermi momenta . when testing the simulation procedure for idealized `` infinite '' symmetric nuclear matter within the corresponding range of densities , it turns out that finite size effects affect the pauli potential strength parametrization in systems up to about @xmath1 particles while remaining approximately stable for larger systems . </S>"
