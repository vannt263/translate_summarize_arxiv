    "superradiant light scattering in a bose einstein condensate provides a striking example of collective enhancement in the interaction of light and matter in ultracold atomic samples @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon is analogous to the collective spontaneous emission studied by r. h. dicke in his seminal paper @xcite . in single atom spontaneous emission",
    ", the intensity of emitted light falls off exponentially at the natural decay rate @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , a dense ensemble of @xmath1 atoms in the electronic excited state can collectively relax to the ground state through the emission of one or more pulses of light @xcite . in ` dicke superradiance '  the multi - atom generalization of the wigner - weisskopf approach to spontaneous emission ",
    "the emitted light pulses have an amplitude that scales as @xmath2 , and a characteristic width @xmath3 ( see figure [ fig : srillust ] ) .    in superradiant light scattering ( sls ) ,",
    "the electronically inverted sample is replaced by an atomic ensemble ` dressed ' by a pump beam .",
    "the pump induces spontaneous scattering in the sample , populating one or more previously unoccupied modes of light .",
    "thus , the spontaneous scattering rate @xmath4 takes the role of @xmath0 in dicke superradiance , and since @xmath5 for standard experimental parameters , the dynamics of sls is in general much slower than dicke superradiance .",
    "stimulated raman scattering from the pump beam into the spontaneously populated mode builds up over a timescale @xmath6 .",
    "in superradiant light scattering , the recoil momentum an atom gains from photon scattering plays a crucial role in the dynamics . in this sense ,",
    "the narrow momentum spread and long - lived motional coherence in a bec is ideal for maintaining the coherence between atomic clouds with different momenta . the dipole emission pattern of the driven optical transition and the sample anisotropy determine which spatial light modes experience the most gain .    in the standard realization of sls",
    ", condensates are produced in cylindrically symmetric harmonic potentials , leading to cigar - shaped clouds where the dominant superradiant light modes are those that propagate along the long axis of the bec - the so - called endfire modes . in the superradiant rayleigh scattering process",
    ", an atom gains a recoil kick from scattering a photon and returns to its initial internal state . in an end - pumped sample ,",
    "where the pump beam propagates co - linear with the endfire modes , the interference of the stationary condensate and a recoiling order leads to a modulation of the atomic density with spatial period @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the wavelength of the incident light .",
    "similarly , the backscattered light interferes with the pump beam , leading to an intensity modulation , again with spatial period @xmath7 . in this way",
    ", the dynamics is determined by the overlap of these light and matter - wave ` gratings ' @xcite , which vary in amplitude and phase over the length of the bec .    .",

    "@xcite with permission from elsevier.,title=\"fig:\",width=291 ] +    from this brief discussion , it is clear that sls is a multi - mode process and that the emission of one or more light pulses from an extended atomic sample is the result of complex dynamics .",
    "experimentally , when imaging the backscattered light on a camera , we observe a unimodal intensity distribution for a given experimental run , but the position and shape of this distribution varies slightly from run - to - run . without resorting to complicated theoretical models that do not make an _ a priori _ single mode assumption @xcite , a standard approach to study dicke superradiance or superradiant light scattering in extended samples is to consider an initial ` quantum ' phase followed by a one - dimensional ` semi - classical ' evolution whereby an assumed single mode of light is amplified @xcite .",
    "our experimental results are well modeled by such an approach , achieving good agreement over a wide parameter range . in this article , we focus on the semi - classical dynamics associated with the amplification and propagation of light in the condensate .",
    "this article extends our previous work @xcite by focusing on the close connection between dicke superradiance and sls and provides a detailed comparison of simulations with experiment .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [",
    "sect : exptal_setup_for_sls ] , we describe the experimental setup . in section [",
    "sect : model ] , we present the 1d maxwell - schrdinger equations used to model the experiment . in section [ coupled ] , we present experimental results , illustrating the strong analogy between dicke superradiance and superradiant light scattering . in particular , we show that the measured superradiant pulses demonstrate the same scaling with scattering rate and atom number as in dicke superradiance . in section [",
    "sect : spatial_dep_dynamics ] , we use the 1d model to illustrate the spatially dependent dynamics within the bec that lead to the observed light scattering .",
    "section [ conclusion ] offers conclusions and an outlook for future work .",
    "we initiate superradiant rayleigh scattering in a trapped bec by exposing it to a pulse of off - resonant light propagating along the long axis of the condensate .",
    "figure [ fig : setup ] shows a schematic of the key features of the experiment .",
    "the bec is generated in a ioffe - pritchard magnetic trap through evaporatively cooling a cloud of @xmath11rb atoms in the @xmath12 hyperfine state ; the bias field is oriented along the long axis ( @xmath13 ) of the trap . typically , we use condensates containing @xmath14 atoms , with in - trap thomas fermi radii of and in the radial and axial directions , respectively , where there is no discernible thermal fraction",
    ". the pump light is detuned by @xmath15 from the @xmath16 transition on the @xmath17 line of @xmath18rb at 795  nm , with @xmath19 the atomic transition frequency and @xmath20 the laser frequency ; the pump light is circularly polarized with respect to the magnetic bias field .",
    "all data presented is for @xmath21  ghz using rectangular pump pulse envelopes .",
    "the superradiant dynamics occur in - trap , with the trapping potential extinguished immediately after the end of the pump pulse .",
    "the pump beam has a gaussian intensity profile and is focused to a waist of 13.2  @xmath22 m at the centre of the condensate with a negligible change in beam waist over the length of the cloud .",
    "light is backscattered by the sample in the same polarization as the input beam ; it is thus reflected by the polarizing beamsplitter ( pbs ) and then impinges on a sensitive detector .",
    "the detector has a bandwidth of 400  khz and is shot - noise limited for photon fluxes greater than @xmath23 photons/@xmath22s ; the bandwidth leads to the smoothing of the detected light over a timescale of @xmath24s .",
    "pictures of the atoms are obtained after 45ms time - of - flight by resonant absorption imaging .",
    "+    this choice of transition and detuning approximates well a two - level atom driven by an applied laser field .",
    "the single particle spontaneous scattering rate for a two - level atom is given by where @xmath25 is the intensity of the applied laser field and @xmath26 is the saturation intensity of the optical transition ; for the studied experimental parameters , @xmath4 lies in the range @xmath27  s@xmath28 .",
    "an atom in the excited state , @xmath29 , can decay to three levels : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , with probabilities @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the small clebsch gordon coefficients for decay into the @xmath36 manifold prevent significant populations accumulating in @xmath30 and @xmath31 via superradiant raman scattering @xcite .",
    "given the low rate of real excitations @xmath4 on the experimental timescale ( @xmath37s ) , and the dephasing that occurs between these states in the magnetic trap @xcite , we neglect these states in our modeling .",
    "in the end - pumped geometry , sls occurs primarily in the light that is backscattered by the atomic ensemble ; this leads to the concomitant scattering of atoms into forward momentum orders separated by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the wavenumber of the pump light .",
    "superradiant backscattering predominates because there is no net momentum change for scattering in the forward direction .",
    "an atom with momentum @xmath38 is generated by the destruction of a pump photon @xmath40 and the creation of a backscattered photon @xmath41 . in rayleigh scattering , the process can occur repeatedly , and , with appropriate parameters , one can generate several diffracted orders in the forward direction .",
    "for single particle scattering rates much smaller than the recoil frequency @xmath423.6  khz , scattering to higher atomic momentum orders occurs sequentially on a time scale .",
    "when @xmath43 , there is sufficient gain for atoms to be backscattered into negative momentum orders , i.e. , the kapitza - dirac regime where atoms absorb backscattered light and re - emit into the forward direction .",
    "the fresnel number of the experimentally studied condensates is approximately one , implying that the main aspects of the system s dynamics may be described by a one dimensional theory @xcite .",
    "the fresnel number is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the radius and @xmath46 the length of the ( assumed cylindrical ) atomic sample ; alternatively , @xmath45 gives the radius of an aperture or waist of a gaussian beam and @xmath46 the distance to the plane of observation .",
    "if @xmath47 , the scattered light is confined to a narrow cone in the forward direction but this comes with the complication of introducing a strong radial dependence on the transverse modes ( @xmath47 marks the region of applicability of fraunhofer diffraction ) .",
    "alternatively , if @xmath48 , the axial modes have little radial dependence but non - axial modes are supported . for @xmath49 ,",
    "the light scattered within the sample retains its transverse distribution along the length of the sample , and furthermore this distribution has little transverse variation ; i.e. , the light within the sample is well - described by a single , approximately flat , transverse mode .      the starting point for the analysis of this system",
    "is the schrdinger equation for the ground state of a two - level atom in the presence of an off - resonant light field , and the wave equation with a polarization source term @xcite : @xmath50 @xmath51 where the total electric field is given by @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the atomic dipole moment , @xmath54 the mass , and the polarization is given by @xmath55 the excited electronic state has been adiabatically eliminated given the assumed low rate of real excitations .",
    "these equations give a self - consistent description of an ensemble of two - level atoms interacting with a classical electric field .",
    "the applied field polarizes the atoms according to quantum mechanics , the dipole moments of these atoms are summed to give the macroscopic polarization @xmath56 , and this enters the wave equation as a source term @xcite .",
    "we assume that the polarization of the atoms is linear in the applied electric field , and therefore that there is no saturation of the atomic transition - a point which needs to be confirmed as a matter of self - consistency in the solution of the problem . indeed , for the parameters considered in this work , this condition is always fulfilled . at this stage",
    ", we neglect the harmonic trapping potential and the mean field term representing interactions between atoms .    to solve the above equations , we make the following approximations . based on the discussion of section  [ sect : exptal_setup_for_sls ] , for an atomic sample with fresnel number @xmath57 , it is reasonable to ignore the transverse spatial variation of the condensate wavefunctions and electric fields . as such",

    "are slowly varying amplitudes for the forward and backward travelling electric fields ; the electric field polarization has been suppressed in equation .",
    "note that in this formalism , we can not distinguish between incident and forward scattered light : @xmath40 contains both components .",
    "such an identification is necessary in a 1d treatment , which assumes that the incident and scattered fields occupy the same light mode .",
    "this identification is supported somewhat by the fact that the pump is partially mode matched to the bec ( see section  [ sect : exptal_setup_for_sls ] ) ; we take account of the spatial overlap between the bec and the pump intensity distribution when calculating the boundary conditions for @xmath40 .    upon substitution of equation ( [ eqn : wfm ] ) into ( [ eqn : sr ] ) ,",
    "we identify terms that oscillate at @xmath63 .",
    "similarly we substitute ( [ eqn : e ] ) into ( [ eqn : wave ] ) and identify terms with the common phase @xmath64 . for the light fields , we make the ` slowly varying envelope approximation ' .",
    "the content of the approximation is to neglect derivatives of the slowly varying envelopes @xmath40 and @xmath41with respect to terms involving the derivatives of the fast oscillating exponentials .",
    "that is , we assume @xmath65 to simplify the ensuing equations , we rescale the position and time variables such that @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",

    "finally , we obtain : @xmath70    @xmath71    with the coupling constants @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "retardation effects have been neglected in equations ( [ eqn : eplus ] ) and ( [ eqn : eminus ] ) given the length of the condensate @xmath74 m , which allows us to discard a time derivative term ; however , with the definition of a retarded time ( in unscaled quantities ) , @xmath75 , the result can be made exact @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ eqn : sr_wf])([eqn : eminus ] ) describe a raman interaction where a ladder of momentum states is coupled by two counter - propagating light fields .",
    "the first term in equation  ( [ eqn : sr_wf ] ) describes the quantum diffusion of the wavefunction envelope and the second term is the momentum displacement of the wavefunction due to the atomic recoil . in our parameter regime and interaction time",
    ", these envelopes are slowly varying and thus contribute very little to the dynamics .",
    "terms three and four describe the coupling between neighbouring momentum states via the exchange of photons between @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the final terms in equation  ( [ eqn : sr_wf ] ) account for phase rotation of the matter wave due to the light shift",

    "specifically , the creation of photons in @xmath77 and recoiling atoms in @xmath78 , and the annihilation of @xmath76 photons and @xmath79 atoms .",
    "the last terms in equations ( [ eqn : eplus ] ) and ( [ eqn : eminus ] ) describe the effect of the slowly varying refractive index on light due to the large scale atomic density distribution .",
    "if one disregards the quantum diffusion and the momentum displacement terms in equation ( [ eqn : sr_wf ] ) , these equations have the symmetry of a four - wave mixing process .",
    "such a four - wave mixing process is non - linear : here , the scattering of atoms depends on the local intensity of light and the scattering of photons depends on the local atomic density . in general , a standing wave of light will arise with spatial period @xmath7 , but comprised of several frequency components shifted by multiples of @xmath80 , which are represented by the exponential terms @xmath81 $ ] in equations ( [ eqn : eplus ] ) and ( [ eqn : eminus ] ) .",
    "given that the effect of these frequency changes on the wavelength is insignificant over the spatial extent of the condensate , they will manifest themselves as time - varying amplitude and phase modulations of the standing wave along the length of the sample , i.e. , a ` walking standing wave ' with a dynamically evolving amplitude .",
    "a similar picture arises on the atomic side : since we consider rayleigh scattering where the internal state of the atoms remains unchanged , condensates with different momenta interfere , leading to a density modulation . in general ,",
    "this matter - wave grating is comprised of as many spatial periods and oscillating frequencies as there are populated momentum orders . in the regime of weak excitation , corresponding to a low single particle scattering rate @xmath4 , only @xmath82 and @xmath83 become significantly populated leading to a spatial period of @xmath7 .",
    "this leads to the physical picture that the atomic density modulation corresponds to a bragg grating with a sinusoidal modulation of the refractive index .    ) .",

    "it is evident that it is primarily atoms centred around zero transverse momentum that are diffracted into the @xmath38 momentum state .",
    "for incident plane waves , the bragg condition for light to be backscattered is fulfilled for those atoms with close to zero transverse momentum .",
    "collisions between 0 and @xmath38 atoms , and to a lesser extent the nearly isotropic spontaneous rayleigh scattering , lead to the visible isotropic scattering halo .",
    "figure [ fig : nice_sr_pic](b ) illustrates the strengths and the weaknesses of the 1d model : the maxwell - schrdinger equations provide a straightforward and physically intuitive picture of the dynamics but the 1d treatment is nonetheless an approximate description .",

    "we scale the field amplitudes @xmath96 derived from experimental parameters by a global factor of 10.5% to achieve the best possible agreement in the arrival time and amplitude of the first superradiant pulse over a wide range of detunings , atom numbers and single particle scattering rates .",

    ", we can regard the condition for superradiant rayleigh scattering as inversion in momentum space , as opposed to electronic state population inversion in dicke superradiance .",
    "evidently , the growth of the coherence @xmath122 is proportional to the number of atoms in the sample ; since this term drives the growth of the field amplitude @xmath77 , the backscattered photon flux is thus proportional to @xmath116 ( see equation  ) .",
    "we note further that the time development of the atomic coherence depends on the light field coherence @xmath124 .",
    "this is consistent with the physical picture that both the local amplitude and phase of the matter and light wave coherences determine the evolution of the system .",

    "figure [ fig : sims_high_delta ] shows the results of our simulations . for three relevant times during the interaction , atomic density distributions along the long axis of the bec are shown in the left column , and the scaled intensities @xmath134 and @xmath135 are shown in the right column .",
    "( see also the supplementary online material for a video of this simulation . )",
    "the backscattered light intensity in the sample builds up at the input end ( @xmath136 ) , since it sees gain from approximately the entire length of the bec ; this is the time shown in the top row ( @xmath137s ) .",
    "this spatial inhomogeneity in the scattering can be directly observed in the atomic density distribution after modest time - of - flight @xcite , because the expansion is slow along the symmetry axis of the condensate @xcite . at this point ,",
    "the rate of transfer of atoms from @xmath82 to @xmath83 concurrent with the growth of @xmath77 and reduction in @xmath76 begins to increase steeply . at the time shown in the second row ( @xmath138s ) , the population in @xmath82 becomes sufficiently depleted at the input edge of the bec that the process slows down and eventually stops .",
    "thus , at this time , the first superradiant pulse reaches its peak amplitude and begins thereafter to decay .",
    "however , the light field envelopes then move towards the centre of the condensate , where @xmath139 is still large , and the exchange between the two light fields can continue ; this is the time shown in the bottom row ( @xmath140s ) .",
    "the result of this dynamics is that @xmath139 grows again at the input end of the condensate , driven there by the annihilation of @xmath83 atoms and @xmath77 photons that were generated further inside the sample .",
    "this time marks the end of the first superradiant pulse . in the simulations , superradiant",
    "ringing arises from the repetition of these dynamics .",
    "the light intensity in both @xmath76 and @xmath77 at @xmath140s shows a local maximum within the bec , implying that the dynamics leads to the formation of an optical resonator , where partially reflecting mirrors are formed by the density modulation due to the interference of stationary and recoiling matter - waves .",
    "these bragg gratings are centered where @xmath82 and @xmath83 cross . however , this feature of the simulations is not manifest in the experimental data , as noted in section [ sect : forms_data_sims ] .",
    "indeed , the experiments support the veracity of the simulations up to times shortly after the peak of the first superradiant pulse , but not the formation of a high - quality cavity by bragg gratings .",
    "the 1d model neglects the transverse variation of these bragg gratings , so that they resemble the paradigmatic fabry - perot etalon formed by two parallel flat mirrors . in real cavities ,",
    "the resonator stability depends critically on the geometry of the mirrors @xcite .",
    "we speculate that the disagreement between simulations and experiment after the first superradiant pulse can be partially explained by the transverse variation of the bragg gratings , in that they do not realize a stable resonator . the slow decay of light intensity after the peak of the superradiant pulse in figure [ fig : data_forms ] is suggestive of decay in an optical cavity .",
    "a full 3d model would allow for the inclusion of the transverse dynamics , effectively turning the single transverse mode description into a transverse multi - mode problem .",
    "this is an interesting but numerically intensive challenge , and beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we have explored the semi - classical aspects of superradiant light scattering in an end - pumped bose einstein condensate , using time - resolved detection of the scattered light as a sensitive probe of the dynamics .",
    "the scaling of the first superradiant pulse s amplitude and width with the pump power was demonstrated , illustrating the analogous role the single particle scattering rate @xmath4 plays in sls to the natural decay rate @xmath0 in dicke superradiance .",
    "additionally , we showed the quadratic scaling of the superradiant pulse amplitude with the sample atom number , which is characteristic of dicke superradiance .",
    "the physical picture of four - wave mixing was developed using 1d maxwell - schrdinger equations to model the dynamics . despite their simplicity",
    ", the simulations achieve very good agreement with the experimentally observed superradiant pulse amplitude and timing .",
    "experimentally , it would be interesting to detect the amplitude and phase ( frequency ) of the backscattered light via heterodyne detection to allow further comparison with the model where the phase is an additional output parameter  @xcite .    in future work , we will explore the quantum aspects of the process . within the framework of the 1d model , the quantum fluctuations that initiate the process",
    "may be included by seeding the dynamics using random initial conditions sampled from the appropriate probability distribution ; in this case , the number distribution of photons of the thermal state of light that arises from spontaneous scattering . in the later dynamics , these random seeds manifest themselves in macroscopic fluctuations of arrival time and amplitude of the superradiant pulses  @xcite . from the microscopic quantum perspective , backscattered photons and recoiling atoms are created in pairs much like the photon pairs in a two - mode squeezed state prepared by spontaneous down - conversion .",
    "this implies thermal statistics throughout the process for atoms and photons separately , as recently demonstrated in @xcite for atoms .",
    "moreover , it implies reduced , ideally vanishing , fluctuations for the number difference between the two modes .",
