    "response of such system to rotation and the onset of vorticity in the condensate are among the most interesting questions attracting attention of both experimentalists and theorists @xcite . in this connection",
    ", it is very important to study the structure and the spectrum of the ground states of rotating condensates at a given angular momentum , called the _ yrast states _",
    "@xcite , see fig .",
    "the notion of yrast states is borrowed from nuclear physics , where the states of many - body system having highest spins at a given excitation energy play also a special role @xcite .",
    "a particular problem of wide recent interest @xcite arises in the so - called weak coupling limit , when the repulsive interactions between bosonic atoms can be considered weak as compared to the spacing between different oscillator levels in the harmonic trap .",
    "this limit is expected @xcite to be reached in future experiments . in particular , an interesting possibility to study different coupling regimes is related to using the feshbach resonance @xcite to vary the strength of the effective interatomic interactions . from the theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "the advantage of the weak coupling limit is that it allows analytical treatment of the problem .",
    "we will consider here @xmath0 spinless bose atoms in a spherically symmetric harmonic trap , assuming the interactions to be weak .",
    "it is sufficient to consider the two - dimensional case , because the three - dimensional case can be reduced to the former in the weak coupling limit , as was shown in refs.@xcite .",
    "it is expedient to start with the case of noninteracting particles .",
    "the noninteracting system has equidistant spectrum @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the trapping oscillator frequency and @xmath3 an integer .",
    "each level is degenerate , and the degeneracy grows exponentially with @xmath3 for @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this degeneracy is related to the number of ways to distribute the total energy @xmath1 among the bose particles .",
    "the short - range interactions @xmath5 between the atoms are assumed weak in the sense that hoppings between different @xmath1 levels can be neglected , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a typical matrix element of the interaction@xcite .",
    "the problem is therefore to find a nonperturbative solution for the highly degenerate states at a single level @xmath1 , which is similar in spirit to the problem of the lowest landau level for the electrons in high magnetic field , which arises in the theory of the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite or to the problem of compound states in an atomic nucleus .",
    "the yrast states are those with minimal energy at given angular momentum , @xmath8 .",

    "the case of repulsive interaction is more difficult to analyze @xcite .",
    "one of the first important results obtained for the repulsive forces was that of bertsch and papenbrock@xcite : these authors diagonalized the repulsive @xmath9-interaction numerically and suggested analytical formulae for the wave functions and energies of the yrast states .",
    "later , it was shown analytically by several authors using various methods @xcite , that the states of the form of bertsch and papenbrock are indeed eigenstates of the hamiltonian . only recently",

    "in fact , we consider a more general problem @xcite , of finding the ground state as a function of two quantum numbers , the total angular momentum , @xmath8 , and the angular momentum of internal excitations ( we discuss this quantity in the following sections ) .",
    "such `` generalized yrast states '' include the usual yrast states as a limiting case .",
    "these solutions are valid in the region @xmath10 .",
    "physical interpretation of the results is quite transparent .",
    "in fact , the form of the yrast wave functions which was drawn from numerics @xcite for the case of @xmath9-interaction , turns out to be valid for a broad class of repulsive interactions .",
    "the universality class of such interactions [ which includes , but is not limited to , delta - forces , gaussian forces with arbitrary range , coulomb ( @xmath11 ) and log - coulomb [ @xmath12 forces ] is described by an explicit sufficiency condition .",

    "in the weak coupling limit discussed in the previous section , the problem splits onto series of independent problems for each value of the total angular momentum @xmath8 . at given angular momentum @xmath8 ,",
    "the hamiltonian ( @xmath13 ) is the sum @xmath14 where the first term ( the c - number equal to the energy of degenerate level ) comes from the noninteracting hamiltonian in the parabolic trap , @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 denoting the momentum and coordinate of the @xmath18-th particle .",
    "hereafter , we set @xmath19 for brevity .",
    "the second , nontrivial , term @xmath20 stems from the two - body interaction @xmath21 projected onto the single - level problem , which is worked out below .    in two dimensional problems involving harmonic potentials , it is convenient to use the complex variable @xmath22 and the conjugated @xmath23 instead of the position vector @xmath24 . introducing the notations @xmath25 and @xmath26 ,",

    "the role of these operator is to raise ( lower ) the powers of @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the preexponentials of many - body wave functions , which are all polynomials times the gaussian factor @xmath34 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath35    the only nonzero commutators between ( [ a - akrest ] ) are given by @xmath36 = [ b_i , b^{+}_j ] = \\delta_{ij } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in two dimensions , the total angular momentum is the difference @xmath37 of numbers of `` up '' and `` down '' quanta , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively . at the same time , the noninteracting hamiltonian on the left hand side of ( [ h0 ] ) is given by @xmath40 by definition , the yrast states have minimum energy at given @xmath8 .",
    "they must therefore belong to the subspace with @xmath41 the first term in ( [ h0 ] ) is therefore reduced to a constant given by @xmath42 the subspace defined by ( [ yrast - condition ] ) is spanned by the homogeneous symmetric polynomials of degree @xmath8 , @xmath43 which do not involve conjugated @xmath44 s at all , @xmath45 the orthogonal basis of these symmetric polynomials can be constructed as follows @xcite .",

    "the problem of finding the spectrum consists of diagonalization of the interaction , the second term in ( [ ham ] ) , in the `` partition subspace '' ( [ polypartition],[partition ] ) ; the eigenvalues of ( [ ham ] ) have the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the interaction contribution .",
    "it should be noted that this term can not be found with any kind of perturbation theory , as it comes from diagonalization of the interaction within the subspace of degenerate states .    in this paper , we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath67 only . at @xmath68 ,",
    "the whole situation is changed drastically .",
    "first , the number of basis states is not given by @xmath55 anymore and it depends on both @xmath8 and @xmath0 .",
    "for example , the simplest states with partition @xmath69 $ ] , which play the role of generating functions for the ground states at @xmath67 ( see section v ) , can not be constructed at @xmath68 .",
