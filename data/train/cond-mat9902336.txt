    "among the various subjects concerning the physics of polymers , the behavior of heteropolymers containing hydrophobic and hydrophilic components in solvents are of particular interest since they have obvious importance in biology @xcite .",
    "it is well known for instance that in a polar solvent , these heteropolymers prefer conformations where the hydrophilic components are in contact with the polar solvent , whereas hydrophobic components avoid contacts with the solvent . the behavior of heteropolymers in the presence of an interface separating two selective solvents , one favorable to the hydrophobic components and the other to the hydrophilic components , is less obvious , and has been much studied recently . in the pioneering work of garel , huse , leibler and orland @xcite ,",
    "a model was proposed and studied via imry - ma arguments , an analysis of the replica hamiltonian and numerics : it was found that a chain with a symmetric distribution in hydrophobic / hydrophilic components is always localized around the interface at any temperature ( in the thermodynamic limit ) , whereas a chain with a dissymmetric distribution in hydrophobic / hydrophilic components presents a phase transition separating a localized phase at low temperatures from a delocalized phase into the most favorable solvent at high temperatures .",
    "experimentally , the presence of copolymers was found to stabilize the interface between the two immiscible solvents @xcite , since the localization of the heteropolymers at the interface reduces the surface tension . by now , the predictions of reference @xcite have been confirmed in the physics community by various approaches including molecular dynamics simulations @xcite , monte carlo studies @xcite , variational methods for the replica hamiltonian @xcite @xcite , and exact bounds for the free - energy @xcite .",
    "mathematicians have also been interested in this model , but the exact results obtained up to now are still far from a complete explicit solution .",
    "the localization at all temperatures for the symmetric case was proven in references @xcite @xcite by various criteria of localization on the paths measure . in the dissymmetric case ,",
    "the existence of a transition line in temperature vs dissymmetry plane was proven in reference @xcite where some bounds for the free - energy were obtained in the asymptotic regimes of low and high temperatures .",
    "finally , the relations between various localization criteria concerning either free - energy or path properties have been studied in reference @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new approach to study the model of garel et al .",
    "@xcite , based on a disorder - dependent real space renormalization procedure . since this type of approach is not usual in the context of the thermodynamics of classical disordered systems , it seems useful to recall how these methods have been successfully applied in other domains .",
    "disordered - dependent real space renormalization approaches have first been introduced in the field of disordered quantum spin chains @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "more recently they have been used to study random walkers in 1d disordered environments @xcite @xcite , reaction - diffusion in 1d disordered environments @xcite and non - equilibrium dynamics of disordered classical spin chains @xcite @xcite .",
    "a similar method has also been introduced independently to study the coarsening of the pure one - dimensional @xmath2 model at zero temperature @xcite . in all these fields , these methods , which are not  exact from first principles \" , have however been remarkably successful in reproducing the exact results that were already known ( see references @xcite @xcite ) , and in producing a lot of novel exact results for exponents and scaling functions for a large variety of physical quantities .",
    "these results apply in the large renormalization scale regime , corresponding respectively to low - temperature in the field of disordered quantum spin chains , and to large time behaviors in the other fields concerning dynamics .",
    "these new predictions have moreover been confirmed numerically whenever they have been tested @xcite @xcite @xcite .    for the random heteropolymer problem , the disorder - dependent real space renormalization procedure that we propose in this paper",
    "is defined to select the  important \" configurations for the thermodynamics of a chain with a given realization of the disordered sequence in hydrophobic / hydrophilic components at a given temperature .",
    "we expect this renormalization approach to become accurate in the large renormalization scale regime , corresponding here to the region of high temperatures .",
    "since the localized phase extends up to a critical temperature @xmath3 that goes to infinity as the dissymmetry parameter of the distribution in hydrophobic / hydrophilic components goes to zero , our approach allows to study the localized phases of symmetric chains and slightly dissymmetric chains .",

    "@xcite , for the symmetric and dissymmetric cases respectively .",
    "they are expected to be valid at high temperature .",
    "the imry - ma argument exposed in @xcite for the symmetric case ( @xmath54 ) can be summarized as follows .",

    ", the optimization of the free - energy per monomer @xmath95 with respect to @xmath91 leads to @xmath96 at high temperature , the scaling of the typical blob length @xmath97 and of the free - energy @xmath46 are therefore given by : @xmath98 and thus the heteropolymer remains localized at any finite temperature .",
    "the imry - ma argument exposed in @xcite for the dissymmetric case is actually much more subtle than in the symmetric case , because to describe correctly the blobs in the @xmath99 solvent , it is necessary to consider the  rare events \" where the sum of random variables @xmath8 of positive mean @xmath100 happens to be negative enough in order to make more favorable for the heteropolymer to make an excursion in the @xmath99 solvent rather than to stay in the otherwise preferred @xmath101 solvent .",
    "more precisely , the imry - ma argument of reference @xcite is as follows in our notations : at high temperature , the heteropolymer is expected to be mostly in the preferred @xmath101 solvent , except when a blob of length @xmath102 in the @xmath99 solvent becomes energetically favorable , with a blob energy @xmath103 that is  sufficient \" . the probability to have @xmath104",
    "is given by the gaussian @xmath105 thus the typical spacing @xmath106 between two such events behaves as the inverse of this small probability @xmath107 as a consequence , in a configuration with blobs of order @xmath108 with @xmath109 , the energy gain @xmath110 due to one excursion in the @xmath99 solvent behaves as @xmath111 whereas the loss of entropy due to this excursion is of order @xmath112 .",
    "the free - energy difference per monomer between this localized state and the delocalized state in the preferred solvent can then be estimated as ( neglecting prefactors of order 1 ) : @xmath113 the optimization with respect to @xmath102 leads to @xmath114 and @xmath115 thus both the energy gain @xmath110 and the entropy cost have the same @xmath116 dependence ! as a consequence ,",
    "the free - energy difference factorizes into @xmath117 where the parameter @xmath118 thus represents the critical temperature between the localized phase @xmath119 and the delocalized phase @xmath120 .",
    "contrary to the symmetric case , the behavior of the free - energy with respect to the temperature remains unknown , since the typical blob length @xmath106 depends upon the temperature t in a way that is not determined by the present argument .",
    "still , the relations ( [ relationlmlp ] ) and ( [ relationflp ] ) between the typical blobs lengths @xmath106 and @xmath102 and the free - energy @xmath46 represent non - trivial tests for any theory constructed to describe the heteropolymer problem .",
    "to go beyond the imry - ma arguments of previous section , one needs to consider probability distributions of blob lengths and blob energies . in appendix",
    "[ appendiximryma ] , we reproduce an extension of the usual imry - ma argument which was introduced by garel and orland @xcite , and which shows how to get the asymptotic behavior of the probability distribution @xmath121 of the blob length @xmath91 in the limit of small @xmath91 . here , to study the probability distributions of blob lengths and blob energies , we will construct via a real - space renormalization procedure the  optimal \" imry - ma domain structure associated with a given heteropolymer at a given temperature .",
    "we will then argue that the configurations corresponding to this optimal imry - ma domain structure dominate in the partition function asymptotically at high temperature .",

    "when we flip the blob @xmath124 surrounded by the two neighboring blobs @xmath125 and @xmath126 , we obtain a new blob of absolute charge @xmath127 and length @xmath91 given by ( see figure [ figrg ] ) @xmath128    1.0 cm    = 10.0 true cm    1.0 cm    the renormalization procedure corresponding to the rules ( [ rgrules ] ) has already been extensively studied in the context of the random transverse field ising chain @xcite , where the role of the absolute charges @xmath129 was played by the logarithm of the random couplings and random fields ( @xmath130 and @xmath131 ) , and in the context of random walks in disordered 1d environments @xcite where the role of the absolute charges @xmath129 was played by the energy barriers @xmath132 . as explained in details in reference @xcite , the renormalization procedure constructs iteratively the large scale extrema statistics of random walks , where only barriers bigger than a given scale @xmath133 are kept . here",

    "we stop the procedure when the next flipping would correspond to a raise of free - energy ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "we will define @xmath143 as the renormalization scale @xmath133 where we have to stop the renormalization .",
    "we now present a dynamical interpretation of the renormalization procedure .      the renormalization procedure defined above to construct the optimal blob structure at temperature @xmath1",
    "can be given a perhaps more direct physical meaning if one considers the dynamics at high temperature @xmath1 for @xmath144 starting from a zero - temperature initial condition at @xmath5 , i.e. after a quench to @xmath4 for @xmath145 .",
    "indeed , the time necessary to flip a blob of absolute charge @xmath127 follows an arrhenius law @xmath146 ( where @xmath147 is a microscopic time scale ) .",
    "the dynamics thus corresponds to the iterative flipping of the blobs of smallest absolute charge remaining in the chain described by the renormalization procedure , where the renormalization scale @xmath133 now corresponds to time via @xmath148 as in references @xcite @xcite .",
    "the dynamics takes place up to time @xmath149 where equilibrium at temperature @xmath1 is reached @xmath150      let us define the effective partition function @xmath151 as the sum over all the configurations that correspond to the disorder and temperature dependent optimal imry - ma domain structure constructed via the renormalization procedure defined above .",
    "the real partition function @xmath152 can be decomposed into @xmath153 the effective thermodynamics based on @xmath151 is of course very approximate at low temperatures .",
    "however , at high temperatures , the renormalization scale @xmath154 will be large and the probability distributions of absolute charges of the blobs will become infinitely broad @xcite .",
    "more precisely in the symmetric case , the difference between the typical value @xmath155 of the absolute charges and the minimum value @xmath156 will also be large and of order @xmath133 : @xmath157 . as a consequence",
    ", we expect that all the configurations that do not correspond approximatively to the optimal imry - ma domain structure will be highly suppressed in the partition function , in comparison with the  optimal configurations \" .",
    "the validity of the effective thermodynamics is thus based on the idea that , for a given heteropolymer at a given high temperature , the large scale imry - ma domain structure is essentially _",
    "unique_.    as explained in the introduction , in the other fields where disordered - dependent real space renormalization approaches have been used , they have been able to reproduce the non - trivial exact results obtained previously via other methods ( see references @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "these agreements with the mc coy - wu exact results in the field of disordered quantum spin chains @xcite , and with the kesten - golosov distribution in the field of 1d random walks in random media @xcite have provided the best evidence for the asymptotic exactness of the renormalization approach in these fields , and give confidence in all its other novel predictions .",
    "here for the heteropolymer problem , we do not have at our disposal so precise exact analytical results derived via other methods to  test \" unambiguously the asymptotic exactness of the predictions of the renormalization approach . as a consequence ,",
    "we hope that in the future , the explicit results of the renormalization approach presented in this paper will be tested precisely by numerical studies",
    ". it would be also very interesting to test more directly the idea of the dominance of the optimal imry - ma domain structure in the partition function , by comparing , sample by sample , the typical configurations of the heteropolymer at equilibrium at temperature @xmath1 with the optimal blob structure obtained by the numerical implementation of the renormalization procedure up to scale @xmath143 .",

    "we have then studied the finite - size properties of the problem by considering cyclic finite ( large ) chains . in particular , we have given the probability distribution of the delocalization temperature for the ensemble of chains of fixed finite length @xmath0 , and the distribution of the numbers of blobs in the chain still localized at some temperature .",
    "finally , we have briefly discussed the non - equilibrium dynamics at temperature @xmath1 starting from a zero - temperature initial condition .    in conclusion ,",
    "the disorder - dependent renormalization approach yields explicit predictions for the high temperature behaviors of various physical quantities , that would certainly be interesting to test precisely by numerical studies .",
    "in particular , the predictions concerning the critical behaviors near the delocalization transition are certainly surprising , and disagree with the monte carlo studies of reference @xcite where power laws were found , and with the replica gaussian variational approach of reference @xcite where the transition was found to be of second order . it would thus be particularly worthy to test numerically more precisely the order of the transition .",
    "we hope that the predictions of the renormalization approach concerning the finite - size properties of the problem presented in section [ finite ] will make easier the comparison with numerical studies .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that the renormalization approach yields not only predictions for averages over the quenched disorder , but also precise predictions sample by sample .",
    "for instance , for a given realization of the quenched charges , one may compare the typical configurations of the heteropolymer at equilibrium at temperature @xmath1 with the blobs structure obtained by the numerical implementation of the renormalization procedure up to scale @xmath143 .",
    "for the case of cyclic chains , one may also test numerically sample by sample the renormalization prediction for the delocalization temperature .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank t. garel , h. orland , and e. guitter for fruitful discussions , and t. garel for his useful remarks on the manuscript .",
    "in this appendix , we recall the determination via a direct imry - ma argument @xcite of the asymptotic behavior of the probability distribution of blob lengths in the limit of small lengths , and compare it with the renormalization result .    as noted by garel and orland @xcite , one may extend the usual imry - ma argument for the heteropolymer exposed in reference @xcite to obtain not only the scaling of the typical length of imry - ma domains , but also some information on the probability distribution of the length of domains .",
    "the idea is as follows @xcite . on one hand ,",
    "the energy associated to a blob of length @xmath91 is the sum of @xmath91 independent random variables and is thus typically given by @xmath409 where @xmath410 is a random variable of order 1 , that has at least to be positive since the system tries to use the favorable fluctuations of the disorder to lower its energy . according to @xcite , the probability distribution for large @xmath410 is simply given by the gaussian of the central limit theorem : @xmath411 the behavior of the distribution @xmath412 for small @xmath410 seems however not simple to determine a priori , because the small values of @xmath410 are certainly suppressed with respect to the gaussian distribution .",
    "indeed , if an imry - ma domain corresponds to a small value of @xmath410 , it is very likely that the heteropolymer will prefer an organization into other imry - ma domains .",
    "it seems however difficult to write precisely the consequences of this effect on the distribution @xmath412 . on the other hand ,",
    "the entropy associated to a blob of length @xmath91 behaves as @xmath413 ( in @xcite , only powers of @xmath91 were considered for the symmetric case and thus @xmath93 was replaced by @xmath94 , but here for a better comparison with the renormalization approach , it is more convenient to keep this @xmath93 dependence ) .",
    "the minimization of the free energy per monomer @xmath414 with respect to @xmath91 leads to @xmath415 the typical blob length @xmath416 corresponding to @xmath417 thus satisfies @xmath418 since within the rg approach @xmath419 , the above equation corresponds to equation ( [ gammaeqt ] ) with the choice @xmath420 i.e. a numerical factor of order 1 . now introducing the rescaled length of imry - ma domains",
    "@xmath421 we find that it is simply related to the random variable @xmath410 through @xmath422 the behavior ( [ ularge ] ) of the distribution @xmath412 at large @xmath410 thus corresponds to the following behavior of the distribution @xmath203 at small @xmath163 : @xmath423 where @xmath424 is a constant of order 1 .",
    "this asymptotic behavior corresponds exactly to the behavior ( [ pdelzero ] ) found via the renormalization approach .",
    "concerning the behavior of @xmath412 for small @xmath410 , we explained above why it is difficult to determine it a priori . using the relation ( [ ulambda ] ) ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior ( [ pdelinfty ] ) found via the rg approach @xmath425 would correspond to @xmath426 i.e. a very strong suppression of small values of @xmath410 for the energies of imry - ma domains .",
