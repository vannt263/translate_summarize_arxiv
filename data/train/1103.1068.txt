    "@xcite has emerged as a computationally efficient alternative to molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations for problems where the atomic and the continuum scale are tightly coupled .",
    "the reason is that it operates for atomic length scales and diffusive time scales .",
    "thus for a simple application such as diffusion in gold or copper it runs @xmath5-@xmath6 times faster than the corresponding md calculation @xcite . in that sense it provides from point of view of multiscale materials modeling an interesting link between the traditional phase - field method and md .",
    "moreover , a connection between classical density functional theory of freezing and phase - field crystal modeling could be identified in @xcite .",
    "thereby a second theoretical foundation besides the swift - hohenberg amplitude equation approach could be established .",
    "essentially it motivates the application of pfc models also for spatially non - uniform _ non - periodic _ states .",
    "recently the phase - field crystal method has been applied to a variety of different growth phenomena .",
    "one of its interesting features is that other than the phase - field method , in which elasticity explicitly needs to be integrated in the functional to be taken into account @xcite , it includes elastic effects inherently .",
    "thus it allows to simulate for example features of crack propagation @xcite and plasticity @xcite from the atomic to the micro - scale .",
    "to model the elastic behavior of different kinds of materials , the parameters of the phase - field crystal model equation can be adjusted to match the elastic moduli of a given experimental system . however , in its most simplistic form , in which it is a reformulation of the swift - hohenberg equation @xcite with a conserved dynamics as introduced by elder _",
    "_ @xcite the poisson ratios which can be modeled , are restricted to @xmath7 ( in the one mode approximation )",
    ". moreover , since in the simplistic pfc model the material is defined by only three parameters , it is restricted with respect to the crystal lattice structures which it can describe as well .",
    "these are triangular symmetries in two dimensions and @xmath8 symmetry in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "another crystal symmetry applying to protein crystals in a membrane could be obtained by including higher order correlation functions @xcite . moreover ,",
    "liquid crystals have been simulated by combining the original phase - field crystal equation with an orientational field @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "we followed the above direction to extend the phase - field to apply to a larger class of condensed matter systems taking a different route : we derived a generalized pfc model for isotropic as well as anisotropic crystal lattice systems of arbitrary poisson ratios as well as condensed matter systems built - up from non - spherical units such as for example anisotropic colloids and liquid crystals . to this end",
    "we extended the simplest pfc model proposed by elder @xcite , to a conservative , anisotropic langevin equation and applied it to the heterogeneous nucleation of colloids at a wall .    whereas our previous work @xcite was devoted to a mere introduction of our model and its application to heterogenous nucleation at a wall , here",
    "we show for the first time how its parameters can be derived from dynamical density functional theory ( ddft ) ( see ) .",
    "further we report for the first time in detail on its morphology diagram .",
    "to do so , we proceed as follows : first we give a thorough derivation of our anisotropic phase - field model based on the ddft in .",
    "we then - after a brief summary of the model in - study the influence of anisotropy and undercooling on the morphology of the final states .",
    "we analyze these morphologies and summarize our results in terms of a morphology diagram in .",
    "finally we conclude with a summary and an outlook of our study in .",

    "periodic nature of a crystal lattice is incorporated by using a free energy functional which is minimized by periodic density field .",

    "this pfc model is basically an extension of the spfc model which is derived in @xcite .",

    "as an example the simulation results with @xmath83 and for two typical values of @xmath13 i.e. with @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively at 40,000 time steps are depicted in .",
    "[ htbf ]      in this section we studied the dependence of a stable state phase on anisotropy and undercooling .",
    "more specifically , we show how a stable state can be composed of different phases such as triangular phase , stripe phase and co - existance of stripes and triangular phase , depending on the values of @xmath77 and @xmath13 i.e. anisotropy and undercooling respectively . to study these patterns we performed a number of simulations with different values of @xmath77 and @xmath13 in each simulation .",

    "[ h ]    the precise shape of the grain boundary between the two solid phases depends on the system size due to @xcite . the two - phase coexistence as such",

    "the stable state consists of stripes when @xmath87 irrespective of the @xmath13 value , as shown in .",
    "it is observed that the stripe phase obtained for different values of @xmath77 are different from each other in terms of the spacing between the neighbouring stripes in the stripe phases .",
    "however , simulations with different values of @xmath13 result in similar stripe phases .",
    "our results reveal that the spacing between neighbouring stripes decreases with an increase in the value of @xmath77 .",
    "thus the stripe phase obtained with @xmath89 are much finer compared to the ones obtained with @xmath90 .",

    "[ h ]    from the above discussion , we can conclude that the distance between neighbouring stripes decreases as we increase the value of @xmath77 .",
    "however , the undercooling has no significant effect on the stable stripe phase , i.e.  the stripe phases for different values of @xmath13 are similar .      in this section",
    "we discuss the influence of the anisotropic factor @xmath77 on the final triangular phase obtained with @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "more specifically , we analysed the form of triangles in each of the final triangular phase .",
    "the form of a triangle is determined in terms of three internal angles and ratio of length of the longest and shortest sides of the triangle .",
    "it is observed that the triangular phase obtained in case of @xmath83 i.e. without any anisotropy , consist of triangles with same three angles of @xmath93 each .",
    "however , the triangular phase obtained with non - zero values of @xmath77 contains triangles with dissimilar sides .",
    "the details of the angles calculated for each case are shown in .",
    "[ h ]    these results demonstrate that for isotropic case i.e. @xmath83 , the final triangular phase consist of equilateral triangles .",

    "the ratio of length of the longest and shortest sides of the triangles , calculated for each case is presented in .",
    "this underlines the capability of our apfc model to give rise to truly anisotropic morphologies .",
    "in this article we presented a ddft based derivation of the apfc model proposed by two of the authors ( d.  l.  and h.  e. ) in @xcite previously .",
