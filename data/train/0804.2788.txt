    "random ising systems represent an interesting theoretical laboratory in which one can study general features of disordered systems . among them , the two - dimensional ( 2d ) random - site and random - bond ising models have attracted much interest . in particular , the effects of quenched disorder on the critical behavior at the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic transitions , which are observed for sufficiently small disorder , have been much investigated and debated ,",
    "see refs .  .",
    "renormalization - group ( rg ) and conformal field theory @xcite predict the marginal irrelevance of random dilution at the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic transition . therefore , the asymptotic behavior is controlled by the standard ising fixed point , characterized by the critical exponents @xmath1 and @xmath2 ; disorder gives only rise to logarithmic corrections .",
    "the marginality of quenched disorder coupled to the energy density , as it is the case for random dilution , is already suggested by the harris criterion,@xcite which states that the relevance or irrelevance of quenched dilution depends on the sign of the specific - heat exponent of the pure system ; in the case of the 2d ising model , the specific heat diverges only logarithmically at the transition , i.e. @xmath3 . the marginal irrelevance of disorder has also been supported by numerical studies of lattice models ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "( see , however , refs .   for different scenarios ) .",
    "we recall that in three dimensions random dilution is a relevant perturbation of the pure ising fixed point , leading to a new three - dimensional randomly diluted ising ( rdi ) universality class , which is characterized by different critical exponents ; see , e.g. , refs .  .    in this paper",
    "we return to the issue of the critical behavior of 2d randomly diluted ising systems . by using the rg results reported in refs .",
    ", we show that their critical behavior can be derived from the rg equations @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the flow parameter ( the logarithm of a length scale ) , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the scaling fields associated with the leading operators of the three different conformal families of the 2d ising model , i.e. the identity , energy , and spin families , and @xmath9 is the marginally irrelevant scaling field associated with disorder .",
    "higher - order terms in eqs .",
    "( [ gop ] ) are not necessary , because they can be reabsorbed by appropriate analytic redefinitions of the scaling fields .",
    "the appearance of the term @xmath10 in the first equation , where @xmath11 is a nonuniversal constant , is due to the resonance of the identity operator with the thermal operator , which already occurs in the pure ising model.@xcite it is interesting to note that randomness couples only to the thermal scaling field @xmath7 .",
    "it would be interesting to understand if these conclusions also apply to the irrelevant operators , i.e. , if the only operators that couple disorder are those that belong to the conformal family of the energy .",
    "the analysis of the rg equations shows that random dilution gives rise to logarithmic corrections which are universal after an appropriate normalization of the scaling field associated with disorder .",
    "additional scaling corrections due to the irrelevant operators are suppressed by power laws as in standard continuous transitions . for these reasons",
    ", we prefer to distinguish the randomly dilute ising ( rdi ) critical behavior characterized by the rg equations ( [ gop ] ) from the standard 2d ising universality class of pure systems , although they share the same 2d ising fixed point .",
