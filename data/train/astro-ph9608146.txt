    "qso spectra and the survey for high redshift damped absorbers are presented in storrie - lombardi  ( 1996 ) [ paper ii ] .",
    "the evolution of the cosmological mass density of neutral gas at high redshift and the implications for galaxy formation theories are discussed in storrie - lombardi , mcmahon & irwin ( 1996 ) [ paper iv ] . in separate papers we will describe the intrinsic properties of the qsos and studies of the forest clouds at high redshift . a high resolution study of the forest region in a redshift @xmath29 qso has been completed by williger  ( 1994 )",
    ".    how and when galaxies formed are questions at the forefront of work in observational cosmology .",
    "absorption systems detected in quasar spectra provide the means to study galaxy formation and evolution up to redshifts of approximately five , back to when the universe was less than 10 percent of its present age .",
    "surveys for absorption features have several advantages over trying to directly detect galaxies at high redshift .",
    "much shorter exposure times are required because the qsos are relatively bright ( r@xmath30 18 - 19.5 ) and the large equivalent width systems are easily detected in the spectra .",
    "this provides good absorption candidates to follow up with higher resolution spectra .",
    "the redshift and column density can be accurately determined from the wavelength of the absorption system and the line profile .",
    "this is far easier and more reliable than trying to directly get a spectrum of a very faint high redshift galaxy .",
    "while the baryonic content of spiral galaxies that are observed in the present epoch is concentrated in stars , in the past this must have been in the form of gas .",
    "the principal gaseous component in spirals is neutral hydrogen which has led to surveys for absorbers detected by the damped lines they produce ( wolfe  1986 , hereafter wtsc ; lanzetta  1991 , hereafter lwtlmh ; lanzetta , wolfe & turnshek 1995 , hereafter lwt ; wolfe  1995 ; paper ii ) .",
    "though damped systems are observationally very rare objects with @xmath3140 confirmed examples known , the  mass per unit comoving volume they contain is roughly comparable to the mass density of baryonic matter in present - day spirals , ie . a major constituent of the universe ( wolfe 1987 , lwt ) .",
    "their metal abundances are much lower than galactic values ( pettini , boksenberg & hunstead 1990 ; rauch  1990 ; pettini  1994 ) and they are characterised by low molecular content and low , but not negligible , dust content ( fall , pei & mcmahon 1989 ; pei , fall & bechtold 1991 ; pettini  1994 ) , features consistent with an early phase of galactic evolution",
    ". they may be the progenitors of spiral galaxies like our own and are clearly important for the study of the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "they have been detected across a very large redshift range z@xmath30[0.5,4.5 ] providing the means to pinpoint the epoch of formation of disk galaxies and study their evolution .",
    "eleven candidate damped absorption systems out of 32 measured features were identified in 27 spectra of the mainly non - bal quasars from the apm z  4 survey ( paper ii ) .",
    "the eleven candidates cover the redshift range @xmath0 ( 8 with @xmath1 ) and have estimated column densities @xmath2 10@xmath3 atoms @xmath4 . in this paper the qso br1144@xmath60723 with a candidate absorber at z@xmath53.26 is removed from further consideration in the sample .",
    "it has been observed with the anglo - australian telescope at high resolution and the damped candidate has been found to be all  absorption at z@xmath54.0 ( r. hunstead , private communication ) .",
    "high resolution echelle spectra ( 0.8  fwhm ) were obtained by s. dodorico as part of the eso key programme studying high redshift quasars for four of the qsos in the apm sample ( bri0952@xmath60115 , br1033@xmath60327 , bri1108@xmath60747 , br1202@xmath60725 ) .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio in bri0952@xmath60115 was very poor but the other spectra have been used to confirm two features as damped with another falling just below the log @xmath2 20.3 threshold .",
    "we have discovered the highest redshift damped absorber known at z@xmath54.383 in qso br1202@xmath60725 .",
    "the confirmation of the absorption systems is discussed in section 2 .",
    "these data have been combined with data from previous surveys ( wtsc , lwtlmh , and lwt ) and the results for the lyman limit systems obtained in paper i to study the  column density distribution for @xmath12@xmath7 17.2 and redshift evolution of these systems for 0.008 @xmath8 z @xmath8 4.7 .",
    "numerous authors have studied the distribution of column densities , @xmath32 , for absorption lines .",
    "the first determination was by carswell  ( 1984 ) for lines with @xmath33 @xmath34 atoms @xmath4 .",
    "they found @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "damped absorption ( dla ) systems comprise the high column density tail of neutral hydrogen absorbers with column densities of @xmath37 atoms @xmath4 .",
    "they dominate the baryonic mass contributed by .",
    "when damped systems are included in the column density distribution function for a single power law fit the exponent is @xmath38 = 1.41.7 (  tytler 1987 ; petitjean  1993 and references therein ) . assuming the baryonic mass is proportional to the  column density and takes the form @xmath39 for the  column density distribution function , the mass contribution from the damped systems can be estimated as @xmath40.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath41 one problem with the power law representation is that if @xmath42 , as all current estimates indicate , then the total mass in damped systems diverges unless an upper bound to the hi column density is assumed .",
    "for example , if we take 20.3  log @xmath43  22 , the fractional contribution to the total hi mass for damped systems , @xmath44 , is then @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "however , there is no a priori reason for assuming this upper limit and hence there is no strict upper bound to any estimate of the total hi mass in damped systems .",
    "an alternative parameterisation using a gamma function to describe the hi column density distribution was adopted by pei & fall and provides an elegant solution to the diverging mass problem .",
    "we discuss these points in more detail in section 3 and the redshift evolution of the absorbers in section 4 .",
    "echelle spectra of four qsos were obtained in march , 1993 by s. dodorico as part of an eso key programme studying high redshift quasars .",
    "they were taken at la silla with the 3.5 m ntt telescope using the emmi instrument in echelle mode using a 2048@xmath492048 pixel loral ccd as the detector .",
    "a slit of 15 `` in length was used and generally the slit width was 1.2 '' .",
    "two grating setups were used , one covering 4700 - 8300  and the other covering 5800 - 9500  with a resolution of @xmath3140 km s@xmath50 ( 1 ) .",

    "the observations are summarised in table  [ t_obs_eso ] .",
    ".eso observations march , 1993 [ cols= \" < , < , > , < , < \" , ]      a single power law fit to the combined data set described above of the form in equation  [ fnzeqn ] with @xmath51 results in @xmath52 and @xmath53 with similar values for @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the quoted error for the normalisation constant @xmath56 is large because for a small change in the value of @xmath38 , @xmath56 can change by 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the results found by lwtlmh ( @xmath57 , log k@xmath58 ) and are plotted for the entire data set in figure  [ f_dlafn_all ] .",
    "the data is binned for display purposes only with the vertical error bars plotted at the mean column density for each bin .",
    "we will see in the next section that a single power law is not a good fit to the data .",
    "as shown in paper i for the lyman - limit system evolution , the arbitrary binning of the data for presentation in differential plots includes a subjective component that can mask exactly what is happening in the underlying data .",
    "a cumulative distribution plot is far better at revealing the true nature of the distribution and this approach is examined now .",
    "the @xmath12 of the cumulative number of damped systems detected versus @xmath12  is plotted in figure  [ f_dlacum](a ) . a point for the expected number of lyman - limit systems that would be detected down to @xmath12 @xmath59",
    "is shown with a circled star .",
    "this is calculated by integrating the number density per unit redshift ( @xmath60 ) over the redshift path covered by the @xmath61 qsos in the dla sample , @xmath62 @xmath63 it is obvious from figure 3(a ) that a power law will not fit the entire column density range 17.2 @xmath28 log @xmath28 22 .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) yields a probability of less than @xmath64 that the fit represents the underlying data set . in figures  [ f_dlacum](b - d )",
    "the same distribution is overplotted with single power law fits for different values of @xmath38 that were fit to the graph by eye .",
    "( b ) shows that @xmath65 will fit from the lyman limit column density through the damped systems with @xmath12 @xmath66 , a flatter slope than the canonical 1.5 - 1.7 range .",
    "( c ) shows that @xmath67 fits the damped distribution with @xmath68 @xmath69 well but does not describe the high or low column density tails of the distribution .",
    "( d ) shows a fit to the sharp drop off in numbers for damped systems with @xmath12  21.3 .",
    "this can be expected from looking at the estimated column densities for the damped systems in table  [ t_dla ] or by looking at the spectra .",
    "there are not a lot of heavily damped systems .",
    "clearly the results for a single power law fit depend critically on the range of column densities included .",
    "this characteristic can explain much of the variation in the results previously seen by various authors that were summarised in section 3.1 .      to qualitatively study the redshift evolution of the column density distribution of the damped systems the cumulative distribution shown in figure  [ f_dlacum ] has been split in half at redshift 2.5 and each set plotted individually ( figure  [ f_zsplit ] ) .",
    "the damped systems with @xmath70 are shown by the solid line and the absorbers with @xmath71 are shown by the dashed line .",
    "the higher redshift absorbers appear to have a slightly flatter slope up to @xmath12 @xmath521 and then a sharper drop in the number of very high column density systems , though a k - s test shows that this is not a statistically significant difference .",
    "the evolution with redshift in the slope of the column density distribution is also apparent when looking at the differential @xmath72 .",
    "lwt plotted this in 3 redshift bins z@xmath5[0.008,1.5],[1.5,2.5 ] , and [ 2.5,3.5 ] . in the highest redshift bin",
    "there was a flattening of the column density distribution slope towards higher column densities . in figure  [ f_dlafn ]",
    "we have plotted our combined data set with this same binning with the addition of one higher redshift bin z@xmath5[3.5,4.7 ] .",
    "the flattening of the distribution function towards higher column density systems in the z@xmath5[2.5,3.5 ] bin in the lwt data is no longer pronounced .",
    "the most striking feature is the steepness of the distribution in the highest redshift bin .",
    "it is not just steeper due to a decrease in the highest column density systems ( log @xmath721 ) , but there is also an increase in the number of lower column density systems relative to the other bins . even if 15 - 20% of the candidate systems with log @xmath3020.3 turn out not to be damped when observed at higher resolution , as we expect , this result still holds",
    "there are two strong motivating factors to find an alternative model for describing the hi column density distribution .",
    "first , as shown in section 3.4 , there is direct evidence for an apparent variation in the power law slope as a function of @xmath43 .",
    "this implies that a higher order functional form other than a power law is needed to describe the column density distribution .",
    "second , as noted in the introduction , with a power law model the integral mass contained within damped ly@xmath73 systems is divergent for realistic values of @xmath38 .",
    "this in turn means that it is impossible to assign a formal upper limit to any estimate of the neutral gas content of the early universe .",
    "consequently , following pei and fall ( 1995 ) , we have chosen to model the data with a gamma distribution of the form @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the characteristic number of absorbing systems at the column density @xmath76 , and @xmath76 is a parameter defining the turnover , or ` knee ' , in the number distribution .",
    "both @xmath75 and @xmath76 may in general vary with redshift but for the moment we treat them as constants .",
    "this functional form is similar to the schechter luminosity function ( schechter 1976 ) .",
    "for @xmath77 the gamma function tends to the same form as the single power law , @xmath35 ; whilst for @xmath78  @xmath76 , the exponential term begins to dominate .",
    "we can understand how a gamma function might provide a better description of the damped ly@xmath73 data by considering the differential logarithmic slope which is given by @xmath79 as the column density approaches @xmath76 the slope begins to steepen and rapidly turns over at higher column densities , qualitatively similar to what we observe in figures  [ f_dlacum ] and  [ f_zsplit ] .",
    "furthermore , the integral hi over the column density distribution (  equation  [ himass1 ] ) for @xmath80 is now given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 denotes the standard gamma function .",
    "this function is bounded if @xmath83 .    the maximum likelihood technique outlined in appendix a",
    "can readily be modified to incorporate this form .",
    "we note that the likelihood solution can be found over a two - dimensional grid of pairs of values of @xmath76 and @xmath38 , since the constant @xmath75 can be directly computed using the constraint @xmath84 where m is the total number of observed systems .",
    "this is computationally much less intensive than doing a 3-d grid search .",
    "the results of a single functional fit to the entire dataset are log @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the log - likelihood function results with confidence contours are shown in figure  [ f_gamconf](a ) .",
    "the best fit is overplotted on the differential form of @xmath72 in figure  [ f_gamconf](b ) and on the cumulative distribution in figure  [ f_gamconf](c ) .",
    "( the single power law form of @xmath72 was shown fitted to the same data in figures  [ f_dlafn_all ] and  [ f_dlacum ] ) .",
    "the differential form of the plots ( figures  [ f_dlafn_all ] and  [ f_gamconf](b ) ) show little difference between the single power law and @xmath85-distribution fits .",
    "when displayed with the cumulative number of absorbers in figure  [ f_gamconf](c ) , the @xmath85-distribution now clearly fits the entire data set with column densities log @xmath2 20.3 .",
    "if the expected number of lyman - limit systems are included in the fit , the results are log @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",
    "this also provides a reasonable fit to the data as shown in figure  [ f_gamconf2](a - c ) .",
    "differential evolution in the number density of damped absorbers has been described by lwt and wolfe  ( 1995 ) .",
    "while the change in number density per unit redshift is consistent with no intrinsic evolution of the absorbers over the range 0 @xmath8 z @xmath8 3.5 , they find that the systems with log @xmath89 disappear at a much faster rate from z@xmath53.5 to z@xmath50 than does the population of damped absorbers as a whole .",
    "we now examine the redshift evolution of the damped absorbers in our combined data set by determining the number density of absorbers per unit redshift , @xmath90 . in a standard friedmann universe for absorbers with cross section @xmath91 and number density @xmath92 per unit comoving volume @xmath93",
    "it is customary to represent the number density as a power law of the form @xmath94 where @xmath95 .",
    "this yields @xmath25 = 1 for @xmath96 = 0 and @xmath25 = 1/2 for @xmath96 = 1/2 for the case of no evolution with redshift in the product of the number density and cross section of the absorbers @xcite",
    ".    a maximum likelihood fit to the data yields @xmath97 which is consistent with no intrinsic evolution even though the value of @xmath25 is similar to that found for the lyman limit systems where evolution is detected at a significant level ( paper i ; stengler - larrea  1995 ) .",
    "the log - likelihood function for @xmath25 and @xmath98 with @xmath768.3% and @xmath795.5% confidence contours is plotted in figure  [ f_maxz ] .",
    "we also find redshift evolution in the higher column density systems but with a decline in @xmath26 for z@xmath73.5 .",
    "these results are displayed in figure  [ f_dndz ] .",
    "the entire data set is plotted as dashed lines with the above fit .",
    "the results for only the absorbers with log n(hi)@xmath99 are shown as solid lines .",
    "figure  [ f_zhi ] shows hi column density versus redshift , and the paucity of absorbers with log @xmath7 21 at z @xmath7 4 is apparent .",
    "three qsos from apm survey have been observed at 0.8  resolution .",
    "two have damped systems with confirmed hi column densities of @xmath2 10@xmath3 atoms @xmath4 , with a third absorber falling just below this threshold .",

    "have been combined with data from previous surveys to study the column density distribution and number density evolution for absorbers with  @xmath2 17.2 .",
