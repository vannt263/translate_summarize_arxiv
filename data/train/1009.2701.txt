    "the wmap mission makes measurements for the cmb with two antennas , a and b , and records in time - order the raw uncalibrated tod @xcite @xmath1 with the instrument gain @xmath2 and baseline @xmath3 , the calibrated tod can be obtained as @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the antenna temperatures of the antennas a and b , respectively , that would be measured if the spacecraft cmb - frame velocity dipole were zero , @xmath7 is the doppler dipole signal induced by the motion of spacecraft @xmath8 with @xmath9 k being the cmb monopole , @xmath10 the speed of light , @xmath11 the velocity of the observer relative to the cmb rest frame , @xmath12 and @xmath13 the unit direction vectors of the antenna a and b respectively .",
    "should consider the transmission imbalance , as given by eq .",
    "3 of  @xcite .",
    "we have adopted the exact form in our data analysis ; however , it s also confirmed that this simplified form is accurate enough in this work .",
    "the sun velocity to the cmb rest frame we used is @xmath14 km / s in the galactic coordinate . ]",
    "the amplitude of the doppler dipole signal is about 3mk , nearly two order of magnitude stronger than the cmb anisotropy ( @xmath15k ) . for sky",
    "map - making , the dipole signal has to be subtracted from the calibrated tod to get the dipole - subtracted tod @xmath16    the calibration parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 in eq.[dr ] are determined by a dipole - based calibration procedure @xcite , where the doppler dipole signal is initially taken as a standard which can be calculated by eq.[dip ] from the spacecraft direction and velocity data .",
    "thus an error in evaluating the dipole signal could be expected to induce the calibration parameters in error , and then twist the calibrated tod .",
    "furthermore , a small error in evaluating the doppler dipole may arouse a significant consequence on the final cmb temperature map via the dipole subtraction ( eq . [ ds ] ) .",
    "for example , in dipole calculation with eq.[dip ] , an antenna direction deviation as small as @xmath17 , just about a half - pixel in the usual wmap resolution with the resolution parameter @xmath18 @xcite , or @xmath19ms timing asynchronism , can cause the differential dipole signal and then the dipole - subtracted tod to be biased by @xmath20k @xcite .",
    "therefore , the doppler dipole signal plays a key role throughout the wmap data processing , and its error should be inspected very carefully .",
    "the wmap spacecraft is continuously scanning the sky .",
    "for each datum @xmath21 or @xmath22 observed at a provided time @xmath23 in the science data table of the wmap tod archive @xcite , one has to derive @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 from the meta data table and calculate the corresponding doppler signal by using eq.[dip ] .",
    "it is obvious that , in both data - calibration and map - making , the time @xmath23 used to calculate the doppler signal @xmath27 must be synchronous to the time @xmath23 of the science datum @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "but we found in the wmap tod archive that the meta data table is not recorded simultaneously with the science data table : a datum in the meta data table is recorded 25.6ms later than the corresponding science datum in the science data table for all bands , in other words , there exists a -25.6ms timing - offset between the meta data table and the science data table ( liu , xiong & li 2010 ) .",
    "such a timing - offset , if were incorporated into the calibration procedure without being corrected , would induce a significant error in the calibrated tod and then on the cmb map due to improperly evaluating the doppler - induced signal @xmath27 . to check the suspected timing - offset - induced error in the official wmap",
    "calibrated tod , roukema ( 2010b ) recently studies the median per map of the temperature fluctuation variance per pixel as a function of assumed timing - offset and proves that the results are consistent with a -25.6ms offset at @xmath28 whereas the hypothesis of no timing error in the wmap calibrated tod is rejected at a significance of @xmath29 . in this work ,",
    "we use a more direct technique to show the existence of timing - offset - induced error in the official wmap calibrated tod .",
    "let @xmath30 denotes the observation time for the @xmath31-th datum in the wmap time - ordered data , @xmath32 the released wmap calibrated differential datum at @xmath30 , @xmath33 the real dipole component existed in @xmath32 . for an assumed timing - offset @xmath34 , we can compute the dipole component @xmath35 at time @xmath36 by eq.[dip ] with @xmath37 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 all at @xmath36 and obtain the dipole - subtracted tod @xmath38+[d^{(w)}(t_i)-d(t_i+\\delta t)]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the statistic @xmath39 ^ 2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\sum_i\\ { [ t_a(t_i)-t_b(t_i)]^2+[d^{(w)}(t_i)-d(t_i+\\delta t)]^2 + \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{8 mm } + \\ , 2 [ t_a(t_i)-t_b(t_i)][d^{(w)}(t_i)-d(t_i+\\delta t)]\\}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the doppler dipole signal is causally determined only by the motion of the spacecraft , unrelated to the astrophysical temperature fluctuations , the third term of the sum in the second line of eq.[v ] , i.e. the cross - term between @xmath40 and @xmath41 in eq.[v ] , summed over @xmath31 , is likely to vary randomly around zero as @xmath34 is varied ( we postpone further discussion of this term to  [ sec : cons ] below ) . without timing error in the wmap data calibration ,",
    "the dipole @xmath33 really existed in the calibrated tod should be identical to that calculated with @xmath42 , thus we have @xmath43 in the right side of eq.[dsw ] and @xmath44 is on average minimized at @xmath42 . however , if there exists an uncorrected non - zero timing - offset @xmath45 between the spacecraft attitude data and science data during the wmap data processing , then we have @xmath46 , and , consequently , @xmath44 is on average minimized at @xmath47 .",
    "thus , we can produce doppler signal sets with different timing - offset @xmath34 and compute the statistic @xmath44 respectively .",
    "the average of all timing - offset @xmath45 that minimize @xmath44 is a proper estimation of the amplitude of suspected timing error in the wmap data processing .      in the wmap tod archive",
    ", each science frame contains 15 - 30 observations , and each observation last for a duration @xmath48 which is 102.4ms , 76.8ms , and 51.2ms for q- , v- and w - band , respectively . following the convention used in previous works ( liu , xiong & li 2010 ; roukema 2010a , 2010b ) ,",
    "the timing - offset used in this work is a relative one in percentage of the duration @xmath48 of each observation @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the time for the instantaneous doppler dipole signal @xmath51 , and @xmath52 the starting time of each observation .",
    "if the time used for the science data and spacecraft attitude data are synchronous , then the time for the instantaneous doppler dipole signal @xmath51 should be at the center of each observation and @xmath53 ( same for all bands , neglecting the @xmath48 difference .",
    "that s why the relative time @xmath54 is preferred ) .",
    "similarly , if the time for the instantaneous doppler dipole signal @xmath51 is at the start of each observation ( e.g. , due to timing offset ) , then @xmath55 , and in case of the end of each observation we have @xmath56 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath34 and @xmath54 is    @xmath57    for reducing the effect of foreground emission , we use the kq75 mask @xcite to remove all observations with either side in the mask . in calculating @xmath58 with eq.[dsw ] ,",
    "eq.[v ] and eq.[dtdtr ] , the argument @xmath54 is taken from -6 to + 6 with a step of 0.1 . for each waveband , we compute for one - day observation periods and record the @xmath59 that minimizes @xmath58 for each one - day period . for all 7-year tod , there are about @xmath60 .",
    "finally , we pick out all @xmath61 ( this excludes @xmath62 data ) , compute the average @xmath63 and the standard error of @xmath63 by @xmath64 to give the final relative timing - offset estimation .",
    "the obtained @xmath63 are @xmath65 , and @xmath66 for q- , v- and w - band , respectively .",
    "the corresponding results for the average timing - offset @xmath67 are listed in table1 , and the histogram plots of one - year s @xmath59 is also shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : hist ] .",
    ".timing offset in wmap data .",
    "if there is no problem in the official wmap calibrated tod , then we should expect @xmath68ms for all bands .",
    "however , this is apparently not true , indicating that there is a timing - asynchronism problem in the wmap data processing . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to test the @xmath63 estimation , we use a secondary method in which we pick out all @xmath61 likewise , then smooth them with a 20-point - window boxcar filter , then count its histogram with 120 bins , and then fit the histogram with gaussian distribution and take the center of the fitted gaussian peak as the best - fit @xmath59 estimation .",
    "the obtained @xmath63 for q- , v- and w - band from the secondary method are 0.282 , 0.108 and 0.060 , respectively , well consistent to the primary method .     before smoothing for the wmap q - band ( shown in the upper panel ) , v - band ( middle panel ) , and w - band ( bottom panel ) , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=25.0% ]   before smoothing for the wmap q - band ( shown in the upper panel ) , v - band ( middle panel ) , and w - band ( bottom panel ) , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=25.0% ]   before smoothing for the wmap q - band ( shown in the upper panel ) , v - band ( middle panel ) , and w - band ( bottom panel ) , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=25.0% ]    if there is no timing error in the official wmap calibrated tod , we should get a nearly zero @xmath67 for each band , but from table1 we can see that such a hypothesis is rejected at least at @xmath69 ( estimated by the band with the lowest significance for this ) and the existence of a -25.6ms asynchronism in the wmap calibrated tod is within @xmath70 ( estimated by the average value in the last line of table 1 ) , both are consistent with  @xcite .",
    "the above result of checking the timing error in the wmap tod demonstrates that the official wmap calibrated tod @xmath71 have been incorrectly calibrated because of incorrect usage of the doppler dipole signal @xmath7 .",
    "ideally , for the uncalibrated science data @xmath72 we should use @xmath73 instead of @xmath23 to estimate the doppler dipole @xmath7 in eq .  3 and find @xmath2 and @xmath3 in eq .  1 , in order to recalculate the calibrated science data @xmath74 , and then derive sky maps from @xmath74 without any further timing offset .",
    "however , an easier , approximate method on large scales is to use @xmath73 instead of @xmath23 in making maps from the ( incorrectly ) calibrated science data @xmath71 that are publicly available on the wmap website .",
    "to show the consequence of the timing error upon the official wmap calibrated tod , as an example , the quadrupole ( power at @xmath0 ) derived with pseudo-@xmath75 method from the wmap5 official cmb maps is @xmath76k@xmath77 ( by convention , the given value is @xmath78 ) ) , but in the modified map recovered from the new dipole - subtracted tod @xmath79 with -25.6ms timing - offset correction in evaluating the doppler dipole @xmath7 , the quadrupole decreases down to @xmath80k@xmath77  the timing error in calibration can generate an artificial quadrupole signal , leading the cosmological cmb quadrupole to be significantly overestimated in the wmap release , we have obtained fully consistent quadrupole result to the wmap release ( using wmap5 tod , kq85 mask and all q , v , w bands , and such conditions are same for a none - zero @xmath81 ) , indicating that our map - making and quadrupole estimating processes are fine . ] .    in previous works ( liu , xiong & li 2010 ; moss , scott & sigurdson 2010 ;",
    "roukema 2010a ) , it has been discovered and confirmed that , given @xmath82 ms and without using any cmb data , an artificial quadrupole component that is very similar to the released wmap cmb quadrupole can be produced ( fig .  [",
    "fig : compare ] ) .",
    "this strongly questions the validity of the wmap result , and indicates that most of the released wmap cmb quadrupole might be artificial because of the timing asynchronism effect , as demonstrated by  @xcite and this work .",
    "the diagnosed timing error in this work might be due to coincidental correlation between the foreground emission and the quadrupoles in fig .  [",
    "fig : compare ] ( no matter `` real '' or artificial ) .",
    "since the spherical harmonics @xmath83 with different @xmath84 or @xmath85 are exactly uncorrelated , this is same to the quadrupole of the foreground emission being correlated with fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] . however , as shown by fig .",
    "[ fig : quad of foreground ] , the quadrupole component of the foreground emission is apparently uncorrelated with any one in fig .  [",
    "fig : compare ] .",
    "moreover , as shown in table 1 , the obtained @xmath67 is nearly frequency - independent .",
    "these two facts strongly suggests that we can safely ignore the foreground issue in this work .",
    "it might also be worried that the true cmb quadrupole might be coincidentally correlated with the artificial quadrupole caused by the timing - asynchronism effect . in this case , the similarity we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] is just something by chance .",
    "however , we have generated @xmath86 randomly distributed quadrupole pairs @xmath87 obeying the basic cosmic principles , especially the following two : there is no preferred axis , and there is no preferred spherical harmonic component ( which means , the power expectations in @xmath88 for all @xmath83 components with @xmath0 and @xmath89 should be identical ) .",
    "for each pair , we calculate the correlation coefficient between @xmath90 and @xmath91 , and with @xmath86 pairs we see that the probability of coincidentally getting a correlation coefficient greater than 0.8 ( which is the correlation coefficient between the two panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] ) is about @xmath92 .",
    "thus we reject the assumption that the timing asynchronism effect we find in this work is due to coincidental correlation ( in other words , the cross - term in eq .",
    "[ v ] ) at 0.025 confidence level .",
    "ms timing offset .",

    "_ right panel : _ the released wmap cmb quadrupole component .",
    "both in galactic coordinate and units of mk . reproduced from fig . 2 of our own work  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=22.0% ]",
    "it s also worthwhile to notice that , our work is done in the tod space , which is significantly different to the temperature map space .",
    "therefore , even if there were strong correlation in the temperature map space , it does not necessarily mean the same strong correlation in tod space ( the cross - term in eq .",
    "this fact could further decrease the worry about the correlation issues .",
    "in previous works we have found notable systematical errors in released wmap temperature maps @xcite , which have been confirmed by other independent works ( e.g. aurich , lustig & steiner 2009 ) .",
    "we then independently developed a self - consistent software package for wmap data processing , and from the wmap tod produced new cmb maps which are significantly different from the official maps ( liu & li 2009b , 2010a ) .",
    "our pipeline codes are already publicly released on the website of tsinghua center for astrophysics and the cosmocoffee forum .",
    "later , in searching for the source of the difference between our and official maps , we discovered a -25.6ms asynchronism between the spacecraft attitude and radiometer output timestamps in the official wmap meta and science data tables , respectively ; such a timing - offset , if not be properly corrected in data processing , should generate serious consequences in the recovered cmb map and power spectrum ( liu , xiong & li 2010 ) .",
    "we artificially introduced the -25.6ms asynchronism into our pipeline to simulate the wmap manner and then obtained fully consistent result to the wmap team indeed .",
    "according to the well consistency between the -25.6ms timing - offset directly observed from tod  @xcite and indirectly probed by  @xcite and this work , the most natural explanation should be existence of an unwanted timing error in the wmap data .",
    "however , such an unwanted timing error is also expected to introduce a blurring effect in recovered maps , but  @xcite did not find such effect in wmap official maps .",
    "recently , by comparing the median per map of the fluctuation variance per pix in the temperature map for different assumed timing - offsets ,  @xcite proved that there does exist an about -25.6ms timing - offset in the wmap calibrated tod , which is confirmed by us in this work directly in the wmap tod , and we further show that the uncorrected timing error occurred at least in calculating the doppler dipole signal .",
    "a natural explanation for above findings is that the timing - offset - induced error in direction did not have an effect in the compilation of the calibrated tod into sky maps by the actual jupiter pointing measurements @xcite , but the calibration error , which on large scales consists of a timing - offset - induced pseudo - dipole signal already present in the calibrated tod , remains present in the sky maps .",
    "it has to be noticed that the error in sky - map - based determinations of cmb dipole direction @xcite can also contribute to the diagnosed timing - offset . in other words ,",
    "the timing - offset detected in this work is a synthesis of errors in timing and in dipole direction .",
    "besides the detected timing offset , other observational reasons , i.e. the sidelobe pickup contamination from dipole , can also generate artificial quadrupole aligned with what observed in the official cmb map , needed to be further removed by model fitting @xcite .",
    "after template - based removal of artificial quadrupole , the remaining quadrupole power can be as low as @xmath93 , significantly lower than @xmath80k@xmath77 derived in this work , indicating that the sidelobe - pickup - induced artifact can not be ignored .",
    "the timing asynchronism in the wmap raw data might be a problem special for the wmap mission , whereas errors in dipole direction and sidelobe contamination are common problems for all cmb missions .",
    "to quantitatively estimate the effect of producing artificial cmb large - scale anisotropies from each possible source by thoroughly rechecking the wmap data processing process is very important , not only for the wmap - based cosmological study , but also for the planck and other future cmb missions .",
