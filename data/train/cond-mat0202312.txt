    "[ fig1 ] that the core sizes are in agreement with these estimates .",
    "when the radius of the vortex ring increases , the core lies at a lower density region and therefore its size increases .    to study the vortex ring energetics we have chosen a larger condensate made of @xmath82 atoms of @xmath72rb confined in an axially symmetric trap with axial frequency @xmath83 hz and three different geometries , namely spherical , disk - shaped and cigar - shaped , with @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively .",

    "fixed @xmath0 , the nucleation energy is maximum when the ring is in the @xmath2 plane , and it decreases as @xmath100 increases , since displacing the ring outwards implies that the superfluid flow affects less atoms in the condensate .",
    "note that to have the vorticity line within the tf boundary , the @xmath0-curves end at different values of @xmath101 given by @xmath102 .",
    "the nucleation energy does not vanish when the ring is located on the tf boundary as there still exists a superfluid velocity field which produces some effect .",
    "since we treat the superfluid velocity as an external field , the nucleation energy of very superficial vortex configurations may be somewhat overestimated .",
    "this drawback is apparent beyond the tf boundary , and shows up as a long - tailed nucleation energy as a function of either @xmath103 or @xmath104 , although it goes eventually to zero .",

    "as in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we have only described vortex ring configurations inside the tf boundary . for this reason , fixed a @xmath100 value the corresponding nucleation energy curve stops at the value @xmath106 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows that for each asymmetry parameter @xmath107 , given a @xmath100 there exists a vortex configuration corresponding to a certain radius @xmath0 that maximizes the nucleation energy .",
    "this radius increases as @xmath100 decreases . in the ( @xmath65 ) two - dimensional configuration space ,",
    "the nucleation energy @xmath108 has only one maximum at @xmath109 .",
    "it is in agreement with the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for a spherically symmetric trap using a simplified model of a vortex ring .",
    "this maximum corresponds to the only stationary , although unstable , vortex ring configuration ( equivalent to a vortex line nucleated along the @xmath1-axis ) , whose location is almost independent of @xmath107 but its value depends on it , decreasing as @xmath107 does .",
    "this means that the energy to nucleate a vortex ring characterized by the values of @xmath47 is lower the more elongated the trap is .",
    "for each asymmetry parameter , the ` iso - nucleation energy ' lines in the ( @xmath65 ) configuration space corresponding to a value not too far from the maximum value are closed curves around the maximum , and the allowed ring radii are in the range defined by the intersection of a straight line representing the given nucleation energy and the @xmath75 curve in fig .",
    "if we relax the condition that the vorticity line must be inside the tf boundary , this should be always like this@xcite .",
    "otherwise , the isoenergy lines eventually do not close . yet",
    ", the allowed ring radii are determined in a similar way .",
    "we have considered the vortex ring as if it were a static object . however , in a trapped condensate a vortex ring will move with a velocity that results from the interplay between the effect caused by the inhomogeneity of the condensate and self - induced effects arising from its own local curvature @xcite . a qualitative analysis of the dynamics of coaxial vortex rings can be carried out from figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and tested in a real time dynamics for two - component condensates@xcite .",
    "it can be seen that a coaxial vortex ring oscillates inside the condensate , moving towards the surface and instead of being annihilated at the boundary , the ring generates a background flow in the rest of the cloud that draws it back towards the center .",
    "the ring dynamics in a trapped condensate results in an oscillation along the symmetry axis of the trap .",
    "the radius of the vortex ring grows or shrinks depending on its @xmath100-position , in such a way that the ring motion almost follows a trajectory with constant energy in the @xmath47 configuration space .",
    "finally , we have used a completely different method , numerically more involved , to generate quantized vortex rings .",
    "it does not make any assumption on the superfluid velocity field , nor on the radius or position of the vortex ring either , and can be used to test the results we have obtained based on the validity of the approximation @xmath110 .",
