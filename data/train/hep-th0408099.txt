    "recently , brane world models with large ( non- ) compact extra dimensions have gained a lot of interest @xcite .",
    "these models assume that we live on a 3-brane embedded in a higher dimensional manifold . the standard model fields and particles",
    "are confined to the brane , while gravity , which is a property of space - time itself , lives in the full dimensions .",
    "the idea that matter is confined to a lower dimensional manifold is not a new idea .",
    "the localisation of fermions on a domain wall has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "recently , it was newly motivated by results from string theory . in type",
    "i string theory so - called dp - branes exist on which open strings , which represent matter fields , end . gravitational fields , which are represented by closed strings , live in the full dimensions .",
    "however , as is well known , newton s law in 4 dimensions is well tested down to @xmath0 mm .",
    "thus appropriate brane world models should localise gravity `` well enough '' to the 3-brane .    in @xcite ,",
    "the localisation of gravity in more than one extra dimension has been discussed .",
    "this was achieved by studying higher dimensional topological defects such as nielsen - olesen strings @xcite and magnetic monopoles @xcite in 6 and 7 space - time dimensions , respectively .",
    "it was found @xcite that gravity - localising ( so - called `` warped '' ) solutions are possible if certain relations between the defect s tensions hold .    originally introduced to remove singularities associated with point - like charges in electrodynamics @xcite , the generalisation of the born - infeld ( bi ) action to non - abelian gauge fields has gained a lot of interest in topics related to string theory @xcite .",
    "it became apparent that when studying low energy effective actions of string theory the part of the lagrangian containing the abelian maxwell field strength tensor and its non - abelian counterpart in yang - mills theories has to be replaced by a corresponding ( resp .",
    "abelian and non - abelian ) bi term .",
    "that s why it seems interesting to generalise the brane world scenario for 6-dimensional nielsen - olesen strings recently proposed by giovannini , meyer and shaposhnikov ( gms ) @xcite to born - infeld actions .",
    "this was done in @xcite and it was found that gravity - localising solutions do nt exist in a 6-dimensional einstein - born - infeld - higgs model . here , we review the results and extend the discussions done in @xcite .",
    "the action reads : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the bulk cosmological constant , @xmath3 is the fundamental gravity scale with @xmath4 and @xmath5 the determinant of the 6-dimensional metric .",
    "moreover , we have the covariant derivative @xmath6 and the field strength @xmath7 of the u(1 ) gauge potential @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is the vacuum expectation value of the complex valued higgs field @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the self - coupling constant of the higgs field .",
    "the ansatz reads @xcite : @xmath12 for the metric and @xmath13 for the gauge and the higgs field @xcite , where @xmath14 is the vorticity of the string .",
    "the equations of motion can be computed easily ( see @xcite for details ) and depend after the rescalings @xmath15 , @xmath16 only on the coupling constants @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the system of equations has been solved numerically subject to the following boundary conditions : @xmath21 at the origin and @xmath22 at infinity .",
    "we have studied the set of equations numerically .",
    "we find that several branches of solutions exist .",
    "the pattern of these branches is very similar than in the 4 dimensional case @xcite . for small gravitational coupling , @xmath23 ,",
    "the gravitational deformations of the nielsen - olesen string solutions as well as so - called melvin solutions exist for the same values of the coupling constants .",
    "they differ , however , in their asymptotic behaviour .",
    "the metric functions on the string branch behave like @xmath24 , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 are constants depending on @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the metric functions on the melvin branch have the following asymptotic behaviour : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , where again @xmath34 and @xmath35 are constants depending on the coupling constants . for @xmath36 closed solutions with zeros of the metric functions exist .",
    "for the so - called inverted string branch , which represents the strong gravity analogue of the string branch , the metric function @xmath37 possesses a zero , @xmath38 , while @xmath39 stays finite at this @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , a so - called kasner branch exists .",
    "the solutions on this branch possess a zero of the metric function @xmath39 , @xmath41 , while @xmath42 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show the dependence of the critical value @xmath43 on @xmath30 for @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 . as is clearly seen , @xmath43 increases with increasing @xmath30 and tends to zero for @xmath47 .",
    "this likely stems from the fact that the mass of the vortex decreases with increasing @xmath30 and thus the strong gravity limit is reached for higher values of the gravitational coupling .",
    "furthermore , the critical value of @xmath29 for a fixed @xmath30 decreases with the winding number @xmath14 as can be seen when comparing the two curves for @xmath45 and @xmath48 .",
    "again , this can be explained by the increased mass of the vortex solution .",
    "interestingly , the pattern of solutions persists for @xmath49 . for the @xmath50 limit",
    ", it was found in @xcite that so - called `` anti - warped '' and gravity - localising ( `` warped '' ) solutions exist .",
    "however , no classification was done . in @xcite",
    ", it was demonstrated that the `` anti - warped '' solutions are the by the presence of the cosmological constant deformed string and melvin solutions , while the warped solutions are the solutions on the limiting line between the kasner and inverted string solutions .",
    "of course , this is only possible if a fine - tuning between the coupling constants is done , i.e. warped solutions exist only for specific triplets @xmath51 of the coupling constants . in fig.[fig1 ] , we give the value of @xmath52 in dependence on @xmath30 for @xmath53 and @xmath45 , @xmath48 .    as can be seen from fig.[fig1 ]",
    "gravity - localising solutions for a fixed @xmath54 , @xmath55 exist for lower values of the gravitational coupling for the @xmath48 solutions than for the @xmath45 solutions .",
    "it is interesting to study how the value @xmath52 for @xmath49 is related to the value @xmath56 for @xmath44 for a fixed value of @xmath30 .",
    "we have studied this question in some detail and as can be seen from fig.[fig1 ] , our results reveal that the curves are more or less parallel .",
    "this holds true for both @xmath45 and @xmath48 .",
    "we thus find the following approximate relation : @xmath57    this completes the analysis done in @xcite in the sense that here we have determined the dependence of @xmath56 and @xmath58 on both @xmath30 and @xmath14 .",
    "let us remark that it was found @xcite by an analytic argument that no gravity - localising solutions exist if @xmath59 . of course",
    ", this result could be different if higher order corrections ( e.g. higher derivative terms of the gauge field ) , which appear in the low energy effective action of string theory , are included .",
    "brane world models have attracted a lot of attention recently . since",
    "newton s law is very well tested in 4 dimensions now , proper models should localise gravity well enough to the 3-brane .",
    "randall - sundrum models possess one extra codimension . for more than one extra dimension ,",
    "alternative models have to be looked for . in @xcite , models with 2 and 3 codimensions have been studied by using topological defects in higher dimensions . here , we have discussed further properties of the solutions in the 6-dimensional einstein - abelian - higgs model . we have determined the @xmath30 dependence of the critical gravitational coupling @xmath56 for @xmath44 .",
    "further we have determined how the gravitational coupling @xmath58 , for which gravity - localising solutions exist , depends on @xmath30 and @xmath14 .",
    "we found an interesting relationship between @xmath56 and @xmath58 .",
    "we thank the organisers of the 6th alexander friedmann seminar and the institut dtudes scientifiques de cargse for their hospitality .",
