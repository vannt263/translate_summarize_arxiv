    "there is at present a growing interest in electron - phonon non linearities also triggered by the signatures of a large anharmonicity observed in metal diborides @xcite .",
    "phonon anharmonicities have a long story in solid state physics closely related to the inelastic neutron scattering theory @xcite .",
    "as the anharmonic effects are generally small in crystals up to room temperature , second order perturbation theory suffices to determine the lifetime due to three phonons decay processes while the renormalization of the frequencies , together with the three phonons terms , also requires computation of the four phonons vertex in the first order diagram plus a ( dominant ) contribution due to the thermal expansion of the crystal @xcite .",
    "it is known @xcite that most properties of real materials can be well described by replacing the anharmonic phonons with the temperature dependent renormalized harmonic phonons , that is assuming quasi - harmonic vibrational models @xcite .",
    "instead , the damping of some anomalous bulk and surface phonons requires explicit computation of the anharmonic interactions @xcite .",
    "however , neither first principles calculations of anharmonicities based on density functional perturbation theory @xcite nor empirical force constant approaches do separate the bare phonon - phonon interactions from the non linearities due to the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the latter contribution is generally incorporated in the former by fitting the third and fourth derivatives of the interatomic potential to experimental thermoelastic properties . in systems such as polymers , whose thermal and conducting behavior is shaped by the strength of the e - ph coupling , one would desire to estimate the amount of _ e - ph _ anharmonicity which may become relevant in the low temperature region where , instead , the phonon - phonon interactions tend to vanish .",
    "theoretical investigations on polymers usually depart from the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) hamiltonian @xcite in which the _ e - ph _ coupling is the derivative of the electron hopping integral with respect to the intersite atomic displacement .",
    "as the electron propagator couples to the oscillator displacement the ssh model can be attacked by the path integral method @xcite which allows one to derive the time dependent probability amplitude for a particle in a bath of oscillators @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "considering the electron particle path as the disturbing source for the phonon subsystem one may evaluate the amount of _ e - ph",
    "_ anharmonicity by expanding perturbatively the phonon partition function .",
    "analysis of the cumulant terms versus temperature would permit to assess the relevance of the _ e - ph _ interactions in the ssh model .",
    "this paper addresses precisely this issue focussing on the computation of some equilibrium thermodynamical properties .",
    "the path integral method for the model hamiltonian is outlined in section ii while the results are given in section iii .",
    "section iv contains some final remarks .",
    "in one dimension the ssh hamiltonian is :    @xmath1 \\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath2 is the nearest neighbors hopping integral for an undistorted chain , @xmath3 is the electron - phonon coupling , @xmath4 is the displacement of the atomic group on the @xmath5 lattice site along the molecular axis , @xmath6 and @xmath7 create and destroy electrons ( i.e. , @xmath8 band electrons in polyacetylene ) on the @xmath5 group .",
    "the non - interacting hamiltonian is given by a set of independent oscillators .",
    "we transform the real space hamiltonian of ( 1 ) into a time dependent hamiltonian @xmath9 by introducing @xmath10 and @xmath11 as the electron coordinates at the @xmath12 and @xmath13 lattice sites , respectively .",
    "the spacial _ e - ph _ correlations contained in ( 1 ) are then mapped onto the time axis by changing : @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "accordingly we get :    @xmath16 \\label{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    eq.(2 ) shows the semiclassical nature of the model in which quantum mechanical degrees of freedom interact with the classical variables @xmath17 .",
    "as the electron hops are not constrained to first neighbors sites along the chain @xmath9 is more general than the real space ssh hamiltonian in ( 1 ) . setting @xmath18 , @xmath19 , averaging the electron operators over the ground state we obtain the average energy per lattice site linearly depending on the displacements :    @xmath20 + g[x(\\tau ) , \\tau ] \\bigr ) \\label{3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 , with @xmath22 the chain length and @xmath23 the lattice constant .",
    "@xmath24 ( proportional to @xmath2 ) is the effective term accounting for the @xmath25 dependent electronic hopping while @xmath26 is the external source current for the oscillator field , @xmath27 $ ] being the electron propagator .",
    "taking a large number of oscillators ( @xmath28 ) as the _ bath _ for the quantum mechanical particle whose coordinate is @xmath10 , the general electron path integral is given by :    @xmath29   \\ , \\nonumber \\\\ \\times & & exp\\biggl[-\\int_0^{\\beta } d\\tau \\biggl({m \\over 2 } \\dot{x}^2(\\tau ) + v\\bigl(x(\\tau)\\bigr ) -",

    "let s replace the source current of the ssh model by a linear ( in the electron path ) current @xmath45 .",
    "this allows us to derive analytical expression for the cumulants as shown , for the lowest order , in the appendix .",
    "let s approximate the electron path by its @xmath25 averaged value : @xmath46 . and expand the oscillator path in @xmath47 fourier components :    @xmath48    taking the measure of integration    @xmath49    with @xmath50 , we obtain for the @xmath51 cumulant the expression    @xmath52    let s set @xmath53 in the following calculations thus reducing the effective coupling @xmath54 by one order of magnitude with respect to the bare value .",
    "the trend shown by the results hereafter presented does not depend however on this choice since @xmath55 and @xmath3 can be varied independently . as the cumulants should be stable against the number of fourier components in the oscillator path expansion , using ( 9 ) we set the minimum @xmath47 through the condition @xmath56 .",
    "noticing that odd@xmath57 terms vanish the thermodynamics of the anharmonic oscillator can be computed by the cumulant corrections to the harmonic phonon free energy :    @xmath58 \\label{10}\\ ] ]    to proceed i need a criterion to find the temperature dependent cutoff @xmath59 in the cumulant series .",
    "in the low @xmath60 limit the third law of thermodynamics may offer the suitable constraint to determine @xmath59 .",
    "then , given @xmath3 and @xmath44 , the program searches for the cumulant order such that the heat capacity and the entropy tend to zero in the zero temperature limit . at any finite temperature t ,",
    "the constant volume heat capacity is computed as    @xmath61 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\times & & \\bigl({1 \\over \\delta } + { t \\over \\delta^2 } \\bigr ) \\label{11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath62 being the incremental step and @xmath59 is determined as the minimum value for which the heat capacity converges with an accuracy of @xmath63 .",
    "figs.1(a ) and 1(b ) show phonon heat capacity and free energy respectively in the case of a low energy oscillator for an intermediate value of _ e - ph _ coupling .",
    "harmonic functions , anharmonic functions with second order cumulant and anharmonic functions with @xmath59 corrections are reported on in each figure .",
    "the second order cumulant is clearly inadequate to account for the low temperature trend yielding a negative phonon heat capacity below @xmath64 while at high @xmath60 the second order cumulant contribution tends to vanish .",
    "instead , the inclusion of @xmath59 terms in eqs.(10 ) and ( 11 ) leads to the correct zero temperature limit although there is no visible anharmonic effect on the phonon heat capacity throughout the whole temperature range being @xmath65 perfectly superimposed to the harmonic @xmath66 .",
    "note in fig.1(b ) that the @xmath59 corrections simply shift downwards the free energy without changing its slope versus temperature . by increasing @xmath54 , the low t range with wrong ( negative ) @xmath67 broadens ( see fig.2(a ) ) whereas the @xmath59 contributions permit to fulfill the zero temperature constraint and substantially lower the phonon free energy ( see fig.2(b ) ) .",
    "thus , for the particular choice of constant ( in @xmath25 ) source current we find that the _ e - ph _ anharmonicity renormalizes the phonon partition function although no change occurs in the thermodynamical behavior of the free energy derivatives .",
    "anharmonicity is essential to stabilize the system but it leaves no trace in the heat capacity .",
    "incidentally we note that a similar role for the anharmonic interactions has been proposed to explain the low frequency behavior of glasses @xcite .",
    "figure 3(a ) displays the @xmath59 temperature dependence for three choices of _ e - ph _ coupling in the case of a low energy oscillator : while , at high @xmath60 , the number of required cumulants ranges between six and ten according to the coupling , @xmath59 strongly grows at low temperatures getting the value 100 at @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath59 versus @xmath54 behavior is pointed out in fig.3(b ) for three selected temperatures .",
    "figure 3(c ) shows that by decreasing the oscillator energy an increasing number of cumulants has to be taken into account to make the thermodynamical functions convergent : this is consistent with the expectations that high energy oscillators are less sensitive to _ e - ph _ induced anharmonicity .",
    "next we turn to the computation of the equilibrium thermodynamics of the phonon subsystem in our semiclassical ssh model hence , using in ( 6 ) the external source current given in ( 3 ) .",
    "as the electron propagator depends on the bare hopping integral we set @xmath70 thus assuming a narrow band electron system .",
    "any electron path yields in principle a different cumulant contribution as pointed out in the appendix .",
    "numerical investigation shows however that convergent @xmath71 order cumulants are achieved by : i ) taking @xmath72 fourier components in the electron path expansion , ii ) setting for the coefficients @xmath73 a maximum amplitude of order 0.1 ( in units of the lattice constant ) and iii ) summing over @xmath74 electron paths .    as in the previous case ,",
    "we truncate the cumulant series in ( 6 ) by invoking the third law of thermodynamics to determine the cutoff @xmath59 in the low temperature limit and by searching numerical convergence on the first and second free energy derivatives at any finite temperature . @xmath59 does not depend on the specific electron path coefficients then , @xmath75 . again",
    ", we can start our analysis from ( 10 ) after checking that odd @xmath76 cumulants yield vanishing contributions .",
    "now however the picture of the anharmonic effects changes drastically .",
    "the _ e - ph _ coupling strongly modifies the shape of the heat capacity and free energy plots with respect to the harmonic result as it is seen in figs.4(a ) and 4(b ) respectively . above a threshold value @xmath77 ( depending on the energy oscillator here set at @xmath78 ) the heat capacity versus temperature curves",
    "show a peak whose location along the @xmath60 axis is reported on in fig.4(d ) as a function of @xmath3 . by enhancing @xmath3",
    "the height of the peak grows and the bulk of the anharmonic effects on the heat capacity is shifted towards lower @xmath60 . at @xmath79",
    "the crossover temperature is around 100k . at high",
    "@xmath60 the anharmonic corrections renormalize downwards the free energy but their effect on the heat capacity tends to decrease signalling that _ e - ph _ nonlinearities are rather to be seen in the intermediate to low temperature range .",
    "also the @xmath59 versus @xmath60 behavior is much different from the previous case ( discussed in fig.3(a ) ) : it is seen in fig.4(c ) that a few cumulant terms suffice at low temperatures even at large _ e - ph _ couplings while @xmath59 grows by increasing @xmath60 for any @xmath3 .",
    "then , @xmath80 does not necessarily provide a measure of the degree of _ e - ph _ anharmonicity as revealed by the heat capacity behavior . at room temperature",
    "we find @xmath81 as the maximum value for the range of @xmath3 s here considered with a low energy oscillator .",
    "however , by taking @xmath82 , @xmath59 drops ( as shown in fig.4(c ) ) attaining the value 6 at around room temperature for @xmath83 .",
    "this would suggest that also in the ssh model high energy phonons are expected to be less anharmonic .",
    "this idea is confirmed by looking at fig.4(d ) where the crossover temperature in the oscillator heat capacity curves is reported on , at fixed @xmath3 , versus @xmath44 .",
    "the heat capacity peak shows up at @xmath84 and its temperature location is shifted downwards by decreasing the phonon energy whereas , at larger energies , the heat capacity has a positive derivative in the whole range of temperatures .",
    "finally we note that recent numerical studies of a classical one dimensional anharmonic model undergoing a peierls instability @xcite also find a specific heat peak as a signature of anharmonicity .",
    "we have studied the equilibrium thermodynamics of an electron - phonon system looking in particular at the anharmonic effects produced by the electronic subsystem on the phonon oscillators .",
    "the path integral formalism permits to analyse the _ e - ph _ non linearities as a function of the source current ( peculiar of the hamiltonian model ) which disturbs the harmonic oscillator .",
    "the phonon partition function has been expanded in @xmath71 order cumulant series and , at any temperature , we have determined the cutoff @xmath59 that makes first and second free energy derivatives convergent . in the zero temperature limit",
    "the constraint imposed by the third law of thermodynamics has been fulfilled . rather than being a unique measure of _ e - ph _",
    "anharmonicity @xmath80 turns out to be a model dependent function whose values may vary considerably according to the physical quantities one decides to sample . as a general trend we find however that , at fixed @xmath60 and _ e - ph _ coupling , higher energy oscillators are more stable and require a lower @xmath59 for the computation of their thermodynamical properties .",
    "we have first considered the case of a source current proportional to the time averaged electron path and analytically derived the cumulant expansion for the phonon partition function .",
    "this current induces a slope preserving shift in the phonon free energy versus temperature hence , the heat capacity does not show any correction with respect to the harmonic result in spite of the high number of anharmonic terms which appear in the cumulant series .    turning to the source current peculiar of the time dependent , one dimensional , semiclassical su - schrieffer - heeger model we find a striking evidence of _ e - ph _ anharmonicity in the constant volume heat capacity of a single oscillator . as a main feature the heat capacity exhibits a peak whose",
    "height and location on the @xmath60 axis varies with the strength of the _ e - ph _ coupling and the energy of the oscillator : while strong couplings shift the main body of the anharmonic effects towards low @xmath60 , high energy phonons prove to be less affected by _ e - ph _ corrections .",
    "let s assume a source current @xmath85 as the disturbing term for the oscillator field , @xmath3 being the _ e - ph _ coupling and @xmath10 being the electron path . then the _ k - th _ order cumulant term contributing to the @xmath40 perturbed phonon partition function is given by            @xmath90 \\ , \\nonumber \\\\",
