    "the kondo effect basically involves a localized magnetic impurity embedded in a bulk metal and antiferromagnetically coupled to conduction electrons .",
    "this strong - correlation phenomenon occurring in a variety of different systems and settings@xcite really acts as a paradigm in the field of strongly - correlated systems .",
    "a fascinating ground state where the impurity is screened by a cloud of heavy electrons emerges at low temperatures.@xcite even though the one - impurity kondo effect is well understood@xcite the practical situation of kondo alloys with a finite concentration of impurities such as heavy fermion compounds is more subtle@xcite and especially when approaching a quantum critical point.@xcite at the heart of the central problem in those kondo heavy fermion systems is the question how local moments behave itinerantly and in particular how the conduction electrons are counted in the presence of local spins .",
    "an attempt to study this question has been _",
    "e.g. _ performed in refs . . here",
    ", we are rather concerned by the ferromagnetic region of the kondo coupling . of interest to us is the ferromagnetic kondo lattice model in the hole - rich region .",
    "this model can be of relevance for a plethora of electron systems dominated by hund s rule , such as oxide manganites@xcite or the heavy fermion metal liv@xmath0o@xmath1.@xcite    our starting point is the one - dimensional ( 1d ) model , @xmath2 where @xmath3 creates a conduction electron of spin @xmath4 at the site @xmath5 and @xmath6 depicts the spin @xmath7 local moments ; the conduction band embodies a fermi gas .",
    "the conduction electrons and the localized spins are coupled through a ferromagnetic kondo coupling or hund s coupling and therefore @xmath8 .",
    "the `` core '' spins are also directly coupled through an antiferromagnetic interaction @xmath9 .",
    "where the singlet states enter in a low density limit and weak antiferromagnetism between local moments still dominates.,width=328,height=124 ]    -0.6 cm    for @xmath10 , as a reminiscence of the single - impurity case , the ferromagnetic kondo coupling fatally scales to very weak couplings at low temperatures and thus can be ignored ; the conduction electrons essentially decouple from the spin array that forms a spin liquid with short - range magnetism due to reduced dimensionality.@xcite    in contrast , in the large @xmath11 limit , the conduction electron spins adiabatically follow the core spins . as elucidated by anderson and hasegawa,@xcite",
    "this induces a ferromagnetic correlation @xmath12 $ ] between neighbouring spins in order to facilitate coherent propagation .",
    "this phenomenon , known as the double exchange mechanism , leads to a ferromagnetic ground state at intermediate densities if we assume reasonable values of @xmath9 ( for @xmath13 , following the monte carlo results of ref .",
    "this precisely means @xmath14 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the forced alignment also removes a large part of the hilbert space since at each site , doubly - occupied and the antiparallel singly - occupied states are both projected out . more precisely , an electron combines with the core spin to form two manifolds of total spin @xmath15 ( singlet states ) and @xmath16 ( triplet states ) . in the large @xmath17 realm ,",
    "singlet states are thus completely projected out as shown in fig .",
    "1 . moreover , in the ferromagnetic regime , the system can be identified as an ideal metal since triplets can propagate coherently , _",
    "i.e. _ , still behave as free fermions.@xcite    below , we are concerned by thermodynamic properties of conduction electrons in the intermediate region @xmath18 where the double exchange becomes less important@xcite producing @xmath19 and thus a residual antiferromagnetic exchange @xmath20 but nevertheless singlet states enter in a low - density regime as a result of the strong hund s coupling . in particular ,",
    "one interesting question arises : does the presence of heavy singlets in low density and of the short - range antiferromagnetism in the spin array will hinder the coherent propagation of triplet states in the system and produce a _ heavy electron ground state _ ?",
    "this is precisely the question addressed below that might be relevant to understand the heavy electron ground state in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "let us mention that the case where the singlet states are completely projected out is beyond the scope of this paper and we will not discuss the ferromagnetic phase . note that other scenarios involving an inter - site kondo effect ( that might become important for larger hund s couplings ) have been explored in the context of liv@xmath0o@xmath1.@xcite",
    "again , the model under investigation is the hamiltonian ( 1 ) in the intermediate realm where @xmath18 and @xmath19 such that the core spins are coupled through a residual weak antiferromagnetic interaction @xmath20 and form a low - dimensional spin liquid embodied by spin-1/2 ( spinon ) excitations .",
    "we use the continuum limit and linearize the dispersion of the conduction electrons ; thus , @xmath21 ( a being the lattice spacing ) and @xmath22 is separated in left ( - ) movers @xmath23 and right ( + ) movers @xmath24 .",
    "the spins @xmath25 are related to the localized electrons via @xmath26 .",
    "we exploit the bosonization procedure for localized electrons @xmath27:@xcite @xmath28/\\sqrt{2\\pi a}.\\ ] ] here , @xmath29 refers to the direction of propagation ( right ( + ) or left ( - ) ) , @xmath30 denotes the charge part and the spin ( spinon ) operator is precisely defined as in our ref .",
    "@xmath31.\\ ] ] @xmath32 is related to the spin of a spinon via @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "now , we can use the fact that charge fluctuations in the spin array are suppressed@xcite @xmath36 as well as@xcite @xmath37^{1/2}$ ] such that @xmath38 only depends on spinon operators . note that deconfined spin 1/2 excitations have also been discussed in higher dimensions for certain classes of quantum critical magnets involving frustrated spin arrays@xcite as well as for the kondo lattice close to quantum criticality.@xcite in the context of liv@xmath0o@xmath1",
    "the lattice is definitely frustrated ensuring the absence of any antiferromagnetic order .",
    "moreover , short - range antiferromagnetism has been observed suggesting the formation of a spin - liquid state in the spin array.@xcite    at this step , we apply the standard spin decomposition @xmath39 where @xmath40^{1/2}$ ] embodies the @xmath41 _ ferromagnetic _ component whereas @xmath42 and @xmath43 stand for the _ staggered _ magnetizations .",
    "assuming incommensurate filling for the conduction band , hence we obtain @xmath44 where @xmath45 includes the kinetic energy of the conduction electrons as well the heisenberg interaction between local moments yielding a usual plasmon form as a function of @xmath46 and @xmath47,@xcite and @xmath48 depicts the dimensionless hund s coupling .",
    "in particular , it is well established that the staggered magnetization of the local moments decouple from the conduction band at relatively ( short ) length scales @xmath49 with @xmath50 being the fermi momentum of the conduction band.@xcite    again , when @xmath51 , under renormalization group ( rg ) flow , the ferromagnetic kondo coupling would irrefutably flow to weak couplings@xcite and the conduction band would essentially decouple from the spin array .",
    "now , to judiciously tackle the non - perturbative region @xmath18 and @xmath52 where perturbative rg arguments cease to be valid , we resort to eq .",

    "solvable limit _ analogous to the toulouse limit for the single - impurity case@xcite that explicitly takes into account the singlet - triplet basis .",
    "the hund s coupling takes the form @xmath59 we can introduce composite fermionic objects by resorting to the precious `` gauge '' transformation @xmath60 and the electron operators @xmath61 commute with the spinon operators . exploiting the equality @xmath62 , we check that the @xmath63-objects are fermions : @xmath64 .",
    "additionally , @xmath65 .",
    "after permuting @xmath66 , since the spin @xmath38 remains immobile , this explicitly produces the re - definitions @xmath67 and @xmath68 . hence , we can verify the fermionic exchange statistics @xmath69 .",
    "the hund s coupling then becomes @xmath70 we have decomposed the hund s ( kondo ) coupling @xmath71 into an ising @xmath72 and a transverse part @xmath73 .",
    "moreover , by linearizing the spectrum of the conduction electrons around the fermi points , @xmath74 turns into @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the fermi velocity .",
    "_ we identify a solvable point @xmath77_. indeed , for @xmath77 , we can easily reveal the singlet - triplet basis by resorting to the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations , @xmath78 ( triplets ) and @xmath79 ( singlets ) .",
    "more precisely , we get @xmath80 the hamiltonian ( 10 ) suggests the following interpretation : @xmath81 refers to an itinerant electron with the lowest energy , _",
    "i.e. _ , forming a _ triplet _ state with the local moment at the same site ( that is in agreement with the strong @xmath82 and @xmath83 limit ) whereas @xmath84 refers to an electron forming a _ singlet _ state with the local moment at the same site .",
    "a singlet costs a supplementary energy @xmath85 as it should be because this requires the spin flip of a conduction electron or of a local moment .",
    "note , the weak magnetism of the spin array is preserved through @xmath86 as it should be for ferromagnetic kondo couplings .",
    "note also that the @xmath87 operators do not have a simple interpretation due to the coupling term @xmath88 ; however , it is essential to apply the gauge transformation of eq .",
    "( 7 ) to reveal the ( physical ) singlet - triplet basis .",
    "eq . ( 10 ) ensures the following fermi wave vectors : @xmath89 having in mind liv@xmath0o@xmath1 , we envision the situation of a quarter - filled band .",
    "we infer the renormalized ( fermi ) velocities @xmath90 ^ 2)^{1/2}$ ] . for @xmath91",
    ", we can check that the hund s coupling has practically no effect , @xmath92 .",
    "in contrast , for extremely large hund s couplings such that @xmath93 $ ] the singlet band becomes completely depopulated and @xmath94 . we consider the intermediate coupling region where singlets occur in low density : @xmath95 .",
    "let us first discuss thermodynamic properties of the whole system at the solvable limit @xmath77 where itinerant electrons and spinons _ essentially _ decouple ; see eq .",
    "temperature is assumed to be smaller than @xmath96 .",
    "first , through @xmath86 the curie - weiss susceptibility of the spin array will saturate to @xmath97 and the specific heat of the spin array reads @xmath98.@xcite here , @xmath99 embodies the velocity of the spinons .",

    "below , we will thus refer to @xmath101 as the _ total _ specific heat at @xmath77 with @xmath102 .",
    "we can evaluate the electronic part of the magnetic susceptibility by adding a term in the hamiltonian ( 10 ) : @xmath103 to align itinerant electron spins along the magnetic field direction this inevitably requires some spin - flip processes , _",
    "i.e. _ , some triplet - singlet transitions and vice - versa . to compute the free energy contribution to second order in @xmath104 , @xmath105",
