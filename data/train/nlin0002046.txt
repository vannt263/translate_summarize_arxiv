    "perceptual alternation phenomena of ambiguous figures have been studied for a long time .",
    "figure - ground , perspective ( depth ) and semantic ambiguities are well known ( as an overview , for example , see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "actually , when we view the necker cube which is a classic example of perspective alternation , a part of the figure is perceived either as front or back of a cube and our perception switches between the two different interpretations as shown in fig.1 . in this circumstance the external stimulus is kept constant , but perception undergoes involuntary and random - like change .",
    "the measurements have been quantified in psychophysical experiments and it becomes evident that the times between such changes are approximately gamma distributed @xcite .",
    "theoretical model approaches to explaining the facts have been made mainly from three situations based on the synergetics @xcite , the bsb ( brain - state - in - a - box ) neural network model @xcite , and the pdp ( parallel distributed processing ) schema model @xcite .",
    "common to these approaches is that top - down designs are applied so that the model can be manipulable by a few parameters and upon this basis fluctuating sources are brought in .",
    "the major interests seem to be not in the relation between the whole function and its element ( neuron ) , but in the model building at the phenomenological level .    until now",
    "diverse types of chaos have been confirmed at several hierarchical levels in the real neural systems from single cells to cortical networks ( e.g.  ionic channels , spike trains from cells , eeg ) @xcite .",
    "this suggests that artificial neural networks based on the mcculloch - pitts neuron model @xcite should be re - examined and re - developed .",
    "chaos may play an essential role in the extended frame of the hopfield neural network @xcite beyond the only equilibrium point attractors . to make this point clear , following the model of chaotic neural network @xcite , the dynamic learning and retrieving features of the associative memory have been studied @xcite . in this paper , we present a perception model of ambiguous patterns based on the chaotic neural network from the viewpoint of bottom - up approach @xcite , aiming at the functioning of chaos in dynamic perceptual processes .",
    "the chaotic neural network ( cnn ) composed of n chaotic neurons is described as @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3  :  output of neuron @xmath4  :  synaptic weight from neuron @xmath5 to neuron @xmath6  :  threshold of neuron @xmath7 )  :  decay factor for the feedback(refractoriness ) @xmath8  :  refractory scaling parameter ,  @xmath9  :  output function defined by @xmath10 with the steepness parameter @xmath11 .",
    "owing to the exponentially decaying form of the past influence ,  eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) can be reduced to @xmath12 where @xmath13 is temporally constant @xmath14 .",
    "all neurons are updated in parallel , that is , synchronously .",
    "the network corresponds to the conventional discrete - time hopfield network : @xmath15 when @xmath16  ( hopfield network point ( hnp ) ) .",
    "the asymptotical stability and chaos in discrete - time neural networks are theoretically investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite .    under external stimuli , eq.(1 )",
    "is influenced as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the effective term by external stimuli .",
    "this is a simple and unartificial incorporation of stimuli as the changes of neural active potentials .",
    "the two competitive interpretations are embedded in the network as minima of the energy map : @xmath19 at hnp .",
    "this is done by using a iterative perception learning rule for @xmath20 patterns @xmath21 in the form : @xmath22 with @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the unit step function .",
    "the learning mode is separated from the performance mode by eq.(7 ) .",
    "the conceptual picture of our model is shown in fig.2 . under the external stimulus @xmath26 ,",
    "chaotic activities arise on the neural network and cause the transitions between stable states of hnp .",
    "this situation corresponds to the dynamic multistable perception .",
    "note that @xmath27 turns off learning for overlearned patterns .",
    "this will be empirically shown in the next section to have dynamics characteristic of a chaotic dynamical system .",
    "to carry out computational experiments , we use the @xmath28 non - orthogonal 10 random patterns @xmath29 as a set of ambiguous figure stimuli : @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 is the strength factor of stimulation . for each of them ,",
    "two interpretation patterns @xmath32 and @xmath33 are prepared by changing 15 white ( @xmath34 ) pixels to black ( @xmath35 ) ones which do not overlap between @xmath36 and @xmath37 as shown by shaded and dotted in fig.3 , and are memorized following the above learning rule @xmath38 .",
    "figure 4 shows a time series evolution of cnn @xmath39 under the stimulus @xmath40 . here , @xmath41    and",
    "is called the overlap of the network state @xmath42 and the interpretation pattern @xmath43 . a switching phenomenon between @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) and @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) can be observed .",
    "bursts of switching are interspersed with prolonged periods during which @xmath42 trembles near @xmath43 or @xmath45 . evaluating the maximum lyapunov exponent @xcite to be positive ( @xmath47 ) , we find that the network is dynamically in chaos . in the cases",
    "@xmath48 , such switching phenomena do not arise .    from the @xmath49 iteration data ( until @xmath50 ) of fig.4",
    ", we get 1257 events staying near one of the two interpretations , @xmath45 .",
    "as can be seen from fig.5 magnified for t - axis , they have various persistent durations @xmath51 which seem to have a random time course by the return map in @xmath52 shown in fig.6 . from the evaluation of the autocorrelation function for @xmath53 , @xmath54 ( here ,",
    "@xmath55 means an average over time ) , we get @xmath56 against @xmath57 .",
    "this suggests successive durations @xmath53 are independent .",
    "the frequency of occurrence of @xmath58 is plotted for 1257 events in fig.7 .",
    "the distribution is well fitted by gamma distribution    @xmath59    with @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the euler - gamma function .",
    "@xmath62 is the normalized duration @xmath63 and here 15 step interval is applied to determine the relative frequencies .",
    "the results are in good agreement with the characteristics of psychophysical experiments @xcite .",
    "similar results to the above example are obtained in the appropriate parameter regions where the network may induce chaotic activities under external stimuli .",
    "it is found that aperiodic spontaneous switching does not necessitate some stochastic description as in the synergetic model @xcite .",
    "these results can not be easily explained through the use of a standard hopfield network with a stochastic fluctuation forcing function .",
    "we look into the case that the stochastic fluctuation @xmath64 is attached to eq.(6 ) of hnp together with the external stimulus @xmath26 :    @xmath65    where @xmath66 using this equation in the same framework , we examined many cases with different values of the noise strength @xmath67 , but could nt find successive alternation phenomena .",
    "figure 8 is a typical result in @xmath68 and is far from the realization of sudden perceptual changes .",
    "in such a simple scheme , the noise does not drive a quick motion of @xmath42 for the energy barrier . in fig.9",
    "the frequency of occurrence @xmath58 is plotted for 1387 events obtained until @xmath50 .",
    "the distribution becomes the exponential - like , not gamma distribution .",
    "we have shown that the neural chaos leads to perceptual alternations as responses to ambiguous stimuli in the chaotic neural network .",
    "its emergence is based on the simple process in a realistic bottom - up framework . in the same stage",
    ", similar results can not be obtained by the stochastic activity . in order to compare the simulation results with experimental ones in a concrete form , there remain problems which are to analyze the relationship between the iteration ( step ) time and the visual real time , and to study the switching dependence on the cube s orientation or size .    finally , our demonstration suggests functional usefulness of the chaotic activity in perceptual systems even at higher cognitive levels .",
    "the perceptual alternation appears to be an inherent feature built in the chaotic neuron assembly .",
    "it may be interesting to study the brain with the experimental technique ( e.g. , fmri ) under the circumstance where the perceptual alternation is running .",
