    "absorption line data are taken from the vienna atomic line database    ` http://vald.astro.univie.ac.at/~vald/php/vald.php `    . using the effective temperature and surface gravity determined from fitting the balmer lines we calculate grids of synthetic spectra for each element of interest .",
    "the grids cover a range of abundances typically from log[@xmath19(z)/@xmath19(h)]= @xmath03.0 to @xmath07.0 in steps of 0.5 dex .",
    "we then determine the abundance of each element by fitting the various observed lines using a similar method to that described in @xcite .",
    "briefly , this is done by minimizing the value of @xmath20@xmath21 which is taken to be the sum of the difference between the normalized observed and model fluxes over the frequency range of interest with all frequency points being given an equal weight .",

    "the revised abundances quoted in @xcite are also in agreement with our own , except for mg which is less abundant by @xmath230.3 dex due to the @xcite inclusion of pressure broadening and non - local thermodynamic equilibrium effects .",

    "it is noted that fits to the fe lines assuming a t@xmath12 of 21,000 k yield an fe abundance consistent with that reported in @xcite .",
    "new elements discovered in the hires data are chromium identified from two cr  ii lines and manganese identified from one mn  ii line ( figure [ figlines ] ) .",
    "aluminum may potentially be present in the hires data as well ( figure [ figlines ] ) , however the s / n is marginal so we report al only as an upper limit ( table [ tab1931 ] ) .",
    "abundances for all elements identified to date in the atmosphere of galex1931 are reported in table [ tab1931 ] as well as upper limits for other elements of interest ( see section [ secdisc ] ) .",
    "it is noted that the galex nuv and fuv measurements appear discrepant with the white dwarf parameters derived above .",
    "we find that the model can be brought into agreement with the data by reddening the white dwarf with the @xcite extinction curve assuming e(b@xmath0v)= 0.03 and interstellar reddening .",
    "however , such reddening places the model at the limit of the 3@xmath24 uncertainties quoted for the optical photometry .",
    "it is likely that the true color excess toward galex1931 is less than 0.03 and that some combination of reddening and metal line blanketing ( from elements detected and as of yet undetected ) in the uv - spectrum of galex1931 are responsible for the depressed galex measurements relative to the model .",

    "* ) suggests that the 2mass measurements for galex1931 suffer from contamination in the photometric apertures and/or annuli used to calculate the sky background and hence are inaccurate .",
    "looking at figure [ figims ] , one can identify at least two sources that may have fallen within the 2mass apertures in this crowded field near the galactic plane .",
    "similarly , the wise data reported in @xcite could have been contaminated by these same sources . due to",
    "the discrepancy between the wise data and the high angular resolution data presented herein , we do not include the wise data in our analysis .",
    "the isaac j@xmath8- and h - band measurements agree to within their errors with the white dwarf photospheric model while the k@xmath8-band measurement confirms the upward slope of the fire spectrum demonstrating excess emission that begins at wavelengths near 2 @xmath2 m .",
    "this result challenges the conclusions of @xcite whose suggestion of an l5-type dwarf companion relied on the h@xmath0k@xmath8 color of the 2mass photometry .",
    "figure [ fignobds ] illustrates that the excess emission implied by the contaminated 2mass photometry is potentially consistent with an l - type companion .",
    "the isaac photometry , which is of higher fidelity , clearly indicates that a roughly mid l - type object can not be the cause of the excess infrared emission .",
    "later - type companions are ruled out by the isaac photometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and fire spectra : the spectra smoothly connect the isaac j@xmath8hk@xmath8 data points and show no evidence for the expected spectral features arising from a sub - stellar companion @xcite .",
    "given the volume of previous results linking white dwarf metal pollution and dusty disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it seems reasonable to conclude that the observed excess infrared emission detected toward galex1931 emanates from a disk that orbits ( and is accreted by ) the white dwarf . a model for the photospheric emission of galex1931",
    "is computed with the parameters described in section [ secspec ] and including the detected metals with abundances as listed in table [ tab1931 ] . to fit the observed near - infrared spectra and photometry",
    ", we add to the white dwarf model an optically thick , flat dust disk @xcite with an inner disk temperature ( t@xmath26 ) of 1400 k , outer disk temperature ( t@xmath27 ) of 1200 k , and an inclination angle ( @xmath28 ) of 70@xmath29 ( where @xmath28 = 90@xmath29 is edge on to our line of sight ) . in this fit",
    "we set r@xmath15/d = 5.3@xmath110@xmath30 ( see section [ secspec ] ) .",
    "this disk and star model is shown in figure [ fig1931sed ] and reproduces well the observed data .",
    "it is noted that the fit presented here is not unique and that the temperature of the outer region of galex1931 s disk is weakly constrained by the present data .",
    "for the case of optically thick , flat dust disks equation 1 from @xcite can be used to determine at what radial distance from a white dwarf dust particles of certain temperatures reside .",
    "the inner disk temperature of 1400 k suggests particles residing as close as 25 r@xmath31 for a flat disk geometry .",
    "a temperature of 1400 k is close to the sublimation temperature for some silicates , the expected mineralogical constituent of galex1931 s dusty disk given the stoichiometry of other white dwarf disks @xcite and the metals detected in its atmosphere ( table [ tab1931 ] ) .",
    "thus , the modeled inner disk radius could be physically motivated by sublimation of grains that will eventually be accreted by galex1931 .",
    "our data set is not comprehensive enough to rule out a warped disk morphology which could increase the inner disk radius while still reproducing the observed near - infrared excess emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it is noted that if a flat dust disk geometry accurately describes the distribution of galex1931 s orbiting debris , then the disk is likely narrow as flat dust disk models with t@xmath27@xmath32 1000 k ( r@xmath27@xmath32 40 r@xmath15 ) are not consistent with the data .",
    "such a result suggests galex1931 may host a narrow distribution of disk material ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "observations at longer wavelengths should solidify which of the above interpretations are valid .    in their red echelle spectra of galex1931",
    ", @xcite do not identify double - peaked emission lines from the ca  ii infrared triplet indicative of an orbiting gaseous disk @xcite .",
    "modeling and results presented by @xcite and @xcite suggest that gas disks around white dwarfs are fed by an influx of rocky objects into the roche limit of a white dwarf star .",
    "the absence of such emission lines and hence an obvious gas disk orbiting galex1931 are suggestive of its dust disk originating in the tidal shredding of one large rocky object .",
    "modeling of the ultraviolet through infrared spectral energy distribution of galex1931 provides strong evidence that an orbiting dusty circumstellar disk emits the detected excess infrared emission . following earlier results",
    ", we assume that this dusty disk has its origin in the tidal disruption of a rocky object that breached galex1931 s roche limit . the ultimate fate of such material is to be accreted by the white dwarf star . under this assumption",
    "we can deduce the bulk elemental composition of such an object from the metal abundances reported in table [ tab1931 ] . to properly convert the measured abundances to the abundances at the time of accretion we must include the effects of diffusion , radiative levitation , and the relevant accretion phase ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the presence of a disk orbiting galex1931 and the extremely short elemental diffusion constants ( table [ tab1931 ] ) imply that we are observing elemental abundances during the steady - state accretion phase . in this phase , accretion of metals has reached an equilibrium with the rate at which these metals diffuse out of the white dwarf s photosphere .",
    "the work of @xcite suggests that for accretion rates @xmath910@xmath33 g s@xmath4 the effects of radiative levitation are negligible @xmath0 all measured accretion rates and upper limits exceed this threshold value ( table [ tab1931 ] ) and hence we ignore radiative levitation .",
    "thus , we determine the accreted abundance ratios by employing equation 16 from @xcite and the diffusion constants of @xcite computed specifically for the galex1931 parameters determined in section [ secspec ] ( d. koester 2010 , private communication ) .",
    "accreted abundances relative to fe are reported in table [ tab1931 ] .",
    "we desire to make a rough estimate of the mass accreted to date onto galex1931 .",
    "accretion rates for each element are computed under the assumption that material accretes in the steady - state ; these values are reported in table [ tab1931 ] . the total accretion rate summed over all elements",
    "is @xmath53.9 @xmath1 10@xmath34 g s@xmath4 .",
    "an estimate of how long galex1931 has been accreting from its dusty disk comes from the percentage of da stars with effective temperatures similar to galex1931 and atmospheric pollution .",
    "it is assumed that this percentage is linked to the length of time in which such da white dwarf stars would show metal pollution and hence be polluted from a surrounding disk of material . from @xcite and @xcite we find that 5 out of 116 or 4.31% of da white dwarfs within the temperature range of 19,500 k @xmath7 t@xmath12 @xmath7 25,000 k are polluted with metals ( including galex1931 ) . taking the cooling time of a white dwarf in the above t@xmath12 range to be equal to that of galex1931 ( 30 myr , see section [ secspec ] ) , and assuming all white dwarfs accrete from a disk during this interval , it is determined that the disk lifetime for galex1931 is 1.3 myr .",
    "assuming galex1931 has been accreting at a constant rate for @xmath51 myr , we estimate that @xmath52 @xmath1 10@xmath35 g of material has accreted onto the white dwarf star .",
    "this is close to the second most massive asteroid in our solar system , vesta ( @xmath233 @xmath1 10@xmath35 g ) .",
    "it is noted that numerous assumptions are included in this estimate and that it could increase or decrease significantly and that the estimate does not include the mass remaining in the disk .",
    "following @xcite , we attempt to balance the accreted oxygen abundances under the expectation that all oxygen was contained in rocky oxygenated minerals ( e.g. , mgo , al@xmath36o@xmath37 , sio@xmath36 , cao , tio@xmath36 , cr@xmath36o@xmath37 , mno , feo , fe@xmath36o@xmath37 , and nio ) and water ( h@xmath36o ; see * ? ? ? * for a discussion of water survival in rocky objects during post - main sequence evolution ) .",
    "the criterion that needs to be met is equation 3 of @xcite :    @xmath38    where element @xmath39 is contained in molecule @xmath40o@xmath41 . in this equation",
    "one must consider only hydrogen accreted from the parent body ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "we find that the oxygen accreting onto galex1931 can be accounted for almost entirely by inclusion in rocky minerals .",
    "there is , however , the ambiguity of how fe was partitioned in the parent body that accreted onto galex1931 . in our model fe could have been contained in any one of metallic fe , feo , or fe@xmath36o@xmath37 ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "depending on how we divide fe into these three states , there can be anything from a significant deficit in the oxygen balance ( @xmath43 = 0.58 instead of 1.0 , indicating too much oxygen for the number of heavier element atoms ) to a significant overestimate of rocky minerals ( @xmath43 = 1.33 instead of 1.0 , indicating too little oxygen for the number of heavier element atoms ) .",
    "assuming as did @xcite that half of the fe is in the form of metallic fe and half in the form of feo , we arrive at a value of @xmath43=0.83 . with this value",
    "we constrain the amount of water present in the object that accreted onto galex1931 to be @xmath44@xmath70.2 or @xmath71% of the mass of the parent body .",
    "it is noted that use of the lower mg abundance derived by @xcite would result in a more water - rich body .",
    "thus it appears as though the material accreting onto galex1931 is very likely to have originated in rocky minerals and is likely to be only a small percentage of water by mass .",
    "examination of the bulk elemental composition of the material that is accreted by galex1931 can potentially yield insight into the evolutionary processes that affect terrestrial - like planets during the late stages of stellar evolution . in figure [ figwdpolfe ]",
    "we plot the elemental abundances relative to fe for three white dwarfs : gd 362 @xcite , gd 40 @xcite , and galex1931 .",
    "we normalize each of these relative abundance measurements ( at the time of accretion for each object ) to elemental abundances relative to fe for ci chondrites ( see table [ tab1931 ] and * ? ? ?",
    "ci chondrites are chosen as these objects have some of the best - determined bulk compositions of any object in our solar system .",
    "ci chondrites have near - solar compositions and thus represent primitive rocks that likely formed directly from the solar nebula ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . under the assumption that primitive rocks are similar in all planetary systems , we seek to probe whether or not the parent body being accreted by galex1931 has undergone significant processing by comparing the galex1931 measured abundances to ci chondrite abundances .",
    "to further place the white dwarf measurements into context , we overplot the bulk elemental composition of earth as extracted from the measurements of @xcite and the compilation of @xcite .    most striking in figure [ figwdpolfe ] is the rough agreement of the abundances of all elements for the three white dwarfs with the bulk earth , especially the depletion of the volatiles c and o relative to what would be expected from the more primitive ci chondrites . next is the good agreement between transition metal abundances ( mn , cr , fe , and ni ) for the accreted objects and the bulk earth .",
    "the obvious discrepancies are with si and mg and the refractories ca and ti .",
    "assuming the parent bodies that are accreted by each white dwarf started close to earth - like in bulk elemental composition ( a risky assumption , but the best that can be made at present ) , significant deficits of si and varying degrees of deficient mg suggest crustal and mantle loss .",
    "this result suggests that each white dwarf has accreted objects massive enough to experience differentiation .",
    "that is , the atoms layered themselves in the parent body by mass ( with the heaviest atoms at the parent body s core ) .",
    "such a result indicates that the parent bodies now being accreted by each white dwarf were indeed massive bodies and perhaps even full - fledged planets .",
    "ca , ti , and al abundances could potentially bear the signature of a particular crust and mantle loss mechanism .",
    "@xcite compared the accreted abundances for gd 40 to a model developed by @xcite that described the evolution of a rocky planetary body when it is exposed to intense radiation .",
    "the predictions of this model are in good agreement with the parent body abundances for the object accreted by gd 40 @xcite .",
    "such a model could potentially provide a reasonable explanation for the parent body composition of the object accreted by gd 362 as it too shows the characteristic enhancement of ca and ti predicted in the @xcite model , although the mantle loss appears to be more severe as per the significant mg deficiency ( figure [ figwdpolfe ] ) .",
    "to explain the results for galex1931 requires either additional evolutionary processes or a different evolutionary path that results in crust and mantle loss without the enhancement of ca and ti .",
    "indeed , galex1931 shows a significant @xmath45 of ca , ti , and al relative to the earth and ci chondrites ( see figure [ figwdpolfe ] ) .    to explain the distinctive elemental mixture accreting onto galex1931 we propose a scenario in which the dominant evolutionary mechanism acting on the parent body was interaction with the host star stellar wind .",
    "after irradiation by the luminous host star while on the asymptoptic giant branch ( agb ) , interaction with the agb ejecta seems a likely choice for a rocky planet mass loss mechanism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in such a scenario the rocky planet is essentially sanded down by the agb wind , losing first its crust then mantle depending on the severity of the planet s interaction with the stellar wind .",
    "we estimate to first order the relative abundances of such an object after crustal and mantle stripping . we begin with the assumption that the object started with the same composition as the bulk earth and the same crust and mantle abundances as the earth @xcite .",
    "also inherent is the assumption that the parent body s tidally shredded remnants are well mixed in the disk .",
    "we remove varying fractions of the crust , then upper mantle , and then lower mantle .",
    "after this removal step , the bulk abundances of the object are recomputed relative to fe . experimentation with varying degrees of crust and mantle",
    "removal suggests that the best match between the simple stripping model and the galex1931 abundances shown in figure [ figwdpolfe ] is obtained after stripping the entire crust and upper mantle and half of the lower mantle .",
    "the simple model provides good agreement with the measurements , with the exception of aluminum .",
    "these results suggest that `` wind stripping '' of the outer layers of an earth - like planet is a viable mode to produce the observed parent body abundances in at least some white dwarfs and thus that interaction with the agb stellar wind is likely an important process in a terrestrial planet s final evolutionary phase .",
    "exploration of the relevant physics in the wind stripping process can further develop the simple model laid out above .",
    "we have carried out a comprehensive suite of observations aimed at characterizing galex1931 s infrared excess and atmospheric pollution .",
    "our broad data set allows us to identify the excess infrared emission detected toward galex1931 as emanating from an orbiting dusty debris disk .",
    "analysis of the heavy metals detected in galex1931 s atmosphere suggests that it is accreting the remnants of a differentiated @xmath0 and hence massive @xmath0 rocky body .",
    "assuming the object being accreted by galex1931 started out roughly earth - like in composition , comparison of the distinctive bulk elemental composition of this terrestrial - like planet to predictions from a simple wind - stripping model suggests that the planet s outer layers were removed before the planet was accreted by the white dwarf star .",
    "a likely culprit for such stripping is interaction between the planet and its host star s dense stellar wind while the star progresses through the asymptoptic giant branch .",
