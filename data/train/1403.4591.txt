    "while observational results , including recent ones from the _ planck _ mission @xcite and from bicep2 @xcite , continue to strongly support inflation as the origin of cosmic structure , it remains an open issue whether the observed perturbations arise from fluctuations in the field driving inflation or from a different degree of freedom .",
    "a particular example of the latter class is the curvaton model @xcite , and there have been several reports on the status of those models in the light of _ planck _ satellite results @xcite . in this work",
    "we carry out an analysis of the simplest curvaton model @xcite , aiming at an exhaustive study of parameter space while minimizing the set of usual assumptions .",
    "our analysis is principally analytical .",
    "we consider wide regimes of relative inflaton / curvaton contribution to the curvature perturbation and energy densities .",
    "we extend the existing literature in several directions .",
    "we impose simultaneous constraints from the full set of observables in the model parameter space .",
    "we provide a detailed modelling of the number of @xmath0-foldings corresponding to observable scales  the so - called ` pivot ' scale @xcite  and allow it to respond to the change in inflationary energy scale in different parts of parameter space .",
    "we include the effect of the curvaton mass on perturbations generated via the curvaton , and we consider the region of parameter space where the curvaton may itself drive a second period of inflation .    after ensuring that the accurately - observed perturbation amplitude is reproduced , and once a reheating model is selected , the model reduces to three parameters which can be taken as the masses of the inflaton and curvaton and the value of the curvaton when the pivot scale crosses the horizon .",
    "each observable depends on at most two of these , but in different combinations .",
    "allowing for arbitrary decay times of the both fields extends the parameter space , which we parametrize by the number of matter - like @xmath0-foldings .",
    "this is due to the pressureless equation of state while a field oscillates in a quadratic potential .",
    "we do not make assumptions for the time of curvaton decay , nor the relative size of field masses . extending the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , we show that the curvaton mass can be comparable but not significantly greater than the inflaton mass .",
    "in early papers @xcite , the curvaton was assumed to be a second , light , scalar field present during inflation which    1 .   has a subdominant energy density compared to the inflaton s , while the inflaton drives inflation .",
    "2 .   is long lived ( i.e.  it decays later than the inflaton ) .",
    "3 .   [ curvaton - limit ] generates the entire primordial curvature perturbation .    in common with many other papers",
    ", we will abandon assumption 3 to include the mixed inflaton  curvaton scenario .",
    "we later discuss the case where the curvaton itself drives a short period of inflation @xcite , which is permitted by the above assumptions though this possibility is often ignored .    throughout",
    "we denote the inflaton field by @xmath1 , defined as the field which dominates the energy density when observable scales first cross outside the horizon , and the curvaton field by @xmath2 ( though in some parameter regimes the curvaton can contribute a late - stage era of inflation ) .",
    "we focus on the simplest curvaton model @xcite , featuring two massive non - interacting fields with potential @xmath3 the number of @xmath0-foldings of inflation from field values @xmath1 and @xmath2 is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the ( non - reduced ) planck mass and we have neglected the small contributions from the field values at the end of inflation .    like the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider the full range from negligible to full curvaton contribution to the total power spectrum , given by : @xmath6 we can parametrize the inflaton contribution to the total power spectrum as @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the mass that the inflaton would need if it were to give the correct amplitude of perturbations in the single - field case ; in a scenario where both field contribute this is an upper limit to the actual inflaton mass @xmath9 .",
    "it is determined by @xmath10 where * refers to the parameter value when observable scales crossed the hubble radius during inflation , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 in the single - field model .",
    "taking the observed amplitude as @xcite @xmath13 we obtain @xmath14 the ratio @xmath15 will appear throughout in our expressions as a measure of the relative contribution of the inflaton to the power spectrum in each model .",
    "the curvaton contribution to the power spectrum is determined by the ratio of curvaton to background energy density at the time the curvaton decays into the thermal bath : @xmath16 where we assumed that the inflaton has fully decayed into radiation before the curvaton decays .",
    "equation  ( [ rdec ] ) is defined so as to provide a unified expression for the curvaton perturbation in the regimes of radiation and curvaton domination at the time of decay , which is @xcite @xmath17 we use the normalization amplitude eq .",
    "( [ ampnorm ] ) to fix the ratio @xmath18 and obtain @xmath19 where henceforth @xmath20 is the @xmath0-foldings number at which the _ planck _ normalization scale @xmath21 crosses the hubble radius during inflation . evaluating eq .",
    "( [ rdec ] ) requires knowledge of the full curvaton evolution , but in practice we will only use @xmath22 via eq .",
    "( [ rdec - our ] ) as a constraint on model parameters by requiring that it takes the physically realisable values @xmath23 , in sec .  [",
    "sec : nong ] we will see that the lower bound is tightened by the constraint on local @xmath24 . we may apply this constraint even if the curvaton rolls significantly during inflation , i.e.  if @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "to impose accurate constraints we need to identify the correct number of @xmath0-foldings corresponding to the pivot scale at which observables are evaluated .",
    "the number of @xmath0-foldings that occurred after exit of the current hubble scale is given by @xcite @xmath26 where all quantities are as in single - field models .",
    "we parametrize observables as a function of the number of @xmath0-folds before the end of inflation , when the corresponding scale left the horizon , and so eq .  ( [ nhor ] )",
    "gets a correction to account for the difference between the hubble length for which it holds , and the observable scale we measure at . for the _ planck _ pivot",

    "( [ nhor ] ) combine into a term which measures the inflaton mass relative to the single - field limit ( i.e.  those terms cancel in the single - field case ) , giving @xmath31 we note that this relation sets a firm upper limit of @xmath32 as the number of @xmath0-foldings corresponding to the _ planck _ pivot scale .",
    "this seems to contradict some values quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite .    instead of parametrizing the uncertainty in associating a pivot scale by @xmath33 or @xmath20 ,",
    "we take the number of matter - like @xmath0-foldings from the end of inflation to the decay of the curvaton , denoted @xmath29 .",
    "this parameter has quite a wide plausible range , for instance @xmath34 implies instant reheating and no curvaton domination , while positive values allow for both the period of reheating after inflation and any subsequent period of curvaton domination .",
    "@xmath35 would ensure reheating at less than @xmath36 to evade overproduction of gravitinos , while @xmath37 is necessary to ensure reheating before electro - weak symmetry breaking . for our main results",
    "we take a central value of @xmath38 , which in the single - field case gives @xmath39 with a plausible modelling uncertainty of 5 in either direction , in keeping with usual estimates .",
    "if the bicep2 detection of @xmath40 is confirmed , then @xmath9 can not be significantly below the single - field value , and the relevant term in eq .",
    "( [ nstar ] ) is negligible .",
    "if we do not impose a lower bound on @xmath40 , then this term may become large , but reducing the energy scale of inflation also reduces the maximum permitted number of matter @xmath0-foldings , partially cancelling this effect . in the most extreme case , when inflation ends as late as possible and",
    "the curvaton decays shortly before nucleosynthesis , we estimate that it is possible to reduce the @xmath0-foldings further to @xmath41 .",
    "we can now make predictions for model observables : the spectral index @xmath42 , tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath40 , and non - gaussianity parameter @xmath24 .",
    "the slow - roll parameters are defined by @xmath43 if there is a single period of inflation , @xmath44 .",
    "the predicted deviation from scale invariance is @xcite , @xmath45 this expression allows for ready distinction between the contribution of the inflaton versus curvaton for each model spectrum , as a function of the inflaton mass , @xmath46 .",
    "it reduces to each of these two regimes for @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively .",
    "we further note that @xmath42 has no dependence on @xmath49 .",
    "lastly , eq .  ( [ ns ] ) has an implicit dependence on the number of @xmath0-foldings and the chosen pivot scale , which we presented in section  [ nefold ] .",
    "the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath40 is readily obtainable by @xmath50 also parametrized by the relative contribution of the inflaton mass , and without further dependence on curvaton parameters .",
    "as @xmath9 is varied from zero to @xmath8 , the prediction in the @xmath42@xmath40 plane interpolates linearly between the curvaton - dominated and inflaton - dominated regimes .",
    "+    in fig .  [ ns1 ] we show the prediction for @xmath42 given by eq .",
    "( [ ns ] ) , across two different ranges of field masses . given that @xmath42 has no dependence on @xmath49 ,",
    "the space of model parameters is two - dimensional .",
    "the right edge is the inflaton - dominated regime with @xmath51 , while the large flat area at @xmath52 is the region which is curvaton - dominated and in which the curvaton has a negligible mass .",
    "this is more or less where the 95% upper limit on @xmath42 lies according to data compilations including _ planck _ results @xcite , and hence whether these models can be considered allowed or excluded at this level is sensitive to precise data compilation choice , to the choice of parameters varied in the cosmological fits , and to the modelling of @xmath20 . for large enough @xmath53 the spectral index rises due to the curvaton mass , crossing @xmath54 at @xmath55 ( since for this inflaton potential @xmath56 ) .",
    "figure [ ns_diff ] shows the difference between the @xmath42 prediction from our method of parametrizing @xmath20 in terms of a fixed value of @xmath29 , as opposed to choosing a fixed @xmath20 .",
    "the differences are not large , but neither are they completely negligible at the current observational precision .",
    "the curvaton scenario generates non - gaussianity with the local shape , parametrized by the usual @xmath24 parameter whose value is @xcite .",
    "@xmath57 note that this expression is independent of the curvaton mass , which does not appear in the expression for @xmath22 .",
    "the non - gaussianity predictions hence also depend on only two model parameters , but in a plane orthogonal to the two that determine @xmath42 .    in the limit of @xmath58",
    "this reduces to the standard curvaton result , while the value is suppressed if the ( nearly ) gaussian inflaton perturbations also contribute to the total power spectrum ; see ref .",
    "@xcite and eq .",
    "( [ pzeta ] ) .",
    "if the perturbations from both fields are important then @xmath24 will have a slow - roll suppressed scale dependence @xcite , while in the curvaton limit where one may neglect the inflaton perturbations , @xmath24 is a constant .",
    "this difference is potentially observable @xcite .",
    "however if the curvaton has self - interactions , @xmath24 may be strongly scale dependent even in the curvaton limit @xcite .",
    "+    in fig .  [ rdec_physical ] we show the region of parameter space required by @xmath23 .",

    "[ fnl_no_constraint ] we plot @xmath24 , given by eq .",
    "( [ fnl ] ) , with the unphysical region @xmath59 cut off .",
    "the red contour marks the 95% confidence upper limit on @xmath24 from _ planck _ @xcite ; the parameter region above this line is excluded .",
    "probably the only way to rule out the quadratic curvaton model entirely , and independently of the inflationary potential ( which may be tuned in order to match any observed value of @xmath60 and @xmath40 ) , is to detect non - gaussianity of the local shape satisfying @xmath61 .",
    "this would even rule out models with two quadratic curvatons @xcite .",
    "+      figure  [ 3params ] shows the allowed region of the full three - dimensional model space , \\{@xmath62 } , obtained by combining all constraints on @xmath42 , @xmath24 and including an indicative lower bound on @xmath63 from the new bicep2 result ( the precise value chosen for this makes little difference ) . we take a fiducial value for @xmath38 in the middle panel and show the effect of varying @xmath29 away from this fiducial to the two extremes of 0 ( left ) and 40 ( right ) . because the present location of the 95% limit on @xmath42 more or less coincides with the curvaton - dominated regime s prediction , the location of this constraint is extremely sensitive to the exact value chosen , and hence depends on both the choice of data combination used and the assumptions in determining @xmath20 .",
    "inclusion of the bicep2 bound supersedes the @xmath42 constraint in the low @xmath53 curvaton regime .",
    "given these uncertainties , it would thus be premature to say that the strongly curvaton - dominated regime of the model is excluded by constraints on the spectral index alone , but very modest tightening of the constraint on @xmath42 would make this conclusion secure .",
    "by contrast , the bicep2 results act strongly against the curvaton - dominated regime throughout its parameter space .",
    "we have so far assumed that the curvaton field does not lead to a second phase of inflation after the inflaton has decayed .",
    "this was enforced by choosing @xmath64 , since @xmath65 is required in order to drive a second period of inflation .",
    "this condition does not depend on the mass of the curvaton .",
    "however , a small vev is not always a requirement to call @xmath2 a curvaton .",
    "if the curvaton mass is much smaller than the inflaton mass , then assumption 1 may hold even if the curvaton vev is as large as the inflaton s .",
    "this leads to the inflating curvaton scenario , in which the inflaton drives inflation for @xmath66 @xmath0-folds , then oscillates and decays .",
    "the curvaton is still frozen high in its potential , and so it leads to a second phase of inflation for @xmath67 @xmath0-folds before it also decays . in this scenario",
    ", @xmath22 is always unity .",
    "we denote the amount of inflation corresponding to the pivot scale of observables by @xmath68 .    any modes which reenter the horizon during the gap between the two inflationary periods , and then re - exit during the second inflationary period ,",
    "will have an strongly oscillatory pattern imprinted @xcite .",
    "we will require that all such modes are on smaller scales than we can observationally probe .",
    "we hence require @xmath66 to be at least 10 , and potentially significantly more if a large range of scales re - enter the horizon during the break between inflationary periods .",
    "the gap between the two periods of inflation will last while the hubble parameter decreases from @xmath69 until the curvaton s energy density becomes dominant , @xmath70 .",
    "the range of scales re - entering during this break also depends on whether the background energy density is dominated by radiation or matter .",
    "regardless of how many scales re - enter the horizon during this gap , the total number of @xmath0-foldings is still required to be roughly between 50 and 60 . this is because the total number of @xmath0-foldings corresponding to a given comoving scale depends only on the energy scale of the first inflationary period and how long the matter and radiation dominated epochs last , and not on the order in which they take place , see sec .",

    "a significant suppression of @xmath40 in the curvaton limit is generic for all curvaton models , suggesting that this result has ruled out the curvaton limit ( i.e.  the original curvaton scenario assumption [ curvaton - limit ] ) regardless of the choice of inflaton and curvaton potentials .",
