    "ultraviolet observations of nearby stars from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) have proven unexpectedly to be very useful for studying the outermost heliosphere .",
    "high resolution spectra of the h  i ly@xmath0 line at 1215.67    sometimes show signatures of absorption from h  i in the heliosphere , in cases where the interstellar absorption is weak enough to allow the heliospheric signal to be detectable @xcite .",
    "absorption is also sometimes observed from the astrosphere of the observed star , which has provided the first detections and measurements of winds from solar - like stars @xcite .",
    "figure  1 shows a picture of the basic heliospheric structure , which is characterized by three sharp boundaries ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the innermost is the termination shock , where the solar wind is decelerated to subsonic speeds .",
    "then there is the heliopause , which separates the plasma flows of the fully ionized solar wind and partially ionized ism .",
    "although the charged constituents of the ism can not penetrate the heliopause , the neutral atoms in the ism flow can .",
    "the outermost boundary is the bow shock , where the ism flow is decelerated to subsonic speeds ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the _ voyager  1 _ satellite , which is traveling close to the upwind direction of the ism flow seen by the sun , has recently crossed the termination shock at a distance of 94  au from the sun @xcite , roughly consistent with the model predictions in figure  1 .    for most lines of sight , the ly@xmath0 absorption from heliospheric h  i will be dominated by the so - called `` hydrogen wall '' region between the heliopause and bow shock ( region  3 in fig .  1 ) , where models predict that interstellar h  i will be heated , compressed , and decelerated after crossing the bow shock @xcite .",
    "there are currently a total of 8 detections of heliospheric absorption .",
    "all but one are in upwind directions . to be more precise , if we define @xmath2 to be the angle between the observed line of sight and the upwind direction of the ism flow vector seen by the sun , all but one of the lines of sight with detected heliospheric absorption have @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with model predictions , which demonstrate that the deceleration of h  i within the hydrogen wall relative to the ism flow is strongest in upwind directions .",
    "this helps to separate the heliospheric absorption from the ism absorption , making the heliospheric signal easier to detect .",
    "neutrals within the heliosphere interact with other particles almost entirely via charge exchange , densities being too low for thermal particle collisions to be important .",
    "the population of hydrogen wall h  i that dominates ly@xmath0 absorption in upwind directions is formed by charge exchange between interstellar h  i that has passed unimpeded through the bow shock and ism protons that have been heated , decelerated , and compressed at the bow shock .",
    "however , interstellar neutrals can also penetrate the heliopause and charge exchange with solar wind protons in the heliosheath region in between the termination shock and heliopause ( region  2 in fig .  1 ) .",
    "downwind lines of sight that look through the tail of the heliosphere will have extended path lengths through the heliosheath .",
    "the ly@xmath0 absorption in such directions , if it can be detected , will potentially be dominated by the heliosheath rather than the hydrogen wall .    in this paper , we focus on observations and model predictions concerning ly@xmath0 absorption from heliosheath neutrals .",
    "there are several reasons why this is useful .",
    "one is simply that heliosheath absorption probes a different region of the heliosphere than the hydrogen wall absorption that dominates nearly all previous detections of heliospheric and astrospheric ly@xmath0 absorption .",
    "another reason is that hydrodynamic models of the heliosphere that use a fully kinetic treatment of the neutrals seem to predict a disturbingly large amount of heliosheath absorption in downwind directions , which may be in conflict with nondetections of absorption in those directions @xcite .",
    "we will take a closer look at these downwind hst data to see if any evidence for heliosheath absorption can be found . if not , we will derive upper limits for the amount of absorption that can be present .",
    "finally , observed heliosheath absorption can potentially be used to constrain the flux of energetic neutral atoms ( enas ) that should be observable within our solar system .",
    "local ena fluxes should be dominated by neutrals created by charge exchange within the heliosheath that are then directed through the termination shock towards the sun .",
    "thus , locally observed enas basically sample the same particle population as the heliosheath absorption . in 2008 ,",
    "the _ interstellar boundary explorer _ ( ibex ) will be launched , which is entirely devoted to studying enas @xcite .",
    "constraints on ena fluxes from ly@xmath0 absorption will be valuable in preparation for this mission .",
    "furthermore , the aspera-3 instrument on board the _ mars express _ satellite has already reported a detection of heliospheric enas @xcite .",
    "we will make an initial assessment as to whether the ena fluxes observed by aspera-3 are consistent with heliosheath absorption detections and/or upper limits .",
    "currently the only detection of heliospheric ly@xmath0 absorption in a downwind direction , where heliosheath absorption should dominate the hydrogen wall absorption , is for the sirius line of sight at @xmath4 .",
    "the sirius data are shown in figure  2 .",
    "the ism ly@xmath0 absorption for this line of sight is derived with the assistance of constraints provided by other ism absorption lines @xcite .",
    "there is excess absorption on both sides of the ly@xmath0 line that can not be accounted for by the ism .",
    "the excess on the blue side of the line ( at @xmath5 km  s@xmath6 in the figure ) is believed to be from the stellar wind of sirius , which is a hot a0  v star @xcite .",
    "the excess on the red side of the line ( at @xmath7 km  s@xmath6 ) , based on the ism parameters derived by @xcite , is claimed by @xcite to be heliospheric absorption .",
    "there are serious problems with this sirius data , and with the detection of heliospheric absorption .",
    "the spectral resolution is lower than any other spectrum with a claimed heliospheric absorption detection .",
    "thus , the wavelength calibration will be more uncertain . the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of the data is also low , as figure  2 clearly shows .",
    "the presence of the wind absorption complicates the analysis of the blue side of the line , including the d  i absorption @xcite .",
    "finally , observations of narrower ism lines demonstrate that there are actually two distinct ism velocity components for this line of sight , which further complicates the ly@xmath0 analysis .",
    "@xcite are able to fit hst ly@xmath0 spectra of both sirius and its companion sirius  b without any need for the existence of excess red - side absorption , but this interpretation of the data ideally requires the assumption of a very low d / h ratio for the weaker of the two ism components seen towards sirius , which would contradict recent claims that d / h within the local bubble is constant , with a value around @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "thus , we still consider the presence of excess red - side absorption , possibly heliospheric in origin , to be a plausible interpretation of the data . despite its problems , the line of sight does have the advantage of having one of the lowest ism h  i column densities ever observed , due mostly to its very short distance of @xmath9  pc .",
    "the @xcite analysis suggests an ism column density ( in @xmath10 ) of @xmath11 , while @xcite infer @xmath12 .",
    "both values are lower than any other hst - observed downwind line of sight . with the ism absorption being therefore weaker than any other downwind line of sight ,",
    "this would explain why sirius is so far the only such line of sight with a heliospheric absorption detection .",
    "figure  2 also shows the absorption predicted by a hydrodynamic model of the heliosphere .",
    "the model used here is of the type described by @xcite , which includes a fully kinetic treatment of the neutrals within the heliosphere .",
    "the neutral hydrogen density , proton density , velocity , and temperature of the undisturbed ism assumed in this model are : @xmath13  @xmath14 , @xmath15  @xmath14 , @xmath16 km  s@xmath6 , and @xmath17  k. the top panel of figure  2 shows absorption predicted for both the upwind 36  oph line of sight ( at @xmath18 ) and the downwind sirius line of sight ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we choose the 36  oph line of sight for comparison because it represents the most upwind detection of heliospheric absorption , while sirius is the only downwind detection @xcite .",
    "both absorption profiles are significantly redshifted relative to the local ism flow speed in those directions , based on the local interstellar cloud vector @xcite .",
    "this is why heliospheric absorption is always found on the red side of the ism absorption .",
    "since astrospheric absorption is observed from outside the astrosphere rather than inside , it is conversely found on the _ blue _ side of the ism absorption .",
    "the absorption predicted for the sirius line of sight is added to the ism absorption and the result is compared with the data in figure  2 .",
    "the model appears to predict too much absorption at @xmath19 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "similar results have previously been found when comparing other kinetic models with downwind observations @xcite .",
    "since charge exchange processes drive the neutrals in the heliosphere out of thermal equilibrium , models with a fully kinetic treatment of the neutrals would seem to be necessary to provide the most precise description of neutral velocity distributions within the heliosphere , which in turn should provide the most accurate ly@xmath0 absorption profiles .",
    "nevertheless , these kinetic models generally seem to overpredict heliosheath absorption in downwind directions .    however , the nature of the heliosheath absorption predicted by the models is such that it is not easy to entirely rule out its presence for observed downwind lines of sight .",
    "the top panel of figure  2 shows that the heliosheath absorption towards sirius is characterized by a very broad , extended wing on the red side of the profile .",
    "this is very different from the absorption profile for the upwind 36  oph line of sight , which is dominated by the hydrogen wall .",
    "heliosheath neutrals are generally much hotter than hydrogen wall neutrals , but heliosheath neutral column densities are much lower .",
    "this is why the heliosheath absorption tends to be broad but shallow compared to the hydrogen wall absorption .",
    "note that there is a weak extended wing for the 36  oph absorption that would correspond to heliosheath absorption in that direction , but the absorption is too weak to be detectable .",
    "the weakness of the wing is simply because the heliosheath is much narrower in upwind directions ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the hydrogen wall absorption produces a rather sharp , well - defined absorption edge , which is something that can be compared with the data in a reasonably definitive manner to see whether the model is consistent with the data .",
    "however , the broad extended wing of the heliosheath absorption in downwind directions complicates matters , for reasons we now describe .",
    "one of the primary sources of systematic uncertainty in any of these ly@xmath0 analyses is the reconstruction of the background stellar ly@xmath0 profile @xcite .",
    "no reasonable change to an assumed stellar profile will greatly change the velocity where the ly@xmath0 absorption predicted by a model becomes saturated .",
    "this is why the sharp absorption edge provided by the hydrogen wall absorption provides a much better diagnostic to compare with the data than the broad absorption wing that characterizes the heliosheath absorption , which results in the apparent disagreement with the data in figure  2 .",
    "the red - wing absorption discrepancy in figure  2 could in principle be resolved by increasing by @xmath20% the background sirius ly@xmath0 fluxes from @xmath21 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "other examples of how stellar ly@xmath0 profiles can be modified to allow such broad wing absorption are presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there is still a limit , however , to how much one can modify the stellar profile in this fashion before the resulting profile becomes implausible , and there is therefore a limit to how much extended wing absorption can be present .",
    "for example , modifying the sirius ly@xmath0 background as described above would create a dubious asymmetry in the stellar ly@xmath0 absorption profile .",
    "quantifying exactly when `` dubious '' becomes `` completely unreasonable '' is not easy , but that is the task that we now undertake .",
    "most hst - observed nearby stars that are appropriate targets to search for heliospheric and/or astrospheric absorption are cool main sequence stars like the sun @xcite .",
    "the ly@xmath0 lines of such stars are relatively narrow , isolated emission lines .",
    "note that sirius is a hot a0  v star where the stellar profile is instead a very broad absorption line , so sirius is unfortunately not a representative example at all . as shown in figure  2 , heliosheath absorption will contaminate only the red side of a stellar emission line .",
    "therefore , if there is unrecognized and undetected heliosheath absorption , the stellar ly@xmath0 emission profile reconstructed from the hst data will end up blueshifted with respect to the stellar rest frame .",
    "the wings of the ly@xmath0 line will be formed in the chromosphere of the observed star .",
    "although emission lines formed at higher temperatures in the transition region can be shifted from the stellar rest frame , the wings of ly@xmath0 should be centered on the star @xcite .",
    "we can search for previously undetected absorption from the heliosheath by searching for cases in which reconstructed ly@xmath0 profiles end up blueshifted with respect to the star .",
    "the requirement that a stellar emission line be centered on the stellar radial velocity also provides a way to limit modifications to the stellar profile , thereby yielding upper limits to the amount of broad heliosheath absorption that can be present in the red wing of the ly@xmath0 line .",
    "@xcite provide a complete list of hst ly@xmath0 spectra of nearby stars , all 62 of which have been analyzed to measure ism h  i and d  i column densities , search for heliospheric / astrospheric absorption , measure chromospheric ly@xmath0 line fluxes corrected for ism absorption , etc . from this list",
    "we choose a selection of stars to look for shifts in the reconstructed ly@xmath0 line relative to the stellar radial velocity .",
    "we exclude hot stars , which have ly@xmath0 in absorption rather than emission .",
    "we exclude giant stars , which have ly@xmath0 emission lines that are too broad to be effective for our purposes .",
    "we also exclude short - period , unresolved binaries , partly because the stellar rest frame can change due to orbital motion during the course of the observation , and partly because in some cases both stars contribute to the ly@xmath0 emission , meaning there is no single stellar rest frame .",
    "we only consider data with reasonably high s /",
    "n , and with a spectral resolution of at least @xmath22 to maximize our confidence in the wavelength calibration .    and finally , we only consider lines of sight with ism column densities of @xmath23 .",
    "high ism columns potentially degrade the effectiveness of our analysis in a couple ways .",
    "broad ism absorption limits us to the far wings of the ly@xmath0 profile in our search for ly@xmath0 line shifts .",
    "also , the damping wings of the ism ly@xmath0 absorption are much stronger at higher columns and when the absorption is not exactly centered on the rest frame of the star , uncertainties in the ism h  i column density can potentially lead to a shift in the reconstructed stellar ly@xmath0 line that could mimic the shifts we are looking for due to heliosheath absorption .",
    "our selection criteria reduce the original sample of ly@xmath0 spectra to 28 targets .",
    "these are listed in table  1 in order of increasing @xmath2 .",
    "our analysis requires accurate knowledge of the stellar photospheric radial velocity , @xmath24 .",
    "the fourth column of table  1 lists @xmath24 for all of our stars , and the last column provides the references for these values .",
    "the quoted uncertainties are generally from these references , but we set a floor of 0.1 km  s@xmath6 for the uncertainties in table  1 . in cases where the observed star is a member of a binary system ( particularly @xmath0  cen  b and @xmath1  ori ) , we have to consider the effects of orbital motion to establish the precise radial velocity at the time of observation , so we have increased the quoted uncertainty accordingly .",
    "figure  3 illustrates how we measure the velocities of the stellar ly@xmath0 lines , using eight of the stars in table  1 as examples .",
    "the figure shows the observed ly@xmath0 spectra and the reconstructed stellar line profiles .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and references therein for details on the reconstruction process , and for complete illustrations of the line profiles .",
    "we note that all the stellar profiles used here yield d / h values consistent with the @xmath25 value now believed to apply throughout the local bubble @xcite .",
    "many of the analyses actually _ assumed _ this value ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , in which case the h  i column density is directly inferred from the more easily measured d  i column . since the wings of the h  i absorption depend solely on the h  i column density and not on the doppler parameter , the wings of the stellar ly@xmath0 profile can then be inferred simply by computing the ly@xmath0 opacity profile , @xmath26 , from the h  i column density and multiplying the observed wings by @xmath27 .    in figure  3 , we focus only on the lower flux part of the ly@xmath0 profile where we can measure meaningful line centroids for comparison with the radial velocity",
    ". the top parts of the profile are not useful for our purposes for two reasons .",
    "the first is that the section of the profile above the saturated core of the ism h  i absorption is in reality completely unconstrained by the data .",
    "the second is that cool star ly@xmath0 line profiles ( including that of the sun ) can have asymmetric self - reversals near line center ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , meaning that this part of the profile will not necessarily be centered on the star .",
    "the horizontal dotted lines in figure  3 indicate flux levels where we measure the centroid of the line .",
    "collectively these centroids form a line bisector .",
    "these bisectors are shown as near - vertical solid lines in the figure . for five of the stars ( 70  oph  a",
    ", @xmath28  ind , @xmath29  dor , @xmath30  cet , and @xmath28  eri ) the bisector ends up where we expect it , very close to the stellar radial velocity .",
    "however , for the three most downwind lines of sight ( @xmath1  ori , hd  28205 , and hd  28568 ) the bisector is significantly blueshifted with respect to the star .",
    "this is exactly the signature of undetected heliosheath absorption that we are looking for , and the downwind direction is where we expect to see it .",
    "we compute the average velocity of the bisector , @xmath31 , for each star , ignoring the lowest two flux levels where low s /",
    "n in the extreme far wings of the line sometimes causes unreasonable excursions in the bisector ( e.g. , hd  28568 in fig .  3 ) .",
    "these bisector velocities are listed in table  1 .",
    "we define the discrepancy between these velocities and the stellar rest frame as @xmath32 . in figure  4 , @xmath33 is plotted versus @xmath2 for all the stars listed in table  1 .    for the three @xmath34 cases",
    "the ly@xmath0 profile is significantly blueshifted .",
    "this blueshift is common to all @xmath34 lines of sight , is not seen in other directions , and is exactly in the direction where we would expect heliosheath absorption to be maximized .",
    "thus , we conclude that it is highly likely that heliosheath absorption is responsible for these ly@xmath0 blueshifts . for each of these stars",
    ", we can construct a stellar profile that is forced to be centered on the stellar rest frame by reflecting the blue wing of the original reconstructed profile across the stellar radial velocity onto the red wing . the flux difference between the red wing of this profile and the original one provides an estimate of the heliosheath absorption that is present , which can be compared with the predictions of hydrodynamic models of the heliosphere .",
    "other than the three @xmath34 sight lines , the reconstructed ly@xmath0 profiles are encouragingly close to their expected locations at the stellar radial velocity .",
    "the average and standard deviation of the @xmath35 data points is @xmath36 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the scatter can be easily explained by uncertainties in the spectral wavelength calibration , and systematic errors present in the profile reconstruction process .",
    "we note that most of the hst data for the stars listed in table  1 are stis / e140 m spectra , which have demonstrated 1@xmath37 random wavelength calibration uncertainties of @xmath38 km  s@xmath6 @xcite . this same analysis also found a systematic offset of @xmath39 km  s@xmath6 for stis / e140 m ly@xmath0 spectra .",
    "we corrected all the stis / e140 m spectra for this shift before starting the bisector analysis .",
    "the centering of the @xmath33 values on 0 km  s@xmath6 ( for @xmath35 ) implies that this correction successfully removed all significant systematic wavelength calibration problems .",
    "none of the @xmath35 profiles is shifted away from the stellar rest frame by more than 3 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "these results imply that a reconstructed stellar ly@xmath0 line should be within 3 km  s@xmath6 of the stellar rest frame to be reasonable .",
    "this limits how much the ly@xmath0 profiles can be changed to allow for potential heliosheath absorption .",
    "we can therefore use these limits to establish upper bounds on the amount of heliosheath absorption that can be present for the @xmath35 lines of sight listed in table  1 .    to construct an upper limit to the red wing of the ly@xmath0 profile ,",
    "we define an upper limit bisector that at all flux levels is @xmath40 km  s@xmath6 from the stellar radial velocity or @xmath40 km  s@xmath6 from the velocity of the original bisector , whichever is largest .",
    "an upper limit for the red wing of the ly@xmath0 profile is then derived by reflecting the blue wing of the original reconstructed profile across the upper limit bisector .",
    "figure  5 shows the result for the case of @xmath30  cet .",
    "the difference between the upper limit profile and the original one represents an estimate of the maximum amount of heliosheath absorption that can be present in that direction .    one final issue worthy of mention concerns astrospheric absorption .",
    "if we observed a star through the downwind tail of its astrosphere , it is possible that astrosheath absorption would lead to a reconstructed stellar ly@xmath0 profile that is _ redshifted _ relative to the star rather than blueshifted , keeping in mind that astrospheric absorption appears on the opposite side of the ly@xmath0 line from the heliospheric absorption ( see  2.1 ) .",
    "however , figure  4 shows no data points with @xmath41 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "given that a heliospheric effect is only seen for @xmath34 , we conclude that either none of these 28 sight lines has @xmath34 for the stellar astrosphere , or if there are any @xmath34 astrospheric lines of sight the ism surrounding the star contains no neutrals to provide ly@xmath0 absorption , which should be a common occurrence within the mostly ionized local bubble @xcite .",
    "as an example of how the heliosheath absorption detections and upper limits can be used , we now compare the ly@xmath0 data with the predictions of a pair of heliospheric models .",
    "one of the models is the kinetic model described in  2.1 and used in figure  2 .",
    "this model is of the @xcite type , which uses a fully kinetic treatment of the neutrals but treats the plasma as a single hydrodynamic fluid .",
    "this plasma treatment is simplistic . the best evidence for this concerns pick - up ions inside the termination shock ( region  1 in fig .  1 ) .",
    "pick - up ions originate from charge exchange between outflowing solar wind protons and inflowing ism neutrals , which creates a solar wind neutral h atom and an inflowing ion that is then `` picked - up '' by the solar wind .",
    "observations show that the pick - up ions are not thermalized with the solar wind , and the pickup ions also show non - maxellian velocity distributions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , combining solar wind plasma and pick - up ions into a single fluid in a heliospheric model , as is typically done , will lead to inaccuracies in the particle distributions .",
    "@xcite have recently attempted to solve this problem by modifying the baranov & malama heliospheric modeling code to allow a complex multi - component treatment of the plasma , as well as including the usual full kinetic treatment of the neutrals .",
    "we consider here a multi - component model of this type using the same input parameters assumed in the single - component model ( see  2.1 ) .",
    "figure  1 shows the differences in global heliospheric structure suggested by the two models .",
    "figure  6 compares the absorption predicted by the single- and multi - component models with the ly@xmath0 absorption observed for four downwind lines of sight , including the sirius line of sight discussed in  2.1 .",
    "the figure focuses on the red side of the absorption where the heliospheric absorption should be located . using the original reconstructed stellar profiles ,",
    "the ism absorption alone is illustrated , and the absorption predicted by the heliospheric models is shown after being added to the ism absorption .",
    "dashed lines in figure  6 indicate the extra heliosheath absorption that is allowable by the data based on the upper limit stellar profiles derived as described in the previous section ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "models can be considered to be consistent with the data if they do not predict more absorption than these dashed lines , so the dot - dashed lines should lie above the dashed lines in figure  6 .",
    "the dashed lines have a lower velocity limit in figure  6 .",
    "this is because the line bisector analysis described above is not applicable close to line center ( for reasons discussed in  2.2 ) , so we can not really quantify an upper limit to the profile near line center .",
    "no absorption limits have been derived for sirius since it is a hot star where the stellar profile is a broad absorption line rather than a comparatively narrow emission line ( see  2.2 ) . however , as described in  2.1 , this is the one downwind line of sight with a previous detection of heliosheath absorption , with the ism absorption underpredicting the observed absorption in figures  2 and 6 .",
    "as described in  2.2 , the ly@xmath0 bisector analysis suggests that @xmath1  ori and two other very downwind lines of sight ( hd  28205 , hd  28568 ) show evidence for broad heliosheath absorption .",
    "the thick solid line in the @xmath1  ori panel of figure  6 corresponds to the amount of excess absorption that _ should _ be present to allow a stellar line profile that is centered on the rest frame of the star . for @xmath1  ori , therefore , the model absorption in figure  6 is best compared with the thick solid line rather than with the data . we could have added panels for hd  28205 and hd  28568 to figure  6 , but this would be somewhat redundant since the @xmath1  ori , hd  28205 , and hd  28568 lines of sight are very similar , and the @xmath1  ori data are in any case far superior to the others in terms of s / n .",
    "the negative radial velocity of @xmath1  ori profile also makes that line of sight superior to hd  28205 and hd  28568 .",
    "a blueshifted profile means that the bisector method can detect and quantify heliosheath absorption at lower heliocentric velocities than for redshifted profiles like those of hd  28205 and hd  28568 , since you can not do the search close to the center of the stellar profile . for @xmath1",
    "ori , we can extend the dashed and solid lines down to @xmath42 km  s@xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "6 ) , but for hd  28205 and hd 28568 this could only be done down to @xmath43 km  s@xmath6 .    the absorption limits ( dashed lines in fig .  6 ) allow a significant amount of broad heliosheath absorption to exist while still being consistent with the data .",
    "thus , the initial impression of disagreement between the models and the data in figures 2 and 6 is partly illusory .",
    "the multi - component model predicts less absorption than the single - component model .",
    "this provides better agreement with the data , particularly for the sirius line of sight .",
    "the absorption predicted by the single - component model may be in conflict with the absorption limit towards @xmath28  eri near 100 km  s@xmath6 , but the conflict is greatly lessened for the multi - component model .",
    "the greater amount of broad heliosheath absorption for the single - component model indicates that the simplistic treatment of the plasma in this model overemphasizes the effects of minority high - temperature constituents on the plasma velocity distribution .",
    "the effect is to artificially broaden the distribution , a problem that is then transmitted to the neutral distributions via charge exchange .",
    "one very important caveat that must be mentioned is that the heliospheric models that we have employed here use a spatial grid that extends only 700  au from the sun ( see fig .  1 ) , which may not extend far enough to capture all the heliospheric absorption in downwind directions along the lengthy tail of the heliosphere .",
    "thus , the model absorption predictions in figure  6 may end up being lower limits to the actual amount of absorption that these models would really predict given a sufficiently large grid",
    ". this problem could potentially worsen agreement between the models and the data , particularly for the most downwind directions where the bisector analysis has provided new evidence for heliosheath absorption . in the future , we will expand the grid for the multi - component model up to 10,000 au , as has already been done for single - fluid baranov & malama models @xcite .",
    "the aspera-3 instrument on _ mars express _ was designed primarily to study particles escaping from the martian atmosphere @xcite .",
    "however , aspera-3 has detected enas even when not pointed at mars , both en route to mars and while in orbit around the planet . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have argued that a heliosheath origin for these particles is more likely than a more local interplanetary source .",
    "the particle energy spectra observed for the nonplanetary enas are nearly always consistent with the following power law behavior @xcite : @xmath44 particle fluxes are variable , though the nature of the aspera-3 observations makes it difficult to distinguish temporal from spatial variability . within aspera-3 s energy range of @xmath45 kev ,",
    "logarithmic particle fluxes are in the range @xmath46 ( in @xmath10 s@xmath6 ster@xmath6 units ) .",
    "if the nonplanetary enas observed by aspera-3 are indeed heliosheath neutrals , they then represent the same particle population that we have been investigating with regards to the ly@xmath0 absorption produced by these neutrals .",
    "thus , we can in principle test the heliosheath interpretation of the nonplanetary aspera-3 enas by seeing if the observed fluxes are consistent with the ly@xmath0 data .",
    "dotted lines in figure  7 illustrate the observed energy spectrum given by equation ( 1 ) , with the lower and upper lines indicating the lower and upper range of observed fluxes .",
    "the lower bound of aspera-3 s energy range , 0.2  kev , represents a particle velocity of 196 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "this corresponds with the _ upper _ bound of the @xmath47 km  s@xmath6 velocity range where the ly@xmath0 data provide the best absorption constraints ( see fig .",
    "thus , before we can even hope to use the aspera-3 measurements to predict ly@xmath0 absorption , we must extrapolate the aspera-3 energy spectra to lower energies .",
    "there are three different extrapolations assumed in figure  7 .",
    "the solid line simply continues the @xmath48 power law to lower energies .",
    "the dashed line assumes a flat spectrum below 0.2  kev , and the dot - dashed line assumes a drop in flux below 0.2  kev . the four figure  7 panels show the resulting spectra for four different values of @xmath49 .",
    "the biggest difficulty in connecting the aspera-3 ena and hst ly@xmath0 data lies in the issue of how to extrapolate a locally observed particle spectrum along an entire line of sight through the heliosphere . if the heliosheath is the source of the enas , then for our purposes the region inside the termination shock ( region  1 in fig .",
    "1 ) is in effect an empty cavity that is being filled by a flux of heliosheath particles from all directions .",
    "the heliosphere is not spherically symmetric , so it is likely that fluxes will be larger from some directions than others .",
    "nevertheless , assuming that within the termination shock the particle distributions are isotropic and the same throughout region  1 may be a reasonable first - order approximation .",
    "this will probably not be the case within the heliosheath itself .",
    "thus , for our purposes here , we will confine our attention only to absorption by heliosheath neutrals within the termination shock .    in downwind directions , which are the most appropriate for heliosheath ly@xmath0 absorption ,",
    "the termination shock distance is about 200  au ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the inset figures in figure  7 show the ly@xmath0 absorption produced by heliosheath neutrals within this distance , assuming that the ena spectra shown in the figure are isotropic and apply along the entire 200  au path length .",
    "the absorption limits derived for the @xmath30  cet and @xmath28  eri lines of sight in  2.2 ( see fig .",
    "6 ) are also shown , for comparison with the absorption predicted by the ena spectra .",
    "the two highest flux values explored in figure  7 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , clearly lead to too much ly@xmath0 absorption to be consistent with the limits from the hst data .",
    "a flux of @xmath52 is only consistent with the ly@xmath0 data if fluxes decrease below 0.2  kev , and even the lowest flux of @xmath53 is only consistent with the absorption limits if the particle fluxes are flat or decrease below 0.2  kev .",
    "the situation is actually even worse than this , given that the absorption predictions in figure  7 only include absorption from within the termination shock . considering that a downwind line of sight will have a path length through the heliosheath much longer than the @xmath54  au path length inside the termination shock ,",
    "it is clear that including absorption from the heliosheath could easily increase the amount of absorption many times above the predictions shown in figure  7 . with this in mind",
    ", it is very questionable whether _ any _ of the energy spectra in figure  7 are consistent with the relative lack of heliospheric absorption observed in downwind directions . at the very least , the spectrum must lie near the lower bound of the aspera-3 range , with fluxes that decrease to lower energies .",
    "it is worth noting that the flux range quoted by @xcite does not take into account numerous upper limits when no enas were detected ( see fig .  4 in * ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that perhaps the lower bound could be decreased further without being truly discrepant with the aspera-3 data .",
    "nevertheless , our difficulty in reconciling the aspera-3 ena fluxes with the hst ly@xmath0 spectra is a strong argument against the aspera-3 enas being heliosheath neutrals .",
    "@xcite acknowledge other difficulties with the heliosheath interpretation .",
    "one is that many heliospheric models predict ena fluxes at earth about an order of magnitude lower than those observed by aspera-3 @xcite .",
    "the substantial variability seen by aspera-3 is also potentially difficult for a distant heliosheath source to explain , and is more suggestive of a local interplanetary source .",
    "identifying the origin of the aspera-3 enas is particularly important considering the upcoming 2008 launch of ibex , which unlike aspera-3 is entirely designed and devoted to studying heliosheath enas .",
    "if there is an unexpectedly strong local interplanetary ena source that is responsible for the aspera-3 enas , ibex will presumably see it as well and will somehow have to distinguish between these particles and the true heliosheath enas to accomplish its mission .",
    "it is also worth noting that the aspera-4 instrument on board _ venus express _ will soon be able to confirm or refute aspera-3 s measurements of nonplanetary enas .",
    "based on figure  7 , we quote a very conservative upper limit of @xmath55 @xmath10 s@xmath6 ster@xmath6 for the local flux of heliosheath enas in the @xmath56  kev energy range most applicable to the ly@xmath0 absorption data .",
    "the aspera-3 and aspera-4 instruments are not sensitive to these low energies , but ibex will be . unless the heliosheath unexpectedly produces significantly less absorption than the region inside the termination shock , the actual @xmath56  kev flux can be expected to be well below this limit .",
    "more precise constraints on ena fluxes from the ly@xmath0 data will require the assistance of kinetic heliospheric models to better connect heliosheath absorption along a downwind line of sight with the ena energy spectrum close to the sun .",
    "once ibex is launched it will be very interesting to see if heliospheric models are capable of simultaneously reproducing both the local ena spectrum and the heliosheath absorption data , particularly the previously detected absorption towards sirius and the three new @xmath34 detections reported here for the first time .",
    "the absorption within the ly@xmath0 lines of nearby stars sometimes has a detectable heliospheric contribution , in addition to the ubiquitous interstellar h  i and d  i absorption .",
    "most detections are in upwind directions , where the hydrogen wall dominates the absorption . however , in this paper we have focused on absorption from the heliosheath , which is only prominent in downwind directions .",
    "our findings are as follows :    1 . : :    in order to search for evidence of previously undetected heliosheath    absorption , we have measured the bisectors of 28 stellar    ly@xmath0 lines reconstructed from the data after    correcting for the broad ism absorption ( and heliospheric / astrospheric    absorption , when present ) .",
    "we find that the stellar    ly@xmath0 profiles of the three most downwind lines of    sight ( @xmath1  ori , hd  28205 , and hd  28568 ) , all with    @xmath57 , are significantly blueshifted    relative to the stellar radial velocities .",
    "this is indicative of broad    absorption in the red wing of the ly@xmath0 line that was    not accounted for in the reconstruction of the stellar profile .",
    "this    is exactly the signature of heliosheath absorption we are looking for ,    and the most downwind lines of sight are where we expect to see it .",
    "thus , we add these three lines of sight to the list of eight previous    heliospheric ly@xmath0 absorption detections , only one of    which ( sirius ) is a downwind line of sight . for the three new    detections , the amount of heliospheric absorption can be estimated by    reanalyzing the ly@xmath0 data using a stellar profile    that is forced to be centered on the stellar rest frame .",
    "2 . : :    the stellar ly@xmath0 profiles of the 25 lines of sight    with @xmath58 are all found to be within    @xmath59 km  s@xmath6 of the stellar radial    velocity . this represents a conservative quantitative estimate of the    accuracy of the reconstructed ly@xmath0 profiles .",
    "we can    define an upper limit to the red wing of the stellar    ly@xmath0 profile by requiring the bisector to be no more    than @xmath40 km  s@xmath6 from either the stellar    radial velocity or the bisector of the original reconstructed profile ,    whichever is greatest . in this way",
    ", we derive for the first time    quantitative upper limits for the amount of broad heliosheath    absorption that can be present in the red wings of    ly@xmath0 lines without clearly detectable heliosheath    absorption .",
    "3 . : :    we compare the ly@xmath0 absorption predicted by two    kinetic heliospheric models with downwind ly@xmath0 lines    observed by hst .",
    "one model uses the complex multi - component plasma    treatment discussed by @xcite , while the other uses a simple    single - fluid approach .",
    "the multi - component model predicts    significantly less heliosheath absorption than the single - fluid model ,    in better agreement with the data .",
    "this suggests that the single - fluid    plasma approach , which is the usual assumption in heliospheric models ,    may not reproduce particle distribution functions accurately enough    for some applications .",
    "4 . : :    meaningful comparisons between models and the ly@xmath0    absorption data in downwind directions require the use of a model grid    that extends a sufficiently long distance down the tail of the    heliosphere to capture all of the heliosheath absorption .",
    "most    hydrodynamic models of the heliosphere , including the ones used here ,    do not extend the grid far enough for these purposes . in the future",
    ",    we hope to perform more precise data / model comparisons using    sufficiently large grids .",
    "5 . : :    the aspera-3 instrument on board _ mars express _ has detected a    substantial flux of nonplanetary enas , which have been interpreted as    being heliosheath neutrals .",
    "we believe that the observed ena fluxes    likely predict too much heliosheath ly@xmath0 absorption    in downwind directions to be consistent with the hst    ly@xmath0 spectra .",
    "this represents a strong argument    against a heliosheath origin for these enas , instead suggesting a    local interplanetary source .",
    ": :    the hst ly@xmath0 absorption data can provide useful    constraints on the heliosheath ena fluxes that ibex can expect to    observe when launched in 2008 .",
    "we here quote a very conservative upper    limit of @xmath55 @xmath10    s@xmath6 ster@xmath6 for the local flux of    heliosheath enas in the @xmath56  kev energy range most    applicable to the ly@xmath0 absorption data .",
    "we hope to    compute more stringent constraints in the future using kinetic models    of the heliosphere to connect particle distributions in the    heliosheath with those that ibex will observe locally .",
