    "normal galaxies , defined as those with on - going star formation , account for most of the luminous mass in the local universe .",
    "their luminosity is derived from stars and they span a broad range of observed morphologies , luminosities , and infrared - to - blue ratios .",
    "results from  have shown that the infrared colors from the four  bands are sensitive indices of the radiation intensity in the interstellar medium . the mid - infrared ( 5 - 20 ) emission",
    "is dominated by very small grains fluctuating to high temperatures and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) ( helou et al . 2000 ) .",
    "these grains are not in thermal equilibrium but they still convert heating photons and thereby trace star formation .",
    "larger grains in thermal equilibrium dominate the emission from normal galaxies at longer wavelengths . by comparing the mid - infrared emission to other components of the galaxy such as , h@xmath2 , ionized gas , and starlight , one can derive the physical properties of the interstellar gas , dust and radiation field in galaxies ( e.g. vigroux et al .",

    "the _ infrared space observatory _ ( ) u.s . key project on normal galaxies ( pi : g. helou , proposal i d : sf_glx _ , hereafter the `` key project '' ) was proposed to study the interstellar medium of a broad range of normal galaxies using three of the four instruments aboard : isocam , isolws , and isophot . under nasa guaranteed time , the u.s .",
    "key project obtained  observations of 69 galaxies .",
    "nine relatively nearby and extended galaxies were chosen to provide spatially resolved cases so that various phases of the interstellar medium could be studied independently .",
    "the remaining 60 galaxies in the key project sample cover the full range of observed morphologies , luminosities , and  colors seen in normal galaxies . using this diverse sample ,",
    "we hope to gain new insight into the star formation process on the scale of galaxies , especially its drivers and inhibitors ( helou et al .",
    "the isocam sample of galaxies for the key project is presented in table [ tab : camsample ] where we list each galaxy s position , optical size , morphology , recession velocity , distance estimate , and far - infrared - to - blue ratio .",
    "the positions , optical sizes , and velocities come from the nasa extragalactic database and were last updated february 2000 .",
    "the distances were computed in the local group reference frame assuming a hubble constant of 75 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , except for ic 10 for which we rely on results from recent cepheid variable observations ( wilson et al .",
    "1996 ; saha et al . 1996 ) , and for ngc 1569 in which case a distance has been computed from _ hubble space telescope _",

    "the mean distance of the sample is 34 mpc .",

    "1991 ) optical morphological classification for each galaxy was kindly re - examined by h. corwin using the poss plates and more recent ccd observations by the key project team and those found in the literature ; we have updated a total of 17 rc3 morphologies .",
    "figure [ fig : morphs ] shows the histogram of optical morphological types .",
    "the morphologies are lenticular or later except for one elliptical , ngc 6958 .",
    "there is an approximately even distribution of spirals and a large number of irregulars in the final sample .    in all , five of the nine relatively extended key project galaxies and 56 of the 60 smaller key project galaxies were mapped with isocam .",
    "these galaxies span a broad range in physical properties such as total luminosity , dust temperature , and star formation activity .",
    "figure [ fig : iras - iras ] is a color - color diagram of ratios of  flux densities for the sample ( see table [ tab : fluxes ] ) .",
    "quiescent galaxies such as ngc 7418 lie along the upper left of the distribution while more active star forming galaxies such as ngc 1569 are found to the lower right .",
    "observations were made using the 32@xmath432 pixel si : ga long wavelength ( lw ) array of isocam ( csarsky et al .",
    "1996 ) aboard iso ( kessler et al . 1996 ) .",
    "we utilized the narrow - band lw1 filter ( 4.5 , @xmath5 ) , the broad - band lw2 filter ( 6.75 , @xmath6 ) , and broad - band lw3 filter ( 15.0 , @xmath7 ) to sample the mid - infrared emission from the galaxies . the mid - infrared regime represents a transition from stellar to interstellar emission , though the former should be negligible at 6.75  for the majority of our sample . from isophot observations ( helou et al .",
    "2000 ) we know there are strong aromatic emission features at 6.2 , 7.7 and 8.6 , all of which fall within the 6.75  filter .",
    "the 15  filter contains some emission from aromatics at 11.3 and 12.7 , and continuum emission from very small grains .",
    "we note that strong  ( 12.8 ) and  ( 15.6 ) fine structure lines have been observed in the spectra of  regions ( e.g. m17 ; csarsky et al .",
    "rotational h@xmath2 lines are also seen in the lw3 bandpass ( kunze et al .",
    "1996 , valentijn et al .",
    "1996 , timmerman et al .",
    "1996 ) , and while these lines are important physically , their contribution to the total flux is very small ( helou et al . 2000 ) .",
    "all of our isocam observations used a gain setting of 2 and a 6@xmath46  pixel scale .",
    "tables [ tab : small_maps ] and [ tab : large_maps ] list the date , revolution ( orbit number during the  mission ) , and exposure times for each galaxy . for six galaxies ( ngc  1313 , ngc  3620 , ngc  5713 , ic  4595 , ngc  6753 , ngc  7771 ) ,",
    "the 4.5  observations were not done at the same time as the 6.75 and 15  observations , so the 4.5  maps for these galaxies are at a different roll angle compared to the 6.75 and 15  maps .",
    "the bulk of our isocam observations are in the form of 2@xmath42 overlapping raster maps ( table [ tab : small_maps ] ) with a raster step of 75 , or 12.5 pixel widths , executed along the axes of the array .",
    "thus the final maps are 445@xmath4445 , and the half - integer pixel raster spacing yields an inner 195@xmath4195 portion that is sampled every 3 ; the final maps are rebinned onto a 3  pixel@xmath3 grid .",
    "five galaxies have larger raster maps ( table [ tab : large_maps ] ) , with up to 8@xmath48 pointings and a step size of 81 , or 13.5 pixel widths .",
    "these larger maps are also rebinned onto a 3  pixel@xmath3 grid .",
    "the isocam observations were reduced using the cam interactive analysis ( cia ) software package ( delaney 1998 ) using pipeline 7 datasets .",
    "the reduction steps include dark subtraction , deglitching , transient removal , and flat - field correction .",
    "we experimented with various methods for each step , with the goal of finding a reduction method that worked well for the entire galaxy sample .",
    "the arrival of the first wave of isocam observations in mid-1996 allowed us to explore in some detail various reduction and analysis techniques .",
    "this early work indicated that the library dark distributed with each dataset did an acceptable job in removing the effects of the dark current .",
    "the default deglitcher , which uses the multi - resolution median transform method ( starck et al .",
    "1999 ) , did the best job in removing the transitory cosmic ray and charged particle hits without simultaneously flagging the source data as bad data .",
    "library sky flats from some revolutions have cosmic - ray / charged particle residuals , so we investigated how to use the observations themselves to create a target field sky flat .",
    "we found that as long as the galaxy is not too extended or too bright , we could create a good sky flat from the target field data .",
    "the only remaining task was to remove the effects of the finite response time , which can artificially increase or decrease flux detections , referred to below as `` transient removal . ''",
    "all transient removal techniques that existed within cia circa 1997 were tested to identify the one best suited for our type of observations . in particular , we studied in detail the relative merits of the ` fit3 , ' ` inverse , ' and ` fouks - schubert ' methods . all other options ",
    "dark , deglitcher , target field sky flat  were unchanged in the tests .",
    "individual pixels from both on and off - source observations were examined before and after transient removal , and the final maps were inspected .",
    "the ` fit3 ' ( siebenmorgen et al . 1997 ) method appeared to do the best job but it leaves the first raster position , the one most affected by the transient , at a slightly different flux level than the remaining raster positions .",
    "this is because ` fit3 ' removes the transient effect independently for each raster position .",
    "thus , the average map from each raster position will have a slightly different sky value , with the first raster position being more discrepant ( usually by more than 5% ) compared to the remaining raster positions . to solve this problem , we experimented with masking out the first raster position .",
    "several of the transient removal methods were re - tested , and again the ` fit3 ' method appeared to work best in terms of removing the transient from individual pixels , both on and off - source , and producing a `` good '' final map .    in summary ,",
    "the data reduction steps we use were as follows .",
    "first , starting with the standard processed data ( spd ) of the pipeline processing , a library dark is subtracted from each frame .",
    "next , each frame is deglitched using the multi - resolution median transform method .",
    "then all of the frames in the first raster position are masked out ( not used to produce the final map ) .",
    "next , transients are removed using the saclay ` fit3 ' model .",
    "the frames from each raster position are averaged together , and then these average images are used to make a target field sky flat . for the 4.5  maps the library sky flat was used , as the sky flux in these maps is too low to produce good target field sky flats from the data .",
    "next , the flat - fielded average images are mosaicked to create the final map .",
    "the final step converts the pixel units from adu / gain / second to mjy .",
    "figure [ fig : cam_images ] presents optical digitized sky survey ( dss ) images and isocam maps for the 2@xmath42 raster sample of galaxies , arranged one row per galaxy . figures [ fig : ic10]-[fig : n6946 ] present the larger raster maps , also including the optical dss images for comparison . as a consequence of the ` dead ' column # 24 in the isocam lw array ,",
    "all of the maps contain two zero value columns towards their right edge .",
    "there is also a notch in the lower left corner of the isocam maps , due to our masking of the first raster position . in many cases",
    "the maps still show low level residuals due to transients from the sources .",
    "in particular , residuals just below the source are common and result from the source being in that position during the third raster observation .",
    "there are also weak residuals in some maps from the second raster position ( the upper left in the isocam maps ) .",
    "these residuals are due to our scheme of masking the first raster position , as they are very weak or non - existent in maps made with all four raster positions .",
    "such low level residuals are masked out before source fluxes are measured .",
    "ngc 4490 and ugc  2855 are relatively large galaxies compared to the 445@xmath4445 raster maps ; for both galaxies the amount of sky area in the final maps is insufficient .",
    "we tried using sky flats from the observations themselves and the library sky flats .",
    "the results using the library sky flats are superior to the target field sky flats , leaving very weak transient residuals and a much smoother sky .",
    "the library sky flats do not appear to add any artifacts to the final maps ( as was the case for a few of our galaxies during the testing of reduction methods ) , and so for these two galaxies fluxes are determined from isocam maps reduced using library sky flats .",
    "we note that the isocam map of ngc 4490 does not contain the entire galaxy ; our 6.75 and 15  fluxes should be considered lower limits for this galaxy .",
    "we successfully detected all galaxies at all mid - infrared wavelengths attempted in our isocam program , ( though just barely for two nearby galaxies ; see  [ sec : pathetic ] ) .",
    "overall the isocam maps show many of the same features present in the optical images ; prominent spiral arms or rings , and distinct clumps and regions of relatively high mid - infrared emission are quite evident in some of the later type galaxies such as ic 4595 , ngc 1385 , ngc 3705 , ngc 4713 , ngc 7418 , and ugc 2855 .",
    "however , in most cases the bulges seen in the optical are not apparent in the mid - infrared maps .",
    "more importantly , the mid - infrared morphologies at 4.5 , 6.75 , and 15  are qualitatively similar .",
    "there are no obvious differences in how the light is distributed , though upon closer inspection of the central regions of some galaxies there are hints of variations with wavelength",
    ". a quantitative look at the relative distribution of mid - infrared emission at 6.75 and 15  will be presented in section [ sec : curve_of_growth ] .",
    "the typical sky background levels are 1 , 5 , and 20 mjy sr@xmath3 , with rms fluctuations at the 0.1 , 0.1 , and 0.2 mjy sr@xmath3 levels , at 4.5 , 6.75 , and 15 , respectively .",
    "ic 10 was observed twice . in the first set of observations the center of the galaxy",
    "was chosen to be the center of the map , as with the maps for all our other galaxies .",
    "however , we noticed that the mid - infrared emission from ic 10 extended more to the west of center , leaving some interesting structure on the edges of the maps .",
    "a second set of observations was taken a year later to more properly map the mid - infrared emission .",
    "the final set of 6.75 and 15  maps results from a co - add of the maps from the two epochs .",
    "the 11.4  ( lw8 filter ) and 4.5  maps were obtained only in the second epoch .    in the mid - infrared ic 10 appears to consist of a collection of bright knots , except at 4.5  where the galaxy appears to be quite faint .",
    "ic 10 is classified as a barred irregular galaxy but the bar is not apparent in the mid - infrared maps .",
    "there are two wispy arms extending to the north which contain distinct knots of stronger mid - infrared emission .",
    "an overall faint and diffuse mid - infrared emission is detected towards the west and south of the galaxy center , extending almost to the edge of our maps .",
    "a surface brightness analysis of the 6.75 and 15  isocam observations of ic 10 can be found in dale et al .",
    ".      observations for this galaxy were taken in two parts , a western piece and an eastern piece , with the two pieces mosaicked together to make a final map .",
    "the 4.5  observation was taken 5 months later at a different roll angle . in the mid - infrared",
    ", the bar of the galaxy appears as discrete emission sources .",
    "the spiral arms are prominent as both diffuse emission and knots of strong emission .",
    "similar to what is seen optically , there is also a faint wisp of emission directly to the south of galaxy center .",
    "the bright knots of optical emission in the eastern arm also show strongly in the mid - infrared .",
    "our isocam map is unfortunately too small to cover the large star - forming complex just to the southwest of the galaxy ( ryder et al .",
    "the galaxy is barely detected at 4.5 .",

    "ngc 2366 and ngc 6822 are low luminosity irregulars that contain several moderate to supergiant - sized  regions ( hunter et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the mid - infrared maps for these galaxies are of insufficient depth : the 1@xmath8 rms fluctuations in the sky level for ngc 2366 are 0.05 and 0.14 mjy sr@xmath3 at 6.75 and 15 , respectively , while the numbers for ngc 6822 are 0.09 and 0.28 mjy sr@xmath3 . very little",
    "6.75 or 15  emission is detected from these two galaxies , suggesting they contain only a small amount of dust . in ngc 2366",
    "most of the mid - infrared emission coincides with the supergiant  region ngc 2363 in the southwestern part of the galaxy .",
    "there is a much fainter region of emission to the northeast of that which does not obviously correspond to anything in particular in the optical . in ngc 6822 the mid - infrared emissison",
    "is found in four  regions .",
    "there is a bit of diffuse emission towards the center of the galaxy , but it is of too low signal - to - noise to measure with any degree of confidence .",
    "the fluxes given in table [ tab : fluxes ] are the combined fluxes of the  regions ; we caution that these are only estimates of the total flux , as the true sizes of the galaxies in the mid - infrared are difficult to determine .",
    "there are a few foreground stars seen in the 6.75  maps .      at optical wavelengths ,",
    "ngc 6946 is a striking example of a nearly face - on ( @xmath930@xmath10 ) spiral galaxy .",
    "the galaxy is equally rich in detail in the mid - infrared .",
    "the spiral arms can easily be traced in the mid - infrared maps , and each contains several knots of brighter emission .",
    "the ` sharp ' edge of the northeastern - most arm is real and not an artifact of the mosaicking .",
    "it is also seen in  hires maps of ngc 6946 .",
    "preliminary work on ngc  6946 from these isocam observations ( using earlier data reduction techniques ) by helou et al . ( 1996 ) indicated that there is very little mid - infrared color variation throughout the disk of the galaxy .",
    "this result is echoed by the work of tuffs et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who used isophot data to suggest that the bulk of the far - infrared luminosity is due to a uniformly colored and rather cold diffuse emission from the disk .",
    "work by malhotra et al . ( 1996 ) , again using these same isocam observations reduced with prior techniques , showed that the mid - infrared emission is consistent with an exponential disk of scale length of 75 , based on a flux profile computed from the median flux within annuli between 70 and 200 .",
    "they also indicate that the mid - infrared arm - interarm contrast , being close to that observed in @xmath11-band but lower than observed in h@xmath12 , suggests that non - ionizing radiation plays an important role in the heating of the dust .",
    "a surface brightness analysis of the isocam observations for ngc 6946 , using our new reduction methods , can be found in dale et al .",
    "we stress that the main results do not change : the color variations analyzed in dale et al .",
    "are quite close to those presented earlier .",
    "in fact , the small discrepancies ( 10% ) between the two analyses can be taken as a first - order estimate of the uncertainties in the data .",
    "moreover , using the newly - processed data we find a similar mid - infrared disk scale length ( 72 ) .",
    "finally , we point out that the starbursting center is quite bright in the mid - infrared ; our integration times nearly saturated two pixels at 15  and saturated as many as four pixels at 6.75 .",
    "the impact of these saturated and nearly saturated pixels on the overall flux density is measurably small , approximately a 15% ( 25% ) effect at 15 ( 6.75 )  for affected pixels ( the method used to approximate this effect is described in section [ sec : mid - ir_flux ] ) .",
    "our values for the total flux density should be formally taken as lower limits , though the underestimation is no more than a few percent .",
    "before beginning any quantitative analysis on the isocam images presented in figures [ fig : cam_images]-[fig : n6946 ] , we cleaned the images by masking any foreground stars and cosmic ray / transient residuals . to allow direct comparison between the various filters we smoothed the maps to a similar resolution . to do this",
    "we needed to first estimate the approximate resolution for the 6.75 and 15  maps .",
    "there are a few maps which have strong emission from a foreground star ( e.g. ngc 1569 and ngc 6946 ) , and several galaxies appear to be unresolved at these mid - infrared wavelengths (  f10565 , ngc 4418 , ic 860 , ic 883 , cgcg1510.8 + 0725 ,  f23365 + 3604 , markarian 331 ) .",
    "analysis of these images indicate a ( fwhm ) resolution of 7  and 8  at 6.75 at 15 , respectively .",
    "this information was used to convolve the 6.75 and 15  maps , using slightly different gaussian smoothing profiles for each filter , to generate maps with approximately uniform resolution ( 9  fwhm ) . as a final step",
    "the images were registered to the coordinate system of the 15  map by assuming the peak emission at 6.75  is spatially coincident with the peak emission at 15 .",
    "multi - aperture photometry is our preferred method for extracting mid - infrared flux densities . for each galaxy care",
    "is taken to define the apertures and background annulus using the flux density distribution from both the 6.75 and 15  ( and when available the 4.5 ) maps . in each case , a series of evenly spaced , concentric apertures are centered on the central emission peak ( or as in the case of ngc 1569 which has two central emission peaks , the brightest of the central emission peaks ) , with the outermost aperture sized according to the greatest extent of the emission in either map . the background annulus was then defined starting from the outermost aperture , unless a localized contamination ( e.g. star ) warrants starting the background annulus at a slightly larger radius ; the typical background annulus has a width of 15 . the mean value within the background annulus is taken to be the sky background level . as described in section [ sec : cam_images ] ,",
    "the typical rms fluctuation in the background level is 0.10.2 mjy sr@xmath3 .",
    "the background - subtracted flux density within the outermost aperture is the total flux density .",
    "the mid - infrared flux densities and their uncertainties for the galaxies are given in table [ tab : fluxes ] along with the  flux densities .",
    "column 1 in table [ tab : fluxes ] lists the galaxy .",
    "columns 25 list the  flux densities in janskys and columns 67 list the  6.75 and 15  flux densities and their uncertainties in jy ( see  [ sec : cam-12mu ] for a comparison of isocam and  12  fluxes ) .",
    "we assume a 20% uncertainity in the flux density calibration of isocam data ( blommaert & cesarsky 1998 ; biviano 1998 ) . by far",
    ", this uncertainty level dominates any other uncertainties that are introduced by our method of flux density extraction ( e.g. choice of aperture and background annulus , sky rms fluctuation , etc . ) .",
    "however , our finite aperture measurements systematically underestimate the total flux density of the galaxies by a small amount due to the limiting 0.1 mjy sr@xmath3 sensitivity of our observations .",
    "we can estimate the amount of low surface brightness emission that is missed by extrapolating the observed isophotal surface brightness trends .",
    "assuming such trends hold out to a surface brightness of 0.001 mjy sr@xmath3 ( about two disk scale - lengths ) , no more than a few percent of the flux is missing .",
    "overall , for most galaxies we thus find a total flux density uncertainty of 20% ; this number is slightly higher ( 25% ) for about one fourth of the sample due to more significant sky background fluctuations .",
    "the uncertainty is slightly larger in cases where i ) the mid - infrared emission extends beyond the observed target field , or ii ) there is saturation , two additional effects that systematically lower the flux density measure .",
    "only the fluxes for ugc 2855 and ngc 4490 suffer from the former effect ; extrapolations of the observed profiles , as described above , show we are missing @xmath13 5% of such flux for these two galaxies .",
    "a second concern is that observations of a few galaxies saturated the analog to digital converter for a small number of pixels , the effect being more serious for the longer elementary integrations for the 6.75  bandpass .",
    "we have gauged the amplitude of this effect using the known response function of the isocam detectors : the actual flux density should be larger than the initial frame s measure by a factor 1/0.6 ( isocam observer s manual ) . for most of the 11 galaxies exhibiting saturated pixels",
    "the net effect is an underestimate of the total flux density by 6% or less ; the 6.75 and 15  flux densities for ngc 4418 are underestimated by about 15% and 25% , respectively , comparable to the calibration uncertainty level .",
    "the flux densities computed for these galaxies are lower limits and are indicated by a colon in table [ tab : fluxes ] ; they may be assumed to be uncertain at the 25% level .",
    "table [ tab:4.5mu ] lists the total 4.5  flux densities for 13 galaxies in our sample . for ngc  1569",
    "we obtained 2@xmath42 isocam maps in eight filters ; ngc  1569 flux densities and uncertainties are given in table [ tab : n1569 ] .",
    "the typical lw1 flux density uncertainty is 25 - 30% due to a lower overall signal to noise compared to the lw2 and lw3 maps .",
    "lu et al . ( 2000 ) show that the agreement between isophot and isocam lw2 fluxes is better than 20% .",
    "an -independent check of the calibration of our isocam maps can be provided by  data .",
    "figure [ fig : cam-12mu ] presents the ratio of isocam fluxes to  12  fluxes versus   color .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the expected ratios for cirrus ( log  = @xmath14 and log  = @xmath15 for @xmath16 ophiuchi ; w. reach , private communication ) .",
    "the expected cirrus color agrees well with our observed  color ratio : log = @xmath17 ( the uncertainty represents the population dispersion excluding ngc 1155 and ngc 6958 ) .",
    "the agreement is even better for the more quiescent galaxies , even though real galaxies have other emission ( star - formation regions ) in them in addition to cirrus .",
    "moreover , we expect the  color to decrease for warmer galaxies ( relatively high  color ) since the pah features in the 6.75  filter become relatively weak compared to the rising continuum in the 12  band , and this is indeed observed .",
    "photospheres can contribute to the flux at 6.75  and throw off the ratio , especially for measurements of elliptical galaxies .",
    "since this effect does not seem significant in this sample , we conclude that in most of our sample the 6.75  and longer wavelength bands are dominated by interstellar emission . for the  color ratio comparison with cirrus ,",
    "the agreement is not as good , but the ratio observed for galaxies is lower than that of cirrus only by 35% : log = @xmath18 ( excluding ngc 6958 ) .",
    "surprisingly , the offset goes in the wrong direction for astrophysical effects to resolve the discrepancy : the 15  band should pick up more emission in galaxies than the cirrus spectrum represents , and we reach the `` cirrus ratio '' only for mildly active galaxies .",
    "there are a few possible explanations for this discrepancy , most importantly the uncertainty in the cirrus spectrum ( calibration uncertainty and spatial variations in the cirrus behavior ) , the uncertainties in the various filter band passes , and incompleteness in the  flux integral .",
    "the  15  maps are integrated only down to the 0.2 mjy sr@xmath3 isophote , whereas the large angular size of the  detectors tended to pick up contributions from extended diffuse emission .",
    "however , as pointed out in section [ sec : mid - ir_flux ] , extrapolations of the observed surface brightness profiles down to 0.001 mjy sr@xmath3 show we are missing at most 5% of the total  flux . moreover ,",
    "if the problem is  flux incompleteness , we might expect a similar discrepancy in the  comparison ; the  6.75  maps go only slightly deeper , to 0.1 mjy sr@xmath3 .",
    "we conclude that it is unlikely that  flux incompleteness is responsible .",
    "results of the aperture photometry described in section [ sec : mid - ir_flux ] are presented in figures [ fig : curves_of_growth ] and [ fig : curves_of_growth_nearby ] . from the smoothed maps , the curve of growth profiles for the 6.75 and 15  emission",
    "are represented by the solid and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "each profile is flux - normalized to the total flux observed in the respective filters .",
    "the bold , solid vertical line indicates the resolution scale in physical units and corresponds to the 45 hwhm gaussian smoothing profile .",
    "the emission from most galaxies is very well resolved in the maps : for about half ( 45% ) of the galaxies in our sample , 10% or less of the mid - infrared light arises from within the central isocam beam ; one - sixth of the galaxies emit @xmath19 25% in the central beam . while the physical extent and concentration of the mid - infrared emission varies from galaxy to galaxy ,",
    "the 6.75 and 15  profiles are remarkably similar for a given source .    against this general similarity",

    "the most notable cases are ngc 1156 , ngc 1569 , ngc 4519 , ic 4662 , ngc 6958 , and ngc 2366 . as discussed below ( section [ sec : iso - iras ] ) , larger values of  point to more intense heating of the dust , suggesting that the galaxies with this central color enhancement harbor high densities of  regions in their centers , or nuclear starbursts .",
    "this is indeed consistent with the properties of ngc 1156 , ngc 1569 , ic 4662 , and ngc 2366 , which are all magellanic irregulars with bright star - forming regions near their centers ( hunter et al .",
    "2000 ; ho et al .",
    "it is interesting to note that the reverse situation , namely a decrease in the  color , is not observed in this sample .",
    "the  ratio has emerged as an interesting diagnostic of the radiation environment ( helou et al .",
    "1997 ) . as evident in the -  color - color diagram ( figure [ fig : iso - iras ] ) , this ratio remains relatively constant and near unity as the interstellar medium of galaxies proceeds from quiescent to mildly active , where the level of activity is indicated by a rising  ( helou 1986 ) . as dust heating increases",
    "further , the flux at 15  increases steeply compared to 7 . the data plotted in figure [ fig : iso - iras ] are consistent with an inflection in the mean trend occurring near log = @xmath20 , which we interpret as due to excess emission in the 15  band rather than a drop in the 7  band .",
    "the main argument for this interpretation is that the @xmath21m)/fir ratio does not drop as precipitously as  for these objects .",
    "we assign to this emission a characteristic temperature 100 k @xmath22 200 k , since that is the range that would allow a blackbody to contribute considerably to the 15  band but not to the 7  band ; the estimates hold for modified blackbodies as well",
    ". such values of @xmath23 are typical of heating intensities about @xmath24 times greater than the diffuse interstellar radiation field in the solar neighboorhood ( helou et al .",
    "while such a temperature could result from classical dust heated within or just outside  regions , there is no decisive evidence as to the size or location of grains involved or whether in fact they are in equilibrium with the radiation field . it is simpler at this time to associate this component empirically with the observed emission spectrum of  regions and their immediate surroundings ( tran 1998 ; contursi et al . 2000 )",
    "this emission has severely depressed aromatic feature or pah emission , and is dominated by a steeply rising though not quite a blackbody continuum near 15 , consistent with mild fluctuations in grain temperatures , @xmath25 .",
    "this  region hot dust component characterized by color temperatures 100 k @xmath22 200 k becomes detectable in systems where the color temperature from the  ratio is only @xmath26 k ( helou et al . 1988 ) .",
    "this disparity between color temperatures derived from different wavelengths demonstrates the broad distribution of dust temperatures within any galaxy .",
    "the combined data from  and  on these systems are consistent with an extension of the `` two - component model '' of infrared emission ( helou 1986 ) .",
    "the low  ratio is associated with the active component , and combines in a variable proportion with a component with a  near unity ( dale et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "it is interesting to measure the size of a galaxy in the mid - infrared in comparison to an equivalent measure at optical wavelengths , e.g. @xmath27 , the length of the semi - major axis out to 25 mag arcsec@xmath28 in @xmath29 ( obtained from the rc3 catalog ; de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) . using fits of isophotal ellipses to the mid - infrared distribution , we measure semi - major axis lengths from both the 6.75 and 15  maps at several surface brightness levels between 0.2 and 1.0 mjy sr@xmath3 .",
    "we fit elliptical isophotes to the mid - infrared images using both standard and customized iraf packages ( see haynes et al .",
    "1999 for further details on the galphot surface photometry fitting routines ) .",
    "we do not measure sizes at lower surface brightness levels due to s / n constraints , since as discussed in section [ sec : cam_images ] , the typical rms fluctuation in the sky background is @xmath30 mjy sr@xmath3 .",
    "the mid - infrared semi - major axes are corrected for isocam resolution using a quadratic formula @xmath31 .",
    "the open circles in figure [ fig : opt - ir_sizes ] show the mean /  and mean /  for the sample as a function of the mid - infrared surface brightness level at which mid - infrared sizes are measured .",
    "error bars reflect the one sigma population dispersions in the ratios at each surface brightness , divided by the square root of the number of galaxies ; histograms of the ratios at each surface brightness level are also displayed at the top of the figure .",
    "the data are reasonably well approximated by an exponential dependence of mid - infrared surface brightness on radius , and the trend holds for the entire range of measured surface brightness levels . invoking a small extrapolation of the trend to lower surface brightness levels shows that , on average , mid - infrared sizes at 6.75 and 15  match  at a surface brightness level of @xmath32 mjy sr@xmath3 and @xmath33 mjy sr@xmath3 respectively .",
    "the uncertainties in these surface brightness estimates are 25% .    since  is comparable to the location of the sun in the milky way",
    ", one would expect similar values of the mid - infrared surface brightness of the milky way in the local neighborhood . for a typical high galactic latitude  column density of @xmath34 cm@xmath28 ( kulkarni & heiles 1988 ) , and for an emissivity of @xmath36 w per h atom ( boulanger & prault 1988 )",
    ", the expected mid - infrared brightness would be @xmath37 mjy sr@xmath3 , indeed comparable to the values above .",
    "in addition , one can translate the 12  band flux density into expected 6.75 and 15  flux densities using the cirrus spectrum of reach and boulanger ( 1998 ) .",
    "one finds @xmath38 mjy sr@xmath3 and @xmath39 mjy sr@xmath3 , the same numbers we find for the key project sample . in short , the typical mid - infrared emission from the outskirts of normal galaxies is reassuringly similar to what we see in the quiescent regions of the milky way .",
    "we have compared galaxy mid - infrared sizes to their optical sizes , in particular those defined at the 25 @xmath29-mag arcsec@xmath28 level . since",
    "this surface brightness corresponds to 0.018 mjy sr@xmath3 ( assuming @xmath40 jy ) , the observed mid - infrared to @xmath29-band flux ratios at  are @xmath41 in other words , approximately eight ( seven ) times the flux is emitted at the center of the @xmath29-band as compared to the emission at 6.75  ( 15 ) , in the outskirts of normal galaxies .",
    "once again we can contrast this with observations of galactic cirrus",
    ". de vaucouleurs & pence ( 1978 ) estimated the @xmath29-band surface brightness of the galactic disk towards the galactic poles to be @xmath42 mag arcsec@xmath28 .",
    "thus we infer a ratio for the galactic cirrus to be approximately @xmath43 comparable to our results at 6.75 and 15",
    ".    alternatively , it may be more illuminating to compare for quiescent regions the integrated total - infrared flux to the integrated flux in the @xmath29-band . from this comparison",
    "we can infer the ratio of heating output to heating input ( i.e. the total - infrared flux to the uv and optical energy responsible for the dust heating ) . as a start",
    ", we contrast the integrated flux within the lw2 and lw3 bands to that in the @xmath29-band ( @xmath44 ) : @xmath45 note that this is only valid for the outer regions of normal star - forming galaxies . to infer the total - infrared emission for diffuse cirrus regions using only the flux in the lw2 and lw3 bands",
    ", we have to rely on a model for the infrared spectral energy distribution of galaxies .",
    "dale et al . (",
    "2000 ) present such a model for normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "constrained by iras , isocam , and isophot observations for our sample of 69 normal galaxies , the model reproduces well the empirical spectra and infrared color trends .",
    "it also allows us to determine the infrared energy budget for normal galaxies , and of particular interest here , to translate mid - infrared fluxes into total - infrared fluxes .",
    "the model shows that , for cirrus - dominated regions , the total - infrared emission ( from 31100 ) is approximately 10.3 times the emission appearing within just the lw2 and lw3 mid - infrared bands ( and approximately 2.8 times the far - infrared emission from 42122 ) . coupling this result with that expressed by equation [ eq : lw2lw3b ]",
    ", we see that ~5.4 [ eq : fir - b ] in the outskirts of normal galaxies .",
    "observations of cirrus - dominated galaxies show that this finding is representative of quiescent disks : in our sample of normal late - type galaxies , the lowest such integrated total - infrared to blue ratios , assuming tir / fir @xmath46 for the most quiescent regions , are of order 3 . from the above ratio ( equation [ eq : fir - b ] )",
    ", one can derive the ratio of the heating output to the heating input as an indication of the optical depth in the interstellar medium .",
    "this is expected to be significantly less than unity for the most quiescent regions .",
    "all photon energies from the uv to the near - infrared contribute to the heating of dust grains .",
    "in fact , photons responsible for the @xmath29-band flux only contribute about 10 - 15% towards the total far - infrared flux in the outer parts of the disk of m31 , a galaxy well - known for its overall quiescent behavior ( xu & helou 1996 and c. xu personal communication ) .",
    "thus if we assume the results from the outer disk regions of m31 can reasonably apply for the outermost portions of our normal galaxy sample , the ratio of the total heating output to the total heating input for quiescent regions is typically of order 0.7 ( to within a factor of two ) .      the transition from stellar to interstellar emission",
    "is well illustrated by the spectra of virgo cluster galaxies collected by boselli et al .",
    "its precise location and therefore the interpretation to attach to mid - infrared fluxes can be parametrized by the ratio of far - infrared to visible light fluxes .",
    "interstellar dust emission takes over by 5  when the fir / b ratio exceeds 0.5 , and at shorter wavelengths for higher ratios ( see table [ tab : camsample ] for the definition of fir / b ) .",
    "as might be expected , elliptical galaxies are dominated by stellar emission , both photospheric and from circumstellar dust shells , and therefore provide the templates that one subtracts to isolate the interstellar emission component in spiral galaxies ( boselli et al .",
    "1998 ; madden , vigroux & sauvage 1999 ) .",
    "we do not expect large contributions from photospheric emission at 4.5  for our sample in light of the results from mid - infrared isophot spectrophotometry for 45 key project galaxies .",
    "the shape and flux level of the 35  continuum shows no variation with the strength of the aromatic features in emission for galaxies with global far infrared to blue ratios greater than unity ( and very little variation otherwise ) , direct evidence that this portion of the continuum arises primarily from fluctuating dust grain emission ( helou et al .",
    "2000 ; lu et al .",
    "we can similarly explore the nature of the 4.5  emission by analyzing the ratios of broad band fluxes .",
    "figure [ fig:5to7_vs_irtob ] displays the  color ratio as a function of fir / b . gauging by the range of observed  ratios , we can immediately rule out the possibility that the emission at both 4.5 and 6.75  is purely photospheric : the typical logarithmic value for the early type galaxy sample of madden , vigroux & sauvage ( 1999 ) is much higher ( log  @xmath47 0.10.4 ) , consistent with the ratio for a @xmath48 k blackbody profile that has been suggested for the stellar component of normal galaxies ( boselli et al .",
    "thus for our sample of normal galaxies , the average  ratio tells us that the 6.75  emission is definitely dominated by emission from interstellar dust grains , but does not constrain the origin of the 4.5  emission .",
    "the slight trend in the data can tell us more .",
    "first , the trend is in the sense of a `` photospheric excess '' at 4.5  for the galaxies with lower fir / b .",
    "second , the slope of this trend is consistent with the extreme scenario whereby the 4.5  emission is proportional to that in the @xmath29-band , while the 6.75  emission is directly correlated with the far - infrared emission ; the dotted line indicates the ( extinction - corrected ) inverse one - to - one trend .",
    "thus , at first glance it would appear that these data suggest there are photospheric contributions to the 4.5  emission in normal galaxies , at least for those with fir / b @xmath13 1 . the small number of data points , though , limit the robustness of any such claim . finally , if we assume that for higher fir / b ratios ( @xmath49 ) the trend levels off , as the results of helou et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and lu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggest , then the  ratio for the `` pure ism '' is about 0.15 .",
    "we present mid - infrared maps at 6.75 and 15  for 61 normal star - forming galaxies ; for a subset of 13 of these galaxies we also show maps at 4.5 .",
    "all galaxies for which observations were attempted at these wavelengths were successfully detected .",
    "qualitatively , the mid - infrared morphology is not a strong function of wavelength , and many of the optical features of the galaxies are also observed in the mid - infrared , except for the bulges of spiral galaxies , consistent with the findings of helou et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in ngc 6946 .",
    "moreover , the data support non - negligible photospheric contributions at 4.5  for galaxies exhibiting low fir / b ratios , consistent with the conclusion drawn from mid - infrared isophot spectroscopy for normal galaxies ( helou et al .",
    "2000 ; lu et al .",
    "however , the evidence presented here is tenuous , as we only have broad band data at 4.5  for a small number of galaxies .    mid - infrared curve of growth profiles indicate that the mid - infrared emission is very well resolved by the isocam maps for most of these galaxies .",
    "moreover , the profiles are generally exponential in nature , and the distribution of 6.75 and 15  emission is quite similar for most galaxies . however , four of the six galaxies that show an enhanced  color also show signs of active central star formation , with yet greater enhancement of  in the central regions .",
    "quiescent galaxies , those showing low global interstellar heating intensities ( i.e.  @xmath50 ) , have an almost constant  color near unity . for galaxies with higher global heating intensities , the mid - infrared color drops rapidly with increasing far - infrared color .",
    "we interpret this as evidence for global mid - infrared spectral energy distributions that are increasingly dominated by  region emission , characterized by a relatively steep slope in the mid - infrared continuum and a depressed contribution from pahs .",
    "it is interesting to note that galaxies of all morphological types appear to follow the same color - color trend .",
    "we have estimated the average mid - infrared surface brightness at which the mid - infrared semi - major axis matches that in the optical ( at the @xmath29-band 25 mag arcsec@xmath28 level ) .",
    "we find  @xmath51  at 0.04 mjy sr@xmath3 and  @xmath51  at 0.09 mjy sr@xmath3 on average for this sample .",
    "these mid - infrared surface brightness levels are consistent with observations of galactic cirrus and the solar neighborhood , implying a reasonable similarity in interstellar heating intensity for the outskirts of normal galaxies and our galaxy .",
    "a final interesting finding from the mid - infrared size analysis centers on the ratio of total heating output to the total heating input for quiescent regions .",
    "we find that ratio to be of order 0.7 .",

    "<S> in addition , the maps are quite similar at 6.75 and 15 , except for a few cases where a central starburst leads to lower  ratios in the inner region . we also present infrared flux densities and mid - infrared sizes for these galaxies . the mid - infrared color  shows a distinct trend with the far - infrared color . </S>",
    "<S> the quiescent galaxies in our sample (  @xmath0 ) show  near unity , whereas this ratio drops significantly for galaxies with higher global heating intensity levels . </S>",
    "<S> azimuthally - averaged surface brightness profiles indicate the extent to which the mid - infrared flux is centrally concentrated , and provide information on the radial dependence of mid - infrared colors . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxies are mostly well resolved in these maps : almost half of them have @xmath1 10% of their flux in the central resolution element . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of optical and mid - infrared isophotal profiles indicates that the optical flux at 4400   near the optical outskirts of the galaxies is approximately eight ( seven ) times that at 6.75  ( 15 ) , comparable with observations of the diffuse quiescent regions of the milky way . </S>"
