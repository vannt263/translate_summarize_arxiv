    "the jacobian conjecture ( jc ) raised by o.h .",
    "keller in 1939 in @xcite states that a polynomial mapping @xmath19 is invertible if the jacobian determinant @xmath20 is a nonzero constant .",
    "this conjecture has been attacked by many people from various research fields , but it is still open , even for @xmath21 .",
    "only the case @xmath22 is obvious . for more information about the wonderful 70-year history ,",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , and the references therein .",
    "it can easily be seen that the jc is true if the jc holds for all polynomial mappings whose jacobian determinant is 1 .",
    "we make use of this convention in the present paper .    in 1980",
    ", s.s.s.wang ( @xcite ) showed that the jc holds for all polynomial mappings of degree 2 in all dimensions .",
    "the most powerful result is the reduction to degree 3 , due to h.bass , e.connell and d.wright ( @xcite ) in 1982 and a.yagzhev ( @xcite ) in 1980 , which asserts that the jc is true if the jc holds for all polynomial mappings of degree 3 ( what is more , if the jc holds for all cubic homogeneous polynomial mappings ! ) .",
    "it is even shown in @xcite that the condition that @xmath23 is symmetric and @xmath24 is cubic homogeneous is sufficient . in the same spirit of the above degree reduction method , another efficient way to tackle the jc is the drukowski s theorem ( @xcite ) : the jc is true if it is true for all drukowski mappings ( in all dimension @xmath25 ) .",
    "one more interesting result is due to gorni - zampieri ( @xcite ) , who proved in 1997 that there exist gorni - zampieri pairings between the cubic homogeneous polynomial mappings and the drukowski mappings .",
    "recall that @xmath18 is a cubic homogeneous mapping if @xmath26 with @xmath27 the identity ( written as a column vector ) and each component of @xmath24 being either zero or cubic homogeneous .",
    "a cubic homogeneous mapping @xmath26 is a _ * drukowski ( or cubic linear ) mapping * _ if each component of @xmath24 is either zero or a third power of a linear form .",
    "each drukowski mapping @xmath18 is associated to a scalar matrix @xmath28 such that @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the _ * drukowski symbol * _ for the vector @xmath31 with @xmath32 the @xmath33-th row of @xmath28 .",
    "clearly , a drukowski mapping is uniquely determined by this matrix @xmath28 . in section 2 , we prove that the jc is true for drukowski mappings in some cases .    apparently , the notion of a drukowski mapping can be easily generalized .",
    "namely , for any positive integer @xmath34 , we say that @xmath26 is homogeneous power linear of degree @xmath35 if each component of @xmath24 is either zero or a @xmath35-th power of a linear form .",
    "the jc is true in general in case it is true for homogeneous power linear maps of degree @xmath35 , where @xmath35 is any integer larger than two . if @xmath18 is an invertible polynomial map of degree @xmath35 in dimension @xmath12 , the degree of its inverse is at most @xmath36 .",
    "this has been proved in @xcite .",
    "but if additionally @xmath26 is homogeneous power linear of degree @xmath35 such that @xmath4 , then the degree of the inverse of @xmath18 is at most @xmath37 . we will prove this in section 5 , using results of section 3 .    in section 3 ,",
    "we generalize the definition of gz - paired in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we use this to prove in section 4 that the jacobian conjecture in dimension @xmath0 is equivalent to the jacobian conjecture for non - homogeneous power linear maps with @xmath38 and prove the jacobian conjecture is true in this case for @xmath1 under the condition that @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a certain diagonal matrix .",
