    "the anderson impurity model ( aim ) @xcite , reviewed fulsomely in @xcite , remains as topical as ever . while traditionally the archetype for understanding @xcite magnetic impurities in metals , and heavy fermion systems when coherence effects are suppressed by disorder or alloying , study of it has recently acquired further impetus with the advent of quantum dots @xcite , which form directly tunable mesoscopic realizations of the model .    in the strong coupling domain of large local coulomb interaction ( @xmath9 ) ,",
    "the intrinsic low - energy physics of the aim is of course that of the kondo effect @xcite .",
    "manifest dynamically in the many - body kondo resonance arising in the single - particle spectrum @xmath10 , the effect is characterized by a single low - energy kondo scale , @xmath2 . in consequence",
    ", @xmath10 exhibits scaling in terms of @xmath11 alone , with no explicit dependence on bare material parameters .",
    "what then is the form of this universal scaling spectrum ? that the question itself is obvious does not vitiate the difficulties involved in answering it .",
    "conventional perturbation theory can not in general handle strong interactions , necessitating the development of new , non - perturbative theoretical approaches ; the difficulties being particularly acute when dealing with dynamical and transport properties . and",
    "while fermi liquid theory determines the low - frequency form @xcite @xmath12 , such behaviour is limited to the lowest of frequencies @xmath13 , and otherwise provides no clues to the general form of the kondo resonance .",
    "we have recently considered this problem @xcite via the local moment approach ( lma ) @xcite .",
    "this non - perturbative method , naturally approximate but physically and technically quite simple , has been developed to handle a broad class of quantum impurity models , as well as lattice - based problems such as the hubbard or periodic anderson models within the local framework of dynamical mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "for the normal ( metallic host @xcite ) aim considered in @xcite , the lma provides a simple analytical description of the kondo scaling spectrum on all energy scales @xmath11 .",
    "it shows in particular that while fermi liquid behaviour is naturally recovered at sufficiently low frequencies , the scaling spectrum is entirely dominated for @xmath14 by long tails that exhibit a very slow logarithmic decay ; in contrast to either the power - law ( doniach-@xmath15 ) behaviour previously thought to arise from empirical fits to quantum monte carlo @xcite and numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) @xcite calculations , or the simple lorentzian form @xcite inferred from crude extrapolation of low - frequency fermi liquid behaviour . the resultant theory , while naturally approximate , was found @xcite to give very good agreement for essentially all frequencies with recent nrg calculations @xcite .",
    "the above comments refer of course to zero temperature ( @xmath0 ) , and the obvious question is whether the lma can be extended to finite-@xmath0 .",
    "if so , then for the strong coupling kondo regime in particular , the single - particle spectrum @xmath16 should scale universally in terms of @xmath11 _ and _ @xmath17 , with @xmath2 again the @xmath1 kondo scale ; and the approach then affords an analytical handle on the ( @xmath18-differential ) thermal destruction of the kondo resonance .",
    "in addition , and importantly , knowledge of the @xmath0-dependence of the single - particle spectrum enables direct access to transport properties @xcite , notably the resistivity @xmath19 .",
    "it is these issues we consider here , focussing as in @xcite on the symmetric aim , since it is this case whose low - energy physics reduces in strong coupling to the usual kondo model ( with exchange but not potential scattering ) .",
    "the relevant background is introduced in  2 ; and in  3 practical extension of the lma to finite-@xmath0 is considered . for finite interaction strengths @xmath20 ( with @xmath21 the one - electron hybridization ) ,",
    "the lma captures the spectra on all energy scales , including the non - universal hubbard satellites . in ",
    "4 a brief discussion is thus first given of the thermal evolution of the spectrum on all energy scales ; followed by consideration of spectral scaling as the kondo limit is approached with increasing @xmath22 , where a scaling form @xmath23 is correctly recovered .",
    "it is the scaling regime on which we naturally focus in the remainder of the paper , developing an analytical description thereof in  5 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the scaling spectrum in particular , encompassing high - frequencies for all temperatures and _ vice versa _ , is obtained explicitly ; and , as for the @xmath1 limit @xcite , is found to be largely independent of the details of the lma .",
    "the temperature dependence of the resultant lma resistivity , which is found to agree rather well with finite-@xmath22 nrg calculations @xcite , is considered in  6 ; where we show it to be asymptotically exact for @xmath24 @xcite , to agree well with the hamann formula @xcite for the resistivity of the kondo / s - d model down to @xmath7 , and to cross over to characteristic low - temperature fermi liquid form @xcite @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "some closing remarks are given in  7 .",

    "( i ) local moments , regarded as the first effect of electron interactions , are introduced explicitly from the outset @xcite . despite the stark deficiencies of static mean - field theory ( mf ) by itself ( unrestricted hartree - fock )",
    ", it may nevertheless be used as a starting point for a genuine many - body approach encompassing the correlated electron dynamics that are the essence of the kondo effect .",
    "( ii ) to this end the lma invokes a two - self - energy description that is a natural consequence of the underlying _ two _ degenerate , broken symmetry mf states ; introducing non - trivial dynamics into the associated self - energies @xmath44 via coupling of single - particle excitations to low - energy transverse spin fluctuations .",
    "( iii ) the final key element behind the lma for @xmath1 , likewise discussed further below , is that of symmetry restoration : self - consistent restoration of the broken symmetry endemic at mf level .",
    "if symmetry can be restored ( as is always the case for the metallic aim considered here ) , then self - consistent imposition of it reveals the finite timescale @xmath45 on which it occurs ; the associated energy @xmath46 being the kondo scale , whose origin within the lma thus stems directly from symmetry restoration .",
    "the impurity green function is expressed formally as @xcite    [ eq : gdef1 ] g= _ g _    where    [ eq : gdef2 ] g_= [ ^+ - ( ) - ]    ( and @xmath47 or @xmath48 ) .",
    "the corresponding self - energies @xmath49 are separated as    [ eq : sigtdef ] = - u || +    into ( i ) a purely static fock contribution ( with local moment @xmath50 ) that alone would survive at mf level ( the trivial hartree piece of @xmath51 is canceled precisely by @xmath28 ) ; and ( ii ) an @xmath18-dependent contribution @xmath52 containing in particular the spin dynamics that dominate the low - energy physics of the problem . the @xmath53 may be cast equivalently as    [ eq : gfunc ] g_= [ g_()- ]    in terms of the mf propagator    [ eq : scriptg ] g _ ( ) = [ ^+ + u|| - ( ) ] ,    and with @xmath54 $ ] a functional of @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "[ note that the @xmath57 here refer to , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are thus constructed from , ( either ) one of the underlying degenerate mf states ; and that the rotational invariance of the problem is correctly preserved by the ` spin - sum ' as shown directly in @xcite . ] separating the retarded self - energies as    [ eq : sigparts ] = -    analyticity demands that @xmath60 be positive semi - definite for all @xmath18 and @xmath0 ; while p - h symmetry implies    [ eq : phsigsym ] = _ -^i ( -^+;t ) = -_-^r ( -^+;t ) ,    such that ( @xmath61 ) @xmath62 and hence @xmath63 for the impurity spectrum .",
    "for @xmath1 it is of course more natural / convenient to work with time - ordered self - energies , but these are simply related to their retarded counterparts .",
    "we denote the @xmath1 , @xmath64-ordered green functions by @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( for which equations  ( 2.3 ) hold with @xmath67 ) ; and the corresponding self energies by @xmath68 , such that @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath64-ordered and @xmath1 retarded green functions are then related simply by @xmath71 and @xmath72 ; and likewise :    [ eq : t2retsigs ] ( ^+ ; ) = ( ^+ ; ) =    r65 mm    [ fig : diag ]    the lma includes in @xmath73 the non - perturbative class of diagrams shown in figure  1 , that embody dynamical coupling of single - particle excitations to low - energy transverse spin fluctuations .",
    "these capture the spin - flip scattering essential to describe the strong coupling kondo regime for @xmath74 ; while in weak coupling they ensure the lma is perturbatively exact to / including second order in @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "other classes of diagrams may also be included @xcite , but are of minor importance ; retention of the dynamical spin - flip scattering processes is however essential , and it is these on which we focus .",

    "the final step in the lma for @xmath1 @xcite is self - consistent imposition of symmetry restoration ( sr ) , embodied in the condition @xmath78 at the fermi level @xmath79 ; and hence for the p - h symmetric aim ( using equations  ( 2.4,8,9 ) ) by    [ eq : pinning ] ( ( 0^+ ; ) ) ( 0 ) = u || .    for given @xmath22 ,",
    "amounts in practice to a self - consistency equation for the local moment @xmath50 @xcite . in physical terms , its consequences in general are threefold @xcite .",
    "( i ) satisfaction of the sr condition guarantees that the low - energy properties of the system amount to a renormalization of the non - interacting limit , that the system is a fermi liquid with well defined quasiparticle behaviour .",
    "( ii ) most importantly , solution of generates a low - energy spin - flip scale @xmath80 that sets the finite timescale @xmath81 for restoration of the broken symmetry inherent at crude mf level ( stemming in effect from dynamical tunneling between the degenerate mf minima ) .",

    "( iii ) if the sr condition can not be satisfied then a doubly degenerate local moment phase results @xcite : the spin - flip scale @xmath80 = 0 ( as characteristic of the locally degenerate state ) reflecting the fact that the broken symmetry / degeneracy can not be restored ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "this situation does not arise in the metallic aim considered here , where sr is satisfied for all finite @xmath86 .",
    "but it is the self - consistent possibility of such inherent in that enables the lma to access the quantum phase transition from a fermi liquid to a local moment state in problems such as the soft - gap aim @xcite where the non - fermi liquid local moment state arises .    before turning to the lma for finite-@xmath0 we note ( for use in  5 below ) that the conventional single self - energy @xmath87 , defined by @xmath88\\inv$ ] , is readily obtained as a byproduct of the two - self - energy description intrinsic to the lma . using equations  ( 2.3 ) it is given for arbitrary @xmath0 by    [ eq : fullsig ] =    with @xmath89\\inv $ ] the @xmath33 propagator .",
    "to extend the lma to finite temperature we first obtain , and then consider the rather transparent physical content of , the @xmath1 retarded self - energy @xmath90 .",
    "this follows , using equations  ( 2.7,9 ) , from its @xmath64-ordered counterpart @xmath73 ; itself given explicitly by , where the transverse spin polarization propagator therein satisfies the hilbert transform :    [ eq : pihilb ] ^- ( z ) = ^_-     here , @xmath91 for the @xmath64-ordered polarization propagator @xmath92 contained in ( while @xmath93 [ @xmath94 for the corresponding @xmath1 retarded propagator @xmath95 ) ; and @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) is the corresponding spectral density of transverse spin excitations , such that @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xcite .",

    "the natural extension of the lma to finite-@xmath0 may now be deduced by considering the physical processes to which the two terms in for @xmath1 correspond .",

    "the latter generates an on - site @xmath111 spin - flip , which is a hard core boson in the sense that at most one spin - flip can be created on the impurity ; and the ( @xmath1 ) probability with which the @xmath109-spin can be added to / hop into ( empty ) conduction band states is @xmath112 .",

    "this corresponds physically to processes in which ( for @xmath102 ) an originally present @xmath110-spin on the impurity is first removed , and an @xmath109-spin electron then hops from the conduction band onto the impurity .",

    "extension of this contribution to finite - t is then achieved by replacing @xmath115 with @xmath120 in for @xmath102 ; with @xmath121 the finite-@xmath0 probability with which an @xmath109-spin electron can be removed from the conduction band to hop onto the impurity , thereby generating the on - site spin - flip .    the finite-@xmath0 lma we consider is thus given from the above by    [ eq : retsig1 ] = u^2 _ 2   ( _ 1;t )   g(_1;_2 )    with    [ eq : retsig2 ] g(_1;_2 ) = ( _ 1)[1 - f(_2;t ) ] + ( -_1)f(_2;t ) .",

    "@xmath126 likewise follows from equation  ( 3.5 ) by inverting all spins ( @xmath127 , @xmath128 ) or , in the symmetric case of interest , from p - h symmetry .",
    "we note that equation  ( 3.5 ) is not what arises if one attempts to obtain the appropriate lma @xmath52 via a conventional analytical continuation of the corresponding imaginary time @xmath129 . in that case",

    "this corresponds physically to treating the impurity spin - flips as _ free _ bosons , with thermal statistics that are entirely divorced from those of the fermions . in generating multiple",
    "thermally created spin - flips , it thus in effect violates the hard core condition for the bosonic spin - flips  whose probability of creation is dictated by the ( @xmath0-dependent ) probability with which fermions can hop to / from the impurity from / to the conduction band , as embodied in equation  ( 3.5 ) .",
    "the hard core constraint can however be recovered simply by replacing the free bose function @xmath134 in @xmath135 by its @xmath1 limit @xmath136 : in that case @xmath135 reduces precisely to @xmath131 , and equation  ( 3.5 ) for @xmath137 is recovered .",
    "we do not know what _",
    "additional _ diagrams may be required to recover hard core behaviour within the framework of a conventional analytical continuation ; but believe that the physical arguments given above , together with the results of the following sections , attest to the essential validity of equation  ( 3.5 ) as used in practice for the lma @xmath52 .",
    "the finite-@xmath0 lma is readily implemented . the retarded @xmath30 ( and hence @xmath138 )",

    "the finite-@xmath0 retarded polarization propagator entering ( such that @xmath141 ) is calculated in practice for finite @xmath22 at the level of the rpa - like p - h ladder sum , obtained by straightforward analytical continuation of the imaginary time @xmath142\\inv$ ] ( cf ) .",
    "finally , it is also straightforward to include a @xmath0-dependence for the local moment @xmath143 entering the mf propagators ( ) and the lma self - energies ( ) .",

    "we find however that the resultant @xmath0-dependence is negligible for essentially all @xmath22 ( provided one is not concerned with temperatures on the order of @xmath9 ) , and we thus omit it from the results shown explicitly in ",
    "the primary interest in single - particle dynamics resides of course in thermal destruction of the low - energy kondo resonance , particularly in the strong coupling kondo / spin - fluctuation regime where the aim maps onto the kondo or s - d model .",
    "that is our main focus , and is pursued in the following sections .",
    "first however , we consider the issue of spectral scaling as the kondo limit is approached with increasing @xmath22 ; preceded by a brief discussion of the thermal evolution of the spectrum on all energy scales .",
