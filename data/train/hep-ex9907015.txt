    "the @xmath8 chorus apparatus combines a 770 kg nuclear emulsion target with various electronic detectors : a scintillating fibre tracker system , trigger hodoscopes , an air - core magnet , a lead / scintillator calorimeter and a muon spectrometer .",
    "details about the experimental setup and the performances of the sub - detectors can be found in  @xcite .",
    "in the 1994 - 1997 period , chorus has collected 2,271,000 triggers corresponding to @xmath9 protons on target . of these",
    ", 458,601 have a muon identified in the final state ( the so - called @xmath10 events ) and 116,049 do not ( the so - called @xmath11 events ) and a vertex position compatible with one of the four emulsion target stacks .",
    "all tracks , associated to the interaction vertex , with an angle smaller than 0.4 rad from the beam axis and bigger than 0.05 rad from the direction of a secondary beam nearby are selected for further analysis .",
    "the second requirement avoids possible confusion arising from the large emulsion background of muons originating from this beam .",
    "the selected tracks are searched for in the emulsion if their charge is negative and their momentum is in the range @xmath12  gev / c and @xmath13  gev / c for hadrons and muons , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that the energy deposition in the calorimeter has not been used to select electrons or unidentified muons .",
    "however the small contribution of the @xmath14 leptonic decay modes to the @xmath11 data sample is taken into account in the evaluation of the sensitivity .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      the sps neutrino beam contains a @xmath15 component which amounts to 0.9% of the integrated @xmath16 flux .",
    "the negative result of the search for @xmath1 interactions can therefore be used to set limits on the @xmath4 oscillation .",
    "the evaluation of the limit has been performed with the technique described in section 5.2 , with the replacement of the energy dependent @xmath17 flux by the @xmath18 flux .",
    "the difference between the @xmath16 and @xmath15 energy spectra -  the average energy of @xmath15 component is 20  gev higher  - leads to differences in the acceptance for @xmath19 interactions . in the case of the @xmath15 beam",
    ", the increase of the cross - section with energy improves the sensitivity to @xmath20 interactions , while the kinematic cuts and reconstruction inefficiencies affecting high energy events contribute to lower the acceptance .    using the present sample the following 90% c.l .",
    "limit is obtained    @xmath21    the 90% c.l .",
    "excluded region in the ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) parameter space is shown in figure  [ fig : excle ] .",
    "maximum mixing between @xmath15 and @xmath19 is excluded at 90% c.l . for @xmath24 ; the large @xmath25 are excluded at 90% c.l . for @xmath26 .",
    "the emulsion scanning methods , previously described in  @xcite , have been applied to a fraction of the 1994 - 1997 data .",
    "no @xmath14 decay candidate has been found , leading to a more stringent 90% c.l .",
    "upper limit on the @xmath0 oscillation probability ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "based on the same statistics , the 90% c.l .",
    "upper limit on the @xmath4 oscillation probability is @xmath28 .",
    "the dominant background to the @xmath2 search is due to `` white kink '' secondary interactions in the @xmath11 channel .",
    "a direct measurement of this background process is in progress and kinematic cuts are planned for its reduction .",
    "furthermore , a second phase of the analysis ( with better efficiencies , larger statistics and faster automatic emulsion scanning ) has started with the aim of reaching the design sensitivity @xmath29  @xcite .",
