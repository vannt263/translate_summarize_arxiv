    "a unique feature of two - component bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) is the possibility for two superfluids to flow with different velocities .",
    "the properties of such systems can be described by the three - velocity hydrodynamics ( one normal and two superfluid velocities ) .",
    "this feature was already noticed by khalatnikov @xcite .",
    "the modern three - velocity superfluid hydrodynamic theory was formulated in the paper by andreev and bashkin @xcite . as was shown in @xcite the specifics of the three - velocity superfluid hydrodynamics",
    "is the presence of a non - dissipative drag between the components .",
    "the drag effect emerges at nonzero relative velocity of the components and consists in a dependence of the superfluid current of one component on the gradient of the phase of the order parameter of the other component .",
    "the microscopic theory of the non - dissipative drag effect was developed in @xcite .",
    "an important question that arises in the three - velocity superfluid hydrodynamics is the question on critical velocities . at equal velocities of the components",
    "the answer to this question can be obtained from the galilean transformation .",
    "it yields that under neglecting of vortex excitations the critical velocity coincides with the minimal phase velocity of the lower bogolyubov mode . in a wider sense",
    "one can introduce two critical velocities @xmath1 and @xmath2 , one is for the lower mode and the other is for the upper mode @xcite .    in case of unequal velocities of the components",
    "the situation becomes more complicated .",
    "the question was considered in refs .",
    "the authors of @xcite have obtained the dispersion equation for the spectrum of elementary excitations in the presence of superfluid flows . however the analysis of critical velocities in @xcite was based on the implication that the landau criterium can be formulated as the condition on the relative velocity of the superfluid components .",
    "such an implication can be put in question since there are two independent relative velocities in the three - velocity theory . in @xcite",
    "the landau criterium was formulated as the condition of positiveness of energies of elementary excitations in a reference frame connected with a normal component .",
    "it yields a joint condition on absolute values of the superfluid velocities of the components and on the angle between their directions .",
    "if one component is at rest the superfluidity condition @xcite is reduced to @xcite .",
    "the analysis carried out in @xcite shows that the landau criterium may be fulfilled if one or even both superfluid velocities exceed the velocity of the lower mode @xmath1(in the latter case the velocities should have different directions ) . in view of unusual behaviour of critical velocities in such systems",
    "it is interesting to consider how this behavior can reveal itself in experiments .",
    "two - component becs have been realized experimentally in ultracold alkali metals gases confined in magnetic and magneto - optical traps .",
    "two components may correspond to different hyperfine zeeman states of the same isotope @xcite , or to different isotopes @xcite .",
    "one of the methods to determine critical velocities for trapped ultracold gases consists in the observation of density excitations induced by some object moving through the condensate @xcite ( usually a laser beam is used as such an object ) .",
    "a motion of an object in a two - component gas with nonzero relative velocity of the superfluid components corresponds to the general case of the three - velocity hydrodynamics .",
    "the bogolyubov spectrum has a dispersion .",
    "therefore , a motion of an object through a superfluid system ( or a superfluid flow past an obstacle ) can lead to an occurrence of stationary waves ( the waves whose crests remain at rest relative to the obstacle ) .",
    "such an effect called `` ship waves '' is well - known @xcite .",
    "it was considered by kelvin for the waves generated on a water surface by a ship moving in a deep water .",
    "stationary waves in a one - component quasi - two - dimensional bec were studied in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that in a superfluid that flows past a point obstacle ( the obstacle size is less than the healing length ) the stationary wave pattern is similar to one for stationary capillary waves .",
    "the effect takes place if the superfluid velocity @xmath3 exceeds the minimal phase velocity of the bogolyubov mode @xmath4 .",
    "the stationary waves arise outside the mach cone bounded by arms directed at the angles @xmath5 relative to the flow .    in recent papers the solitons @xcite and stationary waves",
    "@xcite induced by an obstacle in a two - component superfluid system were studied ( the paper @xcite was published as the electronic preprint when the present study was almost completed ) .",
    "but the authors of @xcite considered only the case of equal superfluid velocities ( a relative velocity of the components is equal to zero ) .    in the present paper we put emphasis on the general case of nonzero relative velocity . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we obtain the equation for the spectrum and the eigenvectors of collective excitations and define two more critical velocities ( in addition to @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "one of them is the maximum critical velocity @xmath6 for a given component ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the superflow at the velocity @xmath8 can be reached if the other component is at rest .",
    "the other is the relative critical velocity @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "if the relative velocity exceeds @xmath11 , the frequency of the lower mode becomes complex valued .",
    "the latter signals for an instability of the two - component system with respect to a spatial separation of the components . in sec.[sec3 ] the equation that describes the stationary wave pattern is obtained .",
    "it is shown that the stationary waves emerge if the landau criterium of superfluidity is violated ( the energies of the excitations with certain wave vectors becomes negative ) , but the system remains stable with respect to the spatial separation ( the critical relative velocity is not achieved ) .",
    "a number of stationary wave patterns are presented .",
    "it is shown that depending on the velocities of the components several qualitatively different situations are possible .",
    "if the velocities are the same in modulus and in direction , one set of stationary waves appears at @xmath12 , and another set adds at @xmath13 .",
    "the phase separation does not occur .",
    "if only one component moves with the velocity @xmath3 , one set of stationary waves is formed at @xmath14 but if @xmath3 reaches @xmath9 the phase separation occurs .",
    "if the velocities are equal in modulus and the angle between their directions is @xmath0 or close to @xmath0 two or three sets of stationary waves occur at @xmath15 . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we investigate the structure of the stationary waves .",
    "the densities of the components always oscillate out - of - phase in the waves that correspond to the lower mode .",
    "the ratio of the amplitudes of the oscillations of the components depends on the relative velocity and varies along the crests of the waves . for complex density patterns where two or three waves interfere the density plots are presented .",
    "it is established that the stationary waves are visible in total density images as well as relative density images , but in most cases relative density images are more contrast .",
    "the only exception is the stationary waves that are exited at @xmath13 and correspond to the upper bogolyubov mode .",
    "to analyze the stationary waves in a two - component superfluid system one should obtain the collective modes spectrum in a moving condensate . it can be found from the matrix version of the gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the wave functions of the components , @xmath18 are the masses of the particles , @xmath19 are the interaction constants ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 are scattering lengthes ) .    here",
    "we restrict the consideration by the most convenient for the analysis symmetric case for which the components have equal masses of the particles @xmath22 , equal densities @xmath23 of the components and equal interaction constants @xmath24 . while this case is quite specific , it is possible to produce equal @xmath25 using a feshbach resonance .",
    "the symmetric case may also correspond to two quasi two - dimensional bose clouds with a strong dipole interaction separated by a rather high ( but thin ) barrier that suppress the tunneling ( see @xcite ) . on the qualitative level",
    "the results obtained for the symmetric case hold for the general case where such a symmetry between the components is broken .",

    "cherenkov radiation arises when the velocity of a radiating object in the medium exceeds the phase velocity of radiated waves in this medium . in this respect",

    "the answer is the following . at relative motion of the components",
    "the eigenvector for the lower mode differs from one for the condensate at rest or at @xmath172 . in other words , in the flow with @xmath173 the structure of the modes is modified , and the mode radiated at nonzero relative velocity is not the @xmath1 lower bogolyubov mode .",
    "in conclusion , the properties of stationary waves arising in a flow of a two - component bec past an obstacle have been studied .",
    "the problem was considered for a special case of the symmetric two - component system ( with the components of equal masses of the particles , equal densities and equal interaction constants )",
    ". nevertheless , the majority of conclusions are applicable also to the cases in which such a symmetry between the components is absent .",
    "let us recite these conclusions .    in a two - component flowing superfluid system the energies of the excitations can take on not only negative , but complex values . at reaching of negative values the landau criterium",
    "is broken , and at reaching of complex values the system becomes unstable with respect to a spatial separation .",
    "the landau criterium is a joint condition of both superfluid velocities ( and the angle between them ) in the lab reference frame .",
    "the stability condition with respect to a spatial separation is a condition solely on an absolute value of the relative velocity ( which does not depend on the reference frame ) . in case of equal ( in modulus and in direction ) velocities of the components",
    "a spatial separation does not arise at any velocities .",
    "under increase of the velocities the landau criterion is broken first , and then the stability condition is broken .",
    "stationary waves arise when the landau criterion is already broken , but the system remains stable with respect to a spatial separation . at equal velocities the stationary waves generated by the lower and the upper modes can arise .",
    "if only one component flows , the one set of stationary waves ( corresponding to the lower mode ) may emerge .",
    "if the angle between the velocities is close to @xmath174 , two sets of stationary waves can arise , and both of them correspond to the lower mode . in general , the stationary waves are visible at the total density and relative density images .",
    "we did not consider here the ways of creation of relative flow of the components in two - component atomic vapors , but we would like to mention some other possibilities .",
    "it is quite simple to realize such a flow for two components separated with a thin barrier . in this case",
    "the interaction between the components should contain a long - range ( for example , dipole ) part .",
    "strictly speaking , in such systems the spectrum of excitations may differ from ( [ 42 ] ) ( due to a long - range interaction ) .",
    "nevertheless one can expect that the stationary waves will behave qualitatively the same as in the case considered in this paper .",
