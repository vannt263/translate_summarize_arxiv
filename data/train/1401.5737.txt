    "cmb anisotropies generated at the last scattering surface ( lss ) propagating towards the present observer are inevitably distorted by the perturbed metric of the intervening spacetime .",
    "such distortions generate higher - order fluctuations which include _ lensing _ , _ redshift _ and _ time - delay effects_. among these non - linear effects , weak lensing has the most significant impact on the cmb .",
    "cmb lensing was first considered in 1987 @xcite and , since then ( for a review , see @xcite ) its contributions to the power spectra @xcite , bispectra @xcite and trispectra @xcite of the cmb temperature and polarizations have been studied .",
    "recently , the first detection of the cmb lensing was achieved by cross - correlating the lensing potential reconstructed by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data and large scale structure surveys ( as suggested in @xcite ) @xcite .",
    "the detection of the power spectrum of the lensing potential was first obtained with the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) data @xcite and then with the south pole telescope ( spt ) data @xcite .",
    "the first full - sky map of the lensing potential was reconstructed by the planck data @xcite and the significance of the detection has been boosted to larger than @xmath0 .",
    "planck also detected the isw - lensing bispectrum generated by the non - gaussian lensed cmb temperature fluctuations with significance of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "finally , the b - mode polarization induced by lensing was detected with the sptpol data @xcite at @xmath4 significance .",
    "driven by these sophisticated experiments , the study of the cmb lensing has entered a new era with unprecedented precision .    in particular ,",
    "since its major contribution comes from lenses at low redshifts ( @xmath5 ) , this effect is very sensitive to the late - time evolution of the universe . by using the non - gaussian properties of the lensing effect on the cmb temperature and polarizations , different estimators @xcite",
    "were proposed to reconstruct the lensing power spectrum from the cmb data .",
    "measuring the lensing power spectrum with high angular resolution and high sensitivity imposes constraints @xcite on the neutrino masses @xmath6 with @xmath7 as small as 0.035 ev @xcite , which are much tighter compared to the one using the cmb power spectra alone and have fewer biasing issues compared to the constraints from the large - scale structure .",
    "the lensing power spectrum can also break the degeneracy between the neutrino masses and the equation of state parameter @xmath8 of the dark energy @xcite .",
    "the cross - correlations between the reconstructed lensing potential and other late - time observations have been analyzed through various experiments @xcite .",
    "these cross - correlations allow us to constrain the dynamics of the dark matter and the dark energy @xcite .    in view of these applications of the cmb lensing ,",
    "it is clear that an accurate computation of the lensing effect is required . in particular",
    ", it remains to be articulated the _ approximations _ involved in the usual lensing calculation .",
    "for example , in the canonical approach @xcite , the lensed cmb temperature anisotropies @xmath9 are expressed in terms of the unlensed cmb temperature anisotropies @xmath10 in the remapping @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the direction in the sky , and the deflection angle @xmath13 is a perturbation defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is known as the _ lensing potential _ , @xmath16 is the weyl potential , @xmath17 is the conformal distance between the gravitational potential and the observer , @xmath18 is the conformal distance between the lss and the observer , and @xmath19 is the covariant derivative on the sphere .",
    "the usual derivation of this equation using a perturbed geodesic employs some implicit approximations .",
    "while there are assessments about the fidelity of the corrections of the remapping approach especially in high orders @xcite , keeping correction terms consistently in high orders is non - trivial @xcite and a _",
    "systematic _ study in arbitrarily high orders has not been undertaken .    in this paper",
    ", we intend to fill this gap . in our approach , instead of a remapping , we _ derive the lensing effect by solving the boltzmann equation to arbitrarily high orders_. in addition to encoding the geometrical information implicit in the use of the geodesic equations , our approach using the boltzmann equation also manifestly contains additional interactions , such as redshift effects and compton scattering .",
    "we will demonstrate how these effects couple with lensing in high orders . we will explicitly re - derive eqn .",
    "( [ mappingequation ] ) and identify the implicit approximations used in the remapping approach .",
    "one of the primary benefits of our approach is that the meaning of each physical term is clear and unambiguous .",
    "although the focus of this paper is to establish the formalism and we leave the quantitative assessments of the approximations in the future , we will show how our approach facilitates the identification of the dominant effects in high orders . as an application",
    ", we calculate the corrections to the temperature power spectrum from lens - lens couplings in section [ validapprox ] .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ secformalism ] ,",
    "we perturb the metric and express the @xmath20th - order intensity matrix of the cmb photons as a time integration of the @xmath20th - order source function .",
    "the expression is valid as long as the perturbation theory holds .",
    "we then demonstrate the formalism in 2nd order and identify the approximation needed in order to recover the remapping approach in 2nd order .",
    "finally , we generalize the formalism to arbitrarily high orders and again recover the remapping approach . in section [ validapprox ] ,",
    "we present a systematic and diagrammatic approach to represent all possible coupling terms in high orders . focusing on the corrections from lens - lens couplings ,",
    "we illustrate how these diagrams can facilitate the calculation of the lensing effects on the cmb power spectra .",
    "we discuss some limitations and possible extensions of the current work in section [ secdiscussion ] and conclude in section [ secconclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we construct the coordinate system for the manifold and the tetrad basis for the tangent planes used in this paper .",
    "the construction allows us to expand the perturbations consistently to any orders .",
    "we then define the intensity matrix which embeds the intensity and the polarizations of the cmb photons .",
    "after that , we derive the weak lensing effect from the 2nd - order boltzmann equation and generalize the derivation to arbitrarily high orders to establish the complete formalism .",

    "the cmb lensing is clearly not a local effect and its gr corrections may be important .",
    "further assessment is needed in the future .",
    "in this paper , we present a new formalism to calculate the lensing effect by directly solving the boltzmann equation .",
    "this allows us to explicitly keep track of _ all known physical effects _ through the entire time of flight of a cmb photon from recombination to the present observer . using this formalism and focusing on temperature anisotropies , we explicitly articulate the approximations required to recover the usual remapping approach used in current studies of the cmb lensing .",
    "we discover two new approximations which have not been studied previously although we do not expect that they contribute significantly under the current limits from observations .",
    "in addition , we calculate the correction to the cmb temperature power spectrum for the _ lens - lens _ coupling effects and find that the correction is @xmath1 for @xmath2 up to 3000 .",
    "it is comparable to the cosmic variance and should be taken into account as systematics .",
    "moreover , since the lensing effect integrates over a time scale comparable to the hubble radius , this may raise significant gr corrections which have to be examined in the future .",
    "similar formalism can be established for the cmb polarizations . due to the weak b - mode signals",
    ", we expect that the corrections on the b - mode polarization should be stronger compared to that on the cmb temperature in terms of percentage .",
    "these corrections may have a significant impact on searches of the primordial b - mode in future experiments , and hence require an accurate assessment .",
    "finally , we remark that our formalism can be extended to the calculation of weak lensing effects on galaxies by replacing the cmb source terms with the background galaxy power spectrum and hence generalizing the approach of @xcite .",
