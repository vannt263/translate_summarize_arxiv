    "this work discusses the application of fisher s information measure to some scale - invariant phenomena .",
    "we thus begin our considerations with a brief review of the pertinent ingredients .",
    "the study of scale - invariant phenomena has unravelled interesting and somewhat unexpected behaviours in systems belonging to disciplines of different nature , from physical and biological to technological and social sciences  @xcite .",
    "indeed , empirical data from percolation theory and nuclear multifragmentation  @xcite reflect scale - invariant behaviour , and so do the abundances of genes in various organisms and tissues  @xcite , the frequency of words in natural languages  @xcite , scientific collaboration networks  @xcite , the internet traffic  @xcite , linux packages links  @xcite , as well as electoral results  @xcite , urban agglomerations  @xcite and firm sizes all over the world  @xcite .    the common feature in these systems is the lack of a characteristic size , length or frequency for an observable @xmath0 at study .",
    "this lack generally leads to a power law distribution @xmath1 , valid in most of the domain of definition of @xmath0 , @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "special attention has been paid to the class of universality defined by @xmath4 , which corresponds to zipf s law in the cumulative distribution or the rank - size distribution  @xcite .",
    "recently , maillart et al .",
    "@xcite have studied the evolution of the number of links to open source software projects in linux packages , and have found that the link distribution follows zipf s law as a consequence of stochastic proportional growth . in its simplest formulation ,",
    "the stochastic proportional growth model , or namely the geometric brownian motion , assumes the growth of an element of the system to be proportional to its size @xmath0 , and to be governed by a stochastic wiener process .",
    "the class @xmath4 emerges from the condition of stationarity , i.e. , when the system reaches a dynamic equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "together with geometric brownian motion , there is a variety of models arising in different fields that yield zipf s law and other power laws on a case - by - case basis  @xcite , as preferential attachment  @xcite and competitive cluster growth  @xcite in complex networks , used to explain many of the scale - free properties of social , technological and biological networks .",
    "much effort has recently been devoted to fisher s information measure ( fim ) , usually denoted as @xmath5 . the work of frieden and co - workers  @xcite , silver  @xcite , and plastino et al .",
    "@xcite , among many others , has shed much light upon the manifold physical applications of @xmath5 . as a small sample",
    "we mention that frieden and soffer have shown that fim provides a powerful variational principle , called epi ( extreme physical information ) that yields the canonical lagrangians of theoretical physics  @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xmath5 has been proved to characterize an arrow of time with reference to the celebrated fokker - planck equation  @xcite .",
    "moreover , there exist interesting relations that connect fim and the relative shannon information measure invented by kullback  @xcite .",
    "these can be shown to have some bearing on the time evolution of arbitrary systems governed by quite general continuity equations  @xcite . additionally , a rather general @xmath5-based h theorem has recently been proved  @xcite . as for hamiltonian systems",
    "@xcite , epi allows to describe the behaviour of complex systems , as the allometric or power laws found in biological sciences  @xcite .",
    "the pertinent list could be extended quite a bit .",
    "@xmath5 is then an important quantity , involved in many aspects of the theoretical description of nature . for our present purposes",
    "it is of the essence to mention that frieden et al .  @xcite",
    "have also shown that equilibrium and non - equilibrium thermodynamics can be derived from a principle of minimum fisher information , with suitable constraints ( mfi ) . here",
    "@xmath5 is specialized to the particular but important case of _ translation families _ ,",
    "i.e. , distribution functions whose form does not change under translational transformations . in this case , fisher measure becomes _ shift - invariant_. it is shown in  @xcite than such minimizing of fisher s measure leads to a schrdinger - like equation for the probability amplitude , where the ground state describes equilibrium physics and the excited states account for non - equilibrium situations .",
    "scale - invariant phenomena are generally addressed by appeal to ad - hoc models ( see the references citing in 1.1 ) . in spite of the success of these models ,",
    "the intrinsic complexity involved therein makes their study at a macroscopic level a rather difficult task .",
    "one sorely misses a general formulation of the thermodynamics of scale - invariant physics , which is not quite established yet .",
    "it is our goal here to show , in such a vein , that minimization of fisher information provides a unifying framework that allows these phenomena to be understood as arising from an mfi variational principle , entirely analogous to how termodynamics is generated in [ 34 ] .",
    "the fisher information measure @xmath5 for a system described by a set of coordinates @xmath6 and physical parameters @xmath7 , has the form  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the density distribution in a configuration space ( @xmath6 ) of volume @xmath10 conditioned by the physical parameters ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the constants @xmath11 account for dimensionality , and take the form @xmath12 if @xmath13 and @xmath14 are uncorrelated .",
    "the equilibrium state of the system minimizes @xmath5 subject to prior conditions , like the normalization of @xmath15 or any constraint on the mean value of an observable @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the mfi is then written as a variation problem of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 are appropriate lagrange multipliers .      because of the nature of the systems to be addressed we consider now a one - dimensional system with a physical parameter @xmath19 and a discrete coordinate @xmath20 where @xmath21 for a certain value of the interval @xmath22 .",
    "this scenario arises , for instance , in the case of nuclear multifragmentation  @xcite , the abundances of genes  @xcite , the frequency of words  @xcite , scientific collaboration networks  @xcite , the internet traffic  @xcite , linux packages links  @xcite , electoral results  @xcite , urban agglomerations  @xcite , firm sizes  @xcite , etc .    in the continuous limit ( @xmath23 ) , the fisher information measure is cast as @xmath24 instead of using translation invariance  la frieden - soffer  @xcite , we will appeal to scaling invariance  @xcite so that we can anticipate some new physics .",
    "all members of the family @xmath25 possess identical shape there are no characteristic size , length or frequency for the observable @xmath0 namely @xmath26 under the transformation @xmath27 .    to deal with this new symmetry",
    "it is convenient to change to the new coordinate @xmath28 and parameter @xmath29 .",
    "because then the scale invariance becomes again translational invariance , and we are entitled to use one essential result of [ 34 ] , namely , that mfi leads to a schroedinger - like equation .",
    "note that the new coordinate @xmath30 transforms as @xmath31 . defining @xmath32 and taking into account the fact that the jacobian of the transformation is @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the fisher information measure acquires now the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 , and the factor @xmath37 guaranties the invariance of the associated cramer - rao inequality as shown in  @xcite .    for reasons that will become apparent below",
    ", we will apply the mfi without any constraint .",
    "this is tantamount to posing no bound to the physical `` sizes '' that characterize the system .",
    "the extremization of fisher information with no constraints ( @xmath38 ) is written as @xmath39 introducing @xmath40 , and varying with respect to @xmath41 and @xmath42 as in  @xcite one is easily led to a ( real ) schrdinger - like equation of the form @xmath43\\psi(u)=0.\\ ] ] notice that the lack of normalization constraints implies zero eigenvalue , since the lagrange multiplier associated with the normalization is the energy eigenvalue  @xcite . at this point",
    "we introduce boundary conditions to guaranty convergence of the fisher measure ( [ f2 ] ) and thus compensate for the lack of constraints in ( [ vargii ] ) .",
    "we impose @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is an dimensionless constant the meaning of which will become clear later .",
    "the solution to ( [ schr ] ) with these boundary conditions is @xmath47 , which leads to @xmath48 and to the density distribution @xmath49 with @xmath50 for a density normalized to unity .",
    "this distribution is just the zipf s law ( universal class @xmath4 ) of refs .  @xcite .",
    "this result is remarkable : _",
    "zipf s law has been here derived from first principles_.",
    "a common representation of empirical data is the so - called rank - plot or zipf plot  @xcite , where the @xmath51th element of the system is represented by its size , length or frequency @xmath52 against its rank , sorted from the largest to the smallest one .",
    "this process just renders the inverse function of the ensuing cumulative distribution , normalized to the number of elements .",
    "we call @xmath53 the rank that ranges from 1 to @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the constant @xmath46 arising from the boundary conditions is the total number of elements considered in building up the distribution ( [ zip ] ) , as will be illustrated in the examples bellow .",
    "this rank - distribution takes the form @xmath54 which yields a straight line in a logarithmic representation with slope @xmath55 .    in fig .",
    "1a we depict the known behavior  @xcite of the rank size distribution for the top 100 largest cities of the united states  @xcite , which shows a slope near @xmath55 ( @xmath4 ) in the logarithmic representation of the rank - plot .",
    "we have also studied the system formed by the most referenced physics journals  @xcite , using their total number of cites as coordinate @xmath0 .",
    "if a journal receives more cites due to its popularity , it becomes even more popular and , therefore , receives still more cites , etc . under such conditions ,",
    "proportional growth and scale invariance are expected , as we depict in fig .  1b , where the slope s value can be regarded as illustrating the universality of the underlying law .",
    "we have here shown that zipf s law results from the scaling invariance of the crammer - rao inequality derived in [ 35 ] .",
    "this entails that the relevant probability distribution , usually called the rank - distribution , has to be size - invariant .",
    "consequently , it should be derivable from a minimization process in which fisher s information measure is the protagonist .",
    "no constraints are needed in the concomitant variational problem because , a priori , our sizes have no upper bound .",
    "a physical analogy is the non - normalizability of plane waves .",
    "the universal character of our demonstration thus resides in the universal form to be minimized ( fisher s ) , with no constraints .",
    "we would like to thank m. barranco , r. frieden , and b. h. soffer for useful discussions .",
