    "the ocean cools relatively slowly in xte  j1701 - 462 , due to its larger impurity parameter of @xmath75 , taking @xmath82 to cool completely much longer than maxi  j0556 - 332  and mxb  1659 - 29 .    , and @xmath84 panel ( a ) : fundamental @xmath2 , @xmath3 @xmath0-mode  frequency in the ocean ( equation  4 ) .",

    "in this study , we investigate the thermal evolution of the transient z - sources to characterize the temporal evolution of the ocean @xmath0-modes  during outburst and quiescence .",
    "before accretion begins , the predicted fundamental @xmath0-mode  is initially @xmath13 in the cold ocean ( @xmath107 ) . during active accretion , the predicted fundamental @xmath0-mode  frequency increases as unavoidable accretion - driven nuclear heating raises the ocean s temperature .",
    "for example , sources accreting between @xmath120 have predicted fundamental @xmath0-modes  between @xmath121 . predicted fundamental @xmath0-mode  frequencies @xmath17 require active shallow heating during outburst to reach ocean temperatures @xmath122 required to support these frequencies .",
    "therefore , observing nbos @xmath17 in transients that require shallow heating , such as maxi  j0556 - 332 , mxb  1659 - 29 , and xte  j1701 - 462 , provides an observational test to link nbos and the ocean @xmath0-modes .",
    "in particular , during steady - state accretion , maxi  j0556 - 332  has predicted fundamental @xmath0-mode  frequencies between @xmath6 , and mxb  1659 - 29  and xte  j1701 - 462  have predicted @xmath0-mode  frequencies between @xmath123 frequencies only possible in the hotter oceans found in sources with shallow heating .",
    "we predict that maxi  j0556 - 332 had a fundamental @xmath0-mode  frequency near @xmath124 at the time of its recent activity @xcite .",
    "if shallow heating is active during the current outburst in mxb  1659 - 29  @xcite , we predict that this source will have a fundamental @xmath0-mode  frequency near @xmath125 at the time of the most recent observation @xcite after being in outburst for @xmath15 .",
    "nbo frequencies observed in the last outburst from xte  j1701 - 462  @xcite are consistent with ocean @xmath0-modes .",
    "nbos were observed within the first @xmath126 near @xmath113 @xcite , and our model predicts fundamental @xmath0-mode  frequencies near @xmath113 after @xmath127 of active accretion .",
    "furthermore , once the ocean reaches steady state , our model of the xte  j1701 - 462  outburst contains predicted ocean @xmath0-modes  between @xmath128 , which is consistent with the observed @xmath129 nbos observed in this source during outburst @xcite .",
    "although current instrumentation may not allow observations of nbos in mxb  1659 - 29  and maxi  j0556 - 332  during quiescence , renewed accretion outbursts in both objects may allow observations of nbos .",
    "we predict that observed nbos during these sources current accretion outbursts should be @xmath130 in mxb  1659 - 29  and @xmath131 in maxi  j0556 - 332 . the renewed activity in maxi  j0556 - 332  @xcite perhaps holds the best prospects for catching large nbo frequencies because the ocean in maxi  j0556 - 332  had not cooled to the core temperature before the most recent accretion outburst , and the predicted ocean @xmath0-mode  frequency is already @xmath17 .",
    "note that the above observational tests for the presence of ocean @xmath0-modes  does not require a complete picture of how x - ray emission is modulated by ocean oscillations , which is outside the scope of this work .",
    "uncertainties remain in the nature of the accretion flow near the neutron star surface and how the accretion flow may interact with the neutron star s outer layers .",
    "for example , a spreading boundary layer of accreted material may extend into the ocean @xcite , and may transport angular momentum therein .",
    "a coupling of the boundary layer and the ocean in this way may only modulate x - ray emission near the equator , however , where modes may even interfere with accretion disk emission @xcite .",
    "if observations support a @xmath0-mode  origin for the nbos , this will motivate future work to model the ocean s coupling to a spreading boundary layer .",
    "if nbos are indeed ocean @xmath0-modes , observed nbo frequencies @xmath17 can then be used as a diagnostic of the shallow heating strength .",
    "for example , as shown in this work , ocean @xmath0-mode  frequencies near @xmath132 ( @xmath116 ) are found in sources in steady state with @xmath19 ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that during outburst the ocean in maxi  j0556 - 332  approaches a maximum temperature set by neutrino emission around @xmath134 at the depth of the shallow heat source @xcite .",
    "because the ocean temperature is near maximum , a @xmath0-mode  frequency of @xmath116 is likely the largest @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath0-mode  that can be supported in z - source oceans .",
    "therefore , nbo frequencies of @xmath116 only give the lower limit @xmath135 for the shallow heating strength .",
    "the depth of the ocean - crust transition during outburst is relevant to the study of the shallow heating mechanism .",
    "for example , the ocean - crust interface in maxi  j0556 - 332  moves to densities between @xmath136 during outburst .",
    "this density range is characteristic of the location of the shallow heating inferred from quiescent light curves of quasi - persistent transients @xcite , which is needed at mass densities near @xmath137 .",
    "for example , shallow heating is required between @xmath138 in maxi  j0556 - 332 , as determined from its quiescent light curve @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the shallow heating mechanism is connected to the ocean - crust phase transition , and work in this direction is ongoing .",
    "often the observed @xmath9 nbos blend into @xmath139 flaring branch oscillations ( hereafter fbos ) ; for example , a continuous blending was observed in sco  x-1 @xcite .",
    "the timescale of observed nbo - fbo blending disfavors a @xmath0-mode  origin for the fbos .",
    "the thermal time at the depth of the ocean - crust transition ( figure  [ fig : thermal_time ] ) determines the timescale for variations in the @xmath0-mode  frequencies . for @xmath0-mode  frequencies @xmath140",
    ", variations may occur on timescales of hours ; variations in frequencies @xmath141 occur on timescales of days much longer than the timescale of the observed blending . the nbo - fbo blending phenomena , however , is consistent with a superposition of ocean @xmath0-modes  and ocean interface waves .",
    "the interface modes were determined to have frequencies of @xmath142 when calculated with a rigid crust boundary condition @xcite , but may have lower frequencies near @xmath143 when the flexibility of the crust is taken into account @xcite .",
    "it is unclear why oscillation energy might transition between the different modes , but the coupling of the @xmath0-modes  to the interface modes is worthy of future study .",
    "quasi - periodic oscillations between @xmath94 in the atoll sources ( @xmath144 ) are also consistent with ocean @xmath0-modes .",
    "for example , the @xmath145 oscillation observed in 4u  1820 - 30 @xcite is consistent with a @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath0-mode  in a lighter ocean . in a lighter ocean , such as those considered in @xcite ,",
    "@xmath0-mode  frequencies are larger by a factor of @xmath146 compared to those studied in this work .",
