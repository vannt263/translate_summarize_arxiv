    "solutions to field equations in imaginary time have been of interest for many years and early work formalised the relevance of such systems to tunnelling problems @xcite @xcite .",
    "much of the current interest in instantons dates from the work of belavin , polyakov , shvarts , and tyupkin ( bpst ) @xcite , where an exact solution to the su(2 ) yang mills equations in imaginary time was found .",
    "the relevance of these solutions was then clarified by thooft @xcite and by jackiw and rebbi @xcite who showed that the bpst instanton solution is a mediator for the transition between different vacua of the gauge theory .",
    "the bpst instanton was found by looking for solutions with ( anti ) self - dual field strength .",
    "this led to the suggestion that analogous solutions may exist in gravity @xcite , where the duality governs the curvature two - form .",
    "the usefulness of such a duality is that it not only makes the curvature automatically solve einstein s vacuum equations @xcite , but also reduces the equations to first order .",
    "a geometry which possesses a symmetry also simplifies the problem .",
    "an important class of symmetries is the bianchi classification of spatially homogeneous 3-geometries@xcite .",
    "some solutions of this type with the property of self duality are known and can be found in reference @xcite ; we shall extend the collection of known solutions by finding metrics with the symmetry of bianchi types vi@xmath0 and vii@xmath0 that satisfy einstein s equations with a stiff fluid , that is where the pressure equals the energy density .",
    "this means that we can not use the simplification of self duality , however we do use it as a guide to find an initial ansatz .",
    "we shall also see that this ansatz allows a natural complex structure such that the metric is khler .",
    "the importance of gravitational instantons emerges in the path - integral formalism of quantum gravity . in this approach",
    "one considers a weighted sum over all euclidean metrics , where the weight is the exponential of the euclidean action .",
    "instantons , as solutions to the classical field equations , are expected to provide the dominant contribution to such a sum , and this allows a saddle - point approximation to be used in the neighbourhood of these solutions .",
    "the organisation of the paper is as follows .",
    "first we define the system of equations to be solved , and describe the self - dual vacuum solution .",
    "we solve the bianchi vii@xmath0 einstein equations in the presence of a stiff fluid .",
    "next , we follow misner @xcite by writing the action in the familiar form of a particle in a potential , in order to describe the qualitative nature of our solution .",
    "the bianchi vi@xmath0 solution follows from the bianchi vii@xmath0 results .",
    "the bianchi universes are four - manifolds with embedded three geometries which are spatially homogeneous but anisotropic ; they each possess a three - dimensional , simply - transitive , isometry group @xcite . to exploit this isometry we write the metric using the left - invariant one - forms of the symmetry group , @xmath1 ;",
    "as we are interested in instantons , we use a riemannian signature , @xmath2 the left - invariant one - forms satisfy the structure equations , @xmath3 for the case of bianchi vii@xmath0 , the structure constants take the values @xmath4 these metrics support killing vectors ( right - invariant vector fields ) with the same structure constants as the euclidean group in two dimensions .",
    "the self - dual solution will be of use to us in constructing an ansatz , so we shall calculate the torsion - free connection forms , @xmath5 @xcite , assuming they are metric connections , .thus , we rewrite the metric in terms of a new time variable and introduce an orthonormal basis , @xmath6 we find the following non - vanishing connection forms : @xmath7 where we have defined , , and @xmath8 refers to differentiation with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "we now assume the connection to be self dual , which in turn implies that the curvature is self dual @xcite , so plus permutations . @xmath10",
    "these equations show that @xmath11 is a constant , and give a metric , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an integration constant .",
    "we now derive a non - vacuum solution , ( which requires that self duality is lost ) .",
    "however , we use the self - dual solution to lead us to the ansatz of . in order to show that this solution does retain the khler property ,",
    "the metric is rewritten by introducing the complex forms @xmath14 defined by @xmath15 where the @xmath16 are those defined in ( [ orth ] ) .",
    "the metric now takes the form @xmath17 the khler form is then found to be @xmath18 the closure of the khler form , , then requires , so our ansatz leads to a khler manifold .",
    "we now want to consider the full bianchi vii@xmath0 equations , without requiring self duality .",
    "these can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite where we are now using a lorentzian signature , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the energy density , and @xmath21 denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "now we take the hint from the self - dual solution and assume , but we do not take @xmath23 to be zero",
    ". then equations ( [ aeqn],[beqn],[ceqn ] ) become , @xmath24 where we have used , and .",
    "equation ( [ heqn ] ) can be solved to give , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the modulus of the elliptic function , @xmath27 is the complementary modulus , and @xmath28 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "our notation conforms to that of @xcite . with ( [ ysoln ] )",
    "substituted into ( [ heqn ] ) we find @xmath29 we can integrate this equation once by noting that the elliptic integral @xmath30 satisfies,@xcite , @xmath31 allowing us to write ( [ heqnb ] ) as @xmath32 a change of variables to @xmath33 and the introduction of a new function @xmath34 defined by , @xmath35 means that we have @xmath36/\\theta [ 0]\\right ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the integration has been done using equation ( 630.02 ) of @xcite .",
    "this further simplifies when we realise .",
    "the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor , , gives the energy density @xmath23 as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a constant .",
    "the fourth einstein equation ( [ int ] ) reduces to @xmath39 but we already know @xmath40 is from ( [ ysoln ] ) , and the left - hand side comes from ( [ heqnb ] ) , so we have the two consistency relations @xmath41 in what follows , we shall use the value , with and . now that we have a relation between @xmath38 and @xmath26 we can rewrite ( [ ysoln ] ) using some elliptic function identities .",
    "we also make use of the fact that @xmath28 is an arbitrary integration constant which just shifts the origin of the solution .",
    "it proves convenient to choose , turning ( [ ysoln ] ) into ( see appendix [ appaa ] ) @xmath42 this is where we make a connection with the instanton solution .",
    "it is seen that if we take @xmath22 to be an imaginary parameter , , then the right - hand side of ( [ yeqnb ] ) becomes greater than or equal to one , meaning that @xmath43 is real .",
    "@xmath44 to proceed then , we are required to do an analytic continuation on ( [ h1eqn ] ) from @xmath22 to @xmath9 ( see appendix [ appab ] ) . @xmath45+c_1\\tau+c_2",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this completes the solution for the bianchi vii@xmath0 instanton with a stiff fluid .",
    "the solution is defined in the range , with @xmath46 going to zero at these limits . at these points",
    "then we see that the volume of the homogeneous 3-surfaces goes to zero , defining the end - points of the instanton .",
    "it can also be seen that the curvature of the instanton diverges at these points .",
    "let us now examine the system of equations ( [ aeqn]-[int ] ) in order to obtain an effective action . using imaginary time , @xmath9 , we see that these equations can be derived by extremising the action , @xmath47 again , we are using , , and @xmath8 for differentiation with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "the form of this action coincides with the einstein - hilbert action for the bianchi vii@xmath0 metric , found by calculating the curvature of the connection forms ( [ connections ] ) so that this effective action is proportional to the gravitational action , as expected , @xmath48 the boundary terms are designed to cancel the second derivatives coming from the ricci scalar term , @xcite , @xcite , in order that the equations of motion derive from the variational principle even on a boundary .",
    "the next step is to put the effective action ( [ seff ] ) into a familiar form , so we can visualise out solution .",
    "this is achieved by using the following misner variables @xcite , @xmath49 we then find that the effective action , in terms of the new functions , takes the familiar form for a particle moving in a potential well , ( [ newseff ] ) @xmath50 the @xmath51 functions evolve to create the time - dependent potential .",
    "[ pot ] illustrates the @xmath52-independent part of the potential , with a ridge along the @xmath53 axis .",
    "the behaviour of the two solutions outlined above , the self - dual and stiff fluid instantons , are given in fig .",
    "[ bp_bm ] .",
    "the figure shows the self - dual solution ( paths i@xmath54 and i@xmath55 ) evolves along the ridge and then falls off at some point determined by the arbitrary parameter @xmath13 of the solution , ( [ sd_metric ] ) .",
    "the solution for the stiff fluid contains three parameters , @xmath26 , @xmath56 and @xmath57.the general behaviour is shown in fig .",
    "[ bp_bm ] , which shows the solution evolving toward and then rolling over the ridge .",
    "the bianchi vi@xmath0 structure constants differ from bianchi vii@xmath0 ( [ b7struct ] ) by a single minus sign : @xmath58 this changes the symmetry group from the two dimensional euclidean group , e(2 ) , to e(1,1 ) , and also changes one of the equations of motion , ( [ ceqn ] ) . using the same metric as ( [ orth ] ) , but with the left - invariant one forms of e(1,1 ) , we find the new equation , @xmath59 again we make the ansatz giving @xmath60 where we have again taken , and . comparing equations ( [ ay ] ) and ( [ heqn6 ] ) , we see that the solution for @xmath34 in the bianchi vi@xmath0 case is the same as for the bianchi vii@xmath0 case , except that there is an addition of @xmath61 .",
    "however , the bianchi vi@xmath0 solution differs in other respects . by looking at the fourth einstein equation , ( [ ein4 ] )",
    ", we find a different relation between @xmath26 , @xmath27 and the parameter @xmath38 of ( [ energy ] ) . using ( [ 4einer ] ) and the new @xmath62 we may derive , @xmath63 using methods similar to the previous analysis one may then derive , @xmath64 this instanton is defined in the range . following the procedure outlined for the bianchi vii@xmath0 case , we may also derive the self - dual solution , @xmath65 the hamiltonian method used to describe the qualitative behaviour may also be adapted . on doing",
    "so we find that the solution is described by the effective action as ( [ newseff ] ) , only now the @xmath66 gets replaced by @xmath67 , using the same allocations as ( [ newparams ] ) .",
    "the effective potential for the @xmath68 is thus qualitatively the same as fig . [",
    "the paths that this solution describes in the @xmath51 plane are shown in fig .",
    "[ bp_bm6 ] , where the examples of self - dual solutions are labelled @xmath69 and @xmath70 , with @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 being stiff fluid examples .",
    "in this section we give an analytic solution of bianchi type vii@xmath0 in the presence of an electromagnetic two - form satisfying maxwell s relations . using the orthonormal basis for the metric we write maxwell s relations as , @xmath74 which are valid here because there are no charged sources .",
    "we consider here a two - form field strength of the form @xmath75 representing an electric and a magnetic field in the ` 3 ' direction .",
    "one quickly sees then that ( [ maxwell ] ) leads to both @xmath30 and @xmath76 being constant for the bianchi vii@xmath0 metric . when it comes to the field equations for the metric coefficients we have only a minor change .",
    "the right - hand side of ( [ aeqn]-[ceqn ] ) no longer vanishes but becomes @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is @xmath79 for ( [ aeqn ] ) , ( [ beqn ] ) and @xmath80 for ( [ ceqn ] ) . the constant @xmath81 that appears",
    "is given by ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there is a clear choice of ansatz for these equations , namely the biaxial ansatz with . taking this ansatz leads to @xmath82 and with the definition the equation for @xmath73 gives , @xmath83 taking note that we are now using euclidean time , .",
    "we can trivially perform the first integral of ( [ th1 ] ) by multiplying both sides by @xmath84 giving , @xmath85 integrating this and using ( [ c1 ] ) we find @xmath86 with @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 all constants of integration . the 4th einstein field equation ( eq.(15 ) in @xcite ) gives the constraint @xmath89 .",
    "the qualitative behaviour of this electromagnetic bianchi vii@xmath0 model follows from the previous discussion .",
    "the extra terms @xmath77 in the equations of motion correspond to the addition of an extra term @xmath90 in the effective action ( [ seff ] ) , which has the effect of tilting the potential in ( [ newseff ] ) in the @xmath53 direction .",
    "the trajectory in space is clear in this biaxial example , so the solution rolls along the axis .",
    "exact solutions of the einstein equations are only possible in the presence of symmetries or structural specialisations . when the metric signature is riemannian it is possible to find vacuum solutions when self duality is combined with three - dimensional homogeneity .",
    "we have used the structure of these solutions to find a number of non - vacuum solutions with stiff matter and electromagnetic field sources when self duality is necessarily relaxed .",
    "these solutions are of bianchi types vi and vii .",
    "we would like to acknowledge helpful discussions with gary gibbons and stephen siklos .",
