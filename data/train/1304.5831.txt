    "in @xcite , the minimality of semigroup actions ( equivalently , minimal set of iterated function systems , abbreviated as ifss ) on the interval are discussed and several examples of non - minimal actions are presented there . for these examples , we certainly know that the action is not minimal but we could not decide the  shape \" of the minimal set ( similar type of questions are extensively studied recently , see for example @xcite for complex dynamical systems case ) .    in the case of group actions on the circle , there is a famous trichotomy of the minimal set ( see for example chapter  2 of @xcite ) : either it is a finite set , equal to the whole manifold , or homeomorphic to the cantor set .",
    "thus once we know that the minimal set is niether the finite orbit nor the whole manifold , then we can immediately conclude that it is homeomorphic to the cantor set . on the other hand , in semigroup action case , because of the lack of homogeneity of the minimal set , this trichotomy is no longer valid .",
    "the best thing we know in general is , as is stated in @xcite ( see theorem  5.2 ) , the trichotomy of the following type : the minimal set is either a finite set , homeomorphic to the cantor set or a closed set with non - empty interior .",
    "this trichotomy is not enough to conclude the type of minimal set just from the non - minimality of the action .    in this article",
    ", we give an example of class of ifss with a minimal set homeomorphic to the cantor set .",
    "they are produced by performing some modifications on the example presented in @xcite .",
    "thus , still i do not know the type of minimal set for the original examples , see also remark  [ r.open ] .",
    "after the announcement of this example , masayuki asaoka ( kyoto university ) showed me another example of minimal cantor set using the measure theoretic argument . in the appendix we present that example .    *",

    "in this section , we prepare some definitions , give the axiomatic description of the example and the precise statement of our main result .",
    "we consider ifss on the closed unit interval @xmath0 $ ] generated by two maps @xmath1 satisfying the following conditions :    * @xmath2 are @xmath3-diffeomorphisms on their images . *",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 . * @xmath6 for @xmath7 . * @xmath8 .",
    "we denote the set of the pairs of diffeomorphisms satisfying these conditions by @xmath9 ( by @xmath10 we denote the set of @xmath3-maps from @xmath11 to itself which is diffeomorphism on its image ) .",
    "we prepare some notations and basic definitions .",
    "we denote the semigroup generated by @xmath12 and @xmath13 by @xmath14 .",
    "it acts on @xmath11 in a natural way . for @xmath15 , the orbit of @xmath16 , denoted by @xmath17 ,",
    "is defined to be the set @xmath18 .",

    "finally , we say that the action of @xmath14 is minimal if @xmath11 is the minimal set , in other words , every point in @xmath11 has a dense orbit .    for ifss generated by @xmath24 , we can prove the following ( see lemma  1 in @xcite ) :    there exists a unique minimal set @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , we have @xmath26 .    for @xmath27 , put @xmath28 $ ] and call it _ overlapping region _",
    "( @xmath29 is the overlap between @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) .",

    "more precisely , we have @xmath50 .",
    "suppose @xmath51 .",
    "we consider the case @xmath52 ( the proof of the case @xmath53 is similar so we omit it ) .",
    "then we know that there exists a point @xmath54 .",
    "since @xmath55 , it means that there exists a point @xmath56 such that @xmath57 or @xmath58 holds .",
    "however , since @xmath59 by definition , the second option can not happen .",
    "hence we have @xmath60 and it implies @xmath61 . by repeating this process , we continue taking the backward image of @xmath16 contained in @xmath62 . at some moment",
    "it must be equal to @xmath63 but this is a contradiction .",
    "we define two maps @xmath64 and @xmath65 as follows : for @xmath66 , let @xmath67 be the least non - negative integer such that @xmath68 holds .",
    "this defines a piecewise @xmath3 map @xmath64 by setting @xmath69 ( @xmath70 is just an  induced map \" from @xmath71 to @xmath72 of the inverse system @xmath73 ) .",
    "we define @xmath74 similarly , exchanging the role of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "then let us consider the following property :    @xmath70 is uniformly expanding outside @xmath75 and @xmath74 is as such outside @xmath76 .",
    "more precisely , there exists @xmath77 such that at each @xmath78 ( resp .",
    "@xmath79 ) , @xmath80 ( resp .",
    "@xmath81 ) where @xmath82 ranges over the points for which the term @xmath83 ( resp .",
    "@xmath84 ) makes sense .",
    "we call this property _ eventual expansion property _ and denote it by @xmath85 .",
    "in general , the property @xmath85 may be violated by some small perturbation . however ,",
    "if @xmath86 then we see that @xmath85 is a @xmath3-open property .      finally , we define the castration property .",
    "we put @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "we call them ruination region . note that by construction @xmath89 is the disjoint union of infinitely many intervals accumulating to @xmath90 and @xmath91 to @xmath92 .",
    "then , the castration property is stated as follows :    @xmath93 .",
    "we denote this property by @xmath94 .    by the structure of @xmath89 and @xmath91",
    ", we observe the following :    [ r.hairu ] if @xmath94 holds , then @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "a priori , the openness of the property @xmath94 is not clear , since it involves the conditions of infinitely many intervals .",
    "however , by remark  [ r.hairu ] , together with the structure of @xmath89 and @xmath91 , we see that it only involves the conditions of finitely many intervals . as a corollary",
    ", we see that @xmath94 is a @xmath43-open property in @xmath32 .",
    "we denote the set of pairs of diffeomorphisms in @xmath32 satisfying the conditions @xmath40 , @xmath49 , @xmath85 and @xmath94 by @xmath97 .",
    "now , we state our main result .",
    "if @xmath98 is in @xmath97 then the ( unique ) minimal set of @xmath14 is homeomorphic to the cantor set .",
    "later we also prove the following :    [ p.sonzai ] in @xmath9 , the set @xmath97 has non - empty interior ( with respect to the relative topology on @xmath32 induced by the @xmath3-topology on @xmath99 ) .    as a corollary",
    ", we see that our example can be taken @xmath100 or @xmath101 .",
    "[ r.open ] for @xmath27 satisfying the condition @xmath40 and @xmath49 , we know that the action of @xmath14 is not minimal .",
    "however , in general the author does not know if the minimal set is homeomorphic to the cantor set or not .",
    "in this section , we give the proof of our theorem .",
    "we fix @xmath102 and consider its unique minimal set @xmath25 .",
    "we first remember the famous characterization of the cantor set : if a topological space is a compact , metrizable , perfect and totally disconnected , then it is homeomorphic to the cantor set ( see for example @xcite ) . in our setting , it is clear that @xmath25 satisfies the first and the second properties .",
    "the perfectness of the minimal set can be seen easily by definition of the minimal set .",
    "thus we only need to prove the totally disconnectedness of @xmath25 . for that , since we work on one dimensional setting , we only need to prove the emptiness of the interior .",
    "we state it in more precise way .",
    "[ r.reduce ] for the proof of the theorem , we only need to prove the following : for every @xmath20 and every non - empty open interval @xmath103 containing @xmath16 , there exists a non - empty interval @xmath104 such that @xmath105 .",
    "first , we start from some simple observations .",
    "[ l.aruyo ] let @xmath103 be a non - empty open interval .    * if @xmath106 ( resp .",

    "then , if @xmath112 ( resp .",
    "@xmath113 ) , we have @xmath110 ( resp .",
    "@xmath114 ) .",
    "we start from the proof of the first item . by the symmetry",
    ", we only consider the case @xmath106 ( and omit the case @xmath107 ) .",
    "one important observation for the proof is the following : if @xmath115 belongs to @xmath116 , then @xmath117 . indeed , in general , for given @xmath118 we have either @xmath119 or @xmath120 ( both condition may hold simultaneously ) . since @xmath115",
    ", the second option can not hold .",
    "so we see that @xmath119 .",
    "then , fix @xmath121 so that @xmath122 holds . by repeating the similar reasoning",

    "in particular , we have @xmath126 , which is equal to @xmath127 by definition .",
    "thus we see that @xmath128 contains a point @xmath129 , which implies @xmath109 .",
    "let us consider the proof of the second item .",
    "again by the symmetry between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , we only treat the case where @xmath112 and omit the case @xmath113 .",
    "suppose @xmath112 and there exists a point @xmath130 . then , as is the previous discussion , one of the following options holds : @xmath131 or @xmath132 .",
    "however , the condition @xmath133 implies @xmath134 and this , together with proposition  [ p.tenganai ] prohibits the first option .",
    "thus we have @xmath135 , which implies what we claimed .    in the similar way",
    ", we have the following ( we omit the proof of it ) .    [ l.naiyo ] if @xmath136 , then @xmath137 .",
    "we prepare one definition . for @xmath102",
    ", we define @xmath138 where @xmath139 denotes the boundary of @xmath23 .",
    "then we have the following .    [ l.sukima ] if @xmath103 is an open interval with @xmath140 ( resp .",
    "@xmath141 ) , then there exists a non - empty open interval @xmath142 with @xmath143 .",
    "in other words , @xmath144 ( resp .",
    "@xmath145 ) .    take @xmath103 with @xmath140 .",
    "we divide our situation into four cases : @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 or @xmath149 .    for the first case , remember proposition  [ p.tenganai ] : it implies that every non - empty open set @xmath150 is disjoint from @xmath25 .",
    "thus one of such @xmath151 gives us the desired set .    in the second case , using the castration property ( that is , @xmath152 ) , we see that there exists a non - empty open set @xmath153 . by lemma  [ l.naiyo ] , this @xmath151 gives the desired set .",
    "the third case is reduced to the second case by remark  [ r.hairu ] and the fact that @xmath89 accumulates to @xmath90 .    in the last case ,",
    "consider @xmath154 .",
    "then it contains @xmath90 .",
    "thus by the previous argument , we can take @xmath155 with @xmath156 .",
    "then , by repeating the similar argument as lemma  [ l.aruyo ] , we see that @xmath157 gives us the desired interval .",
    "now we start the proof of the theorem .",
    "remember that to prove the theorem we only need to prove the statement in remark  [ r.reduce ] .",

    "then we have five possibilities : @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 or @xmath178 .",

    "note that , by eventual expansion property , this process finishes in finite steps .",

    "however , applying lemma  [ l.aruyo ] or [ l.naiyo ] to each option of the construction of @xmath201 , we see that @xmath202 contains a point of @xmath116 . then by induction",

    "we give the proof for the case where @xmath158 is outside @xmath39 , which completes the proof of the theorem .    in this case , we know that @xmath158 is contained in @xmath205 or @xmath206 . by the symmetry , we only need to consider the first case .    by shrinking @xmath158 if necessary , we can assume that there exists @xmath207 such that @xmath208 .",
