    "one can also monitor the spontaneous emission of the atoms into transverse modes not confined by the cavity .",
    "it is not generally possible to directly determine the state of the atoms after they have passed through the cavity because the spontaneous emission lifetime is on the scale of nanoseconds .",

    "this scheme has other interesting features that are worth mentioning here .",
    "first , since nearly all the energy used in this dispersive measurement scheme is dissipated in the remote terminations of the input and output transmission lines , it has the practical advantage of avoiding quasiparticle generation in the qubit .",
    "another key feature of the cavity qed readout is that it lends itself naturally to operation of the box at the charge degeneracy point ( @xmath23 ) , where it has been shown that @xmath24 can be enormously enhanced @xcite because the energy splitting has an extremum with respect to gate voltage and isolation of the qubit from 1/f dephasing is optimal .",
    "the derivative of the energy splitting with respect to gate voltage is the charge difference in the two qubit states . at the degeneracy point",
    "this derivative vanishes and the environment can not distinguish the two states and thus can not dephase the qubit .",
    "this also implies that a charge measurement can not be used to determine the state of the system @xcite . while the first derivative of the energy splitting with respect to gate voltage vanishes at the degeneracy point , the second derivative , corresponding to the difference in charge _",
    "polarizability _ of the two quantum states , is _ maximal_. one can think of the qubit as a non - linear quantum system having a state - dependent capacitance ( or in general , an admittance ) which changes sign between the ground and excited states @xcite .",
    "it is this change in polarizability which is measured in the dispersive qnd measurement .",
    "in contrast , standard charge measurement schemes @xcite require moving away from the optimal point",

    "@xcite have recently raised the possibility that there are numerous parasitic environmental resonances which can relax the qubit when its frequency @xmath2 is changed during the course of moving the operating point .",
    "the dispersive cqed measurement is therefore highly advantageous since it operates best at the charge degeneracy point . in general , such a measurement of an ac property of the qubit is strongly desirable in the usual case where dephasing is dominated by low frequency ( 1/f ) noise .",
    "notice also that the proposed quantum non - demolition measurement would be the inverse of the atomic microwave cqed measurement in which the state of the photon field is inferred non - destructively from the phase shift in the state of atoms sent through the cavity @xcite .",

    "[ fig : bit - flip ] confirms this simple picture and that single - bit rotations can be performed with very high fidelity .",
    "it is interesting to note that since detuning between the resonator and the drive is large , the cavity is only virtually populated , with an average photon number @xmath39 .",
    "virtual population and depopulation of the cavity can be realized much faster than the cavity lifetime @xmath40 and , as a result , the qubit feels the effect of the drive rapidly after the drive has been turned on .",
    "the limit on the speed of turn on and off of the drive is set by the detuning @xmath41 .",
    "if the drive is turned on faster than @xmath42 , the frequency spread of the drive is such that part of the drive s photons will pick up phase information ( see fig .",
