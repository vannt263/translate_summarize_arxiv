    "we often find an interesting relationship between a geometry and a supersymmetric quantum field theory by compactifying a higher dimensional conformal field theory . the class _ s _ theories @xcite are famous examples which are obtained by compactification of 6-dimensional ( 2,0 ) superconformal field theories ( scfts ) by riemann surfaces .",
    "alday - gaiotto - tachikawa correspondence @xcite is a relation between a class _ s _ theory and a 2-dimensional cft on the riemann surface .",
    "scfts obtained from a @xmath3-dimensional theory compactified on various manifolds are studied , for example , @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to consider a riemann surface with boundary .",
    "however for the class _ s _ theories it seems difficult to introduce a boundary of the riemann surface since an m5-brane can not have a supersymmetric boundary .    in this paper",
    "we construct 2-dimensional cfts obtained from compactification of 4-dimensional gauge theories on riemann surfaces with boundary .",
    "to realize a boundary theory we consider type iib superstring in this paper .",
    "our gauge theory is a 4-dimensional @xmath0 super yang - mills theory ( sym ) realized on the world - volume of d3-branes .",
    "these d3-branes can end on d5-branes or ns5-branes , and thus can have a boundary .",
    "the 2-dimensional cfts obtained from compactification on closed riemann surfaces @xcite are studied by using @xmath4-extremization @xcite .",
    "this method is an analogue to @xmath5-maximization in 4-dimensions @xcite and @xmath6-maximization in 3-dimensions @xcite . for @xmath5-maximization its gravity dual",
    "is studied in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the 4-dimensional @xmath0 sym on @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a riemann surface with a boundary . in the low energy limit",
    "this theory is expected to become a 2-dimensional cft .",
    "we find a class of boundary conditions at the boundary of @xmath8 which preserve some of the supersymmetry , following the strategy of @xcite .",
    "the boundary is a geodesic and preserves the @xmath9 supersymmetry out of the @xmath10 original bulk supersymmetry , respectively .",
    "it is an interesting future work to study more general boundary conditions as in @xcite and s - duality . in this paper",
    "we also show some attempt to find a different class of boundary conditions . among these theories",
    "we calculate the central charge for the @xmath1 case because in this case the central charge is related to the t hooft anomaly coefficients which are invariant under the renormalization group flow @xcite .",
    "we obtain a positive central charge only when the euler number @xmath11 of @xmath8 is negative . in this case",
    "the central charge is written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dimension of the gauge group .",
    "this theory has the @xmath14 superconformal symmetry with @xmath15(integer ) .",
    "therefore this theory seems to be a sigma model with a calabi - yau target space .",
    "further study of this theory , in particular the relationship with the theory of @xcite , is also an interesting problem .",
    "this result coincides with the case for the central charge of theories compactified on the closed riemann surfaces @xcite .",
    "studying the reason of the coincidence between out result and previous works @xcite is an interesting future work .",
    "another interesting future work is to investigate the realization in the string theory and ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "our setup is realized by d3-branes wrapping on a holomorphic cycle in a local calabi - yau manifold and ending on a 5-brane system @xcite .",
    "the construction of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we introduce a twisted compactification of 4-dimensional gauge theories following @xcite . in section 3",
    "we find a condition for preserving supersymmetry and calculate the central charge .",

    "[ subsec : reduction ] , first we obtain the action on the flat spacetime . in subsections [ subsec : riemannsurf ] and",
    "[ subsec : twist ] we introduce a closed riemann surface with constant curvature and twist the theory .",
    "we also show how many supersymmetries are preserved by compactification on closed riemann surfaces .",
    "the 4-dimensional @xmath16 sym action on the flat spacetime is obtained by the trivial dimensional reduction from the 10-dimensional sym .",
