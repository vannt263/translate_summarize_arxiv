    "one of the hallmark distinctions between qso absorption systems containing strong c  iv lines and those which do not has been , since early in the history of their study , the difference in clustering between the two populations as seen along single lines of sight . the ly  @xmath4 forest has always been shown to be weakly clustered compared to c  iv absorbers ( webb 1987 , hu et al .  1995 , chernomordik 1995 , cristiani et al .",
    "1995 ) , and perhaps not detectably clustered at all ( sargent et al .  1980 , rauch et al .  1992 , lu et al .",
    "1996 , kirkman & tytler 1997 ) .",
    "in contrast , even early studies showed that c  iv absorbers cluster significant in velocity along single sightlines ( young et al .",
    "1982 ) , with perhaps the best evidence coming from a large compilation of qso spectra at approximately 100  km  s@xmath2 resolution ( sargent et al .",
    "1988 , hereafter ssb ) .",
    "this is usually described by the two - point correlation function @xmath5 which equals the excess number of absorbers over random expectation found at a certain location with respect to a given absorber , usually quantified as a spatial or velocity separation between the two locations ( and with @xmath5 normalized by dividing by the random expectation ) .",
    "depending on the sample selected , for line - of - sight velocity differences @xmath6 of 200 - 600  km  s@xmath2 , values of @xmath5 for c  iv absorbers were found with @xmath7 or larger .",
    "similar behavior is found in large c iv samples at spectral resolution higher than that of ssb e.g.  within the largest clustering sample , 10 sightlines at 18 to 40 km s@xmath2 fwhm resolution , analyzed by petitjean and bergeron ( 1994 - pb ) .",
    "( other recent works at even higher resolution are based on even fewer sightlines : songaila & cowie 1996 , fernndez - soto et al .",
    "1996 , rauch et al .  1996 . )",
    "pb , like ssb , find an average @xmath7 for @xmath8 - 600  km  s@xmath2 , dominated by a broad , slowly declining component .",
    "( specifically , they fit @xmath5 with two components , of widths @xmath9 and 525  km  s@xmath2 , with the broader component containing 71% of the pair count over 30 - 1000  km  s@xmath2 and 93% over 200 - 600  km  s@xmath2 . )   in contrast , even in those papers which found some clustering in the ly  @xmath4 forest , also on approximately these @xmath6 scales or slightly smaller , the signal rarely exceeded @xmath10 .",
    "this is seen as clear evidence for a difference between these population , possibly implying distinct origins for the two .",
    "there are caveats to this interpretation which suggest caution in comparing the single - sightline @xmath5 values of the ly  @xmath4 forest and c  iv absorber populations .",
    "first , it is possible that single - sightline velocity splittings might arise from internal motions within absorbers , in which case the differences between the two populations single - sightline @xmath5 functions are not clearly tied to their spatial clustering behavior .",
    "ssb argue that , for c  iv absorption arising in galaxy haloes , these velocity splittings can not be due to gravitational orbits within these haloes , and clustering still contributes the dominant portion of the observed @xmath5 on scales larger than @xmath11  km  s@xmath2 . indeed , many papers have modeled qso absorption - line clustering in terms of spatial separations indicated by their relative velocities , whereas for highly over - dense structures , large differences between velocity clustering and spatial clustering become apparent e.g.  kaiser ( 1997 ) .",
    "models have been proposed , however , where non - gravitational acceleration might lead to splittings with large @xmath6 ( york et al .",
    "1986 ) .",
    "second , the intrinsic width of ly  @xmath4 lines , up to @xmath12  km  s@xmath2 , is much higher than for c  iv because of thermal broadening , and significant on the scale of the clustering in @xmath6 being discussed .",
    "line - of - sight blending of ly  @xmath4 lines does seem to obscure some of the clustering power seen in their corresponding c  iv lines fernndez - soto et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "one way to assess the importance of such effects is to study the clustering of absorbers in adjacent sightlines close enough together so that the angular separation between them is less than or comparable to the velocity scales where clustering is seen or sought in single sightlines , here assuming that a hubble expansion law at high redshift can be used to relate @xmath6 and transverse separation .",
    "this addresses all of the above concerns .",
    "first , purely internal velocity splittings can not shift absorbers to a different sightline , and , second , blending can not eliminate all of the small @xmath6 absorber pairs that would otherwise exist between sightlines .",
    "even if blending decreases or splittings increase the number of close absorbers pairs between sightlines , there is much less effect on @xmath5 because these effects also change the total numbers of pairs used to normalize @xmath5 . if all absorbers in a population are equally likely to cluster i.e.  if all within a population cluster in a way described purely by the same @xmath5 , the effects of blending or line splitting on close pairs and distant pairs cancel .",
    "the 1623 + 27 qso triplet discovered by sramek and weedman ( 1978 ) and has been used to measure the spatial two - point correlation function ( here also denoted by @xmath5 ) of ly @xmath4 absorbers ( crotts 1989 , crotts & fang 1996 , with some members of the triplet also observed by sargent et al .",
    "1982 , and ssb ) .",
    "we have obtained keck hires spectra of these three qsos , yielding a sample of c  iv absorbers large enough and unambiguous enough that a useful comparison of spatial c  iv clustering can be made to ly @xmath4 clustering and single - sightline c  iv clustering .",
    "these c  iv clustering results are rather different from prior results from single sightlines alone , which changes our understanding of clustering at high redshift .",
    "on the night of 20 may 1996 , we used the hires spectrograph ( vogt 1994 ) on the keck-1 10 m telescope to obtain spectra of the qso triplet q1623 + 27 .",
    "each of the qsos was observed with the same setup , providing wavelength coverage from 3872 to 6299 .",
    "the observations were performed sequentially over a four hour period , and the spectrograph was not moved between observations .",
    "we exposed for 5400s on both q1623.7",
    "+ 268a ( kp 76 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) and q1623.9 + 268 ( kp 78 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , and 3000s on q1623.7 + 268b ( kp 77 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) .",
    "the exposures were taken with a 1.14@xmath19 slit , which gave a resolution of 8  km  s@xmath2 and adequate sky coverage .",
    "the images were processed and the spectra were optimally extracted using an automated routine specifically designed by t.  a.  barlow for hires spectra . the routine performs baseline subtraction , bias and flat - field corrections , and utilizes a bright standard star to trace the echelle orders and define the apertures for extraction .",
    "thorium - argon lamp images were obtained immediately after the observations to provide wavelength calibrations in each echelle order .",
    "the root - mean - square residuals in the wavelength calibration for each echelle order was less than 0.3  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "all wavelengths are vacuum values in the heliocentric frame .",
    "each echelle order was continuum fit with a legendre polynomial to normalize the unabsorbed qso flux level to unity .",
    "as an example of these data , we present figure 1 , which shows a particularly complex c  iv doublet from the faintest qso , kp 78 , fit by 10 components . the positions of components and best fit flux from vpfit ( carswell et al .",
    "1992 ) were determined ; seen in figure 1 for the @xmath20 system , along with the continuum fit .",
    "the spectrum does not have useful snr in the blue , where the correcponding lya lines lie .",
    "the redshifts of c  iv doublets found in these data are listed in table 1 .",
    "we include only those redward of the ly @xmath4 forest , and list them according to the 200  km  s@xmath2 `` blended '' sample treated below . in comparison ,",
    "the crotts and fang ( 1997 ) @xmath21  kpno 4 m sample contains within this redshift interval the two stronger c  iv doublets in kp 76 , all of the kp 77 sample ( with 1.878027 and 1.880660 blended together ) , and all of the kp 78 sample except 2.115063 , with 2.061465 listed as uncertain .",
    "their uncertain system at @xmath22 kp 77 appears to be a misinterpretation of the confused region of c iv and mg ii doublets near 5280 .",
    "sightline cross - correlating pairs for all c  iv systems results in 36 in the first bin ( @xmath23  km  s@xmath2 ) , compared to the random expectation from a linear fit over the first 20000  km  s@xmath2 of @xmath24 for the first 500  km  s@xmath2 bin .",
    "these counts are obviously highly non - poisson , so we do not assign an error estimate to the resulting two point function of @xmath25  km s@xmath26 .",
    "it is more reasonable to consider merging c  iv redshifts close to each other in the same sightline , since it seems likely that these are multiple representatives of the same absorber .",
    "if we over - correct for this effect , we do not damage the cross - sightline @xmath5 , since blending together systems does not reduce the fraction of pairs between sightlines due to close cross - sightline @xmath6 values , compared to the total number of cross pairs . we choose to blend together all systems in the same sightline within 200  km  s@xmath2 of each other , starting with the smallest splitting first",
    "this is the same criterion adopted by ssb , so it leads to a direct comparison .",
    "the cross correlation of this sample ( and samples defined by further criteria ) are shown in figure 2 .    in correspondence with ssb ,",
    "we reduce the sample to only those systems which would likely have been detected by their survey .",
    "this is a heterogeneous selection in terms of rest equivalent width @xmath27 , and corresponds roughly to @xmath28  for their `` sample a2 '' ( which also excludes all absorbers within 5000  km  s@xmath2 of the emission - line redshift .",
    "a homogeneous sample in @xmath27 requires a cut at 0.15  ( their sample `` a4 , '' also with @xmath295000  km  s@xmath2 ) .    the randomly expected number of pairs in the first 500  km  s@xmath2 bin for each of these subsamples ( `` blended , '' `` a2 , '' and `` a4 '' ) are @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , respectively , whereas the actually observed number of pairs in the first bin for each sample is 4 , 1 and 0 , respectively , leading to @xmath5 values of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "( these are 68% confidence intervals , corresponding to @xmath36 , assuming poisson errors in pair counts , which is close to correct . )",
    "at @xmath37 ( and for @xmath38 ) the transverse separations between the three qsos correspond to velocities in the hubble flow of 286 to 399  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "( for @xmath39 they are 0.95 times smaller . )",
    "therefore , structure dominated by the hubble flow over 200 to 600  km  s@xmath2 would contribute to clustering on these scales , and correspond to proper separations of 0.36 to 1.07  @xmath40  mpc . since separations between the sightlines are smaller than this ( 0.51 to 0.71  @xmath40  mpc ) , one must add a perpendicular ( line of sight ) velocity component up to about 500  km  s@xmath2 ( although more typically about 200  km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "correlational activity from such a signal should be restricted to the first 500  km  s@xmath2 bin in figure 2 .",
    "nevertheless , the single sightlines over 200 - 600  km  s@xmath2 and the multiple sightlines for @xmath41  km  s@xmath2 probe slightly different volumes around each absorber",
    ". we can evaluate the importance of the different sampling regions by considering the analytic fit by pb to the number of pairs in these velocity intervals .",
    "they find that the number of pairs is well - approximated by the sum of two gaussians , with standard - deviation velocity widths of 109 and 525 km s@xmath2 , and with the wider gaussian contributing 30% of the number of pairs to the sum of the gaussians at their peak at zero velocity .",
    "when we integrate this distribution over the ssb sampling volume covering 200 - 600 km s@xmath2 , we find 1.15 times as many pairs as when we integrate over the triple - sightline sampling volume .",
    "this is a relatively minor effect which we neglect hereafter , but one which tends to lower slightly the discrepancy we discuss below .",
    "the actual value seen by ssb for the a2 sample is @xmath42  km  s@xmath43 , which should be compared to our @xmath44 , and for a4 @xmath42  km  s@xmath45 , which is even more directly comparable to our @xmath46 . the a2 result is inconsistent at about the @xmath47 level , while the a4 result is discrepant by about @xmath48 , both in the sense that the absorbers are less clustered in adjacent sightlines than is predicted by the single - sightlines result assuming pure hubble flow .",
    "we confirmed that the line - of - sight clustering in our three spectra are consistent with those in the ssb sample of 55 qsos .",
    "we constructed the c  iv redshift auto - correlation function for @xmath49 along each of the three sightlines taken individually , then summed together .",
    "for all systems , one finds @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , for all c  iv systems , blended systems , `` a2 '' and a4 samples , respectively , in the first 600  km  s@xmath2 bin .",
    "these are constructed using the average number of pairs in 600  km  s@xmath2 bins with 600  km  s@xmath52 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "these measurements are consistent with their corresponding ssb values , albeit at much poorer @xmath53 due to the smaller number of qso sightlines .    the inconsistency of the two - point correlation function derived from figure 2 with that of ssb implies that single sightline correlation functions can not be used to study the _ spatial _ clustering of absorbers on velocity scales of several hundred km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this may be due either to internal velocities within absorbers that are caused by non - gravitational processes , or by motion within gravitational potentials that have separated from the hubble flow .",
    "these structures , either individual absorbers or clusters of absorbers , must be small enough to add little clustering power on scales of 0.5 to 1.1 @xmath40 mpc . in either case ,",
    "most of the line - of - sight correlational power is due to behavior not described by the absorber positions alone , but some peculiar motion .",
    "line - of - sight absorber correlation functions should not be compared directly to galaxy correlation functions usually expressed as @xmath54 in terms of a radial separation vector @xmath55 in space .",
    "this spatial clustering of c  iv absorbers is much weaker than would be expected for galaxies at @xmath56 .",
    "a direct comparison involves averaging the galaxy correlation function @xmath57 , where we assume @xmath58 and @xmath59  mpc ( derived from park et al .",
    "1994 , although there are lower @xmath60 values for different samples e.g.  fisher et al .",
    "this is averaged over a line segment extending from the tangent point at closest approach ( 0.512 , 0.593 , and 0.714 @xmath40 mpc for each of the sightline pairs ) and extending to the point at @xmath61  km  s@xmath2 ( 1.031 , 1.073 , and 1.144",
    "@xmath40 mpc , respectively ) . averaged over all three sightlines , @xmath62 .",
    "assumably , this can be back - evolved to @xmath37 with stable hierarchical clustering formalism ( davis & peebles 1977 ) if @xmath63 , according to @xmath64 .",
    "( formally , this assumes @xmath38 , but remaining non - linear over all relevant @xmath65 , is a close approximation for other cosmilogical densities . )   note that high-@xmath65 clustering ( hudon & lilly 1996 ) measured at @xmath66 corresponds to @xmath67 , and extrapolates to @xmath68 at @xmath37 assuming stable clustering .",
    "these result is consistent with any of the comparable values obtained above for c  iv absorbers .    even though there are large differences between the line - of - sight clustering of the ly @xmath4 forest and c  iv systems , their clustering power between different lines of sight is more similar .",
    "the strength of c  iv clustering is consistent with that of the ly @xmath4 forest at similar redshifts .",
    "crotts & fang ( 1996 ) show , for these same sightlines at nearly the same redshift @xmath69 , that @xmath70 for ly @xmath71 lines with @xmath72  and @xmath73  km  s@xmath2 . for @xmath23",
    "km  s@xmath2 , there are 51 pairs observed versus 19 expected , implying @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "measured in this way , it is unclear that c  iv clustering is stronger than ly @xmath4 clustering .",
    "however , ly @xmath4 spatial clustering is less than the expectation for galaxies assuming stable hierarchical clustering ( @xmath76 ) , but not necessarily weaker than when we start from the hudon & lilly result .",
    "one remaining question is whether the structure we probe on 0.5 mpc scales might actually probe the scale of individual absorbers .",
    "we are fairly confident that this analysis of @xmath5 addresses more the clustering of absorbers than some measure of their characteristic size .",
    "the size of c  iv absorbers is indicated by the transverse separation at which absorbers in one sightline have high probability of appearing in the adjacent sightline . for gravitationally - lensed qsos ( steidel & sargent 1991 ) and for distinct qso pairs ( crotts et al .",
    "1994 ) , strong correspondence between adjacent absorption lines indicates c  iv absorber sizes of only a few tens of kiloparsecs . on scales smaller than this , absorbers are presumed to merge . on scales larger than this , up to the 0.5  @xmath40  mpc sampled by the qso triplet , it is still possible that motion within objects that have collapsed out of the hubble flow might still be responsible for much of the clustering signal for 200  km  s@xmath77  km  s@xmath2 reported by ssb .",
    "calculating @xmath78 for the galaxy two - point correlation function at @xmath37 , assuming stable hierarchical clustering development , one finds @xmath79 for separations ( along a sightline ) of 40  @xmath40  kpc to 0.5  @xmath40  mpc , still larger than @xmath5 found for the a2 or a4 samples of ssb .",
    "the ssb 200 - 600  km  s@xmath2 clustering signal might plausibly be explained as clusters of absorbers smaller than 0.5  @xmath40  mpc with internal velocities of a few hundred km  s@xmath2 .",
    "indeed , high resolution simulations of fragments collapsing ultimately into galaxies at @xmath80 show that these fragments at @xmath81 subtend such spatial scales e.g.  rauch , haehnelt & steinmetz ( 1997 ) .",
    "these conclusions are based on a single group of sightlines , and such close groupings of reasonably bright , sufficiently high @xmath65 qsos are extremely rare .",
    "nonetheless , a larger sample to check and refine these conclusions is desired .",
