    "frustrated magnetism arises when spins between nearby magnetic sites can not form a unique alignment to minimize their magnetic interactions , and leads to the possibility of a macroscopically degenerate classical ground state .",
    "materials with antiferromagnetic nearest neighbor interactions between local moments lying at the sites of corner - sharing tetrahedra or triangles comprise a considerable fraction of the gf magnetic systems known to date .",
    "most magnetic materials select a particular ordering wavevector , representative of their magnetic structure , upon the onset of magnetic order . in contrast , in frustrated magnets , it is not uncommon to find within the mean field approximation a set of degenerate continuously connected  ordering wavevectors \" which span the three - dimensional ( 3-d ) space .",
    "for example , the disordered ground state of the classical heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice @xcite features such a wavevector manifold .",
    "partially ordered magnets lie between these two extremes , forming degenerate wavevector ( 2-d ) surfaces or ( 1-d ) lines in a 3-d space .",
    "the name of `` partially ordered '' comes from the fact that there is a long - range order along the direction normal to this degenerate manifold .",
    "in other words , in such systems , to very low temperatures , a system may appear disordered / ordered to measurements probing parallel / perpendicular directions to this line or surface .",
    "a growing number of frustrated spin models have been shown to exhibit such a partial order.@xcite experimental evidence for partial order has been observed in single - crystal neutron scattering measurements of the correlated metals , mnsi@xcite under pressure , and cecu@xmath2au@xmath3@xcite , although in these materials it is unlikely to arise from considerations as simple as here considered .",
    "our interest in this problem arose from the realization that partial order has been found using large-@xmath0 theory on both the trillium and distorted windmill lattices .",
    "the key question we address in this paper is whether these partially ordered states can be captured beyond the large-@xmath0 theory.@xcite if not , to what extent can the results of large-@xmath0 theory be regained due to thermal fluctuations ? we answer this question by carrying out large scale classical monte carlo simulations of the af heisenberg model on the trillium and distorted windmill lattices .",
    "large-@xmath0 theory and mc simulations of the classical heisenberg model give consistent results for both highly frustrated systems ( ex : on the pyrochlore lattice a disordered ground state is found ) , and for unfrustrated lattices , ( ex : choosing the correct ordering wavevector).@xcite despite this trend , the finding of a partially ordered ground state in large-@xmath0 theory does _ not _ necessarily translate into a partially ordered ground state within mc simulations .",
    "we find that the classical heisenberg model on both the trillium and distorted windmill lattices shows a first order phase transition to a coplanar magnetically ordered state featuring neighboring spins rotated by 120@xmath4 .",
    "we further show that this model on the trillium lattice does not have a macroscopic ground state degeneracy .",
    "the chosen 120@xmath4 coplanar state is a unique ground state , and the partial order is an artificial effect of the spherical approximation constraint@xcite used in the large-@xmath0 theory@xcite . on the other hand , the selection of a particular coplanar ordering on the distorted windmill lattice proceeds due to an order by disorder mechanism .    in the cooperative paramagnetic state ( for an intermediate temperature regime @xmath5 extending an order of magnitude below the intercept of a curie - weiss fit , @xmath6 ) , we find that the large-@xmath0 description remains quantitatively valid for both lattices , despite the inability of large-@xmath0 theory to capture the true nature of the classical ground state .",
    "that is , calculations of the angle - resolved static structure factor by large-@xmath0 and mc techniques show at most a 5% difference",
    ". we will henceforth refer to this temperature window as the cooperative paramagnetic regime as it features reasonably strong but short range spin correlations , finite temperature remnants of an avoided partial order .",
    "in the next section , we present the structures of the two lattices , and discuss the approaches used to study the magnetic properties of the classical heisenberg model on these lattices .",
    "we show the results of mc simulations on the trillium and distorted windmill lattices in sec .",
    "iii and iv , respectively .",
    "in particular , we focus on the questions addressed above : `` is there a transition to a magnetically ordered state at finite temperatures '' and `` if so , do we find remnants of the partial order above the transition temperature as a result of thermal fluctuations '' .",
    "we also address the mechanism of ordering in these lattices after an enumeration of their ground states .",

    "it was shown in ref .   that the magnetic lattice of mnsi forms a three - dimensional network of corner - sharing equilateral triangles with the cubic p2@xmath113 symmetry shown in fig .  1 ( a ) , which we have named the trillium lattice .",

    ", we have used large-@xmath0 theory for o(@xmath0 ) vector spins and classical mc simulations to study the af heisenberg model on two three - dimensional corner - shared triangle lattices , each site of which belongs to three equilateral triangles .",
    "the large-@xmath0 studies suggested that the geometrical frustration present would lead to a partially ordered state on both lattices .",
    "however , through the minimization of finite size spin clusters , we found the ground state manifolds on these two lattices to be quite different , despite the local similarity between these corner sharing triangle lattice structures . in both cases",
    ", we found that there is a first order transition to a magnetically ordered state using mc methods .",
    "we further showed that the trillium lattice exhibits a unique ground state with a spiral ordering , while the distorted windmill has a macroscopic ground state degeneracy .",
    "magnetic ordering of the classical af heisenberg model on the distorted windmill lattice is therefore seen to arise via an order by disorder mechanism .",
    "the degeneracy of this model on the trillium lattice is seen to be an artificial effect of the soft - constraint of the large-@xmath0 theory .    despite the above",
    "noted differences at low temperatures between large-@xmath0 and mc results , in the cooperative paramagnetic phase above the transition temperature , we find a remarkable resemblance between the respective spin - spin correlations .",
    "this leads us to ask whether the salient features of the large-@xmath0 theory , the angular and directional dependences of the spin - spin correlations found in the partially ordered state obtained by large-@xmath0 theory are present at finite temperatures above the transition temperature .",
    "as true partial order exhibits long range order along particular directions only as @xmath40 , it is not possible to have partial order at any finite temperatures , since the spin - spin correlation decay exponentially at finite temperatures .",
    "this being said , the qualitative directional dependence characteristic of a partially ordered state survives above the transition temperature ( note that the ground state is smoothly connected to the cooperative paramagnetic phase in large-@xmath0 theory ) allowing us to conclude that a  disguised \" partial order has been recovered in the cooperative paramagnetic phase .",

    "to estimate the degeneracy of the ground state , we realize that fixing @xmath41 in table [ tablei ] leaves us with six tilings of the spins in the unit cell , which we might label @xmath42 . here",
    "@xmath43 is taken to be the spin structure as presented in table [ tablei ] , @xmath44 the same taking @xmath45 , and @xmath46 the same taking @xmath47 . in progressing from one unit cell to the next along the ( @xmath48 ) direction , we can follow @xmath49 with either @xmath49 or @xmath50 , @xmath50 can be followed by either @xmath51 or @xmath52 . replacing @xmath53 gives the general rules for allowed spin structures ( provided the number of @xmath18 structures is a multiple of three ) . with these rules",
    ", it becomes a problem in combinatorics to determine the ground state degeneracy .    for simplicity,@xcite let us consider a finite size lattice with @xmath54 unit cells , with @xmath55 divisible by 3 .",
    "clearly we have one state with only @xmath56 spin structures .",
    "by removing three @xmath56 spin structures , we can insert three @xmath57 spin structures in their place , or more generally , removing @xmath58 planes of unit cells which rotate as they progress along the ( @xmath48 ) direction , allows the introduction of @xmath58 planes of spin structures which need not rotate from one plane to the next .",
    "upon such a removal there should be @xmath59 available unit cell planes for @xmath58 equivalent spin structures .",
    "this implies a degeneracy of approximately@xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 can be @xmath62 . summing over @xmath61",
    "then gives the total number of states : @xmath63 so the number of ground states grows exponentially in the linear lattice size , roughly as @xmath64 .",
    "as the structure factor geometrically vanishes at the ordering wavevector in the first brillouin zone , we define the order parameter in terms of the structure factors at equivalent wavevectors @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the trillium and distorted windmill lattices respectively .",
