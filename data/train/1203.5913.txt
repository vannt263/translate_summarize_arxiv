    "in general , the mesons are classified in @xmath22 multiplets .",
    "there are two types of orbitally excited axial - vector mesons , namely @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the former includes @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which compose the @xmath27-nonet , and the latter includes @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which compose the @xmath30-nonet .",
    "there is an important character for these axial - vector mesons except @xmath0 and @xmath1 , that is each different flavor state can mix with one another , which comes from the other nonet meson or the same nonet one .",
    "there is not mix between @xmath0 and @xmath1 because of the opposite c - parities .",
    "they do not also mix with others .",
    "so compared with other axial - vector mesons , these two mesons should have less uncertainties about their inner structures .    like decay modes @xmath31",
    ", the charmless decays @xmath32 also have three polarization states and so are expected to have rich physics . in many",
    "@xmath31 decays , the informations on branching ratios and polarization fractions among various helicity amplitudes have been studied by many authors @xcite . through polarization studies ,",
    "some underling helicity structures of the decay mechanism are proclaimed .",
    "they find that the polarization fractions follow the naive counting rule , that is @xmath33 . in the tree - dominated decay modes , such as @xmath34 , where the @xmath35 is more than @xmath36 .",
    "but if the contribution from the factorizable emission amplitudes is suppressed for some decay modes , this counting rule might be modified in some extent even dramatically by other contributions .",
    "for example , the polarization fractions of the decay @xmath37 are modified by its annihilation contribution .",
    "whether the similar situation also occurs in the @xmath32 decay modes is worth researching by theories and experiments .",
    "we know that @xmath0 has some similar behaves with the vector meson , so one can expect that there should exist some similar characters in the branching ratios and the polarization fractions between decays @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath0 is replaced by its scalar partner @xmath40 . while it is not the case for @xmath1 because of its different characters in decay constant and light - cone distribution amplitude ( lcda ) compared with those of @xmath0 . for example , the longitude decay constant is very small for the charged @xmath1 states and vanishes under the su(3 ) limit .",
    "it is zero for the neutral @xmath41 state . while the transverse decay constant of @xmath0 vanishes under the su(3 ) limit . in the isospin limit ,",
    "the chiral - odd ( -even ) lcdas of meson @xmath1 are symmetric ( antisymmetric ) under the exchange of quark and anti - quark momentum fractions .",
    "it is just contrary to the symmetric behavior for @xmath0 . in view of these differences",
    ", one can expect that there should exist very different results between @xmath38 and @xmath42 . on the experimental side ,",
    "a few of @xmath32 decays are studied , such as @xmath43 @xcite , @xmath44 @xcite , @xmath45 @xcite , @xmath46 @xcite . in most of them only the upper limits for the branching ratios can be available . on the theoretical side",
    ", many charmless @xmath32 decays have been studied by cheng and yang in ref .",
    "@xcite where the branching ratios are very different with those calculated by naive factorization approach @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "the former are more large than the later .",
    "to clarify such large differences is another motivation of this work .    in the following , @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "are denoted as @xmath47 and @xmath48 in some places for convenience .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in sec.[proper ] , decay constants and light - cone distribution amplitudes of the relevant mesons are introduced . in sec.[results ] , we then analyze these decay channels using the pqcd approach .",
    "the numerical results and the discussions are given in sec .",
    "[ numer ] .",
    "the conclusions are presented in the final part .",
    "for the wave function of the heavy b meson , we take _ b(x , b)= ( p / _ b + m_b ) _ 5 _ b ( x , b ) .",
    "[ bmeson ] here only the contribution of lorentz structure @xmath49 is taken into account , since the contribution of the second lorentz structure @xmath50 is numerically small @xcite and has been neglected .",
    "for the distribution amplitude @xmath51 in eq.([bmeson ] ) , we adopt the following model : _ b(x , b)=n_bx^2(1-x)^2 , where @xmath52 is a free parameter , we take @xmath53 gev in numerical calculations , and @xmath54 is the normalization factor for @xmath55 .    the wave function for the pseudoscalar meson @xmath56 , such as @xmath57 meson is given as _ p(p , x,)_5 .where@xmath56 and @xmath58 are the momentum and the momentum fraction of the pseudoscalar meson , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath59 is either @xmath60 or @xmath61 depending on the assignment of the momentum fraction @xmath58 .    in these decays , both the longitudinal and the transverse polarizations are involved for each final meson . for the vector mesons ,",
    "their distribution amplitudes are defined as v(p , ^*_l)||q_2(z)q_1(0)|0&=&^1_0dx e^ixpz[m_v / ^*_l_v(x)+ / ^*_l p / _ v^t(x ) + m_v^s_v(x)]_,v(p , ^*_t)||q_2(z)q_1(0)|0&=&^1_0dx e^ixpz _ , where @xmath62 is the unit vector having the same ( opposite ) direction with the moving of the vector meson and @xmath58 is the momentum fraction of @xmath63 quark .",
