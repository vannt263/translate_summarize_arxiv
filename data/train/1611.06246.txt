    "in this section we will describe a specific combination of atomic structure representations and of analysis techniques that can be used to deal effectively with large databases of materials and molecules .",
    "we will however also briefly summarize some of the alternative approaches that could be used to substitute different components of our tool chain .",
    "the most crucial and basic element in any structural analysis algorithm is to introduce a metric to measure ( dis)similarity between two atomic configurations .",
    "many options are available , with different levels of complexity and generality , starting from the commonly used root mean square ( rms ) distance . in order to deal with symmetry operations or condensed phase structures , several `` fingerprint '' frameworks have been developed @xcite , that assign a unique vector of order parameters to each molecular or crystalline configuration : a metric can then be easily built by taking some norm of the difference between fingerprint vectors .",
    "any of these distances could be taken as the basis of the classification and mapping algorithms that we will describe in what follows .    in this paper",
    "we will use instead a very flexible framework ( rematch - soap ) that is based on the definition of an environment similarity matrix @xmath0 , which contains the complete information on the pair - wise similarity of the environment of each of the atoms within the molecules @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in our framework , the similarity between two local environments @xmath3 and @xmath4 is computed using the soap kernel  @xcite @xmath5 the rematch kernel is then defined as the following weighted combination of the elements of @xmath6 @xmath7 where the optimal combination is obtained by searching over the doubly stochastic matrices @xmath8 the one that minimizes the discrepancy between matching pairs of environments subject to a regularization based on the matrix information - entropy @xmath9  @xcite . once a kernel between two configurations has been defined , it is then possible to introduce a kernel distance @xmath10 that we will use as the metric for representing and clustering structures from a database .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the choice of a soap kernel as the definition of an environment similarity provides at the same time great generality ",
    "it can be seamlessly applied to both molecules and solids  and elbowroom for fine - tuning  ranging from setting an appropriate cutoff distance to circumscribe an environment to the introduction of an alchemical similarity kernel that translates the notion that different chemical species can behave similarly with respect to the properties of interest .",
    "the dissimilarity between the @xmath11 atomic configurations in a database contains a large amount of information on the structural relations between the database items .",
    "however , this information is not readily interpretable , as it is encoded as a @xmath12 matrix of numbers .",
    "several methods are available to process dissimilarity information into a form that can be understood more intuitively .",
    "a first approach involves building a low - dimensional `` map '' , where each point corresponds to one of the structures in the database and where the ( euclidean ) distances between points represents the information on the pairwise dissimilarity matrix .",
    "several methods have been proposed over the years to solve this dimensionality reduction problem , starting from principal component analysis @xcite and the equivalent linear multi - dimensional scaling  @xcite , and proceeding to non - linear generalizations of the idea , such as isomap  @xcite , diffusion maps  @xcite , kernel pca  @xcite . in this manuscript , we will use sketchmap  @xcite , a method in which one iteratively optimizes the objective function @xmath13- f\\left[d(x_i , x_j)\\right]\\right]^2 , \\label{eq : smap}\\ ] ] that measures the mismatch of the dissimilarity between atomic configurations @xmath14 with the dissimilarity ( typically just the euclidean distance ) between the corresponding low - dimensional projections @xmath15 .",
    "the procedure is very similar to multi - dimensional scaling , except for the appearance of the transformations @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which are non - linear sigmoid functions of the form : @xmath18 the non - linear transformation focuses the optimization of [ eq : smap ] on the most significant distances ( typically those of the order of @xmath19 ) , and disregards local distortions ( e.g. induced by thermal fluctuations or by incomplete convergence of a geometry optimization ) and the relation between completely unrelated portions of configuration landscape .",
    "the maps that we report in this work will be labeled synthetically using the notation ` \\sigma - a_b - a_b ` , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the exponents used for the high - dimensional function @xmath16 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the exponents for the low - dimensional function @xmath17 , and @xmath19 the threshold for the switching function .",
    "the choice of these parameters of the sigmoid functions are discussed in detail elsewhere  @xcite . in practice @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath21 have relatively small effect on the projection , and can be optimized and kept fixed for systems belonging to the same family . since the structures we consider here are minimum - energy configurations , and there are no thermal fluctuations that should be filtered out , we set @xmath22 ( so that at short range the algorithm will still try to represent distances faithfully ) and set the long - range exponents to @xmath23 .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 is the one to which sketchmap is most sensitive , and needs to be tuned for each system separately . to automate the process of building sketchmaps of large amount of subsets of the database , we have used a simple heuristic procedure for determining the value of @xmath19 automatically . following the prescriptions in ref .",
    "@xcite , we first compute the histogram of distances in the dissimilarity matrix of each molecular set , and detect the dissimilarity value ( @xmath24 ) corresponding to the peak value of the histogram . we then set the value of @xmath19 to @xmath25 .",
    "as we will demonstrate below , sketchmap provides a remarkably informative two - dimensional representation of structures in a data set , making it possible to identify groups of similar configurations , outliers , as well as to investigate structure - property relations . an alternative approach to navigate",
    "a set of structures based on the dissimilarity matrix is to use clustering algorithms , that identify groups of objects having similar properties to hint at the presence of recurring motifs underlying the behavior of the system .",
    "a considerable number of clustering algorithms have been developed over the last few decades  @xcite , including connectivity models @xcite ( i.e. hierarchical clustering ) , centroid models @xcite (",
    "i.e. k - means algorithm ) and density based models @xcite .",
    "clustering models based on connectivity information such as hierarchical ( or agglomerative ) clustering @xcite are particularly suited for this purpose and we will focus only on this type of clustering in this paper . starting from each configurations as its own cluster , the hierarchical clustering algorithms iteratively aggregate clusters together based on some assessment of their similarity .",
    "similarity between two individual structures can be obviously measured by their distance @xmath26 .",
    "the distance between two _ clusters _",
    ", however , can be defined in many different ways . in our study , we will use in particular the rms dissimilarity between the pair of members of the two clusters . the linkage distance @xmath27 between two clusters @xmath28 and",
    "@xmath29 is then defined as : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the total number of configurations within each cluster .",
    "@xmath33 is the dissimilarity between the two configurations , as computed e.g. from the rematch - soap kernel .",
    "the complexity of this type of clustering ( @xmath34 ) is relatively cheaper than dimensionality reduction algorithms like sketchmap ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "both procedures can be greatly accelerated by selecting a subset of the configurations ( e.g. by farthest point sampling , with the possibility of weighting based on density information  @xcite ) which is then subject to either dimensionality reduction or hierarchical clustering .",
    "the results of a hierarchical clustering procedure can be represented in a `` dendrogram '' plot , that conveys visually the sequence of agglomerative clustering operations and the linkage distance at each step .",
    "the x - axis represents the index of the structures , sorted in a way so that at each stage the clusters being joint are adjacent .",
    "each merge operation is represented by a line joining the two underlying clusters , with the @xmath36 position of the line representing the linkage distance for that pair , as defined by [ eq : dendist ] . in this kind of representation , at the bottom of the dendrogram ,",
    "each structure can be thought of as an individual cluster containing only one item .",
    "clusters are then merged iteratively , selecting at each step the pair of clusters that are closest to each other .",
    "this operation is repeated until all the clusters collapse into one single group that encompasses all the structures in the database , thus completing the dendrogram . to avoid overcrowding the bottom of the plot",
    ", one can hide the part that corresponds to very small linkage distances , while still graphically visualising the size of the clusters by drawing bars that encompass the associated structures .",
    "since the `` leaves '' of this dendrogram correspond to individual configurations , it is possible to complement the dendrogram with color - coded bar plots that represent the value of different properties of each structure , thereby giving a clear picture of the relation between structural clustering and the different properties .    in order to understand the basic motifs of a particular cluster @xmath37",
    ", it is very useful to select one of its structures that is as representative as possible of the entire subset . in case where stability estimates are available ,",
    "such structure may be the lowest - energy structure in the cluster . for a definition that is based purely on conformational or configurational information , the most representative structure @xmath38",
    "could be defined , as the item having the minimum mean square dissimilarity with respect to all other members of @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath39 .        \\label{eq : rep - struc}\\ ] ]    representative structures can be defined at each level of the hierarchy , and can therefore be very useful in navigating the database , and understanding what are its most crucial structural features .",
    "the spread of the cluster around @xmath38 , @xmath40 can be used to quantify the range of structural landscape that is covered by the cluster .",
    "another important aspect of database analysis is ` outlier detection '  @xcite .",
    "an `` outlier '' configuration is defined as a configuration which is different from most of the configurations in the database .",
    "outlier configurations are very important as they are likely to have unique structural motif in the whole database and are thus interesting for structure prediction applications .",
    "they also could represent chemical changes or indicate inconsistent configurations which are likely to be `` errors '' in the database .    in the following sections",
    ", we will present examples of how these different analyses can be applied to different subsets of structures taken from a database of amino acid and dipeptide conformers .",
    "this work is based on a first - principles derived structure / energy data set with conformers of twenty proteinogenic amino acids and dipeptides , as well as their interactions with a series of divalent cations@xcite ( ca@xmath41 , ba@xmath41 , sr@xmath41 , cd@xmath41 , pb@xmath41 , hg@xmath41 ) .",
    "the potential - energy surfaces ( pes ) of 280 systems were explored in a wide relative energy range of up to 4ev ( 390kj / mol ) , summing up to an overall of 45,892 stationary points on the respective potential - energy surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the underlying energetics were calculated by applying density - functional theory ( dft ) in the generalized gradient approximation corrected for long - range van der waals interactions@xcite ( pbe+vdw ) .",
    "a number of theory - theory and theory - experiment comparisons have shown the applicability of the method to amino acid and peptide systems  @xcite . such dominantly manually curated data is a great starting point for studying materials and molecules across chemical space  @xcite , yet automated techniques are needed to extract unbiased and hypothesis - free trends and to check consistency of the underlying data .    in this study",
    "we focus on the amino acid lysine ( in short lys ) and investigate basic structural motifs of three forms , see fig .",
    "[ fig : lysines ] .",
    "furthermore , the machine learning techniques introduced in this work are used to detect the impact of perturbations ( here ca@xmath41 cations ) on the structural properties of the unperturbed systems .",
    "finally , we demonstrate how the approach can also be applied to discover inconsistencies and outliers in the database .",
    "hierarchical classifications and sketchmap projections for all the proteinogenic amino acids in the database are given in the supporting information .",
    "we take as our first example a subset of the database containing 2080 conformers of lysine dipeptide .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , we start by constructing the ( dis)similarity matrix using the soap - rematch kernel . in",
    "[ fig : lys - dipep ] the dendrogram plot as well as sketchmaps have been shown along with five properties , energy and four dihedral angles , using the same color scales in both the sketchmap and dendrogram representations . in the sketchmap",
    "each circular ` disk ' represents a conformer .",
    "whereas in the case of the dendrogram plot , structures are represented by vertical lines at the bottom of the plot .",
    "the strong correlation between energy and conformational parameters on one side , and clustering and position on the map on the other , testifies how the the rematch - soap kernel induces a meaningful classification of the structures in this dataset .",
    "while both clustering and sketchmap show clearly that the dataset is composed of groups of structurally - related conformers , the agnostic nature of the underlying metric does not disclose immediately the structural features that most transparently differentiate between different clusters .",
    "comparing the representative structures from the main clusters allowed us to quickly identify candidate structural motifs that could be used to rationalize the layout of the conformational landscape . by color - coding the dendrogram and the sketchmaps according to these indicators one can readily highlight the key correlations . when considering existing literature on the stability of oligopeptides , the two structural parameters that are most often considered as the key coordinates to navigate the conformational landscape are the ramachandran dihedral angles and , that determine the structure of the backbone around the side chain bearing c atom  @xcite under the assumption of peptide bonds being solely in _ trans _ conformation .",
    "while fine - grained clusters are clearly homogeneous with respect to the and angles , it is clear that for the present systems they are not those that determine the clear - cut branching at the top of the dendrogram .",
    "an analysis of the representative structures for the two main clusters ( a ) and ( b ) shows that the two molecules differ by the isomerization of the n - terminal peptide bond .",
    "further splitting of these two clusters , i.e. ( a ) into clusters ( d ) and ( e ) , and ( b ) into ( f ) and ( g ) , depends on the isomerization of the c - terminal peptide bond .",
    "we can confirm this attribution of the main features of the dataset by color - coding the map and the dendrogram following the dihedral angles @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the four main clusters are largely homogeneous with respect to peptide bond isomerization , and are then further subdivided based on and .",
    "this observation deserves some further comment .",
    "peptide bonds in naturally - occurring proteins are believed to almost exclusively exist in _",
    "trans _ conformation with the exception of prolyl peptide bonds where a smaller energy difference to _",
    "trans _ increases the chance for _ cis _ onformers@xcite .",
    "this view is supported by the analysis of protein structures deposited in the protein databases where _ cis _ conformations are found for about 5% of the prolyl peptide bonds , but less than 0.1% for the others@xcite .",
    "x - ray crystallographic structure represent however merely frozen snapshots of structural dynamics . the _ ab initio _ structure search protocol , instead , does consider the peptide bond torsions as variable and intentionally allowed simulations to overcome the isomerization barrier .",
    "consequently , the dataset contains representatives of all four combinations of _ cis _ and _ trans _ conformers .",
    "since these transitions are strongly bimodal , and reflect in significant changes of the favorable side chain conformations , they constitute the most significant feature to classify the conformers .",
    "as expected , the most stable conformers are largely in a _ trans_-_trans _ conformation .",
    "however , the large parts of conformational space of that is occupied by conformers with 1 or 2 _ cis _ peptide bonds suggests that _ cis _ isomers might play a role in the dynamics of peptides and proteins .",
    "if the analysis had been performed solely under the assumption of the importance of the ramachandran and dihedrals , it would have missed one of the main features of the structural landscape that is critical to characterize the relation between structure and energetics .",
    "one could then proceed further with the analysis , focusing for instance on small clusters containing low - energy structures such as that represented by the conformer ( c ) .",
    "all the structure in this group are _",
    "trans_-_trans _ isomers , that in addition have @xmath44 degrees and @xmath45 degrees , allowing for the formation of a h - bond between the side chain @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and a favorable arrangement of the @xmath48 donating a h - bond to the carbonyl @xmath49 as shown in  [ fig : lys - dipep ] . having access to the combined information on energetics , and on the grouping of structures with similar geometry",
    "makes it easier to rationalize the energy ordering of the structures , without having to separately juxtapose all of the low - lying conformers but focusing on a few representative structures .          as the second example we considered a dataset containing 897 conformers of gas phase protonated lysine dipeptide .",
    "we follow the same steps as described in the previous example in order to find the most basic structural motifs for this system .",
    "[ fig : hcluster - lysh ] shows the dendrogram , the sketchmap and a few color coded properties for this system to show their correlation with the classification .",
    "the most prominent feature for this molecule , which is evident in both the dendrogram and the sketch maps , is the presence of a group of outliers , that are clearly separated from the bulk of the conformers .",
    "inspection of the cluster centroid ( g ) clarifies the structural basis of this separation . whereas in most of the structures",
    "the excess charge lies on the lysine side chain as a nh@xmath50 group , conformers in this cluster experienced a proton transfer event , with the excess proton attached to one of the carbonyl oxygen @xmath49 , stabilized by h - bonding to @xmath48 .",
    "this is a result of the database generation where _ ab initio _ replica - exchange molecular dynamics including high t trajectories where used for structure sampling during which protons can eventually transfer .",
    "moving on to the main cluster of structures , we can see that similar to our previous example of the neutral dipeptide and again due to the unbiased sampling protocol and the high energy range the peptide bond angles are again more important than ramachandran s dihedrals .",
    "conformers ( a ) and ( b ) are the representative structure for groups having _ cis _ and _ trans _",
    "@xmath43 peptide bonds respectively .",
    "group ( a ) is further split based on the _ cis / trans _ state of @xmath42 into the clusters represented by structures ( d ) and ( e ) .",
    "the presence of a charged side chain leads to stronger h - bonds and to less clear - cut grouping based on peptide - bond isomerism than for the neutral dipeptide .",
    "this is apparent for instance from the presence of subclusters such as that represented by conformer ( f ) , in which the bent side chain leads to the formation of two h - bonds between nh@xmath50 group and the carbonyl oxygens .",
    "h - bonds also dominate the partitioning of cluster ( b ) , that is split into two groups  one of which is still best represented by the same conformer , and one that is epitomised by ( c ) .",
    "once again , inspection of these structural representatives reveals the organising principle behind the classification : ( c)-like structures have an extended side chain , and are dominated by interactions among the peptide bond moieties , whereas ( b)-like structures have a well - formed h - bond between the side chain and one of the two backbone o atoms . this structural pattern can be emphasized by color - coding conformers based on the parameter @xmath51@xmath52 $ ] : a small o - n distance indicates bending of the side chain and the formation of a h - bond between o and n. as it is clear from the sketchmap representation , there is a very strong correlation between the bending of the charged side chain and the energy of a conformer , with all of the structures within 0.5  ev of the ground state feature this sidechain to backbone h - bonds .",
    "a scenario with such a clear - cut partitioning is less likely to happen with oligopeptides in a polar solvent like water , where intramolecular h - bonds that introduce strain compete with h - bonds with the surrounding water molecules , without the need of bending the structure .",
    "the analysis techniques we introduce in this work would be ideally suited to rationalize the changes in the ( free ) energetics of biological molecules when moving from the gas phase to ( micro)solvated environments or to organic / inorganic interfaces .",
    "our third example is a dataset containing 733 conformers of the un - capped lysine molecule in the gas phase .",
    "we follow the same steps as described in the previous examples to construct the dendrogram shown in [ fig : hcluster - lysuncapped ] .",
    "the map has a simple structure , with few well - separated groups .",
    "being a smaller molecule with fewer degrees of freedom , the ramachandran angles are not defined . still , the dihedral angles in the vicinity of the @xmath53 atom display local structural correlation but once again they are not the main organizing factor that can rationalize the clustering . by juxtaposing representative conformers from the main clusters we could identify a better order parameter , that correlates strongly with h - bond patterns within the molecule .",
    "namely , the distance ( @xmath54 ) between the h atom in the @xmath55 group of the carboxy function and the @xmath56 atom in the backbone ( @xmath57 ) discriminates well between structures based on h - bonding patterns@xcite of _ type  i _ between @xmath57@xmath58@xmath59@xmath60 ( e.g. conformer ( b ) ) and of _ type  ii _ with a h - bond @xmath49@xmath58@xmath59@xmath57 ( e.g. conformer ( a ) ) .",
    "it can be seen from both the dendrogram and the sketchmaps that one could identify several further subgroups based on particular values of @xmath54 , representing specific orientations .",
    "conformers ( c ) and ( d ) represent small groups of conformers having specific relative orientation between the oh and @xmath61 groups .",
    "conformer ( e ) is representative of a small outlier group with a well - defined bend of the side chain , leading to the formation of a further h - bond between the @xmath57 atom in the amino acid moiety and @xmath48 , in the side chain .",
    "the lysine side chain is very flexible , and the distance between @xmath56 and @xmath53 only plays a role in defining the fine - grained structure of the dataset , but is minimally correlated with the most prominent features .        while it appears that even in this case we could identify the basic structural motifs that characterize the conformational landscape of this system , the correlation with energy is very poor .",
    "there are several instances in both the dendrogram and the sketchmap where two conformers that are detected as structurally very similar while they display very different stability .",
    "understanding whether this inconsistency signals a problem with our analysis brings us to the topic of outlier detection and consistency checks , that we will discuss in details in section  [ sec : outliers ] .      having elucidated the essential structural motifs that underlie the organization of a set of molecular conformers",
    ", one could also wonder how changes in the thermodynamic conditions , or another external perturbation such as solvation , the addition or subtraction of an electron  @xcite or that of an atom  @xcite , modify the conformations of the molecule and their stability .",
    "the database@xcite that we are using here as an example contains , in addition to bare oligopeptides , sets of locally - stable conformers in the presence of cations of six different species , namely , , , , and .",
    "we take the example of to describe how one can characterize its impact on the conformational space of the three molecular systems that we have discussed in our previous examples .",
    "we start by calculating the dissimilarity of all the conformers containing cations with their pure counterpart . in order to make the comparison on the same footings , we did not include the location of the cation in defining the soap kernels , so that the presence of only enters by distorting molecular geometries and/or altering their relative stability . using this information",
    ", we then projected the cation - containing dataset on the top of the sketchmap of structures for the bare molecule .",
    "this is done using sketchmap out - of - sample embedding , and we refer our reader to see the relevant literature  @xcite for more details about the method . in [ fig : smap - ca ] we show the resulting projection , colored according to the stability of the conformers , on top of the sketchmap of the pure molecule shown in grey color as a reference .",
    "a close proximity of projected conformers with a pure conformer signifies their structural similarity .",
    "segregation of the projected conformers with the cation in some area of the reference sketchmap , represents the structural bias introduced by the strong electrostatic interaction with .    in the case of neutral lysine dipeptide ( [ fig : smap - ca]-a ) , the presence of the ca@xmath41 ion induces overall relatively small distortions of the stable conformers , that get pushed towards the outer region of the map but are still clearly related to the locally stable structures for the bare molecule .",
    "energies are dramatically changed , with the most stable cluster in the original map begin completely absent in the presence of the cation .",
    "these observations highlight the importance of sampling high - energy conformers during high - throughput structure searches , since the relative stability can be modulated strongly by external perturbations .",
    "in particular , _ cis _ conformers become energetically more competitive and are topologically closer to the global minima . in the case of protonated lysine dipeptide ( [ fig : smap - ca]-b ) , the same analysis shows an even clearer pattern .",
    "all the conformers with ions are projected in the lower part of the sketchmap , that correspond to conformers with an extended side chain ( see [ fig : hcluster - lysh ] ) .",
    "the ion preferably binds to the peptide @xmath62 atoms , and the electrostatic repulsion with the protonated lysine residue strongly favors extended conformers , contrary to what observed in the case of the bare molecule .",
    "finally , one sees that for molecular lysine ( [ fig : smap - ca]-c ) the addition of ca@xmath41 leads to conformers with very different structural motifs from those seen with the bare molecule , which is apparent in the sketchmap projection being concentrated far away from the unperturbed conformers .",
    "in fact , inspection of the structures shows that in most cases ca@xmath41 triggers the transition to the zwitterionic form , with the cation coupled to the carboxylate group , and the side chain protonated nh@xmath63 extending as far as possible away from it . in analogy with what observed for lennard - jones clusters  @xcite and solvated polypeptide segments  @xcite , sketchmaps proved to be a powerful tool to analyze the response of the system to external perturbations and changes in the boundary conditions , and  in this specific example  do draw connections between different subsets of a high - throughput molecular database .",
    "the tools we introduced in this work are useful to address other important issues in data - driven science , such as outlier detection and consistency checks .",
    "we have already discussed the importance of detecting groups of `` outlier '' structures that are very different from the bulk of the dataset .",
    "these unusual items often signal the occurrence of unexpected effects that go beyond the original goal of the database construction effort . in the case of protonated lysine dipeptide , looking for outliers allowed us to reveal the presence of conformers with different chemical connectivity , or of strong h - bonds between the backbone and the charged side chain .",
    "similar observations can also be made in the case of the bare lysine molecule ( [ fig : hcluster - lysuncapped ] ) .",
    "also in this case , one can observe a branch at the topmost level of the dendrogram , containing only two conformers .",
    "these are the only two cases where a h - bond is formed between the @xmath56 of the side chain and the @xmath58 atom of the @xmath55 group in the backbone . in the sketchmap ,",
    "these two conformers are projected on the top , clearly isolated from rest of the groups , and bear the most resemblance to the zwitterionic conformers that are stabilized in the presence of a divalent cation .",
    "obviously , the definition of a group of `` outliers '' can be more nuanced , and refer to small groups of structures appearing at deeper levels in the hierarchy .",
    "overall , the possibility of clustering together the structures in a large dataset and inspect a few representative conformers , rather than hundreds or thousands , greatly facilitates the task of identifying trends and spotting interesting or unexpected structures .    , and the conformational energy , @xmath64 .",
    "the outliers of uncapped lysine ( b ) were manually highlighted in orange.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    outliers can signal interesting or important trends , but can also be a red flag for the presence of errors .",
    "the importance of database integrity has long been recognized by computer scientists  @xcite , and several tools are available to monitor and correct inconsistencies from the technical point of view , in terms of reliability of storing and retrieving data@xcite .",
    "the issue is also crucial when it comes to the maintenance of automatically - generated databases , and to repositories that store data of heterogeneous provenance@xcite . in these cases ,",
    "problems have generally little to do with the integrity of the storage , but rather with the consistency of the simulation details of different sets of calculations .",
    "inconsistencies should here manifest themselves in the presence of structures that are geometrically very similar , but are associated to very different values of particular properties .",
    "for example the lysine molecule dataset shows signs of this kind of issues , with energies that vary wildly within clusters that are very homogeneous in structure .",
    "this problem can be seen from the maps , i.e. when comparing the energy - colored sketchmap in [ fig : hcluster - lysuncapped ] to the respective maps for the other systems .",
    "however , a more robust and easy - to - automate approach to identify structure / property inconsistencies starts from the hierarchical clusters , and compares the structural variability within each cluster @xmath65 ( [ eq : sigma - x ] ) with the variance of a given property , in this case energy , @xmath66 .",
    "looking , for example , at a glassy energy landscape@xcite , one can observe configurations that are very different from a structural point of view , but have similar energy , giving rise to clusters with large @xmath65 and small @xmath66 .",
    "the data points in [ fig : consistency ] each represent individual clusters of lysine dipeptide and uncapped lysine , respectively , and illustrate their variation in energy and structure . in the case of lysine dipeptide ( [ fig : consistency]a )",
    "one sees a clear correlation between the structural and energetical variation of the clusters .",
    "the two quantities @xmath65 and @xmath66 are not necessarily strongly correlated , but in general clusters that contain very similar structures also have a low spread in energy . for uncapped lysine ( [ fig : consistency]b ) , however , one can identify a group of points ( which we manually highlighted in orange for clarity ) that has a distinctively different behavior , with @xmath66 converging to a constant value other than zero as @xmath65 decreases .",
    "this kind of feature indicates that the metric that is used to classify structures can not detect one specific effect that has a dramatic impact on energetics , signaling either a failure of the metric or , as in this case , an inconsistency in the generated data .",
    "further investigation of the lysine molecule dataset revealed that a subset of structures that had been generated at a lower level of theory in the initial stages of the structure - search procedure made their way by mistake into the final dataset . using this measure of cluster homogeneity on all systems of the amino acid database ( see supporting information ) revealed similar problems also for other molecules , for example cys , glu , and arg .",
    "thanks to this analysis we will be able to identify and rectify mistakes in all the affected datasets and subsequently update the on - line repository@xcite .",
    "the increasing use of high - throughput computational screening of materials and molecules , and the compilations of more - or - less curated databases of the resulting structures and properties , is making more and more urgent to adapt `` big data '' techniques to the problems that are specific to this field . in this work",
