    "in spintronics , spin current , which is conventionally defined as the difference of electric currents of spin - up and spin - down conduction electrons , plays a pivotal role in propagating spin information from one place to another .",
    "many spin dependent properties , such as giant magnetoresistance @xcite , spin transfer torques slonczewski , berger and spin hall effect @xcite , are directly related to spin current .",
    "spin current has several unique properties compared to charge current : 1 ) it is considered as a flow of angular momentum while the conventional current is a flow of charge , 2 ) the total spin current is not a conserved quantity even in the steady state condition ; it can be transferred and/or lost due to spin - dependent scattering , and 3 ) spin current has both transverse and longitudinal components whose decaying length scales are quite different in a ferromagnetic medium .",
    "recently , the concept of spin current has been extended to spin wave current since spin waves carry angular momenta as well @xcite .",
    "there are two types of spin wave currents .",
    "one is magnetostatic wave propagation kajiwara10,xiao12,wu11,nowak11,wang11 for which the classical magnetization is temporal and spatially dependent .",
    "an example is a moving domain wall driven by a magnetic field or by an electric current .",
    "although such magnetostatic spin waves may carry angular momentum , they are not quasi - particles in that there are no particle numbers associated with these waves .",
    "the other spin wave current is a true quasi - particle current known as magnon current .",
    "a magnon is a quantum object ( particle ) that represents low excitation state of ferromagnets . in equilibrium ,",
    "the number of magnons @xmath0 can be cast into a simple boson distribution @xmath1^{-1}$ ] where @xmath2 is the magnon energy .",
    "similar to the electron spin , each magnon carries an angular momentum @xmath3 . in thermal equilibrium",
    ", there is no magnon current since there are an equal number of magnons moving in all directions .    in our earlier paper @xcite",
    ", we showed that the non - equilibrium magnon accumulation and magnon current can be treated semiclassically , similar to the spin transport properties of conduction electrons .",
    "we found that the non - equilibrium electron spin current in metal can convert into a magnon current of a magnetic insulator through the interfacial exchange interaction .",
    "the magnon current then subsequently diffuses inside the magnetic insulator .",
    "the magnon diffusion process may be described by the diffusion equation . among other things",
    ", we predicted that an electric current applied in one metallic layer can induce an electric current in another metallic layer separated by a magnetic insulator via magnon mediated angular momentum transfer . in this paper , we extend our theory to include a general boundary condition for the spin convertibility at metal@xmath4magnetic - insulator interfaces and then , we calculate the electric drag in a few realizations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we summarize the general boundary conditions at the interfaces between metals and magnetic insulators . in particular , we introduce a quantity , named as spin convertance , which quantitatively characterizes conversion effectiveness among spin / magnon accumulation and magnon / spin current at a magnetic interface . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the spin convertance by using the microscopic s - d exchange interaction . in sec .",
    "iv , we present the general solutions for several layered structures with a magnetic insulator layer ( mil ) and discuss some limiting cases . finally , we summarize our results .",
    "we consider a simple bilayer consisting of a metallic layer in contact with a mil . the angular momentum in a metal is carried by conduction electrons while in a mil , it is carried by magnons . in the semiclassical approximation ,",
    "spin transport properties can be described by the boltzmann distributions of electrons and magnons @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions are to link the non - equilibrium electron distribution function of the metal to the magnon distribution function of the mil . within the model of the s - d exchange interaction (",
    "see sec .",
    "iii ) , the total angular momentum is conserved and thus for an ideal interface the first boundary condition would be @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the total angular momentum current , and we assign the interface at @xmath7 . if we consider the left layer as a non - magnetic metal ( @xmath8 ) , the angular momentum is carried by conduction electrons only and thus @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the conventional spin current density .",
    "for the mil on the right , the angular momentum is carried by magnons only and thus @xmath11 where @xmath12 corresponds to the magnon current density .",
    "therefore , we may rewrite eq .",
    "( 1 ) as @xmath13 note that for a magnetic metal , both spin and magnon current contribute to the total angular momentum current .",
    "the second boundary condition is the relation among the electron spin accumulation @xmath14 , the magnon accumulation @xmath15 , and the total angular momentum current @xmath16 , @xmath17 where the two coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 will be calculated within the s - d model in the next section .",
    "the physics of this boundary condition is rather transparent : the first term represents the generation of the magnon current in the presence of electron spin accumulation and the second term describes the spin current produced by magnon accumulation .",
    "the combination of these two processes at the interface yields the total interface spin current .",
    "we immediately note that eq .",
    "( 3 ) is analogous to the case of spin current between two metallic layers in which the boundary condition is @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the spin dependent chemical potential ( @xmath22 or @xmath23 corresponds to spin - up ( down ) ) which is proportional to spin accumulation , and @xmath24 characterizes the interfacial spin conductance @xcite . with this analogy",
    ", we may identify the coefficients @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) as the interface conductance for the conversion of the spin ( magnon ) accumulation to the magnon ( spin ) current ; we simply call @xmath18 and @xmath19 _ spin convertance _ for convenience hereafter .",
    "we point out that the boundary condition , eq .  ( 3 ) , is different from what we proposed in the earlier paper @xcite where we related the spin and magnon accumulation via a local magnetic susceptibility .",
    "clearly , such approximation corresponds to an ideal case in which the interface spin resistance is zero or the spin convertance is infinite . in the next section",
    ", we shall calculate these spin convertances and show that they are in fact finite and thus the magnon mediated electric drag effect predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite was overestimated by one order of magnitude .",
    "we start with the s - d exchange coupling at a metal@xmath4mil interface , @xmath25where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) are the creation ( annihilation ) operators for spin - up and spin spin - down electrons respectively , @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for magnons , @xmath32 is the spin per atom of the mil , and @xmath33 is the number of atomic spins of the mil at the interface . the exchange coupling strength @xmath34 is given by the exchange integral with the overlapped wavefunctions of the conduction electrons and the magnetic ions .",
    "since we do not know the detailed orbitals for the interface states , the magnitude of @xmath34 at interface is less known compared to that in bulk materials and we will treat it as a parameter .",
    "the above exchange interaction gives rise to angular momentum transfer between the electron spins at the metallic side and the magnons at the mil side . in equilibrium ,",
    "the net spin current across the interface is zero . at non - equilibrium",
    "when there is a spin accumulation at @xmath35 or a magnon accumulation at @xmath36 , a net magnon / spin current may be present across the interface . in fig .  1 , we illustrate two angular momentum transfer processes .",
    "the total angular momentum current across the interface should be caused by both processes .",
    "we shall calculate them separately below .",
    "mil interface .",
    "the upper ( lower ) panel describes magnon current @xmath37 ( spin current @xmath38 ) generated by spin accumulation @xmath39 ( magnon accumulation @xmath40 ) at the interface.,width=302 ]    magnon current generated by spin accumulation at the interface is defined as @xmath41 \\right\\rangle\\]]where @xmath42 refers to the thermal averaging over all states and @xmath43 is the area of the interface . by explicitly working out the above commutator and by using the fermi - golden rule , we have @xmath44 \\delta ( \\varepsilon _ { \\mathbf{k}}+e_{q}-\\varepsilon _ { % \\mathbf{k}\\prime } ) \\]]where @xmath0 and @xmath45 are the magnon and electron distribution functions respectively .",
    "we have considered a rough interface such that there is no correlation between the electron and magnon momenta for the magnon emission / absorption processes ( i.e. , we do not impose @xmath46 ) .",
    "we first consider the process in the upper panel of fig .  1 , i.e. , magnon current due to electron spin accumulation .",
    "accordingly , we take the equilibrium distribution function for magnons , i.e. , @xmath47^{-1}$ ] where the spin - wave energy is @xmath48 , the exchange stiffness is associated with the curie temperature via @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the spin wave gap due to magnetic anisotropy .",

    "( 6 ) , we arrive at @xmath56where we have defined @xmath57 as the spin accumulation with @xmath58 being the interface electron density of states at fermi level .",

    "if a parabolic magnon dispersion is assumed , then the dominant temperature dependence of @xmath18 is @xmath65 .",
    "the above result has already been obtained in @xcite .",
    "the spin current induced by magnon accumulation at the metal@xmath4mil interface can be similarly calculated .",
    "we define this interface spin current as @xmath66 \\right\\rangle .\\]]after working out the ensured commutator , we find the spin current has exactly the same expression as eq .",
    "( 6 ) ; this is not surprising because the s - d interaction conserves the total angular momenta . to evaluate the spin current induced by magnon accumulation",
    "( see the process displayed in the lower panel of fig .  1 )",
    ", we replace the electron distribution by the equilibrium value , @xmath67 , and separate the magnon density into equilibrium and non - equilibrium ingredients @xmath68 .",
    "we then find from eq .",
    "( 10 ) , @xmath69where @xmath70 is defined as the magnon accumulation . the spin convertance can be expressed as @xmath71with @xmath72where we have replaced the non - equilibrium magnon energy by the average magnon energy @xmath73 by assuming a near equilibrium magnon distribution .",
    "a rough estimation for simple parabolic bands of both magnons and electrons gives @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the fermi temperature of the metal layer .    by combining eq .",
    "( 8) and ( 11 ) , we attain eq .",
    "( 3 ) with the spin convertances @xmath18 and @xmath19 given by eqs .  ( 9 ) and",
    "to experimentally realize the conversion between spin current and magnon current and to quantify the spin convertance , one needs to create a non - equilibrium condition such that a spin current or a magnon current can be generated , manipulated , and more critically , detected .",
    "the non - equilibrium states may be created in several ways . in this section ,",
    "we study both electrical injection into a metal layer and thermal gradient across a mil . in fig .  2 , we show three hypothetical devices to explicitly demonstrate the magnon - mediated electrical drag .    mil@xmath4 nm trilayers , ( b ) mm@xmath4mil@xmath4 mm trilayers , and ( c ) nm@xmath4mil bilayers . in ( a ) and ( b )",
    ", a spin current is generated by an injected electric current via spin hall effect , while in ( c ) , a magnon current is induced by applying a thermal gradient . in all three cases , the magnetization directions of the mil and the magnetic metal ( mm ) layers are oriented in @xmath76.,width=604 ]      in fig .",
    "2(a ) , a magnetic insulator layer ( mil ) is sandwiched between two non - magnetic metal ( nm ) layers . by applying an in - plane electrical current in the nm1 layer",
    ", a spin current flowing perpendicular to the layers would be generated due to the spin hall effect . in this geometry",
    ", a partial spin current would flow into the mil via transfer of spin current to magnon current .",
    "if the magnon diffusion length is larger than the thickness of the mil , the magnon current would reach the other side of the mil and subsequently , converts back to spin current in the nm2 layer .",
    "finally , an electric current parallel to the layer is generated owing to the inverse spin hall effect saitoh06 .",
    "such an electric drag phenomenon , namely , an electric current in one nm layer induces an electric current in the other when the two nm layers are separated by a mil , would be a proof of the magnon / spin current conversion at magnetic interfaces .",

    "the physical principle is that the combined actions of the spin hall and the inverse spin hall are to reduce the original driving current .",
    "now consider the trilayer system .",
    "since the spin current injected into the nm2 layer remains parallel to the spin current in the nm1 layer , the electric drag current in the nm2 layer must be antiparallel to the applied electric current in the nm1 layer .",
    "for three different magnon diffusion lengths of the mil ( yig ) .",
    "see the main text for the parameters used in the figure.,width=302 ]      next , we consider a trilayer structure where the two metallic layers are magnetic , as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) . since the direct contact between the magnetic metal ( mm ) layer and",
    "the mil would make it difficult to rotate the magnetization of each layer independently , one may insert a thin non - magnetic layer at the interface to break direct magnetic coupling .",
    "when an in - plane current is applied to the mm1 layer , an anomalous hall current perpendicular to the layers is generated if the magnetization is oriented in the @xmath137-axis .",
    "although the physics of anomalous hall and spin hall effects are the same , the anomalous hall current has both spin and charge currents .",
    "the charge current , however , is unable to penetrate the mil ; this leads to a charge accumulation at the interface so that the net charge current is exactly zero in the steady state .",
    "the spin current , on the other hand , is able to propagate into the mil via the conversion to the magnon current , as discussed in the previous section . to gain a quantitative understanding ,",
    "we carry out the following calculation .",
    "the @xmath138-components of spin and charge currents of the mm1 layer can be expressed as @xmath139 and @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the spin polarization of the conductivity , @xmath142 is the anomalous hall angle defined as the ratio of the hall conductivity to the longitudinal conductivity , @xmath143 is the charge accumulation and @xmath144 is the current density applied in the @xmath84-direction as before .",
    "we have assumed a spin - independent spin diffusion coefficient @xmath145 . since @xmath146",
    ", we may eliminate the charge accumulation term from eq .",
    "( 22 ) and get @xmath147 for the mil , eqs .  ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) remain valid , while for the mm2 layer , we similarly have @xmath148 by comparing eqs .",
    "( 24 ) and ( 25 ) with eqs .",
    "( 15 ) and ( 19 ) , one should realize that the induced electric current @xmath149 in the mm2 layer can be simply obtained by replacing @xmath145 by @xmath150 and @xmath85 by @xmath151 in eq .",
    "consequently , the electrical drag current is reduced by a fact of @xmath152 for the mm@xmath4mil@xmath4 mm trilayer if one approximates @xmath153 .",
    "this might be counter - intuitive at first glance , since one would expect the magnetic metals to provide more spin signals .",
    "however , if we realize the interplay between the charge and spin currents , one can readily explain the above conclusion : consider the extreme case of @xmath154 , i.e. , spin current generated by the anomalous hall is fully polarized such that the spin current is same as the charge current . since the charge current is completely blocked by the mil , it is inevitable that the spin current is also being completely blocked .      in this section , we consider a nm@xmath4mil bilayer . in this case",

    "firstly , in the former case , the electric drag is proportional to the square of the hall angle because the first metallic layer converts the electric current to the spin current via spin hall effect and the second metal layer converts the spin current into the electric current via inverse spin hall effect , while in the latter case , the spin current is directly injected from the thermally driven magnon current and thus the drag current is linearly proportional to the spin hall angle .",
