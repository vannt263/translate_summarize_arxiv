    "@xmath2due to their large masses , heavy flavor quarks are believed to be unique probes to the strongly coupled qcd matter created in high energy @xmath0 collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "they are mainly produced in the initial hard scatterings , so the production can be well studied by perturbative - qcd(pqcd )  @xcite .",
    "when heavy flavor quarks traverse the qcd medium , they are expected to lose less energy than light flavor quarks due to the dead - cone effect  @xcite , if the dominant energy loss process is gluon radiation .",
    "however , recent experimental studies found that the productions of non - photonic electrons ( npe ) from the semi - leptonic decays of charm and bottom hadrons are strongly suppressed at high @xmath3 in central @xmath0 collisions relative to that in @xmath4 collisions scaled by the number of binary collisions  @xcite and the npe - hadron azimuthal correlations possibly show a broadening on the away side  @xcite .",
    "these results suggest some significant contributions from other processes to heavy flavor quark energy loss , which have been simulating various theoretical reconsiderations .",
    "@xmath2 in order to differentiate model calculations , high precision measurements of npe production in both @xmath0 and @xmath4 collisions , with disentangled charm and bottom contributions , are wanted .",
    "in addition , model calculations with correct dynamics should be able to predict the elliptic flow of heavy flavor quarks at the same time .",
    "simultaneous measurements of npe production suppression and elliptic flow have better discriminating power on energy loss dynamics than individual measurement alone . the star collaboration has recently measured the npe production with high precision  @xcite and has separated charm and bottom contributions  @xcite , in @xmath4 collisions . in these proceedings , we report the progresses of studying npe production and elliptic flow in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "we also report preliminary results of npe - hadron correlation , which bear the information of the processes of heavy flavor quarks traversing the bulk qcd medium and thus shed light on heavy flavor jet - medium interactions .",
    "@xmath2the data sets used here are @xmath0 collisions at @xmath1gev collected by the star detector during rhic run 2010 . in these proceedings , we have utilized about 40 million minimum bias triggered events and about 60 million high - tower triggered events .",
    "the most important detectors used for npe analyses are the tpc ( time projection chamber )  @xcite and the barrel calorimeter system  @xcite including bemc ( barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ) and bsmd ( barrel shower maximum detector ) . in both data sets , electron identification procedures are applied , including , for example , analyzing the shower profiles in bsmd and the energy ( in bemc ) over momentum ( in tpc ) ratios .",
    "the calorimeter system largely enhances our ability to identify the electrons but currently constrains the electron kinematic to be @xmath5  gev / c and @xmath6 .",
    "the selected electron sample , inclusive electrons , is composed of mainly npes , photonic electrons and some hadron contamination .",
    "we reconstruct the 2d invariant masses of electron pairs to estimate the contribution of photonic electrons ( pe ) , the electrons from gamma conversions and @xmath7 , @xmath8 dalitz decays , with reconstruction efficiency @xmath9 obtained from simulation tracks embedded into real events , which spans @xmath10 depending on the cuts and the electron @xmath3 (  @xcite has more details on the analysis methods ) .",
    "then , statistically we have:@xmath11 where @xmath12 is the azimuthal correlation , but it also could be other npe variables , e.g. production or @xmath13 , and the hadron contribution is neglected if there are no more than 1% hadrons in the inclusive electron sample .",
    "@xmath2figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows npe production studies in @xmath14 central @xmath0 collisions based on minimum bias triggered events .",
    "the left panel demonstrates that the non - photonic electron over photonic electron ratio in run 2010 is around 1 , much higher than previous @xmath0 runs , providing a cleaner environment for npe studies .",
    "the right panel shows the npe spectrum with @xmath3 from 2  gev / c to about 6  gev / c . for higher @xmath3 , high - tower triggered events will provide larger statistics , ensuring high precision in extended @xmath3 range . in this preliminary result ,",
    "npe includes electrons from both open heavy flavor hadrons and heavy quarkonia . in our final results",
    ", we will subtract the latter .",
    "@xmath2 in figure  [ fig : v2 ] , the elliptic flow ( @xmath15 ) studies , also based on minimum bias triggered events , are shown .",
    "we extract @xmath15 by fitting electron angular correlations with the event plane ( ep )  @xcite . as an example , the @xmath16 distribution in @xmath17 central @xmath0 collisions for npe with @xmath18  gev / c is shown in the left panel . in this middle centrality , the npe @xmath15 is finite and consistent with our previous study based on run 2007  @xcite , indicating possible coupling between heavy flavor quarks and the qcd medium .",
    "further conclusions may be drawn only after the statistics error bars get reduced enough as we analyze more statistics .",
    "the current systematic uncertainties mainly come from the ep resolution uncertainty due to large centrality bin size and from photonic electron reconstruction efficiency .",
    "the differences between different @xmath15 methods are yet to be studied and included .",
    "the right panel shows npe @xmath15 in different centrality bins .",
    "@xmath2 in order to ensure that npe represent well the directions of the parent charm and bottom quarks , we use npe with @xmath19  gev / c from high - tower events to study the npe - hadron correlation .",
    "when we use associated tracks with @xmath20  gev / c , the tracks that can present the bulk medium the best , the statistical uncertainties are large . with @xmath21",
    "gev / c , we found there is a npe - hadron correlation beyond statistical uncertainties on both the near side and away side in @xmath17 central @xmath0 collisions , as shown in figure 3 in  @xcite .",
    "if this correlation is also beyond the systematic uncertainties , mainly due to flow modulations which are still under study , then it would indicate heavy flavor tagged jets do interact with the qcd medium .",
    "nevertheless , quantitative measurements yet to emerge and theoretical considerations , such as in  @xcite , are required to understand the physical picture .",
    "@xmath2 in summary , different measurements are sensitive to different aspects of the heavy flavor quark - medium interactions .",
    "the centrality dependence of these measurements will reflect properties of the qcd medium and together they provide strong constrains on dynamical models ."
