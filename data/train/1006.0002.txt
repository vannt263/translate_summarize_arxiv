    "flavor oscillations in dense neutrino gases exhibit collective phenomena caused by neutrino - neutrino interactions  @xcite . recently this topic has been studied intensely in the context of supernova neutrino oscillations ; for a recent review see ref .",
    "@xcite . in much of this literature",
    ", numerical tools were used to study cases of practical interest for supernova neutrinos .",
    "moreover , there has been progress in the analytic understanding of such intriguing phenomena as spectral splits , caused by the adiabatic decrease of the neutrino density with radius in a supernova .",
    "however , our theoretical understanding of many aspects of collective oscillations remains unsatisfactory .",
    "this applies , in particular , to the question of angular synchronization vs.  angular decoherence of neutrinos streaming from a supernova core  @xcite .",
    "with such general questions in mind , we here return to an elementary case of collective effects : synchronized oscillations in an isotropic neutrino gas with fixed density .",
    "modes with different energies , @xmath0 , and thus different vacuum oscillation frequencies , @xmath1 with @xmath2 the neutrino mass - squared difference , quickly de - phase ( kinematical decoherence ) .",
    "however , if the density is large one obtains synchronized oscillations : all modes `` stick together '' and oscillate with a common frequency @xmath3 @xcite . in the language of flavor - polarization vectors",
    "@xmath4 , all modes together form a common global @xmath5 that precesses as a single object .    while the extreme cases of very dilute and very dense gases are easy to understand , the question of what exactly happens for intermediate densities is less obvious .",
    "different possible answers come to mind .",
    "( i )  the system could decohere completely , but perhaps on a time scale that grows longer for larger neutrino densities .",
    "( ii )  a stationary state with some global @xmath6 of reduced length could be reached ( partial decoherence ) .",
    "the correct answer has elements of both ideas , in detail depending on the neutrino spectrum , density , and mixing angle . in the simplest case of maximal mixing , the system decoheres completely for densities below a certain threshold value . for larger densities ,",
    "synchronization is partial and becomes perfect in the limit of infinite density . the behavior of the system as a function of density thus shows a behavior similar to a phase transition .",
    "other forms of behavior arise for smaller mixing angles .",
    "the main reason is that polarization vectors that are initially aligned with each other and almost aligned with the effective magnetic field responsible for their precession can later deviate strongly from both directions due to parametric resonance effects . depending on whether or not the resonance frequency falls within the spectrum ,",
    "complete decoherence can arise , but can take a very long time to reach equilibrium .",
    "in other words , the decoherence time scale can be very different from any other time scale of the problem .",
    "our study is in many ways complementary to pantaleone s investigation of the _ stability of incoherence in an isotropic gas of oscillating neutrinos _  @xcite .",
    "he asked if a completely incoherent initial state would spontaneously develop global flavor polarization , a process resembling the spontaneous synchronization of a collection of coupled oscillators .",
    "he found neutral stability , implying that spontaneous synchronization does not occur , largely because the equations of motions conserve energy .",
    "this contrasts with some models designed to mimic spontaneous synchronization of certain biological systems  @xcite .",
    "returning to the polarization decay of an initially synchronized neutrino ensemble , we begin in sec .",
    "[ sec : eom ] by setting up the equations of motion of a system of interacting flavor polarization vectors . in sec .",
    "[ sec : decoherence ] we consider simple cases of kinematical decoherence . in sec .",
    "[ sec : asymptotic ] we derive analytic relations that allow us to calculate the asymptotic behavior . in sec .",
    "[ sec : maxmix ] we show that the threshold behavior of partial synchronization can be understood if one represents the spectrum in terms of two discrete polarization vectors . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theta ] we identify the phenomenon of self - induced resonant decoherence . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our findings .",
    "for the kinetic evolution of a particle ensemble , the fundamental entities are occupation numbers @xmath7 for every mode  @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 is a number operator and @xmath10 an expectation value or ensemble average . including the flavor degree of freedom ,",
    "the occupation numbers are replaced by flavor matrices of occupation numbers @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are flavor indices .",
    "the diagonal entries represent the occupation numbers for different flavors and are related to the survival probabilities , whereas the off - diagonal elements encode phase information  @xcite .",
    "based on this formalism , one can derive a boltzmann collision equation that allows one to study the evolution of a neutrino ensemble under the influence of both flavor oscillations and collisions  @xcite .    here",
    "we study a much simpler case where collisions are neglected , motivated by neutrinos streaming freely from a supernova core .",
    "however , in our schematic model we ignore all geometric effects and consider the time evolution of an isotropic ensemble rather than the spatial variation of a stationary flux . in the limit of ultrarelativistic neutrinos , the equations of motion ( eoms ) are  @xcite @xmath14\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 $ ] is a commutator and @xmath16 is the neutrino mass - squared matrix .",
    "it is not diagonal in the weak interaction basis , causing vacuum flavor oscillations .",
    "the global matrix @xmath17 has diagonal entries of neutrino number densities .",
    "this `` neutrino matter term '' has the same structure as the ordinary matter term where the role of the global @xmath18 is played by the matrix of electron , muon and tau - lepton number densities that is diagonal in the weak interaction basis .",
    "indeed , a background of neutrinos would be fully analogous to ordinary matter , were it not for the off - diagonal elements of @xmath18 as first recognized in pantaleone s seminal paper  @xcite .    full kinematical decoherence corresponds to the off - diagonal elements of @xmath18 vanishing in the mass basis . at a sufficient distance from a source",
    ", a neutrino flux will always end up in such a state .",
    "it is sometimes described as the wave packets of different mass eigenstates no longer overlapping .      for many studies it proves more transparent to represent @xmath19 in terms of polarization vectors @xmath20 in `` flavor space . ''",
    "we restrict our investigation to two flavors where @xmath19 is a hermitean @xmath21 matrix and thus can be expressed in terms of pauli matrices as @xmath22 ( while for three flavors , we need gell - mann matrices and 8-dimensional polarization vectors ) .",
    "likewise , we may write @xmath23 where @xmath1 is the vacuum oscillation frequency and @xmath24 a unit vector , playing the role of an effective magnetic field in the spin - precession formula below .    we study an isotropic ensemble , i.e.  we consider modes @xmath25 that represent all momentum modes of the same energy @xmath26 .",
    "it proves more convenient to label the modes with @xmath27 and corresponding polarization vectors @xmath4 .",
    "the eoms then appear in the familiar precession form ( fig .",
    "[ fig : precession ] ) @xmath28 the total polarization vector is @xmath29 which we normalize as @xmath30 . in this case",
    "@xmath31 , with @xmath32 the neutrino number density , is the interaction energy felt by a neutrino in the mean field of all others .",
    "the precession of individual modes is around @xmath24 which thus marks a natural symmetry direction of the problem .",
    "therefore , we choose the @xmath24direction as the @xmath33direction of a cartesian coordinate system in flavor space .",
    "we assume that all neutrinos are initially prepared in the same flavor , so all @xmath4 initially point in the weak - interaction direction .",
    "it is tilted relative to @xmath24 by twice the mixing angle @xmath34 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : precession ] ) .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath35 where @xmath36 is what we call the neutrino spectrum normalized to @xmath37 .",
    "the initial direction in the @xmath38@xmath39plane is arbitrary , owing to a global su(2 ) symmetry of the problem : the absolute phase of @xmath40 relative to another flavor @xmath41 is arbitrary .     with frequency @xmath42 around the @xmath33direction ( the mass direction in flavor space ) .",
    "the initial orientation is in the weak - interaction direction , tilted by twice the mixing angle relative to the @xmath33direction.[fig : precession ] ]    the eoms conserve the quantity @xmath43 which thus plays the role of total energy .",

    "the eoms can be derived from a classical hamiltonian .",
    "this is seen most easily if we use discrete polarization vectors @xmath45 for a set of @xmath46 frequency bins @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 the polarization vectors play the role of classical angular momenta with poisson brackets @xmath50=p_z$ ] and cyclic permutations.$ ] is a poisson bracket , not a commutator . of course , classical variables commute in the sense of @xmath51 . ]",
    "they inherit this property from the su(2 ) algebra of the `` flavor isospin matrices '' @xcite .",
    "the precession equations follow from the classical hamilton equations of motion @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath45 are classical variables because they arise from occupation number matrices which themselves are classical objects , not quantum operators , as they represent an expectation value .",
    "the quantity @xmath6 plays the role of the total angular momentum of the ensemble .",
    "naturally , its component along @xmath24 is conserved .",
    "the conservation of @xmath53 is also easily seen by taking the time derivative of this bilinear and inserting the eoms for @xmath44 .    in the polarization - vector language ,",
    "our ensemble of interacting neutrinos is equivalent to an ensemble of classical angular momenta @xmath45 that couple to an external magnetic field with strength @xmath47 and to each other with a dipole - dipole interaction of equal strength @xmath54 .",
    "however , they do not couple by some nearest - neighbor interaction , but rather every mode couples to every other with the same strength .",
    "occupation number matrices for antineutrinos can be defined in three different ways , all of which have been used in the literature . if @xmath55 and @xmath56 are creation and annihilation operators for antineutrinos in mode  @xmath8 we may define @xmath57 or @xmath58 or @xmath59 , the latter arising from normal ordering of @xmath60 .",
    "the third definition amounts to the flavor - isospin interpretation of polarization vectors  @xcite and is the most useful in our context .",
    "antiparticles are interpreted as negative - energy states and are thus described by . in the polarization - vector language , antineutrinos are then described by @xmath4 with negative @xmath42 .",
    "the flavor interpretation is now as follows : @xmath4 in the positive weak - interaction direction means @xmath40 , in the negative weak - interaction direction means @xmath41 if @xmath61 , whereas for @xmath62 these cases mean @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "this sounds complicated , but is simple in the hole interpretation of antiparticles where the presence of @xmath64 in mode @xmath8 is equivalent to the absence of a negative - energy @xmath40 from a filled mode in the dirac sea .",
    "once we are studying the dynamics of our abstract hamiltonian problem of interacting spins , the detailed flavor interpretation is irrelevant .",
    "we simply consider an ensemble of @xmath4 with a range of positive and negative @xmath42 .",
    "the dynamics of the system is the same if we go to a frame rotating with @xmath65 around the @xmath33direction  @xcite .",
    "this is seen most easily if we consider the spin - spin hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian1 ] ) and recall that @xmath66 is conserved .",
    "therefore , we may add a term @xmath67 , leading to @xmath68 therefore , even if we are having in mind an ensemble of neutrinos ( no antineutrinos ) and therefore a range of positive @xmath42 , we may shift the spectrum @xmath69 by a convenient amount @xmath70 and thus include negative @xmath42 .",
    "in other words , the negative-@xmath42 part of the spectrum can be interpreted as antineutrino modes or as neutrino modes after such a shift .",
    "the possibility of this general interpretation and the seamless connection of neutrino and antineutrino modes is the main advantage of the flavor - isospin interpretation of polarization vectors .",
    "we always consider non - negative spectra , @xmath71 , avoiding `` spectral crossings . ''",
    "the latter lead to unstable forms of motion ( `` flavor pendulum '' @xcite ) that are at the origin of spectral splits  @xcite . addressing the question of decoherence in such more general cases is beyond our present ambition .",
    "we will explicitly study two cases of simple spectra so that @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 . ]",
    "that are symmetric about @xmath75 and normalized to unity .",
    "one is a box spectrum where @xmath76 everywhere except @xmath77 the other example is a gaussian with unit variance @xmath78 we show these spectra in fig .  [",
    "fig : spectra ] .    ) and  ( [ eq : gaussianspectrum ] ) respectively.[fig : spectra ] ]    the box spectrum is representative for `` compact '' spectra that are non - zero in a finite @xmath42range , whereas the gaussian is representative for spectra with long tails .",
    "we will see that spectral tails are crucial for the phenomenon of resonant decoherence to be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : theta ] .",
    "when neutrino modes de - phase relative to each other , the system becomes in some sense disordered , but it is not trivial to define an objective measure for this effect .",
    "flavor oscillations alone ( no collisions ) do not increase the entropy of the system  @xcite .",
    "kinematical decoherence is reversible . for example",
    ", a neutrino flux decoheres kinematically after a short distance from the source , but a detector with sufficient energy resolution can still pick out oscillations in an energy - dependent way and in this sense restores coherence .",
    "another example is the phenomenon of spin echo : reversing the direction of the magnetic field unwinds the phases accrued by different modes and the original polarization re - appears .    in our case",
    "the simplest quantity to measure coherence is what pantaleone calls the `` order parameter ''  @xcite @xmath79 where it was assumed that @xmath80 . here",
    "@xmath81 is that part of @xmath6 transverse to @xmath24 .",
    "since @xmath82 is conserved , it is only the transverse component that can shrink by kinematical decoherence .",
    "dividing by @xmath83 normalizes the initial order parameter to @xmath84 .    were we to study decoherence for more complicated spectra , this definition would be less useful .",
    "when spectral crossings and pendular motions are involved , @xmath81 can grow even though the system becomes `` more disordered '' as it evolves .",
    "probably one would need to define kinematical decoherence in a differential sense , the dephasing of neighboring modes , leading to a shrinking of @xmath4 after coarse - graining over small but finite frequency bins @xmath85 . for our simple cases",
    "we are using a single frequency bin : the entire spectrum .",
    "de - phasing is easy to understand in the dilute limit where neutrino - neutrino interactions play no role ( @xmath86 ) and the evolution is determined by vacuum oscillations alone .",
    "the transverse components evolve as @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "in other words , the order parameter evolves as @xmath89 therefore , @xmath90 is given by the fourier transform of @xmath91 . unless @xmath91 includes `` spikes '' of the form @xmath92 at one or more frequencies @xmath47 , the late - time evolution is @xmath93 for @xmath94 ( complete kinematical decoherence ) .    for our two explicit examples ,",

    "for example , if @xmath69 consists of two separate box spectra , then for vanishing @xmath54 the spectrum completely decoheres and for infinite @xmath54 the system acts as one synchronized mode .",
    "however , one can choose @xmath54 so large that each individual box acts as one collective mode , being internally synchronized , yet so small that each box essentially precesses freely around @xmath24 .",
    "we now have effectively two weakly coupled modes and thus bimodal coherence .",
    "in the same way we can construct a hair - comb spectrum consisting of @xmath46 boxes , leading for intermediate @xmath54 to @xmath46-modal coherence .    a priori it is not obvious if a given spectrum , for a given interaction strength @xmath54 , will decohere or not , and in the latter case , how many modes are required to describe the asymptotic behavior .",
    "in the rest of the paper we study only cases of single - mode coherence where the final behavior is pure precession .",

    "non - maximal mixing enables a parametric resonance where those polarization vectors near the resonance frequency are driven away from their initial orientation .",
    "the back - reaction on the system consists of decoherence .",
    "this effect can only happen if the spectrum actually includes the resonance frequency , but this is always the case for spectra with long tails .",
    "the exact outcome depends on the spectrum and the mixing angle .",
    "decoherence can thus arise in different ways . in the dilute limit it consists of purely kinematical de - phasing of different modes . in the interacting system the effect is similar , except that each mode precesses around a different direction and this direction changes as the system decoheres .",
    "the self - induced resonant decoherence effect that we have discovered , on the other hand , is dynamical in the sense that an internal resonance of the system leads to an exponential decay of the global polarization vector .",
    "this decay can be slow , depending on parameters , and introduces a new time scale .",
    "our study is complementary to pantaleone  @xcite who used the completely incoherent state as an initial condition .",
    "based on an analytic argument , pantaleone found that such a system will never develop spontaneous polarization ( `` neutral stability '' ) .",
    "he also argued that a collective mode can be supported for any strength of @xmath54 , in seeming contrast to our finding of a minimum required @xmath54 to maintain partial coherence .",
    "however , this question depends on the assumed initial condition .",
    "beginning with all polarization vectors aligned with each other ( our case ) , indeed a minimum @xmath54 is required for a coherent motion to survive . on the other hand , one can set up a pure precession mode for any strength of @xmath54 where all polarization vectors are arranged in a co - rotating plane , not along a common direction @xcite . in practice",
    "this can be achieved by beginning with @xmath101 ( synchronized limit ) and then reduce @xmath54 adiabatically to any desired value .",
    "this procedure leads to a spectral split if @xmath54 is reduced all the way to zero , and to a pure precession mode for any non - vanishing @xmath54 .",
