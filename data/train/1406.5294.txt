    "<S> magnetization curves @xmath16 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.magnetism]a ) indicate a presence of magnetic order below 100 k. the difference between the field cooled ( fc ) and zero - field cooled ( zfc ) m(t ) curves indicates that we do not observe a typical paramagnet - ferromagnet transition . the nearly square - shaped hysteresis loops with rather high coercive fields ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.magnetism]b ) are a sign that the domain structure is present in the material . however , the lack of saturation of the @xmath17 curves at @xmath18  t ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.magnetism]c ) is a signature of a large frustration in our system and a formation of a mixed ferromagnet - spin - glass - like state.@xcite the arrot plots presented in figure [ fig.magnetism]d show that besides frustration ferromagnetic interactions occur below the magnetic transition temperature . the approximation of the maximum position in the @xmath19 curves was used to estimate the spin - glass - like transition temperature , @xmath20 , as about 97.5 k. this transition we assign to the ge - rich gepbmnte phase . </S>",
    "<S> below 5 k in the fc @xmath16 curves a signature of a magnetization coming from the pb - rich phase ( possibly paramagnetic ) is observed .     +    standard six - contact dc - current hall geometry with magnetic field @xmath21  </S>",
    "<S> t was used to determine the magnetotransport properties of our ge@xmath0pb@xmath1mn@xmath2te crystal . </S>",

    "<S> we note that the change of @xmath23 over the whole range of temperatures is relatively small , and the ratio of values obtained at the minimum and room temperature is close to 26 % . </S>",
    "<S> the low - temperature dependence of @xmath22 was fitted with the mott s law @xmath24 , \\label{math.mott}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the residual resistance and @xmath26 is a constant inversely proportional to the density of states at the fermi level.@xcite the result of fitting ( line ) is shown in figure [ fig.transport]a . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained a good agreement of our data with the mott s law , typical for variable - range hopping.@xcite    the @xmath27 dependence was measured from 300 k down to 4.5 k. the results were used to calculate of the temperature dependence of the hall carrier concentration @xmath28@xmath29@xmath30@xmath29@xmath31 ( where @xmath32 ) in the paramagnetic temperature region . as we can see in figure </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.transport]d the hall carrier concentration ( open symbols ) above @xmath20 is temperature independent . </S>",
    "<S> such situation is typical for degenerate semiconductors . in the spin - glass region </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous hall effect has a significant impact on the measured @xmath33 value and as a consequence we see an apparent decrease in the concentration ( see also ref . ) . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the ahe has to be taken into account for a proper estimation of the carrier concentration in the spin - glass - like state .    the magnetic field dependence of the hall resistivity @xmath27 ( see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig.transport]c ) indicates a presence of a strong anomalous hall effect at every measured temperature below the magnetic transition temperature , @xmath20 . in case of materials showing ahe behavior , </S>",
    "<S> the hall resistivity can be described in the following form : @xmath34 where @xmath33 is the normal hall constant , @xmath35 is vacuum permeability , and @xmath36 is the anomalous hall constant . </S>",
    "<S> the first term in eq.[math.ahe ] describes the normal hall effect caused by lorentz force , and the second the contribution of ahe due to the asymmetric carrier scattering . the magnetotransport data </S>",
    "<S> together with the previously measured magnetization at the same selected temperatures let us to calculate both of the hall constants . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained @xmath37  m@xmath7/c and @xmath6m@xmath7/c at liquid helium temperature . </S>",
    "<S> both constants are nearly temperature independent . </S>",
    "<S> obtained parameters are similar to those reported in our former study of gemnte - snmnte@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the @xmath33 values estimated from the ahe analysis we obtain a corrected carrier concentration at temperatures below magnetic transition . </S>",

    "<S> in the literature two major semiclassical mechanisms explaining the ahe are known - skew scattering and side jump . for the skew scattering@xcite the @xmath41 , </S>",
    "<S> while for the side jump@xcite the @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed analysis of ahe includes a scaling relationship described by the following equation : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are scaling parameters , which give us information about a dominant scattering mechanism leading to ahe in the sample . for liquid helium temperature we obtained @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath45 is nearly temperature independent . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated value indicates that the extrinsic skew scattering is a dominant mechanism responsible for ahe in studied ge@xmath0pb@xmath1mn@xmath2te crystal . </S>",
    "<S> the main role of this mechanism was also pointed out for bulk ge@xmath38sn@xmath39mn@xmath40te crystals.@xcite    low - field @xmath47 curves show hysteresis loops of ahe . as presented in figure [ fig.transport]b , the hysteresis loops are observed up to the critical temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of hysteresis indicates a large frustration in our spin - glass - like system . in figure </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.transport]e we gathered the values of the coercivity field , @xmath48 , estimated from ahe loops ( squares ) and from magnetization curves ( circles ) as a function of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> as we can see both quantities are in good agreement and fall down to zero at the transition temperature , @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates a presence of asymmetric carrier scattering in our spin - glass - like system , directly correlated with magnetic properties of the alloy .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnetoresistance was measured together with the hall effect . at low - temperatures a negative magnetoresistance with a minimum at about 0.5 t was observed . </S>",
    "<S> contribution of the negative magnetoresistance to the total magnetoresistance decreases with increase of temperature . at high temperatures ( t @xmath49 @xmath20 ) </S>",
    "<S> only the positive magnetoresistance proportional to @xmath50 was observed . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath47 changes from -0.78 up to 1.18 % of @xmath51 with growing temperature , till @xmath20 is reached . above the magnetic transition temperature </S>",
    "<S> the trend is opposite , the values of magnetoresistance become lower </S>",
    "<S> . the observed negative magnetoresistance may be due to the weak localization .    to conclude , we have shown results of magnetotransport measurements for a bulk spin - glass - like ge@xmath0pb@xmath1mn@xmath2te crystal .    </S>",
    "<S> temperature - dependent resistivity indicates a metalic - like trend , but a minimum below 30 k is observed . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of @xmath22 pointed to the variable - range hopping . </S>",
    "<S> the crystal is a @xmath28-type semiconductor with high hall carrier concentration @xmath4  @xmath5 .    the anomalous hall effect with wide hysteresis loops was observed . </S>",
    "<S> calculated ahe coefficient , @xmath36 , is temperature independent , with the value close to @xmath52  m@xmath7/c . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed analysis of the effect indicates that the main physical mechanism responsible for ahe in ge@xmath0pb@xmath1mn@xmath2te alloy is the extrinsic skew scattering mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> magnetotransport properties of the bulk ge@xmath0pb@xmath1mn@xmath2te crystal are strongly correlated with the spin - glass - like nature of the alloy . </S>"
