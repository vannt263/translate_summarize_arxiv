    "it is well known that the cpss with integrated computational and physical processes can be regarded as a new generation of control systems and can interact with humans through many new modalities @xcite .",
    "the objective of cps is to develop new science and engineering methods in which cyber and physical designs are compatible , synergistic , and integrated at all scales .",
    "besides , as we all know , the dpss can be used to well characterize those cyber - physical process @xcite and the actions and measurements of the system studied are better described by utilizing the actuators and sensors , which was first introduced by el jai and pritchard in @xcite and mainly focused on the locations , number and spatial distributions of the actuators and sensors .",
    "moreover , in the past several decades , fractional calculus has shown great potential in science and engineering applications and some phenomena such as self - similarity , non - stationary , non - gaussian process and short or long memory process are all closely related to fractional calculus @xcite .",
    "it is now widely believed that , using fractional calculus in modeling can better capture the complex dynamics of natural and man - made systems , and fractional order controls can offer better performance not achievable before using integer order controls @xcite .",
    "motivated by the above arguments , in this paper , let @xmath0 be an open bounded subset of @xmath1 with smooth boundary @xmath2 and we consider the following fractional dpss : @xmath3,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is a given constant , @xmath5 is the control input depending on the number and the structure of actuators and @xmath6 may be a fractional laplacian operator , a fractional power of operator or a fractional derivative .",
    "the contribution of this present paper is to analyze the relationship among the fractional laplacian operator , fractional power of operator and fractional derivative and try to explore the opportunities and research challenges related to the fractional order dpss emerging at the same time . to the best of our knowledge , no result is available on this topic .",

    "now we have the following result .",
    "@xcite suppose that @xmath7 is defined in @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",

    "let @xmath33 be the inner product of @xmath24 we define the fractional power of operator @xmath6 as follows : @xmath34 then @xmath35 are the eigenvalues of @xmath36 .",
    "this implies that the two operators are different .",
    "moreover , the work spaces of the two operators ( fractional laplacian operator and fractional power of operator @xmath6 ) are different . before stating our main results , we first introduce two banach spaces , which are specified in @xcite .    for @xmath37 is a bounded domain , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , we define the classical sobolev space @xmath40 as follows @xcite : @xmath41 endowed with the natural norm @xmath42 is an intermediary banach space between @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",

    "more precisely , for any element @xmath62 , since @xmath63 is a local operator and we do not know how @xmath64 approaches @xmath19 when @xmath65 . even if considering the space @xmath66 , we only know",
    "that the function @xmath67 on the boundary and we do not know how @xmath51 approaches 0 . however , for the fractional laplacian operator , it is a nonlocal operator and it is defined in the whole space .",

    "it coincides with the result of the theorem 1.2 in @xcite .",

    "recent advances in modeling and control of fractional diffusion systems , fractional reaction - diffusion systems and fractional reaction - diffusion - advection systems have been reviewed in the framework of cpss .",
    "the fractional order dpss have now been found wide applications for describing many physical phenomena , such as sub - diffusion or super - diffusion processes . at the same time , to our best knowledge , many problems are still open calling for research cooperation of multi - disciplines such as mathematical modelling , engineering applications , and information sciences .",

    "another interesting and important topic concerns the time - space fractional dpss where the traditional first order derivative is replaced by a fractional order derivative with respect to the time @xmath137 .",
    "furthermore , in the case of diffusion systems , it is worth mentioning that , in general , not all the states can be reached in the whole domain of interest @xcite and it would be more challenging in nature since the dynamics of the real - life control problem is always hybrid continuous and discrete . due to the spatial - temporal sampling and discrete nature of decision and control ,",
    "the notions of regional analysis should be introduced , i.e. , we can consider the regional stability , regional controllability , regional observability etc .",
    "of the system under consideration .",
    "in addition , as stated in @xcite , from an application point of view , some plain questions such as  how many actuators / sensors are sufficient and how to best configure them for a fractional dpss control process ? \" ,  given the desirable zone shape , is it possible to control or contain the fractional diffusion process within the given zone ? \" , if not ,  how to quantify the controllability / observability of the actuators / sensors \" and etc . might be asked , which in fact raises some important theoretical challenges and open new opportunities for further research .",
    "this paper is concerned with the fractional order dpss with three different operators : fractional laplacian operator , fractional power of operator and fractional derivative .",
    "the relationship among the three operators and the emerging research opportunities are introduced .",
    "we hope that the results here could provided some insight into the control theory analysis of fractional order dpss in particular and cpss in general .",
