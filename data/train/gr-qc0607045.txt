    "the calculation of photon interactions with matter is a staple in an introductory ( or advanced ) quantum mechanics course .",
    "indeed the evaluation of the compton scattering cross section is a standard exercise in relativistic quantum mechanics , since gauge invariance together with the masslessness of the photon allow the results to be presented in terms of simple analytic forms@xcite .    on the surface",
    ", a similar analysis should be applicable to the interactions of gravitons .",
    "indeed , like photons , such particles are massless and subject to a gauge invariance , so that similar analytic results for graviton cross sections can be expected .",
    "also , just as virtual photon exchange leads to a detailed understanding of electromagnetic interactions between charged systems , a careful treatment of virtual graviton exchange allows an understanding not just of newtonian gravity , but also of spin - dependent phenomena associated with general relativity which are to be tested in the recently launched gravity probe b@xcite .",
    "however , despite this obvious parallel , examination of quantum mechanics texts reveals that ( with one exception@xcite ) the case of graviton interactions is not discussed in any detail .",
    "there are at least three reasons for this situation :    * the graviton is a spin - two particle , as opposed to the spin - one photon , so that the interaction forms are somewhat more complex , involving symmetric and traceless second rank tensors rather than simple lorentz four - vectors ; * there exist few experimental results with which to compare the theoretical calculations ; * as we will see later in some processes , in order to guarantee gauge invariance one must include , in addition to the usual born and seagull diagrams , the contribution from a graviton pole term , involving a triple - graviton coupling .",
    "this vertex is a sixth rank tensor and contains a multitude of kinematic forms .",
    "however , recently , using powerful ( string - based ) techniques , which simplify conventional quantum field theory calculations , it has recently been demonstrated that the elastic scattering of gravitons from an elementary target of arbitrary spin must factorize@xcite , a feature that had been noted ten years previously by choi et al . based on gauge theory arguments@xcite . this factorization permits a relatively painless evaluation of the various graviton amplitudes .",
    "below we show how this factorization comes about and we evaluate some relevant cross sections .",
    "such calculations can be used as an interesting auxiliary topic within an advanced quantum mechanics course    in the next section we review the simple electromagnetic case and develop the corresponding gravitational formalism . in section 3 we give the factorization results and calculate the relevant cross sections , and our results are summarized in a concluding section 4 .",
    "two appendices contain some of the formalism and calculational details .",
    "before treating the case of gravitons it is useful to review the case of photon interactions , since this familiar formalism can be used as a bridge to our understanding of the gravitational case .",
    "we begin by generating the photon interaction lagrangian , which is accomplished by writing down the free matter lagrangian together with the minimal substitution@xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the particle charge and @xmath2 is the photon field . as examples , we discuss below the case of a scalar field and a spin 1/2 field , since these are familiar to most readers .",
    "thus , for example , the lagrangian for a free charged klein - gordon field is known to be @xmath3 which becomes @xmath4 after the minimal substitution .",
    "the corresponding interaction lagrangian can then be identified @xmath5 similarly , for spin 1/2 , the free dirac lagrangian @xmath6 becomes @xmath7 whereby the interaction lagrangian is found to be @xmath8 the single - photon vertices are then @xmath9 for spin zero and @xmath10 for spin 1/2and the amplitudes for photon ( compton ) scattering_cf_. figure 1can be calculated . in the case of spin zero ,",

    "the results are usually presented in the laboratory frame@xmath16wherein the incident and final photon energies are related by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the scattering angle . for unpolarized scattering ,",
    "we sum ( average ) over final ( initial ) spins via @xmath19 and the resulting cross sections are well known @xmath20 and @xmath21\\nonumber\\\\ & = & { \\alpha^2\\over m^2}{\\omega_f^2\\over \\omega_i^2}[{1\\over 2 } ( 1+\\cos^2\\theta)(1 + 2{\\omega_i\\over m}\\sin^2{1\\over",

    "helicity is defined by the projection of the particle spin along its momentum direction . in the case of a photon moving along the z - direction",
    ", we choose states @xmath22 while for a photon moving in the direction @xmath23 we use states @xmath24 working in the center of mass frame we can then calculate the amplitude for transitions between states of definite helicity . using @xmath25 @xmath26",
    "we find for spin zero compton scattering @xmath27 while these results can be found by direct calculation , the process can be simplified by realizing that under a parity transformation the momentum reverses but the spin stays the same .",
    "thus the helicity reverses , so parity conservation assures the equality of @xmath28 and @xmath29 while under time reversal both spin and momentum change sign , as do initial and final states , guaranteeing that helicity amplitudes are symmetric@xmath30 .    using the standard definitions @xmath31 it is easy to see from simple kinematical considerations that @xmath32 we can write then@xcite @xmath33 ( it is interesting that the general form of these amplitudes follows from simple kinematical constraints , as shown in ref .",

    "so far , all we have done is to derive the usual forms for compton cross sections by non - traditional means .",
    "however , in the next section we shall see how the use of helicity methods allows the derivation of the corresponding graviton cross sections in an equally straightforward fashion .",
    "the theory of graviton interactions can be developed in direct analogy to that of electromagnetism .",
    "some of the details are given in appendix a. here we shall be content with a brief outline .",
    "just as the electromagnetic interaction can be written in terms of the coupling of a vector current @xmath53 to the vector potential @xmath54 with a coupling constant given by the charge @xmath1 @xmath55 the gravitational interaction can be described in terms of the coupling of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath56 to the gravitational field @xmath57 with a coupling constant @xmath58 @xmath59 here the field tensor is defined in terms of the metric via @xmath60 while @xmath58 is defined in terms of newton s constant via @xmath61 .",

    "the existence of a seagull is required by the feature that the energy - momentum tensor is momentum - dependent and therefore yields a contact interactions when the minimal substitution is made , yielding the amplitudes @xmath77 for the photon pole diagram we require a new ingredient , the graviton - photon coupling , which can be found from the expression for the photon energy - momentum tensor@xcite @xmath78 this yields the photon pole term @xmath79\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    adding the four diagrams together , we find ( after considerable but simple algebra_cf . _",
    "appendix b ) a remarkably simple result @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the factor @xmath82 and @xmath83 is the compton scattering amplitude for particles of spin s calculated in the previous section .",
    "the gauge invariance of eq .",
    "[ eq : gi ] is obvious , since it follows directly from the gauge invariance already shown for the corresponding photon amplitudes together with that of the factor @xmath81 under @xmath84 also we note that in eq .",
    "[ eq : gi ] the factorization condition mentioned in the introduction is made manifest , and consequently the corresponding cross sections can be obtained trivially . in principle , one can use conventional techniques , but this is somewhat challenging in view of the tensor structure of the graviton polarization vector .",
    "however , factorization means that helicity amplitudes for graviton photoproduction are simple products of the corresponding photon amplitudes times the universal factor @xmath81 , and the cross sections are then given by the simple photon forms times the universal factor @xmath85 . in the cm frame",
    "we have @xmath86 and the factor @xmath81 assumes the form @xmath87^{1\\over 2}\\ ] ] in the lab frame this takes the form @xmath88 and the graviton photoproduction cross sections are found to be @xmath89 & s=0\\\\ ( { \\omega_f\\over \\omega_i})^3[({\\rm ctn}^2{1\\over 2}\\theta\\cos^2{1\\over 2}\\theta+\\sin^2{1\\over 2}\\theta)+{2\\omega_i\\over m}(\\cos^4{1\\over 2}\\theta+\\sin^4{1\\over 2 } \\theta)+2{\\omega_i^2\\over m^2}\\sin^2{1\\over 2}\\theta]&s=1/2 \\end{array}\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ \\qquad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the form of the latter has previously been given by voronov.@xcite      finally , we can proceed to our primary goal , which is the calculation of graviton compton scattering .",
    "in order to produce a gauge invariant scattering amplitude in this case we require _ four _ separate contributions , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "two of these diagrams are born terms and can be written down straightforwardly .",
    "however , there are also seagull terms both for spin 0 and for spin 1/2 , whose forms can be found in appendix a. for the scalar case we have @xmath90\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while in the case of spin 1/2 @xmath91u(p_i)\\nonumber\\\\ \\quad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    despite the complex form of the various contributions , the final form , which results ( after considerable algebra-_cf_. appendix b ) upon summation of the various components , is remarkably simple : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the universal factor @xmath94 and the compton amplitudes are those calculated in section 2 .",
    "the gauge invariance of this form is again obvious from the already - demonstrated gauge invariance of the photon amplitudes and this is the factorized form guaranteed by general arguments@xcite .",
    "again , it is in principle possible but very challenging to evaluate the cross section by standard means , but the result follows directly by the use of helicity methods . from the form of eq .",
    "[ eq : fac ] it is clear that the helicity amplitudes for graviton scattering have the simple form of a product of corresponding helicity amplitudes for spinless and spin s compton scattering",

    "the latter form agrees with that given by voronov@xcite .",
    "we have given the results for unpolarized scattering from an unpolarized target , but having the form of the helicity amplitudes means that we can also produce cross sections involving polarized photons or gravitons .",
    "that is , however , a subject for a different time and a different paper .",
    "while the subject of photon interactions with charged particles is a standard one in any quantum mechanics course , the same is not true for that of graviton interactions with masses despite the obvious parallels between these two topics .",
    "the origin of this disparity lies with the complications associated with the tensor structure of gravity and the inherent nonlinearity of gravitational theory .",
    "we have argued above that this need not be the case . indeed in an earlier work we showed how the parallel between the exchange of _ virtual _ gravitons and photons could be used in order to understand the phenomena of geodetic and lense - thirring precession in terms of the the related spin - orbit and spin - spin interactions in quantum electrodynamics@xcite . in the present paper , we have shown how the treatment of graviton scattering processes can benefit from use of this analogy .",
    "of course , such amplitudes are inherently more complex , in that they must involve tensor polarization vectors and the addition of somewhat complex photon or graviton pole diagrams .",
    "however , it is remarkable that when all effects are added together , the resulting amplitudes factorize into simple products of photon amplitudes times kinematic factors . using helicity methods , this factorization property then allows the relatively elementary calculation of cross sections since they involve simple products of the already known photon amplitudes times kinematical factors .",
    "it is hoped that this remarkable result will allow introduction of graviton reactions into the quantum mechanics cirriculum in at least perhaps a special topics presentation . in any case , the simplicity associated with this result means that graviton interactions can be considered a topic which is no longer only associated with advanced research papers .      here",
    "we present some of the basics of gravitational field theory .",
