    "one of the most promising avenues for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) is supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite , since it can provide a fundamental understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and it allows unification of the electroweak and strong interactions at a grand unified scale @xcite .",
    "because of its great theoretical attraction , extensive phenomenological work continues to explore the ways for discovery and precision study of supersymmetric particles at present and future colliders .",
    "most of these investigations are directed to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which has the minimal new particle content @xcite .",
    "the mssm contains two higgs doublets which develop vacuum expectation values @xmath10 and @xmath11 that break the @xmath12 gauge symmetry spontaneously @xcite .",
    "there are 5 physical higgs bosons in the mssm : two cp - even states @xmath13 and @xmath1 , a cp - odd state @xmath2 , and two charged states @xmath14 ; the lightest higgs boson is @xmath13 .",
    "the ratio @xmath15 is a critical parameter of the mssm : it characterizes the relative fraction that the two higgs doublets contribute to the ewsb , and it enters all sectors of the theory .",
    "the interactions of both the susy particles and the higgs bosons depend on @xmath3 , and the relations of susy particle masses to the soft symmetry breaking parameters of supersymmetry involve @xmath3@xcite .",
    "a measurement of @xmath3 from one sector will thereby allow predictions or tests in other sectors .",
    "the renormalization group evolution of the yukawa couplings from the unification scale to the electroweak scale are sensitive to the value of @xmath3 .",
    "the large top quark mass can naturally be explained with @xmath16 unification as a quasi - infrared fixed point of the top yukawa coupling if @xmath17 or @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the possibility of so(10 ) yukawa unification requires the high @xmath3 solution @xcite .",
    "the predicted mass of the lightest susy higgs boson also depends on @xmath3 , with @xmath19gev at @xmath17 and @xmath20  gev at @xmath21 @xcite .    because of the significance of @xmath3 for the theory and phenomenology of the mssm , it is important to find processes in which @xmath3 can be best determined .",
    "some regions of the mssm parameter space have been excluded at lep2 @xcite due to the lower bound on the lightest higgs boson mass ( @xmath22 ) , particularly at low @xmath3 near 1 .",
    "much of the parameter space remains to be explored at the upgraded tevatron @xcite , the lhc @xcite , the future linear colliders @xcite and muon colliders @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 constraints that may be obtained from @xmath22 via radiative corrections @xcite , or from precision electroweak measurements @xcite , or from susy particle production usually depend also on other susy parameters .",
    "furthermore , measurements of @xmath23 or @xmath24 via other susy processes without directly involving higgs bosons do not accurately determine large @xmath3 values @xcite .",
    "for general susy higgs phenomenology , we refer the readers to reviews @xcite .",
    "the higgs couplings of @xmath25 to heavy quarks are given by @xmath26 , \\label{equ : htb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the decoupling limit @xmath27 has been assumed for the approximate forms of @xmath28 . in this limit",
    ", the lightest higgs boson @xmath13 becomes sm - like and its couplings are insensitive to susy parameters . for the @xmath25 higgs bosons ,",
    "@xmath3 is essentially the unique parameter for higgs - heavy quark couplings .",
    "this suggests that studies of the associated production of the higgs bosons and heavy quarks may effectively probe the @xmath3 parameter .",
    "heavy higgs boson production at future @xmath0 colliders was discussed in ref .  @xcite . in a recent study feng and moroi@xcite evaluated the prospects for determining @xmath3 in @xmath0 collisions with @xmath29 and 1  tev c.m .",
    "energy via the processes @xmath30 the primary channel in their study involves the @xmath31 coupling .",
    "they found that the strong dependence of heavy higgs branching fractions on @xmath3 allows stringent constraints to be placed for moderate @xmath3@xcite in the mssm . in the present paper ,",
    "we report results of a complementary study of the associated production of a neutral higgs boson and heavy quarks @xmath32 these processes involve @xmath33 and @xmath34 production separately and are thereby expected to be complementary for low and high values of @xmath3 .",
    "we study the sensitivity to probe @xmath3 in two scenarios : the minimal supergravity model ( msugra ) and the mssm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we present the higgs decay branching fractions and the cross sections for the associated production of the higgs bosons and heavy quarks in sec .",
    "we analyze the sensitivity to determine the value of @xmath3 at future linear colliders in sec .",
    "we discuss our results , make some general remarks and conclude in sec .",
    "the mass matrix of the cp - even higgs bosons of the mssm is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 represents the radiative corrections . at tree level ,",
    "the input parameters are @xmath37 and @xmath3 , and the phenomenology is relatively easy to analyze",
    ". the radiative corrections may be substantial in this cp - even sector and they are dependent on other susy parameters , especially on the masses and couplings / mixings of the top quark and heavy scalar quarks ( squarks ) @xcite . in a general mssm analysis",
    "the parameters required as input are @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the soft susy breaking mass parameter of left - handed stop ( where only the heavy third generation parameters are relevant ) , @xmath40 the susy breaking mass parameter of right - handed stop ( sbottom ) , @xmath41 the gaugino masses , @xmath42 the stop trilinear soft breaking term , and @xmath43 the higgs mixing parameter .",
    "the large parameter space involved makes phenomenological studies difficult . on the other hand ,",
    "once a precision measurement is made in the higgs sector in future collider experiments , we would expect to learn more about the susy sector due to the radiative relations among the physical susy masses . instead of exploring the large space of the mssm soft parameters , we focus on the following two scenarios for illustration .",
    "* *    motivated by the msugra model and the requirements of radiatively generated electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , we relate the soft susy breaking parameters to the common scalar , fermion and trilinear parameters @xmath44 at the grand unified scale . for specific choices of @xmath3",
    "the results depend on the sign of @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath45 sign is less constrained by @xmath46 decay @xcite and we adopt this convention in our analysis .    we make use of the isajet package @xcite to determine the susy masses and couplings from the gut scale input parameters .",
    "the higgs mass eigenvalues are among the outputs of this program .",
    "these values agree with the corresponding results from the code of ref .",
    "@xcite to a precision @xmath47 .",
    "the soft - supersymmetry - breaking parameters are evolved according to renormalization group ( rg ) equations @xcite . for our illustrations",
    "we make the parameter choice @xmath48 along with the positive sign of @xmath43 . the magnitude of @xmath43 is fixed in terms of @xmath49 through the radiately generated ewsb . for three representative @xmath3 values ,",
    "the mass eigenvalues of higgs bosons and susy soft - breaking terms are listed in table  [ para ] . for charginos and neutralinos",
    ", we list only the masses of the lightest ones .",
    "in fact , our choice of the above parameters is somewhat conservative in exploring the susy higgs sector . a large @xmath50 results in heavy @xmath51 .",
    "consequently it leads to the `` decoupling limit '' @xcite so that the lightest higgs boson @xmath13 becomes sm - like and thus insensitive to the susy parameters .",
    ".isajet output parameters based on the msugra input in eq .",
    "( [ msugra ] ) . [ para ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     0.2 cm    -1 cm",
    "for the msugra scenario , @xmath3 is essentially the only variable after fixing the other soft susy breaking parameters as in eq .",
    "( [ msugra ] ) .",
    "the masses of the @xmath52 higgs bosons decrease as @xmath3 increases .",
    "thus the corresponding higgs branching fractions and the production cross sections at a given energy increase with @xmath3 , especially for large values .",
    "this leads to possible accurate determinations of @xmath3 in msugra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : const ] ) , for high values in particular .",
    "in contrast , for the mssm scenario the masses of @xmath2 and @xmath1 are independent of @xmath3 , and are kept fixed in the analyses . at large @xmath3 values the decay branching fractions and the production cross sections of @xmath2 or @xmath1 with @xmath53 reach a plateau in the mssm . consequently the determination of @xmath3 in that range is less effective .",
    "there are other processes by which @xmath3 may also be constrained : ( i ) chargino pair production in @xmath0 collisions can provide good measurements on @xmath3 for low @xmath3 values @xcite ; ( ii ) @xmath54 mixing can be a sensitive probe of @xmath3 @xcite ; ( iii ) gaugino production in @xmath55 collisions may provide information on @xmath3 @xcite ; ( iv ) kinematical distributions from the decay products of susy particles can be used to determine the @xmath3 value @xcite ; ( v ) the magnetic dipole moment of the muon may be useful for @xmath56 if slepton masses @xmath57 gev @xcite ;",
    "( vi ) the branching fractions of @xmath58 may be useful to set a lower bound @xmath5 @xcite . the alternative methods in ( i)-(iv ) probe either @xmath23 or @xmath24 ;",
    "thus the sensitivity to @xmath3 is degraded at high values of @xmath3 . on the other hand , methods ( v ) and ( vi )",
    "are only effective for high values of @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast , higgs boson production processes under consideration and the @xmath59 process discussed in ref.@xcite are direct probes of @xmath3 with the complementary constraints from @xmath60 and @xmath61 final states at low and high values of @xmath3 , respectively .    in summary",
    ", we studied heavy neutral higgs boson production in the minimal supersymmetric theories at a linear collider with @xmath4 tev with the expected integrated luminosities of @xmath62 .",
    "the cross sections have a strong dependence on the fundamental supersymmetry parameter @xmath3 , and thus provide a good way to determine it .",
    "we considered the @xmath7 and @xmath8 final states which are sensitive and complementary in determining @xmath3 . in the supergravity scenario ,",
    "the sensitivity is particularly good for @xmath5 in comparison with other methods , reaching a @xmath6 or better determination in a @xmath63 c.l .",
    "cross section measurement . in the general mssm scenario ,",
    "the interplay between the @xmath7 and @xmath8 channels results in a good determination for @xmath9 ( see table  [ result ] ) . for higher values of @xmath3",
    "the sensitivity is weakened .",
    "the accuracy of @xmath3 determination is generally sufficient to distinguish theories with a low value ( @xmath64 ) from a high value @xmath65 and thus to provide information on testing certain guts scenarios",
