    "electronic transport in semiconducting nanostructures is studied both as it has great potential applications in spintronics , @xcite and because of its exquisite control of parameters , which allow insightful probes into fundamental physical phenomena .",
    "electrons in such systems experience externally controlled confining environments that result in strong coulomb interactions with other electrons . as such , quantum dot ( qd ) structures provide well - characterized and defined systems for studying quantum many - body physics .",
    "qds may also allow the realization of solid state quantum computation devices as well as spintronic semiconductor devices with unprecedented functionalities .",
    "@xcite    manipulation of spin - polarized current sources is crucial in spintronics .",
    "this typically requires efficient spin injection into conventional semiconductors .",
    "the difficulties with spin injection from ferromagnetic metal leads has stimulated extensive efforts to produce spin polarized currents out of unpolarized sources .",
    "@xcite in this context , the rashba spin - orbit ( rso ) coupling mechanism provides a basis for possible device applications .",

    "@xcite    in this paper we study the electronic transport through a quantum dot connected to polarizing quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) in both the coulomb blockade ( cb ) and kondo regimes .",
    "due to strong spin - orbit interactions , @xcite qpcs can exhibit spin - dependent hybridization of the qd states with the leads , _ without _ applied magnetic fields , opening the possibility for generating spin - polarized transport in an all - electrical setup .",
    "these effects are controllable by lateral gate voltages applied on qpcs , resulting in spatially asymmetric structures , as in recent experiments.@xcite using the equation - of - motion technique and numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) calculations we obtain the electronic green s function , conductance and spin polarization in different system regimes .",
    "our results show that both the cb and kondo regimes exhibit non - zero spin - polarized conductance in this system .",
    "we analyze how the spin - dependent hybridization of the qpc modifies the charge accumulation in the dot , as well as the density of states ( spectral functions ) of the system .",
    "interestingly , we find that the polarizing qpcs produce spin polarization and split dos in the kondo regime akin to that reported for current injection from ferromagnetic leads , @xcite although here it occurs for unpolarized reservoirs .",
    "our theoretical studies suggest that these effects could be accessible in experiments and result in future spintronic devices .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we present the main features of the current polarization in quantum point contact systems with lateral spin - orbit , obtained by scattering matrix methods in section [ qpcs ] .",

    "notice that this potential form is asymmetric in the @xmath2 direction , to reflect an essential ingredient in the experiments : the qpc potential must lack @xmath2-reflection symmetry in order to generate the polarizing effect along the @xmath0-direction .",
    "@xcite in fact , the fields forming @xmath20 generate a spin - orbit coupling given by @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is material - specific .",
    "notice that @xmath23 lies in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane , so that the barrier fields induce a _",
    "lateral _ spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the qpc will then be given by , @xmath24    , obtained from a scattering matrix approach.@xcite the interplay of vertical and lateral so effects may result in large asymmetry for the up and down spin components for realistic structure parameters , even in the tunneling regime shown here ( @xmath25 ) . ]    using a scattering - matrix formalism to study the spin - dependent electron transport in this qpc , @xcite we find that a net spin - polarized conductance is produced only for @xmath2-asymmetric potentials .",

    "we see that conductances @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be very different from each other , even in the tunneling regime ( where each @xmath25 ) in which the qpc would operate to create a quantum dot in the 2deg . we stress that for these realistic values of structure parameters , one obtains non - zero spin polarization even when there is _ no external magnetic field _ and the injection is _",
    "unpolarized_. this interesting result can be understood from anticrossing features in the subband energy structure in the channel region defining the qpc .",
    "@xcite the spin mixings and avoided crossings generate spin rotation as electrons pass through the narrow constriction of the qpc , and can generate large values of the ratio @xmath38 , even in the tunneling regime .",
    "two of these qpcs can then be used to define the qd and result in interesting charging and conductance regimes , as we will see below .",
    "in order to address the transport through a quantum dot formed with polarizing qpcs , we consider the single impurity anderson model given by the following hamiltonian : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron of spin @xmath41 in the dot .",
