    "boyer and zhang  @xcite extended this work by arguing that if @xmath7 is not a boundary slope and @xmath9 is finite , then , again , @xmath7 must have small norm . taking advantage of this observation , we  @xcite proved that the @xmath10 pretzel knot admits only four finite surgeries and that its @xmath0-character variety consists of two algebraic curves . in the current article",
    "we generalize these results to hyperbolic pretzel knots of the form @xmath1 .    in particular , we argue that the only examples of non - trivial cyclic or finite surgeries on such a knot are the five surgeries on the @xmath10 and @xmath11 pretzels found by fintushel and stern  @xcite and bleiler and hodgson  @xcite .",

    "the essential new ingredient is the use of the seifert fibred surgeries of the @xmath1 pretzel knots .",
    "although the culler - shalen norm of a slope @xmath7 may be very large when @xmath8 is a seifert fibred space , it is nonetheless possible to bound that norm in terms of the seifert indices of @xmath8 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , the seifert structure of the @xmath14-fold branched cyclic cover of a pretzel knot also constrains the norm .",
    "combining these constraints with knowledge of the boundary slopes ( @xcite ) allows us to explicitly work out the culler - shalen norms of the hyperbolic @xmath1 pretzel knots . given these norms ,",
    "we classify the finite and cyclic dehn surgeries , enumerate the curves in the @xmath0-character variety , and construct the fundamental polygon and newton polygon of the @xmath15-polynomial for these knots .",

    "since the set of reducible characters forms a complex line , we see that @xmath683 , the character variety of the knot @xmath16 , consists of two ( three ) curves when @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath115 or @xmath524 . to complete the proof of the main theorem for these @xmath17",
    ", we need only verify that the culler - shalen seminorms are as stated .    if @xmath115 we know the norm on the norm curve @xmath107 up to the coefficient @xmath548 .",
    "if @xmath2 , then there is no @xmath58-curve and the norm curve @xmath107 is the only one contributing to the total norm @xmath522 .",
    "in particular @xmath684 .",
    "therefore , @xmath685 and the culler - shalen norm on @xmath107 is as stated in the theorem .",
    "if @xmath3 , there is also an @xmath58-curve @xmath109 with @xmath111 . in this case",

    "again , the only choice satisfying propositions  [ prps ] , [ prp2n4 ] and [ prp2n5 ] is @xmath112 of type 1 with @xmath691 .",
    "this completes the proof of the main theorem for the cases @xmath115 and @xmath524 .",
    "there remain the cases @xmath692 .",
    "@xmath693 here @xmath3 , so , following the reasoning of lemma  [ lemrcrv ] , there is an @xmath58-curve @xmath109 with @xmath694 and @xmath111 .",
    "moreover , there is no @xmath58-curve with @xmath680 or @xmath516 .    as for the norm curves , if there s a norm curve of type 1 or 2 , it s the only norm curve .",
    "for example , a norm curve @xmath107 of type 1 has @xmath695 so that all the jumping points for this surgery are on @xmath107 .",
    "this means any other norm curve would have minimal norm for this surgery slope : @xmath679 . however , this is not true for any norm curve , be it of type 1 , 2 , or 3 ..    on the other hand , we need a new type of argument to show that two ( or more ) curves of type 3 is also not a feasible arrangement .",
    "suppose then that there were two type 3 norm curves @xmath107 and @xmath553 .",
    "since @xmath696 and @xmath111 , we see that @xmath697 where we have given the @xmath548 s superscripts showing which curve they come from .",
    "this implies @xmath698 .",
    "but then @xmath699 which contradicts the equation @xmath700 .",
    "thus , we see that there is exactly one norm curve and one @xmath58-curve when @xmath701 . since these must combine to give the total norm , the norm curve is of type 1 with @xmath702 .",
    "@xmath703 in this case there is no @xmath58-curve for @xmath704 . by examining the norm of the @xmath705 slope , we see that if there is a norm curve of type 1 , it is the only curve in @xmath40 containing an irreducible character ( in particular , there are no @xmath58-curves ) .",
    "similarly , if there is a norm curve of type 2 , then there is no @xmath58-curve with @xmath706 .",
    "however , we can not immediately eliminate the possibility of an @xmath58-curve for @xmath680 .",
    "indeed , suppose that there were a type 2 norm curve @xmath107 , together with an @xmath58-curve @xmath109 with @xmath707 .",
    "for the norm curve @xmath107 , @xmath708 @xmath709 on the other hand , for the @xmath58-curve @xmath109 , @xmath710 and also @xmath711 .",
    "this implies @xmath712    since @xmath652 is an even integer , we see that @xmath111 . similarly ,",
    "an examination of the @xmath713 slope also leads us to the conclusion that @xmath111 .",
    "so we can not eliminate the possibility of an @xmath58-curve with @xmath680 directly as we did earlier .",
    "we need a new type of argument to handle this situation .",
    "we need to analyze the possible combinations of curves .",
    "for example , suppose @xmath40 contained a type 2 norm curve @xmath107 and one @xmath58-curve @xmath109 for @xmath707 and _ no other _ norm or @xmath58-curves .",
    "then @xmath714 and @xmath715 so @xmath716    thus , if we assume that these are the only two curves , we see that we can not account for all the jumping points associated with the @xmath713 slope .",
    "therefore , this is not a possible configuration for @xmath40 . by analyzing the possible combinations of norm curves and @xmath58-curves in this way",
    ", we see that the only possibility consistent with propositions  [ prps ] , [ prp2n4 ] , and [ prp2n5 ] is that there is exactly one norm curve of type 1 with @xmath717 and no @xmath58-curves .",
    "@xmath718 a similar analysis shows that @xmath40 contains no @xmath58-curves and exactly one norm curve of type 1 with @xmath719 .",
    "@xmath720 since @xmath3 , we know ( see lemma  [ lemrcrv ] ) that there is an @xmath58-curve @xmath109 for @xmath721 with @xmath722 if we follow the same strategy as in the previous cases we find that there are two possible configurations :    1 .",
    "in addition to the @xmath58-curve there is one type 1 norm curve @xmath107 with @xmath723 2 .",
    "here there is a type 2 norm curve @xmath107 : @xmath724 as well as an additional @xmath58-curve @xmath553 with @xmath706 : @xmath725    both configurations are consistent with propositions  [ prps ] , [ prp2n4 ] , and [ prp2n5 ] : @xmath726 , @xmath727 , and @xmath728 .    in order to show that the second configuration does not arise , note that @xmath729 , the @xmath57 analogue of @xmath553 , would include into @xmath730 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 5.10 ) ) .",
    "now , @xmath731 is seifert fibred over @xmath732 and the jumping points for @xmath733 come from the six irreducible @xmath57-characters of @xmath734 .",
    "if the second configuration is valid , five of these characters are on @xmath729 and therefore come from representations lying in @xmath735 .",
    "we will argue that at least two of them do not .",
    "indeed two of the characters correspond to representations which factor through @xmath736 which has order @xmath737 . on the other hand ,",
    "if such a representation @xmath140 is also in @xmath735 , then it annihilates both the @xmath516 and the @xmath738 slopes . in other words ,",
    "the kernel of @xmath140 contains an index eleven subgroup of @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , @xmath739 is either @xmath740 or else trivial . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath739 also factors through @xmath736 .",
    "thus @xmath739 is trivial and since @xmath741 is normally generated by the peripheral group , @xmath742 as well .",
    "this contradicts the fact that @xmath140 is an irreducible representation .",
    "therefore , the irreducible representations which factor through @xmath736 are not in @xmath735 .",
    "this shows that the second configuration is not possible .",
    "therefore , we have the first configuration .",
    "there is an @xmath58-curve and a norm curve of type 1 with @xmath743 .",
    "@xmath744 this knot was treated using different methods in @xcite ( where it is identified as the twist knot @xmath745 ) .",
    "we saw that there is one norm curve in the character variety and no @xmath58-curves .",
    "moreover , the norm curve corresponds to type 1 with @xmath746 .",
    "this completes the proof of the main theorem .",
    "with the main theorem in hand , we look at applications . since surgeries which result in a manifold having cyclic or finite fundamental group are of small norm",
    ", we can use our knowledge of the culler - shalen seminorms to understand which surgeries might be finite or cyclic . a nice way to visualize",
    "this connection is via the fundamental polygon .    given a culler - shalen seminorm @xmath522 arising from a norm curve in the character variety of a knot @xmath5 , we call @xmath132 , the disc of radius @xmath534 in @xmath44 , a _ fundamental polygon _ for @xmath5 .",
    "a fundamental polygon is a compact , convex , and finite - sided polygon with vertices which are rational multiples of boundary slopes in @xmath747 it is symmetric ( @xmath748 ) and centred at @xmath749 . as we have shown in the main theorem , @xmath16 has only one norm curve @xmath107 which is therefore the canonical curve .",
    "we will refer to the associated polygon as _ the _ fundamental polygon @xmath132 of @xmath16 .    by theorems  [ thcyc ] and [ thfin ] , a cyclic or finite surgery slope either has norm bounded by @xmath750 or else is a boundary slope .",
    "on the other hand , for a small knot like @xmath16 , a cyclic or finite surgery can not occur on a boundary slope .",
    "[ lefinbdy ] if @xmath36 is small and @xmath751 is a boundary slope , then @xmath752 is not cyclic or finite .",
    "* proof : * by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.0.3 ) , @xmath752 is not finite , and it is cyclic only if @xmath753 .",
    "however , gabai  @xcite has shown that , amongst knots in @xmath754 , only slope @xmath675 surgery on the trivial knot can produce @xmath755 .",
    "therefore , as long as @xmath756 , all cyclic and finite surgeries of @xmath16 will lie within @xmath757 , the norm disk of radius @xmath758 .    if the @xmath1 pretzel knot @xmath16 admits a non - trivial cyclic or finite surgery , then one of the following holds .    * @xmath16 is torus , in which case @xmath122,@xmath123 , or @xmath124 , * @xmath125 , in which case @xmath126 and @xmath127 are cyclic fillings while @xmath128 is a finite , non - cyclic filling , or * @xmath129 , in which case @xmath130 and @xmath131 are finite , non - cyclic fillings .",
    "* remark : * a torus knot admits an infinite number of cyclic fillings .",
    "a cyclic filling of a non - trivial knot in @xmath754 is necessarily finite @xcite .",
    "the finite and cyclic surgeries of @xmath759 and @xmath760 were discovered by fintushel and stern ( see  @xcite ) and bleiler and hodgson  @xcite .",
    "the content here is that these are the only non - trivial finite or cyclic surgeries on the non - torus members of this family of knots .",
    "* proof : * let @xmath115 .",
    "the case @xmath761 is the subject of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 10.1 ) where it is shown that there are exactly three non - trivial finite surgeries . for @xmath129 , @xmath762 ( theorem  [ thmm ] )",
    "so any finite or cyclic surgery slopes must lie in @xmath757 .",
    "however , as we see in figure  [ fg239 ] ,    the only slopes inside @xmath757 are @xmath763 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath84 .",
    "if @xmath763 were a finite surgery , then it would be one with norm @xmath758 and therefore dihedral ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.3 ) ) .",
    "however , it can not be dihedral since @xmath763 is odd .",
    "therefore , the @xmath11 pretzel knot admits exactly two non - trivial finite surgeries : @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "as @xmath17 increases , the fundamental polygon for the norm curve maintains the same basic shape but becomes smaller ( the exact coordinates of the polygon are determined by the culler - shalen norm @xmath112 of the main theorem ) . for @xmath764 , the only slopes inside @xmath757 are @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath69 and once @xmath765 , only @xmath103 and @xmath69 remain .",
    "however , since @xmath440 and @xmath483 are seifert fibred over a hyperbolic orbifold when @xmath13 , these are not finite surgeries .",
    "thus the @xmath1 pretzel knots admit no non - trivial cyclic or finite surgeries when @xmath13 .",

    "for these knots , @xmath757 lies below the line @xmath767 .",
    "thus the only surgery slope within @xmath757 is @xmath69 . since @xmath756 for @xmath556",
    ", there can be no non - trivial finite or cyclic surgeries when @xmath556 . for @xmath768 , @xmath769 and any finite or cyclic surgery would have to lie in the polygon @xmath770 ( i.e. , @xmath771 ) .",
    "however , as this polygon also lies below @xmath772 , we again conclude that there are no non - trivial finite or cyclic surgeries when @xmath557 .",
    "this completes the proof of the proposition .",
    "note that , as the five finite fillings of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 pretzel knots are not simply - connected , this constitutes a proof of property p for the @xmath1 pretzel knots .",
    "however , these knots are strongly invertible , so property p was already known @xcite .    as a final application , we derive the newton polygon of the @xmath15-polynomial  @xcite of the @xmath1 knots . recall that the newton polygon of a polynomial @xmath773}$ ] is the convex hull in @xmath774 of @xmath775 .",
    "boyer and zhang have shown that the newton polygon @xmath135 and the fundamental polygon @xmath132 are dual in the following sense .",
    "the line through any pair of antipodal vertices of @xmath132 is parallel to a side of @xmath135 .",
    "conversely , the line through any pair of antipodal vertices of @xmath135 is parallel to a side of @xmath132 .",
    "thus given the fundamental polygon , one can deduce @xmath135 , at least up to scaling and translation .",
    "the conventions we use are that @xmath135 meets the @xmath776 and @xmath91 axes but lies in the first quadrant .",
    "the scale is provided by shanahan s width function .",
    "the @xmath777 width @xmath778 of @xmath135 is one less than the number of lines of slope @xmath777 which intersect @xmath135 and contain a point of the integer lattice .",
