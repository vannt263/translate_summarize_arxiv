    "both @xmath4 and @xmath5 show good mean - field exponents and a close linear relation over much of the accessible pressure range @xcite . on the grounds that the available data follow mean - field scaling around the quantum critical point",
    ", it can not be argued that they provide any evidence for logarithmic corrections , although the size of the experimental errors and the shortage of data very close to the qcp certainly mean they can not be excluded .",
    "it has been argued very recently @xcite , based on a field - theoretic treatment , that the apparent suppression of @xmath4 and @xmath5 visible in the experimental data for tlcucl@xmath6 rather far from the qcp ( at pressures 2 - 4 times the critical pressure ) arises due to logarithmic scaling of the coupling constant . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was assumed that these effects are in fact a consequence of departures from the quantum critical scaling regime , evident also in the violation of linearity between @xmath4 and @xmath5 beyond the point where the order parameter is 60% of the classical moment .",
    "although a direct comparison with our results is not possible without a microscopic treatment of the relationship between the applied pressure and the control parameter , a similar downturn is visible , and better described by including the multiplicative logarithmic corrections , beyond @xmath357 in our figs .",

    "it is also tempting to relate the @xmath358 curve of tlcucl@xmath6 @xcite to our fig .  [ fig : mstn](b ) , where the extended linear regime is followed by an upturn deep inside the nel phase , which was interpreted @xcite as the breakdown of the quantum - thermal decoupling ( see below ) due to a large density of thermally excited magnons when @xmath5 is high .",
    "finally , we have also provided a theoretical explanation for the shape of the classical critical scaling `` fan '' around @xmath359 observed in tlcucl@xmath6 @xcite , by showing that its width scales linearily with @xmath5 , modified by a logarithmic correction with a very small exponent of @xmath360 , which would vary extremely weakly over the experimental pressure window .",
    "although many dimerized @xmath0 systems with antiferromagnetic interactions are known , and many field - induced quantum phase transitions have been studied , few have yet been found to be close to quantum critical points at zero field under pressure .",
    "our results shed light on the experimental challenges inherent in finding logarithmic corrections , but also provide evidence that their detection is actually possible . while important theoretical questions remain to be addressed in lower dimensions , logarithmic corrections are of little relevance away from @xmath48 .",
    "another challenge for both experiment and numerical simulation would be to investigate the exponents and corrections for different @xmath1 , meaning for systems of ising and xy spins .",
    "a related experimental possibility would be to realize the @xmath361 situation in a gas of ultra - cold bosons on an optical lattice .",
    "the unfrustrated dimerized antiferromagnet is a bipartite lattice and thus can be treated exactly as a system of hard - core dimer bosons , with the dimerized phase corresponding to the mott insulator and the antiferromagnet to the superfluid ( a state of long - range inter - site coherence ) ; the symmetry broken is u(1 ) , which is equivalent to xy .",
    "although these experiments have not yet been realized in sufficiently large three - dimensional gases of cold bosons , the very fine parameter control possible in cold - atom systems offers another candidate route for the experimental observation of logarithmic corrections to scaling .",
    "one of the points made in ref .",
    "@xcite was that , although quantum critical phenomena are universal , obeying scaling forms determined only by macroscopic properties of the system such as the dimensionality and the symmetry of the order parameter , their experimental observation depends crucially on non - universal prefactors . for quantum critical excitations ,",
    "this is the ratio of the width of an excitation to its energy , and is a quantity determined entirely by microscopic details . for both static and dynamic properties ,",
    "the key figure of merit is the width of the quantum critical regime , and for this we have obtained a quantitative result not previously available by any other technique , @xmath351 . in as much as one may generalize from the dimensionality and geometry of the double cubic lattice , this 20% criterion dictates the necessary proximity to the quantum critical point for the observation of strict quantum critical scaling , including logarithmic corrections .",
    "our demonstration of linearity between @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the @xmath155d heisenberg antiferromagnet lies beyond any results previously predicted by analytical methods .",
    "what we have demonstrated explicitly for several quantities is the presence of expected logarithmic corrections , but their cancellation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 was not anticipated .",
    "however , in parallel to our scaling argument for the logarithmic corrections to @xmath5 , scammell and sushkov have recently arrived at the same conclusion from a different starting point @xcite .",
    "a key outstanding question is whether the linearity of @xmath319 is in fact a more fundamental property of the system than arguments made at the semiclassical and mean - field levels suggest .",
    "qualitatively , the origin of linearity is thought @xcite to lie in the effective decoupling of the classical and quantum fluctuations , which is applicable for all coupling ratios both outside and inside the qc regime .",
