    "the flux and the spectrum of reactor antineutrinos depend not only on the current reactor state , which is specified by the power level and the isotope composition of the nuclear fuel used , but also on the preceding evolution of the fuel .",
    "the spectrum of antineutrinos produced in the beta decay of fission products and other radioactive nuclei accumulated in the reactor core begin to evolve toward equilibrium after the start - up of a reactor .",
    "after reactor shutdown , the antineutrino radiation diminishes for a long time .    in [ 1 , 2 ] ,",
    "equilibration of the spectrum and the reduction of the soft section of the @xmath0 spectrum , where the effects of preceding evolution are pronounced , were analyzed in connection with the problem of searches for the neutrino magnetic moment in experiments studying @xmath1 scattering .    in this study",
    ", we consider the inverse - beta - decay process @xmath2 and antineutrino spectrum above the threshold for this reaction ( 1.804 mev ) . presently , reaction ( 1 ) is of interest mainly as a tool for seeking neutrino neutrino oscillations in reactor experiments .    in this case , the oscillations in question are manifested in the disappearance of some fraction of the @xmath0 flux and in a characteristic modulation of the @xmath0 spectrum , the latter being specified by the factor @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mixing parameter , @xmath5 is the mass parameter measured in electronvolts squared , @xmath6 is the distance ( in meters ) between the source and detector , and @xmath7 is the detected neutrino energy measured in megaelectronvolts .    in experiments seeking the above oscillations ,",
    "the @xmath0 spectrum and flux measured with the aid of reaction ( 1 ) are compared with their values expected in the absence of the oscillations . in this case , use is made of the reactor @xmath0 spectrum obtained independently ( @xmath0 spectrum at the production instant ) .",
    "uncertainties in determining this spectrum restrict the sensitivity of the method , and systematic error in the spectrum shape may generally mimic or mask the oscillation effect .",
    "procedures that are applied to analyze data from experiments seeking oscillations were described in more detail elsewhere ( see , for example , [ 3 ] ) . as a rule , equilibration of the spectrum and the reduction of the @xmath0 spectrum",
    "do not lead to considerable effects in the region @xmath8 .",
    "however , their role can be greatly enhanced in some cases that will be discussed in section 4 .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we give a brief account of available data on the spectrum of reactor @xmath0 in the region @xmath8 and on the cross section for reaction ( 1 ) . in section 3",
    ", we consider the evolution of the spectrum in the reactor operating period and residual antineutrino radiation in the reactor shutdown period and determine the relevant cross sections .",
    "section 4 is devoted to discussing the results .",
    "let us briefly review the basic properties of the reactor - antineutrino spectrum in the energy region above 1.8 mev and the spectrum - averaged cross section for reaction ( 1 ) ( see , for example , [ 1 , 2 , 4 - 8 ] and references therein ) .",
    "the standard approach is based on the following assumptions :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +    \\(i ) the @xmath0 spectrum is formed exclusively by the beta decays of the fragments produced in a reactor upon the fission of @xmath9 and @xmath10 isotopes .",
    "\\(ii ) for each isotope , the equilibrium spectrum is established within a small time interval that can be neglected . at the instant under consideration , the reactor - antineutrino spectrum @xmath11 measured in ( mev)@xmath12 units per fission event can then be expressed in terms of the spectra @xmath11 for four fissile isotopes",
    ". specifically , we have @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the contribution of a given isotope to the number of fission events occurring in a reactor at this instant , the subscript values of @xmath15 , and 1 labeling the quantities associated with the fissile isotopes @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath10    because of @xmath16 depletion and the accumulation of fissile plutonium isotopes , the contributions @xmath14 entering into eq . ( 3 ) change , which leads to a change in the total spectrum @xmath11 over the reactor operating period .",
    "as was mentioned above , the spectra @xmath19 are assumed to be time - independent .",
    "information about current @xmath14 values is presented by the reactor personnel , the relative error in these values being set to 5% .",
    "the spectra @xmath19 for @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath10 were obtained in [ 5 ] by the conversion method , which enables one to reconstruct the relevant antineutrino spectrum on the basis of the total spectrum of beta- decay electrons from the set of the fragments of a given fissile isotope .",
    "for a few tens of hours , thin layers of the aforementioned isotopes were exposed to a thermal - neutron flux from the reactor installed at ill ( grenoble ) , and the current spectra of electrons from the beta decay of fragments were simultaneously measured in the energy region above 2.0 mev for @xmath16 and in the energy region above 1.8 mev for @xmath17 and @xmath10 . after approximately 12 hours of irradiation , the beta spectra reached saturation and changed ii longer .",
    "therefore , the antineutrino spectra @xmath19 reconstructed on the basis of these @xmath20 spectra are actually those that are established after about one day of fuel irradiation . for @xmath18 ,",
    "use was made of the spectrum calculated in [ 6 ] because the beta spectrum was not measured for the fragments of e1 isotope .    the expected number of events of the interaction between antineutrinos and target protons was calculated in terms of the cross section @xmath21 for reaction ( 1 ) , @xmath22 where @xmath23 being the reaction cross section for monoenergetic antineutrinos [ 7 ] .    in terms of @xmath24 @xmath25 units per fission event ,",
    "the @xmath26 values calculated in this way are @xmath27 these calculations were performed with the9 constants corresponding to the free - neutron lifetime of @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting error in the cross section ( 4 ) is 2.7% ( 68% c.l . ) .    to a higher precision ,",
    "the cross section for reaction ( 1 ) is known from an experiment performed by the kurchatov institute - college de france - lapp collaboration at a distance of 15 m from the bugey pwr reactor [ 8 ] : @xmath29 this result corresponds to the following contributions a ; from fissile isotopes : @xmath30    the proportion in ( 7 ) for the number of isotope - fission events is typical for pwr reactors , which were used in the majority of experiments seeking the oscillations in question . within the errors , the cross section in ( 6 )",
    "agrees with the reaction cross section @xmath21 found for the given composition of nuclear fuel : @xmath31    the experimental value in ( 6 ) is treated as a metrological reference for the cross section in the absence of oscillations .",
    "a feature peculiar to this reference is that , in each specific case of its application , it must be rescaled to the relevant composition of nuclear fuel . as a result",
    ", the error in the cross section increases to about 1.6% .    for reactors of the type",
    "being considered , the duration of the operating period is approximately one year .",
    "after that , the reactor is shut down for 30 - 40 days , and one - third of the fuel is replaced by a new load of fuel .",
    "therefore , the fuel is irradiated for three years .",
    "the detector background is measured during reactor shutdown periods .",
    "it is assumed that antineutrino emission in the region @xmath32 mev ceases completely within one day after reaction shutdown .",
    "the above information forms a basis for analyzing and interpreting the results of experiments seeking neutrino oscillations in reactor experiments .",
    "\\1 . let us determine more precisely sources that contribute to the formation of the reactor - antineutrino spectrum @xmath11 , @xmath33    the first term in ( 9 ) describes radiation from the set of fragments produced in @xmath9 and @xmath10 fission , their interactions with neutrons being disregarded here ; the second term takes into account additional radiation arising in radiative neutron capture by accumulated fragments .    for an irradiation time of @xmath34 day , each of the spectra @xmath35 for the four isotopes @xmath9 and @xmath10 were calculated as functions of the duration of fuel irradiation . in this calculation , the fission rate was assumed to be constant for each isotope .",
    "the residual - radiation spectra @xmath36 were also calculated as functions of the time @xmath37 from the end of fission .",
    "the calculations were performed by summing , at each instant , the contributions from individual fission fragments with allowance for their yields from the fission process , decay diagrams , and lifetimes .",
    "the database that we used contains information about 571 fission fragments whose cumulative yields are not less than @xmath38 each . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the activity of the majority of the fragments that can contribute in the energy region @xmath32 mev reaches saturation within one day after the onset of the fission process , and a further increase is due to only six fission products whose properties are well known .",
    "three of them - @xmath39 ( @xmath40 mev ) @xmath41 ( @xmath42 mev ) , and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 mev ) - attain equilibrium within ten days .",
    "a further slow increase is determined by the @xmath45 and @xmath46 half - lives ( see ( 10 ) ) .",
    "@xmath47    finally , some contribution comes from @xmath48 h , @xmath49 mev ) as well , which is in equilibrium with its very long - lived predecessor @xmath50 ( @xmath51 yr ) .",
    "the yields of these fission fragments are quoted in the table .",
    "the antineutrino spectra calculated for @xmath16 and @xmath17 are displayed in figs .",

    "2a and 2b ( decrease ) . for four fissile isotopes , figs .",
    "3 and 4 show , respectively , the cross sections @xmath52 for reaction ( 1 ) in the fission process and the decrease in @xmath53 in the residual - radiation spectra . in figs . 1 - 4 ,",
    "the spectra and cross sections are presented in dimensionless units and are normalized to the corresponding values after a lapse of @xmath54 = 1 day from the onset of the fission process .     and ( b ) @xmath17 fission to the spectrum after one day of irradiation .",
    "the numbers on the curves indicate the irradiation time.,width=283 ]     and ( b)@xmath17 irradiated for two years to the spectrum after one day of irradiation .",
    "the numbers on the curves indicate the time that have elapsed after the termiation of irradiation.,width=283 ]    \\3 . the correction @xmath11 was calculated with allowance for fragments accumulated in a reactor , the cross sections for radiative neutron capture , and the spatial and energy distributions of the neutron flux over the reactor core .",
    "the results presented in fig . 5 refer to a standard operating period of a pwr reactor .",
    "the relevant contribution @xmath55 to the cross section for reaction ( 1 ) is about 0.2% at the end of the operating period .",
    "after reactor shutdown , the spectrum @xmath55 decreases fast , not making a significant contribution to residual radiation .",
    "\\(i ) in the approximation specified in section 2 , the flux and the spectrum of reactor antineutrinos are un- ambiguously determined by the current reactor state . after sharp changes in this state ,",
    "the characteristics of the @xmath0 flux take the corresponding equilibrium values within a time as short as one day . in particular , the antineutrino flux falls down to zero within one day after reactor shutdown .     to that after one day of irradiation.,width=283 ]     after the termination of irradiation.,width=283 ]     after the termination of irradiation.,width=283 ]    as a matter of fact , the antineutrino flux in the region @xmath32 mev has been found to have a nonequilibrium component , whose relaxation time exceeds the duration of the reactor operation period . in a view of this , a determaination of the @xmath0 spectrum and of the corresponding values of the cross section for reaction ( 1 ) requires tracing the preceding evolution of reactor operation over a long time and taking into account power levels , shutdown periods and the discharge of spent reactor fuel . in each specific case , this can be done , if needed to a sufficient precision .",
    "the sample of the results in section 3 , which were obtained under assumption that the fission of uranium and plutonium isotopes proceeds at a constant rate , has enabled us to reveal qualitative features of effects induced by the nonequilibrium component .",
    "\\(ii ) first of all , we note that the resulting corrections to the spectrum and cross sections are relatively small , but they are not negligible . in the antineutrino energy range 1.8 - 3.5 mev , the relative contribution of the additional radiation during the reactor operating period ( figs .",
    "1 , 5 ) is about 4% , which is somewhat greater than the error of the ill spectra [ 5 ] .",
    "the corrections to the cross sections cr , in fig . 3 and the correction associated with radiative neutron capture may change the cross sections @xmath21 by 0.4 - 0.6% . as a result , relation ( 8) will change accordingly .",
    "corrections on the same order of magnitude may arise if the cross section ( 6 ) is used as a reference value for the cross section in the absence of the oscillations .",
    "\\(iii ) here , we consider a situation where residual radiation from a stopped reactor can play a significant role and provide numerical examples illustrating the scale of the effects under discussion .",
    "let us consider an experiment where antineutrinos from reactors are recorded by one detector positioned in such a way that the reactors are at markedly different distances from the detector .",
    "such an experimental setting was implemented , for example , in rovno ( distances of 18 and 98 m ) and in the bugey-3 experiment ( 15 and 95 m ) [ 9 ] ; three reactors in krasnoyarsk were located at distances of 57 , 57 , and 234 m from the detector [ 10 ] .",
    "the idea of these experiments consists in using the shutdown and operating periods to determine the background level and the signals from each individual reactor . by comparing these signals",
    ", one can reveal the oscillation effect or set limits on the oscillation parameters .    by way of example , we consider two identical pwr reactors of thermal power 2.8 gw each and a detector positioned at distances of 15 and 100 m from the near and the far reactor , respectively , so    fig.5",
    ". ratio of the spectrum component ? ( a ) associated with neutron capture by fission products in a pwr reactor to the fission spectrum p(e ) .",
    "curves / , 2 , and 8 correspond to the beginning , middle , and end of the reactor operating period .    that the signal from the near reactor is approximately 45 times as great as that from the far one . in this case , the numbers of events of reaction ( 1 ) that are induced by the near and the far reactor per 1 t of a @xmath56 target per day are @xmath57 day@xmath12 t@xmath12 and @xmath58 day@xmath12 t@xmath12 , respectively .    when both reactors are shut down , the detector records , however , the residual interaction in addition to the background . within one to two days after the shutdown of the near reactor , the number of interaction events induced by the residual radiation from it in the detector per unit time decreases by a factor of about 200 , falling down to a value of @xmath59 day@xmath12 t@xmath12 , which is approximately 25% of the signal from the far reactor .",
    "after that , the signal from the residual radiation decreases smoothly ( see fig .",
    "4 ) until the discharge of the spent fuel begins , which significantly affects detector readings .    obviously",
    ", these cases require a new approach to processing and analyzing experimental data .",
    "the effect of the equilibration of the reactor - antineutrino spectrum on the cross section for the inverse - beta - decay process ( 1 ) with the threshold of 1.8 mev has been considered .",
    "the increase in the antineutrino flux due to an increase in the cross section ( this effect was previously ignored ) is about 0.6% over the reactor operating period .",
    "this value is commensurate with the accuracy ( the standard error is 1.4% ) in the measurement of the cross section itself .",
    "a correction at this level must also be introduced in the ratio of the measured cross section to the cross section calculated on the basis of the antineutrino spectrum that was determined independently and which corresponds to one day of reactor operation .",
    "we have calculated the additional contribution to the antineutrino spectrum from neutron capture by fission products and determined the corresponding increase ( 0.2% ) in the cross section for reaction ( 1 ) .",
    "it has been found that corrections previously ignored in the standard experimental scheme aimed at searches for neutrino oscillations ( one detector and near and far reactors ) may be as large as 25% .",
