    "m100 ( ngc 4321 ) is a ` grand - design ' late - type spiral , which has hosted 4 supernovae since 1900 , has a prominent , star - forming circumnuclear region , and is located in the virgo cluster .",
    "previous x - ray observations of m100 led to the detection of the most recent supernova in the galaxy ( sn 1979c ) and of a number of other point sources @xcite .    here",
    ", we report on x - ray point sources found in high - angular resolution x - ray observations of m100 made with chandra .",
    "results on the nuclear emission from the same data were previously reported in @xcite .",
    "we selected this galaxy for study because it is seen nearly face - on which reduces ambiguity in determining the environments of x - ray sources , because it contains sn 1979c which was previously detected in x - rays @xcite , and because of the question of the association of an x - ray source with the nucleus remains open @xcite .",
    "we describe the chandra observations and our analysis in  2 and discuss the results in  3 .",
    "m100 was observed with the chandra x - ray observatory ( cxo ; weisskopf 1988 ) on 6 nov 1999 and 15 jan 2000 using the acis spectroscopic array ( acis - s ; bautz et al .",
    "1998 ) in imaging mode and the high - resolution mirror assembly ( hrma ; van speybroeck et al .  1997 ) .",
    "the galaxy fits almost completely on the s3 chip with a small portion of the @xmath1 ellipse on the s2 chip .",
    "we found no point sources within the portion of the @xmath1 ellipse on the s2 chip and the analysis below includes only data from s3 .",
    "level 2 data products from the standard processing ( version r4cu5upd11.2 ) were used .",
    "the processing includes standard cuts on ccd event grades , elimination of events from hot pixels , hot columns , and near node boundaries , and removal of cosmic ray induced events .",

    "both observations are recorded in chandra obsid 400 .",
    "we created images in the 0.47  kev band at the full acis resolution of @xmath4 for each observation and for the combined data .",
    "we searched the images for point sources using wavdetect ( ciao v2.0 ) and visually inspected each image .",
    "for the two sources near the nucleus of m100 , wavdetect reported source ellipses well in excess of the hrma / acis point spread function .",
    "these large source ellipses are likely due to diffuse emission in this region and we chose to use source regions consistent with the point spread function rather than those reported by wavdetect .",
    "the merged list of sources with detection significance above @xmath5 and within the @xmath1 ellipse of m100 is given in table  [ chandra_src ] .",

    "the relative positions should be somewhat better .",
    "for each source , counts from the full data set in the energy bands 0.417  kev were extracted from source regions with a radius of 2 pixels for sources near the aimpoint and larger elliptical regions for sources further out .",
    "the counts were background subtracted using a circular background regions with radii equal to 3 times the major axis of the source ellipse and with ellipses twice the size of the source regions excluded ( for both the source of interest and any sources overlapping the background region ) .",
    "for each source , we calculated the x - ray count rate in the 0.47  kev band and an x - ray color ( hardness ratio ) defined as counts in the 1 - 7  kev band minus counts in the 0.41  kev divided by the total counts in the 0.47  kev band .",
    "the x - ray colors were corrected to the values which would have been measured at the aimpoint using exposure maps for 0.7 and 2.4  kev , which correspond to the average photon energies for the point sources in the two bands .",
    "count rates were converted to luminosities in the 0.47  kev band assuming a thermal bremsstrahlung model with @xmath8 and corrected for absorption along the line of sight with a column density of @xmath9 and assuming a distance of 16.1  mpc @xcite .",
    "the count rates were corrected for the fraction of events contained in the extraction region and for exposure using an exposure map for 1.5  kev .",
    "the @xmath10 thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum is consistent with the x - ray colors for most of the sources ( see below ) .",
    "the previously used @xmath11 thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum @xcite is not consistent with the x - ray colors .",
    "however , use of @xmath12 would increase the luminosities only by a factor of 1.3 .",
    "use of a power - law with photon index 2 would increase them by 1.1 .",
    "for comparison with rosat measurements @xcite , the luminosities in table  [ chandra_src ] should be multiplied by 1.0 to find the equivalent luminosity in the 0.12.4 band assuming a thermal bremsstrahlung model with @xmath13 for a distance of 17.1  mpc .",
    "table  [ chandra_src ] gives the properties of the x - ray point sources detected with chandra .",
    "[ dssb_x ] shows the locations of the chandra sources superimposed on a digitized sky survey blue image of m100 .",
    "the chandra sources lie either on spiral arms , in hii regions near spirals arms , or near the nucleus , i.e.  at regions of active star formation .",
    "this supports the idea that luminous x - ray sources ( @xmath14 ) are preferentially associated with recent star formation @xcite .    comparing the sources detected with chandra with those detected with rosat and einstein @xcite",
    ", we find several variable sources .",
    "allowing for the uncertainty in the luminosity due to the lack of spectral information , we require a factor of @xmath15 change as evidence of variability .",
    "the chandra source c6 was undetected with rosat and appears to have increased in flux by a factor of at least 3 .",
    "the chandra upper bound on the luminosity of the rosat source h17 @xcite is at least a factor of 4 below the rosat measurement . the rosat source h24 appears to have decreased in flux by a factor of at least 2 in the chandra observation .",
    "the source c2 = h21 may also be variable , but caution is warranted before reaching this conclusion as the rosat flux may include some diffuse emission due to the larger point spread function of rosat .",
    "this source was also detected with einstein at a comparable flux .",
    "the rosat sources h18 and h19 were detected at lower fluxes ( the rosat observation was 43  ks compared to only 2.5  ks for chandra ) and their variability can not be constrained from the short chandra observation .",
    "a longer chandra observation would be useful .",
    "h19 was detected with einstein at a much higher flux than with rosat and is clearly variable .",
    "the sources h22 = c4 and h25 = c5 appear constant .",
    "the nucleus of m100 ( rosat source h 23 ) resolves with chandra into two sources : c1 and c3 .",
    "there is also diffuse emission present in the low background image near the two point sources .",
    "c1 lies @xmath16 away from the nuclear position derived from digitized sky survey images which has an uncertainty of @xmath17 @xcite . to further investigate association of the c1 with the nucleus",
    ", we examined the first radio survey data at 1.4  ghz for m100 @xcite .",
    "the first catalog @xcite contains two sources inside a region of extended emission near the nucleus , see fig .",
    "[ firstmap ] .",
    "c1 is not coincident with either first source and lies outside the peak of the diffuse emission .",
    "c1 lies @xmath18 away from the closer first source ( which lies within the optical nuclear error box ) .",
    "the offset between c1 and the first source is significantly larger than the astrometric uncertainty of chandra of @xmath19 at 90% confidence and the uncertainty of the first position which is less than @xmath20 at 90% confidence .",
    "the first and chandra positions for sn 1979c , see below , agree within @xmath21 indicating there are no gross errors in the x - ray positions .",
    "hence , we exclude an identification of c1 with the bright radio sources near the nucleus of m100 .",
    "we note that m100 does not show evidence for agn activity at other wavelengths @xcite .",
    "c1 is the only source which shows significant variability between the two chandra observations .",
    "the variability indicates the source is likely a compact object .",
    "the circumnuclear region of m100 is undergoing vigorous star formation with some star clusters as young as a few 10  myr @xcite .",
    "hence , the presence of bright x - ray point sources near the nucleus is not unexpected and is likely related to the young stellar population .",
    "the majority of the x - ray sources in m100 are variable and are likely x - ray binaries .",
    "the sources are not more luminous than known x - ray binaries within the milky way , e.g.4u154347 @xcite .",
    "hence , they may be normal stellar black hole candidates x - ray binaries with black masses near @xmath22 and , perhaps , mildly beamed .",
    "the luminosities are not high enough to warrant the application of exotic models as may be required for very high luminosity sources , e.g.  the @xmath23 source in m82 @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ color_lum ] , we show the x - ray color versus x - ray luminosity ( both defined in table  [ chandra_src ] ) of the chandra sources . excluding the softest source , which is a supernova discussed below , the colors lie in the range from -0.2 , corresponding to a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum with @xmath24 or a power - law spectrum with photon index @xmath25 , to + 0.6 , corresponding to @xmath26 or @xmath27 , assuming a column density of @xmath9 .",
    "such spectra are reasonable for accreting x - ray binaries at these luminosities .",
    "using the x - ray point source luminosity function derived from a rosat survey of nearby spiral galaxies @xcite , we estimate that roughly 1.4 x - ray sources with @xmath28 would be expected in m100 given its blue luminosity .",
    "we find 6 sources .",
    "the number of x - ray point sources versus blue luminosity in m100 is similar to that found for m101 @xcite and is likely related to active star formation , as has been suggested for m101 @xcite .",
    "star formation in m100 is concentrated along the spiral arms @xcite as are the chandra sources .",
    "the rosat source h25 was identified with the supernova sn 1979c @xcite .",
    "our chandra position places the source c5 only @xmath21 away from the supernovae  within the 90% confidence error circle  and greatly strengthens this association .",
    "none of the other known supernovae are detected with chandra .",
    "sn 1901b and sn 1959e are type i supernova @xcite , so no x - ray emission would be expected @xcite .",
    "the type of sn 1914a is not known .    unfortunately , there are too few photons ( @xmath29 ) detected with chandra from sn 1979c to make definitive statements about the spectrum ( e.g.  whether it is thermal line emission versus continuum emission ) .",
    "the source is the softest of those found in m100 .",
    "the x - ray color , defined above , of @xmath30 is consistent with a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum with @xmath31 , or a power - law spectrum with photon index of 2.3 to 4.3 .",
    "this assumes a column density of @xmath9 ; higher absorption would imply a softer intrinsic spectrum .",
    "the spectrum is significantly softer than the assumed spectrum used in calculating luminosities in table  [ chandra_src ] or in @xcite . recalculating the luminosity using a more appropriate spectrum , thermal bremsstrahlung with @xmath32",
    ", we find a luminosity of @xmath33 in the 0.12.4  kev band and a luminosity from the rosat data of @xmath34 in the same band .",
    "the chandra and rosat fluxes for the source h25 = c5 are not strongly inconsistent given the uncertainties due to spectral shape and inter instrument calibration .",
    "the source appears to have had a roughly constant , or perhaps slightly declining , luminosity over the 4.3 years separating the two observations .",
    "the constancy of the x - ray luminosity of sn 1979c over 4  years beginning 16 years after outburst is similar to the x - ray light curve of sn 1978k in ngc 1313 which showed a constant luminosity of @xmath35 over the period 1216 years after outburst @xcite .",
    "sn 1979c was discovered on 19 april 1979 near maximum optical light @xcite and has been extensively observed .",
    "the optical light curve had a linear decline , leading to classification as a type ii , subclass ` l ' or ` linear ' @xcite .",
    "the total radiative energy in the event was @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the progenitor is thought to be a red supergiant with a mass near @xmath37 and may have been in a binary @xcite .",
    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations led to tentative identification of an optical counterpart to sn 1979c @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath38 flux from the counterpart would imply an h@xmath38 to x - ray flux ratio of @xmath39 during 19951996 .",
    "the interaction of supernova ejecta with surrounding matter previously lost by the progenitor provides an adequate explanation of optical , uv , and radio data on sn 1979c @xcite .",
    "radio emission was detected one year after outburst with the maximum emission at 6  cm shortly after the first detection and the maximum at 20  cm three years after outburst @xcite . this delayed turn - on with increasing delay at longer wavelengths appears due to decreasing free - free absorption in ionized gas around the supernova and is well explained by the circumstellar interaction model @xcite .",
    "the same model also explains the observed uv lines @xcite .",
    "circumstellar interactions could produce the observed roughly constant luminosity if the supernova ejecta and the circumstellar matter have the appropriate radial dependence @xcite .",
    "such a process could produce adequate luminosity and the h@xmath38 to x - ray flux ratio is in reasonable agreement with model predictions @xcite .",
    "a soft x - ray spectrum would be expected , which is consistent with the chandra constraints .",
    "the circumstellar interaction model appears consistent with all the available x - ray constraints .",
    "alternative explanations of the x - ray emission are possible if a compact object was formed in sn 1979c",
    ". the x - ray emission might arise from a rotation - powered pulsar or from accretion on to a compact object fueled either by a binary companion or by matter from the progenitor which has fallen back onto the compact object @xcite .",
    "sufficient flux could be produced by either method of accretion ( a black hole would be required to avoid violating the eddington limit if the emission is unbeamed ) , but a variable or declining flux and , perhaps , a somewhat harder spectrum than is observed might be expected .",
    "the presence of a pulsar in sn 1979c has been suggested to explain the radio light curves @xcite .",
    "the behavior of very young pulsars is unknown with a key question being the efficiency for conversion of spin - down power to observable x - ray emission .",
    "x - rays would likely come mainly from a surrounding synchrotron nebula and produce a relatively hard power - law x - ray spectrum , mildly inconsistent with the chandra constraints . with additional x - ray observations , it would be possible to search for variability and perhaps also to determine whether the x - ray emission is thermal line emission or due to a continuum process and to accurately measure the spectral parameters .",
