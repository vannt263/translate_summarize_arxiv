    "quantum chromodynamics  ( qcd ) predicts that deconfined phase transition will take place at high temperature and/or high density , as a result the nuclear matter will undergo a transition to quark - gluon plasma  ( qgp ) .",
    "one main goal for relativistic heavy ion collider  ( rhic ) and large hadronic collider  ( lhc ) is to seek this new state of matter .",
    "there are two striking findings at rhic .",
    "one is that the deconfined hot medium behaviors as a nearly perfect fluid with a small viscosity@xcite .",
    "several groups have applied viscous hydrodynamics to simulate the evolution of the produced matter in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the simulations successfully fit the observables at rhic , such as the elliptic flow , the particle spectra , etc  @xcite .",
    "the other is the strong jet quenching , which is believed to be a potential signal for the qgp formation@xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that the first lhc results also strongly support similar conclusions as seen at rhic@xcite .    at the very early stage of the relativistic heavy ion collisions , named glasma stage  @xcite , and the late stage of the evolution process in the near @xmath1 region in the so - called magnetic scenario for the qgp  @xcite",
    ", there are color - electric flux tubes which contain strong color - electric fields in them .",
    "therefore , the color electromagnetic properties may play an important role in the evolution of hot and dense matter produced in heavy ion collisions .",
    "in addition , color electromagnetic properties could reflect the response of qgp to external color current , so the study of them may be helpful for understanding the nature of qgp .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , the study on the color electromagnetic properties of viscous qgp is scare in literature .",
    "it makes sense to study how the viscosity affects them and how the viscous electromagnetic properties affect the evolution of produced matter in heavy ion collisions .",
    "refraction index is one important electromagnetic property which reflects the propagation of light in the medium .",
    "it can be determined in terms of the electric permittivity @xmath2 and magnetic permeability @xmath3 . in 1968 ,",
    "veselago proposed in theory that the refraction index might be negative in some special material@xcite .",
    "that kind of medium is in nature consistent with the one proposed by mandelstam in which the electromagnetic phase velocity propagates antiparallel to the energy flow@xcite . but",
    "no any natural material shows such special properties .",
    "around 2000 , by manipulating the array of small and closely spaced elements , scientists have constructed the negative refraction material in laboratory@xcite , since then , the study on the negative refraction has attracted intensive interest .",
    "recently , amariti et al . have studied the refraction index of the strong coupled system with the string - inspired theory of ads / cft correspondence@xcite .",
    "then , some investigations have been carried out in strong coupled and correlation systems along that line@xcite .",
    "it is argued that the negative refraction is a general phenomenon in some frequency range in charged fluid systems@xcite .",
    "the probability for the existence of negative refraction in qgp is discussed as well in that literature@xcite .",
    "later , juan liu et al . extended the study of the refractive index of light to the weak coupled quark gluon system within the framework of the hard thermal loop perturbative theory@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will make a first step to study the refraction index of gluon in the viscous qgp with the viscous chromohydrodynamics .",
    "gluon is the qcd counterpart of photon . in addition",
    ", jet quenching has been proposed as a potential signal for the qgp and become an active field in heavy ion collisions in last three decades , which is relevant to the parton propagation in the hot medium .",
    "so the study of gluon refraction in qgp may be helpful for the understanding of the nature of the qgp . according to the refs.@xcite",
    ", viscosity will modify the distribution functions of the constituents of the qgp , thus it will affect the gluon self - energy through which the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability can be derived .",
    "therefore , viscosity will have an impact on the refraction index .",
    "it is argued that chromohydrodynamics can describe the polarization effect as the kinetic theory  @xcite . in a recent paper@xcite ,",
    "some authors have extended the ideal chromohydrodynamics  @xcite to the viscous one in terms of the qgp kinetic theory and the distribution function modified by the shear viscosity . under that framework ,",
    "the polarization tensor is derived and the color - electric permittivity in the viscous qgp is studied in details@xcite .",
    "based on the color - electric permittivity , the induced color charge distribution@xcite and the corresponding wake potential@xcite induced by the fast parton traveling through the viscous qgp have been investigated later .",
    "in the present paper , by following the gluon polarization tension derived from the viscous chromohydrodynamcs , we will derive the magnetic permeability and then study the refraction index in the qgp associated with shear viscosity .",
    "our main results are as follows . within the framework of the viscous chromohydrodynamics ,",
    "the refraction index in the viscous qgp becomes negative in some frequency range .",
    "the start point of that frequency range is around the electric permittivity pole , while the magnetic permeability pole determines the end point .",
    "in addition , with the increase of @xmath0 , the frequency range for the existence of the negative refraction becomes broadening .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will briefly review the formulism of electromagnetic properties in medium . in section 3 , according to the polarization tension derived from the viscous chromohydrodynamics , we evaluated the refraction index and discussed the viscous effect on it .",
    "section 4 is summary and remarks .",
    "the natural units @xmath4 , the metric @xmath5 and the following notations @xmath6 are used in the paper .",
    "in order to describe the electric and magnetic properties in plasma covariantly , it is convenient to introduce a pair of four - vectors @xmath7 , @xmath8 in terms of the fluid four - velocity @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 where the greek index @xmath12 is not confused with the magnetic permeability @xmath13 . according to eqs.([f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) , one can obtain the fourier - transformed free action @xmath14 taking into account the interaction between the constituents of plasma , the correction to the action is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is vector boson field in momentum space , and @xmath17 is polarization tensor which embodies the medium effects in plasma . in homogeneous and isotropic medium , the polarization tensor can be divided into longitudinal and transverse parts @xmath18 with projector defined as @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21@xcite .",

    ", one can get the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability in plasma as following : @xmath25 @xmath26    we have briefly reviewed the electric and magnetic properties in homogeneous and isotropic plasma , the detailed derivation also can be found in refs.@xcite . in addition , the extension of the discussion to the anisotropic medium was also addressed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the refraction index is generally defined by the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability as @xmath27 which is a square definition and not sensitive to the simultaneous change of signs of @xmath24 and @xmath13 .",
    "but it is proposed by veselago that the simultaneous change of positive @xmath24 and @xmath13 to negative @xmath28 and @xmath29 corresponds to the transformation of the refraction index from one branch @xmath30 to the other @xmath31 , ie , the turn from the general refraction index to the negative one .",
    "the physical nature of the negative refraction is that the electromagnetic phase velocity propagates opposite to the energy flow . for the detailed discussion on the physics of negative refraction",
    ", please refer to the refs.@xcite .",
    "the criterion for the negative refraction is @xmath32 and @xmath33 simultaneously for real electric permittivity and magnetic permeability medium .",
    "if dissipation is taken into account , the situation is complicated .",
    "the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability are generally complex - valued functions of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , such as @xmath36 , @xmath37 , so does the refraction index @xmath38 . according to the phase velocity propagating antiparallel to the energy flow",
    ", some authors have derived the condition for negative refraction in dissipative medium and found it is not necessary for @xmath39 and @xmath40 simultaneously@xcite .",
    "later , another simple , convenient and widely adopted condition has been derived as @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is called depine - lakhtakia index .",
    "@xmath43 implies @xmath44 , otherwise we will have a normal refraction index . in this paper",
    ", we will use criterion ( [ neff ] ) to study if there exists the negative refraction in the viscous qgp .",
    "in this section , we will briefly review the derivation of the viscous chromohydrodynamics applicable to qgp with shear viscosity .",
