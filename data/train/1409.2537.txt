    "in this article we address the following problem of mathematical physics .",
    "( we first formulate the mathematical problem as such , and then indicate its origin in physics . )",
    "let there be a hermitian vector space @xmath5 with @xmath6 a sufficiently large integer , and let @xmath7 have the additional structure of a non - degenerate symmetric complex bilinear form @xmath8 .",
    "assume that @xmath7 carries an action by operators @xmath9 that satisfy the clifford algebra relations @xmath10 and preserve @xmath11 as well as @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath13 be a @xmath1-dimensional manifold , namely momentum space or phase space , with an involution @xmath14 whose physical meaning is momentum inversion .",
    "our objects of interest then are rank-@xmath6 complex vector bundles @xmath15 whose fibers @xmath16 are constrained for all @xmath17 by the conditions @xmath18 we refer to them as vector bundles of symmetry class @xmath2 , or class @xmath2 for short .",
    "the goal is to give a homotopy classification for the `` classifying maps '' @xmath19 of such vector bundles . in the present paper",
    "we achieve this goal for the case of the @xmath1-sphere , @xmath20 , and for @xmath6 large enough relative to @xmath1 . a companion paper @xcite deals with the case of @xmath21 .",
    "we now explain briefly how the posed problem arises from a situation of current interest in condensed matter physics .",
    "our objects of study are systems of `` free fermions '' ; more precisely , systems of fermions described in the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) mean - field approximation by any hamiltonian which is quadratic in the operators creating or annihilating a single particle .",
    "the many - particle ground state of such a system is called an hfb mean - field ground state , or free - fermion ground state , or quasi - particle vacuum . the homotopy theory developed in the present",
    "paper addresses those cases where the hamiltonian commutes with a group @xmath22 of translations in real space so that momentum is conserved .",
    "in such a situation , the hfb mean - field ground state is a product state factoring in the single - particle momentum @xmath23 and is determined uniquely by its collection @xmath24 of spaces of quasi - particle annihilation operators .",
    "( an element of the complex vector space @xmath25 is an operator that annihilates a fermion in a state with momentum @xmath26 or is an operator that creates a fermion in a state of momentum @xmath27 or is any complex linear combination of these two types of operator . )",
    "the constant @xmath28 equals the sum of the number of conduction and valence bands of the fermion system .",
    "we assume that the hamiltonian has finite range in position space and is gapped , describing a band insulator or gapped superconductor .",
    "these assumptions ensure that the vector spaces @xmath25 depend continuously on the momentum @xmath26 and thus constitute a vector bundle , @xmath29 , over @xmath13 .",
    "the rank-@xmath6 complex vector bundles @xmath30 arising in this way come with some extra structure as formulated in ( [ eq : vb - conds ] ) .",
    "firstly , the condition @xmath31 on @xmath32-opposite fibers expresses the fundamental property of fermi statistics that all operators of a set of annihilation operators must have vanishing anti - commutators with one another .",
    "secondly , the hermitian orthogonality conditions in ( [ eq : vb - conds ] ) express the consequences of certain symmetries that constrain the hamiltonian of the gapped system and hence translate into symmetries of the ground state .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath33 there exist no symmetries ( other than translations ) . for @xmath34 ,",
    "the system has one anti - unitary symmetry , @xmath35 , namely the operation of time reversal .",
    "if @xmath36 denotes hermitian conjugation , which is a complex anti - linear operation exchanging creation and annihilation operators , then @xmath35-invariance of the quasi - particle vacuum is concisely expressed by the condition @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "we assume that our fermions have half - integer spin , so that @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "for @xmath41 , conservation of particle number enters as an additional , unitary symmetry .",
    "this is expressed by the operator @xmath42 for charge or particle number . if the hamiltonian commutes with @xmath42 , the quasi - particle vacuum is an eigenstate of @xmath42 . by conservation of momentum , this property can be expressed by the condition @xmath43 with @xmath44 . for @xmath45 , we add another anti - unitary symmetry , namely particle - hole conjugation @xmath46 , which leads to a third condition , @xmath47 .",
    "all operators @xmath48 are unitary and preserve the bracket @xmath12 encoding the canonical anti - commutation relations for fock operators .",
    "moreover , they obey the clifford algebra relations ( [ eq : cliff - s ] ) .",
    "to go beyond @xmath45 , we observe that four pseudo - symmetries @xmath49 have the same effect on @xmath25 as the quaternion algebra of @xmath50 spin - rotation symmetries , by a result known as @xmath51 periodicity ; see section [ sect : setting ] for the details .",
    "this should suffice for now to motivate the mathematical setting sketched in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cliff - s ] ) and ( [ eq : vb - conds ] ) .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to give a homotopy - theoretic classification of symmetry - protected topological phases of gapped free - fermion systems with symmetries as sketched above .",
    "the investigation of this classification problem was pioneered by schnyder , ryu , furusaki , and ludwig @xcite who observed that there exist , in every space dimension , 5 symmetry classes ( among the 10 classes of the `` tenfold way '' of disordered fermions @xcite ) that house topological insulators or superconductors robust to disorder .",
    "building on this observation , kitaev recognized the mathematical principle behind the emerging pattern , which he named the `` periodic table for topological insulators and superconductors '' @xcite .",
    "he understood that the constraints due to physical symmetries can be formulated as an extension problem for the clifford algebra ( [ eq : cliff - s ] ) of what we propose to call `` pseudo - symmetries '' , and he saw the close connection with a mathematical phenomenon known as bott periodicity .",
    "he also advocated @xmath0-theoretic methods as a tool to compute the topological invariants characterizing the different symmetry - protected topological ( spt ) phases .",
    "a pedagogical discussion of some points outlined by kitaev was offered by stone , chiu , and roy @xcite .",
    "symmetry aspects were elaborated by abramovici and kalugin @xcite .",
    "a remarkable extension of the bott - type periodicity phenomenon for free - fermion spt phases was proposed by teo and kane @xcite , who introduced position - like dimensions ( associated with defects ) in addition to the momentum - like dimensions considered in earlier work .",
    "freedman , hastings , nayak , qi , walker , and wang @xcite developed this idea further and pointed out that their results lead to a mathematical proof of kitaev s periodic table if one assumes ( with referral to unpublished notes by kitaev ) that gapped lattice hamiltonians are stably equivalent to dirac hamiltonians with a spatially varying mass term .",
    "fidkowski and kitaev @xcite gave a complete classification of one - dimensional systems including interactions .",
    "a recent treatise on the subject at large is by freed and moore @xcite , who set up a comprehensive framework based on the galilean group and review the relevant notions of twisted equivariant @xmath0-theory , an algebraic variant of which is treated in @xcite .",
    "let us now highlight the main differences between our work and the current literature .",
    "firstly , to the extent that only the static properties ( as opposed to the dynamical response ) of the physical system are under investigation , the classification problem at hand is a problem of classifying _ ground states _  that , in any case , is how we view it .",
    "thus we never make any direct reference to a hamiltonian .",
    "( aside from a locality condition to ensure the continuity of the vector bundle @xmath30 , the only information we need about the hamiltonian is its symmetry class , as this determines the symmetry class of the ground state . )",
    "in particular , there will be no need for any process of `` flattening '' the hamiltonian in this paper .    secondly , all our symmetries are _ true _ symmetries in the sense that they _ commute _ with the hamiltonian and leave the ground state invariant . `` symmetries '' that anti - commute with the hamiltonian ( such as chirality for the massless dirac operator ) do not appear in our work .",
    "thirdly , a crucial element of our approach is that we work over the complex number field throughout . as a matter of fact , the vector bundles singled out by the constraints ( [ eq : vb - conds ] ) are _ complex _ , i.e.  their fibers are complex vector spaces . while some of them can be regarded as real vector bundles in the sense of atiyah @xcite , others can not be .",
    "moreover , although the operator of hermitian conjugation does single out a real ( or majorana ) subspace @xmath52 , one of our discoveries is that one should keep this real structure flexible in order to attain the best overall perspective .",
    "( in fact , the formulation and proof of our results employs two different notions of taking the complex conjugate ! )    finally , and most importantly , our work differs from the work of other authors by the principle of topological classification used .",
    "starting with kitaev @xcite , most of the past and present literature has relied on the algebraic tools of @xmath0-theory to compute the topological invariants given by stable isomorphism classes of vector bundles .",
    "an exception is the approach in @xcite , where ordinary ( as opposed to stable ) isomorphism classes of vector bundles are computed for two of the ten symmetry classes .",
    "( these are the classes @xmath53i and @xmath53ii , which are special in that they permit a description of ground states by real and quaternionic vector bundles , respectively . in the present paper",
    "we will encounter vector bundles of a more general kind . ) in contradistinction , the present work uses homotopy - theoretic methods to establish a _ homotopy _",
    "classification for the classifying maps of the vector bundles @xmath30 .",
    "it has to be emphasized that the equivalence relation of homotopy is finer than that of ( ordinary or stable ) isomorphisms of vector bundles : ordinary isomorphism classes are recovered for a large number of valence bands , while stable isomorphism classes are recovered if both the valence and the conduction bands are large in number .      the following is a summary of the progress made in the present paper .",
    "our first result is a demonstration from first principles as to why the eight `` real '' symmetry classes of the tenfold way are to be put in the particular sequence featured by kitaev s periodic table . without invoking the after - the - fact reason of bott - type periodicity , we build up kitaev s sequence recursively by imposing true physical symmetries in a distinguished order . in this recursive process",
    ", each physical symmetry translates to a so - called pseudo - symmetry @xmath54 , which in turn gives rise to one of the @xmath2 conditions @xmath55 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vb - conds ] ) .",
    "our second result is an invariant and universal description of a map put forward by teo and kane @xcite , taking a ground state of ( symmetry ) class @xmath2 in @xmath1 dimensions and turning it into a ground state of class @xmath4 in @xmath56 dimensions . to state this more precisely ,",
    "let @xmath57 denote the classifying space for vector bundles of class @xmath2 with @xmath58 . for each @xmath2 , the bilinear form",
    "@xmath12 determines an involution @xmath59 that sends any @xmath60 to its annihilator @xmath61 given by @xmath62 . the first equation in ( [ eq : vb - conds ] ) is then restated as the condition @xmath63 , which can be interpreted as saying that the classifying map @xmath19 is equivariant with respect to a group @xmath64 whose non - trivial element acts on @xmath13 and @xmath57 by @xmath32 and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "now , following the original paper of bott @xcite we assign to every point @xmath53 of @xmath65 a minimal geodesic @xmath66 \\ni t \\mapsto \\beta_t(a)$ ] joining some distinguished point of @xmath67 to its antipode .",
    "the operation of forming the geodesic can be concatenated with the classifying map @xmath68 , and it preserves @xmath69-equivariance in the sense that @xmath70 .",
    "the final outcome of this invariant and universal construction is what we call the `` diagonal map '' , taking a vector bundle @xmath30 of class @xmath2 and transforming it into another vector bundle @xmath71 of class @xmath4 , where @xmath72 denotes the momentum - type suspension of @xmath13 .",
    "the diagonal map is , in a certain sense , a `` square root '' of the original bott map .",
    "indeed , a key step of our treatment is to take the square of the diagonal map and show that the outcome , properly understood , is the bott map .",
    "the diagonal map induces a mapping in homotopy  to be precise : a mapping between homotopy classes of base - point preserving and @xmath69-equivariant classifying maps ; or , in formulas : from @xmath73_\\ast^ { \\mathbb{z}_2}$ ] to @xmath74_\\ast^ { \\mathbb{z}_2}\\,$ ] ; or , physically speaking : between spt phases of gapped free fermions in adjacent symmetry classes and dimensions .",
    "our third and main achievement is a homotopy - theoretic proof that this map is bijective under favorable conditions .",
    "the precise statements are laid down in theorems [ thm:7.1 ] and [ thm:7.2 ] . to give a quick summary , let @xmath13 be a path - connected @xmath64-cw complex with base point @xmath75 fixed by the @xmath64-action , and let @xmath76 be a target - space base point also fixed by the @xmath64-action . then if @xmath77 there exist two bijections , @xmath78_\\ast^{\\mathbb{z}_2 } \\simeq [ m , c_s(n)]_\\ast^ { \\mathbb{z}_2 } \\simeq [ \\tilde{s } m , c_{s+1}(2n ) ] _ \\ast^ { \\mathbb{z}_2 } \\,,\\ ] ] between homotopy classes of base - point preserving and @xmath64-equivariant maps . the left one , where @xmath79 denotes the usual suspension ( which is position - type , i.e. , the space direction added in going from @xmath13 to @xmath79 is acted upon trivially by the extension of the involution @xmath32 ) , follows rather directly from the bott periodicity theorems , by employing the @xmath80-whitehead theorem for @xmath81 in order to transcribe these classical results to our setting .",
    "the right bijection is more difficult to establish . while a direct approach using",
    "morse theory might be feasible , our strategy of proof is to establish a connection with the classical bott isomorphism relating the stable homotopy groups of symmetric spaces .",
    "for this we first consider the special set of symmetry indices @xmath82 . in these cases",
    ", there exists a certain fibration that connects our diagonal map with the standard bott map ; thus , the right bijection in ( [ eq : main - result ] ) follows from the left bijection by an isomorphism due to the projection map @xmath83 of the fibration .",
    "( applying @xmath83 amounts to taking a square , which is the squaring operation alluded to earlier . ) sadly , for @xmath84 the said fibration is not available for finite @xmath6 , although it does exist in the @xmath0-theory limit of infinite @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we need to employ an additional argument to complete the proof .",
    "adapting an idea of teo and kane @xcite , we make use of generalized momentum spaces @xmath85 with position - like as well as momentum - like directions .",
    "we then use the left bijection in eq .",
    "( [ eq : main - result ] ) to dial the symmetry index @xmath2 to a value where the isomorphism by @xmath83 applies .",
    "the desired result now follows from @xmath86 .    if @xmath13 is a sphere carrying any @xmath64-action , the bijections in eq .",
    "( [ eq : main - result ] ) reproduce the result of @xcite , which in turn generalizes the periodic table presented in @xcite .    in the results stated above",
    ", we gave ourselves the luxury of making the simplifying assumption @xmath87 .",
    "our final result are practically useful bounds on @xmath1 ( as a function of @xmath6 ) delineating the region of validity of kitaev s periodic table and its generalization by teo and kane .",
    "the method of derivation used is stable inclusion of symmetric spaces .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sect : setting ] we set up the vector - bundle description of translation - invariant ground states of gapped free - fermion systems for all symmetry classes , starting with class @xmath33 ( no symmetries ; also known as class @xmath88 ) and increasing the number of ( pseudo-)symmetries up to @xmath89 . the passage from vector bundles to an equivalent description by classifying maps",
    "is made in section [ sect : classmaps ] .",
    "there we also give a number of examples illustrating the difference between the topological classification by homotopy classes of classifying maps , isomorphism classes of vector bundles , and the stable equivalence of @xmath0-theory . in section [",
    "sect : diag - map ] we formulate the diagonal map and illustrate it at the special example of making the steps from @xmath90 to @xmath51 and further to @xmath91 .",
    "the role of section [ sect:5 ] is to collect the results of homotopy theory relevant to our problem .",
    "we state the @xmath80-whitehead theorem and recall the classical bott periodicity theorem in the complex and real settings .",
    "we also exploit the property of @xmath64-equivariance to reformulate homotopy as relative homotopy . by using all this information , we prove in section [ sect:6 ] that the diagonal map induces a bijection in homotopy for the symmetry classes @xmath41 and @xmath92 . in section [ sect:7 ]",
    "we extend and complete the argument so as to cover all classes @xmath2 .",
    "the final section [ sect:8 ] presents the precise bounds on stability .",
    "we begin with some notation and language . a quasi - particle vacuum ( or free - fermion ground state , or hartree - fock - bogoliubov mean - field ground state ) is a state in fock space which is annihilated by a set of ( quasi-)particle annihilation operators .",
    "two well - known examples are hartree - fock ground states , which have a definite particle number , and the paired states of the bcs theory of superconductivity .    to give a precise description of such many - fermion ground states , we set out from the formalism of second quantization .",
    "we assume that our translation - invariant physical system ( with momentum space @xmath13 ) is built from a unit cell of hilbert space dimension @xmath6 .",
    "single - particle states are then characterized by their momentum @xmath17 and a band index @xmath93 . the single - particle creation and annihilation operators ( denoted by @xmath94 resp .",

    ", we are going to denote the operation of inverting the momentum by @xmath102 this is done in order to prepare the ground for a later modification of the involution @xmath32 .",
    "( in fact , we will eventually consider `` momentum '' spaces @xmath13 where some of the components of @xmath26 are _",
    "position_-like instead of momentum - like . ) in the present section , we always have @xmath103 , and we will take the liberty of frequently writing @xmath101 instead of @xmath104 for better clarity of the notation .    in terms of the basis @xmath105 ,",
    "the elements @xmath106 are expressed as @xmath107 with coefficients @xmath108 .",
    "the vector spaces @xmath97 are complex , and they all have the same dimension @xmath109 independent of @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , they are canonically isomorphic ( by unitary momentum - boost operators taken from the heisenberg group ) , and we often omit the momentum quantum number and write simply @xmath110 . the number @xmath6 is referred to as the ( total ) number of ( valence and conduction ) bands .",
    "one may think of the collection of vector spaces @xmath111 as a complex vector bundle , say @xmath112 , over the momentum space @xmath13 .",
    "this bundle is trivial in our setting : @xmath113 .",
    "it could , however , be non - trivial in a low - energy effective theory where the bands far from the fermi surface have been discarded . in any case , @xmath112 has non - trivial subvector bundles , and these are the objects of our interest .",
    "we now highlight some important structures on the vector spaces @xmath114 .",
    "first of all , the canonical anti - commutation relations ( car ) for fermionic fock operators induce for all @xmath17 a pairing between @xmath97 and @xmath115 , i.e.  a non - degenerate bilinear form @xmath116 by dropping the @xmath117-function @xmath118 in eq .",
    "( [ eq0:car ] ) .",
    "this pairing has the property of being symmetric for @xmath32-invariant momenta @xmath119 .",

    "( [ eq:2.3 ] ) we have @xmath122    next , fock space comes equipped with a hermitian scalar product , which determines an operation of hermitian conjugation . since hermitian conjugation in fock space takes operators that remove momentum @xmath26 into operators that create momentum @xmath26 , it induces a complex anti - linear involution @xmath123 for all @xmath17 . by combining this @xmath36-operation with the car pairing between @xmath124 and @xmath97 , we get a hermitian scalar product on each vector space @xmath97 : @xmath125 its expression in components is @xmath126    in summary , the set @xmath111 is a trivial bundle @xmath112 of canonically isomorphic hermitian vector spaces @xmath110 .",
    "it comes with the extra structure given by the pairing ( [ eq : car ] ) .",
    "we are now in a position to formalize the type of free - fermion or hartree - fock - bogoliubov mean - field ground state addressed in the present paper . in the following definition",
