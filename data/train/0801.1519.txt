    "the recent achievements of isolating and locating a single layer of graphene and performing transport measurements have tremendously stimulated the research on carbon - based electronics.@xcite by applying an external gate voltage , the system can be switched from @xmath0-type to @xmath1-type carriers , thus controlling the electronic properties and giving rise to carbon - based devices . at the crossover from @xmath0- to @xmath1-type carriers ,",
    "i.e. , at the charge neutrality point where no carriers are present , experiments nevertheless report a minimal finite , `` universal '' conductivity.@xcite    a first understanding of this result is already obtained from the band structure of the system . within a two - band tight - binding approach@xcite and in the long - wavelength limit",
    ", single - layer graphene is described by two - dimensional dirac fermions ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . at zero doping ,",
    "the density - of - states ( dos ) at the fermi energy is zero and the system is a zero - band gap semiconductor or semi - metal .",
    "graphene thus lies at the borderline of a semiconductor and a metal which gives rise to a number of new phenomena .",
    "e.g. , in contrast to the zero ( infinite ) conductivity for a clean semiconductor ( metal ) , the conductivity of a clean graphene sheet at zero temperature is finite and of order @xmath2 .    already ludwig et .",
    "al.@xcite pointed out that there are two possible prefactors to the conductance quantum @xmath2 .",
    "calculating , e.g. , the dc - conductivity via the kubo - formula using the polarizability for undoped graphene of ref .",
    "@xcite yields @xmath3 , where the dielectric constant @xmath4 is usually omitted ( @xmath5).@xcite introducing a finite scattering amplitude @xmath6 due to impurities and performing the limit @xmath7 in the end leads to @xmath8.@xcite    besides using the kubo formula , there were also calculations based on the landauer formula for a rectangular system with aspect ratio @xmath9.@xcite independent from the explicit boundary conditions , the conductivity was given by @xmath8 , corresponding to the physical limit procedure ( first @xmath10 and then @xmath7 ) in the case of the infinite system without contacts . in ref .",
    "@xcite , ryu et .",
    "thoroughly discuss the crossover between the two values depending on the different dc - limits . but taking the dc - limit after the integration over energies is performed , one obtains a third finite value for the minimal conductivity , i.e. , @xmath11 which is closest to the experimentally measured value given by @xmath12.@xcite    the above works are based on a ballistic transport model which predicts a universal conductivity .",
    "but mishchenko pointed out that electron - electron interaction may lead to a non - universal correction.@xcite also diffusive transport models can account for a minimal , but non - universal conductivity via midgap states,@xcite coulomb scatterers@xcite or electron - hole puddles.@xcite    this paper shall focus on the transport properties of clean graphene sheets at finite temperature and frequency . for an overview on ac conductivity in graphene",
    "the effect of temperature was also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite which can have two contrary effects as outlined below .",
    "on the one hand , one can see temperature as some effective finite chemical potential which would lead to an enhancement of the conductivity.@xcite this is suggested by the results by vafek on the plasmon dispersion for graphene at zero doping and at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "he finds that the collective plasmon excitations are only weakly damped even though they lie in the region where electron - hole excitations are allowed . in the case of finite doping and zero temperature ,",
    "electron - hole excitations are forbidden due to the pauli principle , thus leading to undamped plasmon excitations within the rpa approximation.@xcite    on the other hand , the finite conductivity at @xmath13 can be related to the spontaneous electron - hole creation at zero energy.@xcite these quantum fluctuations can be washed out at finite temperature , thus rendering the mechanism for finite conductivity for clean graphene to zero .",
    "it is this scenario which prevails and the dc - conductivity for graphene is indeed zero if the energy scale set by the carrier density is smaller than the temperature .    all calculations on the conductivity of clean graphene cited above are based on the long - wavelength approximation , i.e. , start from relativistic dirac fermions . here , we want to discuss the conductivity of a clean graphene sheet starting from the tight - binding model .",
    "we will further include finite temperature since the order of limits @xmath10 and then @xmath14 corresponds to the physical realization of an experiment .",
