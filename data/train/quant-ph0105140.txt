    "it is a common practice in the study of quantum systems to consider only a finite number of energy levels which are strongly coupled .",
    "the special case of truncation to two relevant levels is of enormous practical interest , and a vast amount of literature has been devoted to the dynamical properties of the two - level systems @xcite .",
    "the landau - zener tunneling between energy levels is a basic physical process @xcite , and has wide applications in various systems , such as current driven josephson junctions @xcite , atoms in accelerating optical lattices @xcite , and field - driven superlattices @xcite .",
    "a nonlinear two - level system may arise in a mean field treatment of a many - body system where the particles predominantly occupy two energy levels , where the level energies depend on the occupation of the levels due to the interactions between the particles .",
    "such a model arises in the study of the motion of a small polaron @xcite , for a bose - einstein condensate in a double - well potential @xcite or in an optical lattice @xcite , or for a small capacitance joseph - junction where the charging energy may be important .",
    "in contrast to the linear case , the dynamical property of a nonlinear two - level model is far from fully understood , and many novel features are revealed recently @xcite , including the discovery of a nonzero landau - zener tunneling probability even in the adiabatic limit when the nonlinear parameter exceeds a critical value .    in this paper , we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the nonlinear landau - zener tunneling , obtaining analytical results for the tunneling behavior in various regimes .",
    "this is made possible by the observation that the population difference and the relative phase of the two levels form a pair of canonically conjugate variables of a classical hamiltonian , the josephson hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "the fixed points of this classical system correspond to the eigenstates of the nonlinear two - level hamiltonian .",
    "adiabatic evolution of the fixed points as a function of level bias correspond to adiabatic evolution of the two eigenstates .",
    "the breakdown of adiabaticity occurs when a fixed point turns into a homoclinic orbit which is possible if and only if the nonlinear parameter exceeds a critical value .",
    "then the transition probability between the two energy levels can be nonzero even in the adiabatic limit , and is found to rise as a power law of the nonlinear parameter minus its critical value .",
    "right at the critical value of the nonlinear parameter , the transition probability goes to zero as a power law of the crossing rate of the two levels . below the critical point",
    ", the transition probability follows an exponential law as in the linear case but with the exponent changed due to the nonlinearity . far above the critical point",

    "our model system consists of two levels as in the standard zener model but with an additional energy difference depending on the population in the levels .",
    "it is described by the following hamiltonian matrix @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the probability amplitudes .",
    "the hamiltonian is characterized by three constants : the coupling between the two levels @xmath1 , the level bias @xmath8 as in the linear zener model , and the nonlinear parameter @xmath0 describing the level energy dependence on the populations .",
    "the amplitudes satisfy the schrdinger equation @xmath9 according to which , the total probability @xmath10 is conserved and is set to be @xmath11 .",
    "we wish to study how the system evolves when the level bias @xmath12 changes slowly from @xmath13 to @xmath14",
    ". it will be useful to find the adiabatic levels by diagonalizing the hamiltonian ( [ b ] ) , i.e. , solving the following eigen - equations with an eigenenergy @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 for a solution with nonzero amplitudes , we impose the determinental condition @xmath18 which leads to a quartic algebraic equation for the eigenenergy , @xmath19 the eigenenergies @xmath20 correspond to the real roots of the above quartic equation .",
    "it is readily found that this quartic equation has two real roots when @xmath21 , while there are four real roots when @xmath22 .",
    "two typical parameters are chosen to demonstrate the two cases in fig.1 . at @xmath23(fig.1a ) , there are two energy levels corresponding to the two real roots ; at @xmath24(fig.1b ) , a loop appears at the tip of the lower level in the regime @xmath25 , where eq .",

    "( [ rc ] ) in the following section .",
    "the eigenstates can be determined at the same time from the above equations , @xmath28 @xmath29 these eigenstates are not orthogonal to each other for finite @xmath30 , but become so in the limits of @xmath31 , where @xmath32 at @xmath33 and @xmath34 at @xmath35 . due to the nonlinearity of the model , there are two more eigenstates for @xmath22 and in the region @xmath36 .",
    "these correspond to the loop structure in the adiabatic energy levels shown in fig.1b .",
    "in this section , we cast the nonlinear two - level system into an effective classical system , i.e. the josephson hamiltonian .",
    "the dynamical mechanism for the breakdown of the adiabatic evolution will be revealed by investigating this classical hamiltonian system .",
    "the schrdinger equation ( [ a ] ) has the following explicit form @xmath37 @xmath38 which describes the evolution of the amplitudes for general occupations and phase of the wavefunctions .",
    "the physically interesting information of the state is completely represented by the population difference @xmath39 and the relative phase @xmath40 from eqs .",

    "since we are interested in the situation of a quasistatic level bias @xmath12 , it will be useful to find the fixed points of the classical dynamics when @xmath8 is fixed in time .",
    "the fixed points correspond to the eigenstates of the nonlinear two - level system , and are obtained by equating the right hand sides of eqs.([ceq1 ] ) and ( [ ceq2 ] ) to zero , yielding @xmath45 @xmath46 these can be consolidated into a single quartic equation @xmath47    the number of the fixed points depends on the nonlinear parameters @xmath0 . for weak nonlinearity , @xmath48 ,",
    "only two fixed points exist , denoted as @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the panels of fig.2 .",
    "these are elliptic fixed points corresponding to the maximum and minimum of the classical hamiltonian , and each are surrounded by closed ( elliptic ) orbits .",

    ", two more fixed points can appear when the level bias lies in a window @xmath36 .",
    "the boundary of the window can be obtained from the condition of real roots for quartic equations , yielding @xmath59 as shown in fig.3(c - e ) , both of the new fixed points lie on the line @xmath60 , one being elliptic ( @xmath61 ) as the original two and one being hyperbolic ( @xmath62 ) corresponding to a saddle point of the classical hamiltonian .",
    "one of the original fixed point , @xmath50 , still moves smoothly with @xmath30 , corresponding to the upper adiabatic level in fig.1(b ) .",
    "the other , @xmath49 , moves smoothly up to @xmath63 , where it collides with @xmath62 , corresponding to the branch @xmath64 of the lower level in fig.1(b ) .",
    "the new elliptic point @xmath61 , created at @xmath65 together with @xmath62 , moves up to the top , corresponding to the branch @xmath66 of the lower level .",
    "the hyperbolic point @xmath62 , moves down away from its partner after creation and is annihilated again with @xmath49 at @xmath67 , corresponding to the top branch @xmath68 of the lower level .",
    "the eventual fate of the fixed point @xmath49 will determine the adiabatic tunneling probability as shown below .",
    "for quasistatic change of the level bias @xmath30 , a closed orbit in the classical dynamics remains closed such that the action @xmath69 is invariant in time according to the classical adiabatic theorem @xcite , which is valid as long as the relative change of the system parameter in a period of the orbit is small , i.e. @xmath70 the action equals the phase space area enclosed by the closed orbit , and is zero for a fixed point which has no area . since the closed orbits surrounding an elliptic fixed point all have finite periods @xmath71 , they should evolve adiabatically with the area of each fixed in time .",
    "we thus expect an elliptic fixed point to remain as a fixed point during the quasistatic change of the system parameter . for the case of @xmath48 ,",
    "the two fixed points ( both elliptic ) evolve adiabatically throughout the entire course of change in the level bias , implying the absence of transition between the eigenstates in the adiabatic limit .",
    "this is still true for the fixed point @xmath72 in the case of @xmath58 , meaning a state starting from the upper level will remain in the upper level .",
    "the adiabatic condition is broken , however , when @xmath49 collides with the hyperbolic fixed point @xmath62 to form a homoclinic orbit where the period @xmath71 diverges .",
    "nevertheless , the classical particle will remain on this orbit , because the orbit is surrounded from both outside and inside by closed orbits of finite periods , which should form adiabatic barriers to prevent the particle from escaping .",
    "after this crisis , the homoclinic orbit turns into an ordinary closed orbit of finite period , and will evolve adiabatically for @xmath73 according to the rule of constant action which is now nonzero . in this region of the level bias ,",
    "the population difference oscillates along the orbit , which is just the feature described in ref.@xcite that `` there is a violent shaking above and about the lower branch of the adiabatic level after the terminal point '' .",
    "the adiabatic tunneling probability can then be calculated from the action @xmath74 of the homoclinic orbit .",
    "this orbit eventually evolves into a straight line at @xmath75 ( see fig.4 ) , where the condition of constant action demands that @xmath76 on the other hand , from the definition of population difference , we find the final probabilities to be given by @xmath77 the adiabatic tunneling probability is then expressed as @xmath78    the task we face then is to calculate the action of the homoclinic orbit .",
    "let @xmath79 be the population difference at the degenerate point @xmath80 where @xmath81 collides with @xmath62 when @xmath63 .",
    "it can be obtained by substituting the expression ( [ rc ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ fixed ] ) as @xmath82 considering the fact that the degenerate point @xmath80 lies on @xmath83 we find the total energy ( the value of the classical hamiltonian ) as @xmath84 the homoclinic orbit should have this energy , and its trajectory @xmath85 may be obtained by equating the classical hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) to @xmath86 .",
    "the corresponding action can then be evaluated to give the tunneling probability as @xmath87 this has been evaluated numerically , and the results compare extremely well with those obtained by directly integrating the time - dependent nonlinear schrdinger equation using the runge - kutta algorithm ( see fig.5 ) .",
    "the adiabatic tunneling probability can be evaluated analytically in the critical region of @xmath88 .",
    "the singular point of the level bias is found to leading order as @xmath89 the homoclinic orbit is confined near the critical point , with its top at @xmath90 we may expand the classical hamiltonian to leading orders of @xmath91 and @xmath92 to find @xmath93 from the area of this orbit the adiabatic tunneling probability for this limiting case is found to be given by the power law @xmath94    we may also obtain the adiabatic tunneling probability analytically in another limit , @xmath95 . to leading order in the small quantity @xmath96",
    ", we find @xmath97 @xmath98 in this case , the homoclinic orbit is confined near @xmath99 , and the deviation is the same order as @xmath100 . if we write @xmath101 , then @xmath102 by solving this equation and considering @xmath103 the adiabatic tunneling probability can be obtained @xmath104",
    "we have thus found that it is possible to tunnel between the adiabatic levels even in the adiabatic limit if the nonlinear parameter exceeds a critical value , i.e. , @xmath58 .",
    "we now consider the case of nonzero sweeping rates , and study how the nonliearity affects the nonadiabatic tunneling probability . in the linear case @xmath105",
    ", the landau - zener formula prescribes an exponential tunneling probability between the adiabatic levels , @xmath106 for the nonadiabatic case , we will focus our attention in this section to the critical point and the subcritical region , and consider the near adiabatic case ( i.e. , @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) .    for this purpose , we need to investigate the evolution of the fixed point @xmath81 as well as the nearby periodic orbits .",
    "then , in addition to the action variable @xmath109 mentioned in the above section , we should introduce its canonical conjugate  the angle variable @xmath110 .",

    "the integral comes from the neighborhood of the singularities of the integrand , which comes only from the zeros of the frequency @xmath131 .",

    "we first consider the case of critical nonlinearly , @xmath133 , for which the singular point occurs at @xmath134 .",
    "near this point , we find from eqs.([e63 ] ) that @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "then , we have an approximate relation @xmath137 near the singularity . substituting these expressions back to the eq.([e56 ] ) , and utilizing the fact that @xmath138 is independent of @xmath139 , we find a power - law behavior for the tunneling probability @xmath140 this scaling law has been verified by our numerical calculations ( fig.6 ) .",
    "now we extend our discussion to nonadiabatic tunneling for subcritical nonlinearity , where the zeros of the frequency @xmath141 are complex .",
    "because @xmath142 is a periodic function of the angle variable , it can be expanded as a fourier series , @xmath143 after substituting this series into eq.([e56 ] ) , we may deform the contour of integration into the complex plane . for those positive @xmath144 terms in the series",
    ", we may raise the contour into the upper half plane until it is  caught up  by a singularity of the integrand , namely a zero of @xmath145 .",
    "let @xmath146 be the singularity nearest to the real axis , i.e. the one with the smallest positive imaginary part .",
    "the principal contribution to the integral comes from the neighborhood of this point , yielding @xcite , @xmath147 where @xmath148 indicates the imaginary part of the complex number @xmath146 and @xmath149 is the lowest order of the fourier series whose fourier component does not vanish .",
    "the negative @xmath144 terms give the same exponential and so affects only the prefactor which we do not consider here . in the neighborhood of the elliptic fixed point @xmath49",
    ", the system can be approximated by a harmonic oscillation with the function @xmath150 , so we have @xmath151 .    to find the complex zero @xmath146",
    ", we combine the equations of ( [ e63 ] ) to express it as an integral of @xmath128 @xmath152 @xmath153 we take the upper bound to be the zero @xmath154 of the frequency , while the lower bound only reflects a certain choice of the origin of @xmath129 which does not affect the imaginary part .",
    "the tunneling probability is thus found to be proportional to the exponential @xmath155 where the factor in the exponent is given by @xmath156 for the linear case @xmath105 , the factor @xmath157 is exactly unit , which means that the expression of the tunneling probability is identical to the standard landau - zener formula . for the nonlinear case , @xmath158 , this factor becomes smaller than one , indicating the enhancement effect on the nonadiabatic tunneling .",
    "as @xmath159 goes up to 1 , the critical point , this factor vanishes , meaning the breakdown of the exponential law .    in fig.7 , we plot this factor and compare it with the results of numerical integration of the nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "the agreement is very well for the nearly linear case , @xmath160 , and there is some deviation when @xmath161 is close to unity .",
    "one reason for the latter is that the prefactor may be important in such a case .",
    "also , numerical accuracy may be blamed . to obtain the correct slope in the plot of @xmath162 vs. @xmath3",
    ", one should calculate the tunneling probability at infinitesimal @xmath3 .",

    "in an earlier section , we have found that for strong nonlinearity @xmath4 , there is a near unity tunneling probability to the upper adiabatic level even in the adiabatic limit .",
    "this probability can only gets larger when the sweeping rate is finite .",
