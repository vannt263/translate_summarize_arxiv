    "schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) is a family of random processes on conformal maps , which gives rise to a one - parameter family of measures on curves satisfying conformal invariance .",
    "it was first introduced in @xcite to describe the scaling limit of loop - erased random walks , but it was soon found to correspond to a large family of geometrical objects defined in the context of lattice models .",
    "the latter include interfaces in critical models  e.g. the interface between phases in the ising model or the boundary of the percolating cluster in critical percolation  and walk models , such as the self - avoiding walk in the scaling limit .",
    "a wealth of results have been obtained for sle in the _ chordal _ geometry , which involves curves starting and ending on points lying on the boundary of some connected domain , and in the _ radial _ geometry , where one of the points is on the boundary and the other is in the bulk .",
    "much less has been proved or checked in the whole - plane geometry , where both the starting and ending points lie in the bulk , such as the points @xmath1 and @xmath2 in @xmath3 .    in this paper",
    "we consider sle in the whole plane and compare it with the planar self - avoiding walks ( saw ) .",
    "the correspondence between the two models has been conjectured by lawler , schramm and werner in @xcite , on the basis of restriction covariance and conformal invariance . in particular",
    ", we will compare the scaling forms of the distribution functions in the two models .",
    "for this purpose , one has to be careful about which points along the curves have to be considered . on the sle side",
    ", a suitable parametrization must be chosen ; we will rely on parametrization by _ fractal variation _ , and will pick the point at a fixed value of this parametrization . on the saw side",
    ", we are going to consider an internal point deep inside the walk , so as to avoid finite - chain effects .",
    "thanks to the scaling relation between the fractal variation and the natural parametrization of sle , and to the fact that the discrete chains are sampled independently , this turns out to be a potentially efficient method for computing the distribution function of an internal point in the saw , since it produces independent samples of length @xmath4 in time @xmath5 with room for easy improvement .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : definitions ] we quickly review the relevant facts and definitions about schramm - loewner evolutions and self - avoiding walks ; in section [ sec : discrete ] we introduce and discuss the discrete process we will be simulating in the whole plane ; in section [ sec : distribution ] we define the distribution function and its conjectured scaling behavior ; in section [ sec : results ] we present our numerical results ; the appendix deals with the scaling of the average step length and the hull size in discrete sle .",
    "sle is a widely studied and reviewed subject , see e.g. @xcite for an introduction . here",
    "we will only recall the main ingredients , in order to make this paper as self - contained as possible .",
    "sle is a stochastic differential equation describing the evolution of a parametrized family of conformal maps @xmath6 in a domain @xmath7 .",
    "the actual form of the equation depends on the geometry , but in general it is written in terms of a function taking values on the boundary of @xmath7 , called _ driving function_. the driving function is rescaled brownian motion @xmath8 living on the boundary ; @xmath9 is a positive constant .",
    "the maps @xmath6 map some ( @xmath10-dependent ) subset of @xmath7 onto @xmath7 , so that one can define the growing _ hull _ @xmath11 as the domain of @xmath6 , i.e. the set of points for which the differential equation still has a solution up to time @xmath10 .",
    "the hull turns out to be _ generated _ by a curve @xmath12 , i.e. it is the union of the image of the curve with the interior of any loop it has closed .",
    "the curve  also called the _ trace _ of the process  is the pre - image of the driving function under @xmath6 : @xmath13 as the variance @xmath9 of the brownian driving function varies , the properties of @xmath12 change dramatically , and very different models have been proved or conjectured to be described by sle for some value of @xmath9 in the scaling limit .",
    "sle has proved a useful tool for addressing very diverse problems and questions ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "interesting issues arise when one considers the reparametrization of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the sle equation generates the hulls with a natural parametrization , which corresponds to a linearly growing _ capacity _ ( which is a property related to the expansion of @xmath6 around some special point and is a measure of the `` conformal size '' of the hull , see @xcite for a precise definition ) .",
    "as long as one is interested in parametrization - independent observables this is not an issue .",
    "but we will be considering the distribution function of the point @xmath12 for some fixed @xmath10 , so the choice of parametrization is clearly essential here .",
    "one way of dealing with this problem in the context of a numerical work is to generate the curves already with the correct parametrization  here _ correct _ means the one corresponding to the parametrization _ by length _ of the saw .",
    "the technical problem of producing discrete sle traces parametrized by length will be treated elsewhere . in this paper instead we will take advantage of a technique introduced by kennedy @xcite , which consists in defining a suitable notion of length along the discretized curve , and using it as the parametrization ( see section [ sec : discrete ] ) .",
    "a self - avoiding walk @xmath14 on the square lattice with a fixed number of steps @xmath15 is an ordered collection @xmath16 with @xmath17 , such that @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "the saw model is the uniform measure on these objects , i.e. on all non - intersecting @xmath15-step nearest - neighbor walks @xcite .",
    "a numerical check of the equivalence between the distribution functions of sle and saw in the _ half plane _ has been carried out in @xcite , with positive results .",
    "simulation of sle in the half plane @xmath21 is usually based on the discrete process introduced in @xcite , where it is also proved that it converges weakly to sle . here",
    "we introduce a whole - plane version of this discrete process .",
    "the idea ( see also @xcite ) is to write the loewner map as a composition of ( finitely many ) conformal maps , chosen from a simple parametrized family .",
    "time is partitioned by letting @xmath22 .",
    "the driving function is defined in such a way as to be equal to @xmath23 at the special times @xmath24 and constant in between .",
    "this amounts to approximating the brownian motion with a piecewise constant function , so that the incremental maps @xmath25 are obtained by solving the loewner equation with constant driving function up to time @xmath26 .",
    "let us denote @xmath27 .",
    "consider the radial sle equation @xmath28 which describes a hull starting from @xmath29 and growing towards the origin inside the unit disc @xmath30 .",
    "in analogy with the half - plane case , the hull @xmath11 at time @xmath10 is defined as the set of those points in @xmath30 for which the differential equation does not admit a solution that exists up to time @xmath10 . by composition with the complex inversion @xmath31",
    "one can define the map @xmath32 which now describes a hull growing in @xmath33 from @xmath34 to @xmath2 . the new map in ( [ eq : reciprocalmap ] ) happens to satisfy the same equation ( [ eq : radialsle ] ) , again with initial condition @xmath35 , but now with driving function @xmath36 , which has the same law as @xmath37 if started from @xmath38 .",
    "this process is called _ radial sle growing to infinity_. notice that @xmath6 does not describe a curve truly in the _ whole plane _ , since the unit disc is a forbidden region .",
    "however , we are going to focus on the large - scale regime in the following , and expect the cutoff at length scale @xmath39 to be irrelevant in this limit .",
    "the discrete process is based on the discretization of the evolution of the _ inverse _ map @xmath40 .",
    "this map _ grows _ the hull at time @xmath10 , i.e. it maps @xmath33 onto the complement of the hull in @xmath33",
    ". the atomic step of the discretization will be performed by a map  which we are going to call _ incremental _  that grows a _ slit _ ( a small radial segment ) out of the unit disc . obtaining",
    "this map is simply a matter of solving ( [ eq : radialsle ] ) in the special case when the driving function is constant , thus finding the loewner map corresponding to a straight line growing towards infinity ; the incremental map is its inverse .",
    "the result is be mapped to a point outside @xmath30 . the conformal map in ( [ eq : incrementalmap ] ) already appeared in the literature about diffusion limited aggregates @xcite , where it was used to represent the attachment of a single grain onto the cluster . ] @xmath41.\\ ] ] the greater the time @xmath10 is , the longer will be the line grown by @xmath42 . in the language of potential theory",
    ", one says that the hull grown by @xmath42 has _ logarithmic capacity _ @xmath10 .",
    "brownian motion driving the evolution lives on the boundary of the standard domain , which is the upper half plane in the chordal case , the unit disc in the radial case and the complement of @xmath30 in @xmath3 in the case at hand . notice that , by translation invariance , chordal sle in @xmath21 growing from @xmath43 to @xmath2 is chordal sle growing from @xmath1 to @xmath2 translated by @xmath43 , so that in simulating the discrete process one usually translates @xmath37 back to the origin after each iteration .",
    "translations are replaced by rotations in the radial case .",
    "therefore , at each step we will want to rotate @xmath44 back to @xmath39 .",
    "the whole discretized hull will be generated by alternately composing an incremental map with a rotation .",
    "let us call @xmath45 the logarithmic capacity of the incremental map at the @xmath46-th step ( i.e. the time at which the @xmath46-th map is evaluated ) , and correspondingly let @xmath47 denote the angle of the @xmath46-th rotation .",
    "the incremental map and the rotation themselves will then be denoted @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively , where @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath51 be the image of @xmath39 under the composed map at step @xmath46 @xmath52 notice that the order in which the maps are composed is the opposite as the usual one ; this is essentially a consequence of the fact that we are discretizing the inverse loewner map .",
    "the approximate curve we are interested in is embodied by the collection of points @xmath53 .",
    "refer to figure [ fig : composition ] .",
    ", the second corresponds to @xmath54 , and so on .",
    "the blue cross is the point @xmath39 , where the next slit will be based . ]",
    "the first map grows a slit based at point @xmath39 , which is then rotated to @xmath55 .",
    "the second map again grows a slit based at @xmath39 , so that the old slit will be sent away from the unit disc , and will be based somewhere between @xmath39 and the tip of the new slit ( notice that the old slit will not in general retain its rectilinear shape ) .",
    "then the whole hull is rotated by @xmath56 and another slit is grown . when the last composition with @xmath57 is reached , the @xmath46-th point on the trace is found .",
    "the process is repeated for each point @xmath51 that has to be computed .",
    "the resulting trace depends on the choice of the time - like parameters @xmath58 and the space - like parameters @xmath59 . in analogy with the chordal half - plane case @xcite we choose to draw each @xmath47 as a bernoulli variable in the set @xmath60 .",
    "this choice amounts to approximating the brownian motion with a piecewise constant function , the relation between @xmath45 and @xmath47 reproducing the well - known space - time scaling of brownian motion with variance @xmath9 .",
    "one has additional freedom in choosing the time intervals @xmath58 .",
    "changing the latter corresponds to a reparametrization of the resulting trace .",
    "the uniform partition @xmath61 yields the parametrization _ by capacity _ ,",
    "i.e. the natural sle parametrization where the hull increases its capacity linearly in time .",
    "the choice of parametrization is crucial for our purposes , since we are interested in the spatial distribution function , which is a parametrization - dependent observable . in order to reproduce the correct parametrization (",
    "that corresponding to the natural parametrization of the supposed scaling limit of self - avoiding walks ) we use the following method .",
    "first , we fix a scale @xmath62 . then , at each step , we compute the _ fractal variation _ of the curve as follows .",
    "let @xmath63 .",
    "times @xmath64 are defined recursively : given @xmath65 , @xmath66 is the first time after @xmath65 such that @xmath67 .",
    "the fractal variation at step @xmath46 is defined as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the largest integer such that @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is the fractal dimension of continuum sle as a function of @xmath9 @xcite @xmath72 the growth process will be stopped when @xmath73 reaches a fixed value @xmath74 .",
    "this procedure has the advantage of being independent of the original parametrization of @xmath75 .",
    "nonetheless , it is sensitive to discretization problems , for instance when the steps taken by the trace @xmath51 become too wide with respect to @xmath62 .",
    "a uniform partition @xmath61 causes the average step length at step @xmath46 , @xmath76 , to diverge as the number of steps @xmath46 grows ( the average is over all realizations of the process up to step @xmath46 ) . to avoid approximation problems we choose the time intervals @xmath45 in a non - uniform fashion ,",
    "having them scale as @xmath77 so as to compensate for the divergence of the average step length ( see the appendix for details ) .",
    "we can then define @xmath78 , at least for @xmath46 large enough .",
    "the discrete process is defined operatively as follows :    1 .",
    "fix the three scales @xmath79 , @xmath62 and @xmath74 ; start with @xmath80 2 .",
    "[ item1 ] choose @xmath45 according to ( [ eq : deltascaling ] ) 3 .",

    "measure the fractal variation ( [ eq : fractalvariation ] ) 6 .",
    "if @xmath81 stop , otherwise increase @xmath46 and return to [ item1 ] .",
    "notice that the time when the fractal variation reaches @xmath74 depends on the scale @xmath62 it is measured at , which should be sent to 0 in order to obtain the true fractal variation .",
    "of course , the curve obtained by means of the discrete process defined above is not really fractal at all , but it displays fractal properties only at a large enough scale .",
    "therefore , values of @xmath62 much less than the average step length are expected to yield the trivial parametrization . on the other hand when @xmath62 becomes comparable to @xmath82 , @xmath73 suffers from rounding problems .",
    "we will keep @xmath62 between these two cutoffs , and study how results depend on this choice .",
    "an example of the composed map after a few iteration is in figure [ fig : map ] .    ) after @xmath83 iterations .",
    "the curves are the images of circles and radii outside the unit disc . ]",

    "the probability distribution @xmath85 of this internal point ( the probability that it lies at site @xmath86 on the lattice ) has the following scaling form in the limit @xmath87 , @xmath88 , with @xmath89 fixed : @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 is the _ correlation length _",

    "since we want the distribution of a point a finite distance away from the origin in a truly infinite curve , we should take @xmath95 .",
    "let us then define the corresponding quantities for the sle approximated trace @xmath53 @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the number of points computed on the trace up to the stopping time when the fractal variation has reached @xmath74 .",
    "we are not considering the full distribution @xmath98 , since the discrete process as defined above explicitly breaks rotational invariance  it has @xmath39 as a special point .",

    "it is convenient to introduce an infrared cutoff @xmath109  i.e. a window for computing the moments  since deviations from scaling are more pronounced in the large-@xmath110 regime .",

    "we simulated an ensemble of @xmath118 self - avoiding walks of length @xmath119 using the pivot algorithm @xcite .",
    "we considered an internal point with @xmath120 ( detailed analysis of the systematic error due to the finiteness of @xmath121 shows that it is negligible when compared to the deviations in discrete - sle data due to the finiteness of @xmath62 and @xmath74 ) .",
    "the discrete sle process was simulated for several values of @xmath62 and @xmath74 , generating @xmath122 independent samples for each choice . in the following we are going to fix the average step size @xmath79 and",
