    "young low - mass stars form by accretion of material through a disk , a process accompanied by outflow activity .",
    "objects in their main accretion phase ( class 0 ) are usually associated with powerful outflows that manifest themselves in shock - excited @xmath2 emission .",
    "ngc  1333 is one of the youngest regions of clustered low - mass star formation and contains a relatively large population of class 0 sources @xcite and numerous outflows , as was pointed out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on a region of far - infrared and extended sub - millimeter emission in the southern part of the ngc  1333 star forming region that was first cataloged as iras  03256 + 3055 .",
    "we assume ngc  1333 to be at the same distance of 316 pc that @xcite determined for the ic 348 cluster located in the same per ob2 molecular cloud complex .",
    "@xcite discovered a system of herbig - haro objects associated with iras  03256 + 3055 , indicating outflow activity and thus recent star formation in the region . this paper reports new near - infrared images , spectroscopy , and polarimetry of the young stellar object ( yso ) responsible for this outflow activity .",
    "morphologically , the @xmath2 outflow associated with iras 03256 + 3055 is remarkable for its s - shaped symmetry .",
    "a number of possible explanations for deviations from a straight jet were discussed by @xcite .",
    "the changes in the iras  03256 + 3055 jet are smooth without discontinuities or kinks",
    ". jets with this morphology are usually interpreted as precessing .",
    "the precession of the accretion disk , and therefore of the jet , is caused by the misalignment of the disk plane and the orbital plane of a binary system .",
    "we also present new sub - millimeter images at 450@xmath3 m and 850@xmath3 m that confirm the results of @xcite and show a new compact sub - millimeter object .",
    "the s - shaped molecular hydrogen jet in the area of iras 03256 + 3055 was included in a wide field image of the ngc  1333 region in the h@xmath1 10 s(1 ) emission line obtained in the nights of july 30 to august 3 , 1996 using the quirc camera @xcite at the university of hawaii ( uh ) 2.2 m telescope .",
    "the individual integration time was 300 s. three frames were co - added at the position of the jet s driving source ( fig .  3 , 1996 image ) .",
    "a deep _ k_-band image of this region was subsequently obtained with quirc at the uh  2.2 m telescope , on the night of february 7 , 1998 ( ut ) .",
    "the individual integration time was 120 s per frame and a total of 30 frames were co - added to form the image shown in fig .  1 .    for proper motion studies , additional images in the h@xmath1 s(1 )",
    "line were obtained august 1 , 2004 with quirc at the uh 2.2 m telescope .",
    "these observations were carried out with an integration time of 60 s per frame and 56 such frames were co - added into the final image ( fig .  3 , 2004 image ) .",
    "the 1996 and 2004 h@xmath1 10 s(1 ) images of the jet do not show any detail beyond what is visible in the broad - band _ k_-band image in fig .  1 and are therefore not presented in their full extent in a figure",
    ". only the central areas of these images are shown in fig .",
    "the coordinates of the flux maximum in the _ k_-band near the apparent origin of the s - shaped jet were measured on a two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) image where this feature is very faintly visible : 03:28:45.3 + 31:05:42 ( j2000 ) . to distinguish this near - infrared object from the larger iras source",
    "we will refer to the near - infrared ( _ k_-band ) manifestation of the driving source of the s - shaped outflow as ngc1333 j032845.3 + 310542 ( k ) .",
    "higher spatial resolution near - infrared images of this central source of the outflow were obtained in the night of october 20 , 2003 with the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) using the ukirt fast track imager ( ufti ) @xcite .",
    "these _ j _ , _ h _ , and _ k _ images are shown as part of fig .  2 . the total integration time in the _ h _ and _ k _ bands was 18 minutes , while we integrated for a total of 36 minutes in the _ j _ band .",
    "the filter bandpasses are the mauna kea observatories standard filters as defined by @xcite .",
    "the infrared magnitudes of the bright knot of emission visible primarily in the _ h _ and _ k _ bands were measured using the iraf `` apphot '' package with an object aperture diameter of 2.2@xmath4 , and a very wide sky annulus to avoid the extended , mostly line emission from the rest of the nebula .",
    "calibration is based on the faint ukirt standard p247-u .",
    "the knot of continuum emission has the magnitudes _",
    "j_=19.9 ( 18@xmath3jy ) , _ h_=17.0 ( 165@xmath3jy ) , _ k_=14.9 ( 712@xmath3jy ) .",
    "_ k_-band imaging polarimetry was obtained with ufti and the irpol polarimetry module .",
    "irpol consists of a rotating halfwave retarder and , internal to ufti , a wollaston prism .",
    "a warm focal plane mask isolates two horizontal strips so the ordinary and extra - ordinary beams from each strip can be projected onto the array simultaneously .",
    "a measurement of the degree and angle of polarization takes a minimum of two halfwave plate settings . for our _ k_-band polarization value for this source ,",
    "72 individual exposures of 40 s integration time were used . due to the faintness of the object ,",
    "only an integral value for the polarization in an aperture of 2.2@xmath4 diameter centered on the flux maximum in the _ k _ band could be obtained .",
    "the polarization of this flux maximum is p = 10.4 % @xmath52 % at an angle of @xmath6 = 110@xmath7 @xmath5 5@xmath7 .",
    "the polarization vector is indicated in the _",
    "k_-band frame of fig .  2 .",
    "we also use optical images of the ngc  1333 star forming region at the wavelengths of h@xmath0 and [ sii ] as well as in the _ i _ band obtained on october 29 , 1997 by @xcite at the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) 4 m mayall telescope , and additional images using the same equipment , but better ccds , obtained by the same team on october 13 and 14 , 2001 .",
    "individual integration times were 400s and 600s for the narrow - band filters , and 60 s for the _ i_-band , and sets of 5 dithered exposures were combined into the final archival images .",
    "the images at the wavelength of h@xmath0 and [ sii ] are shown in fig . 1 for comparison with the",
    "_ k_-band image .",
    "the proper motion of the hh objects was measured by comparison of the 1997 and 2001 images and the resulting proper motion vectors are included in fig .  1 and listed in table 1 .",
    "the optical h@xmath0 and [ sii ] images in fig .",
    "1 were registered to the wide - field quirc _ k_-band image using the iraf tasks `` geomap '' and `` geotran '' on a set of 11 stars common to all images .",
    "the registration of the images has rms residuals of 0.1@xmath4 and is sufficiently precise to allow detailed discussion of the relative position of features at different wavelengths .",
    "this is particularly important since hardly any of the outflow features in the h@xmath0 and [ sii ] images coincide with features in the _ k _ band .",
    "the optical kpno images , the near - infrared wide - field quirc image , and the ukirt images in fig .",
    "2 were all astrometrically referenced to the same star near the driving source of the outflow , but outside of the field shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the coordinates of this star were measured on the 2mass image .",
    "two sets of h@xmath1 10 s(1 ) images taken 8 years apart were used to measure the proper motion of the eastern bow shock .",
    "the proper motion was measured by first registering the two images using the iraf tasks `` geomap '' and `` geotran '' on a set of field stars , and then measuring the proper motion of the bow shock and the motion of a control sample of stars using the task `` xregister '' .",
    "the small residual average displacement of the stars was treated as a residual alignment error between the two images and was subtracted from the bow shock proper motion .",
    "individual hh knots are better defined in h@xmath0 and [ sii ] than at infrared wavelengths .",
    "therefore the proper motions of the emission knots outside of the bow shock were measured by comparison of kpno mayall 4 m telescope prime focus images obtained in 1997 and 2001 , using the methods described in @xcite .",
    "the resulting proper motion vectors are shown in fig . 1 and are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "in contrast to the result obtained from h@xmath0 and [ sii ] emission , the h@xmath1 10 s(1 ) bow shock has a proper motion direction parallel to the jet axis .",
    "the difference between these measurements may be caused by the more complex morphology of the excitation in the h@xmath0 and [ sii ] lines where the emission appears composed of individual knots rather than a smooth bow shock .",
    "this point will be discussed in more detail in section 3.1 .",

    "this string of prominent knots is redshifted .",
    "the diffuse nebulosity at the position of the central source , detected in h@xmath0 and [ sii ] was called hh  340  a , while the brightest knot in the western outflow lobe was called hh  340  b. apparently , the relationship of these objects and the fact that hh  340  a is associated with the driving source of the outflow was not noted by @xcite .    in our infrared images , more extended flux is visible near the central source and it becomes clear that the hh knots 343 and 340 b form the two lobes of a s - shaped bipolar jet .",
    "figure 2 shows that the central driving source ngc1333 j032845.3 + 310542 ( k ) is close to but slightly to the north - east of hh  340  a as seen in h@xmath0 and [ sii ] .",
    "this diffuse h@xmath0 and [ sii ] emission seen near the position of the central source coincides with the south - western ( blueshifted ) lobe , as it is expected in a bipolar structure where the receding ( north - eastern ) lobe is more obscured by dust .",

    "the _ k_-band morphology of the jet is very different from that at the wavelengths of h@xmath0 and [ sii ] ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the h@xmath0 and [ sii ] lines trace much higher excitation levels than the h@xmath1 emission lines that dominate the emission in the _ k _ band .",
    "the h@xmath0 and [ sii ] images show well defined knots that led to the original naming hh  343  a - f , while on the _ k_-band image , the distinction between the individual knots is not discernable . rather , the molecular hydrogen emission consists of lines of enhanced emission that outline the outflow cavity .",
    "similarly , the western lobe shows two distinct knots in h@xmath0 and [ sii ] while the _ k_-band image shows a contiguous emission region that outlines an outflow cavity .",
    "the eastern jet ends in a typical bow shock .",
    "the images in h@xmath0 and [ sii ] show two maxima of flux , separated in an east - west direction , and connected by fainter extended flux .",
    "one maximum is located east ( ahead ) of the bow shock traced in the lower excitation _ k_-band image dominated by h@xmath1 lines , while the other maximum is behind the bow shock .",
    "this morphology matches the predictions of shock models .",
    "the highest excitations are found at the apex of the shock , and in the jet shock ( the mach disk ) .",
    "lower excitations are found in the bow shock wings formed by material flowing sideways away from the main shock region .",
    "other examples of this morphology have been discussed by @xcite .",
    "the diffuse emission in the western jet near the central source coincides with a ridge of sub - millimeter emission ( fig . 5 , lower panel ) .",
    "the position of the optical knots hh 340 b and the corresponding h@xmath1 emission coincides with the edge of sub - millimeter clump b. this does not prove , but suggests that the western jet interacts with molecular clump b , and may play a role in triggering future star formation there .",
    "the proper motion vectors are consistent with a curved jet for the system of herbig - haro knots in hh  343 and hh  340 . approximating the jet by an arc of a circle and dividing by the proper motion of the bow shock in the near - infrared , a kinematic age of the jet of @xmath106000 years",
    "is obtained , which represents a lower limit to the true age of the jet .",
    "the projected jet axis has precessed by almost 90@xmath7 in this time interval .",
    "the more extended bow shock hh  350 @xcite lies to the south of the tip of hh  343  a , and is seen in h@xmath0 and [ sii ] , but is not detected in the _ k _ band .",
    "both its large size and lack of infrared emission suggest that it is not driven by the same source as hh  343 and 340 .",
    "rather , hh  350 is more likely part of the extended larger system of shock fronts possibly originating from iras  2 and containing hh  350 , hh  14 , and hh  351 @xcite .    while a number of effects can cause an outflow to deviate from a straight line @xcite , a jet with s - shaped morphology and smooth curvature without discontinuities or kinks is most likely the result of a precessing driving source .",
    "precessing jets have been discussed by @xcite , and @xcite in the context of disks in binary systems that are misaligned with the orbital plane .",
    "@xcite conclude that , typically , the disk will be forced into alignment with the orbital plane in approximately one precession period , which in turn is an order of magnitude longer ( by about a factor of 20 ) than the binary orbital period .",
    "this view is supported by the fact that , to date , no precessing jets with multiple turns have been observed .",
    "the object discussed here is no exception . from the central driving source to the main bow shock ,",
    "presumably the end of the jet , it has precessed by about one quarter turn .",
    "the kinematic age of @xmath106000  years provides an estimate for the jet s age under the assumption that this bow shock is the surface of first interaction with previously undisturbed molecular cloud material .",
    "the lack of any indication of other shock fronts farther away from the driving source makes this a plausible assumption .",
    "having observed roughly a quarter turn of the jet in @xmath106000  years gives an estimate of the precession period of 24000  years , and therefore an estimate of the disk alignment time of the order of 2@xmath1110@xmath12  years , i. e. , of order of the main accretion time on the protostar .",
    "following @xcite a binary period of the order of @xmath101000  years is implied , corresponding to a binary separation of @xmath10100  au for a total mass of @xmath101 m@xmath13 of the two components , a reasonable upper limit given the overall faintness of this source .",
    "for any plausible total mass , the binary orbit major axis is of the order of the size of our own solar system . at the distance of 316 pc assumed here for ngc  1333 , this corresponds to angular separations of the order of 0.1to 0.3 .",
    "direct detection of the two components in the sub - millimeter requires better spatial resolution than provided by existing interferometers .",

    "the broad flux minimum that separates the north - eastern and south - western lobe is most pronounced in the _ j _ and _ h _ bands , but is less visible in the _ k _ band . this is the typical appearance of a bipolar nebula where direct radiation from the central star is blocked by an extended , possibly flared disk seen close to edge - on .",

    "while we do not have spectra of the object at wavelengths other than the _ k _ band , we suspect that most of the flux seen in the extended nebula at shorter wavelengths is also line emission .",
    "it is therefore likely that the driving source of the outflow is located within the knot of continuum emission at 03:28:45.3 + 31:05:42 ( j2000 ) that dominates the _ k_-band image .",

    "additional far - infrared fluxes of iras 03256 + 3055 have been measured by @xcite from iras co - added scans .",
    "he reports fluxes of 0.02 jy at 12 @xmath3 m , 0.15 jy at 25 @xmath3 m , 1.6 jy at 60 @xmath3 m , and 6 jy at 100 @xmath3 m .",
    "the position of the iras source is consistent with the flux distribution seen in the sub - millimeter maps , i. e. , the iras flux is not concentrated on the near - infrared source . at the resolution of the iras data",
    "no extension of the object is detectable . these additional data , showing some mid - ir flux from the object , point toward a slightly more advanced state of evolution than class 0 .",
    "however , the iras data combine the flux from ngc1333 j032845.3 + 310542 ( k ) with the other near - infrared source ngc1333 j032834.5 + 310705 ( k ) , that will be discussed below in section 4 .",
    "this source is most likely a class i source and may have contaminated the low resolution iras data with mid - infrared flux .",
    "the near - infrared spectrum of ngc1333 j032845.3 + 310542 ( k ) closely resembles that of an object of sed class i. therefore , since class 0 and i sources in nearby star forming regions are readily detectable at sub - millimeter wavelength , we conclude that ngc1333 j032845.3 + 310542 ( k ) is the counterpart of the extended clump d of sub - millimeter emission , and not just a chance superposition . the well - defined h@xmath1 jet with a young kinematic age and the very low bolometric temperature point to possibly an even earlier evolutionary state .",
    "the low total luminosity of this region indicates a very low mass star or multiple system at the center of the outflow .",
    "the precession of the jet is best explained by a binary system with at least one accretion disk . with the caveat that better data , in particular higher spatial resolution fir data , are needed to firm up this conclusion",
    ", we suggest that ngc1333 j032845.3 + 310542 ( k ) is a low mass binary system of protostars in or near the end of their main accretion activity phase .    based on their sub - millimeter observations of the central part of ngc  1333",
    "@xcite and @xcite concluded that secondary star formation in ngc  1333 is triggered in dense shells of gas swept up by a previous generation of outflows .",
    "the powerful outflows associated with the well known class 0 and i sources iras 1 - 9 in ngc  1333 @xcite , all located @xmath10 1 pc north of the iras 03256 + 3055 group , may have collectively triggered the formation of these dense molecular clumps .",
    "ngc1333 j032845.3 + 310542 ( k ) is the first ( binary ) protostar in iras 03256 + 3055 to reach the class 0 outflow stage , where it develops a jet readily detectable in the optical and near infrared .",
    "the jet from ngc1333 j032845.3 + 310542 ( k ) appears to impinge on molecular clump b ( fig .  5 ) , suggesting this may be the next step in jet - induced triggered star formation in this region .",
    "the iras 03256 + 3055 group of molecular clumps is not unique . in their extensive studies of the molecular cores in the @xmath14 ophiuchus",
    "cloud , @xcite find that most cores contain typically of order 10 dense molecular clumps .",
    "the typical linear extent of cores , and the projected separation of the individual clumps , are similar to that found in the iras 03256 + 3055 group . due to the proximity of @xmath14 ophiuchus ( about half the distance of ngc  1333 ) and better resolution of their data ,",
    "they are able to identify a larger number of individual clumps in each core .",
    "they also find that in the core oph - a , star formation appears to have progressed from the outside in , presumably in response to an external trigger .",
    "similarly the cluster of protostellar sources in serpens nw was studied by @xcite .",
    "they identify 7 continuum millimeter emission sources in an area of roughly 0.2 pc extent , some of which are associated with outflow sources and therefore are protostars , and some that are probably pre - stellar .",
    "on our sub - millimeter maps , we found a compact , fairly bright sub - millimeter source west of the extended emission ( labeled a in fig . 5 ) .",
    "this source was not included in the field recorded by @xcite .",
    "the compact component of this source has a flux of 650 mjy at 450@xmath3 m and 274 mjy at 850@xmath3 m , measured by comparing the peak flux in the map to maps of the calibration standard crl618 .",
    "the compact source is surrounded by extended emission that is mostly visible at 450 @xmath3 m , while it is not clearly distinguishable from the psf at 850@xmath3 m .",
    "when integrating the extended emission by sky - subtracted aperture photometry , the net flux ( as listed in table 2 ) is 756 mjy at 450@xmath3 m and 271 mjy at 850@xmath3 m .",
    "the sub - millimeter source coincides with a faint , slightly extended source on our _ k_-band image ( fig . 5 , bottom panel ) at position 03:28:34.5 + 31:07:05 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the source , which we will refer to as ngc1333 j032834.5 + 310705 ( k ) is also faintly visible on the 2mass _ k_-band image .",
    "it can be seen in our s(1 ) image , albeit significantly fainter , indicating a very red color .",
    "it is invisible on the optical ccd images by @xcite and their later ccd data .",
    "ngc1333 j032834.5 + 310705 ( k ) has a cometary morphology , with the apex of the conical shape pointing to the east .",
    "on the basis of the strong compact sub - millimeter flux , and its near - infrared detectability and morphology we tentatively identify this source as a class i object .",
    "it can not be determined if this object is physically close to the iras 03256 + 3055 group of sub - millimeter clumps or whether it is farther away along the line of sight .",
    "we have presented optical and near - infrared images of the system of herbig - haro objects 340 b , 343 a - f , and their driving source , ngc1333 j032845.3 + 310542 ( k ) in ngc  1333 .",
    "the herbig - haro objects and the h@xmath1 emission seen in the _ k _ band outline a jet of centro - symmetric s - shaped morphology , suggesting a precessing driving source . at wavelengths shorter than 2.2@xmath3",
    "m , the central driving source is dominated by line emission from the south - western part of the jet , which is moving toward the observer . in the _",
    "k_-band , the flux is dominated by continuum radiation , polarized and therefore partly scattered , from the central source . the spectrum of this source is a steep continuum with some br@xmath9 emission , characteristic of a class i source .",
    "the sed of the region based on sub - millimeter and iras data , suggests an evolutionary state of class 0 or i. the sub - millimeter maps at 450 and 850 @xmath3 m confirm the existence of a region of extended emission , probably a cluster of pre - stellar clumps .",
    "clump d associated with the near - infrared object ngc1333 j032845.3 + 310542 ( k ) is probably the first in this cluster to begin forming a star .",
