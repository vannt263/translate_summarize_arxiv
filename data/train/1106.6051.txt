    "the forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetry in top - quark pair production in proton - antiproton collisions is an observable which originates from the difference in the production rates for top quarks in the forward and backward hemispheres @xcite .",
    "the total fb asymmetry was measured by the cdf and d0 collaborations at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "the measurement can be carried out in the laboratory frame ( @xmath2 frame ) as well as in the center - of - mass frame of the top - quark pair ( @xmath3 frame ) .",
    "the asymmetries in the two frames are defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of events , @xmath6 indicates the laboratory frame ( @xmath3 frame ) , and @xmath7 is the top - quark rapidity in frame @xmath8 .",
    "the measurements obtained by the cdf collaboration using 5.3  fb@xmath9 of data are @xcite @xmath10 the quoted uncertainties are derived from a combination of statistical and systematic errors .",
    "the production of top - quark pairs at hadron colliders is dominated by qcd . at the tevatron",
    ", the charge conjugation invariance of the strong interaction implies that the difference in the production of top quarks in the forward and backward hemispheres is equivalent to the difference in the production of top and antitop quarks in the forward hemisphere .",
    "therefore , in qcd the fb asymmetry is equivalent to the charge asymmetry .",
    "qcd predicts a non - vanishing contribution to the fb asymmetry starting at order @xmath11 in the squared amplitude .",
    "a contribution to the asymmetry arises if , in the interference of one - loop and tree - level diagrams , the top - quark fermionic line and the light - quark fermionic line are connected by three gluons @xcite .",
    "the same is true in the case of the interference of two tree - level diagrams with three particles in the final state .",
    "the dominant effect is from the quark - antiquark annihilation channel , while a further , numerically small contribution to the asymmetry at order @xmath11 originates from the flavor excitation channel @xmath12 , where @xmath13 indicates additional partons in the final state .",
    "the gluon fusion channel does not contribute to the fb asymmetry at any order in perturbation theory , due to the fact that the gluon distribution is the same for protons and antiprotons .",
    "the total fb asymmetry predicted by qcd at the first non - vanishing order ( which , for reasons discussed later in this paper , we will indicate as next - to - leading order ( nlo ) ) is lower than the one measured at the tevatron .",
    "two recent evaluations using the formulas in @xcite report the following values @xcite , obtained using mstw2008 nlo parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) @xcite , @xmath14 the central values quoted in ( [ eq : nlo ] ) refer to the choice @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the factorization scale and @xmath17 the top - quark mass , which is set to @xmath18  gev .",
    "the errors originate from the scale variation in the range @xmath19 .",
    "these choices will also be adopted in the rest of the paper .",
    "electroweak corrections enhance the prediction for the asymmetry by less than 10% of the central value @xcite , and to separate uncertainties coming from electroweak calculations we do not include these corrections in our numerical results . as one can see , the discrepancy between the theory prediction and the experimental measurement in the @xmath2 frame is less than two standard deviations ( 2@xmath20 ) , while in the @xmath3 frame the two values agree within @xmath21 , although the central value of the experimental measurement is a bit higher .    in @xcite , the cdf collaboration measured the fb asymmetry in the @xmath3 frame as a function of the top - pair invariant mass @xmath22 .",
    "after grouping the events in two bins corresponding to @xmath23  gev and @xmath24  gev , they found the asymmetry in the latter bin to be @xmath25 which is more than 3@xmath20 higher than the stated theoretical nlo prediction in @xcite of @xmath26 obtained using the mcfm program  @xcite .",
    "a measurement of the fb asymmetry in two bins of the rapidity difference @xmath27 was also performed and again in that case the higher bin shows a tension with the nlo qcd prediction , although with larger experimental errors .",
    "many attempts to explain these results in terms of new physics scenarios have been made , see e.g.   @xcite .",
    "the task is complicated by the fact that the new physics contributions should not spoil the good agreement between theory and measurements for the total pair - production cross section and the differential distribution in the pair invariant mass .",
    "recently , we have calculated the top - pair invariant - mass distribution and the top - quark rapidity and transverse - momentum distributions in renormalization - group ( rg ) improved perturbation theory , which incorporates the resummation of logarithmic corrections that become numerically large in the limit of soft - gluon emission @xcite .",
    "these calculations were carried out at next - to - next - to - leading - logarithmic ( nnll ) accuracy .",
    "the resummed distributions were then matched to the nlo results to obtain predictions which have nlo+nnll accuracy .",
    "alternatively , the resummed results at nnll order can be employed to generate approximate next - to - next - to leading ( nnlo ) predictions @xcite .",
    "we note that working at approximate nnlo accuracy does not alter in a fundamental way any of the results obtained within the nlo+nnll framework . on the other hand , we believe that in certain kinematic regions , for instance at large pair invariant mass",
    ", resummation is important .",
    "for these reasons , and for the sake of simplicity , in the following we focus on nlo+nnll calculations . by integrating the differential distributions",
    "it is then straightforward to calculate the top - quark fb asymmetry both in the laboratory frame and in the @xmath3 frame .",
    "starting from the double differential cross section in the pair invariant mass and scattering angle , we can also compute the @xmath22 and rapidity - dependent asymmetries , which can be compared to experimental measurements .",
    "the main goal of this letter is to present the result of these calculations of the total and differential fb asymmetries in a systematic way .    at the large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    ", the symmetry of the @xmath28 initial state dictates that the rapidity distributions of the top and antitop quarks are symmetric and that the fb asymmetry vanishes .",
    "however , it was observed in @xcite that at the lhc top quarks are preferably produced at larger rapidities than antitop quarks in the laboratory frame . like the fb asymmetry at the tevatron ,",
    "this rapidity - dependent charge asymmetry is generated at order @xmath11 in the squared amplitude , mainly through the asymmetric part of the quark - antiquark annihilation channel .",
    "therefore , potential new physics contributions would effect these two quantities in a correlated way , and the higher collider energy at the lhc gives it better access to distortions at higher rapidities . as a final application of our formalism ,",
    "we evaluate at nlo+nnll order the partially integrated charge asymmetry at the lhc , giving results as a function of a lower cut - off on the top and antitop rapidities in the laboratory frame .",
    "the fb asymmetry in the laboratory frame can be calculated starting from the top - pair production cross section differential with respect to the top - quark transverse momentum @xmath29 and rapidity @xmath30 .",
    "to do so , it is convenient to first define a total and differential asymmetric cross section via @xmath31    \\nonumber    \\\\    & \\equiv \\int_0^{y^+_t } dy_t \\left [ \\left ( \\frac{d\\sigma}{dy_t } \\right)_f - \\left (        \\frac{d\\sigma}{dy_t } \\right)_b \\right]\\equiv \\int_0^{y^+_t } dy_t   \\frac{d \\delta\\sigma^{p\\bar{p}}_{\\text{fb}}}{dy_t } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the square of the hadronic center - of - mass energy . to obtain the fb asymmetry in the laboratory frame one needs to calculate the ratio of the asymmetric cross section in ( [ eq : fbasympp ] ) to the total cross section : @xmath34    in our phenomenological analysis we will consider two levels of perturbative precision for the asymmetric cross section and fb asymmetry .",
    "the first involves the differential cross section at nlo in fixed - order perturbation theory , the second the nlo calculation supplemented with soft - gluon resummation to nnll order . in the laboratory frame , the resummed calculations are carried out using the @xmath35 scheme introduced in @xcite .",
    "such predictions resum a class of logarithms which become large in the limit where @xmath36 is small ( @xmath37 indicates the momentum of the antitop quark , and @xmath38 the total momentum of additional partons in the final state ) , in which case real gluon emission is soft although the top pair is not produced at rest . while the phase - space integrals in ( [ eq : fbasympp ] ) are in general sensitive to regions where @xmath39 is not small , the threshold region is dynamically enhanced due to the sharp fall - off of the pdfs away from small values of @xmath39 .",
    "in fact , it was shown in @xcite that the leading terms in the @xmath35 threshold limit reproduce essentially the entire nlo correction to the differential cross section in the quark channel , which implies that resumming the corrections which become large in this limit is an improvement on the fixed - order calculation .",
    "while in the fixed - order counting the asymmetric cross section first arises from the nlo calculation of the differential cross section , in the resummed counting it first appears at nll order .",
    "the nlo+nnll calculation is thus a refinement on the leading term , and will be considered our best prediction .    before illustrating our results for the fb asymmetry",
    ", we need to clarify an important point concerning our convention for counting orders in the perturbative expansion .",
    "we calculate @xmath40 itself as a perturbative expansion in @xmath41 , using a fixed - order or logarithmic counting as appropriate . for example , the first non - vanishing contribution to the asymmetry in fixed - order perturbation theory is obtained by calculating the numerator in ( [ eq : fbaa ] ) to order @xmath11 and the denominator to order @xmath42 .",
    "the resulting asymmetry is of order @xmath41 , which we will refer to as nlo , with reference to the order at which the differential distributions in ( [ eq : fbasympp ] ) are calculated relative to @xmath42 .",
    "similarly , in rg - improved perturbation theory , the first non - vanishing contribution to @xmath40 is obtained by calculating both the numerator and the denominator at next - to - leading - logarithmic ( nll ) order ; the resulting asymmetry is then counted as nll .",
    "this convention was already adopted in @xcite .",
    "there are two counting schemes in the literature ( in fixed - order perturbation theory ) which are different from ours .",
    "the first one also treats @xmath40 itself as a perturbative expansion , but counts the order @xmath41 contribution as lo , and so on , as in @xcite .",
    "the second one treats the numerator and the denominator as separate perturbative series and does not further expand the ratio , as adopted in the quoted mcfm results in @xcite .",
    "we note that while the first scheme differs from ours only by name , the second scheme leads to different numerical results .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the nlo+nnll results are considerably more stable with respect to the choice of scheme than the nlo results .",
    ".[tab : ppbar ] the asymmetric cross section and fb asymmetry in the @xmath2 frame .",
    "the first error refers to perturbative uncertainties estimated through scale variations as explained in the text , and the second error in the mstw2008 case is the pdf uncertainty . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in this section we study the simplest realization of a charge asymmetry at the lhc , namely the rapidity - dependent quantity in the laboratory ( @xmath28 ) frame . in particular , we focus on the partially integrated charge asymmetry and charge - asymmetric cross section , where we impose the restriction @xmath43 on the differential cross section .",
    "we define these through @xmath44 with @xmath45 as in ( [ eq : yplimits ] ) .",
    "we can study the partially integrated charge asymmetry and asymmetric cross section ( [ eq : lhcasym ] ) at nlo and nlo+nnll order using the results for the differential cross section in 1pi kinematics obtained in @xcite .",
    "the results generated with mstw2008 pdfs are shown in figure  [ fig : lhcasym ] , where the bands reflect uncertainties related to scale variations carried out with the same procedure as at the tevatron . for the charge - asymmetric cross section shown in the left - hand panel of the figure , the main effect of the resummation is to decrease the scale dependence of the result to a relatively small region of the nlo error band .",
    "for the partially integrated asymmetry shown in the right - hand panel of the figure , the resummation is a mild effect up to @xmath46 , but substantially reduces the asymmetry at higher values of the cut .",
    "however , due to large k factors in the gluon channel at the lhc , the uncertainty band for the nlo curve is very sensitive to whether one consistently expands the asymmetry ratio in ( [ eq : lhcasym ] ) .",
    "if we had deviated from our normal procedure and had not expanded the ratio , instead evaluating the denominator at nlo order , the nlo band would actually overlap quite well with the nlo+nnll results shown in figure .",
    "the nlo+nnll result is largely insensitive to this change of systematics  the result where both the numerator and denominator are evaluated at",
    "nlo+nnll order is within the error band shown in the figure .",
    "the partially integrated charge asymmetry vanishes for @xmath47 , and becomes progressively larger at higher values of the cut .",
    "however , the charge asymmetric cross section shown in the left - hand side of the figure is very small at higher rapidity values and the experimental measurement is difficult .",
    "a reasonable way to compare theory and experiment in this case would be to perform a measurement in a high - rapidity bin with @xmath48 .",
    "in such a bin the standard model charge asymmetry is predicted to be only slightly different from zero , less than 2% depending on the exact choice of the cut , so any appreciable charge asymmetry in an experimental measurement would be a clear sign of a new physics contribution to the high - rapidity region of the distribution , which is already hinted at by the tevatron measurements .    note that other partially integrated differential distributions can be used to study the phase - space dependence of the charge asymmetry .",
    "for instance , one can consider the so - called central charge asymmetry introduced in @xcite , which imposes a cut @xmath49 along with a restriction to relatively high pair invariant mass in order to reduce the contribution from the @xmath50 channel to the symmetric part of the partially integrated cross section .",
    "unfortunately , it is beyond the scope of the paper to perform an nlo+nnll analysis for such an observable , because it requires a combination of pim and 1pi kinematics which is not possible to derive starting directly from the results of @xcite .",
    "the total top - quark fb asymmetry measured at the tevatron is not in good agreement with the predictions obtained at the first non - vanishing order in perturbative qcd .",
    "the tension between theory and experiment is about two standard deviations for the asymmetry measurement in the laboratory frame , and approximately 1@xmath20 in the top - pair rest frame .",
    "moreover , the measurement of the asymmetry in the large pair invariant - mass region ( @xmath24  gev ) by the cdf collaboration @xcite differs from the leading - order prediction in qcd by more that three standard deviations , and there is also a discrepancy between theory and experiment for the fb asymmetry at values of the top - pair rapidity difference @xmath51 .",
    "the calculations of the double differential distribution for the top - quark pair production in two different kinematic schemes , carried out in @xcite , allow us to evaluate the fb asymmetry in both the laboratory frame and in the top - pair rest frame .",
    "the predictions obtained in this way include the full nlo corrections to the total and asymmetric cross sections , whose ratio determines the fb asymmetry , as well as the resummation of soft - gluon emission effects up to nnll accuracy .",
    "such nlo+nnll results represent the most accurate determination of the qcd contribution to the asymmetry that can be obtained to date .",
    "studies of the nlo results indicated that power corrections to our results obtained in the soft limit within the effective theory approach are small , due to the mechanism of dynamical threshold enhancement .",
    "the full nnlo calculation would be very useful in quantifying this at the next order in perturbation theory , but we do not expect such power corrections to change our predictions in any significant way .",
    "tables  [ tab : ppbar ] and [ tab : ttbar ] show that the numerical impact of the nnll corrections on the total asymmetry is modest , less than @xmath52 of the central value in all cases considered .",
    "it must be observed that while the total and asymmetric cross sections calculated at nlo+nnll order have smaller scale uncertainties than the corresponding quantities calculated at nlo , the same is not always true for the fb asymmetry , indicating that the errors at nlo are affected by accidental cancellations and do not reflect the true perturbative uncertainties .",
    "after the inclusion of the nnll corrections , the predicted values of the asymmetry remain lower than the measured ones by @xmath53 in the @xmath54 frame and @xmath55 in the @xmath56 frame .",
    "we have also shown that pdf uncertainties are much reduced for the fb asymmetries compared to those for the asymmetric or total cross sections .",
    "for instance , the total asymmetry calculated with mstw2008 pdfs differs from the one obtained from cteq6.6 or nnpdf2.1 pdfs by only a few percent .",
    "the nlo+nnll calculation of the asymmetry in the high invariant - mass bin @xmath57  gev increases the nlo prediction only by a very small amount , about 3% of the central value .",
    "the perturbative and pdf uncertainties of the calculation are much smaller than the experimental errors .",
    "hence , if the tevatron measurement of the fb asymmetry in the high invariant - mass bin is confirmed as the experimental error is reduced , it will become a compelling signal for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "given the situation at the tevatron , it is well motivated to measure observables sensitive to the top quark asymmetry also at the lhc .",
    "since the fb asymmetry vanishes at the lhc , one of the possible choices consists in measuring the charge asymmetry partially integrated in a given rapidity region .",
    "starting from the nlo+nnll resummed rapidity distributions for the top and antitop quarks , we calculated the charge asymmetry as a function of a lower rapidity cut in the laboratory frame . a careful choice of the lower bound on the rapidity integration region can allow one to use this observable to test for the presence of new physics in the top - quark sector at the lhc , thus providing complementary information to the tevatron measurements .    _ acknowledgments : _ we would like to thank rikkert frederix for providing us a private version of madfks .",
