    "the bllacertae object ao0235@xmath0164  is one of the most intensively monitored and variable blazars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "very rapid changes in its flux density have been reported across the entire electromagnetic spectrum , from radio frequencies @xcite to gamma - ray energies @xcite .    at optical wavelengths , rapid variations of a few tenths of a magnitude within a single night",
    "have been repeatedly detected @xcite .",
    "@xcite found the most extreme variability event ever reported for this object : changes up to 0.5 mag in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands were detected within a single night , whereas night - to - night variations reached up to 1.2 mag .",
    "the historical optical light - curve of ao0235@xmath0164  has been compiled by @xcite , while several international follow - up campaigns have provided detailed multiwavelength monitoring for this object @xcite .",
    "those data suggested the existence of a @xmath3yr quasi - periodical behaviour , then leading to an interpretation in terms of a binary supermassive black hole system at the core of the source @xcite .",
    "recent multifrequency observations by @xcite , however , have suggested a longer ( @xmath4yr ) periodicity .",
    "on the other hand , since the optical emission in blazars is expected to be dominated by synchrotron radiation from the relativistic jet , optical polarimetry is a useful tool to probe the innermost regions of these objects , especially when high time - resolution data are obtained @xcite . in spite of this fact , polarimetric observations of blazars are still scarce , and",
    "the first attempts to characterise the polarimetric micro - variability of different blazar classes have just recently been done @xcite . in the particular case of ao0235@xmath0164 ,",
    "previous studies revealed high degrees of optical polarization ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , with inter - night random fluctuations @xcite , but nothing was known about its polarimetric behaviour on very short time - scales .    in this letter",
    "we present the first insight into the polarimetric micro - variability of ao0235@xmath0164 .",
    "our high - temporal resolution data show significant variations both in the linear polarization degree and the position angle at intra - night as well as at inter - night time - scales .",
    "simultaneous differential photometry ( at the @xmath5 and @xmath1 bands ) shows that no apparent correlation exists between variations in polarized and total flux .",
    "however , there is a clear trend in the sense that the ( @xmath6 ) colour gets redder ( i.e. , the spectrum gets softer ) when the polarization degree is higher .",
    "we present our observational data in section  [ s_obsred ] , we give the photometric and polarimetric variability results in section  [ s_resu ] , and we close with a short discussion and our conclusions in section  [ s_discu ] .",
    "we observed ao0235@xmath0164  along 6 nights in november 2005 and two additional nights in december 2005 , using the calar alto faint object spectrograph ( cafos ) in its imaging polarimetry mode , at the calar alto ( spain ) 2.2 m telescope . in this instrumental setup , a polarizer unit , consisting of a wollaston prism plus a rotatable half - wave plate ,",
    "is inserted into the light beam , thus producing two orthogonally polarized images of each object on the focal plane , separated by 18.9 arcsec .",
    "the detector was a site#1d ccd , with @xmath7 m pixels , a gain of 2.3 electrons adu@xmath8 , and a read - out noise of 5.06 electrons .    in order to avoid any possible overlapping of the ordinary ( o ) image of one object with the extraordinary ( e ) image of a different object ,",
    "a mask with alternate blind and clear stripes is placed before the detector .",
    "hence , each polarimetric frame consists of alternate o and e @xmath9 arcsec wide stripes .",
    "this procedure also enhances the s / n ratio by reducing the sky contribution to half its otherwise value , although , as a drawback , half of the field of view is lost .",
    "four frames , each taken with a different position of the half - wave plate ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) are needed to obtain the normalised stokes parameters ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) for linear polarization .",
    "the relevant expressions for @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be found in , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite . from them , the degree of linear polarization and its corresponding position angle are calculated in the usual way : @xmath16 @xmath17    on the other hand , by adding the fluxes corresponding to the o and e images of the same object within each frame , photometric data are also obtained .",
    "this allowed us to simultaneously study both the photometric and the polarimetric behaviours of our target with time .",
    "hence , our observational program consisted of unit blocks with the following form :    * four consecutive frames , with the polarizer unit in , with half - wave plate angles @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , respectively , all obtained trough an @xmath1 ( cousins ) filter . from these we obtained one polarimetric data point and 4 photometric , @xmath1-band , data points . * one @xmath5 frame , without the polarizer unit",
    "this gave us a photometric @xmath5-band data point .",
    "a sequence of @xmath18 such 5 frames blocks was obtained for ao0235@xmath0164  each night , with @xmath19 , depending on the observing conditions .",
    "this procedure gave us @xmath18 polarimetric ( @xmath1-band ) data points , @xmath18 photometric @xmath5 data points , and @xmath20 photometric @xmath1 data points per night .",
    "the exception is the night of nov/0304 , 2005 , when just two photometric @xmath1 data could be obtained , due to bad weather .",
    "individual integration times ranged from 360 to 450s for @xmath5 , and between 240 and 360s for @xmath1 ( all 4 @xmath1-band frames within a given polarimetric block were obtained with identical exposure times ) . several standard highly - polarized and unpolarized stars from @xcite",
    "were also observed ( at least two polarimetric cycles each ) for calibration purposes .",
    "atmospheric conditions were dissimilar along the whole observing time , ranging from high - quality photometric nights to rather mediocre conditions due to poor seeing and/or passing cirrus .",
    "however , given that both polarimetry and differential photometry are robust against poor observing conditions , these had no systematic impact on our data , except for a loose in s / n ratio .",
    "we shall further discuss this below ( see section  [ s_resu ] ) .",

    "all science frames were bias - corrected using a master bias prepared from 30 individual bias frames , and flat - fielded using twilight sky flats .",
    "standard routines within the iraf package were used for image processing and all subsequent data extraction .",
    "we obtained the instrumental magnitudes corresponding to both the o and e images of ao0235@xmath0164  on each frame , using the aperture photometry task apphot .",
    "the same was done for 9 stars evenly distributed on the field and suitably placed within the mask stripes ( i.e. , we rejected stars close to the edge of a stripe ) .",
    "these stars were used to evaluate the instrumental / foreground polarization , while two of them were used to construct the differential photometry light - curves ( see section  [ s_resu ] ) .",
    "all the measured objects in the field are shown in fig .",
    "[ f_field ] ; for each object , red and blue circles mark the o and e images , respectively .",
    "our target ( ao0235@xmath0164 ) as well as the two stars used for differential photometry ( see section  [ ss_phot ] ) are labelled .",
    "a 3 arcsec radius aperture was always used .",
    "blazars photo - polarimetry can be affected by spurious variations due to the host galaxy @xcite , but this should not be relevant for ao0235@xmath0164 given its relatively high redshift ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "however , a possible error source is an agn lying @xmath22 arcsec south of ao0235@xmath0164  ( named elisa in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which we resolve on our best - seeing images , but appears merged with our target on the rest .",
    "we checked for any spurious effect on the photo - polarimetric variability of ao0235@xmath0164  by comparing data obtained through different apertures against each other . except for a change in s / n ratio",
    ", there was no significant difference .",
    "we also checked for any correlation between photo - polarimetric variability and changes in the seeing full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) , finding none .",
    "hence , we conclude that no systematic errors due to this nearby object significantly affect our variability results . however , constant shifts are expected in total and polarized flux due to elisa and a faint absorbing galaxy @xmath23 east from ao0235@xmath0164  ( g1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , respectively .",
    "we shall return to this point in section  [ s_resu ] .",
    "a local sky value was measured , as usual , within an annulus surrounding each aperture . since both o and e images of the same source are close ( @xmath24arcsec ) to each other on the polarimetric frames , all pixels corresponding to the e image ( including sky ) were masked out when measuring the o image , and vice - versa .",
    "the differential light - curve for ao0235@xmath0164  was obtained in the usual way , using a non - variable star ( here named star  2 ) in the field as comparison ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while another star ( 3 ) was used to construct a second differential light - curve against star  2 , to be used for control purposes ( see fig .",
    "[ f_field ] ) .",

    "note the stability of the control light - curves ( lower panels ) .",
    "the statistical significances of intra - night variations were assessed following @xcite , i.e.  defining a scaled confidence parameter @xmath25 which depends on the dispersions of both light - curves ( target  comparison and control  comparison ) and on a corrective factor that equalises their respective instrumental errors ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for the @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 nights we have well - sampled light - curves displaying significant intra - night variability .",
    "we get a formally very high value of @xmath25 for the @xmath30 night , although with only two data points in @xmath1 . despite this poor sampling due to bad weather",
    ", these data follow the inter - night trend : ao0235@xmath0164  brightened by @xmath31mag from the @xmath27 to the @xmath32 nights . during the last night in november and both december nights , ao0235@xmath0164displayed no significant intra - night variability .",
    "we also calculated @xmath1 and @xmath5 magnitudes for ao0235@xmath0164  in the standard system .",
    "to do so , we used photometry of field stars from our own previous data ( star 2 : @xmath33 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and from the literature @xcite .",
    "during our observations , ao0235@xmath0164  ranged between @xmath34 mag ; i.e. , it was at a state of moderate brightness as compared to its historical light - curve , and about 2 mag fainter than during its major outbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xmath6 colour - indices were calculated by interpolating @xmath1 and @xmath5 magnitudes to common time instants .",
    "we verified that subtracting the flux contribution from elisa and correcting for galactic plus foreground absortion does not change our micro - variability results in any significant way , except for nearly constant shifts in the light curves ( @xmath35 and @xmath36mag brighter in @xmath1 and @xmath5 , respectively ) .",
    "however , colour index is significantly affected .",
    "we thus obtained a corrected colour index @xmath37 following @xcite , and we transformed it to spectral index @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , using @xmath40 , @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "we obtained the linear polarization percentage ( @xmath42 ) and position angle ( @xmath43 ) for ao0235@xmath0164  using equations  ( [ e_pol ] ) and ( [ e_theta ] ) , as outlined in section  [ s_obsred ] .",
    "the contribution from instrumental polarization was derived from data on unpolarized standard stars , while foreground polarization was estimated from star 2 , which lies at @xmath44arcsec from ao0235@xmath0164 .",
    "foreground polarization is small ( @xmath45 ) , in agreement with the low galactic extinction towards ao0235@xmath0164 .",
    "we also checked for any dependence of instrumental polarization with position on the ccd .",
    "stars near the border of the field tend to display relatively large @xmath42 values ; however , since ao0235@xmath0164  was always centrally placed on the field , no systematic effect is expected on our polarimetric curves .",
    "the position angle was transformed to the equatorial system using data from highly polarized standard stars .",

    "[ f_poltheta ] shows the behaviour of @xmath42 and @xmath43 along the whole campaign .",
    "the degree of polarization was high ( @xmath46 ) and clearly variable , both at intra- and inter - night time - scales .",
    "the position angle was also variable , although no clear connection between the behaviours of both parameters can be seen .",
    "in fact , some of the nights ao0235@xmath0164  displayed conspicuous variability in @xmath42 without any significant change in @xmath43 , while the converse is also true .",
    "the significance of @xmath42 and @xmath43 variability for ao0235@xmath0164  can be assessed by comparing it with the behaviour of these same parameters for field stars .",
    "we found that the dispersions of the @xmath42 and @xmath43 curves against time for the stars strongly depend on their magnitudes , as expected since in this case any variability should be due to errors . from these relations , we estimated the dispersions in polarization degree and position angle for ao0235@xmath0164 , expected just from errors , to be @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "as a result , 5 out of 7 nights with polarimetric data available show statistically significant ( @xmath49 ) microvariability in @xmath42 , while just two of them show significant microvariability in @xmath43 .",
    "note that intra - night variability amplitudes up to @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) were detected .",

    "the behaviour of ao0235@xmath0164  on the stokes plane is shown in fig .",
    "note the different location of the dec/2005 data ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) as compared to those at the beginning of our campaign , despite their similar @xmath42 values .",
    "this underscores that there is no correlation between @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "neither there is any correlation between @xmath42 and the source brightness or the variability gradient of the observed flux .",
    "a well - defined correlation appears to exist , instead , between @xmath42 and the corrected colour index @xmath37 ( or spectral index @xmath38 ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f_polcol ] , @xmath42 tended to be lower when the spectrum was harder , although the relation displays a significant scatter .",
    "@xcite suggest a two - component origin for the optical emission of ao0235@xmath0164 , given that its colour index vs.  magnitude relation seems to show two different behaviours , depending on the overall flux level of the source .",
    "previous micro - variability data @xcite have suggested , although with a low confidence level , a mean trend in the sense that the optical emission of ao0235@xmath0164  became brighter when its spectrum was harder .",
    "our present data span rather limited ranges both in magnitude and colour index [ @xmath57mag ; @xmath58mag ] , so this may be the reason why we did not detect any definite trend between colour index and magnitude . in any case , our data fall at the low - luminosity end of the relation shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig .",
    "7 ) , which displays a redder - when - fainter behaviour .",
    "the relatively large scatter of this relation would thus be intrinsic , since micro - variations usually do not follow the general trend .    as mentioned in the previous section",
    ", we did not detect any clear correlation between polarization degree and total flux .",
    "this lack of correlation seems to be a common feature of microvariability in blazars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , a well - defined relation between polarization degree and spectral index does show up from our data ( fig .",
    "[ f_polcol ] ) .",
    "note that this relation is in the opposite sense as expected if the decrease in polarization degree were due to a higher relative contribution from the ( redder , unpolarized ) host galaxy light .",
    "the spectral index ranged from 1.91 to 2.38 , and we obtained the following linear relation against polarization degree : @xmath59 this relation is in qualitatively good agreement with those found for 3c66a @xcite and oj287 @xcite , suggesting that , despite the different time - scales involved in those studies , a similar mechanism could be operating in all three objects .",
    "@xcite propose that the polarization degree decreases when the ratio between the strength of the regular and the chaotic components of the magnetic field decreases due to blobs moving along the jet , thus breaking up the ordered structure of the field .",
    "the higher degree of disorder in the magnetic field also leads to a hardening of the spectrum .",
    "alternatively , @xcite suggested that the frequency dependency of the polarization can be interpreted in terms of an inhomogeneous model , with two components contributing to the optical emission .",
    "one is a polarized component with a high - energy cut - off that could be identified with the radiation produced by shock accelerated electrons in the compressed magnetic field lines .",
    "the other component would have a steeper spectral index and slight polarization and could correspond to the underlying jet emission .",
    "changes in the cut - off , due to variable energy losses , would lead to a harder spectrum ( lower @xmath38 ) when the unpolarized component dominates the optical emission .",
    "@xcite have recently presented observational support for an additional component , in the form of a uv  soft x - ray bump , lying between the synchrotron and inverse compton peaks in the spectral energy distruibution of ao0235@xmath0164 .",
    "they suggest this extra component may arise from a thermal accretion disk or from a distinct region in an inhomogeneous jet . in either case ,",
    "changes in @xmath42 , spectral index and total flux are expected .    in the present letter",
    "we have reported the existence of extremely rapid variability in the optical flux and , for the first time , in the optical polarization of the blazar ao0235@xmath0164 .",
    "there is no correlation between the variability of both parameters , but a clear correlation is observed between the spectral index and the polarization , in the sense that the polarization is lower when the spectrum is harder .",
    "such a behaviour might be the effect of shocks moving through the inner jet of the source .",
    "these shocks could be formed by collisions of relativistic plasma outflows with different velocities .",
    "alternatively , a two - component model , particularly if the uv  soft x - ray bump has a thermal origin , could naturally lead to correlated variability in polarization and spectral index .",
    "long - term polarization observations could reveal whether this phenomenology is present on other timescales , yielding then useful information to further constrain the different models .",
