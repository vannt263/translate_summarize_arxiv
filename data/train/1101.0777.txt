    "the willmore energy of an immersed compact oriented surface @xmath2 with boundary @xmath3 is defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mean curvature vector on @xmath6 , @xmath7 the geodesic curvature on @xmath3 , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 the induced area and length metrics on @xmath6 , @xmath3 . the willmore energy of surfaces with or without boundary plays an important role in geometry , elastic membranes theory , strings theory , and image processing . among the many concrete optimization problems where the willmore functional appears ,",
    "let us mention for instance the modeling of biological membranes , the design of glasses , and the smoothing of meshed surfaces in computer graphics .",
    "the willmore energy is the subject of a long - standing research not only due to its relevance to some physical situations but also due to its fundamental property of being conformal invariant , which makes it an interesting substitute to the area functional in conformal geometry .",
    "critical points of @xmath10 with respect to interior variations are called willmore surfaces .",
    "they are solutions of the euler - lagrange equation @xmath11 whose expression is particularly simple when @xmath12 : @xmath13 , being @xmath14 the gauss curvature .",
    "it is known since blaschke and thomsen  @xcite that stereographic projections of compact minimal surfaces in @xmath15 are always willmore surfaces in @xmath16 . however , pinkall exhibited in  @xcite an infinite series of compact embedded willmore surfaces that are not stereographic projections of compact embedded minimal surfaces in @xmath17 .",
    "yet kusner conjectured  @xcite that stereographic projections of lawson s @xmath18-holed tori in @xmath17 should be global minimizers of @xmath19 among all genus @xmath18 surfaces .",
    "this conjecture is still open , except of course for the case @xmath20 where the round sphere is known to be the unique global minimizer .",
    "the existence of smooth surfaces that minimize the willmore energy spanning a given boundary and a conormal field has been proved by schtzle in  @xcite . following the notations in  @xcite , we consider a smooth embedded closed oriented curve @xmath21 together with a smooth unit normal field @xmath22 and we denote as @xmath23 and @xmath24 their possible orientations .",
    "we assume that there exist oriented extensions of @xmath25 , @xmath24 , that is , there are compact oriented surfaces @xmath26 with boundary @xmath27 and conormal vector field @xmath28 on @xmath29 .",
    "we also assume that there exists a bounded open set @xmath30 such that the set @xmath31 is not empty . the condition on energy ensures that @xmath32 is an embedding .",
    "it follows from  @xcite , corollary 1.2 , that the willmore boundary problem associated with @xmath33 in @xmath34 has a solution , i.e. , there exists a compact , oriented , connected , smooth surface @xmath35 with @xmath36 , @xmath37 on @xmath3 , and @xmath38    there have been many contributions to the numerical simulation of willmore surfaces in space dimension @xmath12 . among them , hsu , kusner and sullivan have tested experimentally in  @xcite the validity of kusner s conjecture : starting from a triangulated polyhedron in @xmath16 that is close to a lawson s surface of genus @xmath18 , they let it evolve by a discrete willmore flow using brakke s surface evolver  @xcite and check that the solution obtained after convergence is @xmath19-stable .",
    "recent updates that brakke brought to its program give now the possibility to test the flow with various discrete definitions of the mean curvature .",
    "mayer and simonett  @xcite introduce a finite difference scheme to approximate axisymmetric solutions of the willmore flow .",
    "rusu  @xcite and clarenz et al .",
    "@xcite use a finite elements approximation of the flow to compute the evolution of surfaces with or without boundary . in both works ,",
    "position and mean curvature vector are taken as independent variables , which is also the case of the contribution by verdera et al .",
    "@xcite , where a triangulated surface with a hole in it is restored using the following approach : by the coarea formula , the willmore energy ( actually a generalization to other curvature exponents ) is replaced with the energy of an implicit and smooth representation of the surface , and the mean curvature term is replaced by the divergence of an unknown field that aims to represent the normal field .",
    "droske and rumpf  @xcite propose a finite element approach to the willmore flow but replace the standard flow equation by its level set formulation .",
    "the contribution of dziuk  @xcite is twofold : it provides a finite element approximation to the willmore flow with or without boundary conditions that can handle as well embedded or immersed surfaces ( turning the surface problem into a quasi - planar problem ) , and a consistency result showing the convergence of both the discrete surface and the discrete willmore energy to the continuous surface and its energy when the approximated surface has enough regularity .",
    "bobenko and schrder  @xcite use a difference strategy : they introduce a discrete notion of mean curvature for triangulated surfaces computed from the circles circumscribed to each triangle that shares with the continuous definition a few properties , in particular the invariance with respect to the full mbius group in @xmath16 .",
    "this discrete definition is vertex - based and a discrete flow can be derived .",
    "based also on several axiomatic constraints but using a finite elements framework , wardetzky et al .",
    "@xcite introduce an edge - based discrete willmore energy for triangulated surfaces .",
    "olischlger and rumpf  @xcite introduce a two step time discretization of the willmore flow that extends to the willmore case , at least formally , the discrete time approximation of the mean curvature motion due to almgren , taylor , and wang  @xcite , and luckhaus and sturzenhecker  @xcite . the strategy consists in using the mean curvature flow to compute an approximation of the mean curvature and plug it in a time discrete approximation of the willmore flow .",
    "grzibovskis and heintz  @xcite , and esedoglu et al .",
    "@xcite discuss how 4th order flows can be approximated by iterative convolution with suitable kernels and thresholding .",
    "while all the previous approaches yield approximations of critical points of the willmore energy , our motivation in this paper is to approximate global minimizers of the energy .",
    "this is an obviously nontrivial task due to the high nonlinearity and nonconvexity of the energy . yet , for the simpler area functional , sullivan  @xcite has shown with a calibration argument that the task of finding minimal surfaces can be turned into a linear problem .",
    "even more , when a discrete solution is seeked among surfaces that are union of faces in a cubic grid partition of @xmath16 , he proved that the minimization of the linear program is equivalent to solving a minimum - cost circulation network flow problem , for which efficient codes have been developed by boykov and kolmogorov  @xcite after ford and fulkerson  @xcite .",
    "sullivan  @xcite did not provide experiments in his paper but this was done recently by grady  @xcite , with applications to the segmentation of medical images .",
    "the linear formulation that we propose here is based on two key ideas : the concept of surface continuation constraints that has been pioneered by sullivan  @xcite and grady  @xcite , and the representation of a triangular surface using pairs of triangles . with this representation and a suitable definition of discrete mean curvature ,",
    "we are able to turn into a linear formulation the task of minimizing discrete representations of any functional of the form @xmath39 among discrete immersed surfaces with boundary constraints : @xmath40 in the expression of @xmath41 , @xmath42 denotes the space variable , @xmath43 the normal vector field on @xmath6 and @xmath5 the mean curvature vector .",
    "the linear problem we obtain involves integer - valued unknowns and does not seem to admit any simple graph - based equivalent .",
    "we will therefore discuss whether classical strategies for linear optimization can be used .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec:1 ] we discuss both the chosen representation of surfaces and the definition of discrete mean curvature . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we present a first possible approach yielding a quadratic energy .",
    "we present in section  [ sec:3 ] our linear formulation and discuss whether it can be tackled by classical linear optimization techniques .",
    "the equivalence shown by sullivan between finding minimal surfaces and solving a flow problem holds true for discrete surfaces defined as a connected set of cell faces in a cellular complex discrete representation of the space .",
    "we will consider here polyhedral surfaces defined as union of triangles with vertices in ( a finite subset of ) the cubic lattice @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the resolution scale .",
    "not all possible triangles are allowed but only those respecting a specified limit on the maximal edge length .",
    "we assume that each triangle , as well as each triangle edge , is represented twice , once for each orientation .",
    "we let @xmath46 denote the collection of oriented triangles , @xmath47 its cardinality , and @xmath48 the number of oriented triangle edges .",
    "the constrained boundary is given as a contiguous oriented set of triangle edges .",
    "the orientation of the boundary constrains the spanning surfaces since we will allow only spanning triangles whose orientation is compatible .    in this framework",
    ", one can represent a triangular mesh as a binary indicator vector @xmath49 where @xmath50 means that the respective triangle is present in the mesh , @xmath51 that it is not .",
    "obviously , not all binary indicator vectors can be associated with a triangular surface since the corresponding triangles may not be contiguous . however , as discussed by grady  @xcite and , in a slightly different setting , by sullivan  @xcite , it is possible to write in a linear form the constraint that only binary vectors that correspond to surfaces spanning the given boundary are considered .",
    "we will see that using the same approach here turns the initial boundary value problem into a quadratic program .",
    "another formulation will be necessary to get a linear problem .      to define the set of admissible indicator vectors , we first consider a relationship between oriented triangles and oriented edges which is called _ incidence _",
    ": a triangle is positive incident to an edge if the edge is one of its borders and the two agree in orientation .",
    "it is negative incident if the edge is one of its borders , but in the opposite orientation .",
    "otherwise it is not incident to the edge .",
    "for example , the triangle in figure [ fig : incidence ] is positive incident to the edge @xmath52 , negative incident to @xmath53 and @xmath54 and not incident to @xmath55 .    being defined as above the set of @xmath56 oriented triangles and their @xmath48 oriented edges , we introduce the matrix @xmath57 whose element @xmath58 gives account of the incidence between triangle @xmath59 and edge @xmath60 .",
    "more precisely    @xmath61 the knowledge of which edges are present in the set of prescribed boundary segments is expressed as a vector @xmath62 with @xmath63    with these notations set up we can now describe the equation system defining that a vector @xmath64 encodes an oriented triangular mesh with the pre - specified oriented boundary .",
    "this system has one equation for each edge .",
    "if the edge is not contained in the given boundary , this equation expresses that , among all triangles indicated by @xmath42 that contain the edge , there are as many triangles with same orientation as the edge as triangles with opposite orientation .",
    "if the edge is contained in the boundary with coherent orientation , there must be one more positive incident triangle than negative incident .",
    "if it is contained with opposite orientation , there is one less positive than negative incident . altogether the constraint for edge @xmath60 can be expressed as the linear equation @xmath65 and the entire system as @xmath66 so far , we did not incorporate the conormal constraint .",
    "actually not all conormal constraints are possible , exactly like not all discrete curves can be spanned in our framework but only union of edges of dictionary triangles , i.e. the collection of triangles defined in the previous section that determine the possible surfaces . for the conormal constraint ,",
    "only the conormal vectors that are tangent to dictionary triangles sharing an edge with the boundary curve are allowed",
    ". then the conormal constraint can be easily plugged into our formulation by simply imposing the corresponding triangles to be part of the surface , see figure  [ fig : tribound ] , and by defining accordingly a new boundary indicator vector @xmath67 .    denoting as @xmath68 the collection of those additional triangles , the complete constraint reads @xmath69 we discuss in the next section",
    "how discrete mean curvature can be evaluated in this framework .",
    "the various definitions of discrete mean curvature that have been proposed in the literature obviously depend on the chosen discrete representations of surfaces .",
    "presenting and discussing all possible definitions is out of the scope of the present paper .",
    "the important thing to know is that there is no fully consistent definition : the pointwise convergence of mean curvature can not be guaranteed in general but only in specific situations  @xcite . among the many possible definitions",
    ", we will use the edge - based one proposed by polthier  @xcite for it suits with our framework . recalling that , in the smooth case but also for generalized surfaces like varifolds  @xcite , the first variation of the area can be written in terms of the mean curvature",
    ", the definition due to polthier of the mean curvature vector at an interior edge @xmath70 of a simplicial surface reads @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the edge - length , @xmath73 is the dihedral angle between the two triangles adjacent to @xmath70 , and @xmath74 is the angle bisecting unit normal vector , i.e. , the unit vector collinear to the half sum of the two unit vectors normal to the adjacent triangles ( see figure  [ fig : local - triangle ] ) . remark that this formula is a discrete counterpart of the continuous @xmath75 depending on the principal curvatures , which is used in many papers for simplicity as definition of mean curvature .",
    "when the correct continuous definition @xmath76 is used , the formulas above and hereafter should be adapted .",
    "the justification of formula   by polthier  @xcite is as follows : it is exactly the gradient at any point @xmath77 of the area of the two triangles @xmath78 and @xmath79 adjacent to @xmath70 , and this gradient",
    "does not depend on the exact position of @xmath80 .",
    "indeed , one can subdivide @xmath78 , @xmath79 in four triangles @xmath81 , @xmath82 having @xmath77 as a vertex and such that @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the area of each triangle is half the product of the opposite edge s length and the height .",
    "therefore , if @xmath85 is the positively oriented edge opposite to @xmath80 in the triangle @xmath81 and @xmath86 , @xmath87 the rotations in the planes of @xmath78 , @xmath79 by @xmath88 , the area gradients of @xmath81 , @xmath89 at @xmath80 are @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "the sum is the total area gradient of @xmath94 at @xmath80 and equals @xmath95 , which coincides with the formula above .    as discussed by wardetsky et al .",
    "using the galerkin theory of approximation , this discrete mean curvature is an integrated quantity : it scales as @xmath96 when each space dimension is rescaled by @xmath96 .",
    "a pointwise discrete mean curvature rescaling as @xmath97 is given by ( see  @xcite ) @xmath98 where @xmath99 denotes the total area of the two triangles adjacent to @xmath70 .",
    "the factor @xmath100 comes from the fact that , when the mean curvatures are summed up over all edges , the area of each triangle is counted three times , once for each edge .",
    "then a discrete counterpart of the energy @xmath101 is given by @xmath102    in particular , the edge - based total squared mean curvature is @xmath103",
    "ultimately we are aiming at casting the optimization problem in a form that can be handled by standard linear optimization software . having in mind the framework described above where a discrete surface spanning the prescribed discrete boundary is given as a collection of oriented triangles satisfying equation   and chosen among a pre - specified collection of triangles , a somewhat natural direction at first glance seems to be solving a _",
    "quadratic program_. like in section  [ sec : mesh ] , let us indeed denote as @xmath104 the collection of binary variables associated to the `` dictionary '' of triangles @xmath105 and define    * @xmath106 the common edge to two adjacent triangles @xmath107 and @xmath108 ; * @xmath109 the corresponding dihedral angle ; * @xmath110 the angle bisecting unit normal ; * @xmath111 the total area of both triangles .",
    "then a continuous energy of the form @xmath112 can be discretized as @xmath113 with @xmath114 \\tilde\\varphi(t_i , n_i)&\\mbox{if $ i = j$}\\\\[1 mm ] 0&\\mbox{otherwise}\\end{array}\\right.$ ]    where @xmath115 allows to incorporate dependences on each triangle @xmath107 s position and unit normal @xmath116 . in particular ,",
    "the discrete willmore energy is @xmath117 with @xmath118 0&\\mbox{otherwise}\\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ]    assuming that the maps @xmath119 and @xmath115 are positive - valued , both energy matrices @xmath120 and @xmath121 are symmetric matrices in @xmath122 , and the minimization of either   or   with boundary constraints turns to be the following quadratic program with linear and integrality constraints : @xmath123 we know of no solution to solve this problem efficiently due to the integrality constraint .",
    "what is worse , even the relaxed problem where one optimizes over @xmath124^n$ ] is very hard to solve : terms of the form @xmath125 with @xmath126 are indefinite , so ( unless @xmath127 has a dominant diagonal ) the objective function is a non - convex one .    moreover ,",
    "a solution to the relaxed problem would not be of practical use : already for the 2d - problem of optimizing curvature energies over curves in the plane , the respective quadratic program favors fractional solutions .",
    "the relaxation would therefore not be useful for solving the integer program .",
    "however , in this case amini et al .",
    "@xcite showed that one can solve a linear program instead .",
    "this inspired us for the major contribution of this work : to cast the problem as an integer linear program .",
    "the key idea of the proposed integer linear program is to consider additional indicator vectors . aside from the indicator",
    "variables @xmath128 for basic triangles , one now also considers entries @xmath129 corresponding to _ pairs _ of adjacent triangles . such a pair is called _ quadrangle _ in the following",
    ". we will denote @xmath130 the augmented vector @xmath131 where @xmath132 run over all indices of adjacent triangles .",
    "the cost function can be easily written in a linear form with this augmented vector , i.e. it reads @xmath133 with ( see the notations of the previous section ) @xmath134    the major problem to overcome is how to set up a system of constraints that guarantees consistency of the augmented vector : the indicator variable @xmath129 for the pair of triangles @xmath59 and @xmath60 should be  @xmath50 if and only if both the variables @xmath128 and @xmath135 are @xmath50 .",
    "otherwise it should be  @xmath51 .",
    "in addition , one again wants to optimize only over indicator vectors that correspond to a triangular mesh .    to encode this in a linear constraint system ,",
    "a couple of changes are necessary .",
    "first of all , we will now have a constraint for each pair of triangle and adjacent edge .",
    "secondly , edges are no longer oriented .",
    "still , the set of pre - specified indices @xmath136 implies that the orientation of the border is fixed - we still require that for each edge of the boundary an adjacent ( oriented ) triangle is fixed to constrain the conormal information .    to encode the constraint system",
    "we introduce a modified notion of incidence .",
    "we are no longer interested in incidence of triangles and edges .",
    "instead we now consider the incidence of both triangles and quadrangles to pairs of triangles and ( adjacent ) edges .    for convenience",
    ", we define that triangles are positive incident to a pair of edge and triangle , whereas all quadrangles are negative incident .",
    "we propose an incidence matrix where lines correspond to pairs ( triangle , edge ) and columns to either triangles or quadrangles .",
    "the entries of this incidence matrix are either the incidence of a pair ( triangle , edge ) with a triangle , defined as @xmath137 or the incidence of a pair ( triangle , edge ) with a quadrangle , defined as @xmath138 the columns of this incidence matrix are of two types : either with only 0 s and exactly three @xmath50 ( a column corresponding to a triangle @xmath139 , whose three edges are found at lines @xmath140 ,",
    "@xmath141 , @xmath142 ) , or with only 0 s and exactly two @xmath143 s ( a column corresponding to a quadrangle @xmath144 that matches with lines @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) .    again",
    ", both the conormal constraints and the boundary edges can be imposed by imposing additional triangles indexed by a collection @xmath136 of indices .",
    "the general constraint has the form @xmath147 where the right - hand side depends whether the edge @xmath70 is shared by two triangles of the surface ( and even several quadrangles in case of self - intersection ) , or belongs to the new boundary indicated by the additional triangles .",
    "if @xmath70 is an inner edge , then the sum must be zero due to our definition of @xmath148 , otherwise there is an adjacent triangle , but no adjacent quadrangle , so the right - hand side should be  @xmath50 : @xmath149 to sum up , we get the following integer linear program : @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the total number of entries in @xmath130 , namely all triangles plus all pairs of adjacent triangles .",
    "it is worth noticing that such formulation allows triangle surfaces with self - intersection .",
    "solving integer linear programs is an np - complete problem , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this implies that , to the noticeable exception of a few particular problems  @xcite , no efficient solutions are known .",
    "as a consequence one often resorts to solving the corresponding linear programming ( lp ) relaxation , i.e. one drops the integrality constraints . in our case",
    "this means to solve the problem : @xmath152 or , equivalently , by suitably augmenting @xmath153 and @xmath154 in order to incorporate the second constraint @xmath155 , @xmath156 : @xmath157 there are various algorithms for solving this problem , the most classical being the simplex algorithm and several interior point algorithms .",
    "let us now discuss the conditions under which these relaxed solutions are also solutions of the original integer linear program .",
    "recalling the basics of lp - relaxation  @xcite , the set of admissible solutions @xmath158 is a polyhedron , i.e. a finite intersection of half - spaces in @xmath159 .",
    "a classical result states that minimizing solutions for the linear objective functions can be seeked among the extremal points of @xmath160 only , i.e. its vertices . denoting @xmath161 the integral envelope of @xmath160 , that is the convex envelope of @xmath162 , another classical result states that @xmath160 has integral vertices only ( i.e. vertices with integral coordinates ) if and only if @xmath163    since @xmath164 , according to theorem 19.3 in  @xcite , a _ sufficient _ condition for having @xmath163 is the property of @xmath34 being totally unimodular , i.e. any square submatrix has determinant either @xmath51 , @xmath165 or  @xmath50 . under this condition ,",
    "any extremal point of @xmath160 that is a solution of @xmath166}\\langle w,\\hat x\\rangle\\ ] ] has integral coordinates therefore is a solution of the original integer linear program @xmath167 theorem 19.3 in  @xcite mentions an interesting characterization of total unimodularity due to paul camion  @xcite : a matrix is totally unimodular if , and only if , the sum of the entries of every eulerian square submatrix ( i.e. with even rows and columns ) is divisible by four .    unfortunately , we can prove that , as soon as the triangle space is rich enough , the incidence matrix @xmath168 does not satisfy camion s criterion , therefore is not totally unimodular , and neither are the matrices for richer triangles spaces . as a consequence , there are choices of the triangle space for which the polyhedron @xmath164 may have not only integral vertices , or more precisely one can not guarantee this property thanks to total unimodularity .",
    "this is summarized in the following theorem .    the incidence matrix associated with any triangle space where each triangle has a large enough number of adjacent neighbors is not totally unimodular .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : counterex ] a configuration and , in table  [ tab ] , an associated square submatrix of the incidence matrix .",
    "the sum of entries over each line and the sum over each column are even , though the total sum of the matrix entries is not divisible by four . by a result of camion  @xcite ,",
    "the incidence matrix is not totally unimodular which yields the conclusion according to  @xcite[thm 19.3 ] .",
    "clearly , any triangle space for which this configuration can occur is also associated to an incidence matrix that is not totally unimodular .",
    "it is worth noticing that the previous theorem does not imply that the extremal points of the polyhedron @xmath160 are necessarily not all integral .",
    "it only states that this can not be guaranteed as usual by the criterion of total unimodularity .",
    "we will discuss in the next section what additional informations about integrality can be obtained from a few experiments that we have done using classical solvers for addressing the relaxed linear problem .",
    ".a square incidence matrix associated with the configuration in figure  [ fig : counterex ] .",
    "it is eulerian , i.e. the sum along each line and the sum along each column are even , but the total sum is not divisible by four . according to camion  @xcite , the matrix is not totally unimodular . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      our results above indicate that , necessarily , integer linear solvers  @xcite should be used .",
    "these commonly start with solving the linear programming relaxations , then derive further valid inequalities ( called _ cuts _ ) and/or apply a branch - and - bound scheme . due to the small number of fractional values that we have observed in our experiments , it is quite likely that the derivation of a few cuts only would give integral solutions . however",
    ", we did not test this so far because of the running times of this approach : in cases where we get fractional solutions the dual simplex method often needs as long as two weeks and up to @xmath169 gb memory ! from experience with other linear programming problems we consider it likely that the interior point methods implemented in commercial solvers will be much faster here ( we expect less than a day ) . at the same time",
    ", we expect the memory consumption to be considerably much higher , so the method would most probably be unusable in practice .",
    "we strongly believe that a specific integer linear solver should be developed rather than using general implementations .",
    "it is well known that , for a few problems like the knapsack problem  @xcite[chapter 24.6 ] , their specific structure gives rise to ad - hoc efficient approaches . recalling that our incidence matrix is very sparse and well structured ( the nonzero entries of each column are either exactly two @xmath143 , or exactly three @xmath50 ) we strongly believe that an efficient integer solver can be developed and our approach can be amenable to higher - resolution results in the near future .",
    "we have shown that the minimization under boundary constraints of mean curvature based energies over surfaces , and in particular the willmore energy , can be cast as an integer linear program .",
    "unfortunately , this integer program is not equivalent to its relaxation so the classical lp algorithms offer no warranty that the integer optimal solution will be found .",
    "this implies that pure integer linear algorithms must be used , which are in general much more involved .",
    "we believe however that the particular structure of the problem paves the way to a dedicated algorithm that would provide high - resolution _ global _ minimizers of the willmore boundary problem and generalizations .",
