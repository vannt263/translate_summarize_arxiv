    "there are various reasons why linear differential equations are easier than non - linear ones .",
    "one is of course that the solutions of linear differential equations form a vector space over the underlying field of constants .",
    "another important feature concerns the singularities .",
    "while for a nonlinear differential equation the location of the singularity may depend continuously on the initial value , this is not possible for linear equations . instead , a solution @xmath7 of a differential equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 are some analytic functions , can only have singularities at points @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "in this article , we consider the case where @xmath9 are polynomials . in this case",
    ", @xmath12 can have only finitely many roots .",
    "we shall also consider the case of recurrence equations @xmath13 where again there is a strong connection between the roots of @xmath12 and the singularities of a solution .    while every singularity of a solution leaves a trace in the leading coefficient of an equation ,",
    "the converse is not true .",
    "in general , the leading coefficient @xmath12 may have roots at a point where no solution is singular .",
    "such points are called apparent singularities , and it is sometimes of interest to identify them .",
    "one technique for doing so is called desingularization . as an example , consider the recurrence operator @xmath14 which is taken from  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.1 ) .",
    "here , @xmath15 denotes the shift operator @xmath16 . for any choice of two initial values @xmath17",
    ", there is a unique sequence @xmath18 with @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath0 applied to @xmath21 gives the zero sequence . a priori , it is not obvious whether or not @xmath21 is actually an integer sequence , if we choose @xmath22 from  @xmath23 , because the calculation of the @xmath24nd term from the earlier terms via the recurrence encoded by @xmath0 requires a division by @xmath25 , which could introduce fractions . in order to show that this division never introduces a denominator , the authors of  @xcite note that every solution of @xmath0 is also a solution of its left multiple @xmath26 the operator @xmath27 has the interesting property that the factor @xmath25 has been `` removed '' from the leading coefficient",
    "this is , however , not quite enough to complete the proof , because now a denominator could still arise from the division by @xmath28 at each calculation of a new term via  @xmath27 . to complete the proof ,",
    "the authors show that the potential denominators introduced by @xmath25 and by @xmath28 , respectively , are in conflict with each other , and therefore no such denominators can occur at all .",
    "the process of obtaining the operator @xmath27 from @xmath0 is called desingularization , because there is a polynomial factor in the leading coefficient of @xmath0 which does not appear in the leading coefficient of  @xmath27 . in the example above , the price to be paid for the desingularization was a new constant factor @xmath28 which appears in the leading coefficient of @xmath27 but not in the original leading coefficient of  @xmath0 .",
    "desingularization algorithms in the literature  @xcite care only about the removal of polynomial factors without introducing new polynomial factors , but they do not consider the possible introduction of new constant factors . a contribution of the present paper is a desingularization algorithm which minimizes , in a sense , also any constant factors introduced during the desingularization .",
    "for example , for the operator @xmath0 above , our algorithm finds the alternative desingularization @xmath29 which immediately certifies the integrality of its solutions .    in more algebraic terms , we consider the following problem . given an operator @xmath30[{\\partial}]$ ] , where @xmath31[{\\partial}]$ ] is an ore algebra ( see section  [ sect : pre ] for definitions ) , we consider the left ideal @xmath32l$ ] generated by @xmath0 in the extended algebra @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "the contraction of @xmath34 to @xmath31[{\\partial}]$ ] is defined as @xmath35[{\\partial}]$ ] .",
    "this is a left ideal of @xmath31[{\\partial}]$ ] which contains @xmath31[{\\partial}]l$ ] , but in general more operators .",
    "our goal is to compute a @xmath31[{\\partial}]$]-basis of @xmath36 . in the example",
    "above , such a basis is given by @xmath37 ( see example  [ ex : ah ] ) .",
    "the traditional desingularization problem corresponds to computing a basis of the @xmath38[{\\partial}]$]-left ideal @xmath39[{\\partial}]$ ] .",
    "the contraction problem for ore algebras @xmath38[{\\partial}]$ ] was proposed by chyzak and salvy  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.3 ) . for the analogous problem in commutative polynomial rings ,",
    "there is a standard solution via grbner bases  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8.7 ) .",
    "it reduces the contraction problem to a saturation problem .",
    "this reduction also works for the differential case , but in that case it is not so helpful because it is less obvious how to solve the saturation problem .",
    "a solution was proposed by tsai  @xcite , which involves homological algebra and d - modules theory .",
    "our work is based on desingularization for ore operators in  @xcite . in particular , the @xmath40-removing operator in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  4 ) provides us with a key to determine contraction ideals .",
    "the algorithm developed in this paper is considerably simpler than tsai s and at the same time it applies to arbitrary ore algebras rather than only the differential case .",
    "moreover , we compute a completely desingularized operator in a contraction ideal , which has minimal leading coefficient in terms of both degree and content .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : pre ] , we describe ore polynomial rings over a principal ideal domain , and extend the notion of @xmath40-removed operators to them .",
