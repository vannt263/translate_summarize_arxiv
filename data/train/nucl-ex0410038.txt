    "due to the relatively large mass of the heavy quarks which requires large energies for their creaction , the study of heavy flavor productions provides a unique tool to test the perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) calculations for heavy quark predictions  @xcite .",
    "the energy dependence of the total @xmath4 cross section measured from experiments is an important variable to constrain various parameters in the pqcd calculations  @xcite .",
    "it is predicted that the charm quarks are mostly produced from the initial fusion of gluons in a high energy hadron - hadron collision  @xcite .",
    "thus , the measurement of open charm hadron production is an important tool to study the initial parton distribution function in the colliding nucleons . in relativistic heavy ion collisions , the open charm @xmath6",
    "spectrum may be modified due to parton energy loss in the deconfined hot and dense medium . however , this energy loss is predicted to be significantly smaller compared to light quark hadrons due to the  deadcone effect \"  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "an increased @xmath8 ratio as a function of @xmath6 is expected in central a+a collisions compared to p+p collisions at the same beam energy .",
    "therefore , the measurement of the open charm @xmath6 spectrum can provide insights into the properties of the matter formed in the relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "furthermore , the production of open charm hadrons in the same collision system provides a comparison baseline to test the @xmath9 production mechanism in the relativistic heavy ion collisions at rhic energies since some theories predict a @xmath9 enhancement due to the charm quark coalescence effect  @xcite while others predict a @xmath9 suppression due to the color screening effect  @xcite .",
    "the data used for the direct @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 reconstruction and the charm semileptonic decay analysis were taken during the 2003 rhic run in d+au and p+p collisions at @xmath3=200 gev in the star experiment .",
    "a minimum bias d+au collision trigger was defined by requiring at least one spectator neutron in the au beam outgoing direction depositing energy in the zero degree calorimeter ( zdc ) .",
    "a total of 15 million minimum bias triggered d+au collision events were used in the @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 analysis .",
    "the data samples used in the electron analysis in d+au and p+p collisions were described in ref .",

    "the primary tracking device of the star detector is the time projection chamber ( tpc ) which measures the kinematics of charged particles . via the energy loss ( @xmath14 ) in the tpc ,",
    "charged kaons and pions can be identified with their momenta up to @xmath70.75 gev / c . due to the relatively small decay lengths ( @xmath15100@xmath16 m ) of the @xmath10 , @xmath1 and @xmath12",
    ", the limited tpc track projection resolution does not allow the decay topology identification by displaced vertices for open charm mesons from the primary collision vertex .",

    "the @xmath22 mesons were reconstructed through the decay of @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) with a branching ratio of 68% .",
    "specific treatment for the soft pion daughter @xmath25 was performed which required its @xmath6 and @xmath26 between 0.1 to 1 gev / c and the ratio of the @xmath0 to @xmath27 momentum @xmath289 since the @xmath27 has an average momentum of about 50 mev / c .",
