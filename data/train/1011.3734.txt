    "one of the most fascinating properties of the cuprates is the opening of a gap ( pseudogap ) above @xmath0 in the underdoped and optimally doped regime , where most abnormalities observed @xcite .",
    "the origin of the pseudogap and its relation to the superconducting ( sc ) gap are fundamental questions to realize the physics underline the high - temperature superconductors .",
    "although much progress has been made , the issue remains open .",
    "there are two distinct scenarios on the relation between the pseudogap and the sc gap@xcite .",
    "1 ) the one - gap scenario : the pseudogap is viewed as the precursor of the sc gap , reflecting pair fluctuation above @xmath0 , and would acquire phase coherence below @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the argument was based on angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes)@xcite , electron tunnelling @xcite , and thermal transport measurements@xcite , etc ; 2 ) the two - gap scenario : the pseudogap is not directly related to the sc gap , but emerge from some ordered states such as antiferromagnetic ( af)@xcite , staggered flux@xcite , stripe@xcite , spin or charge density wave@xcite , and orbital circulating currents@xcite , etc . and competes with sc gap .",
    "models account for these ordered states capture some aspects of the pseudogap , but a theoretical framework which gives a full picture from the pseudogap to sc state is not yet established .",
    "nevertheless , many experiments , including arpes@xcite , electronic raman scattering@xcite , and elastic neutron diffraction@xcite , etc . seem to favor the two - gap scenario .",
    "more recently , the improved arpes data@xcite showed that the gap opens near the antinodal region , and vanishes near the nodal region in the pseudogap state , which leads to the arc structure of the fermi surface . in the sc state",
    ", the pseudogap dominates the antinodal region , while the simple d - wave type gap dominates the nodal region .    in this letter",
    ", an effective single particle hamiltonian is proposed to study the pseudogap .",
    "the main idea came from the well known fact that moving holes in the antiferromagnetic background leads to two spatial scales : a long distance one and a short distance one . on the large spatial scale , the effective hopping integral",
    "is much reduced due to accumulated strong af correlation , while on the small spatial scale , the moving holes obtain an additional phase factor due to the surrounding af correlation .",
    "thus , pseudogap came directly from the af correlation and is irrelevant to the superconductivity .",
    "based on the effective hamiltonian , we find that the pseudogap opens near the antinodal regime and vanishes around the nodal region .",
    "its doping and momentum dependence qualitatively agree with recent arpes measurements .",
    "the arc structure of the fermi surface is also obtained , with its length expanding from underdoping to overdoping . in the sc state",
    ", the simple d - wave sc gap dominates the node region , while the pseudogap dominates the antinodal region .",
    "the resultant gap also agrees well with experiments .",
    "the neutron scattering@xcite and quantum oscillations measurements@xcite show that in the underdoped region , antiferromagnetic correlation remains on the cuo@xmath1 plane .",
    "its existence has also been found numerically@xcite .",
    "for each spin , its four nearest neighbors compose a plaquette . as a hole",
    "is introduced into the center of this plaquette , it will sense an effective magnetic field originated from its four neighboring opposite spins .",
    "correspondingly , there is a doping dependent gauge flux @xmath2 passing through the plaquette . in its journey of wanderings , the hole is affected by the staggered flux filed in which @xmath2 and @xmath3 appear alternatively .",
    "therefore , in the small spatial scale , when the hole hops , it encounters a phase shift @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) via aharonov - bohm effect , where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the flux quanta ) . on the other hand , in the large spatial scale",
    ", the effective hopping , represented by the hopping matrix @xmath8 ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 for the nearest , second nearest , and third nearest neighbor respectively ) , evaluated by all possible configurations , is substantially reduced by the strong af correlation .",
    "take the @xmath12 model as an example , we derive the following effective single particle hamiltonian by considering the effects of two spatial scales as , @xmath13where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the uniform bond order , @xmath17 .",
    "the summation is restricted in the af brillouin zone .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is diagonalized with the quasiparticle dispersion @xmath18 .    to determine the phase factor @xmath19",
    ", we calculate the effective staggered antiferromagnetic field , @xmath20 , which can be estimated by the spin - spin correlation between a spin 1/2 sits on the site of the given hole and its surrounding spins .",
    "that is @xmath21 with @xmath22 , and @xmath23 denoting land@xmath24 factor and bohr magneton , respectively .",
    "correspondingly the staggered flux @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 is the lattice constant , which is taken as @xmath27 throughout this paper .",
    "@xmath28 is the nearest neighbor ( nn ) spin - spin correlation , which is calculated by the exact diagonalization calculations ( ed ) as shown in table .",
    "since the effect of long - range spin - spin correlations and spatial variation of the effective magnetic field are neglected , the resultant flux and corresponding phase factor are overestimated to some degrees .",
    "the effective hopping matrix @xmath29 is also evaluated by the ed technique . for more hole cases",
    ", the hopping matrix should be divided by a factor approximately equal to hole number @xmath30 . in the above calculations",
    ", we have assumed that the extend @xmath12 model can be used to describe the many body effect qualitatively .",
    "@xmath31 ( about @xmath32 in the real system ) is taken as energy unit , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . comparing with the slave - boson treatment@xcite",
    ", the effective hopping terms are all enhanced due to many body effect .",
    "we further include the effect of the spin fluctuation under the random - phase approximation ( rpa)@xcite . since partial spin fluctuation has been taken into account for the contribution of additional phase factor in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we introduce an adjustable parameter to set the af instability at experimental value @xmath36 to avoid the overestimating@xcite .",
    "the bare spin susceptibilities are expressed as      with abbreviations @xmath38 @xmath39 . @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "since @xmath42 band is not independent due to the af correlation , the nondiagonal term @xmath43 arises from the umklapp processes . under this treatment",
    ", the dyson s equation can be expressed as @xmath44 with @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the fermionic and bosonic matsubara frequency .",

    "[ f.1 ] is rather rigid against doping along the nodal line with much reduced bandwidth @xmath51240 - 280mev@xmath52 , well consistent with the arpes measurement@xcite .",
    "the upper and lower band coincide at @xmath53 .",
    "this means that no full gap opens , unlike the mott insulator state . on the other hand",
    ", the lower band around @xmath54 shows clear flatness below @xmath55 .",
    "correspondingly , a pseudogap ( denoted by @xmath56 ) opens around the antinodal regime .",
    "the distance between the flatness part and fermi level decreases with increasing doping .",
    "the results obtained here qualitatively coincide with the arpes data@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that as far as the qp dispersion is concerned , even the effective single particle hamiltonian ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) has already succeeded to describe the main features mentioned above as shown in the insert of fig .",

    "[ f.2 ] shows the evolution of the pseudogap in the momentum space at different doping density .",
    "the magnitude of pseudogap is determined by evaluating the minimal distance of the lower band from fermi energy in the given direction .",
    "@xmath57 decreases with increasing @xmath58 , and disappears at a critical value of @xmath58 .",
    "this can be easily realized from fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] , where the gap opens near the antinodal regime due to the flatness of qp dispersion induced by the staggered magnetic flux , while the gap closes due to the crossing of the qp dispersion over @xmath55 .",
    "such behavior had been confirmed by various experiments @xcite .",
    "both the pseudogap region and its magnitude decrease with doping as evidenced by arpes data@xcite . the largest @xmath59 decreases from about @xmath60 at deep underdoped region to about @xmath61 at optimal doping with almost linear doping dependence . the numerical results consistent with arpes measurement , but the range of angle seem to have about @xmath62 reduction@xcite . results obtained by direct diagonalizing the eq",
    "( 1 ) show similar doping and momentum dependence . however , the magnitude and the variation range of angle are more reduced .",
    "comparing with the experiments , the present pseudogap vanishes somewhat slower with increasing @xmath58 .",
    "in fact , the value of angle @xmath63 is intimately related to the af correlation in momentum space , large @xmath64 means smaller af correlation .",
    "this implies that the present treatment is more appropriate to describe situations with strong af correlation . in the present treatments",
    ", we do not adopt any pairing potential , which is distinct from the previous slave - boson calculation@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the behavior of pseudogap differs from the early arpes discovery@xcite , and is far from that of the simple d - wave gap",
    ". therefore , the pseudogap is not related to the sc pairing .",
    "our theoretical results imply that the pseudogap exists even in the overdoped range .",
    "the evolution of the fermi surface ( fs ) is depicted in fig .",
    "the intensity is strong near the nodal region , and becomes weak gradually toward antinode due to the opening of the pseudogap in this region .",
    "thus , an arc fs structure@xcite forms around the nodal region .",
    "its length expands with increasing hole concentration .",
    "the arc extends to a large hole fs above @xmath65 , where the pseudogap vanishes gradually .",
    "so , the arc structure is a direct consequence of the pseudogap .",
    "the evolution of the arc structure and its length also qualitatively agree with the recent arpes experiment@xcite .",
    "now we discuss the existence and influence of pseudogap in the sc state . based on experimental observations@xcite and above analysis",
    ", we start with the assumption that the total gap of the quasiparticle dispersion contains two components : the pseudogap , and the sc gap of the standard d - wave bcs form @xmath66 . after some manipulations",
    ", the corresponding green s function is @xmath67^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath68 contains pseudogap @xmath69 , is the diagonal green s function in the pseudogap state under rpa treatment .",
    "we then compare our results with the experiments to see if @xmath70 ( one - gap scenario ) or it is substantial ( two - gap scenario ) .",
    "we take the @xmath71 case , which is near the optimal doping , as an example . in the nodal region ,",
    "the gap increases almost linearly with decreasing angle @xmath58 as shown in fig .",
    "this is the typical d - wave behavior , showing that d - wave sc pairing dominates this region .",
    "in fact , the gap comes from the sc condensation entirely because the pseudogap vanishes along the arc .",
    "in the antinodal region , large deviation from the standard d - wave is rather obvious .",
    "the shape and the value of the gap in the sc state with small value of @xmath72 are quite similar to that of the pseudogap state .",
    "even one increases @xmath72 up to @xmath73 such that @xmath74 , the shape keeps unchanged and the value of the gap enhances little .",
    "therefore , the pseudogap dominates the antinodal region . between the two regions , the pseudogap and the sc gap",
    "coexist and compete with each other , so the deviation from the simple d - wave enhances gradually when approaching to the antinodal region .",
    "these features consist well with recent experiments on the optimal doped bi2212@xcite , bi2201@xcite , and lsco@xcite , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ f.4 ] .    .",
    "the doping density is set to be @xmath71 , near the optimal doping .",
    "insert shows experimental data at optimal doping , together with our theoretical results with @xmath75 .",
    "circles are for lsco ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and triangles are for bi2201 ( ref .",
    "@xcite).,width=288 ]    the degree of the deviation depends on the ratio of @xmath76 . smaller ratio means larger deviation .",
    "such effect has been manifested in optimal doped bi2201@xcite and bi2212@xcite .",
    "the pseudogap in the two cuprates is almost the same at optimal doping , but the sc critical temperature in the former is three times of the latter .",
    "correspondingly , the deviation from the simple d - wave is much enhanced in bi2201 .",
    "the enhancement of the deviation with decreasing doping can also be explained following this way .",
    "such deviation had also been obtained in the previous one - gap scenario by applying the spin fluctuation theory@xcite .",
    "the correction was too small to account for the large deviation in underdoped bi2201 and bi2212 . based on our analysis",
    ", the two - gap scenario seems more appropriate to account for the observed gap behavior .",
    "the experiments support the one - gap scenario , mostly came from the earlier measurements@xcite .",
    "the data near the nodes were not easy to distinguish at that time . additionally , some measurements , such as the thermal transport properties@xcite may concern mainly on the nodal region , where the simple d - wave sc gap dominates . at last",
    ", we would like to point out that the enhancement of the sc gap with doping in the underdoped cuprates is an outcome of the decreasing pseudogap , which leads to the suppression of the density of state near the fermi energy .    in conclusion",
    ", we have proposed an effective single particle hamiltonian extracted from the exact diagonalization studies of the @xmath12 model to investigate pseudogap in the high - tc cuprates .",
    "the main idea is to take the effects of two spatial scales , one leads to much reduced hopping and one adds to a phase factor , both reflect physics of doped holes moving in af background , into account .",
    "our results revealed that the pseudogap is the single particle property , and is not directly related to the sc state .",
    "it opens near the antinodal region and vanishes around nodal region .",
    "the doping and momentum dependence of the pseudogap are qualitatively consistent with recent arpes measurements .",
