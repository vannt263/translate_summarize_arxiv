    "the discovery of four fast radio bursts ( frbs ; @xcite ) combined with the previously discussed lorimer burst @xcite sparked interest in the generation mechanisms of extremely non - stationary and powerful radiation by neutron stars ( nss ) .",
    "there are different scenarios for frbs ( see @xcite for a review ) but here we discuss only ns+ns mergers , which we consider to be the most plausible explanation .    the possibility of the frbs being generated by coalescing nss was predicted by @xcite . a sufficiently close neutron binary transforms , by emitting gravitational waves , into a supercompact system with a lifetime of several milliseconds ( several orbital revolutions ) . in the process ,",
    "strong electric fields are generated and conditions arise for acceleration of relativistic particles , which , in turn , generate non - thermal radio emission ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite pointed out that a merger of nss produces a highly magnetized and rapidly rotating object ( a spinar ) , which can lose up to 10 per cent of its total energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation in the process of collapse ( cf .",
    "however , the radiation of a rapidly and , possibly , differentially rotating spinar has to be highly concentrated along the axis of the object and , most likely , should be properly identified with the gamma - ray burst ( grb ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is tempting to associate frb with coalescing nss , which , in turn , are viewed as the most likely source of short grbs @xcite , the latter , in addition , being the best source of events for gravitational - wave experiments like laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) , virgo , etc .",
    "however , in the case of this interpretation we have to answer the fundamental question of the occurrence frequency of such bursts in the universe .",
    "a statistical analysis of frbs shows that its rate should be equal to 10@xmath1 yr@xmath0 per a milky way type galaxy  @xcite . at the same time , the studies based on the population synthesis of binary stars usually yield substantially lower star merger frequencies : 10@xmath210@xmath3 yr@xmath0 per galaxy  @xcite .",
    "the statistics of grbs yields even lower occurrence frequencies .",
    "however , the latter estimate depends on the beaming angle of grbs , which is very poorly defined @xcite . at the same time",
    ", @xcite points out that theoretically estimated ns coalescence rates reported , in particular , by @xcite , characterize the average or present - day occurrence frequencies , whereas the actual ns merger rate varied dramatically over the age of the universe .",
    "this study is based on the results of the scenario machine ( see a monography ; @xcite ) , which is the first and most mature population synthesis program aimed at simulating the evolution of a large number of single and binary stars .",
    "we focus on estimates of frb rate in the framework of the ns+ns binary merger model . in section 2 , we give a brief review of the scenario machine population synthesis . in section 3 , we calculate the ns merger rate for more plausible star formation rate ( sfr ) and compare with observed frequency of frb events . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss ns mergers as a result of the long binary evolution process and put some constraints on the natal kick velocities of nss . in section 5 , we compare our estimates of ns+ns and bh+bh merger rate with the upper limits for these rates set by the lack of gravitational - wave event detection in ligo experiment . in section 6 ,",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "the idea of population synthesis is to use our ( not always complete ) understanding of the evolution of binary stars , including relativistic stages , to generate millions computer - simulated artificial binaries in order to construct an artificial universe and estimate the occurrence rates of various types of binaries and the associated cataclysmic events : supernova ( sn ) explosions , mergers , disruptions , etc .",
    "it allows one to study the evolution of a large ensemble of binaries , to estimate the number of binaries at different evolutionary stages , and to explain the observational data .",
    "the very first population synthesis computations performed using the scenario machine showed that the current ns merger rate in a galaxy like ours is equal to several events in 4000 years ( see fig .  1 , case e    1 yr@xmath0 , @xmath4 20 mpc in @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent computations demonstrated a strong evolution of merger rate with the age of the universe @xcite and kick velocity @xcite .    currently , about a dozen teams are implementing a monte carlo version of the population synthesis @xcite .",
    "we use the scenario machine population synthesis program ( see a monography ; @xcite ) . the scenario machine , first , incorporates not only the evolution of binary stars , but also the rotational evolution of compact stellar objects : nss and white dwarfs ( wds ) .",
    "furthermore , because of a certain number of obscure issues in our understanding of the evolution of binary stars : poor understanding of common - envelope stages , possible collapse anisotropy , poor knowledge of the initial component mass ratio distribution in binaries  our approach uses the idea of optimization of all model parameters concerning ns evolution .",
    "for example , before computing the ns coalescence rate we optimize the parameters of evolution by comparing our artificial galaxy with observations @xcite .",
    "we make sure that ( 1 ) the number of simulated binaries of various types agrees ( approximately ) with the corresponding number of actually observed binaries : binary radio pulsars , x - ray pulsars , black holes ( bhs ) with massive and low - mass companions , ( 2 ) the distribution of space velocities of radio pulsars agrees with the corresponding distribution for actually observed radio pulsars , and ( 3 ) that the same is true for the number and parameters of radio pulsars with optical components , etc .    if the number of observed reference quantities ( the number of objects genetically related to ns+ns mergers ) is sufficiently large , it is no longer important to what extent we might misestimate the hidden parameters such as the common - envelope parameter or the initial distribution of component mass ratios in binary stars . in other words , given a satisfactory explanation of the statistics of observed binary types we can be sure enough of the predicted statistics of unobserved events , such as ns mergers . here",
    "we can formulate the following joke theorem ( the theorem of population synthesis ) : the observed universe of binary stars can be described to any desired degree of precision in terms of any , albeit incorrect , model with arbitrary large number of free parameters .",
    "the most striking confirmed predictions of the scenario machine include the discovery of radio pulsars paired with massive stars ( predicted by @xcite ; discovered by @xcite ) , the discovery of strong evolution of the x - ray emission of galaxies @xcite and its relation to the sfr  @xcite , prediction of the rate and nature of the evolution of mergers of wds with the total mass above the chandrasekhar limit ( see fig .  [ sn ] ; @xcite ) , and the discovery of dark energy signature in the statistics of grbs ( see fig . 2 ; @xcite ) .",

    "however , this parameter can be constrained substantially by comparing the results of population synthesis with the statistics of ns+ns and ns+wd binaries .",
    "this is understandable .",
    "if the collapse of an sn is highly anisotropic then the probability for the binary to be preserved after the explosion is very low .",
    "the collapse anisotropy is especially critical for the number of ns binaries ( i.e. , taylor type radio pulsars ) , because such systems form as a result of two supernova explosions in the same binary .",

    "[ kick_matlab ] ;  @xcite , see also fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "with such a kick velocity the current coalescence rate should be equal to 1/30001/5000 yr@xmath0 per @xmath15 m@xmath14 in a milky way type galaxy . however , this is the coalescence rate at the present epoch . as @xcite pointed out , the coalescence rate could have been significantly higher in the past , and we appear to be dealing with redshifts about 0.50.1 if frbs are cosmological events .",
    "it was first shown by the computations performed using the scenario machine that the coalescence rate evolves dramatically even if normalized to the rest frame @xcite .",

    "the most important remaining issue is to explain the observed occurrence frequency of frb events . @xcite",

    ". however , totani et al .",
    "2013 note that the discrepancy practically disappears if the increase of the ns coalescence rate in the past due to higher sfr in the universe is taken into account .",
    "actually , nss should have sufficiently strong magnetic fields for the orbital triggering mechanism @xcite to operate .",
    "unfortunately , the magnetic field dissipation time - scale for an ns is poorly known .",
    "radio pulsar studies appear to imply that magnetic field dissipates during the first 10 myr after the birth of the ns .",
    "however , the decay of radio pulsars may be due to the change of the angle between the magnetic and rotation axes rather than the dissipation of magnetic field .",
    "on the other hand , accreting nss in binaries  x - ray pulsars  show that , judging by the companion , the magnetic field has an age and strength of @xmath30 years and @xmath31 g , respectively @xcite . the computations of the coalescence rate evolution as a function of the age after star formation show that 70 per cent of coalescing nss have ages below 100 myr @xcite .",
    "let us now compare the resulting ns coalescence rate using the scenario machine to the frb rate .",
    "the frb rate should be @xmath32 day@xmath0 sky@xmath0 , where the 1-@xmath33 uncertainty assumes poissonian statistics @xcite .",
    "if it is interpreted as a burst rate per unit comoving volume out to z = 1 , then for frb rate we find @xmath34 yr@xmath0 per mpc@xmath35 .",
    "this result is consistent with the scenario machine estimate of ns+ns mergers ( fig .",
    "the cumulative number of ns+ns mergers per year inside the sphere of redshift z and frb rate are presented on fig .",
    "the observed frb rate is in better agreement with the model using sfr based on the adopted @xcite imf , than the @xcite imf based one .",
    "the concrete mechanism of the burst could be the revival of pulsar mechanism during the last revolutions before the coalescence , when the orbital frequency reaches several khz @xcite .",
    "the burst duration agrees well with the observed values . as for the observed fluxes , we could write down many formulas",
    ". however , the development of the theory of radio pulsars shows that it makes no sense to use any formulas for estimating radio emission , and that empirical data combined with a simple model of multidipole losses yield much more reliable results .",
    "a more correct approach should involve the use of the quadrupole formula @xcite , however , the losses it yields at maximum agree with those computed in terms of the dipole model .",
    "it is therefore quite safe to use the dipole formula , i.e. , assume that the rate of emission is proportional to the fourth power of frequency .",
    "given that the crab nebula with its 30 hz rotation frequency emits a radio flux of 1000 jy , a similar crab with a 1 khz frequency should produce a @xmath36 greater power output .",
    "this means that such an object would produce a 1 jy flux from a distance of 70 mpc . to explain the observed intensity of frb , a 1  jy flux",
    "should be observed from a source at 2 gpc , i.e. , 30 times more distant . to this end",
    ", we must assume that the frb magnetic field should be stronger by the same factor of 30 .",
    "an analysis of the distribution functions of radio and x - ray pulsars shows that up to one half of all nss may possess such magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "a factor of 2 is the approximate accuracy of the estimated frb occurrence rate .",
    "recently , @xcite published a paper about the predicted observed relativistic binary coalescence rates detectable by gravitational wave detectors .",
    "most of the paper is dedicated to predicting the detection rates for future ( advanced ) ligo versions based on observational data and theoretical predictions .",
    "the wide range of the resulting ns merger rates is caused by the large uncertainties of kick velocities assumed in the theoretical models @xcite which are being used by the above authors , although previously it was shown that high kick velocity values contradict to observable fraction of ns+ns binaries among the total number of pulsars on the sky ( see fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the used models completely lack the first and most complete , incorporating all the observed stages of the evolution of binaries with relativistic components and of ordinary stars , computations of the ns coalescence rates performed long before the studies used in that paper were published ( for example , see a monography ;  @xcite ) .",
    "we reiterate that ns mergers are a result of the long binary evolution process starting from two optical main - sequence stars , through the two sn explosions , and involving ejector , propeller , accreting evolution of the nss , and after the pure evolution of the two nss controlled the angular dissipation of gravitational waves . before predicting",
    "the ns and bh coalescence rate one has to : ( 1 ) explain the existence and statistical properties ( the number and characteristic luminosity ) of x - ray pulsars with massive ob - type stars , ( 2 ) the statistics of propellers and ejectors in massive systems , ( 3 ) the statistics of bhs in massive binaries , ( 4 ) the existence of binary radio pulsars with nss and wds , and ( 5 ) the lack of such systems with bhs .",
    "the answer to the question of the ns coalescence rate actually depends on what happens in low - mass stars .",
    "the point is that one of the most obscure issues in the evolution of binary stars ",
    "the common - envelope stage  shows up most conspicuously during the formation of low - mass cataclysmic variables , which is often controlled by gravitational waves .",
    "the first computations of the ns coalescence rate made using the scenario machine date back to 1987 @xcite and the results have remained practically unchanged until now .",
    "for example , after determining the optimum evolution parameters @xcite , we performed a detailed analysis of the effect of collapse anisotropy and confirmed our earlier conclusions that the kick velocity can not exceed 100150 km s@xmath0 for a maxwellian distribution ( @xcite , see also fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "otherwise , you can not explain the observed ns+ns fractions among the total number of pulsars ( fig .",
    "[ kick_matlab ] ) .",
    "it must be emphasized that the characteristic velocity depends on the form of the natal kick distribution .",
    "thus earlier a number of authors @xcite proposed non - maxwellian distributions with a higher fraction of higher kick velocities ( fig .",
    "[ kik ] ) .",
    "this is especially important for explaining the observed distribution of radio pulsar velocities .",
    "however , the particular form of the distribution is of little importance for this study , because in all the distributions considered the number of small natal kicks is approximately the same to within a factor of 2 .",
