    "the mass spectrum of a hadron is a fundamental problem in hadronic physics .",
    "the qcd motivated potential model with scalar confinement in the nonrelativistic limit has been employed to deal with this problem .",
    "however the scalar potential confinement behaves badly@xcite in the limit of small quark mass and diverges from qcd once we consider the relativistic corrections .",
    "it was found that the spin independent relativistic corrections using the low velocity wilson loop formalism differed from those of scalar confinement@xcite . the flux tube model which plays an important role in describing the relativistic meson states extends the nonrelativistic constituent quark model to include the gluonic degree of freedom .",
    "the review of the flux tube model may be found in swanson s paper@xcite .",
    "the qcd string or the relativistic flux tube(rft ) model which is the simplest generalization of the potential model overcomes these shortcomings of the scalar confinement .",
    "its fundamental assumption is that the qcd dynamical ground state for large quark separation consists of a rigid straight tube - like color flux structure connecting the quarks and for massless quarks it reduces to nambu string.@xcite this model is consistent with both spin - dependent and spin - independent qcd expectations while the scalar confinement potential model@xcite is not consistent with spin - independent qcd relativistic correction .",
    "it includes the angular momentum and the rotational energy of the interacting field while only the field energy is considered in the potential model . even though with this simple physical picture the rft model coincides with the qcd relativistic correction derived from the rigorous wilson loop formalism .",
    "next we review the straight qcd string model and give the qcd string equations of mesons .",
    "consider a light - light(ll ) meson made up of two spinless quarks with equal mass @xmath0 .",
    "the quarks may rotate around their center of mass and vibrate in the radial direction .",
    "we obtain the following equations of the qcd string@xcite for the ll mesons ,    @xmath1    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are angular momentum and energy of the meson respectively , v(r ) represents the short range potential , a is the confinement constant and r is the interquark separation .",
    "we also define the functions :    @xmath4   \\label{eq.4}\\\\ w_r = \\sqrt{p_r ^2 + m^2 } \\label{eq.5}\\\\ \\gamma_\\bot^2 = \\frac{1}{1- v_\\bot^2 } \\label{eq.6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    similarly , for a heavy - light meson(hl ) made up of one heavy quark with mass m and one light quark with mass @xmath5 .",
    "they satisfy the conditions as @xmath6 and @xmath7 , we obtain the equations of qcd string for hl mesons ,    @xmath8    the paper is organized as follows . in section ii we solve the rft equations under two limits for the ll mesons .",
    "we demonstrate an analytical approximation solution under the deep radial limit in section iii .",
    "the comparison of solutions for ll mesons with those for hl mesons is discussed in section iv .",
    "special attentions are payed to the string slopes since they are significant criterions to tell whether a qcd motivated model is reasonable or not . finally in section v our conclusions are summarized .",
    "we now consider the circular motion limit for the ll mesons in which the two light spinless quarks moving circularly around their center of mass .",
    "so this will reduce the @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this reduction yields    @xmath11    pluging functions @xmath12 back into the general ll rft equations , we obtain    @xmath13    therefore we find the @xmath14 slope for the ll meson is ,    @xmath15    we note that it is equal to half of that for hl meson .",
    "we will discuss this slope again in section [ comp ] where the results can be seen clearly in the corresponding graphs no matter whether there is color coulomb potential or not .      under the deep radial limit ,",
    "considering the ll mesons and assuming again the light quark mass is zero we want to explore the effect of the short range color coulomb potential . that the qcd string reduces to a time component vector potential",
    "was shown under the deep radial limit in which @xmath16.@xcite it is reasonable to apply the semi - classical quantization condition for a spherically symmetric system to quantize the qcd string ,    @xmath17    where @xmath18 represent the radial distances at the turning points of the motion .",
    "assume the potential takes the simple form @xmath19@xcite .",
    "we obtain under the deep radial limit ,    @xmath20    we now define the dimensionless variables ,    @xmath21    then we obtain using the new dimensionless variables    @xmath22    where @xmath23    the turning points are as follows :    @xmath24    now we are ready to evaluate the integral    @xmath25    assume ,    @xmath26    therefore ,    @xmath27     + where we let @xmath28    similarly ,    @xmath29     + define    @xmath30    then ,    @xmath31     + where @xmath32    due to the following relation ,    @xmath33    plug them into eq.([iii ] )    @xmath34 } \\nonumber   \\\\ & = & \\frac{u^2\\sqrt{e^2 + 2l+k}}{2}\\int^{1}_{0 } dy\\big{[}\\sqrt{(1-y^2)(1-my^2)}(\\frac{\\displaystyle 1}{\\displaystyle -uy+e}+\\frac{\\displaystyle 1}{\\displaystyle uy+e})\\,\\big { ] }   % = \\frac{\\displaystyle u^2 \\sqrt{e^2 + 2l+k}}{\\displaystyle   e}\\int^{1}_{0 } dy \\frac{\\displaystyle \\sqrt{(1-y^2)(1-my^2)}}{\\displaystyle 1-hy^2 }   \\label{mm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    therefore we get the tcv integral for the ll mesons under the deep radial limit ,    @xmath35    where    @xmath36    using the semi - classical quantization condition for a spherically symmetric system to quantize the qcd string , we obtain ,    @xmath37    when evaluating eq.([bb ] ) we need replace the classical angular momentum with langer correction to take into account the centrifugal singularity , namely @xmath38 . moreover ,",
