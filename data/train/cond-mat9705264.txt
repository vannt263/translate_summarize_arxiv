    "the gunn effect appears in many semiconductor samples presenting negative differential resistance and subject to voltage bias conditions @xcite .",
    "it consists of a periodic shedding of pulses of the electric field at the injecting contact , which then progress and are annihilated at the receiving contact . as a result there appears a periodic oscillation of the current through a passive external circuit attached to the semiconductor . under different conditions ,",
    "the current self - sustained oscillation may be caused by the motion of charge accumulation layers ( charge monopoles ) @xcite , not by the usual electric field pulses which are charge dipoles .",
    "most of the experiments on the gunn effect in different materials take place in samples with attached planar contacts , so that the wave motion may be safely assumed to be one - dimensional . despite the vast literature on the gunn effect ,",
    "it is surprising that many basic questions remain poorly understood .",
    "for example , given a description of the charge transport in the bulk semiconductor ( say at the level of drift - diffusion and rate equations ) , which are the proper boundary conditions for given contacts and how they affect the self - sustained current oscillations .",
    "the first question has been addressed in a companion paper , ref .",
    "@xcite , while the second will be answered here .",
    "until recently , when confronted with the gunn effect , theorists would resort to computer simulations of more or less complicated models ( which were supposed to reflect the physics of a given semiconductor ) , and would then explain qualitatively their numerics .",
    "resort to special solutions valid for infinite semiconductors at constant current bias conditions @xcite , or to extrapolations of kroemer s nl criterion @xcite were often used to interpret the simulation results .",
    "this left the processes of generation and annihilation of domains at the contacts ( and in fact it also left out the dynamics of wavefronts and pulses ) outside theoretical considerations .",
    "concerning asymptotic descriptions of the gunn effect which delve deeper than just numerical simulations of drift - diffusion models , some progress has been made recently @xcite .",
    "these works propose asymptotic descriptions of the gunn effect exploiting the fact that this effect is seen most clearly in semiconductors having a large value of the product of sample length times doping ( basically a dimensionless length ) .",
    "the role of the `` n - l product '' in the analysis of the gunn instability was already discovered by kroemer  @xcite and exploited to study the linear stability ( small signal analysis ) of stationary solutions by many authors @xcite .",
    "it was recognized only much later that in the limit of large dimensionless length ( n - l product ) it is possible to describe asymptotically both the onset @xcite and the fully developed gunn instability @xcite . in this asymptotic limit the processes of repeatedly generating a new wave ( a charge monopole or dipole domain ) at the injecting contact , the motion of the wave and its annihilation at the receiving contact may be well separated . then they can be analyzed and combined to fully describe the gunn effect . in particular , the effect of contacts on these processes and in determining the shape of the current oscillation can be clearly stated . in this paper",
    "we use our asymptotic theory to study kroemer s model for n - gaas under b.c .",
    "corresponding to ideal ms contacts .",
    "we find that these b.c",
    ". give rise to a multivalued control current - field characteristic at the injecting contact .",
    "the asymptotic analysis shows that the gunn effect can be mediated by both charge monopole or dipole domains according to the values of the contact parameters .",
    "shedding of new charge dipole waves from the injecting contact is adiabatic in clear distinction with what happens if the control characteristic of the contact is single - valued @xcite . in the later case ( analyzed for a p - ge model in ref .",
    "@xcite ) the charge dipole pulses are created very rapidly at the injecting contact and they advance and grow simultaneously ( see also @xcite ) , whereas for multivalued control characteristic the boundary layer at the injecting contact grows adiabatically to a much greater size before a new pulse can be shed .",
    "these facts may determine appreciably the shape of the current oscillations .",
    "our analysis could be extended to more complex models also displaying the gunn effect , @xcite . depending on the values of the parameters characterizing the injecting contact and of the dc voltage bias , we find gunn oscillations mediated by charge accumulation and depletion monopole wavefronts , and high and low field charge dipole domains .",
    "we also find narrow regions in the parameter space where multiple shedding of dipole domains at the injecting contact occurs . we have thus found a characterization of all possible dynamic behaviors which an ideal metal - semiconductor contact would give rise to in the kroemer model for the gunn effect .",
    "this opens the possibility of extracting information about the contacts from the analysis of the gunn oscillations themselves , a subject of considerable interest for applied researchers .",
    "the rest of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we present kroemer s model and the boundary conditions for metal - semiconductor contacts discussed in the companion paper @xcite . in section",
    "iii we present our asymptotic analysis of kroemer s model and find that different types of gunn effect are possible according to the values of the bias and of certain dimensionless parameters appearing in the b.c . , @xmath0 and @xmath1 : charge monopoles ( moving charge depletion and accumulation layers ) , high and low field solitary waves ( charge dipoles ) , multiple ( low field ) charge dipoles , are predicted and confirmed by numerical simulations .",
    "section v contains our conclusions whereas the appendices are devoted to different technical matters related to the main text .",
    "the unipolar drift - diffusion model for the gunn effect proposed by kroemer @xcite , is generally accepted to provide a rather complete description of the main features of this effect . in the dimensionless units described in ref .",
    "@xcite , kroemer s model is @xmath2 eq .  ( [ eq ] ) is ampre s law which says that the sum of displacement current and drift - diffusion current is equal to the total current density @xmath3 . it can be obtained by differentiating the poisson equation , @xmath4 , with respect to time , substituting the charge continuity equation @xmath5 [ the electron current density is of the drift - diffusion type : @xmath6 , and then integrating the result with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "the electron velocity is assumed to be n - shaped . for specific numerical calculations we shall use kroemer s curve  @xcite @xmath8 ( it has a maximum @xmath9 at @xmath10 followed by a minimum @xmath11 at @xmath12 ) and the electron difusivity @xmath13 to be constant .",
    "the dc bias @xmath14 is the average electric field on the semiconductor sample .",
    "( [ eq])-([bias ] ) need to be solved with an appropriate initial field profile @xmath15 and subject to the corresponding b.c . for ideal metal - semiconductor",
    "the following mixed boundary conditions have been derived in @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 , ( @xmath19 ) , are dimensionless parameters which are a combination of the semiconductor effective density of states , contact barrier height , richardson s constant , doping and temperature ( see @xcite ) . in",
    "what follows , @xmath17 will be assumed to be positive because the physically interesting phenomena ( including the usual gunn effect mediated by high field domains ) are observed for these values of @xmath17 ( see phase diagram in @xcite ) .    for typical n - gaas data , @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "in this limit , we shall find approximate solutions to the initial boundary value problem ( [ eq])-([bcl2 ] ) for @xmath22 and @xmath3 . strictly speaking ,",
    "the simple asymptotic description that follows holds in the limit @xmath23 , even when @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath20 just simplifies the description of the traveling waves of electric field in the semiconductor through the use of characteristic equations and shock waves  @xcite .",
    "for example , it is shown in appendix [ carac ] ( by using the method of characteristics ) that the boundary condition ( [ bc02 ] ) implies that the electric field at the injecting contact , @xmath25 , obeys the following equation : @xmath26 these expressions constitute a dirichlet boundary condition for the electric field which contains the same information as the mixed condition ( [ bc02 ] ) .",
    "the contact curve , @xmath27 , presents two extrema , a minimum , @xmath28 , and a maximum , @xmath29 , at the same field values as the electron velocity curve @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 tends to @xmath32 for high electric fields . as we shall see below , during most of an oscillation period , @xmath33 , and this expression yields a multivalued contact - characteristic curve relating the field at the injecting contact to the actual value of the current density .    to take advantage of the large - length limit",
    ", we will use the following rescaled time and length , @xmath34 then eqs .  ( [ eq])-([bias ] ) become @xmath35 notice that the boundary condition ( [ e_0 ] ) becomes @xmath36 in the limit @xmath20 .",
    "in a previous paper @xcite we have analyzed the stationary solutions of kroemer s model with metal - semiconductor contacts and discussed their stability .",
    "no stable stationary solution is expected for certain ranges of bias and the cathode contact parameters @xmath37 and @xmath1 . in these circumstances ,",
    "the gunn effect mediated by either moving charge monopoles or dipoles might appear .",
    "a rich phenomenology of propagating waves and current oscillations has been numerically observed for these parameter ranges . among them , we have observed both high ( figs .",
    "[ diphig1 ] , [ diphig2 ] ) and low ( fig .",
    "[ diplow ] ) field solitary waves ( moving charge dipoles ) , multiple low field dipoles ( fig .",
    "[ multi ] ) , moving charge accumulation ( fig .",
    "[ monacu ] ) and charge depletion monopoles ( fig .  [ mondep ] ) . in ref .",
    "+ citecompanion , we have identified the critical currents determining which type of waves mediate the current oscillation ( in the limit @xmath38 ) .",
    "they are related to the boundary conditions in the following way :    * if @xmath39 , the gunn effect is mediated by moving charge accumulation monopoles [ @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the local maxima of the contact current and electron velocity curves , both reached at @xmath42 . *",
    "if @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , the gunn effect is mediated by moving charge depletion monopoles [ @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the local minima of the contact current and electron velocity curves , both reached at @xmath47 ; @xmath48 is the value at which @xmath31 saturates at high electric fields ] . * if @xmath49 , moving charge dipoles mediate the gunn effect ( see ref.@xcite for more details ) .    as shown in the figures , there are several stages in each period of the current oscillation corresponding to the processes of generation , propagation and annihilation of electric field domains .",
    "each stage has its own time and space scales , and hence the oscillation can be suitably described by means of a matched asymptotic analysis .",
    "for instance , the annihilation of wavefronts takes place on a fast time scale compared to that governing wavefront propagation .",
    "thus on the time scale of wavefront propagation , the annihilation of wavefronts is a quasi - instantaneous process during which the time derivative of the current density changes appreciably while the current itself , @xmath50 , does not change . on the other hand",
    ", the generation of fronts takes place adiabatically on a much slower time scale comparable to wavefront propagation . in this stage both @xmath50 and its derivative change appreciably .",
    "this is quite different from the fast generation of fronts and pulses observed for other types of boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "as long as these different processes take place on different time and space scales , there are different stages of the oscillation which can be analyzed separately .",
    "this happens for certain bias ranges .",
    "we shall then construct the approximate electric field and current density solutions by means of matched asymptotic expansions .",
    "a detailed description of a period of the current oscillation will be then obtained . for other bias values ,",
    "several processes occurs almost simultaneously ( e.g. , the annihilation of a wavefront may occur during the process of detachment of another wavefront from the injecting boundary layer for low bias values ) .",
    "this complicates the asymptotic description without adding much to our physical understanding , so that we will omit the details .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath51 , the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ s - eq])-([s - bias ] ) are piecewise constant : on most of the @xmath52-interval , @xmath53 is equal to one or another of the zeros of @xmath54 [ notice that this equation may have three zeroes , we denote by @xmath55 , separated by transition layers that connect them . at @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    "there are boundary layers ( quasi - stationary most of the time ) , which we call _ injecting and receiving layers _ , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that the propagation of fronts turns out to be a quasi - stationary process while the generation is not .",
    "thus , two different asymptotic approaches will be used : one for the description of the quasistationary propagation of fronts and the other for their ( non - quasistationary ) generation .      in this section",
    "we will present the asymptotics of the quasistationary propagation of wavefronts , and of the corresponding time evolution of the density current .",
    "wavefronts are moving transition layers connecting regions of the sample where the electric field is spatially uniform . in order to describe their quasistationary propagation",
    "we will proceed as follows .",
    "we assume that @xmath58 is either @xmath59 or @xmath60 outside boundary layers and wavefronts .",
    "let the wavefront located at @xmath61 move with velocity @xmath62 .",
