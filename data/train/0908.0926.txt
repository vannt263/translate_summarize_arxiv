    "active galactic nucleus ( agns ) are systems mainly composed by a supermassive black - hole ( smbh ) , an accretion disk , and bipolar relativistic jets .",
    "agns produce non - thermal continuum emission along the whole spectrum , from radio to @xmath0-rays .",
    "the high - energy non - thermal radiation is expected to come from the jets , which are formed by a magnetized plasma moving relativistically . besides the emission in the continuum , agns present optic and uv lines .",
    "some of these lines are observed with a broad fwhm , with an associated velocity for the emitting gas of @xmath1  cm  s@xmath2 .",
    "the region where these lines are formed is called the broad line region ( blr ) , and surrounds the smbh .",
    "the size of the blr is related to its luminosity , @xmath3 [ ] .",
    "for instance , for @xmath4  erg  s@xmath2 ( faranoff - riley ( fr ) i case ) , @xmath5  cm , and for @xmath6  erg  s@xmath2 ( fr ii case ) @xmath7  cm .",
    "the blr is thought to be filled with a clumpy medium composed by cold clouds ( @xmath8  k ) of radius @xmath9  cm [ ] . in this work",
    "we study the interaction between a cloud of the blr with the relativistic jet close to the smbh in an agn . assuming standard values of the cloud parameters , and adopting a hydrodynamical supersonic jet",
    ", we estimate the high - energy emission produced by this interaction for two different kinds of agn : a non - blazar source of fr  i type , and a powerful flat - spectrum radio quasar of fr  ii type .",
    "a cloud with a radius @xmath10 that moves with a velocity @xmath11  cm  s@xmath2 , completely enters into the jet in a time @xmath12  s. for an effective penetration of the cloud into the jet , a huge contrast between the cloud and the jet densities ( @xmath13 ) is necessary . the cloud density @xmath14",
    "is fixed to @xmath15  @xmath16 [ ] and the density of the jet , @xmath17 , is determined through the equation : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the velocity of the jet , @xmath20 the jet lorentz factor , and @xmath21 is the section of the jet at the interaction height @xmath22 , where @xmath23 . in order to obtain @xmath17 we need to fix @xmath22 at which the cloud penetrates into the jet .",
    "when the cloud penetrates into the jet , a shock is formed and propagates through the cloud at a velocity @xmath24 . in a time",
    "@xmath25 the shock crosses the whole cloud .",
    "we focus on the stage when the cloud is inside the jet ( @xmath26 ) at the zero order approximation , implying that the interaction should take place at least at @xmath27 and @xmath28  cm for an fr  i ( @xmath29  erg  s@xmath2 ) and an fr  ii ( @xmath30  erg  s@xmath2 ) , respectively . at such @xmath22",
    ", we obtain for all cases @xmath31  @xmath16 and @xmath32 .",
    "the shock heats the cloud material up to a temperature @xmath33  k. the hot plasma cools via thermal bremsstrahlung radiation with a thermal luminosity @xmath34  erg  s@xmath2 , peaking at soft @xmath0-rays .",
    "a bow shock is also formed in the jet , reaching the steady state at a distance @xmath35 from the cloud in a time @xmath36 .",
    "the cloud could escape from the jet in a time @xmath37 ( fr  i case ) and @xmath38  s ( fr  ii case ) , being @xmath39 , although kelvin - helmholtz and rayleigh - taylor instabilities can destroy the cloud in a time @xmath40 few times @xmath41 , shorter than @xmath42 .",
    "we note that the shocked cloud is also accelerated by the jet and might reach a velocity @xmath43 , but it is likely that before this happens the cloud escapes from the jet .",
    "in the bow shock , particles can be accelerated via relativistic fermi - i mechanism . given the much lower velocity of the cloud shock",
    ", we will neglect at this stage its role to accelerate particles .",
    "the acceleration rate of particles , for which we adopt here a phenomenological prescription : @xmath44 , depends on the magnetic field @xmath45 in the post - shock region of the bow shock [ ] .",
    "we will consider three different cases , varying the value of @xmath45 and the luminosity of the jet : i ) case 0 , with @xmath29  erg  s@xmath2 and @xmath46  g ( fr  i case ; dominant blr photon energy density ) ; ii ) case i , with @xmath30  erg  s@xmath2 and @xmath47  g ( fr  ii case ; dominant blr photon energy density ) ; and iii ) case ii , with @xmath30  erg  s@xmath2 and @xmath48  g ( fr  ii case ; dominant magnetic energy density , 10% of equipartition with the post - shock matter ) .",
    "the magnetic fields for cases 0 and i are very much below equipartition .",
    "these cases are considered to explore the situation when external compton dominates the radiation output , where the external ( blr ) energy density is @xmath49 . in case ii , for @xmath45-values close to equipartition",
    ", synchrotron emission will dominate .",
    "work on the case when synchrotron self - compton is the dominant radiation channel is on - going .",
    "the maximum energy ( @xmath50 ) achieved by electrons is constrained by the escape of these particles from the bow - shock region , advected by the shocked material of the jet on a time @xmath51 ( case 0 : @xmath52  ev and case i : @xmath53  ev ) , and by synchrotron losses ( case ii : @xmath54  ev ) . for protons",
    "the maximum energy is determined by the size of the acceleration region , @xmath35 ( case 0 : @xmath55  ev , case i : @xmath56  ev , and case ii : @xmath57  ev ) .",
    "we assume here that the 20% of the @xmath58 fraction transferred to the cloud is converted into ( non - thermal ) luminosity of the accelerated particles , i.e. @xmath59 .",
    "we determine the constant @xmath60 of the injection function @xmath61 , assuming a power - law with an index @xmath62 and a cut - off at higher energies : @xmath63 .",
    "the electron energy distribution , @xmath64 , is determined by the escape of particles and radiation losses ( synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic ) ) , reaching the steady state on a time @xmath65 .",
    "the steady distribution of these relativistic leptons is @xmath66 ( in cases 0 and i ; escape dominance ) and @xmath67 ( in case ii ; synchrotron cooling ) . on the other hand ,",
    "protons escape from the bow - shock region after losing a negligible fraction of their energy by @xmath68 interactions .    as noted above",
    ", the most important emission process is ic scattering in cases 0 and i. in the former , the achieved luminosities are @xmath69 and @xmath70  erg  s@xmath2 ( peaking in hard x - rays and in @xmath0-rays , respectively ) , and in the latter , @xmath71 and @xmath72  erg  s@xmath2 ( peaking in soft x - rays and in @xmath0-rays , respectively ) . in case ii",
    ", corresponding to the larger value of @xmath45 , the synchrotron emission is the most important channel of energy loss , peaking in the the infrared and decreasing smoothly afterwards up to soft @xmath0-rays . in this case ,",
    "synchrotron and ic luminosities reach values @xmath73 and @xmath74  erg  s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the ic maximum is always in the sub - tev range , given the strong photon - photon absorption in the blr photon field , producing pairs that will also generate synchrotron and ic radiation ( e.g. [ ] ) . regarding relativistic protons ,",
    "since the density of particles in the bow - shock region is much lower than that of the cloud density , @xmath68 interactions are not an effective radiative process .",
    "for this reason , the most energetic protons ( @xmath75 ) can reach the cloud via diffusion before being advected away from the bow - shock region . inside the cloud ,",
    "the relativistic protons lose energy via @xmath68 collisions , yielding ( absorbed ) @xmath0-ray luminosities @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78  erg  s@xmath2 for the cases 0 , i and ii , respectively .",
    "case ii is an interesting one since radiation above 100  tev may be detectable .",
    "we note that secondary leptons and neutrinos with luminosities similar to those of @xmath0-rays , would be also produced inside the cloud due to @xmath68 interactions , and their study will be carried out in future work .",
    "the relation flux / luminosity / distance : @xmath79  erg  s@xmath2  @xmath80 , and the luminosity values given above , show that one - cloud / jet interaction fluxes predicted in the present contribution could be detectable at x- or @xmath0-rays up to distances of @xmath81  mpc .",
    "the interaction of a cloud at the adopted @xmath22 could lead either to persistent but variable emission if there were many clouds interacting with the jet [ ] , or to sporadic emission with a certain duty cycle if clouds interact with the jet from time to time .",
    "for the parameters adopted here , the jet - cloud interaction would be a persistent activity if the number of clouds is @xmath82 ( for an fr  ii and assuming a life time of a cloud in the jet of @xmath83 ) , and sporadic if @xmath84 is smaller . in the former case ,",
    "the actual luminosities should be obtained here multiplying by @xmath85 , and in the latter , the interaction duty cycle would be proportional to @xmath86% . notice that at larger @xmath22 , the emission will be reduced even if a larger number of clouds could penetrate the jet , given the smaller cloud to jet section ratio .",
    "finally , we remain that given the properties of the emitter , the jet - cloud interaction radiation is not beamed and almost isotropic .",
