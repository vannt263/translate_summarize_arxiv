    "however , much of the internal motion of a molecule is largely unimportant in understanding many dynamical properties of condensed phase systems on long time scales . as the efficiency of an event - driven simulation depends critically on the number of events to process per unit of simulation time , a great deal of computational effort in simulations of large molecular systems is devoted to treating essentially unimportant internal motion of molecules , potentially limiting the scope of the simulation .",

    "]    given the complexity of constructing an event - driven simulation for rigid systems , it is natural to wonder whether it is worthwhile to carry out such calculations .",
    "such concerns can only be addressed by considering the relative efficiency of event - driven versus standard simulations as a function of the system size and of the physical conditions of the simulation . in order to assess the relative computational efficiency of the dmd simulation , the cpu time needed to simulate one picosecond of real time dynamics",
    "was assessed for the dmd and continuous - potential models for different system sizes and densities .",
    "of course , such a comparison depends sensitively on a number of factors that have little to do with the methods themselves , such as the choice of programming language , computer architecture , compiler choice and degree of compiler optimization . in order to minimize such external effects ,",

    "was written in c. both codes were compiled with the same compiler , on the same computer cluster , and with the same non - specialized level of optimization . since object - oriented code in c++",
    "is generally considered to be less efficient than c because of the additional overhead of utilizing classes , it is likely that optimizations in coding style and changing the coding language to c would enhance the relative efficiency of the dmd code reported here .    .",
    "the dots correspond to the dmd results and the open squares correspond to the continuous md simulation .",
    "the insert shows the ratio md / dmd of the cpu time values as a function of system size . ]",
    "it is also clear that the efficiency of a continuous md simulation is largely dependent on the size of the time step chosen to integrate the equations of motion , i.e. , the larger the time step the more rapidly the simulation propagates the system .",
    "however , a large integration time step leads to numerical instabilities in the md trajectory , something that can only be tolerated with an extensive use of thermostats .",
    "the use of thermostated dynamics has its own limitations since it artificially biases the `` true '' dynamics and influences the calculation of dynamical properties .",
    "the effect on the dynamics of thermostats is generally unknown , and hence artificial means of stabilizing trajectories must be handled with great care when looking at time dependent phenomena . in our simulations , the time step was chosen so that the effect of thermostatting the system was not evident in any of the dynamical correlation functions examined .",
    "this procedure resulted in a time step of @xmath122 for the low density runs and @xmath123 for the high density simulations of the continuous - potential system .",
    "the efficiency of the simulations in the discontinuous model depends on the grid time interval used in the root search , and here a value of @xmath124  fs was used for all simulations . in general",
    ", one can use the angular velocities of the colliding molecules to extract an average oscillation frequency of the collision indicator function and estimate the appropriate grid time interval for the simulation@xcite from this information .",
    "in such an approach , the angular velocities , and hence the value of the grid interval , vary with temperature in much the same way that the optimum time step value changes in a continuous md simulation with temperature .",
    "instead , we have chosen to use @xmath125 as the energy unit in the simulation so that the average angular velocities in the body frame have the same numerical value regardless of the temperature .",
    "this approach has the benefit that the numerical value for the optimal grid time interval is also independent of the temperature .",
    "figure  [ efficiency - ld ] shows the cpu time in seconds required by the two methods to simulate 1 ps of real time dynamics for the low density system as a function of the number of molecules .",
    "note that the the discontinuous method is faster than the md simulation by two orders of magnitude for all system sizes .",
    "this result is understandable on the basis that the dynamics in a low density system is dominated by free molecular motion which , as discussed earlier , can be integrated and propagated with large `` finite '' time steps .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the ordinary md method in which an ( ideally infinitesimally ) small time step must be utilized in order to numerically integrate the dynamics and conserve energy .",
    "we also observe in fig .",
    "[ efficiency - ld ] that both methods scale linearly with system size due to the use of cell lists and a cut off interaction distance in the continuous model .",
    "figure  [ efficiency - hd ] shows the cpu time needed by the dmd and md methods to carry out 1 picosecond of real time dynamics for the denser system at @xmath126 . the insert shows the cpu time ratio md / dmd and indicates that , even at this density , the dmd method is more than 2 times more efficient than the continuous md method .    one clear disadvantage of performing dmd simulations on rigid bodies as opposed to simple hard spheres is the necessity to find collision times using numerical root - search methods .",
    "the evaluation of distances between possibly interacting atoms is computationally costly , and is often the most demanding task in a dmd simulation of rigid systems . to reduce the computational work of finding collision times , it is convenient to truncate the numerical search of collisions that extend beyond a certain maximum time interval , which will be called the _ search interval _ , since events far in the future are not likely to be executed . to implement a truncation scheme ,",
    "collisions found in the search interval are scheduled as such , while a truncated search is scheduled as a",
    "_ virtual collision _",
    "( see ref .  ) .",
    "if the molecules for which the search for a collision event was truncated do not have an event over the previously searched interval , a virtual collision event is executed for the pair in which the root search is continued from where it was previously stopped . in this way , the numerical effort is primarily focused on the most likely events ( i.e. the ones happening within the search interval ) and the number of grid evaluations in which the cartesian positions and the distances between all atoms in the pair of molecules are calculated , is diminished .",
    "even though the truncation of the numerical search for collision events reduces the computational load of this type of event , the introduction of new events increases the size and complexity of the binary tree used to manage events . as a result ,",
    "the scheduling of new events , which typically scales as @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the number of events in the tree , becomes more demanding .",
    "since the computational effort associated with the data management increases while the effort of finding collisions decreases , the optimal size of the time interval for the virtual collisions is a function of the size of the tree , and hence the overall size of the system .",
    "if the search interval is very large , very few virtual collisions are scheduled and the efficiency of the simulation converges to that of a simulation that does not include virtual collision events .",
    "[ vircoll ] shows the relative gain in efficiency due to the use of virtual collision events for the systems consisting of 1000 , 3375 and 8000 molecules as a function of the maximum number of evaluations of the collision function in the search interval .",
    "clearly , the use of virtual collision increases as this ratio is decreased . for the system with 1000 molecules , an intensive use of virtual collisions ( i.e. one or two grid evaluations ) doubles the computational efficiency with respect to a simulation not utilizing these events .",
    "smaller systems ( not shown ) exhibit the same trend and have similar relative efficiencies . for a very large system , however , the gain in efficiency is smaller due to the fact that a large binary tree slows down the processing of events . indeed , for the system with 8000 molecules , it is more efficient to limit the number of virtual collisions scheduled by extending the search up to two or three grid evaluations instead of performing a single grid evaluation per root search .",
    "the effect of the increased load in data management can be clearly seen as the system size increases .",
    "nonetheless , the scheduling of truncated root searches leads to significant improvements in simulation efficiency for all system sizes examined where the numerical search for collision times , as opposed to data management , represent the bulk of the computational work in the simulation .",
    "the methane system considered in the previous section has particularly simple rotational dynamics due to the high degree of symmetry of the methane molecule",

    "allows simulations of rigid molecules with arbitrary mass distribution to be performed .",

    "there are a total of 13 relevant sites in every molecule ; the center of mass , six carbon sites , and six proton sites , where all atoms lie in a single plane with the carbon sites forming a closed ring . however using a _ united atom _ approach , in which every carbon - hydrogen pair is represented as a unique site",

    "if the radial distance from the center of mass to each united `` carbon '' atom in the plane of the molecule ( taken to be the @xmath129 plane ) is @xmath0 and the mass of the united atoms is set to @xmath130 , then one finds that the principal moments of inertia are @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "typically , the intermolecular interactions between the united atoms in benzene are assumed to be of lennard - jones form , leading to an interaction energy that depends strongly on the relative orientations of the interacting molecules .",

    "in contrast , the repulsive energy in the continuous model increases up to a maximum where the distance between united - carbon atoms on the two molecules is minimized .",

    "of course , the magnitude of the gain in relative efficiency depends on a number of factors , such as the level of detail in constructing a discontinuous potential model of the system , the system size , and physical parameters such as the density .",
