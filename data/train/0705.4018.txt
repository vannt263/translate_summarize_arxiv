    "recent identification of potential quantum computer ( qc ) architectures @xcite with long external decoherence times has shifted attention toward the negative effects of static internal structural flaws @xcite .",
    "isolated flawed qcs and their immediate local environments can in many cases be mapped onto self - interacting spin - bath models , and as a consequence spin baths are increasingly a focus of attention @xcite .",
    "studies have reported a number of interesting dynamical effects such as suppression of decoherence with increasing bath self - interaction @xcite , and large coherent shifting of subsystem dynamics @xcite .    here",
    "we show that the coherent shift can be used to configure a single qubit detector to measure the strength of bath self - interactions .",
    "structural flaws in a qc arise due to variance in one - body parameters or as a consequence of residual two - body interactions , or even as a result of strong interactions with other local impurities .",
    "one body flaws can be readily detected and corrected in many cases .",
    "two - body interactions are more difficult to deal with and their effects are difficult to predict .",
    "knowledge of the strength of the two - body interactions is obviously a prerequisite for eliminating their effects .",
    "it has been observed that the coherent shift is sensitive to the strength of bath self - interaction @xcite .",
    "we show that a single qubit can be configured to show large amplitude oscillations in fidelity when a shift is present , and that the period of the oscillations is highly sensitive to the strength of the bath self - interaction . from the period of the oscillation",
    "one can extract a quantitative estimate of the self - interaction strength . while we are not aware of any existing error correction schemes designed specifically for two - body flaws one should be simple to devise .",
    "moreover , it should be possible to apply the basic ideas behind our detector set - up in more general contexts such as optical impurities in solids where knowledge of bath self - interaction could be important .",
    "an engaging aspect of spin - bath models is the ease with which exact results can be obtained for the low temperature regime relevant to quantum computing .",
    "unfortunately , exact simulations are necessarily limited to small baths . in our study",
    "this limitation is not crucial but in more general studies it might be very important .",
    "consequently , we ideally would like to have a second independent way of obtaining open system dynamics .",
    "while uncoupled spin baths and uncoupled oscillator baths can display similar dynamics@xcite , standard boson - bath models@xcite are inapplicable here .",
    "this is due to the fact that the bath self - interactions are non - negligible in our model .",
    "we therefore choose to also consider simulations obtained using a recently developed approximate master equation ( me ) @xcite , which takes into account bath self - interactions via a mean - field approach .",
    "our qc model is based on a josephson junction ( jj ) based proposal @xcite which has an extremely long external decoherence time@xcite .",
    "recent experiments report @xcite that the primary cause of decoherence of such jj qubits is static interaction with some unidentified local two - level systems ( tlss ) @xcite . in one case @xcite",
    "externally induced rabi oscillations in a qubit were significantly distorted at times much shorter than the external decoherence time and the existence of the tlss was posited as the cause .",
    "our recent results @xcite suggest that the distortion might be caused by a coherent shift which could arise just from flaws and residual interactions amoung the qubits . in any case",
    "the possible tls can be viewed as distorted auxilliary qubits @xcite .",
    "the computer and tlss can be mapped onto a spin - bath and this is the model we address .",
    "we let one detector qubit interact with a statically flawed qc , and our goal is to show that the strength of the bath self - interaction can be measured .",
    "our system is thus a single two level system and our bath consists of flawed qubits and other interacting tlss .",
    "we prepare our detector in a superposition state which will merely undergo phase evolution in the absence of coherent shifting . when shifting is present",
    "the populations and fidelity oscillate .",
    "the strength of the bath self - interaction is extracted from the period of these oscillations .",
    "we use both exact and approximate master equation simulation methods .    while the phenomenology of decoherence and dissipation dominate the literature of open quantum systems@xcite the possible existence of coherent shifting has been acknowledged but not widely explored .",
    "combinations of observables like fidelity and purity can be used to distinguish these coherent sorts of errors from non - unitary effects like decoherence and dissipation @xcite .",
    "the effect of such a shift can be non - trivial and it can qualitatively alter the system evolution @xcite . in our detector ,",
    "for example , we will see that pure phase evolution is changed to large amplitude rabi oscillations .    distinguishing the unitary part of open system - dynamics from non - unitary parts is of particular importance , because unitary errors induced by the bath should be easily correctable .",
    "the exact nakajima - zwanzig me @xcite contains terms which result in both markovian and non - markovian distortions .",
    "the markovian term consists of hermitian corrections to the subsystem hamiltonian and clearly causes unitary errors .",
    "unfortunately , this markovian correction can not always be identified with the physical coherent shift .",
    "different choices for the projection operator @xcite lead to different markovian corrections .",
    "it is possible in principle that a specific projection operator will have the property that the markovian corrections are precisely equal to the physical shift @xcite .",
    "the identity of this projection operator is a matter of some interest since it is in a sense the most physical .",
    "furthermore , the form of the nakajima - zwanzig master equation @xcite which emerges from this choice of the projection operator would be a favorable starting point for subsequent approximations .",
    "a recently developed approximate me @xcite relies on a projection operator for which the unitary corrections consist of a shift @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the canonical average of the bath coupling operator @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the system coupling operator .",
    "the non - markovian terms are all non - unitary and so agreement of this me with exact calculations would strongly support this choice of the projection operator .",
    "we show that the predictions of the me are indeed quite good and hence that this the projection operator is the most physical .",
    "the accuracy of the me in this instance is of some interest since it also preserves positivity and has no adjustible parameters",

    "hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is a variant of an isolated flawed qc model recently introduced to investigate the effects of one - qubit static imperfections and two - qubit residual interactions on the performance of qcs@xcite .",
    "the actual internal dynamical effects have been explored @xcite and while decoherence and dissipation are present , the principle errors were caused by a coherent shift .    here",
    "qubit 0 will be employed as our detector while the rest represent some combination of flawed qubits and tlss .",

    "the parameters used in our numerical study are based on a josephson charge - qubit qc@xcite proposal for which the experimentally accessible single qubit energy to perform a one - qubit rotation is @xmath14 with @xmath15 mk . since all qubits in hamiltonian ( [ ham ]",
    ") can be viewed as components of the same qc , the fluctuations in single qubit parameters should only differ from @xmath16 by a detuning parameter , which we set to the value @xmath17 .",

    "while we considered a number of intra - bath coupling strengths @xmath25 in units of @xmath26 , to explore the integrable to chaotic transition , we considered only one system - bath coupling value , which corresponds to the experimental value for a two - qubit rotation , @xmath27 . in all our calculations temperature",
    "is kept constant at @xmath28 and time step of integration was @xmath29 s.    thus , the parameters are set so that all qubits are part of the same computer , but one qubit does not possess any one - body flaws and we use this as our detector .",
    "note also that in a multi - qubit jj qc , the existence of the aforementioned tlss is expected . in this study",
    ", we will not attempt to explicitly distinguish between qubits and tlss because the nature of the tlss is currently unknown and it is not possible to derive tls parameters from a first principle .",
    "nevertheless , the same form of pseudospin hamiltonian used for the qubits is also assumed for tlss @xcite and they both have comparable decoherence times @xcite .",
    "we assume that the initial state of the composite system is of product form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the initial pure reduced density of the system , and @xmath32 is the canonical bath density .",
    "we chose the system initial state as @xmath33 . in the absence of interactions with the bath this state of the detector",
    "will undergo phase evolution only .",
    "but rabi oscillations will appear when there are interactions with the bath .",
    "exact numerical solutions are obtained by exploiting the low temperature regime for the bath degrees of freedom .",
    "thus we approximate the initial bath density as @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the thermal populations , and @xmath36 .",
    "note that the sum is over only the thermally populated , lowest energy , eigenstates of the bath .",
    "hence , @xmath37 is a cutoff such that states @xmath38 and higher are unoccupied for our given fixed temperature . even though the density of bath states and thus the number of populated states varies slowly with @xmath39 for a fixed temperature , @xmath40 was sufficient for all cases in our calculations .",
    "we calculate the exact reduced density @xmath41 at time @xmath42 via @xmath43 here the @xmath44 evolve according to the schrdinger equation @xmath45 and all initial states are of the form @xmath46 .",

    "( [ se ] ) .    from the exact reduced density various measures ( discussed in section 5 ) can be calculated to determine the extent of decoherence , dissipation , and shifting .",
    "here we begin by reviewing the basic ideas behind the nakajima - zwanzig projection operator technique and show how it leads to an exact but unsolveable master equation .",

    "the properties of the resulting master equation will in part be determined by the choice of @xmath50 .",
    "in particular , it may be possible to choose a @xmath50 such that the non - markovian term generates non - unitary evolutions only . assuming that the system and thermal bath are initially uncorrelated ( i.e. @xmath57 ) and that the number of bath degrees of freedom is large enough so that the system does not significantly alter the equilibrium state of the bath , then the total density @xmath58 at time @xmath42 will be approximately given by @xmath59 .",
    "thus , it seems to make sense to define the projection operator @xmath50 via @xmath60 it should be noted that this was not the actual projection operator employed by zwanzig@xcite .",

    "this is obviously a consequence of the small bath size and the effect is not observed in the master equation results .",
    "agreement between the master equation and exact calculation clearly improves with increasing @xmath39 , and this is a consequence of the fact that the dynamics becomes more markovian with greater bath chaos .",
    "markovian character requires a separation of relaxation times for the system and bath degrees of freedom @xcite .",

    "this supports the conclusion that large coherent shifts are again occuring as they did in our previous study@xcite .",
    "this shift is clearly much more harmful than decoherence or dissipation as an potential error source for quantum computation @xcite .",
    "we will see that the coherent shifting can be put to a good purpose , however .",
    "it is also worth noting that while the coherent shift vanishes in some standard models of decoherence , it is nonzero in general for self - interacting baths . thus , we expect that shifts of this type and magnitude would also arise for solid state baths .",

    "( [ sra ] ) , should also grow .",
    "this is clearly in agreement with the trend in fig .",

    "2(a ) we see large rabi oscillations in the populations which are thus a direct consequence of coherent shifting .",
    "in addition , complete agreement between the master equation and exact numerical results is evident for populations ( see 3(a ) ) and phases ( see 3(b ) ) .",

    "this is true even in the integrable regime .",
    "small magnitude , high frequency , oscillations are still noticeable .",
    "however , the fidelity plot displays an additional long time , large amplitude , periodicity .",

    "there is again a discrepancy between the me and exact results in the integrable regime , but the agreement is excellent in the chaotic cases .    explaining the sensitivity of the fidelity period to @xmath39 is quite straightforward . neglecting the effects of decoherence and dissipation",
    "it can readily be argued that the shifted system dynamics should beat with a frequency of @xmath121 while the unperturbed system phase evolves with frequency @xmath122 . the period of rabi oscillations in fig .",

    "the large amplitude oscillations are caused by the fourth term , and they have period @xmath129 . generally , @xmath2 is much smaller than @xmath130 but @xmath2 increases with @xmath39 resulting in a shorter period .",

    "since @xmath128 varies more slowly with @xmath2 the rabi oscillations are not very sensitive to @xmath39 .",
    "thus , by measuring the period of the fidelity oscillation one can obtain an estimate of @xmath2 , and from fig .",
    "2(a ) we can then obtain the magnitude of @xmath39 .",
    "hence , we have a detector of the strength of bath self - interaction for this jj qc model .",
    "the same basic setup should also carry over to the case of oscillator baths , and the technique could potentially be used to measure the strength of anharmonic interactions in the solid state .",
    "we studied the decoherence dynamics of a central spin interacting with a self - interacting spin bath by exact numerical calculations and a master equation approach .",
    "we obtained good agreement between the two methods .",
    "the model represents a qubit detector interacting with an isolated flawed qc . in the absence of interactions with",
    "the qc the detector undergoes phase evolution only .",
    "when the detector experiences a coherent shift as a result of interaction with the qc it begins rabi oscillations .",
    "the fidelity also exhibits a periodicity on a much longer timescale with a period which is sensitive to the strength of bath self - interaction .",
    "measuring the period allows one to find the intra - bath coupling strength .",
    "the same approach could be used for measuring anharmonic interactions in more general contexts .",
