    "binary stars represent perhaps the most valuable targets for stellar astrophysics .",
    "they have been a source of insight into the structure and evolution of stars , theory of radiative transfer , stellar magneto- and hydrodynamics , and the newtonian theory of gravity , to mention just a few major topics ( shore 1994 ) .",
    "after discovery of the first binary pulsar 1913 + 16 , these objects have become excellent gravitational laboratories for testing general relativity by using radio observations ( taylor 1992 , 1994 ) .",
    "nevertheless , optical observations of binary stars continue to remain one of the most important sources of getting qualitatively new astronomical information .",
    "the reason is that the amount of binary stars observable at optical wavelenghts overwhelmingly exceeds the number of objects accessible for radio , x - ray , and/or @xmath3-ray observations .",
    "moreover , distribution of the relative orientation of binary orbits ranging from the edge - on to the face - on , allows one to obtain valuable information in studying different stellar phenomena .",
    "therefore , increasing accuracy of optical measurements of binary stars is a real challenge for modern astronomy .",
    "this is why precision doppler measurements of stellar spectra implemented recently for the search of extrasolar planets could open a new direction in binary star research .",
    "traditional techniques in radial velocity measurements rarely achieve an accuracy better than about 200 m s@xmath4 given such an uncertainty , usually the _ linear _ doppler effect , i.e. the term of order of only @xmath5 could be only measurable .",
    "its measurement for the primary star of mass @xmath6 belonging to a binary system brings five classical keplerian parameters of the stellar orbit .",
    "they are : projected semimajor axis @xmath7 eccentricity @xmath8 orbital period @xmath9 longitude of the periastron @xmath10 and the epoch @xmath11 of the initial periastron passage .",
    "combination of these parameters makes it possible to calculate the mass function for the binary system : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the companion mass , and @xmath2 is the inclination angle of the stellar orbit to the line of sight .",
    "obviously , the information which can be extracted from the linear doppler shift alone is incomplete to determine _ all _ orbital parameters of the binary , including the masses of its constituent stars .",
    "observations of additional relativistic effects are necessary .",
    "they include : relativistic advance of the periastron , quadratic doppler and gravitational redshifts , monotonous decrease of orbital period due to the emission of gravitational waves , and effects of deflection and retardation of electromagnetic waves in the companion s gravitational field .",
    "all of them have been observed in binary pulsars ( taylor 1992 ) but only relativistic advance of periastron could be measured with the use of conventional spectroscopic technique ( semeniuk & paczynski 1968 , guinan & maloney 1985 ) .    ozernoy ( 1997a , 1997b ) pointed out that current accuracy of precision doppler measurements ( pdms ) using the iodine - based doppler technique ( valenti , butler & marcy 1995 , cochran 1996 ) is able to catch the second - order in @xmath5 effects .",
    "moreover , he also has shown , by taking into account special relativity alone , that binary stars offer a unique opportunity to disentangle the linear and quadratic in @xmath5 terms and extract such an important parameter as inclination angle .    even without addressing any concrete applications ,",
    "a coherent , unambiguous interpretation of pdms having an accuracy of @xmath141 m s@xmath15 or better , requires an adequate development of a relativistic theory . by present , the basic principles to construct such a theory have been well established .",
    "recently , they have been worked out in a series of publications by brumberg & kopeikin ( 1989a , 1989b , 1990 ) ( bk approach ) and damour , soffel & xu ( 1991 , 1992 , 1993 ) ( dsx approach ) .",
    "the main idea is to introduce one global and several local coordinate charts in a gravitating system consisting of @xmath16 bodies to describe adequately the properties of space - time curvature both on the global scale and locally in the vicinity of each body .",
    "the subsequent application of the mathematical technique to match the asymptotic expansions of the metric tensor in different coordinate systems allows one to obtain general relativistic transformations between these systems , which generalize lorentz transformations of special relativity .",
    "practical conclusions of two approaches are the same . in this paper",
    ", we use the bk approach to describe self - consistently the relativistic algorithm of pdms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "seven appropriate coordinate frames are introduced .",
    "3 deals with the doppler effect in special relativity , which can be important for interpretation of pdms in the situations , when effects of the gravitational field are negligibly small .",
    "the post - newtonian coordinate transformations are sketched in section 4 , along with the derivation of the equation for propagation of photons in a gravitational field .",
    "the doppler effect in general relativity is explored in section 5 .",
    "parameterization of the doppler effect and the explicit doppler shift curve are given in section 6 .",
    "section 7 outlines some observational implications of the theory .",
    "finally , section 8 contains discussion and our conclusions .",
    "the approach developed in this paper was earlier reported in kopeikin & ozernoy ( 1996 ) .",
    "a rigorous mathematical treatment of precision doppler observations of a binary star requires the use of seven ( 4-dimensional ) reference frames ( rfs ) :    @xmath17 barycentric reference frame of our galaxy @xmath18    @xmath19 the solar system s barycentric reference frame @xmath20    @xmath21 the binary system s barycentric reference frame @xmath22    @xmath23 the star - centered reference frame denotes coordinate time in the star - centered reference frame and is not a wavelenght of photon . ]",
    "@xmath24    @xmath25 the earth s ( geocentric ) reference frame @xmath26    @xmath27 topocentric reference frame of terrestrial observer @xmath28    @xmath29 proper reference frame of a particle emitting light @xmath30here and hereinafter , the arrow above the letter denotes a spatial vector having three coordinates ; index  0 \" relates to time coordinate , and small latin indices ( such as @xmath31 ) represent the spatial coordinates .",
    "the origin of each coordinate frame coincides with the center of mass ( barycenter ) of the respected system of gravitating bodies .",
    "for instance , the origin of the solar system rf is at the center of mass of the solar system , the origin of the emitting star s rf is at the center of mass of the star , and so on .",
    "the observer is regarded to be massless and placed at the origin of the topocentric rf .",
    "we assume that emission of light is produced by the atom placed at the origin of its own proper rf @xmath32 .",
    "each rf has its own coordinate time .",
    "these times are related to each other by means of relativistic time transformations ( brumberg & kopeikin 1989a , 1989b , 1990 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the coordinate time of the topocentric rf coincides precisely with the proper time of the observer measured by the atomic clocks , and the coordinate time of the rf of the atom emitting light coincides with its proper time .",
    "the barycentric rf of our galaxy is considered to be asymptotically flat so that it covers all space - time .",
    "all other coordinate frames are not asymptotically flat , and they cover only restricted domains in space because of a non - zero space - time curvature . all coordinate systems are assumed to be nonrotating in the kinematical sense ( brumberg & kopeikin 1989a ) .",
    "it means that spatial axes of all rf s are aligned and anchored to the outermost quasars whose proper motions are negligibly small .",
    "to derive equations describing the doppler effect at the post - newtonian level of accuracy , we use the relativistic post - newtonian transformations between the coordinate frames .",
    "they have been formulated by kopeikin ( 1988 ) and brumberg & kopeikin ( 1989a , 1989b ) , and are discussed briefly in section 4 . however , for pedagogical reasons , it is useful to consider the doppler effect first in the framework of special relativity .",
    "the special relativistic approach is motivated by the fact that one can get the _",
    "exact _ treatment of the problem under consideration , which will provide a guide of consistency for general relativistic calculations .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the special relativistic approach is not able to take into account the relativistic effects asssociated with an accelerated motion of bodies as well as influence of gravitational field .",
    "those efffects can be adequately considered only in framework of general relativity .",
    "the doppler effect in special relativity is usually considered only for two rfs : one is assumed to be at rest , and the other moves with respect to the first one with a constant velocity .",
    "here we discuss a more realistic situation when five coordinate systems @xmath33 and @xmath34 , introduced in the previous section , need to be considered .",
    "this situation is rather close to the real astronomical practices and it might be applied to the interpretation of spectral observations of binary stars if the influence of gravitational fields could be neglected . in this section ,",
    "we abandon , for the sake of simplicity , the reference frames @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the reason is that , for the moment , we want to avoid the discussion of terms caused by the motion of the solar and binary systems about the center of our galaxy , as well as motions of the emitting particles with respect to the star .",
    "accounting for these effects will be done in later sections .",
    "the rf @xmath37 is the basic one which is considered to be at rest .",
    "the origins of the rfs @xmath38 and @xmath39 are moving with respect to @xmath37 with constant relative velocities @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively@xmath42 the rf @xmath39 is supposed to move with respect to the @xmath38 with a constant relative velocity @xmath43 note that , in the relativistic approach , @xmath44 the rfs @xmath45 and @xmath34 move with constant velocities @xmath46 and @xmath47 with respect to @xmath48 the relative velocity of the reference frame @xmath34 with respect to @xmath45 is @xmath49 ( again , @xmath50 @xmath51    three different approaches for discussion of doppler effect can be applied .",
    "they are based , accordingly , on the techniques of relativistic frequency transformation ( landau & lifshitz 1951 ) , successive lorentz transformations ( weinberg 1972 ) , and time transformations along with the equation of light propagation ( tolman 1934 , brumberg 1972 ) .",
    "let @xmath52 be the 4-vector of the electromagnetic wave propagating from the source of light to the observer . here and",
    "hereinafter , greek indices run from 0 to 3 , i.e. @xmath53 this is a null vector in the flat space - time .",
    "therefore , @xmath54 and @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the frequency of the electromagnetic wave and the unit spatial vector @xmath57 is tangent to the trajectory of the light ray . for convenience",
    ", it is chosen to be directed from the observer toward the point of emission .",
    "let @xmath58 be the vector of 4-velocity of a massive particle .",
    "the time component is @xmath59 and the spatial components are @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the ( constant ) lorentz - factor , @xmath62 and @xmath63 is a spatial velocity of the particle@xmath42 by contracting vectors @xmath64 and @xmath65 , one forms a scalar which is relativistically invariant as it is independent of the choice of reference frame : @xmath66 where the repeated spatial indices mean a summation from 1 to 3 .",
    "suppose that the source of light moves with respect to the observer with a constant speed @xmath67 the 4-velocity of the observer in its proper rf is defined as @xmath68 and the 4-velocity of the source of light is @xmath69 let the frequency of the emitted electromagnetic wave be @xmath70 and the received frequency be @xmath71 then , by applying equation ( [ a0 ] ) to the two different rf s one gets ( boldface letters denote spatial vectors , and the dot in between two spatial vectors stands for usual scalar product ) : @xmath72 which is a well - known result ( landau & lifshitz 1951 ) for the doppler shift of the frequency of light emitted by a moving source and received by the observer at rest . here",
    "the unit spatial vector @xmath73 is measured with respect to the observer s rf .    while applying this formula , we will use slightly different notations : @xmath74 for the frequency of the emitted light and @xmath56 for the observed frequency , viz . , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 for the frequencies of light observed in reference frames @xmath77 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "let us also introduce a fractional frequency shift function , @xmath78 .",
    "succesive application of equation ( [ a1 ] ) yields @xmath79 here @xmath80 is the spatial unit vector tangent to the light ray and having components measured with respect to the coordinate system @xmath37 , and @xmath81 and @xmath82 represent the same tangent vector with the components measured relative to the systems @xmath38 and @xmath45 , respectively . equation ( [ a2 ] ) contains the dimensionless particle velocities @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 . coordinates with the asterisk concern the point of emission of light , and coordinates without asterisk",
    "are related to the point of observation .",
    "it is worth noting that the components of vectors @xmath87 and @xmath88 do not coincide with those of vector @xmath89 because of the relativistic aberration of light .",
    "a remarkable feature of the formula ( [ a2 ] ) is that it represents the doppler effect as a product of four different multipliers .",
    "each factor describes transformation of frequency of light from one reference frame to another",
    ". it would be straightforward to generalize this result for the description of the doppler effect in the event of as many reference frames as necessary .",
    "because of importance of equation ( [ a2 ] ) , it is instructive to derive it by using different techniques and then to compare the results .",
    "lorentz transformations from the reference frame @xmath37 to @xmath38 is described by the matrix @xmath90 with the components ( weinberg 1972 , brumberg 1972 , 1991 ) : @xmath91 similarly , the lorentz transformation from the reference frame @xmath38 to @xmath39 is described by the matrix @xmath92 with the components : @xmath93 the lorentz transformations from the reference frame @xmath37 to @xmath94 and from @xmath45 to @xmath34 are given respectively by the matrices @xmath95 and @xmath96with the components : @xmath97 @xmath98 the relationship between time components of a light ray s 4-vector is given by the successive lorentz transformations ( the repeated greek indices imply summation from 0 to 3 ) : @xmath99 @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are components of the light ray vector referred to the rf s @xmath103 and @xmath34 , respectively@xmath42    by substituting the matrices of the lorentz transformations into equations ( [ a6]),([a7 ] ) and defining the null vector @xmath104 , we obtain after straightforward calculations the following result : @xmath105 at first sight , it looks quite different compared to equation ( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "however , by making relativistic transformation of vectors @xmath88 and @xmath87 to vector @xmath89 in equation ( [ a2 ] ) , one can readily show that both expressions are completely identical . in the rest of thid section ,",
    "we derive , for the reader s convenience , the transformation law between vectors @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",

    "this can be seen from the relativistic law of addition of velocities ( weinberg 1972 , brumberg 1972 , 1991 ) . in case under consideration ,",
    "it is given by : @xmath120 , \\ ] ] where @xmath63 and @xmath121 are the relative velocities of a particle with respect to rfs @xmath45 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "for the light particle ( photon ) these velocities are @xmath122 and @xmath123 having substituted them to eq .",
    "( [ ap7 ] ) , one obviously gets eq .",
    "( [ ap6 ] ) .",
    "finally , using equations ( [ ap5 ] ) - ( [ ap7 ] ) , one obtains : @xmath124 one can see from equation ( [ ap9 ] ) and a similar expression for @xmath125 that equations ( [ a2 ] ) and ( [ a8 ] ) are identical . the advantage of eq .",
    "( [ a8 ] ) over ( [ a2 ] ) is that only one vector @xmath89 enters eq .",
    "( [ a8 ] ) , instead of three vectors @xmath126 and @xmath89 in eq .",
    "( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "previous techniques used to derive the doppler equation have not taken into account an essential fact of separation of the two events  emission and observation of light  in space - time .",
    "in fact , we have implicitly assumed that the null vector @xmath64 is the same at the points of emission and observation of light .",
    "however , this is only true for a very special case of negligent gravitational field and propagation of light in vacuum . in general , this conditions are not met .",
    "therefore , a more advanced technique is required to tackle the doppler effect appropriately .",
    "such a technique , based on the integration of the equation for light propagation from the point of emission to the point of observation , establishes a relationship between coordinates of the 4-vector of a photon at these two events .",
    "transformation laws of time scales between different rfs are to be taken into account as well .",
    "this approach , being rather general and straightforward , can be applied to analyse any particular situation . in this section ,",
    "we consider time transformation technique in special relativity only .",
    "its application to observations of binary stars in the framework of general relativity will be discussed in later sections .",
    "the equation of light propagation , in the absence of gravitational field and interstellar medium , is quite simple : @xmath127 @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the instant of photon emission and @xmath130 is the instant of observation of the photon , both measured as coordinate time of rf @xmath37 , in which @xmath131 is the point of emission , and @xmath132 is the point of observation .",
    "it is worth noting that , although the instants @xmath130 and @xmath133 belong to the same rf @xmath37 , their increments @xmath134 and @xmath135 are different because of a relative motion of the source of light and the observer .",
    "one can see from equation ( [ a9 ] ) that when the influences of gravitational field and the medium are both negligent , the components of the vector @xmath64 are constant everywhere on the light ray s trajectory .",
    "this makes clear why we do not care about a point in space - time in which earlier we calculated the doppler shift .",
    "however , in a more general situation , the equations ( [ a9 ] ) , ( [ d ] ) are not so simple , and this point has to be appropriately taken into consideration .",
    "doppler effect is described by the function @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the frequency of the emitted light , and @xmath138 is the observed frequency . by taking the time intervals to be infinitesimally small ,",
    "we get a differential formula : @xmath139 which is nothing more but a simple rule for differentiation of an hierarchical function @xmath140 this result demonstrates as well that the doppler effect can be presented as a product of several multiplyers .",
    "a difference between equations ( [ e ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) is that in ( [ e ] ) we use coordinate times of the respected rfs and distinguish explicitly the points of emission and observation of light .",
    "meanwhile in equation ( [ a2 ] ) only proper frequencies of the electromagnetic wave are considered . the advantage of eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) is that , for its derivation , one needs to know only relativistic transformations between time scales , whereas transformation law between spatial coordinates is not required .",
    "as we shall see later on , this advantage is very helpful while tackling the doppler effect in general relativity .    to calculate the time derivatives at the points of emission and observation",
    ", one needs incorporating time components of the lorentz transformations ( [ a3 ] ) - ( [ a5a ] ) between different rfs .",
    "they are : @xmath141 @xmath142 @xmath143 @xmath144    let us remind that observer is fixed with respect to the rf @xmath34 , and the source of light is fixed with respect to @xmath145 therefore , @xmath146 and @xmath147 velocities of the observer and the source of light relative to the rf @xmath37 are @xmath148 and @xmath149 , respectively ( it is important to note that @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "therefore one obtains from ( [ a ] ) - ( [ c1 ] ) : @xmath152 @xmath153 @xmath154 @xmath155 in addition , differentiation of equation ( [ d ] ) gives : @xmath156 substitution of expressions ( [ f ] ) - ( [ i ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) gives for the doppler shift : @xmath157 this equation does not coincide apparently neither with ( [ a2 ] ) , nor with ( [ a8 ] ) .",
    "nethertheless , taking into account relativistic transformations between vectors @xmath88 , @xmath158 , and @xmath89 as well as the law of addition of spatial velocities one can readily show that all three expressions for the doppler effect are identical . indeed , with the use of equation ( [ ap7 ] ) it follows that @xmath159 and @xmath160 these relationships , along with ones obtained from ( [ ap8 ] ) - ( [ ap10 ] ) after replacement of indices @xmath34 to @xmath39 and @xmath45 to @xmath38 , allow to see that expression ( [ k ] ) for the doppler effect coincides with ( [ a8 ] ) and , consequently , with ( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "this completes the derivation of the exact equations for the doppler effect in special relativity .",
    "these equations could be expanded into powers of @xmath161 to get an approximate solution .",
    "unfortunately , we would not be able to apply directly those expressions to real astronomical practices since gravitational fields of the solar system , the binary system , and the galaxy give contributions comparable with the special relativistic quadratic doppler shift .",
    "thus , in order to explore the doppler effect in general relativity , it is important to elaborate approximative analytical methods . to tackle this problem",
    ", we apply the relativistic theory of astronomical reference frames developed by kopeikin ( 1988 ) and brumberg & kopeikin ( 1989a , 1989b ) .",
    "transformation laws between reference frames in general relativity generalize the lorentz transformations of special relativity .",
    "they can be derived in two steps .",
    "first of all , the explicit form of metric tensor in different rfs are obtained by solving the einstein equations with relevant boundary conditions .",
    "then , the general relativistic transformations between the rfs are derived using the method of matched asymptotic technique .",
    "a clear and simple introduction to this technique is given in brumberg & kopeikin ( 1990 ) .",
    "here we give the transformation laws in the form which is suitable for discussion of the doppler effect with a more than sufficient accuracy .",
    "to derive the doppler shift , we apply the technique based on time transformations ( sec .",
    "thus , there is no need for development of relativistic part of space - time transformation between spatial coordinates , which will be given hereinafter only in the newtonian approximation .",

    "presence of periodically changing terms in equation ( 76 ) enables us disentangling different terms and measuring , along with the well known keplerian parameters of the binary , four additional post - keplerian parameters ( @xmath443 and @xmath444 ) as well .",
    "the first three of them are given by equations ( 92 ) , ( 101 ) , and ( 103 ) , respectively .",
    "the @xmath179 parameter characterizes the relativistic advance of the periastron ; @xmath450 characterizes the quadratic doppler and gravitational shifts associated with the orbital motion of the primary relative to the binary s barycentre and with the companion s gravitational field , respectively ; @xmath451 characterizes the amplitude of the ` gravitational lensing ' contribution to the doppler shift given by equation ( 102 ) ; and @xmath2 is the usual inclination angle of the binary s orbit ( the value of @xmath2 defines the shape of the ` gravitational lensing ' term ) .",
    "the post - keplerian parameters @xmath443 and @xmath444 can be measured in binary systems , which are sufficiently close so as to make the relativistic effects measurable ( on the other hand , as discussed below , for too close binaries with very short periods and therefore with very high orbital velocities there is a potential problem with the determination of the exposure mid - time while performing pdms ) .",
    "feasibility of practical implementation of the theory developed in this paper , crucially depends on further progress in pdm techniques .",
    "analyzing the spectrum of a star with respect to the ` velocity metric ' based on the spectrum of the iodine absorption cell allows one to remove most of the wavelength drifts of the spectrograph and the detector .",
    "it can provide an ultimate precision in measuring radial velocity of a star attaining 1 m s@xmath452 or better ( cochran 1996 ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare this precision with that in millisecond pulsars timing technique .",
    "available data indicate that the limiting accuracy of pulsar timing measurements , @xmath453 with present techniques is a few microseconds , or less , over timespan of many years ( taylor 1992 ) .",
    "uncertainty in the velocity measurement is the product of radial acceleration of the body under consideration and the error in timing measurement .",
    "the star s radial acceleration with respect to the binary s barycentre is proportional to @xmath454 where @xmath455 is the radial component of orbital velocity , @xmath214 is the semimajor axis of the star s orbit , and @xmath2 is inclination angle of the orbit .",
    "thus , for the typical binary pulsar psr b1913 + 16 , where @xmath456 @xmath457s , @xmath458 s , and the ratio @xmath5 @xmath45910@xmath460 one gets the precision of timing velocity measurements @xmath461 @xmath462 m s@xmath4 thus , the pdms of binary stars based on iodine absorption cell technique can not currently be considered competitive with timing technique for binary pulsars as concerned the precise tests of relativistic gravity .",
    "nevertheless , relative accuracy of pdms ( @xmath463 ) is comparable with the magnitude of the second or ( in some cases ) even third order for relativistic perturbations in binary systems .",
    "therefore , implementation of relativistic theory for proper tackling with such precision measurements is inevitable .",
    "the prospects for pdms combined with the relativistic theory of doppler shift presented above seem to be even more bright if one takes into consideration that a new generation of instruments for pdms is currently emerging . among them",
    "is the use of fourier transform spectroscopy with the navy prototype optical spectrometer being built by the u.s .",
    "naval observatory ( armstrong et al . 1998 ) , which is projected to achieve in a near future a velocity resolution of only 0.3 m / s ( hajian 1998 ) .",
    "an accuracy with which the orbital parameters of a binary can be determined by applying the pdms is restricted by an uncertainty related to the determination of the exposure mid - time .",
    "it is interesting to compare pdms with pulsar timing where one can actually measure the arrival time of signals and not only the dopler shift .",
    "this allows a phase - connected solution for astrometric , spin , and orbital parameters of the pulsar which contains a fit to integer numbers .",
    "that is the reason for the high accuracy in pulsar timing experiment .",
    "more simply , the precision , with which the position of a pulsar on its orbit can be determined , is given by a relationship @xmath464 .",
    "let us assume , for convenience , that pdm gives an infinite precision in determination of stellar velocity but the exposure mid - time is determined with an error @xmath465 , which is about 1 s ( cochran 1996)@xmath42 then inaccuracy in determination of the star s orbital position is given by @xmath466 @xmath467 .",
    "a comparision of the two expressions above gives : @xmath468 where @xmath469 for binary systems having orbital parameters like those in psr 1913 + 16 with @xmath470 and @xmath471 @xmath457s one has @xmath472 km .",
    "however , it is worth emphasizing that since the accuracy of timing measurements has a low limit about 1 @xmath457s one can achieve a better determination of the orbits of binary systems in which @xmath473 i.e. for the systems with very long orbital periods . in this sense ,",
    "pdms are much better suited to search for planets orbiting the extrasolar stars than pulsar timing .    in this paper",
    ", we have only considered the post - newtonian theory for pdms of binaries consisting of a primary ( optical ) star and an ( invisible ) compact companion .",
    "although in many binaries , especially spectroscopic ones , measuring the doppler effect for both stars would provide additional possibilities for disentangling the orbital parameters , this kind of binary seems to be less appropriate for pdm measurements .",
    "indeed , in close binaries , where relativistic effects could be measurable with pdms , those effects would be severely contaminated by tidal interaction of the components and stellar winds , whereas in wide binaries the post - newtonian terms are expected to be rather weak .",
    "it is worthwhile to remind that normal stars subjected to the pdms , in most cases , can not be considered as point masses , unlike neutron stars or black holes .",
    "due to this reason , the classical perturbations will presumably be the most important sources of orbital parameters variations ( shore 1994 ) .",
    "however , even in the situation when the classical perturbations dominate , measuring of ( or proper taking into account ) the relativistic effects will serve as a tool to better understand the nature of the process(es ) responsible for the orbital parameters variations . in this respect , interesting observational targets for pdms might be massive main - sequence stars with radio pulsars in binary systems like psr b1259 - 63 ( wex et al .",
    "1988 ) or psr j0045 - 7319 .",
    "timing observations reveal ( lai , bildstein & kaspi 1995 ) that it is possible to measure orbital evolution caused by hydrodynamical effects associated with the optical companion but induced by the tidal gravitational field of the companion ( the pulsar ) and/or intrinsic rotational motion of the primary star .",
    "pdms of such a system , to be done complementary to timing observations , would allow to measure tidal oscillations of the optical star and therefore to essentially improve our knowledge about these systems .",
    "another interesting application of pdms could be an anomalous binary systems like di her , where some discrepancy was found between the prediction based on general relativity and the observed motion of the periastron ( guinan & maloney 1985 ) .",
    "it also can be explained by the dynamical influence of tidally - generated oscillations on the orbital motion of stars but accuracy of the employed observational technique was not good enough to test this hypothesis .    .",
