    "a fractional quantum hall ( qh ) system of filling fraction @xmath3 has edge channels that support fractional charges obeying fractional braiding statistics  @xcite . at @xmath4",
    ", the edge states are decomposed into a @xmath5 charge mode and a counterpropagating neutral mode  @xcite .",
    "they originate from renormalization of two counterpropagating charge modes  @xcite , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and stabilize at low temperature under strong disorder .",
    "neutral modes have attracted much attention , as they are charge neutral and carry energy .",
    "they have been recently detected through shot noise measurements  @xcite , and their properties such as energy and decay length have been extensively studied  @xcite .    electron interaction is a dominant source of dephasing at low temperature  @xcite .",
    "it leads to electron fractionalization  @xcite in quantum wires ; an electron , injected into a wire , splits into constituents ( spin - charge separation , charge fractionalization ) , showing reduction of interference visibility or dephasing  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , when the wire is finite , the constituents recombine after bouncing at wire ends , resulting in coherence revival  @xcite .",
    "fractionalization was detected  @xcite in a non - chiral wire , and studied in the integer qh edge  @xcite .",
    "coherent transport , as well as dephasing , can be tackled through the study of low energy dynamics at the edge .",
    "this is particularly important in the context of the fractional qh regime .",
    "the present study implies that the presence of neutral modes could be a dominant source of dephasing .",
    "note that neutral modes have been observed in almost all fractional qh systems  @xcite . at the same time there is no uncontested observation of anyonic interference oscillations in the pure aharonov - bohm regime of a fractional qh interferometer .",
    "the present study of the @xmath4 qh regime emphasizes two dephasing mechanisms by fractionalization of an electron into charge and neutral components , _ plasmonic dephasing _ and _ topological dephasing_. concerning the plasmonic dephasing mechanism , the overlap between the plasmonic parts of the charge and neutral components decreases with time , as the two components propagate with different velocities in the opposite directions .",
    "the resulting dephasing is similar to the plasmonic dephasing that takes place in a quantum wire or in integer qh edges . on the other hand ,",
    "the topological dephasing is a new mechanism unnoticed so far .",
    "it occurs because the zero - mode parts of the components , satisfying fractional statistics , may braid with thermally excited anyons .",

    "@xmath23 is determined by the overlaps of the components of the same kind between two interfering paths of relative charge winding @xmath15 .",
    "we find two mechanisms suppressing @xmath24 , the plasmonic dephasing and the topological dephasing ; the former ( latter ) involves plasmon ( zero - mode ) parts of the components . in the plasmonic dephasing , @xmath23",
    "is contributed from the two interfering paths whose charge components overlap maximally between the paths .",
    "but , their neutral components overlap only partially between the interfering paths , reducing @xmath23 ; similar dephasing occurs in other fractionalizations  @xcite .",
    "the topological dephasing additionally occurs , but depending on @xmath15 , in contrast to the other known mechanisms .",
    "when @xmath25",
    "@xcite , the first harmonics @xmath26 is suppressed at @xmath27 ( namely , @xmath28 ) .",
    "it is because the charge component gains thermally fluctuating fractional braiding phase of @xmath29 ( leading to @xmath30 ) , while it winds once ( @xmath31 ) around @xmath32 electronic or anyonic thermal excitations on the qd edge or in the bulk .",
    "by contrast , the second harmonics @xmath33 is not affected by the topological dephasing ( as braiding phase @xmath34 and @xmath35 are trivial ) and dominates @xmath12 , resulting in @xmath2 ab oscillations .",

    "when an electron of a given energy enters the qd by the process of sequential tunneling , it occupies a certain orbital state of the qd edge , satisfying energy conservation . in the pure ab regime , the area enclosed by the orbit ( hence , the ab phase assigned to the orbit ) is not modified when the number of quasiparticles or electrons in the bulk of the qd fluctuates thermally : edge - bulk interactions are negligible .",

    "<S> we study dephasing in electron transport through a large quantum dot ( a fabry - perot interferometer ) in the fractional quantum hall regime with filling factor @xmath0 . in the regime of sequential </S>",
    "<S> tunneling , dephasing occurs due to electron fractionalization into counterpropagating charge and neutral edge modes on the dot . in particular , when the charge mode moves much faster than the neutral mode , and at temperatures higher than the level spacing of the dot , electron fractionalization combined with the fractional statistics of the charge mode leads to the dephasing selectively suppressing @xmath1 aharonov - bohm oscillations but not @xmath2 oscillations , resulting in oscillation - period halving . </S>"
