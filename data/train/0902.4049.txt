    "the harris - plischke - zuckermann model@xcite has long been used to study the effects of random uniaxial anisotropy on ferromagnetism .",
    "the hamiltonian of this random anisotropy model ( ram ) is @xmath9 where each @xmath10 , the dynamical on site @xmath11 , is usually taken to be a classical three - component spin of unit length .",
    "each @xmath12 is a time - independent unit vector .",
    "the @xmath13 on different sites are assumed to be uncorrelated random variables .",
    "@xmath14 is a sum over nearest neighbors on some lattice . in this work",
    "we will use a simple cubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions , and we will study the case of two - component ( @xmath15 ) spins .    as was discussed in some detail in an earlier paper,@xcite",
    "if one chooses the @xmath10 and the @xmath12 to be two - component vectors , then the hamiltonian can be mapped onto a model of a spin - density wave ( sdw ) in an anisotropic material with an easy axis . for @xmath0 spins , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath15 , the hamiltonian of the model may be rewritten as @xmath16   \\ , .\\ ] ] each @xmath17 is a dynamical variable which takes on values between 0 and @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath19 indicates here a sum over nearest neighbors on a simple cubic lattice of size @xmath1 .",
    "we choose each @xmath20 to be an independent identically distributed quenched random variable , with the probability distribution @xmath21 for @xmath22 between 0 and @xmath18 .",
    "a constant term has also been added to the anisotropy , to make the hamiltonian well - behaved in the limit @xmath23 .    in this work",
    "we will study eqn .  2 on the simple cubic lattice over a range of @xmath24 , using monte carlo simulations .",
    "the large increase in available computing resources over the last fifteen years makes possible significant improvements over the earlier results.@xcite by studying a range of @xmath2 , we will be able to learn about the stability of long - range order against random pinning which respects the kramers degeneracy , such as alloy disorder , and the critical behavior of a sdw in an easy - axis material with this type of pinning .",
    "in the limit @xmath23 , often called the ising limit , both analytical@xcite and numerical@xcite calculations become substantially simplified .",
    "this is due to the fact that in this ising limit the random anisotropy term in the hamiltonian becomes a projection operator , and each spin has only two allowed states .",
    "it has been argued that for large @xmath24 the behavior is close to the @xmath25 limit as long as @xmath26.@xcite it has also been found , however , that for @xmath15 at low temperatures and moderately large values of @xmath24 the magnetization per spin on @xmath1 simple cubic lattices , @xmath27 , decreases@xcite as the temperature , @xmath8 , is lowered .",
    "this effect was not seen for @xmath25 .",
    "a similar effect is seen in the case of the random bond ising model ( rbim ) , where the nishimori gauge symmetry causes the magnetization to have a maximum at a finite @xmath8 on the nishimori line.@xcite the rbim is the natural extension@xcite of the ram to the case of ising spins , @xmath28 . thus it should be expected that the phase diagram of the @xmath15 ram has a close relation to that of the rbim . however , there are aspects of the phase diagrams which remain somewhat mysterious .",
    "for example , chen and lubensky@xcite found that the critical exponents which describe the stability of the ferromagnet - spin glass - paramagnet multicritical point for the random bond model in @xmath29 dimensions are well - behaved for @xmath28 , but become complex for @xmath15 and @xmath30 .",
    "one interpretation of this puzzling result is that the multicritical point itself becomes unstable in @xmath29 dimensions , so that it becomes a region of the phase diagram , rather than a single point . in this expanded multicritical region",
    "one might expect to find quasi - long - range order ( qlro ) .",
    "although an explicit calculation has not been done , a similar result would not be surprising for the ram .",
    "the existence of qlro in the ram was first suggested by aharony and pytte@xcite in 1980 .",
    "they later@xcite pointed out that higher order terms might make the correlation length , @xmath31 , finite below @xmath5 .",
    "feldman@xcite has argued that qlro should be common in disordered magnets and similar systems .",
    "thus there are a number of possibilities available for the topology of the phase diagram . in a cayley - tree mean - field theory , where qlro does not occur , it is known@xcite that in the limit @xmath32 the phase diagram depends on the parameter @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the number of nearest neighbor spins .",
    "thus it is to be expected that the phase diagram in three dimensions will also depend on the lattice type , @xmath35 and the range of the exchange interactions , as well as on @xmath36 and @xmath24 . for the simple cubic lattice ( which has @xmath37 ) it has been shown@xcite that in the limit @xmath32",
    "the ground state is an ising spin glass when @xmath38 . for small @xmath24",
    ", however , where one does not expect the qualitative behavior to depend on @xmath34 , feldman@xcite predicts qlro in @xmath39 for @xmath40 . in the @xmath30 case , this appears to be confirmed by monte carlo calculations.@xcite    the presence of a reentrant phase is difficult to demonstrate conclusively using the type of numerical calculations we have performed here .",
    "it was only relatively recently that reentrance was demonstrated convincingly in the @xmath41 rbim.@xcite there may also be a range of @xmath24 for which the three - dimensional @xmath15 model has a reentrant ferromagnetic phase .",
    "one motivation for believing this is that reentrance is frequently observed in laboratory experiments .",
    "another is the work of pelcovits , pytte and rudnick@xcite who argue that ferromagnetism should be unstable in the ram for low @xmath8 and small @xmath24 .",
    "since magnetization can increase with increasing @xmath8 at low @xmath8 , ( which was not known at the time of their work , ) it is not correct to claim that the absence of ferromagnetism near @xmath42 precludes the existence of a ferromagnetic phase in the ram at a somewhat higher @xmath8 .",
    "larkin@xcite studied a model for a vortex lattice in a type - ii superconductor .",
    "his model replaces the spin - exchange term of the hamiltonian with a harmonic potential , so that each @xmath17 is no longer restricted to lie in a compact interval .",
    "he argued that for any non - zero value of a random field this model has no long - range order on a lattice whose dimension @xmath43 is less than or equal to four .",
    "this argument , using the harmonic potential instead of the spin - exchange , is only rigorously correct in the limit @xmath44 .",
    "a more intuitive derivation of the result was given by imry and ma,@xcite who assumed that the increase in the energy of an @xmath45 lattice when the order parameter is twisted at a boundary scales as @xmath46 , just as it does in the nonrandom ferromagnet .",
    "as argued by imry and ma,@xcite and later justified more carefully,@xcite within an @xmath47-expansion one finds the phenomenon of  dimensional reduction \" . within this perturbation theory the critical exponents of any @xmath43-dimensional @xmath48 random - field model ( rfm )",
    "( for which the kramers degeneracy is broken by the randomness ) appear to be identical to those of an ordinary @xmath48 model of dimension @xmath49 . for the ising ( @xmath28 )",
    "case , this dimensional reduction was shown rigorously to be incorrect.@xcite another interesting development was the calculation of mezard and young,@xcite who showed that random fields caused breaking of replica symmetry below @xmath5 for any finite value of @xmath35 .",
    "thus there is no good reason to expect that dimensional reduction should be correct near @xmath5 for any finite value of @xmath35 .",
    "although there is certainly a family resemblance between the rfm and the ram , the difference between breaking the kramers degeneracy at the level of hamiltonian and breaking it spontaneously has profound consequences .",
    "one such consequence is theorem 4.4 of aizenman and wehr,@xcite which applies to the rfm , but not to the ram .",
    "a naive but not entirely misleading analogy may be drawn between the relationship of the rfm to the ram and the relationship between applying a uniform magnetic field to a ferromagnet or to an antiferromagnet .",
    "the field which couples linearly to the order parameter has a qualitatively stronger effect than the field which couples quadratically to the order parameter .",
    "translation invariance of @xmath50 is broken for any non - zero value of @xmath51 , since the vectors @xmath12 are random . within a high - temperature perturbation theory , performing a configuration average over the ensemble of random lattices appears to restore translation invariance above @xmath5 .",
    "however , the radius of convergence of this perturbation theory can not be greater for @xmath52 than it is for @xmath53 . for models described by eqn .",
    "( 1 ) , the @xmath5 predicted by extrapolating the low orders of perturbation theory is always maximal at @xmath53 .",
    "this implies that for @xmath52 the high - temperature perturbation theory does not converge near @xmath5 .",
    "the inadequacy of perturbation theory to describe @xmath0 models in @xmath39 , because of the effects of vortex lines , has been discussed by halperin.@xcite while it is not clear than halperin s argument is valid for the rfm , where the kramers degeneracy is broken by the hamiltonian , it should be valid for the ram .",
    "thus it seems quite implausible that for @xmath54 the twist energy for eqn .",
    "( 2 ) really scales as @xmath46 when @xmath52 , even though this is correct to all orders in the configuration - averaged perturbation theory .",
    "the argument of pelcovits@xcite for the @xmath15 ram , which is a prototype for much subsequent work,@xcite assumes that if one goes to small enough @xmath24 and low enough @xmath8 then the effects of vortex lines can be ignored .",
    "in essence , what is done is to replace the spin variables by a noncompact `` elastic manifold '' .",
    "these authors then claim that this does not effect the behavior one is studying",
    ". however , this can not be true when one considers behavior on scales larger than the imry - ma length.@xcite    the basic point is that imry - ma - type arguments for continuous o(_n _ ) spins ( _ i.e. _ @xmath55 ) are not self - consistent .",
    "one begins by assuming that the random field is weak so that the twist energy scales as @xmath46 , as in the absence of the randomness .",
    "then one shows that , if @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the effective coupling to the random field increases as @xmath2 increases .",
    "if the effective random coupling is strong , however , then assuming that the twist energy is uniformly distributed throughout the volume is not reasonable .",
    "the conclusion which should be drawn from this is that a deeper analysis is needed when @xmath56 .    in order to understand whether the problems with perturbation theory are actually due to vortex lines , and",
    "thus restricted to the @xmath15 case , or if similar problems can also be expected for @xmath58 , it may be helpful to reconsider the analysis of pelcovits , pytte and rudnick.@xcite these authors show that within their perturbation theory the pure o(_n _ ) mean - field theory critical fixed point remains stable against random anisotropy for @xmath59 .",
    "this contrasts to the random - field case , where mean - field theory is only stable for @xmath60 .",
    "then they argue that for @xmath56 and @xmath55 there is no stable critical fixed point for the ram , because under rescaling transformations the random anisotropy coupling constant runs off to @xmath4 .",
    "however , they did not ( and within their formulation could not ) examine the possibility that there could exist another ferromagnetic critical fixed point at a large value of @xmath24 .",
    "the reason why such an object may exist is that there exist alternative formulations of mean - field theory@xcite for the ram in the limit @xmath32 .",
    "it is useful to consider the generalization of eqn .",
    "( 2 ) to @xmath61-fold random fields.@xcite in the @xmath41 case@xcite it has been shown that there continues to be a kosterlitz - thouless phase as long as @xmath62 , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath62 a weak @xmath61-fold random field does not destroy the kosterlitz - thouless phase .",
    "it was claimed by aharony@xcite that ferromagnetism should be unstable for any value of @xmath61 when @xmath39 . however , a computer simulation study@xcite for @xmath63 is not consistent with this claim , which is based on the weak randomness perturbation theory around the @xmath53 model .",
    "this @xmath39 computer simulation finds that there is a mass gap at @xmath42 , an effect which can not be reproduced within the perturbation theory .",
    "the interpretation of this is that for @xmath64 the thickness of a domain wall remains finite in the limit @xmath65 , _",
    "i.e. _ the domain wall becomes localized by random pinning .",
    "removing vortex lines from the pure @xmath0 model by letting the vortex fugacity become large forces the system into a ferromagnetic state at any temperature.@xcite this result is true even in the presence of a strong @xmath66 random anisotropy,@xcite but the @xmath66 case is more complicated than @xmath64 . for @xmath66 , as we shall see , the domain walls probably have a fractal structure , rather than becoming completely localized .",
    "in this work , we will present results obtained from heat bath monte carlo calculations .",
    "the data were obtained from @xmath1 simple cubic lattices with @xmath67 using periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the calculations were done for a 12-state clock model , _",
    "i.e. _ a @xmath68 approximation@xcite to the @xmath0 model of eqn .",
    "the computer program was an adaptation of the code used recently for the @xmath0 model in a random field,@xcite modified to replace the random field term with the random 2-fold anisotropy term of eqn .",
    "( 2 ) . for any integer value of the quantity",
    "@xmath3 one can use a lookup table for the boltzmann factors , because all the energies in the problem are then expressible as sums of integers and integer multiples of @xmath69 .",
    "the values of @xmath3 for which data were obtained are 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , and @xmath4 .",
    "the discretization of the phase space of the model has significant effects at very low @xmath8 , but the effects at the temperatures we study here are expected to be negligible compared to our statistical errors .",
    "the probability distributions for the local magnetization of equilibrium states which are calculated for the @xmath68 model are found to have very small contributions from the third and higher harmonics of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "this is strong evidence that the 12-state clock model is an accurate approximation to the @xmath0 model within our range of parameters .",
    "the @xmath68 model shows equivalent behavior for @xmath51 and @xmath72 , unlike the @xmath73 model used earlier.@xcite    the program uses two independent linear congruential pseudorandom number generators , one for choosing the values of the @xmath22 , and a different one for the monte carlo spin flips , which are performed by a single - spin - flip heat - bath algorithm .",
    "the code was checked by setting @xmath53 , and seeing that the known behavior of the pure ferromagnetic system was reproduced correctly .",

    "12 , 13 , 14 and 15 show the corresponding plots for @xmath3 = 2 , 3 , 6 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath127 decrease monotonically as @xmath3 increases . in all cases , the values of @xmath127 given in the figures",
    "are estimated to be accurate to about 1% . as we also saw for @xmath129 and @xmath91 ,",
    "the fss data collapse is not good below @xmath5 for @xmath130 .",
    "the results for @xmath84 are in very good agreement with the earlier results@xcite obtained with the @xmath131 approximation .",
    "according to imry and ma@xcite and pelcovits , pytte and rudnick@xcite , for small @xmath24 this model should appear ferromagnetic when @xmath2 is smaller than the `` imry - ma length '' , which is determined by balancing the domain wall energy against the energy of random pinning .",
    "if this length exists , when @xmath2 is larger than the imry - ma length , the system will break up into domains , without long - range order . we have argued here , however , that in the presence of random pinning one should not believe that the domain wall energy scales as @xmath46 .",
    "one can try to patch up this picture by assuming that the domain wall energy scales as @xmath132 , with @xmath133 .",
    "if this were the case , then it would still be possible for @xmath39 to find a length scale where the domain wall energy balanced the random pinning energy",
    ". then it would continue to be true in @xmath39 that the system would break up into imry - ma - like domains when @xmath2 became very large .    what we see in our fss plots for @xmath134",
    ", however , is that when @xmath57 the leading correction to finite - size scaling increases the magnetization as @xmath2 increases . therefore this model appears to be stable against domain formation for @xmath134 , at least for some range of @xmath8 below @xmath5 .",
    "the natural interpretation of this result is that @xmath135 must be less than 3/2 in @xmath39 for the @xmath15 case .    fig .",
    "12 , the fss magnetization plot for @xmath3 = 3 , shows that as @xmath2 increases the data for @xmath57 seem to be converging to a scaling function which is independent of @xmath2 . for the data in fig .  15 for @xmath3 = 6",
    ", the data appear to be in this @xmath2-independent limit .",
    "if we were able to do the monte carlo calculations at substantially larger values of @xmath2 , we would expect to see the same type of convergence for @xmath3 = 1 and 2 .",
    "if we had data at such large values of @xmath2 , so that the magnetization scaling function had converged to an @xmath2-independent limit , then our estimates of the critical exponents would be expected to shift somewhat .",
    "therefore , it is likely that @xmath136 , the true value of @xmath100 in the range of @xmath3 from 1 to 6 , is actually independent of @xmath24",
    ".    the reader must also remember that the ferromagnetic phase is allowed to be reentrant .",
    "therefore , we do not claim that the ferromagnetic behavior which we see below @xmath5 must be stable down to @xmath8 = 0 over the entire range of @xmath24 .",
    "also , we do not claim stable ferromagnetism for very large values of @xmath24 .",
    "it must be stated , however , that this only applies to the simple cubic lattice with nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "we expect that it would be possible to stabilize a ferromagnetic phase at @xmath84 by adding further neighbor finite - range exchange interactions .",
    "we point out that our earlier claim@xcite of infinite magnetic susceptibility without ferromagnetism when @xmath84 was based on results at @xmath42.@xcite since the magnetization of finite simple cubic lattices with @xmath84 seems to be a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath8,@xcite however , we consider the existence of true ferromagnetism on this lattice to be unlikely at any @xmath8 for @xmath84 .",
    "the author sees no reason to believe that the exponent @xmath135 should be independent of @xmath35 for @xmath39 .",
    "thus , while we claim the existence of a ferromagnetic phase for @xmath15 , we are not making any claim here about the behavior for @xmath30 .",
    "we do expect that @xmath135 must converge to 2 in the limit @xmath44 , in agreement with the result of larkin.@xcite the reason for this is that for @xmath44 the `` elastic membrane '' approximation becomes valid",
    ".    clearly , it would be desirable to obtain a direct estimate of @xmath135 , by , for example , calculating the change in energy of a sample between periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions along one direction .",
    "since the energies involved are subextensive and the domain wall energy goes to zero at @xmath5 , it is difficult to do such a calculation .",
    "in this work we have presented monte carlo results for the @xmath39 @xmath0 random anisotropy model , eqn .",
    "( 2 ) , for several values of the anisotropy strength @xmath24 . by studying the finite - size scaling behavior of @xmath137 simple cubic lattices over the range @xmath67",
    ", we find that , for values of @xmath24 which are not very large , there appears to be a finite - temperature critical point at which the model undergoes a transition into a ferromagnetic phase .",
    "for this lattice at very large @xmath24 , the transition appears to be into a phase with qlro , but no true magnetization .",
