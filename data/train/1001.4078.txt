    "if we knew _ a priori _ that molecular absorption occurred at a single redshift in a single cloud and no other absorption lines were present , measuring @xmath31 would be straightforward : each molecular line s redshift could be determined from a fit against a well - defined background continuum and its relative deviation from some arbitrary redshift could be plotted against its @xmath30 coefficient .",
    "equation ( [ eq : shifts ] ) implies that @xmath31 would simply be the slope of such a plot .",
    "the offset would be degenerate with the arbitrary redshift itself ( though it clearly should be fitted as a free parameter ) .    in reality ,",
    "two main complicating factors are important .",
    "firstly , all molecular lines fall in the lyman-@xmath8 forest , the series of comparatively broad hi lyman-@xmath8 absorption lines randomly distributed in optical depth and redshift bluewards of the quasar s lyman-@xmath8 emission line . as figs .",
    "[ fig : fit_all ] and [ fig : lines ] show , many molecular lines fall within the absorption profile of one or more forest lines , so the latter must also be fitted to provide an effective background .",
    "secondly , the molecular lines show ` velocity structure '  several absorbing clouds with similar redshifts and different optical depths and doppler widths .",
    "the two main spectral features ( sfs ) highlighted in fig .  [ fig : lines ] are obvious examples , but we demonstrate below that each sf comprises more than one absorbing ` velocity component ' ( vc ) .",
    "the ` simultaneous fitting ' technique we employ here optimally and robustly addresses these complications by fitting all detected h@xmath3 and hd absorption profiles , together with the broader lyman-@xmath8 profiles , simultaneously in a single , comprehensive fit . minimizing @xmath73 allows uncertainties in the forest parameters  the effective continuum  to contribute naturally to uncertainties in @xmath31 .",
    "other advantages this technique brings over the earlier ` line - by - line ' fitting approach are outlined by @xcite .",
    "each absorption line is modelled as a voigt profile  the convolution of gaussian doppler broadening and the transition s natural line - shape .",
    "the oscillator strength and natural line - width determine the latter ; their values are provided in tables [ tab : h2 ] and [ tab : hd ] .",
    "three parameters describe each absorption cloud s properties : doppler width , @xmath92 , column density , @xmath93 , and redshift , @xmath19 .",
    "this is the only consideration for the lyman-@xmath8 lines but different molecular transitions share these parameters in physically important ways .    for h@xmath3 and hd",
    ", each @xmath67-level has a different ground state population , so all transitions from the same @xmath67-level have the same , single value of @xmath93 in each vc .",
    "this is clearly also true for the @xmath92 and @xmath19 values .",
    "however , we make the further assumption that the velocity structure is the same in all @xmath67-levels , i.e.  that a given vc has the same @xmath19 value in all @xmath67-levels .",
    "we test the importance of this assumption in section [ ssec : systematics ] and find that it has little impact on our results .",
    "we also assume that a given vc is characterised by the same , single value of @xmath92 in all @xmath67-levels ; we test the importance of this assumption in section [ ssec : consistency ] . in relating the absorption cloud parameters of different transitions in these physically meaningful ways ,",
    "the number of free parameters is minimized .",
    "this is similar to the analysis in @xcite , though they fitted the molecular oscillator strengths as free parameters as well . finally , because the hd transitions are few and relatively weak  recall that only the left - hand spectral feature is detected  we further assume that the ratio of an hd vc s column density to that of the corresponding vc in the h@xmath3 @xmath67=0 transitions is the same for all vcs . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_all ] , there is no strong evidence against this assumption , a conclusion corroborated by removing the hd transitions from the analysis altogether in section [ ssec : consistency ] .",
    "there are several feii transitions with @xmath94  near some h@xmath3 transitions which , in the @xmath95 absorber , appear quite weak but with velocity structure extending over @xmath14400 .",
    "the velocity components in these feii transitions are marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_all ] . this velocity structure",
    "was strongly constrained by using the fe ii@xmath961608  transition , which falls redwards of the lyman-@xmath8 forest and so has a well - defined continuum .",
    "this transition was blended with weak , broad civ@xmath961550 absorption associated with the quasar itself ( hamann et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the civ@xmath961550 absorption was constrained by fitting the corresponding civ@xmath961548 absorption .",
    "thus , it was necessary to model both metal line species , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_all ] , to obtain a reliable model of the feii transitions appearing near our h@xmath3 transitions of interest .",
    "the h@xmath3 fits are insensitive to those of the metal lines .    as noted in section [ ssec : keck ] , a nominal continuum was initially fitted to the lyman-@xmath8 forest region before establishing a detailed fit to the absorption lines .",
    "simple , low - order polynomial fits connecting seemingly unabsorbed regions of the spectrum , typically spaced apart by @xmath975000 , provided a qualitatively realistic continuum .",
    "however , _",
    "quantitatively _ different continua were determined by different authors of this paper ; the differences were large enough to slightly affect fits to individual absorption lines . and",
    "because our line fitting approach explicitly connects the properties of molecular lines to each other , it is important to recognise that this nominal , _ fixed _ quasar continuum is unlikely to allow very good fits to the many molecular transitions simultaneously .",
    "it is therefore important in such cases to fit local continua around transitions where the nominal continuum is particularly uncertain .",
    "these local continua are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fit_all ] and [ fig : lines ] .",
    "the reader will note that , for molecular transitions around which broad lyman-@xmath8 lines are also fitted , there will be strong degeneracies between the lyman-@xmath8 line parameters and those of the local continuum .",
    "for this reason , the local continua have polynomial degree of , at most , unity ( i.e.  they are either constants or straight lines in wavelength space ) . also , the fitting code we use indicates cases where the degeneracies are so strong that a local continuum fit serves the same purpose as the lyman-@xmath8 line(s ) .",
    "it should be emphasised that these ambiguities and uncertainties in the local continuum shape all contribute to the uncertainties in the molecular line fits in a natural way because , in our @xmath73 minimization process , all parameters of the fit are varied simultaneously .",
    "most previous works ( excluding , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) effectively determined fixed , local continua before fitting the molecular lines .",
    "this means that uncertainties in the continuum fits do not propagate through to the more interesting parameters of the subsequent fit , like @xmath31 .",
    "while only a small effect , the uncertainty in @xmath31 would be underestimated with such an approach .",
    "weak night sky emission is nominally subtracted during the initial flux extraction process , but systematic uncertainties in the zero flux level can and do remain .",
    "there are many obvious examples in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_all ] of saturated lyman-@xmath8 features which have non - zero average flux ( either positive or , usually , negative ) in their flat - bottomed line cores ( e.g.  features near 3107 , 3137 , 3171 , 3317 and 3350 ) .",
    "we therefore included the zero level as a free parameter when fitting regions of spectrum which included nearly saturated absorption lines ( either lyman-@xmath8 and/or molecular ) .",

    "although it is possible that the published oscillator strengths for these transitions , which ( along with all other molecular lines used in our fit ) are calculated rather than experimentally measured , are incorrect , we consider this very unlikely because these transitions are not affected by interference between multiple interacting h@xmath3 states",
    ". fits to h@xmath3 transitions , which included some of these particular transitions , in other quasar absorbers also suggests their published oscillator strengths are reliable ( j.  king , private communication ) .",
    "an alternative explanation is motivated by the fact that these transitions all fall on the combined o vi / lyman-@xmath101 quasar emission line at @xmath102@xmath103 : perhaps there is some inhomogeneity in the h@xmath3 column density on the scale of the quasar broad emission - line region .",
    "independent evidence for this scenario does not appear readily available in our spectrum , so it is difficult to confirm and will be explored in future work .",

    "however , as we describe in section [ sssec : params ] and as is apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_all ] , several molecular transitions are often fitted together in one contiguous fitting region .",

    "the very small increase in the statistical uncertainty compared to equation ( [ eq : raw_result ] ) is symptomatic of how weakly these @xmath115 and @xmath116 transitions affect @xmath31 , due primarily to their low optical depth .",
    "a similar problem may exist for the hd transitions , which are also very weak ; a 4-component model with the hd transitions dependence on @xmath4 removed returned @xmath119 .",
    "in section [ sssec : params ] we described how the predicted optical depths for the @xmath67=03 h@xmath3 transitions falling at @xmath120@xmath99  ( i.e.  where the lyman-@xmath101/oiv quasar emission line falls ) were too low , possibly because there is some inhomogeneity in the h@xmath3 column density on the angular scale of the quasar broad line region .",
    "we therefore allowed these transitions oscillator strengths to effectively vary as free parameters in the fit .",
    "this may not be an accurate parametrisation so we must assess the extent to which it affects our conclusions .",
    "firstly , if we remove the @xmath4-dependence of the 10 @xmath67=03 h@xmath3 transitions concerned ( by setting their @xmath30 values to zero ) , a 4-component fit gives @xmath121 .",
    "another test is to fit all h@xmath3/hd transitions with oscillator strengths as free parameters , i.e.  the column densities of different transitions from the same @xmath67-level are allowed to be different , as in the fits conducted by @xcite . a 4-component fit yields @xmath122 .",
    "notice that the statistical uncertainty does not increase discernibly here , even though the number of fitted parameters has been increased significantly ; this is because the many column - density parameters for the molecular velocity components of each transition have very little influence on the fitted line positions , which is what primarily affects @xmath31 .",
    "our fiducial model assumes that a given molecular vc has the same @xmath92-parameter in all @xmath67-levels .",
    "one can envisage different physical effects which may invalidate this model assumption . and while we do not find obvious evidence to the contrary in our spectra , it may be that our fitting approach  where we make the assumption and then build up the fit to the molecular lines by adding vcs until all the statistical structure in the molecular line profiles is modelled  is not the best method for identifying such an effect .",
    "we have therefore relaxed the assumption to test its effect on the fitted value of @xmath31 : when allowing vcs to have different @xmath92-parameters in different @xmath67-levels , @xmath123 .",
    "while there is small change in the value of @xmath31 with respect to the fiducial value in equation ( [ eq : raw_result ] ) , it does not represent a strong model dependency .",
    "we note in passing that allowing vcs to have different @xmath92-parameters in different @xmath67-levels does not solve the problem , discussed above , of some h@xmath3 transitions appearing stronger in the spectrum compared to the prediction of the fiducial fit ; those transitions come from a range of different @xmath67-levels",

    "the above consistency checks indicate that the fiducial value of @xmath31 is not strongly dependent on the assumptions made in our 4-component fit . individually relaxing these assumptions",
    "produces little change in the measured value of @xmath31 .",
    "this is also consistent with there being no important problems with our data , or our analysis .        since a varying @xmath4 should cause velocity shifts between molecular transitions , wavelength calibration errors which _ distort _ the wavelength scale are clearly important potential sources of systematic errors in @xmath31 .",
    "note that , as implied by equation ( [ eq : shifts ] ) , effects which shift the wavelength scale by a constant velocity at all wavelengths are generally unimportant .",
    "the first , most obvious possibility is that the wavelength scale of the thar exposures was incorrectly determined .",
    "this is easily checked .",
    "the wavelength calibration residuals , with @xmath124 , are consistent with being symmetrically distributed around the final wavelength solution at all wavelengths .",

    "for example , over the 12 hires echelle orders covering the wavelength range where the molecular lines fall ( 30713421 ) , 150200 thar lines are used to calibrate our thar exposures . clearly though , systematic trends in these residuals are still possible . using the same technique employed in @xcite to track systematic patterns in the thar calibration residuals ,",
    "the possible distortion in the wavelength scale between 3070 and 3430  is @xmath5630ms@xmath66 .",
    "this corresponds to a systematic error in @xmath31 of @xmath125 at most .",

    "the temperature and atmospheric pressure drifts during our observations were @xmath561k and @xmath65 mbar respectively . according to the @xcite formula for the refractive index of air , this would cause _ differential _ velocity shifts between 3070 and 3430  of @xmath5610ms@xmath66 , which are negligible .",
    "the quasar and thar light traverse similar but not identical paths through hires .",
    "only the quasar light passes from the telescope into hires and the thar light ( nearly ) uniformly illuminates the slit while the quasar light is centrally concentrated .",
    "_ different _ distortions of the wavelength scale  within individual echelle orders ( ` intra - order ' ) and over longer wavelength ranges ( ` long - range ' )  may therefore occur in the quasar and corresponding thar exposures .",
    "@xcite recently identified intra - order distortions in hires .",
    "they compared the wavelength scales established using thar exposures with those imprinted on quasar exposures by an iodine absorption cell .",
    "the distortions are such that , for different transitions at the same redshift in a quasar spectrum , those at the order edges appear at positive velocities with respect to transitions at the order centres when calibrated with a thar exposure .",
    "the peak - to - peak velocity distortion is @xmath14500  at @xmath145600  and may worsen ( improve ) with increasing ( decreasing ) wavelength ; see figure 4 of @xcite .",
    "the effect is similar ( though not identical ) for all echelle orders in the wavelength range @xmath1450006200  covered by the iodine cell absorption . if we assume that similar intra - order distortions apply to our spectra of j2123@xmath10050 at much bluer wavelengths then , because the molecular transitions of interest lie at different positions along different echelle orders , we should expect the effect on @xmath31 to be suppressed . to illustrate this ,",
    "a very crude estimate of the ` residual ' velocity distortion is just the observed @xmath14500peak - to - peak intra - order value reduced according to the number of molecular transitions observed , i.e.  @xmath126 .",
    "this corresponds to a systematic error in @xmath31 of approximately @xmath127 .",
    "this crude calculation fails to take into account the strong variation in the spectral  across the wavelength range containing the h@xmath3/hd transitions , their different sensitivities to @xmath4 variation , where they fall with respect to echelle order edges in our particular spectrum and other factors such as the degree of blending with lyman-@xmath8 forest lines of each molecular transition .",
    "a simple monte carlo simulation which takes into account the first two of these effects   and @xmath30 for each transition  was undertaken as follows .",
    "each realisation comprised a velocity shift , @xmath24 , chosen randomly for each transition , @xmath18 , from the 500  peak - to - peak interval spanned by the intra - order distortions identified by @xcite .",
    "the square of the  of the spectral data surrounding the molecular transitions then weighted a linear least squares fit of the @xmath128 versus @xmath30 values , the slope of which provided a value of @xmath31 for that realisation ",
    "see equation ( [ eq : shifts ] ) .",
    "the distribution of values for @xmath31 over hundreds of thousands of monte carlo realizations was close to gaussian with an rms of @xmath129",
    ".    however , the most direct calculation of the possible systematic effect on @xmath31 , which takes into account all remaining effects ( e.g.  positions of transitions with respect to order edges , line blending etc . ) , can be obtained by attempting to remove the intra - order distortions from our individual quasar exposures . to this end",
    "we applied a @xmath1250  velocity shift to the wavelengths of all echelle order centres for all our quasar exposures .",
    "the shift was reduced linearly with distance from the order centres to reach @xmath130250  at the order edges .",
    "the spectra were recombined again to form a final 1-dimensional spectrum to which we fit the 4-component model as before .",
    "the value of @xmath31 derived from this ` corrected ' spectrum was @xmath131 . compared with the fiducial 4-component result of @xmath132 , this represents a smaller effect , approximately @xmath133 , than expected from the cruder estimates above .",
    "given that @xcite observed smaller distortions at shorter wavelengths , it may also overestimate the real effect .    to summarise the above considerations , if the intra - order distortions of the wavelength scale identified by @xcite at 50006500  also affect the much bluer wavelengths of interest here , the implied systematic error on @xmath31 is approximately @xmath133 in our particular spectrum .",
    "however , the main assumption in this estimate is that we have modelled the @xcite intra - order distortions reliably .",
    "the physical explanation for those distortions is not yet known , so we do not know whether , for example , the phase of the saw - tooth distortion pattern with respect to the order edges is the same for all quasar exposures taken at different times and with different telescope and observational conditions ( e.g.  telescope pointing direction , seeing etc . ) , nor do we know whether the intra - order distortions follow a general saw - tooth pattern at all , or if the distortions in the uv can be predicted based on those in the iodine cell s calibration range .",
    "these important questions should be resolved with future observations and careful re - calibrations of hires .",
    "thus , our estimate of @xmath133 for the systematic error due to intra - order distortions may also be subject to model errors .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : k ] one observes a general decrease in the @xmath30 coefficients for the fitted lyman h@xmath3 transitions with increasing wavelength .",
    "a long range , monotonic distortion of the wavelength scale is therefore nearly degenerate ( though not completely ) with the effect of a shift in @xmath4 on the lyman lines .",
    "put another way , a systematic effect which produced a long - range wavelength distortion would cause a strong systematic effect on @xmath31 if only the lyman h@xmath3 transitions were fitted .",
    "it is therefore important to fit the werner transitions as well : their @xmath30 values are very different to those of the lyman transitions at similar wavelengths , potentially breaking the degeneracy between @xmath31 and long - range wavelength distortions and improving resistance to systematic errors .",
    "if we remove the @xmath4-dependence of the 12 h@xmath3 and 1 hd werner transitions in our fit , a 4-component model is statistically preferred and returns @xmath134 , very similar to the fiducial result in equation ( [ eq : raw_result ] ) .",
    "however , the  at bluer wavelengths where the werner transitions fall is much lower than for the reddest lyman transitions , so the effect of the werner transitions in breaking this degeneracy between @xmath31 and long - range wavelength distortions is reduced . to illustrate this",

    "indeed , when this spectrum is fitted with the fiducial model used to generate it , @xmath31 shifts from @xmath144 before compression to @xmath145 after compression , as expected . and",
    "when the @xmath4-dependence of the 12 h@xmath3 and 1 hd werner transitions is removed when fitting the compressed spectrum , @xmath31 only changes by small amount to @xmath146 .",
    "that is , simply removing the werner transitions dependence on @xmath4 is not a very effective test for long - range distortions of the wavelength scale .",
    "a more meaningful test is to fit only the lyman and werner transitions in the bluest part of the spectrum and not the redder lyman transitions .",
    "if we fit the 51 werner and lyman lines bluewards of @xmath147  in our simulated spectrum , @xmath31 only shifts from @xmath148 to @xmath149 when the compression is introduced , indicating the expected resistance to this systematic error . with the @xmath4-dependence of the 12 h@xmath3 and 1 hd werner transitions removed in this fit",
    ", @xmath31 is @xmath150 and @xmath151 before and after compression , respectively .",
    "that is , if there is a long - range , monotonic distortion of the wavelength scale , we expect to find a substantial shift in @xmath31 when the @xmath4-dependence of the werner transitions is removed . for the real spectrum ,",
    "the value of @xmath31 derived from the lyman and werner lines bluewards of @xmath147  is @xmath152 and , when the @xmath4-dependence of the werner transitions is removed , this changes to @xmath153 .",
    "thus , despite this being a reasonable test for long - range distortions of the wavelength scale , it fails to reveal evidence for such an effect in our spectrum of j2123@xmath10050 .      as discussed in section [ ssec : keck ] , the spectrum to which we fit our absorption profile models is the weighted mean of several individual quasar exposures . in combining these spectra ,",
    "they were all re - dispersed onto the same wavelength grid .",
    "note that the data reduction procedures we employed meant that each exposure was only re - binned in this way just once .",
    "nevertheless , this rebinning introduces correlations between the flux ( and flux uncertainty ) of neighbouring pixels . in principle",
    ", this should have a small effect on the fitted centroid of any spectral feature and so , even though we fit many molecular lines simultaneously , a residual effect on @xmath31 may exist . to test the possible size of this effect we re - combined the quasar exposures onto a variety of slightly different wavelength grids with different dispersions ( i.e.  per pixel ) and wavelength zero points .",
    "the values of @xmath31 derived from these different versions of the final combined spectrum varied by @xmath154 at most .",
    "the fiducial absorption model assumes that the molecular velocity structure is the same in all @xmath67-levels ( see section [ sssec : params ] ) . in a galactic line of sight with h@xmath3 absorption",
    ", @xcite found that ( part of ) the absorption profile becomes broader and systematically shifts in velocity with increasing @xmath67 .",
    "the absorption profiles comprise many velocity components spanning velocities greater than the broadening and shifting observed .",
    "this is consistent with the velocity structure being the same in all @xmath67-levels where some constituent vcs have low optical depths in the low-@xmath67 transitions but are relatively strong in the higher-@xmath67 transitions .",
    "thus , if one knew the velocity structure  or one used as many vcs as required to model all the statistically significant structure in the observed line profiles  one may not necessarily find that individual vcs broaden or shift with increasing @xmath67 .",
    "instead , one would simply find that the relative column densities of neighbouring vcs changed with increasing @xmath67 .",
    "however , if any significant unmodelled structure remains , and its effective optical depth varies as a function of @xmath67 , it may cause a systematic effect in @xmath31 .",
    "an example of this effect in an h@xmath3-bearing quasar absorber was identified by @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered this possibility , pointing out that the potential effect on @xmath31 is diminished because transitions of different @xmath67 are interspersed in wavelength space .",
    "this is also evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : k ] ( lower panel ) .",
    "although we emphasise that figs .",
    "[ fig : comps ] and [ fig : crs ] demonstrate that all the statistically significant structure in the molecular transitions has been modelled , we can make a direct test for this effect by allowing @xmath31 _ and _ the velocity structure to be different for different h@xmath3 @xmath67-levels and hd . in section [ ssec : consistency ] we made only the former assumption and found that a stringent test , with relatively small statistical uncertainties , was only possible when grouping together different h@xmath3 @xmath67-levels and hd . by introducing more free parameters in this new test  the different vc redshifts  for different h@xmath3 @xmath67-levels and hd ( or groups thereof )",
    ", we expect even larger uncertainties .",
    "so we again form groups of h@xmath3 @xmath67-levels and hd , deriving a single value of @xmath31 with a 4-component velocity structure in the hd and h@xmath3 @xmath67=01 levels and another value with a different 4-component model for the h@xmath3 @xmath67=25 levels .",
    "the two values are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : j ] ( right panel ) : we see no strong evidence for the effects of unmodelled velocity structure as a function of species ( h@xmath3 @xmath67-level or hd ) .      to summarise the above discussion , by far",
    "the two most important potential systematic effects are small distortions in the thar wavelength scale and intra - order distortions of the quasar wavelength scale relative to the thar exposures .",
    "these contribute systematic errors in @xmath31 of approximately @xmath155 and @xmath133 , respectively .",
    "effects from re - dispersion of the spectra may contribute as much as @xmath154 .",
    "our final result for the @xmath57 absorber observed in the keck spectrum of j2123@xmath10050 is @xmath156 this includes the 1-@xmath86 statistical error [ see equation ( [ eq : raw_result ] ) ] and the quadrature addition of the three main potential systematic errors discussed in section [ ssec : systematics ] : long- and short - range wavelength calibration errors and effects from re - dispersion of the spectra .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the confidence level represented by the quoted systematic error component , though it is likely to represent a higher confidence ( i.e.  @xmath5268per cent ) than the 1-@xmath86 level represented by the quoted statistical uncertainty .",
    "however , we emphasise that the systematic error estimate for short - range calibration errors is based only on the limited information about intra - order wavelength distortions currently accessible @xcite ; it is therefore model - dependent and may under- or over - estimate the true effect , if present .",
    "our result in equation ( [ eq : final_result ] ) is based on fitting an absorption profile model to particular regions of the spectrum which contain 86 h@xmath3 and 7 hd transitions , most of which are blended to varying extents with broader lyman-@xmath8 forest lines , and a few of which blend with well - constrained , weak metal absorption .",
    "all these lines , together with local continua and zero flux level adjustments for most lines , are fitted simultaneously to determine a single , best - fit value of @xmath31 . to reduce the number of free parameters in the fit , two main physically motivated assumptions were made about the molecular transitions : that the velocity structure is the same for all @xmath67-levels and that individual velocity components have the same doppler broadening parameter in all @xmath67-levels .",
    "also , since the hd lines are so weak , it was convenient to assume that the hd ( @xmath157 ) velocity components follow the same relative optical depth pattern as the h@xmath3 @xmath157 transitions .",
    "finally , the oscillator strengths of some h@xmath3 transitions were effectively treated as free parameters because their optical depths are higher than expected based on our fiducial model ; see section [ sssec : params ] . however , we have individually relaxed each of these assumptions and/or removed the transitions they pertain to , and find the fiducial result in equation ( [ eq : final_result ] ) to be quite insensitive to them .",
    "figure [ fig : summary ] compares the contemporary astronomical @xmath31 constraints outside our galaxy .",
    "our new constraint is the first from keck with precision comparable to those from the vlt .",
    "agreement is seen between our keck result and the three vlt constraints from @xcite who used similar calibration and fitting techniques to those described here .",
    "such consistency is encouraging , allowing us to ( at least formally ) derive a weighted mean value of @xmath158 for redshifts @xmath159@xmath160 .",
    "statistical errors are shown as thinner error bars with shorter terminators in fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] .",
    "although the statistical error in our new measurement is slightly smaller than for two of the @xcite absorbers , it is slightly worse than for the @xmath46 absorber towards q0528@xmath1250 , i.e.  @xmath161 .",
    "the main reason for this is the lower  of our current keck spectrum of j2123@xmath10050 , despite the fact that its spectral resolution is higher and more molecular transitions were utilized in our analysis . since j2123@xmath10050 is relatively bright , improvements in both the statistical and systematic uncertainties can be achieved with new observations of moderate duration . and",
    "since it is located near the celestial equator , j2123@xmath10050 can easily be observed from both keck and vlt , enabling a further opportunity to check for instrumental systematic errors .",

    "note that two of the @xcite absorbers use the same raw vlt data as those analysed previously by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "these results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] for comparison with the higher redshift h@xmath3/hd constraints .",
    "it is clear that the radio constraints have superior precision and , by current estimates , smaller potential systematic errors .",
    "however , direct comparison of the radio and optical constraints is difficult because of the possibility , in principle , for spatial variations in @xmath4 : the different molecular species ( nh@xmath162 and h@xmath3/hd ) trace regions of different densities and , therefore , different spatial scales and environment .",
    "if @xmath4 does vary , we do not know what that variation depends on , so it is presumptuous to prefer one type of measurement over the other .",
    "indeed , this is highlighted by @xcite who studied nh@xmath162 inversion _ emission _ lines from numerous galactic molecular clouds . with statistical errors from previous literature of @xmath140.1",
    "they find velocity offsets between the nh@xmath162 inversion and rotational molecular emission of up to @xmath168  in individual systems .",
    "this might indicate spatial variations in @xmath4 throughout our galaxy , although intrinsic shifts between emission lines of different molecules are to be expected .",
    "the possibility for both space- and time - variations in @xmath4 is even more important given the different redshift ranges currently probed by the radio and optical constraints .",
    "several other quasar absorption- and emission - line techniques for constraining variations in combinations of fundamental constants involving @xmath4 are also of note .",
    "for example , comparison of h i 21-cm absorption with metal absorption lines constrains the quantity @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the proton @xmath171-factor .",
    "a variety of analyses using different metal - ions have been performed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with measurements from 9 absorption systems at @xmath172 by @xcite providing a constraint of @xmath173",
    ". however , the fact that the hi 21-cm and metal - line velocity structures are observationally dissimilar  probably because the radio morphology of most background quasars is not point - like  means that improvements must come by averaging over many sight - lines and/or carefully selecting quasars with point - like radio morphologies . comparing hi 21-cm with the ` main ' oh 18-cm absorption lines , which constrains @xmath174 @xcite , suffers less from this problem because of the similarity of the wavelengths concerned .",
    "@xcite analysed two absorbers at @xmath175 and @xmath176 to obtain the constraint @xmath177 .",
    "finally , a promising technique is to use the ` satellite ' oh 18-cm lines which , when the ground state level populations are inverted , results in the two transitions being ` conjugate '  one occurs in emission , the other in absorption , but they have the same optical depth profile and are guaranteed to arise in the same gas clouds .",
    "comparing the sum and difference of the optical depth profiles of the 1612 and 1720mhz conjugate satellite lines constrains @xmath178 @xcite . with only two such systems known outside our galaxy , and with their published spectra having very low ,",
    "no definitive constraints on @xmath179 yet exist @xcite .",
    "@xcite has presented a preliminary constraint of @xmath180 for a system at @xmath181 and also @xmath182 for a galactic system , centaurus a.    while these constraints on variations in @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 are important in their own right , it is difficult to compare them with constraints on @xmath31 . as we mentioned in section",
    "[ sec : intro ] , predictions for the relationships between variations in , e.g. , @xmath4 and @xmath8 are strongly model - dependent @xcite . currently , there is also no overlap with the redshift range occupied by the h@xmath3/hd constraints on @xmath31 and variations in @xmath183 , @xmath184 and/or @xmath185 .",
    "a striking feature of fig .  [ fig : summary ] is the paucity of direct @xmath4 measurements outside our galaxy .",
    "compare this with , for example , the 143 constraints on @xmath8-variation available from keck / hires over the redshift range @xmath186@xmath187 @xcite . clearly , much larger samples of both nh@xmath162 and h@xmath3/hd constraints , in overlapping redshift ranges , would allow additional tests for systematic errors and stronger conclusions to be drawn . in this respect it is important to reduce the statistical errors in individual h@xmath3/hd measurements .",
    "this can only be done by substantially increasing the snr of the optical spectra .",
    "we have demonstrated here that , at least for the keck / hires spectrum of j2123@xmath10050 , the statistical error still dominates over systematic errors [ equation ( [ eq : final_result ] ) ] .",
    "nevertheless , if such systematic errors are not also reduced by improving the spectral snr , it becomes more important to greatly increase the number of h@xmath3/hd absorbers for measuring @xmath31 in order to approach the precision demonstrated in the nh@xmath162 measurements .",

    "<S> molecular transitions recently discovered at redshift @xmath0 toward the bright background quasar j2123@xmath10050 are analysed to limit cosmological variation in the proton - to - electron mass ratio , @xmath2 . observed with the keck telescope , </S>",
    "<S> the optical echelle spectrum has the highest resolving power and largest number ( 86 ) of h@xmath3 transitions in such analyses so far . </S>",
    "<S> also , ( seven ) hd transitions are used for the first time to constrain @xmath4-variation . </S>",
    "<S> these factors , and an analysis employing the fewest possible free parameters , strongly constrain @xmath4 s relative deviation from the current laboratory value : @xmath5 , indicating an insignificantly larger @xmath4 in the absorber . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first keck result to complement recent null constraints from three systems at @xmath6 observed with the very large telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the main possible systematic errors stem from wavelength calibration uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , distortions in the wavelength solution on echelle order scales are estimated to contribute approximately half the total systematic error component , but our estimate is model dependent and may therefore under or overestimate the real effect , if present .    to assist future @xmath4-variation analyses of this kind , and other astrophysical studies of h@xmath3 in general , we provide a compilation of the most precise laboratory wavelengths and calculated parameters important for absorption - line work with h@xmath3 transitions redwards of the hydrogen lyman limit .    </S>",
