    "the drift project aims to develop and operate the first underground time projection chamber ( tpc ) array suitable for observing and reconstructing wimp - induced nuclear recoil tracks with enough precision to provide a signature of the local wimp galactic halo  @xcite .",
    "the development of the drift negative ion tpc ( nitpc ) detector concept is covered in  @xcite .",
    "a full desription of the latest detector design , drift - ii , including installation and operation of the first modules , drift - iia and drift - iib , at boulby mine is covered in  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to bring together results concerning the behaviour of drift - iia and drift - iib as evidenced by observation of various classes of alpha particle events .",
    "the results in this paper are complementary to those covered in  @xcite , where the alpha decay of radon progeny were found to produce recoil - like events .",
    "although alpha particle events are , ultimately , an unwanted background in a rare event detector , their presence in drift allows investigations of event discrimination , track reconstruction , directional sensitivity and other data analysis capabilities .",
    "determination of the accuracy of ion transport codes ( e.g. srim2003  @xcite ) is also possible .",
    "alpha particles of a few mev in 40 torr cs@xmath9 produce essentially straight tracks typically 300700 mm long  @xcite that are easily rejected from a dark matter analysis by range and energy cuts ( see  [ sec : bg_alphas ] and @xcite ) .",
    "such tracks provide an ideal means for developing track reconstruction algorithms .",
    "studies ( see  [ sec : alpha_types ]  and   [ sec : mcs ] ) of the alpha particle event populations found in drift - ii data also provide important information to allow elimination of such background events from present and future modules .",
    "the remainder of this paper will cover detector design (  [ sec : design ] ) , data analysis (  [ sec : analysis ] ) , a discussion of the different types of alpha particle events observed (  [ sec : alpha_types ] ) , simulations of alpha activity (  [ sec : mcs ] ) , determination of the drift velocity and range - discrimination of different alpha particle tracks (  [ sec : drift_vel ] ) .",
    "the drift project aims to make continuing improvements to the design of drift detector modules .",
    "drift - iib is an upgraded version of drift - iia  @xcite in which the significant differences are a simplified arrangement of electronics and the replacement of copper fieldrings with stainless steel versions .",
    "briefly , each detector consists of a @xmath11 m@xmath12 stainless steel vacuum vessel housing a 1 m@xmath12 dual low pressure tpc filled with cs@xmath9 vapour at 40 torr .",
    "the two modules were operated at different mean drift fields ( 620 v / cm in drift - iia , 581 v / cm in drift - iib ) .",
    "the two 0.5 m long drift regions share a central plane of 512 stainless steel wires of 20 @xmath13 m diameter spaced 2 mm apart .",
    "this arrangement forms a highly transparent drift cathode .",
    "readout of charge deposited within the drift regions is via two 1 m@xmath14 multi wire proportional chambers ( mwpcs ) , 50 cm either side of the central cathode .",
    "the mwpcs consist of grid planes of 512 stainless steel wires of 100 @xmath13 m diameter .",
    "the grid planes are spaced 1 cm either side of an anode plane comprising 512 wires of 20 @xmath13 m diameter .",
    "these are arranged orthogonal to the wires in the grids .",
    "the wire spacing in all the planes is 2 mm .",
    "veto regions are instrumented around the edges of the wire planes .    the central section of the anode and inner grid planes are each grouped down to eight outputs . as such",
    ", any track that extends a distance greater than that sampled by eight wires ( @xmath15 mm ) will reappear on the same output channnels at a later time in the event record ( see  @xcite for details of drift data format ) .",
    "this phenomenon was characteristic of all the alpha particle tracks observed .",
    "since high energy alpha particles have a range greater than 300 mm in 40 torr cs@xmath9 , the hit pattern on the eight outputs repeats many times .",
    "figure  [ fig : typ_alpha_event ] depicts waveforms for an example alpha particle event .",
    "a dedicated analysis was developed to specifically select alpha particle like events from the data .",
    "alpha particle tracks are sufficiently different from those of nuclear recoils that the analysis procedures described in ref  @xcite would not have been appropriate .    during data acquisition",
    "all electronics channels had their signals digitised and recorded when any anode signal exceeded the hardware threshold ( 200 adc points , where 2048 adcs is equivalent to one volt ) . throughout this paper ` above threshold ' means that the absolute value of the waveform exceeded the absolute value of the threshold unless specified otherwise .",
    "once acquired , three virtual waveforms for each mwpc ( the grid sum , the anode sum and the veto difference  see figure  [ fig : typ_alpha_event ] ) were then constructed from existing waveforms .",
    "all waveforms ( real and virtual ) then underwent a fast fourier transform ( fft ) to identify frequency components introduced by unwanted signal pickup ( specifically , components around 50 khz associated with the drift cathode power supply ) .",
    "the unwanted frequencies were notched out and the result inverse fourier transformed . for each waveform , the baseline was calculated using the mean signal value in the pretrigger region between @xmath16 and @xmath17s from the trigger time ( a total of 1 ms is recorded prior to the trigger ) .",
    "the data were then smoothed using a savitzky - golay filter  @xcite using a 4th - degree polynomial .",
    "this allowed the effective analysis threshold to be reduced to @xmath18 adc points .",
    "the raw and smoothed data were reduced to a number of parameters that were stored in several tables within a relational database that could then by queried by subsequent analysis routines .",
    "the following is a brief description of the key parameters used .",
    "the names of all analysis parameters in this paper are refered to using _",
    "italics_.      for each output channel , the voltage waveforms were scanned for pulses , i.e. sections which exceeded threshold .",
    "these sections are refered to as signal profiles .",
    "a signal profile was deemed to start and end at the nearest points , either side of the peak , where the waveform crossed the baseline .",
    "the main parameters extracted from the raw data are summarised in table  [ tab : an_params ] .",
    ".the main analysis parameters extracted from the raw data.[tab : an_params ] [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the values of the geometric factors in drift - iia for both @xmath4rn and @xmath6rn , determined from multiple runs of the code , were @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , due to the cuts described in   [ sec : flags ] .",
    "the difference is due to the lower probability of the longer @xmath6rn alpha particle tracks being fully contained within the effective fiducial volume .",
    "a similar difference is seen in drift - iib ( @xmath21 for @xmath4rn , @xmath22 for @xmath6rn ) where the lower drift field reduced the fiducial volume in the z - direction . in all cases",
    "the systematic error takes into account uncertainties in the track ranges and drift velocities and the statistical error represents the spread in the results from ten identical runs .",
    "the rate of gpcc events observed in drift - ii background data was used to estimate the total emanation rate into the vessel from all components .",
    "figure  [ fig : alpha - rate_fit ] shows data taken from a series of drift - iia runs spanning a period of about two and a half weeks in the middle of the 2005 data taking period .",
    "these particular runs were chosen because the vessel had been evacuated , flushed and refilled immediately before acquisition started .",
    "a fit to the function given in equation  [ eq : sean_eq ] is also shown where the only free parameter was the reduced emanation rate @xmath23 .",
    "a clear exponential rise is observed in accordance with the model described by equation  [ eq : sean_eq ] with a best fit value of @xmath24 hz .",
    "setting @xmath25 in equation  [ eq : sean_eq ] allows one to determine the steady - state radon decay rate as @xmath26 hz and thus the total steady - state emanation rate was @xmath27 hz , assuming @xmath4rn formed the dominant contribution to the observed alpha activity .",
    "an independant analysis , separate from that used to search for nuclear recoil events , has been developed to study phenomena associated with the alpha decays of radioactive contamination within the drift - iia and drift - iib directional dark matter detectors .    the alpha particles produced as a result of the decay of @xmath4rn , @xmath6rn and their progeny ( easily rejected in a dark matter analysis ) have proved useful in determining a number of operational characteristics . the drift velocity was determined by two methods , one in each of the operational modules ( see table  [ tab : v_drift - results ] in previous section ) .",
    "the first method , employing a directed @xmath3po alpha particle source in drift - iib determined the drift velocity to be @xmath28 ( stat ) @xmath29 ( sys ) ms@xmath1 .",
    "the second method , using the intrinsic alpha particle background in drift - iia found @xmath30 ( stat ) @xmath31 ( sys ) ms@xmath1 . additionally , the range of alpha particle tracks was found to be an efficient discriminating factor between different alpha particle emitting species .",
    "this highlighted the possibility of some radon progeny being produced within the fiducial volume in an uncharged state and thus not being swept onto the central cathode by the drift field .",
    "consequently , the decay of these uncharged progeny were able to produce alpha particle tracks that occasionally cross the cathode ( gpcc events ) .",
    "combining knowledge of the relative populations of radon gpccs and those of their immediate progeny with results of a monte carlo simulation allowed an estimate of the fraction @xmath32 of polonium progeny produced uncharged . in the case of @xmath5po ,",
    "the uncharged fraction was found to be @xmath33 and for @xmath7po , @xmath34 .",
    "this knowledge may prove useful in future more complex simulations of alpha emitting contamination in drift - type detectors .",
