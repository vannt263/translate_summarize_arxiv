    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs  for a comprehensive review , see @xcite ) are close interacting binary systems in which a white dwarf ( wd ) accretes material from its late - type low mass companion . in the absence of a strong magnetic field , the material transferred from the donor star forms an accretion disc around the wd and gradually spirals down onto its surface .",
    "if the mass - transfer rate is low , the accretion disc can suffer a thermal instability caused by hydrogen ionisation , resulting in outbursts .",
    "dwarf novae ( dn ) are an important subset of cvs , which undergo such outbursts .",
    "intermediate polars ( ip ) are another subset of cvs in which the magnetic field of the wd is strong enough to disrupt the inner accretion disc and force the accreting material to flow along field lines on to one or both magnetic poles .",
    "outbursts can also arise in the truncated discs of ips , although only a few such objects are known ( e.g. , yy  dra , cc  scl , gk  per ) .",
    "the difference in the strength of the magnetic field of the wd in non - magnetic dne and ips determines the time evolution of the x - ray radiation during their outbursts .",
    "the x - ray emission of non - magnetic cvs is believed to originate from regions very close to the wd surface , most likely in a boundary layer . during an outburst , the boundary layer transitions from optically thin to optically thick , which may lead to a suppression of the x - ray flux .",
    "indeed , only a very few non - magnetic dne are known in which the x - ray flux increases during an outburst ( e.g. , u  gem  @xcite ) . in ips",
    "the accretion occurs onto the magnetic poles of the wd , and the boundary layer does not exist .",
    "thus the x - ray flux during an ip outburst is expected to increase .",
    "indeed , such a behaviour was observed in the above - mentioned outbursting ips @xcite .",
    "here we present a comparison of the evolution of the optical and x - ray fluxes during outbursts of two cvs with similar orbital periods , the confirmed ip cc  scl and the ip candidate fs  aur .",
    "cc  scl was discovered as the rosat source rx j2315.5@xmath13049 @xcite and later classified as a dwarf nova @xcite , although no outbursts have yet been detected .",
    "@xcite observed two outbursts of cc  scl , one of which appeared to be a superoutburst due to the detection of superhumps , thus classifying cc  scl as a su  uma - type dwarf nova . from time - resolved spectroscopy , @xcite derived an orbital period of 84.1  min . in 2011 , @xcite performed optical spectroscopic , high - speed photometric and _ swift _ x - ray observations of the superoutburst of the object .",
    "they detected wd spin modulations with a period of 6.49  min which are seen in both optical and x - ray light curves only during the outburst .",
    "thus , cc  scl is a confirmed intermediate polar with one of the shortest orbital periods among ips .",
    "figure 11 in @xcite shows that an x - ray count - rate from cc  scl increased in the outburst . in order to compare the changes in the optical and x - ray energy ranges",
    ", we used the observations published in @xcite .",
    "we note that the x - ray spectrum of cc  scl has changed significantly during the outburst and the following decline , mostly because of changes in the absorption column @xcite . for this reason , in our work we used unabsorbed x - ray fluxes in the energy band 0.310 kev .",
    "they were calculated using the partially - covered cooling flow model described in @xcite .",
    "these fluxes were not published in the paper , but were provided to us by k.  l.  page , whose help is very much appreciated .",
    "we also used the @xmath2 observations of f .-",
    "hambsch which were published in @xcite and stored in the aavso database .",
    "in addition , we extracted the 1-d averaged saao observations from figure 1 in their paper .",
    "the @xmath2 magnitudes were then converted into fluxes and interpolated to the times of the x - ray observations .",
    "fs aur is a peculiar cv showing multiple periodic photometric and spectroscopic variabilities @xcite .",
    "its orbital period of 85.7 min is determined from the radial velocity variations of emission lines @xcite , and is close to that of cc  scl .",
    "the puzzling behaviour of fs  aur is explained within the frame of an enhanced ip scenario with a precessing , fast - rotating magnetically accreting wd @xcite .",
    "the spin period of the wd is expected to be of the order of 50100  s. this hypothesis has received an observation confirmation after finding strong indications that many observed properties of fs aur closely resemble those of other ips @xcite . however , the coherent spin modulations are not yet discovered , thus the ip status of fs  aur is still unconfirmed .",
    "fs  aur shows regular outbursts with a total duration of about 4  d and of relatively low amplitude of @xmath02 mag , with recurrence time of 18.1@xmath32.5  d @xcite .",
    "most of the observed outbursts had very similar light curves .",
    "it is interesting that fs  aur also exhibits strong variability even in quiescence .",
    "for example , @xcite reported that during a 5-month observational campaign in 2010 - 2011 the average quiescent level of the system has increased by 0.30.4 mag .",
    "sometimes fs  aur experiences drops in brightness by about 1.5 mag @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the optical brightness of fs  aur in quiescence varies within a wide range ( 17.415.2  mag ) and these modulations of the light curve are possibly periodic with a @xmath0900-d period .",
    "fs  aur is a rather hard and relatively bright x - ray source .",
    "@xcite reported the x - ray observations of fs  aur obtained with _ rosat _ , _ chandra _ and _ swift _ in quiescence at different optical brightness level .",
    "they noted that the x - ray flux varies proportionally to the optical flux . in order to study this effect in more detail , in this work",
    "we additionally use several new observations obtained recently with _ suzaku _ @xcite and _ swift_. thus , our quiescence data cover about a 1-mag range of optical magnitudes .    in january 2015 , we were lucky to catch fs  aur at the onset of a new outburst , the development of which we traced in detail from the maximum to quiescence .",
    "we obtained 11 nights of optical photometry using the 0.35  m celestron c14 robotic telescope , located at new mexico skies in mayhill , new mexico .",
    "the data were taken with an sbig st-10xme ccd camera and the standard johnson @xmath2 filter .",
    "we were able to start our too _ swift _ x - ray observations at the optical light maximum and we observed until the system returned back to quiescence .",
    "we note that an x - ray count - rate had also increased in the outburst , similarly to cc  scl .",
    "to calculate the x - ray fluxes in the energy band 0.310 kev , we used the three - temperature cooling flow model described in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : lcs ] shows the optical and x - ray light curves of the outbursts of cc  scl ( left - hand panel ) and fs  aur ( right - hand panel ) , and in figs .  [ fig : cc_xopt ] , [ fig : fs_xopt1 ] and [ fig : fs_xopt2 ] we show the optical / x - ray flux diagrams .",
    "the morphology of the optical and x - ray light curves of cc  scl is very similar , resulting in a nearly linear dependence between the x - ray and optical fluxes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cc_xopt ] ) .",
    "however , the outburst amplitude in the x - rays is less than in the optical . in order to characterize the difference in amplitudes of flux variations , we introduce a parameter @xmath4 , the rate of changes of the x - ray and optical fluxes : @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the maximal and minimal x - ray and optical fluxes . for cc  scl , @xmath4@xmath70.62 .",
    "an interesting feature of the optical / x - ray flux diagram is that the fitted line crosses the zero optical flux axis with a non - zero x - ray flux .",
    "this indicates that the dependence between the x - ray and optical fluxes must steepen significantly toward very low accretion rates ( and very low fluxes ) .",
    "the optical and x - ray fluxes of fs  aur in quiescence show a similar dependence with @xmath8@xmath70.71 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fs_xopt1 ] ) .",
    "the fitted line also crosses the zero optical flux axis with a non - zero , positive x - ray flux . during the outburst of fs  aur ,",
    "the dependence between the x - ray and optical fluxes became less steep , though not very significantly ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fs_xopt2 ] ) .",
    "the ratio of the outburst amplitudes in x - rays and the optical is @xmath9@xmath70.47 .",
    "thus , we obtained that during the outbursts of the confirmed ip cc  scl and the ip candidate fs  aur , their x - ray fluxes increased with a similar rate @xmath4 .",
    "this rate is significantly higher than was observed in those normal dwarf novae with a non - magnetic wd , which showed an increase of x - ray flux in outburst .",
    "for example , during an outburst of u  gem @xcite @xmath4 was only about 0.03 .",
    "we investigated the relation between the optical and x - ray fluxes during outbursts of two cvs with similar orbital periods .",
    "we found the following :    1 .",
    "the ratio of the outburst amplitudes in x - rays and the optical in both objects is close to @xmath00.6 , that is significantly larger than in the non - magnetic dwarf nova u  gem .",
    "2 .   the dependence between the x - ray and optical fluxes must steepen significantly toward very low accretion rates and very low fluxes .",
    "similarities in the behaviour of cc  scl and fs  aur indicate strongly the magnetic nature of the wd in fs  aur .    vs thanks deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) for financial support ( grant we 1312/48 - 1 ) . this research has made use of data obtained from the _ suzaku _ satellite , a collaborative mission between the space agencies of japan ( jaxa ) and the usa ( nasa ) .",
