    "is taken up by voids .",
    "the aim of this paper is to describe the non - linear growth of voids out of small initial density and velocity perturbations on a homogeneous background at the moment of last scattering .",
    "we use the inhomogeneous , spherically symmetric dust ( lematre - tolman ) model , an exact solution of einstein s equations .",
    "this paper also reports on the main factors responsible for the formation of voids , and a simulation of void evolution is presented .",
    "as follows from our previous papers ( krasiski and hellaby 2002 , krasiski and hellaby 2004 ) , the final state is sensitive not just to the amplitude , but also to the exact profile of the initial perturbations .",
    "so although velocity perturbations of relative amplitude ( @xmath3 ) around @xmath4 were needed in our models to reproduce realistic voids , it is still possible that other profiles can be found for which a smaller initial velocity amplitude will suffice .",
    "the discovery of large - scale cosmic voids became possible when astronomers started to measure the distribution of galaxies in space .",
    "since william and john herschel s researches , i.e. from xix century , it was known that galaxies cluster ( for example in the virgo or coma cluster ) .",
    "however there could be no certainty that these clusters were not just caused by the galaxies being projected on the celestial sphere .",
    "this changed with the publication of the hubble law in 1929 .",
    "five years later tolman and , immediately after , sen studied the stability of the friedmann models with respect to inhomogeneous perturbations , and concluded that they are unstable against a rarefaction caused by a negative perturbation of either the initial density or the initial velocity .",
    "consequently there should be condensations as well as underdense regions in the universe .",
    "nevertheless it was only at the end of 1970s that voids were discovered .",
    "but the very first sign of their existence had been known 20 years earlier . in 1960",
    "mayall had measured the redshift of 50 galaxies in the coma cluster ( mayall 1960 ) .",
    "his survey covered 33 square degrees of the celestial sphere .",
    "the coma cluster was also studied by chincarini and rood in 1975 , but it was gregory and thompson s ( 1978 ) large survey that ended with the discovery of a void .",
    "their survey covered 260 square degrees of the sky and comprised galaxies up to 15th magnitude , which is equivalent to a radial velocity of approximately 8000 km / s .",
    "also jeveer and einasto ( 1978 ) observed voids in their redshift survey . at the beginning of 1980s the term void was first used to call the regions avoided by galaxies ( rood 1988 ) .",
    "next researchers discovered extremely large regions avoided by galaxies called supervoids .",
    "the classical example is the void discovered by kirshner et al .",
    "( 1981 ) . from the late 1970s",
    ", they were observing the galaxies in the bootes and corona borealis constellation and discovered an almost empty region with the size of 50 - 100 @xmath1 mpc , ( where @xmath5 is the hubble parameter in units of 100 km / s / mpc ) ) .",
    "more up - to - date measurements determine this size to be approximately 60 @xmath1 mpc and prove that this region is not entirely empty .",
    "dey et al .",
    "( 1990 ) observed 21 galaxies within this region and estimated the mean density contrast to be @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the density and mean density of matter in the universe .",
    "other discoveries of voids followed very fast . in 1982 , after a five year survey , the cfa ( center for astrophysics ) galaxy redshift catalogue was finished .",
    "huchra s team measured redshifts for over 2400 galaxies with luminosity below magnitude 14.5 . the amount of data increased in later surveys .",
    "for example , the current sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) covers one - fourth of the celestial sphere and will measure redshifts for over @xmath9 objects .",
    "the size of a void depends on the luminosity of the galaxies that surround it . the research done by lindner et al .",
    "( 1995 ) has shown that the mean void size , as estimated by bright elliptic galaxies , varies between 13 and 36 @xmath1 mpc , whereas the size evaluated by the measurement of fainter galaxies drops to 9  25 @xmath1 mpc .",

    "however , from the above simulations with different background models , it can be seen that if the initial energy density is higher then the final contrast of matter density is deeper .",

    "some possible matter components are : 1 .",
    "cold dark matter , i.e. some form of non - baryonic matter that decouples from normal matter very early on and starts forming structures before last scattering . the amplitude of such fluctuations could be larger than what cmb measurements allow for baryonic matter . whilst there is evidence for some non - luminous matter from galaxy rotation curves , galactic interactions and gravitational lensing , it is less than the required  concordance \" value , and of unknown composition .",
    "the difficulty with this hypothesis is that cold dark matter is not based on any confirmed physical theory and has yet to be detected .",
    "2 .   a radiation component that is still significant just after last scattering .",
    "observations give the galaxy distribution in redshift space , and void sizes are deduced by using a hubble law based on a homogeneous friedmann model . since the density distribution thus obtained is clearly not homogeneous , the use of a friedmann model is really not correct .",
    "this may introduce quite significant errors in the density and velocity profiles of voids .",
    "the well known  finger of god \" effect is an example of a large discrepancy between true positions , and the friedmann - based mapping from redshift space to physical distances .",
    "consistency with einstein s equations requires use of an inhomogeneous cosmological model to correctly map redshift space into physical distances and thus determine how velocities vary with distance . at present",
    ", neither the density distribution nor the velocity field of galaxies is known with confidence .",
    "had we known both these fields with a reasonable precision , we might use the l ",
    "t model to _ calculate _ the fluctuations in density and velocity at recombination .",
    ".   reliable measurements of temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation are available only for angular scales larger than 0.5@xmath85 ( see fig , [ wmap ] ) , with the scatter becoming large at 0.2@xmath86 .",
    "on the other hand , as shown in paper i ( krasiski and hellaby 2004 ) and in sec .",
    "[ ladiam ] , the angular diameters , in the cmb sky , of structures the right size to evolve into voids , are less than 0.25@xmath85 . though current theory suggests the amplitude decreases at smaller scales , this has yet to be confirmed by improved cmb temperature measurements . 6 .",
    "solid observational data give the temperature fluctuation of the cosmic microwave background radiation at present , @xmath87 , separately for different modes of perturbation .",
    "however , there are several factors contributing to @xmath87 ( see section [ infl ] ) , which may partially cancel each other .",
    "we were interested in the magnitude of the fluid velocity at last scattering , as an initial condition for our models , but we were not able to locate a formula relating the fluid velocity to the observed @xmath87 .",
    "thus our estimate of @xmath88 may be inaccurate . we ourselves do not plan to enter this field",
    ", however we would welcome an explicit calculation with a reliable result .",
    ".   the universe may be much older than currently believed , making the time available for void formation much longer .",
    "this would require adjustment of the matter content of the universe , of the value of the cosmological constant or of the value of the hubble constant , each of which may affect the structure - formation timescale .",
    "general relativity ( gr ) may not be the right theory of the evolution of the universe .",
    "there is certainly no lack of proposed modifications or alternatives .",
    "while some would gladly accept this conclusion , and no - one can claim with certainty that gr will survive all future scrutiny , we wish to stress that gr has a much stronger experimental basis than any cosmic structure formation theory .",
