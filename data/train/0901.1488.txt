    "<S> historically , most of the concepts of quantum information and computation have been first developed in the qubit regime , and more recently generalized to a cv scenario where very promising perspectives have been acknowledged concerning both general theoretical insights and experimental realizations @xcite , due to the relative simplicity and high efficiency in the generation , manipulation , and detection of special classes of cv states , gaussian states @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> here we introduce a general multipartite communication primitive  the ` quantum teamwork '  that can not be implemented perfectly with @xmath0-qubit resources beyond the threshold @xmath1 . on the contrary , we identify families of gaussian multipartite cv entangled states of an arbitrary number of modes which remarkably enable the unconditional transmission of multimode quantum states between two teams of arbitrarily arranged parties over quantum networks . </S>",

    "<S> the parties carry their share of the entangled resource and the two teams independently proceed in the investigation . </S>",

    "<S> suppose team @xmath7 wishes to communicate some undisclosed information to team @xmath8 . </S>",

    "<S> we have just introduced an instance of _ quantum `` teamwork''_. it is a very powerful and practical primitive that generalizes conventional quantum teleportation @xcite and multipartite teleportation networks @xcite and promises to be of many uses in quantum technology implementations . </S>",
    "<S> crucial for the feasibility of quantum teamworks are the multipartite entangled resources @xmath12 distributed to the parties at each briefing . above </S>",
    "<S> , we assumed different resources be needed at each step @xmath13 , adapted on the team configuration . </S>",
    "<S> this would however require some control at the station level , i.e. over the initialization of the protocol , posing a drawback to its versatility . </S>",
    "<S> we raise then an intriguing question : do universal resources exist that enable the unconditional realization of quantum teamworks for _ any _ arrangement of the two teams ? </S>",

    "<S> if one restricts the search for @xmath14 to states of @xmath0 qubits , however , one has in general a negative answer . </S>",
    "<S> consider e.g. @xmath17 : while protocols for teleporting an arbitrary state of two qubits via either two bell pairs @xcite or a genuinely four - qubit multipartite entangled state @xcite exist , they can not work for unit fidelity for all of the three possible splittings of four parties into two two - party teams . </S>",
    "<S> the most suitable qubit resource states to implement quantum teamworks would be the perfect `` maximally multipartite entangled states '' ( mmes ) recently studied by facchi _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which are those @xmath0-qubit states states @xmath18 that can be written in schmidt form as @xmath19 across any @xmath20 partition where the block @xmath7 is made of @xmath3 qubits . </S>",
    "<S> they have the defining property of exhibiting the maximum allowed bipartite entanglement for all possible splittings . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been proven that qubit perfect mmes do not exist for @xmath17 and for all @xmath21 , indicating the strong presence of an entanglement frustration as complexity increases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nontrivial quantum teamwork instances can hence be faithfully implemented only among @xmath22 or @xmath23 parties ( the case @xmath24 is still unsettled @xcite ) when each party is allotted a single qubit .    </S>",
    "<S> _ perfect maximally multipartite entangled states for continuous variables._ in a cv scenario , one could translitterate the notion of mmes in a weak sense , by looking for states whose bipartite entanglements are simultaneously diverging across all bipartitions . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to find cv states which meet these requirements , the most prominent examples being the ghz - type ( ghz stands for greenberger - horne - zeilinger ) permutation - invariant gaussian states @xcite of @xmath0 modes , in the limit of infinite local squeezing . </S>",
    "<S> however , for any bipartition these states are locally equivalent to a single maximally entangled state [ einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pair ] and as such only enable a very limiting case of quantum teamwork , where @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> this special instance of teleporting arbitrary single - mode states from any sender to any receiver , the latter acting cooperatively with @xmath26 assisting parties , was already introduced as a ` quantum teleportation network ' @xcite and has been demonstrated experimentally for @xmath27 @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we go beyond these limitations by identifying @xmath0-mode cv gaussian resources which are locally equivalent to a maximal number of epr pairs for any partition , thus enabling unconditional quantum teamworks , and properly embodying the stronger notion of ` perfect ' cv mmes . </S>",
    "<S> precisely , we define a perfect cv mmes as a ( not necessarily gaussian ) @xmath0-mode state such that , with respect to any @xmath20 partition where the block @xmath7 is made of @xmath3 modes , it can be transformed by local unitaries into the tensor product of exactly @xmath3 epr pairs ( and @xmath16 uncorrelated single - mode states ) . </S>",
    "<S> clearly such a state has infinite energy and stands as an idealized unphysical limit , therefore the notion of perfect cv mmes has to be understood in the sense of a family of states , depending on a parameter ( for instance , a local squeezing degree ) , which converge asymptotically to the ideal perfect cv mmes when the parameter is very large . </S>",
    "<S> each member of the family , characterized by a finite value of the parameter , would be an imperfect approximation of the perfect cv mmes , but crucially this approximation can be made arbitrarily precise .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall look for perfect cv mmes within the family of gaussian weighted graph states of a @xmath0-mode cv system . </S>",
    "<S> gaussian states , up to local displacements , are completely specified by the covariance matrix @xmath28 of the second canonical moments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a weighted graph gaussian state @xmath18 is a pure @xmath0-mode gaussian state whose covariance matrix is defined in terms of a local squeezing degree @xmath29 , and associated to a weighted @xmath0-vertex graph @xmath30 with adjacency matrix @xmath31 via a canonical prescription @xcite , as detailed in the supplementary material @xcite . for any splitting of the modes into a @xmath3-mode block owned by party @xmath7 and a @xmath32-mode block owned by party @xmath8 ( recall that @xmath33 ) , any pure @xmath0-mode gaussian state @xmath34 is equivalent , up to local ( with respect to the bipartition ) gaussian unitary operations , to the tensor product of @xmath35 entangled two - mode squeezed states @xmath36 and additional @xmath37 uncorrelated single - mode vacua @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the two - mode squeezed states @xmath38 ( with @xmath39 ) are prototypical cv states which reproduce infinitely entangled epr pairs in the limit @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the number @xmath41 of entangled two - mode squeezed states in the normal form of a pure @xmath0-mode gaussian state for a given partition is given by the symplectic rank of its reduced @xmath3-mode covariance matrix @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in the case of weighted graph gaussian states , by writing the adjacency matrix @xmath31 in block form with respect to the @xmath20 partition , @xmath42 , one has @xmath43 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , by construction , for these states , the two - mode squeezed pairs appearing in the normal form all simultaneously converge to epr pairs for a diverging @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we obtain the following powerful and simple criterion : a pure @xmath0-mode gaussian weighted graph state with adjacency matrix @xmath31 is a perfect cv mmes in the limit of infinite local squeezing if and only if all the @xmath45 off - diagonal block submatrices @xmath46 have matrix rank @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ how quantum teamwork works._ we are ready to provide examples of gaussian resources useful for quantum teamworks . </S>",
    "<S> we first observe that the direct analogues of perfect qubit mmes for @xmath47 @xcite , described by unweighted , partially connected graphs , are perfect cv mmes , as one would expect . for @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> no perfect qubit mmes exist @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we disclosed several instances of four - mode cv perfect mmes . </S>",
    "<S> one such instance is provided by ( the infinite - squeezing limit of ) a gaussian state @xmath48 with irreducible three - party correlations which has been recently introduced @xcite and experimentally demonstrated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is defined by the action of a beam splitter on two beams each taken from a two - mode squeezed state , @xmath49 $ ] , where @xmath50 is a beam splitter transformation with transmittivity @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> this state is locally equivalent to the four - mode ring weighted cv graph state depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figfid](a ) .    for the resource @xmath48 it is instructive to illustrate the explicit steps needed for the teleportation of arbitrary two - mode states from any two parties paired as team @xmath7 to the remaining two parties of team @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath52 the only local operation required to obtain 2 two - mode squeezed entangled pairs is obviously an inverse beam splitter with transmittivity @xmath51 on the @xmath8 modes . if @xmath53 both teams have to locally mix their respective modes at a @xmath54 beam splitter , and further apply local squeezing operations , with squeezing @xmath55 on modes @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and @xmath58 on modes @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( @xmath61^{1/4}$ ] ) , to reproduce a dual entangled channel . if @xmath62 the same steps are required but with the following modifications , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> suppose now a random arrangement is chosen for the two teams , and team @xmath7 wishes to teleport an arbitrary two - mode ( entangled ) state , e.g. a two - mode squeezed state @xmath65 , to team @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> after the local operations described above , each input mode is independently teleported according to the conventional braunstein - kimble scheme @xcite using the corresponding two - mode squeezed entangled pair @xcite , and finally team @xmath8 obtains the two - mode state @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity @xmath67 between input and output reads @xmath68 depending on both the input squeezing @xmath69 and the effective squeezing @xmath70 of the two entangled pairs in the normal form of @xmath48 relative to the partition @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> for any finite @xmath69 , @xmath74 , and @xmath40 , in which limit the entangled channels reproduce exactly epr pairs , the fidelity converges to unity for all bipartitions [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figfid](b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is an _ unconditional _ realization of quantum teamwork communication for @xmath17 , experimentally feasible with current optical technology @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> more examples of perfect cv mmes are provided in the supplementary material @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ typicality of continuous variable perfect maximally multipartite entangled states._ we may now attempt an estimate of the volume occupied by perfect cv mmes in the space of pure gaussian states for arbitrary @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced symplectic eigenvalues @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) of the @xmath3-mode covariance matrix @xmath77 of a generic @xmath0-mode pure - state covariance matrix @xmath78 , corresponding to any block @xmath7 , are a continuous analytic function of the real elements of the covariance matrix @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the set of states which certainly fail to be perfect mmes , characterized by one or more @xmath79 , is of null measure . </S>",
    "<S> if we specialize to weighted graph gaussian states , where by construction if all @xmath80 then they all diverge for infinite local squeezing , we can conclude that perfect cv mmes families are henceforth _ typical _ @xcite in the space of ( weighted graph ) pure gaussian states , in the sense that randomly picked ( weighted graph ) pure gaussian states for an arbitrary number of modes are expected to reproduce perfect mmes for diverging local squeezing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we tested the typicality argument by a numerical construction of pure @xmath0-mode gaussian states described by ( generally complete ) graphs associated to a symmetric adjacency matrix @xmath31 with null principal diagonal and random off - diagonal integer weights @xmath81 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , we found instances of perfect cv mmes at the first run for each @xmath0 ( we tested up to @xmath82 ) . </S>",
    "<S> an example for @xmath83 is presented in the supplementary material @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned , notable exceptions lying in the null - measure set of non - perfect mmes are the cv ghz - type states @xcite , associated to fully connected unweighted graphs . </S>",
    "<S> as soon as the symmetry is broken and some randomness is plugged in the interaction weights , perfect maximal multipartite entanglement pronouncedly arises in cv gaussian states , which are thus unaffected by the entanglement frustration featuring in complex many - body low dimensional systems @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ applications and remarks on practical implementations._ perfect cv mmes stand as promising resources for operating the `` quantum internet '' @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all gaussian weighted graph states , including perfect cv mmes , are efficiently engineerable with off - line squeezers and linear optics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let us also recall that several classes of cluster states , belonging to the family of ( weighted ) graph gaussian states @xcite , are proven universal resources for cv one - way quantum computation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> given the typicality of perfect cv mmes , we may expect that suitable graph structures exist for arbitrarily large @xmath0 such to achieve both the universality for quantum computation @xcite and the cv mmes property . by construction , </S>",
    "<S> perfect cv mmes enable the creation of epr pairs between any two modes , and have unbounded entanglement width scaling linearly with @xmath0 , thus fulfilling the necessary conditions for efficient universality @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , perfect cv mmes automatically enable faithful `` disk operations '' such as cut & paste of large sectors of stored data . here </S>",
    "<S> the input data are encoded in the state of multiple atomic ensembles , team @xmath7 owns the light modes interacting with the source units , and team @xmath8 controls the target storage units . building on the demonstrations of quantum memory and teleportation from light to matter and viceversa @xcite , unconditional reallocation of multimode data ( up to half the total disk space ) can be performed with our scheme . </S>",
    "<S> perfect cv mmes for @xmath0 modes enable moreover data compression in the form of multipartite dense coding to transmit @xmath0-way classical signals simultaneously @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further applications include quantum secret / state sharing @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> clearly , any implementation will be affected by experimental imperfections , mainly traceable to the usage of a finite degree of squeezing in the preparation of the teamwork resources , which are in practice imperfect approximations of perfect cv mmes . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a non - unit fidelity in the transmission ( as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fidelity4](b ) for finite @xmath44 , where e.g @xmath84 for @xmath85  db of resource squeezing ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ensuing inefficiency of the protocol propagates with the number @xmath3 of input modes to be teleported between the two teams . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , suppose the teamwork resource is a weighted graph state of @xmath86 modes , locally reducible to a tensor product of @xmath3 two - mode squeezed states , with squeezing @xmath44 , across any partition into two blocks of @xmath3 modes each . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider as input state a @xmath3-mode ghz - type symmetric state with local squeezing @xmath69 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> each mode of the input state is individually teleported via a corresponding approximate epr channel . </S>",
    "<S> the overall teamwork fidelity @xmath87 scales exponentally with @xmath3 , as @xmath88^k \\le { \\cal f}_k \\le { { \\cal f}_1}^k$ ] , where @xmath89 is the fidelity @xcite for teleporting a single - mode vacuum via a two - mode squeezed state with squeezing @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that if @xmath90 ( quasi - perfect cv mmes resource ) then the performance is slightly affected by a larger input size , while for moderate ( realistic ) squeezing @xmath44 in the resource the performance can be quickly degraded with @xmath3 , and the degradation is enforced by the amount of entanglement in the input state ( in this case , @xmath69 ) . </S>",
    "<S> suitable generalizations and optimizations of the conventional braunstein - kimble teleportation scheme @xcite , which is a building block of our networked scheme , might result in improved efficiencies for a given , finite resource squeezing degree . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is beyond the scope of this work , and we remark that the conceptual relevance of our results stays solid .    </S>",
    "<S> the demonstration advanced in this letter of the powerful features of quantum teamwork protocols , peculiar of cv systems and structurally precluded to many - qubit scenarios , opens an avenue for the deep investigation of the characteristic traits of high - dimensional multipartite entanglement , and their exploitation to convey multimedia information over a global quantum communication web .    </S>",
