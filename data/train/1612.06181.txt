    "in the era of big data inferring features of complex systems , characterized by many degrees of freedom , is of crucial importance .",
    "the high - dimensional setting , where the number of features to extract is not small compared to the number of available data , makes this task statistically or computationally hard .",
    "one case of practical interest is the inference of the largest component ( eigenvector ) of correlation matrices .",

    "i.e. _ such that the population covariance matrix @xmath2 is not the identity matrix .",
    "if @xmath0 is much larger than @xmath1 the empirical covariance matrix @xmath3 computed from the @xmath0 observations converges to @xmath2 , and recovering the top eigenvector is easy .",
    "the case where both @xmath4 are large ( sent to infinity at fixed ratio @xmath5 ) has received a lot of attention , both theoretically and practically @xcite . from a theoretical point of view , it has been shown , in the case of a covariance matrix @xmath2 with one ( or few compared to @xmath1 ) eigenvalues larger than unity , say , @xmath6 , that recovery is possible if @xmath7 is smaller than the critical value @xmath8 @xcite . for larger sampling noise ( @xmath9 ) , the top eigenvector of @xmath10 is essentially orthogonal to the top component of @xmath2 , and is therefore not informative .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the situation will improve in the presence of additional , prior information about the structure of the top component to be recovered , and that recovery will be possible even when @xmath7 is ( not too much ) larger than @xmath11 . that this is indeed the case has been rigorously shown when",
    "all entries are nonnegative @xcite , and is supported by strong numerical evidence when the top component is known to have large entries ( finite as @xmath12 ) @xcite . in the present work , using techniques from statistical physics we propose explicit conjectures about the critical noise level and its dependence on the signal eigenvalue ( @xmath6 ) and on prior knowledge .",
    "the framework is general and can be applied to any kind of entry - wise prior probability , _",
    "i.e. _ factorized over the entries @xmath13 of the top component @xmath14 .",
    "we show how rigorous results in the nonnegative case of @xcite are recovered , and present new results for the large entry prior .    the motivation to consider the latter prior stems from computational biology , more precisely , from the study of coevolution between amino acids in protein families .",
    "sequences of proteins diverged from a common ancestor widely differ across many organisms , while the protein structure and function are often very well conserved .",
    "the constraints induced by structural and functional conservation manifest themselves as correlations between amino acids ( the @xmath1 variables , where @xmath1 is the protein length ) across the different organisms ( the @xmath0 observations ) .",
    "recently , it was shown that the eigenmodes @xmath14 of the amino - acid covariance matrix corresponding to _ low _ eigenvalues were informative about three - dimensional contacts on the protein structure @xcite .",
    "these modes show large entries on the protein sites and amino - acid types in contact ; as the other entries contain diffuse , non - structural signal @xcite , the components @xmath14 can not be thought of as being sparse .",
    "the presence of large entries in structurally - informative components was empirically assessed through the so - called inverse participation ratio , @xmath15 ( for normalized @xmath14 ) , a quantity that remains finite for components with ( few ) large entries and otherwise vanishes for @xmath12 .",

    "however , it is convenient to consider @xmath31 as a free parameter .",
    "the @xmath33 limit corresponds to maximum likelihood inference , while working at low values of @xmath31 may be useful to ensure rapid mixing of monte carlo markov chain sampling of distribution @xmath34 , especially in the presence of prior information , see below .",
