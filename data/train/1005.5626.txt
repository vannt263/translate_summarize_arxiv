    "quantum magnetism is one of the oldest central problems in condensed matter and many body physics .",
    "few exact results are known except at one dimension or when long range spin order is established at low temperature . in the later case , landau s symmetry breaking paradigm",
    "is applicable , and the long range spin order determines the low energy physics of the system .",
    "the low energy spin excitations are spin waves or magnons.@xcite systematic corrections to spin wave theory can be obtained through semiclassical approach ( @xmath10 expansion@xcite ) and/or nonlinear @xmath11 model.@xcite however , it was suggested that for some anti - ferromagnetic materials , strong quantum fluctuations due to small spin magnitude and low dimensionality combined with geometric frustration may lead to quantum coherent , spin disordered ground states.@xcite in such cases , a quantum fluid approach@xcite is probably a better starting point to describe the low energy physics instead of usual spin wave or semiclassical approach .",
    "there exist at present two common quantum fluid approaches based on different  particle \" representations of spins . in the  bosonic \"",
    "approach@xcite spins are represented by spin up and down schwinger bosons with the constraint that total boson number at each site is @xmath12 .",
    "a spin - disordered state is obtained in a mean field theory as long as bose condensation does not occur .",
    "the low lying excitations coming from this theory are bosonic .",
    "the other possibility is to represent spins by fermions . up to now ,",
    "the fermionic approach is mainly restricted to @xmath0 spin systems@xcite . because of the pauli exclusion principle , we can not put more than two spin up or down fermions on a site to form @xmath2 objects as in bosonic approach .",
    "one way out is to introduce more species of fermions .",
    "it was proposed in ref .  , that @xmath13-species of boson / fermions can be used to construct the spin-@xmath5 swapping operators .",
    "later , it is shown that the fermionic representation can be used to describe a @xmath3 valence bond solid state.@xcite    in this paper , we systematically study the fermionic representation for arbitrary spins . to construct a spin operator with spin magnitude @xmath5 , we follow ref .   and introduce different fermion operators for different @xmath14 states .",
    "we find that for half - odd - integer spins , the spin operator thus constructed is invariant under a @xmath15 transformations,@xcite i.e. the symmetry group is @xmath15 group whereas for integer spins the symmetry group is @xmath16 .",
    "fermionic path integral formulations for spin systems with arbitrary spin-@xmath5 can then be formulated and the corresponding mean field theories can be studied .",
    "we shall see that one of the mean field theories applied to 1d antiferromagnetic heisenberg model produces mean field excitation spectrums which agrees with haldane s conjecture.@xcite moreover , there exist zero energy majorana edge modes for open integer spin chains .",
    "we also apply our approach to two - dimensional ( 2d ) antiferromagnetic heisenberg models on triangular lattices where we obtain two translational and rotational invariant spin liquid solutions , one ( with @xmath6-wave paring symmetry ) is gapped and the other one ( with @xmath7-wave pairing symmetry ) has nodes at the spinon fermi level .",
    "comparing with experiments on @xmath17 , we argue that the @xmath7-wave pairing spin liquid is a plausible ground state .",
    "it should be noted that rather different fermionic / bosonic spinon approaches have also been applied to @xmath18 spin models where the dynamic symmetry is generalized from @xmath15 to @xmath18 , and the hamiltonian is composed of @xmath18 generators .. in these approaches , @xmath19-species of particles are introduced to construct the @xmath18-spin operator and hamiltonians .",
    "the major difference between our approach and the @xmath18 approaches is that @xmath13 species of fermions are introduced to form a @xmath15-spin ( or irreducible representation of @xmath15 group ) in our approach . unlike the @xmath18 models ,",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the general fermionic spinon representation for arbitrary spin @xmath5 and discuss the symmetry properties associated with the representation . in section iii , we introduce the path integral formalism where different ways of imposing particle number constraints are presented .",
