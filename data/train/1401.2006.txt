    "et al . _ , 2004 ) indeed corresponds to the case @xmath6 , where the dry - air potential temperature is equal to @xmath7 the @xmath4 thinking popularized by h85 makes use of this formulation which demonstrates at the same time a lagrangian conservation property and a principle of invertibility for adiabatic , reversible and frictionless motion of dry air .",
    "the reason why the choice of @xmath6 annihilates the solenoidal term in the first line of the r.h.s . of ( [ def_dpvdt_psi ] ) is that @xmath8 can be expressed in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath9 only , according to the dry - air equation of state which may be written @xmath10 the second line in the r.h.s . of ( [ def_dpvdt_psi ] ) also cancels out for the adiabatic , reversible and frictionless motion of dry air , because the first term depends on the material derivative of @xmath8 and is equal to zero since the dry - air entropy @xmath11 corresponds to the property @xmath12 .",
    "the last term of ( [ def_dpvdt_psi ] ) depends on the curl of the friction force and it vanishes for frictionless motion . as a consequence , the material derivative ( [ def_dpvdt_psi ] ) is indeed equal to zero for @xmath13 and during the reversible , adiabatic and frictionless motion of a parcel of dry air .",
    "ertel s formulation is often used to study the thermodynamical properties of moist atmosphere , though it is based on @xmath8 and not on a moist counterpart .",
    "it is assumed that the impact of water phase change can be represented by the diabatic term @xmath14 ( i.e. condensation - evaporation and radiative processes ) .",
    "however , the corresponding inversion method does not generate tendencies for water species and the anomalies of @xmath15 are of small amplitude in the lower troposphere , creating difficulties for ( or even an impossibility of ) the analsis of the signals associated with frontal or convective moist systems .    in order to avoid these drawbacks ,",
    "moist versions of the potential vorticity have been used in studies of atmospheric systems .",
    "various moist formulations of @xmath4 have been built and tested by following the advice of h85 , with @xmath0 replaced by the wet bulb ( @xmath16 ) , moist entropic ( @xmath17 ) , equivalent ( @xmath18 ) , saturation equivalent ( @xmath19 ) or virtual ( @xmath20 ) potential temperatures .",
    "bennetts and hoskins ( 1979 , hereafter referred to as bh79 ) and emanuel ( 1979 , 1983 ) have investigated the generation of conditional symmetric instability in baroclinic systems as a possible mechanism for the formation of frontal rain - bands . it is suggested that negative moist potential vorticity computed with either @xmath21 , @xmath18 or @xmath19 is a sufficient condition for two - dimensional frictionless conditional symmetric instability . however , none of these potential temperatures fulfills the demand to verify , at the same time , a moist conservative property and an invertibility principle .",
    "more precisely , it is shown in s01 and schubert ( 2004 , hereafter referred to as s04 ) that , even if the equivalent potential temperatures @xmath18 or @xmath19 are approximately conserved during the motions of parcels of moist saturated air , and as far as the moist entropy may indeed be approximated by @xmath22 or @xmath23 , the solenoidal term in the first line of the r.h.s .",
    "of ( [ def_dpvdt_psi ] ) does not cancels out .",
    "this is an cumbersome source / sink term which can not be associated with any conservative law . moreover , @xmath24 do not verify an invertibility principle .    in a symmetric way",
    ", it is shown in s01 and s04 that the choice of the virtual potential temperature @xmath25 annihilates the solenoidal term in ( [ def_dpvdt_psi ] ) and that @xmath26 demonstrates an invertibility principle .",
    "however , the corresponding diabatic term @xmath27 does not receive a clear physical interpretation , since it does not correspond to any moist conservative law .",
    "in fact , @xmath28 is the key quantity used for buoyancy analyses , but it can not be related to the moist entropy or to the second law , or to the conservation of matter for the mixing of dry air and total water species .",
    "it is mentioned in davies and wernli ( 1997 ) that the @xmath4 perspective is founded in three notions : + i ) @xmath4 conservation in the adiabatic and frictionless limit ; + ii ) @xmath4 inversion in the balance - flow limit to obtain the associated flow and thermal pattern ; + iii ) @xmath4 partition of the field into coherent distinctive elements of potential vorticity and potential temperature .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to explore mainly the third notion .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "existing moist potential vorticities are described in section  [ section_moist_pv ] .",
    "the main properties of the specific moist entropy , computed in m11 in terms of @xmath29 , are described in section  [ section_moist_s ] .",
    "the new moist potential vorticity @xmath30 is defined in section  [ section_pvs ] , together with the virtual component @xmath31 and with the justification for the use of a corresponding new potential vorticity unit ( pvus ) . an approximate formulation for @xmath30",
    "is derived in appendix  b , which uses the approximation of @xmath29 by @xmath32 described in m11 .",
    "the numerical experimentation is introduced in section  [ section_numerical_model ] , where some isobaric and iso-@xmath4 charts are shown .",
    "the cross - sections of potential temperatures are presented in section  [ section_cross_theta ] .",
    "isobaric charts and cross - sections of the new potential vorticity components are depicted in section  [ section_pv_charts ] and [ section_pv_cross ] , respectively .",
    "the possibility that the paradigm of slantwise convection may be revisited by the use of @xmath30 and @xmath29 is analyzed in section  [ section_slantwise ] .",
    "charts of low - levels potential vorticity are shown in section  [ section_pv_series ] for a large northern midlatitudes atlantic domain and for two successive forecasts .",
    "hints for next inversion methods based on the use of @xmath30 are described in section  [ section_inversion_method ] and in appendices  c and d , for both non - saturated and saturated moist air .",
    "use of new water component is suggested defined by @xmath33 which highlight the negative lower - level @xmath4 signals associated with moist processes .",
    "it is explained that the magnitude of negative values and of solenoidal terms are smaller with the use of @xmath29 than with the use of @xmath18 , two interesting features which could motivate a revival of interest in the search for a moist - air inversion tool applied directly to @xmath30 .",
    "finally , conclusions and outlines are presented in section  [ section_conclude ] .",
    "the possibility of defining moist generalizations of ertel s potential vorticity has been investigated by many authors .    the wet bulb potential temperature was used in bh79 to define the potential vorticity as @xmath34 in fact , @xmath16 is conserved only during pseudo - adiabatic ascents of a saturated and precipitating convective parcel .",
    "the conservative property verified by @xmath16 corresponds to irreversible processes of open systems , during which the condensed water is continuously removed from the parcels , resulting in the non - conservation of the moist entropy ( a part of which is withdrawn by the precipitations ) .",
    "rivas soriano and garca dez ( 1997 ) replaced @xmath16 by the entropic potential temperature defined in hauf and hller ( 1987 ) , in order to take into account the impact of ice water .",
    "the resulting potential vorticity is written as @xmath35 where the specific moist entropy is defined by @xmath36 .",
    "the drawback of this formulation is that the terms @xmath37 and @xmath38 both depend on @xmath39 , and thus vary with the total water mixing ratio .",
    "the consequence is that the entropic potential temperature @xmath40 is not trully synonymous with the moist entropy , and @xmath41 can not establish a general second - law conservative property ( see m11 ) .    in geostrophic coordinates , the moist potential vorticity is defined in emanuel _ et al . _",
    "( 1987 ) with the saturation moist entropy @xmath42 expressed by @xmath43 , where the equivalent potential vorticity is written in terms of this saturation equivalent potential temperature @xmath19 , leading to @xmath44     \\label{def_theta_es } \\ : .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the moist generalizations @xmath45 and @xmath24 are tested in s01 , where the virtual potential temperature is defined by @xmath46 and the equivalent potential temperature by @xmath47 the equivalent entropy @xmath42 appearing in ( [ def_theta_e ] ) is determined according to emanuel ( 1994 ) .",
    "it is expressed by two different formulas , depending on saturation or non - saturation conditions .",
    "the moist - air equation of state is expressed in s01 in terms of the virtual potential temperature , leading to @xmath48 the important property described in s01 is that @xmath20 given by ( [ def_moist_theta_vl ] ) only depends on @xmath2 and @xmath9 , as in ( [ def_dry_theta ] ) for the dry - air formulation @xmath8 . as a consequence the solenoidal term cancels out in ( [ def_dpvdt_psi ] ) for @xmath49 .",
    "the corresponding moist @xmath4 is defined in s01 by @xmath50    it is then demonstrated in s01 and s04 that @xmath45 follows an invertibility principle , indicating that the virtual potential temperature may be a good candidate to build a moist version for the potential vorticity . however , the main drawback of the choice of @xmath49 is that the material derivative of @xmath20 does not correspond to a conservative property .",
    "indeed , the gradient of @xmath51 can not be linked to the change in moist entropy , or to the conservation of dry air and water species , for instance . as a result , the second line in the r.h.s . of the pv equation ( [ def_dpvdt_psi ] )",
    "does not cancel out for @xmath49 .",
    "it is suggested in s01 and s04 that it is possible to overcome this drawback by defining the moist pv equation ( [ def_dpvdt_psi ] ) with @xmath52 or @xmath19 .",
    "indeed , the material derivative @xmath53 or @xmath54 could be equal to zero for two different reasons .",
    "this might be true for adiabatic and reversible processes if @xmath18 or @xmath19 were valid measurements of the moist air entropy .",
    "this assumption is made for instance in emanuel _ et al . _",
    "( 1987 ) , with a moist entropy implicitly defined by @xmath55 the two terms @xmath56 and @xmath57 represent additional terms which are either constant or depends on @xmath58 , with @xmath58 also assumed to be a constant conservative quantity .",
    "however , neither @xmath18 nor @xmath19 are valid measurements of the more general moist - air specific entropy , as shown in m11 .",
    "the main problem is that @xmath59 and @xmath58 are located outside the logarithm of @xmath18 in ( [ def_s_e94 ] ) and that a source of variability due to @xmath60 is thus missing in @xmath18 .",
    "another impact of varying @xmath59 and @xmath58 in ( [ def_s_e94 ] ) is that @xmath61 and @xmath62 become variable terms which can not be neglected , even if @xmath56 or @xmath57 were true constant terms .",
    "moreover , @xmath63 is replaced by @xmath64 in emanuel ( 1994 ) , with the impact of @xmath65 also missing in @xmath18 .    the facts that @xmath18 or @xmath19 are considered as conserved quantities , and that the material derivatives are almost equal to zero , correspond to pseudo - adiabatic conservative properties which are demonstrated by the potential temperature @xmath16 in convective or frontal regions .",
    "it is assumed that the liquid water droplets or ice crystals are withdrawn from cloud in the form of precipitations species as far as they are created by condensation processes .",
    "these are irreversible kind of processes , and parts of the entropy are withdrawn by precipitation .",
    "the consequence is that the conservative properties assumed for @xmath18 or @xmath19 do not correspond to the second law of thermodynamics applied to a specific parcel of moist air .",
    "it corresponds to the change in entropy expressed per unit mass of dry air of a moist parcel , and so making it useless for applications to a barycentric vision and to the computation of material derivatives of moist air .",
    "another drawback linked to the choices of @xmath24 or @xmath66 is that the associated solenoidal terms does not cancel out , and that these equivalent potential vorticities are not invertible .",
    "another `` saturation equivalent '' potential temperature @xmath67 is defined in s04 .",
    "it is built in order to cancel the solenoidal term , and like @xmath28 it is invertible under balanced conditions , but it does not have the correct limit in the dry - air case ",
    "i.e. @xmath15  making it `` useless for general applications '' , according to the author .    taking into consideration the advantages and drawbacks described in s01 and s04 , the method followed in the next section will consist of modifying the existing moist air approaches by seeking a new specific ( i.e. per unit of moist air ) @xmath0 function to be put into ( [ def_pv_psi ] ) and ( [ def_dpvdt_psi ] ) and which could satisfy moist conservative properties ( i.e. for which changes in material derivative are caused by pure diabatic processes ) .",
    "the aim of the present article is to express the formulation ( [ def_pv_psi ] ) in terms of the specific moist air entropy , namely with @xmath68 .",
    "the moist air entropy is expressed in m11 in terms of a potential temperature @xmath69 , according to the relationships @xmath70 the formulation ( [ def_s_ln_theta_s ] ) provides a definition ( [ def_ths ] ) for @xmath69 which is different from the definition obtained for @xmath71 from ( [ def_theta_e ] ) .",
    "the dimensionless @xmath72-term is defined in m11 by @xmath73 this term @xmath72 depends on the difference between the reference values @xmath74 and @xmath75 for dry air and water vapour , respectively .",
    "therefore @xmath72 depends on the reference values @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "however , it is explained in m11 that the other terms in the full formulation ( [ def_ths ] ) rearrange so that @xmath79 is really independent on the reference values .",
    "it is thus equivalent to the specific moist - air entropy state function and it may be computed locally .    a justification for studying @xmath79 as a relevant meteorological variable is given in m11 .",
    "investigations of the thermodynamical internal structure of several marine stratocumulus demonstrate that , even if the clear - air and in - cloud vertical profiles of the basic variables are not homogeneous , the vertical gradients of thermal and water content properties combine so that the moist entropy and @xmath79 are almost constant within the pbl and the top - pbl entrainment region .",
    "it is shown in m11 and in marquet and geleyn ( 2013 ) that @xmath79 can be accurately represented by the approximation @xmath80 given by ( [ def_theta_s1 ] ) and with the typical value of about @xmath81 for @xmath72 .",
    "if ice water content is zero , this approximate formulation only depends on the two well - known moist conservative variables @xmath82 and @xmath58 ( betts , 1973 ) , with the result @xmath83    in order to avoid misinterpretations , the exact formula ( [ def_ths ] ) for @xmath79 will be used in the next sections to define and compute the new moist potential vorticity components @xmath84 , denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "the small impact of the approximation of @xmath79 by @xmath85 will be demonstrated by comparing the corresponding exact and approximate versions of @xmath30 in section  [ section_pv_cross ] and in appendix  b.",
    "the aim of this section is to compare the formulation @xmath45 studied in s01 with a new formulation @xmath84 computed with the moist entropy given by ( [ def_s_ln_theta_s])-([def_lambda ] ) .    since @xmath63 and @xmath86 are constant terms , the quantity @xmath84 is equal to @xmath87 $ ] .",

    "<S> a new potential vorticity is derived by using a specific entropy formulation expressed in terms of a moist - air entropy potential temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the new formulation is compared with ertel s version and with others based on virtual and equivalent potential temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the new potential vorticity is subject to conservative properties ensured by the second law applied to the moist - air material derivatives . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the upper tropospheric and stratospheric ( dry ) structures are nearly the same as those obtained with ertel s component . moreover </S>",
    "<S> , new structures are observed in the low troposphere , with negative values associated with moist frontal regions . </S>",
    "<S> the negative values are observed in the frontal regions where slantwise convection instabilities may take place , but they are smaller than those observed with the equivalent potential vorticity . </S>",
    "<S> the main purpose of the article is to diagnose the behaviour of the new potential vorticity from numerical output generated by the arpege nwp model , with the help of isobaric charts and vertical cross - sections . </S>",
    "<S> two inversion methods are suggested . </S>",
    "<S> the first method could be based on the invertibility principle verified by the virtual potential vorticity , with a possibility to control and modify separately potential vorticity components in the ( dry ) upper and ( moist ) lower atmospheric levels . </S>",
    "<S> the other method may consist of an inversion process directly applied to the new moist - air entropy potential vorticity , because the negative values and the solenoidal term are smaller than those observed with equivalent potential vorticity , as shown by numerical evaluations .    _ copy of a paper submitted in august 2012 to the quarterly journal of the royal meteorological society ( accepted 16 april 2013 ) . with coloured figures . </S>"
