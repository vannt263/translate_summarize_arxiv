    "<S> two simple agent based models are often employed in epidemic studies : the susceptible - infected ( si ) and the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) . both models describe the time evolution of infectious diseases in networks in which vertices are either susceptible ( s ) or infected ( i ) agents . predicting the effects of disease spreading is one of the major goals in epidemic studies , but often restricted to numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> analytical methods using operatorial content are subjected to the asymmetric eigenvalue problem , restraining the usability of standard perturbative techniques , whereas numerical methods are limited to small populations since the vector space increases exponentially with population size @xmath0 . here , we propose the use of the squared norm of probability vector , @xmath1 , to obtain an algebraic equation which allows the evaluation of stationary states , in time independent markov processes . </S>",
    "<S> the equation requires eigenvalues of symmetrized time generators , which take full advantage of system symmetries , reducing the problem to an @xmath2 sparse matrix diagonalization . </S>",
    "<S> standard perturbative methods are introduced , creating precise tools to evaluate the effects of health policies .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the main goals in epidemics studies of communicable diseases is to correctly predict the time evolution of a given disease within a population @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the forecasting procedure , which may take numerical or analytic formulations , often encounters obstacles due to heterogeneous populations and the disease spreading dynamics . for instance , ambiguous symptoms among distinct diseases may under or overestimate total reported infections , leading to incorrect estimates of transmission rates . </S>",
    "<S> several epidemic models have been tailored to better grasp general behaviors in disease spreading @xcite . among them , </S>",
    "<S> the simplest one is the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model . </S>",
    "<S> the sis model is a markov process and describes the time evolution of a single infectious disease in a population formed by susceptible ( s ) and infected agents ( i ) . </S>",
    "<S> the infected agents carry the disease pathogens and may transmit them to susceptible agents with constant transmission rate @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the model also contemplates cure events for infected agents with constant cure rate @xmath4 and so does competition between cure and infection events .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two popular approaches often employed to mimic the disease spreading dynamic in populations with fixed size @xmath0 : compartmental and stochastic ones @xcite . in the compartmental approach , </S>",
    "<S> relevant properties derived from either infected or susceptible agents are well - described by averages , a direct result from the random - mixing hypothesis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this enables one to derive non - linear differential equations to match the evolution of disease throughout the population . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the number of infected agents in the compartmental sis model , @xmath5 , satisfies the following differential equation : @xmath6 with @xmath7 and basic reproduction number @xcite @xmath8 . for homogeneous populations , </S>",
    "<S> this is the expected behavior . </S>",
    "<S> however , real agents differ from each other , leading to heterogeneous population , in disagreement with the random - mixing hypothesis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> stochastic approaches may also be further classified according to their descriptive variable . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the compartmental model , the mesoscopic interpretation usually describes the time evolution of global variables @xcite , however , it allows fluctuations along time . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the microscopic approach describes the disease spreading of individual agents and their interactions , thus introducing fluctuations at the agent level over time . </S>",
    "<S> both approaches mostly differ on how they treat fluctuations due to agent heterogeneity within a given population , in the epidemic processes .    </S>",
    "<S> central to the microscopic stochastic approach is the underlying network used to reproduce the heterogeneity typically found within populations @xcite . in the network scheme , </S>",
    "<S> agents are represented by vertices and their connections are distributed according to the adjacency matrix @xmath9 for the assigned network configuration ( graph ) @xcite . in this case , it is well - accepted that the mean number @xmath10 of vertex connection in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqcompartimental1 ] ) describes the averaged process . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the random mixing hypothesis , non - trivial topological aspects of @xmath9 may be incorporated in the effective transmission and cure rates , producing complex patterns in epidemics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution is dictated by the transition matrix @xmath11 , whose matrix elements @xmath12 are transition probabilities from network configuration @xmath13 to @xmath14 @xcite . in general , </S>",
    "<S> one often assumes markovian behavior to describe disease transmission and cure events , in accordance with the poissonian assumption @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the compartmental and stochastic schemes leads to distinct evolution patterns for statistics as well . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , eq .  ( [ eqcompartimental1 ] ) displays stable infected population for @xmath15 , power - law behavior for @xmath16 and exponential decay otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> while all three behaviors are also observed in the stochastic approaches , fluctuations become much more relevant when the number of infected agents , @xmath17 , is small compared to total population , @xmath0 . incidentally , this is the relevant regime to sanitary measures and health policies to contain real epidemics in early stages .    </S>",
    "<S> the markovian approach produces accurate results if the infection transmission is known . however , its usability is restricted to numerical simulations with small @xmath0 since computational time is @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> this weakness lies in the fact the @xmath19 is generally non - hermitian @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , left and right eigenvectors are not related by transpositions , limiting the exact diagonalization only to small values of @xmath0 or special transition matrices . </S>",
    "<S> one of the main goals in epidemic studies is the ability to correctly predict how small parameter or topological changes in the network affect the disease spreading . </S>",
    "<S> if such predictions are robust , preemptive actions to lessen the epidemic are also expected to achieve better results . </S>",
    "<S> this is exactly the subject of perturbation techniques , which make extensive use of scalar product between left and right eigenvectors . in epidemic models , </S>",
    "<S> however , one must deal with asymmetric transitions , prohibiting perturbative schemes based on normed scalar products .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we have devised a method to avoid difficulties related to the non - hermiticity of @xmath11 using the squared norm of probability vector , @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed method allows us to obtain one differential equation , which relies only on eigenvalues of symmetrized time generators . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the equation resumes to an algebraic equation for stationary states . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the proposed method allows for seamless reproduction of traditional perturbative results , shedding light on the role played by fluctuation in epidemics . in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : conf ] , we introduce the mathematical aspects regarding the agent based sis model , with emphasis on the transition matrix and operatorial content . in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : time_evol ] , we discuss calculation of statistics and the temporal equation for @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> results obtained using perturbative methods for epidemics in agent based networks for sis model are shown in sec . </S>",
