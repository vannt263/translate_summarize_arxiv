    "a fair estimate of `` galaxy metallicity '' has been widely recognized as a basic issue when assessing the distinctive evolutionary properties of late - type galaxies ( ltgs ) , including all disk - dominated systems along the hubble morphological sequence . however , since both spiral and irregular galaxies consist of a composite stellar population , the question can not easily be settled , as it depends on the specific criterion we want to adopt to identify a value of @xmath15 ( or equivalently of [ fe / h ] ) ideally representative of the stellar system as a whole .",
    "for example , the youngest stars closely track the chemical composition of gas clouds within a galaxy , and we could therefore refer to their value of @xmath15 as the galaxy _ actual _ metallicity ( @xmath16 ) . on the other hand , this value may not account for the composition of earlier generations of stars , that however still provide a sizable contribution to galaxy total luminosity . in this regard , one would better like to consider an _ effective _ metallicity estimate ( @xmath17 ) , by weighting the composing stellar populations with their actual photometric contribution or with the number of star members in each group .",
    "these arguments yet emerge _",
    "`` in nuce '' _ from the seminal analysis of @xcite , but only @xcite extensively dealt with the problem of a fair estimate of the effective metallicity in their ltg models using bolometric luminosity as a weighting factor to account for the relative contribution of the composing stellar populations . with this criterion , by considering a collection of theoretical simple stellar populations ( ssps ) with a spread in the values of z , @xcite showed that the integrated spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for the aggregate still resembled the spectrum of just one ssp with @xmath18 . from her side ,",
    "@xcite further refined these arguments , at least in the early - type galaxy framework , emphasizing the difference between average methods such as to lead to @xmath19 $ ] vs.  @xmath20>$ ] . a direct estimate of both @xmath16 and @xmath21 is provided by ( * ?",
    "* hereafter aj91 ) in their ltg models .",
    "as expected , the effective metallicity is found to be systematically lower by a 20 - 30% with respect to the actual one .",
    "apart from any operational definition , however , one has to remark that the classical approach to galaxy chemical evolution , usually pursued in the literature , mainly proceeds from a dynamical point of view , where chemical composition is tightly related to the kinematical properties of the different stellar populations sharing the galaxy morphological design . @xcite and @xcite are striking examples , in this regard , of the empirical and theoretical focus to the problem , respectively .",
    "after all , just on these basis @xcite led to his first definition of pop i and ii stars .",
    "however , an even more direct physical argument ties metal abundance to galaxy luminosity evolution . for any gram of metals eventually produced in a galaxy , in fact , one gram of hydrogen has been burnt at some time releasing a fixed amount of energy . as a consequence,_a",
    "straightforward relationship must be in place between the actual amount of enriched mass in a galaxy ( m@xmath22 ) , in the form of metals plus helium in excess to the primordial abundance , and the past luminosity evolution .",
    "_ the importance of this constraint , often overlooked even in the recent literature , has been first raised by @xcite in the context of early - type galaxy evolution , and more explicitely assessed by @xcite .",
    "this argument also found a more definite theoretical settlement through the so - called `` fuel consumption theorem '' , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "given the range of interesting implications for the study of galaxy evolution , we want here to further investigate the problem of the energetic constraint to chemo - photometric evolution of galaxies , with special attention to the more composite scenario of late - type systems .",
    "our analysis will rely on the template galaxy models developed in @xcite .",
    "to better catch the real intention of this paper , we would like to warn the reader that our discussion will proceed as far as possible on analytical bases .",
    "this will forcedly require some educated simplifications to the problem ( after careful physical assessing however of the neglected complications ) , with the aim of more neatly let to emerge the leading relationships that govern galaxy evolution , and in particular the way these systems ( and the universe as a whole ) constrained their chemical composition at the different cosmic epochs .",
    "in order to better single out the relevant physical boundaries involved in our problem , we need to consider basically the two main photometric contributions , that constrain overall galaxy luminosity evolution . from one hand , in fact , we can recognize the `` smooth '' photometric contribution by stars along their quiescent ( namely `` hydrostatic '' ) evolutionary stages , according to a given imf . on the other hand",
    ", one has also to consider the supernova bursting events , that interleave galaxy evolution with short but extremely relevant episodes of mass processing .",
    "following @xcite , h - burning cycles release 26.731 mev per @xmath23he particle , while a supplementary amount of 7.274 mev per @xmath24c nucleus is produced by the 3@xmath25 he - burning cycle .",
    "overall , the energy budget of the nuclear processes that lead to carbon synthesis in stars reaches a total of @xmath26 this specific energy output accounts for the `` quiescent '' luminosity emission of a galaxy provided by the non - explosive evolutionary stages of stars along the entire imf mass range .",
    "a supplementary important source of energy and ism metal enrichment should however comprise also the sn explosive events .",
    "a quite different elemental pattern characterizes the ism chemical enrichment in case of sneia , meant to be the main synthesizers of the fe - ni elemental group @xcite , and sneii , which stem on the contrary from the core collapse of high - mass stars and mainly supply oxygen and other heavier @xmath25 elements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , both these events may actually be treated coherently in terms of specific energy release as they take in charge the post - carbon nuclear burning up to iron synthesis ( and beyond ) .",
    "again , following @xcite , whatever the chemical path of nuclear reactions , the atomic binding energy difference implies to release 60.605  mev per @xmath27fe nucleus or , equivalently , @xmath28    compared to `` quiescent '' nuclear reaction chains , for fixed amount of released energy , explosive nucleosynthesis is therefore roughly a factor of seven more efficient in the whole @xmath15 enrichment of the universe , selectively involving , however , only the heaviest metal supply ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * for a brief but timely focus on this subject ) .",
    "let us explore first the general case of a system consisting of a composite stellar population ( csp ) , as a result of a roughly continual feeding of fresh stellar generations along the whole photometric history .",
    "the nature itself of the problem suggests to consider the total bolometric luminosity of the csp as a convolution integral of several simple stellar populations ( ssps ) continually distributed in time according to a given star formation rate ( sfr ) , namely @xmath29    in @xcite we have shown that ssp bolometric luminosity ( @xmath30 ) smoothly evolves with time according to a simple power law such as @xmath31 ; for a salpeter imf , the power index @xmath32 , is virtually independent from the ssp chemical composition .",
    ", with the power index @xmath33 along the accounted stellar mass range from 0.1 to 120  m@xmath34 .",
    "see @xcite for further details.[foot1 ] ] our template galaxy models considered a disk sfr with a characteristic birthrate , @xmath35 ( see , for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , depending on the morphological type @xcite .",
    "the distinctive gas  @xmath10  star conversion efficiency implies for the star formartion rate a power - law time dependence such as @xmath36 , so that @xmath37 ( see * ? ? ? * for a full discussion ) .    within this framework ,",
    "the total luminosity of a csp at time @xmath38 becomes therefore @xmath39 with a normalization constant @xmath40 depending on the total mass of the aggregate . providing that both @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the integral equation has the euler beta function as a straightforward analytical solution .",
    "more explicitely , it can also be written as @xmath43 being @xmath44 the gamma function and @xmath45 .",
    "compared to a reference epoch @xmath46 , one can simply write @xmath47    if we integrate the csp emitting power @xmath48 over the entire galaxy life , until time @xmath49 , this eventually gets the global energy @xmath50 released by the nuclear processes to sustain galaxy luminosity until that age .",
    "@xmath51 where , @xmath52/(2-\\gamma)$ ] .",
    "clearly , at any time the latter quantity _ must _ balance the amount of processed mass m@xmath22 .",
    "with respect to the total csp stellar mass ( that is the total mass ever converted in stars , @xmath53 ) , we have that @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the energy - mass conversion factor set by the nuclear burning , according to our previous arguments .",
    "directly relates to the total efficiency @xmath56 of nuclear reactions .",
    "according to the einstein equation , i.e.   @xmath57 , we have that @xmath58 .",
    "this eventually leads to a mass @xmath10 energy conversion efficiency of @xmath59.[foot2 ] ] again , we set @xmath60 for notation convenience .",
    "interestingly enough , eq .  ( [ eq : stars ] ) shows that the way metals enhance with time in a csp does _ not _ depend on the sfr details , being fully modulated on the contrary by the imf slope , which eventually constrains the csp luminosity evolution through the power index @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , in the same equation , note that a parameter @xmath61 can also be regarded as a `` burning efficiency factor '' , which is a measure of how deeply processed mass has been exploited to produce luminosity .",
    "reference stellar mass ( @xmath62 ) and the corresponding csp luminosity ( @xmath63 ) are , of course , strictly related depending on the sfr details . relying on the @xcite theoretical framework",
    ", we computed in table  [ t1 ] the expected value of the @xmath64 ratio at 15  gyr for different csps ( col .  3 in the table ) along a range of values of the sfr power index , @xmath65 ( col .  1 ) and stellar birthrate @xmath7 ( col .  2 ) .",
    "these values are representative of the full range of scenarios that characterize disk evolution for the different ltg models . from the values of @xmath64 one",
    "can easily derive the expected csp bolometric luminosity , @xmath63 , as well as the value of @xmath66 at the reference age ( col .  4 and 5 , respectively , of table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "finally , the burning efficiency factor , @xmath67 is also computed in column 6 .    as",
    "both the total stellar mass and luminosity respond in the same way to the sfr , one has that @xmath68 that is _ time evolution of galaxy m / l ratio is a nearly universal law , that only depends on the observing wavelength _ and , for bolometric and a salpeter imf , scales aproximately as @xmath69 .",
    "the sfr enters , on the contrary , by setting the absolute value of @xmath64 , at a given age ; for example , when compared to a simple star burst , a smooth star formation will result , on average , in a larger number of young bright stars of high mass at a given age .",
    "this means , in general , that @xmath64 decreases with decreasing @xmath65 . in this regard , a convenient fit to the data of table  [ t1 ] provides : @xmath70 with an rms of @xmath71 on the predicted ratio .",

    ", a much more composite family of objects ( shortly grouped into type ia sne ) has to be reconducted to binary - star evolution . in this case ,",
    "the key mechanism deals with the mass transfer between the system members , where a primary ( originally more massive ) star , in its way to the final white - dwarf ( wd ) death , acts as a fresh - matter supplier to boost evolution of the secondary member .",

    "although morphological classification is the most immediate tool for a `` quick - look '' characterization of galaxy properties , it has been long questioned whether morphology univocally seats on intrinsic physical properties of the galaxy system as a whole .",

    "all these different pieces of evidence led eventually to identify galaxy ( stellar ) mass as ( one of ) the leading parameters that may intimately mark the life and fate of the spiral systems as a whole @xcite .    in this framework , the recent ultraviolet study by @xcite may add further interesting arguments to this composite scenario .",
    "these authors collected galex observations of three spiral - rich aggregates , from the lyon groups of galaxies ( lgg ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "( [ eq : tre ] ) shows that the `` extended '' roberts time , @xmath336 , is eventually driven by the `` down - sizing '' mechanism , which constrains the @xmath7 vs.  mass relationship . _",
    "the conclusion is that only a marked reduction of the present brithrate might allow spirals to sustain star formation far beyond one hubble time .",
    "_ in any case , only a negligible `` bonus '' is awarded to low - mass systems (",

    "in this paper we tried an alternative approach to the study of chemo - photometric properties of late - type galaxies .",
    "following previous theoretical efforts in this sense ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this required , in other words , to explicitely account for the chemical yields supplied by stars along the different range of mass .",
    "clearly , this `` analytical '' approach is the unescapable way when we want to trace the specific enrichment history of single chemical elements . on the other hand , as far as the global metallicity of a stellar aggregate is concerned , the analytical process risks to carry along and magnify the combined uncertainty from stellar evolution theory making the emerging picture to strongly depend on the model assumptions , often through a plethora of free tunable parameters .    on the contrary , in any `` synthetic '' approach",
    ", galaxy chemical evolution derives from other primary physical constraints .",
    "the works of @xcite and @xcite are two outstanding examples in this sense , assessing the chemical history of a stellar system as an _ implied consequence _ of its star - formation law . as a further variant on this line",
    ", our reasoning takes the move from the fact that a fixed amount of energy must always be released when matter is chemically enhanced through nuclear processing inside stars .",
    "theoretical nucleosynthesis predicts , in fact , that @xmath343  ergs are produced ( see sec .",
    "2 ) for each gram of hydrogen to be converted to heavier elements through non - explosive burning processes .",
    "a further amount of @xmath344  ergs per gram should then be added if we want to account for the explosive nucleosynthesis dealing with the sn events .",
    "overall , it is clear that a tight relationship has therefore to be expected between chemical enhancement of a galaxy and its past photometric history .",
    "the theoretical fundamentals which provide the reference framework for our analysis have been discussed in sec .  2 .",
    "in particular , we rely on the @xcite original code for stellar population synthesis , further elaborated to build up three - zone galaxy templates along the hubble morphological squence @xcite . for its special relevance within the global properties of late - type systems",
    ", our study is mainly focussed on the disk evolution , which broadly marks the macroscopic look of spiral and irregular galaxies .",
    "the standard scenario of the present calculations considers a salpeter imf , with stars formed within a mass range between 0.1 and 120  m@xmath34 .",
    "in addition , metals and helium proceed from processed stellar mass assuming a fixed enrichment ratio @xmath345 , as discussed in sec .",
    "following @xcite , an important assumption of our models is that stellar birthrate is a distinctive property of galaxy morphology and mass ( the latter , in force of the observed @xmath49-@xmath292 relationship , as shown in fig .",

    "consistently with the down - sizing scenario for galaxy formation @xcite , @xmath7 is therefore seen to decrease , in our models , with increasing @xmath292 @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "sfr scales with time according to a power law , and it is not directly coupled to the mean gas density of the disk as imposed , on the contrary , by other classical schemes @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : stars ] ) of sec .  2.1",

    "this means , in other words that , within just small ( @xmath347 ) individual differences , galaxies performed very similarly everywhere in the universe as efficient engines for energetic exploitation of the barionic matter through nuclear synthesis .",
    "accordingly , at any epoch we can univocally define a reference figure , that we called `` yield metallicity '' ( @xmath0 , see eq .",
    "[ eq : yield ] in sec .",
    "2.3 ) , which traces the mean composition of the stellar mass .",
    "the role of sne in the more general context of disk chemical evolution has been assessed in some detail in sec .",
    "a comparison of the energetic budget involved in quiescent and explosive nucleosynthesis indicates that sne are extremely powerful mass processors ; for fixed amount of released energy , in fact , they burn a factor of seven more mass than `` normal '' stars . following yet classical arguments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we know that the component of high - mass stars ( @xmath348 ) enables a very quick chemical enrichment during early evolution of galaxies .",
    "this `` prompt '' chemical enhancement is the result of the explosion of both core - collapsed objects , in the form of type ii sne , and accreted wds as a result of binary interactions , like in type ia sne .",
    "yield metallicity is therefore abruptly raised to @xmath349 on a timescale of a few @xmath83  yrs , a figure that further increases by @xmath350  dex within the first gyr of galaxy life ( see fig .  [ snrall ] ) .",
    "as , by definition , the cumulative action of `` prompt '' sneii and ia must be proportional to the galaxy stellar mass @xmath292 , the net effect of their contribution is to set a _ steady offset _",
    "( that we quantified in sec .",
    "3.2 in @xmath137 \\simeq -1.10 $ ]  dex ) to galaxy yield metallicity .    in this framework , for a salpeter imf",
    ", the implied yield metallicity evolves as @xmath1 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : calz ] ) . for the previous arguments ,",
    "this can be seen as a nearly universal law , only marginally dependent on the galaxy birthrate ( see , for instance , fig .",
    "[ zevol ] ) .",
    "an immediate consequence of this important property is that imf , rather than sfr , is the key player to set metallicity at primeval epochs , when @xmath351 and sne were governing chemical evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , non - salpeter stellar populations , strongly biased toward high - mass stars as in a flatter imf , have to be invoked to fit with the peculiar presence of bright super - solar galaxies at high redshift , as sometimes observed ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and also envisaged by some updated theoretical schemes ( see , for instance , the interesting explorations of @xcite , and @xcite ) . figure  [ f1 ] is an illustrative example of this mechanism when tracing the contribution of sneii to metal enhancement with varying the imf power - law index .",
    "a major advantage of taking yield metallicity as a reference marker in our analysis is that @xmath0 can easily be related to other key physical processes that constrain galaxy chemical evolution in its different facets .",
    "the ism metal enrichment is an evident example in this sense .",
    "chemical composition of the gaseous phase inside a galaxy is the resulting balance of two basic mechanisms . from one hand",
    ", one should carefully consider the bulk of processed mass returned by stars to the ism through sn events and quiescent stellar wind .",
    "on the other hand , this input has to be properly assessed in the physical context of dynamical evolution of the disk , such as to trace the way processed mass is eventually `` diluted '' within the fresh primordial gas .    in tackling the problem ( sec .",

    "to a closer analysis , however , it has to be recognized a clear tendency of models to predict a sharper chemical evolution of galaxy disk , such as to exceed , in most cases , the observed stellar metallicity at the present epoch .",
    "evidently , the shallower enrichment rate indicated by the observations points to a still unsettled problem with the primeval steps of disk evolution , and more specifically with the pre - enrichment processes related to the well known g - dwarf problem .",

    "it has to remain clear , however , that mass _ not _ morphology is the primary parameter that govern late - type galaxy properties @xcite .",
    "once accounting for galaxy chemical properties , by taking for instance oxygen abundance of hii regions as a tracer , the blurring trend with morphology leaves space to a much cleaner relationship with galaxy stellar mass , as in the upper panel of fig .",
    "facing the fact that low - mass systems also appear richer in gas and poorer in metals , one might even speculate on a simple scenario where the observed trend is in fact merely the result of the softening mechanism , that leads enriched stellar mass to mix into fresh unprocessed gas in the ism . actually , when galaxy data are properly rescaled to a fixed reference value of @xmath199 , through eq .",
    "( [ eq : ggg ] ) , one sees ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ sav ] ) that most of the @xmath9 $ ] vs.  @xmath292 trend is recovered , leaving a nearly flat @xmath9 $ ] distribution along the entire galaxy mass range .",
    "this result is consistent with our theoretical predictions for a nearly constant yield metallicity along the entire late - type galaxy sequence .    a striking evidence , when sampling the local universe , is that spiral galaxies appear all dangerously close to shut down their venture as stars - forming systems , being on the verge of exhausting their own gas resources . a so special case , and our somewhat suspicious temporal location as privileged observers , did not escape the analysis of many authors in the literature , leading @xcite first to wonder about the real `` residual life '' left to spiral systems according to their current gas capabilities . relying on our notation ,",
    "the so - called roberts time ( @xmath334 ) easily derives in its original definition , namely as the timescale for the primordial gas to vanish ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : rob ] ) . on the other hand , and",
    "more interestingly , one would like to assess the even more general case , when the global gas consumption ( i.e.  including returned stellar mass ) eventually sets ( or overcome ) the ultimate limit to galaxy star formation @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : tre ] ) shows that , as far a the down - sizing prescriptions set the reference relationship between birthrate and galaxy mass , one has to conclude that spiral galaxies can not escape an age where no stars will form at all .",
    "in fact , if returned mass is left as the only gas supplier to the ism , then the maximum birthrate that a galaxy can sustain is of the order of @xmath356 , which must evidently be much less than @xmath357 , for a salpeter imf . as a result , only massive ( @xmath12 ) sa / sb spirals may have some chance to extend their active life for a while ( namely for @xmath358 , as indicated by fig .",
    "[ trob ] ) . on the contrary",
    ", no way out seems to be envisaged for dwarf systems , that will soon cease their star formation activity unless to drastically reduce their apparent birthrate below the @xmath14 figure .",
    "i d like to thank luis carrasco and peppo gavazzi for so many inspiring discussions along all these years , when gazing together at stars and galaxies atop the mexican mountains .",
    "thanks are also due to robert kennicutt , for his wise comments to the draft of this paper , and to giovanni carraro and ivo saviane , for their warm hospitality during my visit at the eso premises in santiago de chile , where part of this work has been conceived .",
    "finally , the anonymous referee is especially acknowledged for a number of very constructive suggestions , which greatly helped better focus the key issues of the paper .",
    "this work has made extensive use of different on - line extragalactic databases , namely the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , operated by jpl / cit under contract with nasa , the hyper - linked extragalactic databases and archives ( hyperleda ) based at the lyon university , and the vizier catalog service of the centre de donnes astronomiques de strasbourg .",
    "part of the data retrieval has been eased by the dexter graphic interface , hosted at the german astrophysical virtual observatory ( gavo ) in heidelberg .",
