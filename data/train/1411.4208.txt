    "outflows driven by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are expected to sweep away most of the gas in their host galaxy , hence quenching both star formation and further black hole accretion , yielding to the black hole - galaxy mass relation observed locally ( e.g. , granato et al .",

    "@xcite , menci et al .",
    "quasar feedback is also thought to be the main mechanism preventing massive galaxies to over - grow ( explaining the dearth of very massive galaxies ) and responsible for the red colors of ellipticals . on the other hand ,",
    "some models are also requiring ` positive ' agn feedback , inducing star formation in the host galaxy through enhancing the gas turbulence in the interstellar medium , to reproduce the observed correlation between nuclear star forming activity and agn luminosity , the @xmath2 scaling relation and the enhanced specific star formation rate ( @xmath3 ) at high redshift ( e.g. silk @xcite , king @xcite , ishibashi & fabian @xcite ) .",
    "however , finding observational evidence of the effects of such quasar ` negative ' and ` positive ' feedback is still one of the main challenges of extragalactic astronomy .    according to agn - galaxy co - evolutionary models , the most luminous sources ( l@xmath4 erg s@xmath5 ) experience the so - called ` feedback ' or ` blow - out ' phase after an early dust enshrouded phase associated with rapid smbh growth and violent star formation episodes ( e.g. menci et al .",

    "the accreting bh releases the energy necessary to heat or expel the gas , in the form of outflowing winds , manifesting itself as an x - ray and visible quasar .    while powerful outflows sustained by kinetic energy ejected in the hosts of luminous radio - galaxies by relativistic and collimated jets have been commonly detected out to z@xmath6 ( see e.g. nesvadba et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , radiatively - driven winds are less commonly observed , and only very recently spatially resolved optical , ir and mm spectroscopic studies convincingly showed the first evidences for the existence of such processes at low - z ( e.g. feruglio et al .",

    "however at high - z , where the effects of feedback are expected to be more effective , most of the results are still based on the observations of very luminous , unobscured qsos , in which the blow - out phase is expected to be near its end . instead , if large scale , energetic radiatively driven winds are rare because they arise during a short - lived stage ( @xmath7 myr ) , the crucial point is to select objects at the maximum of the ` feedback ' phase , when the obscuration is still significant .",
    "we have recently completed two follow - up programs on obscured quasars pre - selected for being in a significant outflowing phase .",
    "the first consists in x - shooter observations of a sample of x - ray selected obscured qsos at z@xmath8 , selected from the xmm - cosmos survey ( hasinger et al .",
    "@xcite ) on the basis of their observed red colors ( r - k@xmath9 ) and high mir and x - ray to optical flux ratios ( x / o@xmath10 , see brusa et al .",
    "the presence of outflowing material identified by  kinematics was indeed detected in 6 out of 8 sources , confirming the efficiency of a selection based on x - ray to optical to nir colors in isolating such objects undergoing a ` blow - out ' phase ( brusa et al .",
    "@xcite ) . moreover , in the two brightest targets ( xid2028 and xid5321 ) we were able to perform slit - resolved spectroscopy and detect an extended wing of  on scales of @xmath116 - 10 kpc from the central agn , suggesting the presence of a massive , galactic - scale outflow ( see perna et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we also recently completed a sinfoni program on a sample of agn pre - selected to have high accretion rates , where radiatively - driven winds are supposed to be more effective since they likely originate from the acceleration of disk outflows by the agn radiation field , and a combination of moderate obscuration observed in the x - rays and high eddington ratio where outflows or transient absorption are expected to happen ( fabian et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    interestingly , xid2028 at @xmath0 was selected as an obscured , outflowing qsos using both criteria described above .",
    "moreover , it presents additional , indirect evidences of being an object caught in the feedback phase .",
    "it shows a point like nucleus embedded in an extended galaxy with asymmetric / disturbed morphology as witnessed by rest - frame u - band hst / acs ( advanced camera for survey ) data , and as expected in mergers models .",

    "the total bolometric agn luminosity of xid2028 , as determined from the sed decomposition , is l@xmath12 ( lusso et al .",

    "@xcite ) . assuming virial arguments , this translates into a black hole mass @xmath14 .",
    "such massive bh is hosted in a massive galaxy ( @xmath15 from sed decomposition fitting ) ongoing substantial star formation ( @xmath16 from pacs / herschel data , see brusa et al .",

    "the radio flux is @xmath18 and the radio power implied by the faint detection ( @xmath19 ) places this source in the radio quiet class .",
    "in fact , we derive a value for q@xmath20 , computed between the observed 24 micron and 1.4 ghz flux densities .",
    "this value places the source well outside the radio loud class ( bonzini et al .",

    "the galaxy xid2028 was observed with the near - ir integral field spectrograph sinfoni ( eisenhauer et al .",
    "@xcite ) in j band at the vlt ut4 telescope in the framework of program 092.a-0144 ( pi mainieri ) .",
    "the observations were executed in four different nights during february and march 2014 .",
    "the j band grating was used to sample the redshifted [ oiii]@xmath21@xmath215007,4959 and h@xmath22 emissions , providing a spectral resolution of @xmath23 .",
    "the observations were carried out in seeing limited mode , using the @xmath24 pixel scale , which provides a total field of view of @xmath25 .",
    "the average spatial resolution obtained , as sampled by combined point spread function ( psf ) reference star observations before and after every hour of target integration , is @xmath26 . during each observing block ( ob ) , an abba nodding was used , putting the target in two positions of the field of view about @xmath27 apart , with an integration time of 600 sec in each position .",
    "the total integration time was 6 hours on target .",
    "sinfoni h+k observations of the source taken in may 2009 were available in the eso archive ( program 383.a-0573 , pi mcmahon ) .",
    "the h+k grating samples the h@xmath1 and [ nii]@xmath21@xmath216548,6584 with @xmath28 .",
    "the data were obtained in seeing limited mode with the @xmath24 pixel scale , in four integrations of @xmath29 each , following an abba pattern , for a total of 20 exposure .",
    "a dedicated psf star observation is not available , but the resolution obtained on the telluric star observed after the science exposure for flux calibration suggests a spatial resolution of @xmath30 .",
    "both the j band and h+k data were reduced using the eso pipeline ( modigliani et al .",
    "@xcite ) , with the improved sky subtraction proposed by davies et al . @xcite .",
    "after flat - fielding , sky subtraction , correction for distortions , cosmic rays removal and wavelength calibration , the two - dimensional ( 2d ) data of each ob are mapped into a 3d data cube with dimensions @xmath31 pixels .",
    "telluric o / b type stars observations are used to flux calibrate each ob .",
    "the flux calibrated cubes of the different obs are then combined together by measuring the relative offsets from the detected centroid of emission in a given spectral channel .",
    "the final result of the data reduction procedure is a flux - calibrated datacube , containing the full image of the galaxy observed at each wavelength .",
    "we are thus able to extract from the cube both the one - dimensional spectrum at each pixel ( or integrated over a larger region ) and monochromatic images of the field of view at different wavelengths .",
    "finally , xid2028 lies in the cosmic evolution survey field ( cosmos@xcite ) , and therefore benefits from deep hst / acs coverage in the f814w filter ( 1 orbit , corresponding to @xmath32s ) , achieving a limiting point - source 5@xmath33 depth of ab=27.2 and a spatial scale of 0.05@xmath34/pixel ( koekemoer et al .",
    "@xcite ) . this filter samples the rest - frame u - band emission at z@xmath35 .    in the following",
    "we will analyze the sinfoni j and h+k datacubes , fitting the line profiles on pixel to pixel basis for the brightest lines to measure and map the line emission distributions and the corresponding velocities .",
    "given the highly asymmetric shape of the line profiles for  and , we have fitted separately the spectrum of each spatial spaxel in the field of view using a broken power law distribution convolved with a gaussian : @xmath36 the free parameters of the fit are , for each line , the central wavelength @xmath37 , the two power - law indices @xmath1 and @xmath22 , the gaussian width @xmath33 used for the convolution , and the normalization @xmath38 .",
    "this function allows to reproduce asymmetric velocity profiles , and it is often used to fit qso broad line regions ( e.g. nagao et al .",
    "we also add a broad gaussian component to reproduce the contribution of the blr to the h@xmath22 line.this choice reproduces well the complex line profile in our data , as shown in fig .",
    "[ jband ] for the @xmath39 nuclear region , and has the advantage of having a single component for the [ oiii ] lines , with respect to multiple gaussians , making it a more stable choice to fit the variation of the line profile across the field of view in the sinfoni datacube .    the  profile in the h+k data cube is instead dominated by the broad component due to the blr , considerably extincted in the  region , and that is well reproduced and fitted by a single , symmetric gaussian .",
    "lower s / n residuals are present , and they are discussed in sect .  [ hresults ] .",
    "the integrated j band spectrum of xid2028 is shown in fig .",
    "[ jband ] : an asymmetric , prominent blue wing is clearly visible for all the emission lines , already suggesting the presence of outflowing material towards the observer .",
    "in fact , the forbidden [ oiii ] emission lines are an ideal tracer of extended outflowing ionized gas , as can not be produced in the high - density , sub - parsec scales typical of agn broad - line regions ( blr ) .",
    "therefore , an asymmetric , broad [ oiii ] profile has been interpreted as evidence of outflowing gas , both in agn and in starburst dominated galaxies ( see e.g. harrison et al .",
    "@xcite , mullaney et al .",
    "as often reported in such systems , a corresponding redshifted component is missing in xid2028 , probably due to dust obscuration in the receding side of the outflow .        to assess the spatial extent of the blueshifted wing , in fig .",
    "[ jband ] we also show the continuum subtracted sinfoni datacube collapsed on the spectral channels corresponding to the line core and to the line wing in the left and right panel respectively ( lower panels ) .",
    "the prominence of an extended , fully resolved outflow is evident from the image of the blue wing in the west - east direction .",
    "the blue wing is originating on the qso position , as marked from the line core black contours , and it is extending up to @xmath40 , i.e. 13 projected kpc , from the center .",
    "we have fitted separately the spectrum of [ oiii ] in each spatial spaxel in the field of view using eq .",
    "[ pareto ] , in order to map the velocity of the line wing .",
    "given the complexity of the line profile , we adopted a non - parametric definition to characterise the widths and velocities within each spaxel of the sinfoni data ( see also harrison et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular",
    ", a map across the field of view of @xmath41 , the velocity at the 10th percentile of the overall emission - line profile in each pixel , is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ outvel ] , with the contours of the flux integrated over the blue wing ( see fig .",
    "[ jband ] , lower right panel ) , and shows strongly blueshifted velocities in the outflow region , with velocities as high as @xmath42 towards our line of sight .",
    "the detected velocity are far too high to be due to rotational motions in the host galaxy . moreover , in case of ordered rotation we expect the line width to be peaked at the center of the galaxy , where the velocity gradient is steeper and smeared out by the observational beam ( e.g. cresci et al .",
    "@xcite ) , while in this case the line width is larger in the blue wing region , supporting the interpretation that the high velocity is due to an outflow and not to kinematics in the host galaxy .",
    "we plot in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ outvel ] the velocity width @xmath43 , i.e. the width of the line that contains 40% of the emission line flux such that @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath41 are the velocities at the 50th and 10th percentiles , respectively .",
    "this is an esimate of the width of the blue wing of the line .",
    "the larger wing widths ( @xmath46 ) are observed in the same regions where the strongly blueshifted gas is detected , as expected in the case of outflowing material ( mller - sanchez et al .",
    "similarly , small bulk velocity ( @xmath47 ) , velocity dispersions and distinct kinematic components have been observed in the few cases were galactic inflows have been detected , mostly in absorption ( e.g. bouch et al .",
    "theoretical modelling also predicts that inflows should have small covering factor ( steidel et al .",
    "@xcite ) , explaining why direct observations of infalling gas have been so elusive and mostly indirect evidence of gas infall at high redshift are available ( e.g. cresci et al .",
    "finally , we rule out that the observed blueshifted velocities may be due to a merging galaxy , as the deep acs image of the source do not show any counterpart at the blue wing peak ( see fig .",
    "[ hintegrated ] ) , and this scenario would not explain the large line widths observed all over the blueshifted region .",
    "we derived the physical properties of the outflowing gas from the observed line emissions adopting a simple conical ( or bi - conical ) outflow distribution uniformly filled with outflowing clouds ( see also maiolino et al .",
    "we first estimate the outflowing ionized emitting gas from the  emission in the outflow region ( liu et al .",
    "@xcite , osterbrock & ferland @xcite ) , assuming @xmath48 , as : @xmath49 assuming @xmath50 , and using the  luminosity @xmath51 measured on the outflow region after removing the continuum and the broad component due to the blr ( see fig .",
    "[ jband ] ) , with no extinction correction , we get : @xmath52 we note that this is a lower limit given the unknown correction due to the dust extinction in the outflow , and that the uncertainty on the measure of @xmath53 is much small compared to all our assumptions .",
    "the maximum outflow velocity inferred from our kinematic analysis is @xmath54 .",
    "we assume in the following that this is representative of the average outflow velocity , i.e. the de - projected velocity of the outflow , and regard the lower velocities observed due to projection effects .",
    "this is again a lower limit if the ( bi-)conical outflow does not intercept the line of sight .",
    "given the radius derived for the outflow @xmath55 , the dynamical time is given by : @xmath56 which is consistent with similar outflows reported in the literature ( greene et al .",
    "@xcite ) , as well as with the expected typical agn lifetime ( martini et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    given our hypothesis of a ( bi-)conical outflow distribution out to a radius @xmath57 for the ionized wind , uniformly filled with outflowing clouds , the volume - averages density of the gas is : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the solid angle subtended by the ( bi-)conical outflow . the mass outflow rate is therefore given by : @xmath60 note that the outflow rate is actually independent of both the opening angle @xmath59 of the outflow and of the filling factor @xmath61 of the emitting clouds ( under the assumption of clouds with the same density ) . using the outflowing mass derived in eq .",
    "[ massout ] we obtain @xmath62 .",
    "this represents an estimate for the ionized component only : if the qso is also driving a neutral / molecular outflow , the total mass outflow rate is probably up to an order of magnitude larger ( e.g. scaling by the same neutral - to - ionized fraction as in local qsos , e.g. rupke et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in fact , evidences for the presence of a neutral outflow are derived from naid absorption lines in the x - shooter spectra ( see perna et al .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore derive that : @xmath63 although further observations at mm wavelengths sampling the molecular gas phase are required to assess the total mass and energy output , given the several assumptions and limits in this analysis .",
    "the corresponding kinetic power is given by : @xmath64 the momentum flux ( i.e. @xmath65 ) inferred for this large - scale outflow is @xmath66 , which corresponds to an outflow momentum rate relative to @xmath67 ( i.e. the `` momentum boost '' ) of @xmath11 10 .",
    "this corresponds to what is expected in case of an energy - conserving outflows , where the momentum boost is linked to the velocity of the fast wind originated from the immediate vicinity of the agn accretion disk that triggers the acceleration of the galactic - scale , massive outflow ( faucher - gigure et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in fact , assuming a nuclear wind velocity of 0.1@xmath68 ( as typically estimated for x - ray ultra - fast outflows by x - ray observations , e.g. king et al .",
    "@xcite , tombesi et al .",
    "@xcite ) , for a velocity of @xmath69 we would expect a momentum boost of @xmath1110 .",
    "such high velocities , mass outflow rate and kinetic power can not be sustained by star formation only .",
    "in fact , the derived limit on the ratio between the mass outflow rate and the sfr for xid2028 is @xmath70 , while it has been measured to be @xmath71 in star forming driven outflow ( e.g. cicone et al .",
    "@xcite ) . accordingly ,",
    "the kinetic output expected from supernovae and stellar winds ( veilleux et al .",
    "@xcite ) for the star formation in xid2028 , @xmath72 , is at least 2.5 times lower than the measured kinetic power .",
    "moreover , wind velocities above @xmath73 are extremely difficult to attain in starburst driven winds ( see thacker et al .",
    "@xcite , lagos et al .",
    "therefore the central qso seems to be the engine driving such a powerful outflow , as also suggested by the geometry of the outflowing gas , with the apparent starting point coincident with the agn position in the nucleus of the galaxy ( see fig .",
    "[ jband ] ) .",
    "the h+k sinfoni datacube is sampling the  line region , which in qsos spectra is usually consisting of a broad component due to the agn broad line region ( blr , @xmath74 ) , plus narrower components coming from the narrow line region ( nlr , @xmath75 ) and from the star formation in the host galaxy ( @xmath76 ) .",

    "the different line ratios between the nucleus and the star forming regions indicate that scattered light from the qso is not dominant at this wavelength . therefore , assuming that all the narrow  is due to star formation , the total integrated narrow emission in the combined regions a and b corresponds to a total star formation rate @xmath86 , using @xmath87 as obtained by the sed decomposition fitting in bongiorno et al .",

    "although at least part of the u emission may be due to scattered light from the qso ( zakamska et al .",

    "the star formation activity on the host is therefore heavily suppressed in the core of the outflow , where the fast expanding gas is able to sweep away the gas needed to sustain the assemble of new stars .",
    "this represents a clear example of _ ` negative feedback ' _ in action , showing the powerful outflow expelling most of the gas and quenching the star formation along its route in the host galaxy . on the other hand",

    "using an efficient criterion to select obscured agns at the maximum of their feedback activity based on the observed red colors ( r - k@xmath9 ) and high x - ray to optical flux ratio ( x / o@xmath10 ) , the @xmath92 qso was selected to be in the short lived blow - out phase .",
    "this galaxy is selected at the peak epoch of galaxy and black hole assembly , where we expect to have the maximum influence of feedback on the evolution of the host galaxies .",
    "therefore , the results presented are particularly relevant in the broad picture of galaxy evolution , and an important complement to the more numerous observations of outflows in local galaxies .",
    "thanks to the spatial information of j band sinfoni near - ir integral field spectroscopy , we were able to map a remarkably extended ( 13 kpc ) and fast ( @xmath93 ) outflow in this source , fitting the  blueshifted line wing .",
    "moreover , we studied the energetic of the outflow , finding a mass outflow rate @xmath94 for the ionized component only , which would translate into a total outflow rate of @xmath95 and a total kinetic power @xmath96 once allowing for a contribution by the molecular and neutral phase .",
    "although a more firm estimate of the outflowing mass will be obtained only with forthcoming mm observations ( pdbi and alma ) , we stress that such an energetic outflow is hardly sustainable by star formation only , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ energetic ] .",
    "finally , we were able to study the effects of such energetic outflow on the host galaxy , using both h+k band sinfoni observations sampling  and hst - acs in the f814w filter .",
    "both the narrow h@xmath1 emission line map and the rest frame u band acs imaging , tracing the star formation in the host galaxy , show that the outflow position lies in the center of a cavity in the star forming regions in the host galaxy .",
    "this is suggestive of a scenario in which the powerful outflow is removing the gas from the host galaxy ( ` negative feedback ' ) , but also triggering star formation with the gas clouds compressed by the outflow - driven shock , which drives turbulent compression especially at the outflow edges ( ` positive feedback ' ) .",
    "such ` positive feedback ' has been invoked in recent years to explain the correlation between agn luminosities and nuclear star formation rates ( imanishi et al .",
    "@xcite , zinn et al .",
    "@xcite , zubovas et al .",
    "@xcite ) as well as between black hole accretion rate and star formation rate in agn ( silverman et al .",
    "@xcite , mullaney et al .",
    "moreover , one additional motivation for introducing agn outflows ( jets or winds ) as a star formation trigger is that this mechanism introduces a time scale that is shorter than the gravitational time scale ( silk & norman @xcite ) . as agn feedback",
    "is expected to be dominant at high redshift and rare at low redshift , models that are taking into account ` positive ' feedback as a second mode of star formation claim to naturally account for the observed evolution of ssfr ( silk @xcite ) , elevated and more slowly varying at high redshift ( see e.g. stark et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and the higher efficiency in star formation ( ishibashi & fabian @xcite , @xcite ) observed in sub - mm and ulirg galaxies ( e.g. genzel et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    despite its possible importance in galaxy evolution , the few available observational evidences of such feedback in action",
    "were till now ascribed to an handful of extreme , powerful jets in radio - loud galaxies , in the local and high redshift universe .",
    "moreover , the feedback - induced star formation has been usually found not in the agn host galaxy , but in a companion satellite aligned along the radio axis .",
    "for example , croft et al .",
    "@xcite and elbaz et al .",
    "@xcite found jet induced star formation in companion galaxies of radio loud agns , while kramer et al .",
    "@xcite observations suggest that the radio jet from a @xmath97 qso is triggering molecular cloud formation @xmath98 away from the host galaxy . on the other hand , feain et al .",
    "@xcite found evidences of star formation aligned with the radio jet both in a qso host galaxy at @xmath99 as well as in a companion , and crockett et al .",
    "@xcite revealed young stars near the filament of centaurus a. finally , rodrguez - zaurn et al .",
    "@xcite detected in a local , merging and radio loud ulirg super star clusters moving at high velocities ( 450 km / s ) with respect to the local ambient gas , suggesting that they have been formed either in fast moving gas streams / tidal tails as part of the merger process or as a consequence of jet - induced star formation linked to the extended , diffuse radio emission in the halo of the galaxy .",
    "therefore , xid2028 may represent the first direct detection of outflow induced star formation in a radio quiet agn , as well as the first example of both types of feedback simultaneously at work in the same galaxy .",
    "the data presented demonstrate that both ` positive ' and ` negative ' agn feedback are crucial ingredients to shape the evolution of galaxies , by regulating the star formation in the host and driving the bh - galaxy coevolution .",
    "our results show that these mechanisms are in action not only in powerful radio galaxies with relativistic jets , but also in less extreme objects during an obscured qso phase that is thought to be a common step in the evolutionary sequence of star forming galaxies .",
