    "the analogy between fluid turbulence and financial markets has been previously noticed [ 1,2 ] . the energy flow in hydrodynamics",
    "is supposed to mimic the information transfer in financial markets , or the entropy variation of the market @xcite .",
    "some hierarchical structures are thought to exist , leading to cascades of information and clusters of buy - sell orders @xcite and sometimes to crashes @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , more work on  financial cascades  can be found on the foreign exchange market time series [ 7 - 14 ] rather than on share prices or stock market indices . however , since all such financial time series indicate nonstationarity , a multifractal @xcite description seems useful [ 13,14,17 - 24 ] .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present original results on the deutsche aktienindex ( dax ) , obtaining the roughness parameter ( @xmath3 ) and the degree of intermittency ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-th order moments of the structure functions and the singular measures are constructed thereof [ 23 - 25 ] .",
    "the behaviors are consistent with the multi - affine properties of other turbulent phenomena @xcite .",
    "understanding the processes that underlie these `` macroscopic '' effects remains at the speculative level .",
    "numerical differences are pointed out .",
    "nevertheless , the nonexhaustive list of references is a sufficient argument for asserting the analogy and suggesting further work .",
    "the deutsche aktienindex ( dax ) data used here is from @xmath5 .",
    "it goes from oct . 01 , 1959 till dec . 30 , 1998 .",
    "let the data consist in a series @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a discrete variable @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath9 data points .",
    "first , the scaling range ( if any ) is found from a detrended fluctuation analysis ( @xmath10 ) method [ 27 ] . it is found that the scaling range extends up to 256 days , after which the error bars become too large .",
    "the scaling ( hausdorff ) exponent @xmath11 is about the same as that of the djia @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the self - affine fractal dimension @xmath12 = @xmath13 .",
    "knowing the scaling range , one can reconsider the problem of the time variation of @xmath12 ( or @xmath14 ) . in the multifractal approach @xcite ,",
    "one seeks for various scales of self - affinity , through the so - called @xmath0-th order structure functions @xmath15 where only non - zero terms are considered in the average @xmath16 taken over all @xmath17 couples @xmath18 such that @xmath19 is a characteristic time lag , @xmath20 , with @xmath21 , see fig.1 . assuming a power law dependence of the structure function @xmath22",
    ", the @xmath1 spectrum is defined through @xmath23 and is shown in fig.2 , as @xmath24 ; note that @xmath25 [ 22 ] .",
    "intermittency _ of the signal can be studied through a singular measure analysis .",
    "define a measure @xmath26 as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the small - scale gradient field and @xmath29    next , define a series of ever more coarse - grained and ever shorter fields @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the average measure in the interval @xmath33 $ ] is @xmath34 the scaling properties are then searched for through @xmath35 for @xmath36 . thereby , the multifractal properties of the dax signal are expressed by two scaling functions , @xmath1 for describing the roughness of the signal and @xmath37 its intermittency . the @xmath37 spectrum ( fig.2 ) is closely related to the generalized dimensions @xmath38 [ 15,16 ] .",
    "a nonlinearity of both @xmath24 and @xmath37 implies multifractality .",
    "let @xmath39 .",
    "it seems to be a measure of the information entropy of the system @xcite . for the dax , @xmath40 ,",
    "interestingly compared to @xmath41 for the djia @xcite .",
    "note that both @xmath14 s = @xmath42 are similar .",
    "let @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the function @xmath45 is the fractal dimension of the cantor dust set of points having the same roughness exponent @xmath46 [ 16 ] .",
    "the @xmath47 function acts like the function @xmath48 in ref.[16 ] .",
    "the @xmath2 curve is shown in fig .",
    "the error bars are easily estimated from fig.1 and the above equations .",
    "note that @xmath2 reaches a maximal dimension for some finite @xmath49 corresponding to the fractal dimension of the signal if it was self - affine [ 22 ] .",
    "for a long time , the only available theoretical background to the statistical behavior of prices was the efficient market theory ( emt ) .",
    "the emt has been usually identified with the random walk character of prices ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) . in finance papers , @xmath52 values",
    "have been reported , -the deviations from @xmath53 being explained by regulations imposed on the market by central authorities .",
    "however , @xmath14 seems to be often different from @xmath53 , and @xmath4 is finite .",
    "thus , one should expect multifractal features indicating that the origin of scaling laws in financial time series is to be found in exogenous forces that cover a wide variety of influences .",
    "finally , let us conclude that fluctuations in dax and other financial market data time series @xcite can be compared to those occurring in turbulence .",
    "analogies with intermittency , cascades , period doubling @xcite can be invoked with kolmogorov @xmath54-law process @xcite and the fractional brownian motion as basic ideas .",
    "recall that intermittency as introduced in turbulence led to a multifractal description , with @xmath55 and @xmath56.the above data indicate that the dax ( and djia [ 9 ] ) @xmath57 and @xmath58 are far away from the turbulence domain @xmath59 and @xmath56 . thus there is some analogy , but",
