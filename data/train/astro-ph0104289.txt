    "in acceleration scenarios ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) with energies above @xmath7ev are assumed to be protons accelerated in powerful astrophysical sources . during their propagation ,",
    "for energies above @xmath8 eev ( @xmath9 ) they lose energy by pion production and pair production ( protons only ) on the microwave background . for sources further away than a few dozen mpc this would predict a break in the cosmic ray flux known as greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff  @xcite , around @xmath10eev .",
    "this break has not been observed by experiments such as fly s eye@xcite , haverah park@xcite , yakutsk@xcite , hires@xcite and agasa@xcite , which instead show an extension beyond the expected gzk cutoff and events above @xmath11eev .",
    "this situation has in recent years triggered many theoretical explanations ranging from conventional acceleration to new physics as well as the construction of large new detectors  @xcite .    in bottom - up scenarios of uhecr origin , in which protons are accelerated in powerful astrophysical objects such as hot spots of radio galaxies and active galactic nuclei  @xcite , one would expect to see the source in the direction of arrival of uhecrs .",
    "the lack of observed counterparts to the highest energy events  @xcite implies the existence of large scale intervening magnetic fields with intensity @xmath12 g  @xcite , which would provide sufficient angular deflection , or bursting sources and a magnetic field of intensity @xmath13 g which would impart sufficient time delay to uhe protons to explain their lack of correlation in time of arrival with optical or high energy photons  @xcite .",
    "it has been realized recently that magnetic fields as strong as @xmath14 g in sheets and filaments of large scale structure , such as our local supercluster , are compatible with existing upper limits on faraday rotation  @xcite .",
    "such strong magnetic fields would have profound consequences for the propagation of charged ultra - high energy cosmic rays  @xcite .",
    "in particular in the presence of a magnetic field of strength @xmath15 g , and for a source at distance @xmath6mpc , uhecrs with energy @xmath16eev would diffuse , while higher energy cosmic rays would propagate rectilinearly .",
    "the resulting modification of the energy spectrum would explain naturally the observed spectrum for a unique power - law injection of index @xmath17 . in ref.@xcite , we further showed that a large number of such sources in the local supercluster , at distance scale @xmath6mpc and an ambient magnetic field @xmath15 g would explain the large scale isotropy of arrival directions observed by agasa@xcite .",
    "it would also explain the observed small - scale angular clustering ( five doublets and one triplet within @xmath18 out of 57 events above @xmath19eev ) by magnetic lensing effects through the large scale turbulent magnetic field .    at first sight this suggests the possibility of having only one object in the sky as the source of all uhecrs with @xmath20eev , including the highest energy events .",
    "two versions of such single source scenarios have recently been put forward in the literature : one with an extreme version of a coherent galactic magnetic wind structure in which all observed uhecrs supposedly can be traced back to m87 in the virgo cluster  @xcite , and a second one with centaurus a at 3.4  mpc distance with an all - pervading magnetic field of intensity @xmath21 g  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we examine critically the latter of these scenarios using detailed numerical simulations for the energy spectrum and the angular distribution of uhecrs propagating in magnetic fields of r.m.s .",
    "strength between 0.3 and 1 @xmath22 g .",
    "trajectories are calculated from the lorentz equation in a given magnetic field and pion production is treated as stochastic energy loss while pair production is included into the equations of motion as a continuous energy loss term .",
    "this numerical tool has been used and discussed in earlier publications  @xcite .",
    "= 3.5 in = 3.5 in    we assume a homogeneous random turbulent magnetic field with power spectrum @xmath23 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 otherwise .",
    "we use @xmath26 , corresponding to kolmogorov turbulence , in which case @xmath27 , the largest eddy size , characterizes the coherence length of the magnetic field ; we use @xmath28mpc , which corresponds to a few turn - arounds in a hubble time . physically one expects @xmath29 , but numerical resolution limits us to @xmath30 .",
    "we generally use @xmath31mpc , but we checked by increasing the resolution for several runs that it has no effect on the results discussed in the following .",
    "the magnetic field modes are dialed on a grid in momentum space according to this spectrum with random phases and then fourier transformed onto the corresponding grid in location space .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "strength @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 .",
    "typically , 5000 trajectories are computed for each magnetic field realization obtained in this way for 10 - 20 realizations in total .",
    "each trajectory is followed for a maximal time of 10 gyr and as long as the distance from the observer is smaller than double the source distance .",
    "we have also checked that the results do not significantly depend on these cut - offs .",
    "furthermore , the distance limit is reasonable physically as it mimics a magnetic field concentrated in the large scale structure , with much smaller values in the voids , as generally expected .",
    "= 3.5 in    in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , we show the angular distribution of uhe events as seen on earth in equatorial coordinates , for two ranges of energies @xmath34eev , and @xmath35eev , and for @xmath36 g , with cen  a as the source . these images are averaged over different spatial realizations of the magnetic field",
    ". the distributions for specific realisations are more anisotropic than the average due to cosmic variance .",
    "the angular distribution predicted by this one source model is thus not consistent with the isotropic distribution deduced by experimental data  @xcite .",
    "this is even more clearly demonstrated by fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , which gives the distribution in declination of arrival coordinates of uhe events .",
    "the source cen  a is located at @xmath37 , @xmath38 in equatorial coordinates , and corresponds to the peak of flux in figs .  [ f1],[f2 ] .",
    "= 3.5 in    cen  a does not lie in the field of view of experiments that have provided data so far such as the fly s eye and agasa .",
    "this and the fact that the angular deflection of particles with @xmath35eev is relatively small has an important consequence for the energy spectrum predicted by this model : the northern hemisphere experiments should never have detected the highest energy events , for which the angular deflection is too weak to bring the particle in the field of view .",
    "this is made clear in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , where we compare the spectrum predicted for agasa with the actually observed spectrum , assuming an injection spectrum @xmath39 up to @xmath40ev .",
    "the prediction is obtained by folding the simulated distribution in energy @xmath41 and arrival direction @xmath42 , @xmath43 , with the normalized agasa exposure function @xmath44 ( which to a good approximation only depends on declination @xmath45 ) : @xmath46 for reference , we also show in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] the spectrum that would be observed by an idealized detector covering the whole sky uniformly , and by a mirror agasa experiment located in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the solid angle integrated spectrum @xmath47 observed by a uniform detector is still different from the injection spectrum ( @xmath39 ) at low energies , while the two match at high energies .",
    "this results from an increased local residence time due to diffusion at low energies , and rectilinear propagation ( hence unaffected energy spectrum ) at high energies  @xcite .",
    "the pile - up around @xmath48eev due to pion production of higher energy particles , also contributes to the change of slope at low energies .",
    "the scenario just discussed , which is already ruled out by the energy spectrum and large - scale isotropy recorded by northern hemisphere detectors , has been proposed by farrar & piran  @xcite on analytical grounds to explain all observational data .",
    "the discrepancy , as will be discussed in greater detail in section  3 , results from the fact that they argued that diffusion held up to the highest energies , whereas in fact the diffusion approximation breaks for @xmath35eev , implying much larger anisotropies at these energies .",
    "the impact of angular anisotropy on the energy spectrum for a source located in the blind area of northern hemisphere detectors had also been overlooked in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the scenario with @xmath49 g we have also established a rough estimate of the minimal number of sources necessary to explain existing observations in the following way : we overlayed distributions from single sources in random directions ( for simplicity chosen to be at equal distances as cen  a ) and computed the average and fluctuations of the declination distributions of uhecr arrival directions .",
    "the minimal number of sources is determined by requiring that the distribution is consistent with isotropy within the fluctuations and turns out to be 510 .",
    "= 3.5 in    we now investigate whether stronger magnetic fields , by providing larger angular deflection , might provide a better match to the observational data .",
    "in particular , we focus on the case where @xmath50 g , and cen  a is again the unique source of uhecrs . the resulting arrival distribution in declination is shown for several ranges of energies in fig .  [ f4 ] , and the resulting energy spectra , calculated as before , is shown in fig .  [ f5 ] .",
    "increasing the magnetic field strength increases the maximal energy at which diffusion takes place , hence it decreases the anisotropy at each energy up to that maximal energy , and thus reduces the differences between the spectra seen by different detectors ( agasa , uniform , and southern hemisphere analogue of agasa ) .",
    "= 3.5 in    the large - scale anisotropy in this case is much smaller and could not have been detected by northern hemisphere experiments such as the fly s eye and agasa .",
    "the predicted energy spectrum for agasa does provide a very good fit to the observed spectrum , see fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , but the difference is not sufficient to rule out this scenario on this ground .",
    "however , we note that it is unlikely that the highest energy fly s eye event would have been detected in this model .",
    "this event of energy @xmath3eev makes an angle of @xmath51 with the line of sight to cen  a  @xcite . by folding the energy probability distribution for the fly s eye event with the simulated distribution of deflection angles and energies",
    "one finds that 95% of events with a recorded energy corresponding to the fly s eye event are deflected less than @xmath52 .",
    "thus the present observational evidence is not sufficient to rule out with a high degree of confidence the possibility that cen ",
    "a is the source of all ultra - high energy cosmic rays , _ if _ the intervening magnetic field @xmath53 g .",
    "notably , one can not rule out the possibility of having a magnetic configuration different from kolmogorov turbulence , in which case the modification of the energy spectrum would be different than what is shown in the present simulations .",
    "for instance , it has been proposed that the magnetic field is not all pervading , but strongly enhanced in regions close to radio - galaxies that were active in the past  @xcite , in which case the configuration seen by uhecrs would be a collection of scattering centers rather than kolmogorov turbulence .    however , if future or ongoing experiments in the northern hemisphere , e.g. the high resolution fly s eye  @xcite and agasa  @xcite keep recording cosmic rays above @xmath54eev with large deflection angles from the line of sight to cen  a , even the scenario with @xmath55 g would be unequivocally ruled out .",
    "similarly , if no significant anisotropy is seen between these experiments and the pierre auger project  @xcite at the highest energies , the model would be discarded . as an example , we calculate from eq .",
    "( [ expos ] ) the fractional difference @xmath56 of integral fluxes @xmath57 and @xmath58 that would be seen by detectors in the northern and southern hemispheres above a given energy ( for simplicity , we use exposure functions for agasa and an analogous one for the southern hemisphere , as before ) .",
    "we find @xmath59 for @xmath35eev , and @xmath60 for @xmath61eev .",
    "these numbers can also very roughly been estimated from fig .",
    "anisotropies of this size should be easily detectable by a full sky observatory such as the pierre auger project  @xcite which is currently under construction .",
    "we note in this context that we have assumed in all our simulations that the source emits only protons .",
    "if the source is sufficiently compact , protons could convert into neutrons within the source . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , for sources as close as cen  a , neutrons at the highest energies could survive decay and produce a spike in the direction of the source",
    ". this can only increase anisotropy .",
    "preliminary simulations performed with our code indicate that the total flux in the @xmath62 pixel centered on the source is significantly ( i.e. by a factor @xmath63 ) increased only above @xmath64eev .",
    "we stress that @xmath55 g corresponds to the upper limit inferred on the strength of the magnetic field in the local supercluster from faraday rotation observations of distant quasars  @xcite . strictly speaking ,",
    "the rotation measure is a function of @xmath65 , where @xmath27 denotes as before the coherence scale of the field , provided that @xmath66 , where @xmath67 represents the size of the medium pervaded by the magnetic field ( for the local supercluster @xmath68mpc ) . in principle , the coherence length @xmath27 could be smaller than @xmath69mpc , used in the previous section , and @xmath32 correspondingly larger .",
    "however , as will be discussed in the next section , the diffusion coefficient @xmath70 scales inversely proportional with @xmath27 , so that by decreasing @xmath27 , one would increase @xmath70 correspondingly , and the diffusion approximation would break down at a smaller energy , thereby increasing the anisotropy at higher energies .",
    "we thus find that one can not decrease @xmath27 and increase @xmath32 to improve the fit to the data .",
    "moreover , notwithstanding this fact , if diffusion were to be more efficient at the highest energies observed , the effective distance traveled would be consequently increased , and the gzk cut - off would be more pronounced , which would further aggravate the disagreement with the observed spectrum .",
    "we thus conclude that @xmath55 g seems to be the only value of @xmath32 that would be marginally consistent with cen  a as the source of observed uhecrs .",
    "we further note that if equipartition of energy holds , the magnetic field intensity is tied to the thermal energy density of the ambient gas : @xmath71 where @xmath72k is the temperature of the local supercluster in units of @xmath73k , and @xmath74 , with @xmath75 the collapse factor ( i.e. , the local overdensity of baryons and electrons ) , and @xmath76 the hubble constant in units of @xmath77km / s / mpc .",
    "the gas cools by bremsstrahlung emission in the kev range , which in principle can be observed .",
    "a marginal detection of x - ray emission correlated with the plane of the local supercluster has actually been reported and corresponds to a collapse factor @xmath78 , with a weak dependence on the assumed temperature @xmath79k  @xcite ; the signal is however weak and these parameters could be in error .",
    "numerical simulations of large - scale structure formation indicate that @xmath78 and @xmath80k are probably upper limits for sheets such as the local supercluster , and seem to better describe the filamentary structures  @xcite .",
    "deep searches for soft x - ray emission correlated with the plane of the local supercluster using the xmm - newton or chandra observatories could improve these limits , and appear mandatory .",
    "let us now compare these results with analytical estimates in an approach similar to @xcite .",
    "there is often confusion in the literature about different regimes of diffusion and corresponding expressions for the diffusion coefficient .",
    "it is dangerous to take analytical expressions too literally as there exists no analytical derivation of diffusion coefficients in the limit in which the turbulent component of the magnetic fields becomes comparable or stronger than a ( putative ) uniform component , the so - called strong turbulence regime . in this respect , one should note that the formula for the diffusion coefficient given in ref .",
    "@xcite , now used without caution in the community , does not correspond to an analytical derivation .",
    "it is a phenomenological formula , that is furthermore shown to be in error in ref .",
    "@xcite , where analytical approximations and accurate measurements of diffusion coefficients obtained through monte - carlo simulations are presented .",
    "notably , this latter study shows that for kolmogorov turbulence the diffusion coefficient can be approximated as : @xmath81 in this expression , @xmath82 is the uhecr energy in units of @xmath11eev , @xmath83 is the magnetic field strength in units of @xmath22 g , @xmath27 is in units of mpc and @xmath84 ( in units of @xmath11eev ) corresponds to the condition @xmath85 , where @xmath86mpc is the larmor radius .",
    "note the difference of the above result with the formula given in ref .",
    "@xcite , for which @xmath87 for @xmath88 , and @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath70 for @xmath91 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_d ] ) above agrees with the phenomenological bohm diffusion coefficient @xmath92 within a factor two .",
    "the diffusive regime as well as the transition to nearly rectilinear propagation can also be seen in the dependence of time delay @xmath93 ( defined as the difference between the total propagation time and the straight flight distance @xmath94 ) on energy @xmath41 shown in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] for @xmath95 and cen  a as the source : in the diffusive regime the average time delay @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the source distance , whereas for @xmath98 , in the regime of almost rectilinear propagation , @xmath99  @xcite , where @xmath100mpc .",

    "= 3.5 in    note that according to eq .",
    "( [ eq_d ] ) a largest eddy size @xmath27 considerably smaller than 1 mpc ( which is not excluded ) would lead to less diffusion , tending to make anisotropies even larger .    using these results",

    "finds that the ratio of the diffusive propagation time ( which is equal to the time delay in this approximation ) to the source distance reads : @xmath102 , for @xmath90 .",
    "diffusion ceases to be a good approximation when @xmath103 is no longer @xmath104 .",
    "for instance , @xmath105 requires @xmath106 .",
    "this corresponds to a maximal energy for diffusion of @xmath107eev when @xmath21 g , and @xmath64eev when @xmath55 g . these numbers are in agreement with the results of the previous section .",
    "note that the ratio of the diffusive propagation time to the source distance also corresponds to the ratio of the source distance to the mean free path for scattering on the magnetic inhomogeneities @xmath108 within a factor four .",
    "the difference betwen our results and ref .",
    "@xcite can be explained as a misuse of the diffusion coefficient given in ref .",
    "@xcite by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , and to some extent , by the fact that that diffusion coefficient itself has the wrong scaling with @xmath41 , @xmath32 , and @xmath27 .",
    "more precisely in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors use the diffusion coefficient @xmath109  @xcite ( note that the present prefactor is the correct one ; their eq .",
    "( 1 ) has a numerical error ) on the whole energy range , whereas according to ref .",
    "@xcite , this scaling is only valid when @xmath110 , or as above @xmath111 .",
    "this makes an important difference , because , had the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite used the other limiting regime they quote , namely @xmath112 , valid for @xmath113 , they would have found that the ratio of the diffusive distance traveled to source distance reads @xmath114 , which shows that @xmath115 g is necessary to achieve diffusion up to the highest energies @xmath116 .",
    "instead , they used the former approximation , giving @xmath117 , which due to the ( incorrect ) weak scaling would let believe that diffusion can be achieved easily with @xmath118 g on the whole range of energies .",
    "one should mention that the transition between diffusive and rectilinear regimes of propagation is not sudden ; it stretches over half an order to an order of magnitude .",
    "as one approaches this transition , the anisotropy increases steeply to match the small angle deflection in the rectilinear regime @xmath119  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is incorrect to assume that the diffusive estimate for the anisotropy remains valid up to the transition energy .    finally , ref .",
    "@xcite ( unlike ref .",
    "@xcite ) also base their calculations for the flux of particles detected at earth on a time - dependent solution of the diffusion equation , but one should rather use a stationary solution corresponding to a continuously emitting source . indeed",
    "if cen  a were a bursting source , or more generally a source emitting only once on a timescale @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the smallest time delay imparted to all uhecrs , or equivalently , the time delay at the highest energies observed , an experiment like agasa would record events only in a limited range of energies  @xcite .",
    "in other words the distance @xmath122 of the diffusion front from the source at time @xmath123 is given by @xmath124 , and depends on energy .",
    "at the present time at which agasa is operating , the front of low energy particles would not have yet reached the earth , while that of higher energy particles would already have passed . from fig .",
    "[ f6 ] one sees that at any given time agasa would record only part of the total energy spectrum , since particles with @xmath125eev arrive at time @xmath126yrs , while particles with @xmath127eev arrive at times @xmath128yrs .",
    "this implies that if cen ",

    "@xmath131 denotes the spread of time delays at energy @xmath41 , and the condition ensures that the various contributions of the various bursts of particles largely overlap so as to produce a featureless energy spectrum at all times . furthermore , since no low energy cut - off in the energy spectrum has been seen down to energies @xmath132eev , cen  a must have been active for a time corresponding to the largest time delay possible @xmath133 . for @xmath55",

    "the age of centaurus  a can be estimated from the time necessary for its jets to extend to their present size @xmath136kpc , i.e. between @xmath137yrs and a @xmath138gyrs , depending on the deceleration during extension , so that for our purposes this age is essentially unknown .",
    "note that centaurus  a is a radio - galaxy with sub - relativistic jets , and without hot spots ; the lobes are not particularly active , with a total bolometric luminosity @xmath139ergs / s  @xcite",
    ".    the constraints of ref .",
    "@xcite on the energy requirement must thus be reconsidered . in the stationary regime ,",
    "the flux at earth reads @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the injection spectrum at the source .",

    "note that this represents the average power ; the actual power during the phase of activity is higher and reads @xmath148 .",
    "the above @xmath149 is thus a strict lower limit , which is nevertheless more optimistic than the @xmath150ergs / s obtained in ref  @xcite .    as an aside",
    ", we note that the above constraint on the age of centaurus  a can be generalized to any such source of uhecrs , namely that the time delay at the lowest energies be smaller than the age of the source , and thus also the age of the universe .",

    "our detailed numerical simulations show that the model considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which centaurus  a is the source of all observed uhecrs , is inconsistent with the data , at least for the magnetic field strength @xmath21 g put forward by these authors .",
    "we find that for a magnetic field strength @xmath55 g , the predicted energy spectrum is in marginal agreement with that observed by agasa .",
    "however the large deflection angle of the highest energy event ( the fly s eye event ) with respect to the line of sight to cen  a must be explained as a @xmath156 fluctuation .",
    "we also argued that this magnetic field intensity saturates the observational upper bounds from faraday rotations and on x - ray emission from the ambien gas .",

    "we also showed that in order to explain all uhecrs down to @xmath157eev , cen  a must have been producing uhecrs for the past @xmath6gyrs .",
    "all these facts are rather strong requirements on the source and on the intervening magnetic fields .",
