    "<S> it becomes exact . </S>",
    "<S> for the linear time - ramped process , one now replaces the time - dependence by a force - dependence via @xmath46 which leads to the relation p(f)=(1/ ) ( f ) .evans and ritchie @xcite discuss the conditions under which this probability has a peak at non - zero @xmath47 , which is defined as the rupture force . </S>",

    "<S> [ eq : ta ] since @xmath48 with @xmath33 from ( [ eq : t3 ] ) , the mfpt @xmath49 in the adiabatic approximation can be obtained by performing the two integrals numerically .    </S>",

    "<S> the gross features of these data can be understood by identifying three regimes @xcite . for small @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> , one expects naively that the mfpt deviates from the value at zero force if @xmath58 where |q(0)/[(0)(x_s - x_m ) ] . while this ( exponentially small ! ) loading rate also signifies the range where the sccf starts to deviate from the exact data , the adiabatic approximation holds well even for larger loading rates . </S>",
    "<S> this is remarkable since as shown in the appendix systematic perturbation theory reveals that both approximations fail to reproduce the @xmath59 correction to the zero force result for a general potential . </S>",
    "<S> it seems that only in the additional limit of a large activation energy , @xmath60 , is good agreement between the exact result and the adiabatic approximation restored . </S>",
    "<S> a mathematical proof of this feature is beyond the scope of this paper .    for large @xmath8 , both the potential and the diffusion </S>",

    "<S> 2 can be calculated analytically . even though the process in this regime is then no longer thermally - activated </S>",
    "<S> , we include it for two reasons . </S>",
    "<S> first , the mfpt is still mathematically well - defined and can even be calculated analytically in the limit @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> second , for the bond rupture problem described in refs . @xcite and @xcite , this regime has some interest , where it has been called  ultrafast \" . </S>",
    "<S> the time - ramped equation of motion becomes @xmath62 with the solution @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the exact asymptotic result t(x , ) [ eq : ex ] and hence to @xmath57 as mentioned above @xcite .    for the sccf approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the equation of motion becomes @xmath64 , which leads to @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> replacing @xmath9 by @xmath66 yields the relation t_s(x , ) and hence @xmath67 for large @xmath8 . in the same limit </S>",
    "<S> , the adiabatic approximation can be calculated by performing the integrals in ( [ eq : ta ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> one obtains @xmath68 which is closer to the exact result than the sccf approximation .    in an intermediate @xmath69regime </S>",
    "<S> , the behavior can be extracted most easily from the sccf approximation . from the relations @xmath70 one obtains @xmath71 and thus @xmath56 with logarithmic corrections . expressed in terms of a mean rupture force @xmath72 </S>",
    "<S> , this behavior corresponds to @xmath73 @xcite . as fig </S>",
    "<S> . 1 shows , the data show a large crossover with an effective exponent @xmath74 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions  _ in this paper , we have analysed diffusive escape over a barrier in the presence of a time - dependent force . </S>",
    "<S> we have derived an exact pde for the mean first passage time and solved it both by numerical integration and by use of two approximations . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the ( numerically ) exact solution with the adiabatic approximation introduced previously shows that this approximation holds remarkably well for a large range of loading rates . </S>",
    "<S> formally , our exact equation for the mfpt can easily be generalized to include space - dependent diffusion coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , both motion in higher dimensions and inclusion of inertia terms ( for smaller friction ) are amenable to the same treatment . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical solution of the corresponding equivalent of ( [ eq : t2 ] ) , however , will become quite time - consuming . </S>",
    "<S> it will then be helpful to explore the two approximations whose virtues we discussed for our model case .    </S>",
