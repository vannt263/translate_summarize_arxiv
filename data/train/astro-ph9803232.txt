    "it is quite established nowadays , that neutron stars have a large hyperon fraction in the core and might be described as giant hypernuclei , though bound by gravity @xcite . here again , the presence of hyperons might restrict certain properties of the h dibaryon .",
    "recently , studies for neutron stars have been done for nuclear matter without hyperons but including h dibaryon condensation @xcite and limits have been set for the coupling constants of the h dibaryon @xcite .",

    "we are particularly interested in the question of whether neutron stars and their masses can be used to say anything about the existence and properties of the h dibaryon . in section [ sec : comp ] , we discuss the condition for the occurrence of dibaryons and strangelets in neutron star matter . the relativistic mean field model with hyperons and the h dibaryon",

    "implications for a h dibaryon condensate are discussed in section [ sec : results ] and summarized in the last section .",
    "here we discuss the general features of the appearance of composite quark objects in neutron star matter .",
    "nuclei will dissolve in dense matter due to a mott transition at quite low density .",
    "hence , hypernuclei with similar binding energies will also dissolve .",
    "the situation is different for strangelets , if they are energetically favored compared to hadrons .",
    "then strangelets will appear at a certain critical density which will depend on the chemical potentials and the mass of the strangelet .",
    "the most stable strangelet candidates will have a closed shell , i.e.they have zero total spin and are bosons .",
    "also the h dibaryon ( consisting of two u , d , and s quarks ) has zero spin and will form a bose condensate if it appears in dense matter .",
    "the general condition for a bose condensation of strangelets is that the effective energy must be equal to the chemical potential : @xmath14 where b stands for the baryon number and z for the charge of the strangelet with mass @xmath15 .",
    "the corresponding chemical potentials are @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( unit baryon and unit negative electric charge , respectively ) .",
    "@xmath18 is the potential felt by a strangelet in a dense environment . neglecting interaction and modification of the mass in the medium",
    ", the threshold condition for the appearance of a strangelet is @xmath19 hence , the baryochemical potential determines the onset of condensation as the charge to baryon ratio is between @xmath20 and @xmath21 and the electrochemical potential is much weaker .",
    "we illustrate threshold conditions for the h dibaryon ( or any other strangelet with assumed free mass per baryon of 1.1 gev ) in fig .",
    "[ chempot ] under two circumstances : ( 1 ) free dibaryon , and ( 2 ) dibaryon whose mass is modified by the medium .",
    "the two solid curves represent the dibaryon mass per baryon under these two circumstances .",
    "more generally , the chemical potentials for a strangelet with @xmath22 , 0 , and @xmath23 are also plotted .",
    "the point where these lines intersect and rise above the mass per nucleon for a particular strangelet marks the density threshold above which the strangelet in question would comprise one of the constituents of matter .",
    "the threshold for free and medium modified dibaryons ( or strangelets ) of free mass per baryon of 1.1 gev can be read from the intersections .",

    "a similar analysis can be done for other strangelet candidates .",
    "however , strangelets with mass numbers of @xmath31 are not stable due to a repulsive color magnetic interaction except for the h dibaryon @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , strange dibaryon states have been predicted to be bound in a relativistic quark potential model @xcite .",
    "negatively charged candidates are e.g.  @xmath32 and @xmath33 which are heavier than the h dibaryon but might appear at a similar density as the h due to their negative charge .",
    "it has been also proposed in the mit bag model that negatively charged strangelets with closed shells are likely to be most stable against strong and weak emission of hadrons @xcite .",
    "the candidates with a closed shell found are e.g.for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , for @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",

    "[ chempot ] , the negatively charged strangelets would appear in neutron stars at densities above @xmath43 if their masses are lower than @xmath44 ( assuming no interactions ) . therefore , if strangelets do not feel too high a repulsive potential in the medium they can appear as a bose condensate in neutron stars . in the following",
    "we will discuss the modification of the properties of neutron stars due to the appearance of a strangelet condensate .",
    "we choose to study the case of the h dibaryon as it is the lightest candidate and might appear first in dense matter .",
    "first note that the h dibaryon is a boson with zero spin and isospin .",
    "we use the standard extended @xmath45 model to describe the baryon sector interacting through the mesons @xmath46 where @xmath47 is summed over all states of the baryon octet , the scalar meson is denoted by @xmath48 , the vector mesons are denoted by @xmath49 and @xmath50 for the iso - scalar and iso - vector meson and @xmath51 .",
    "we have taken into account possible self - interaction terms for the scalar field @xmath52 @xcite and for the vector field @xcite @xmath53 the h dibaryon is coupled to the mean fields by a minimal coupling scheme following @xcite : @xmath54 where the vector fields are coupled via the standard replacement @xmath55 this ensures consistency with ward identities , i.e.  the vector fields are coupled to a conserved current .",
    "the effective mass of the h is defined as in the baryon case @xmath56 this gives , as for the vector field , a quadratic coupling term of the h to the scalar field in the lagrangian ( [ eq : lagh ] ) .",
    "it turns out , that with this choice of coupling , the scalar and vector density for the h are the same in the mean field approximation .",
    "it was also shown that this model is thermodynamically consistent @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion is simply @xmath57 h(\\omega,\\vec{k } ) = 0 \\quad .\\ ] ] for s - wave condensation ( @xmath58 ) one gets the dispersion relation @xmath59 in the mean field approximation , where @xmath30 is the baryochemical potential .",
    "this relation fixes the amplitude of the h dibaryon condensate .",
    "the density of the h dibaryon is increased until the effective energy of the h dibaryon is equal to its chemical potential .",
    "note that this implies that there must be a repulsive potential between the h dibaryons at a certain h dibaryon density .",
    "otherwise , the effective energy is decreasing with increasing h dibaryon density and it will never attain its chemical potential .",
    "we do not repeat the full set of equations for the baryons as they can be found in e.g.  @xcite in detail .",
    "we note the additional terms due to the h dibaryon condensate in the equations of motion @xmath60 here one needs to define only one density for the h dibaryon due to the dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp ] ) @xmath61 the h dibaryon contributes to the energy density in the form @xmath62 but contributes to the pressure only indirectly through the modification of the meson fields via the additional terms in the equations of motion .",
    "there exists various parameterizations in the literature for the nucleon - nucleon interactions in the mean field model .",
    "the parameters are either fixed by nuclear matter properties or fitted to properties of spherical nuclei .",
    "for example , the parameter set used in @xcite with scalar self - interactions @xmath52 corresponds to the nuclear matter properties : @xmath63 mev , @xmath64 @xmath25 , @xmath65 mev , @xmath66 mev , @xmath67 ( which for brevity we refer to as gm91 ) .",
    "the parameter set tm1 @xcite has been fitted to the binding energy , radii , and surface thickness of heavy nuclei .",
    "the latter model has a self - interaction term for the vector field @xmath68 .",
    "this set has been used in @xcite .",
    "we adopt these two models as guidelines in the following .",
    "the hyperon coupling constants have also been chosen differently .",
    "we will consider two cases : ( 1 ) universal coupling of the hyperons and ( 2 ) coupling constants using su(6 ) relations . in the former case ,",
    "all hyperons are coupled equally @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 stands for the hyperons @xmath3 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "note that the @xmath3 has isospin zero , the @xmath71 has isospin 1 , while the @xmath72 and nucleon have isospin 1/2 .",
    "this gives an additional factor of 2 for the @xmath73 term in the lagrangian and a vanishing iso - vector coupling constant for the @xmath3 .",
    "in the other case , su(6 ) relations @xcite are used for the vector coupling constants of the hyperons @xmath74 which scale according to the number of light quarks of the baryon . the iso - vector coupling constants scale with the isospin like in the universal case but are fixed differently to the nucleon iso - vector coupling constant . in our notation",
    "this means @xmath75 the su(6 ) symmetry takes already care of the isospin so that the notation as used in @xcite @xmath76 means the same .",
    "it reflects the strength of the iso - vector potentials of the baryons but starts then from a different , su(3)-symmetric lagrangian .    both cases , universal and su(6 ) , are consistent with @xmath3 hypernuclear data insofar as the potential depth of the @xmath3 in normal nuclear matter is fixed to its phenomenological value of @xmath77 mev .",
    "for the universal case the vector coupling constants are adjusted to this potential depth for all hyperons . for the su(6 )",
    "case the scalar coupling constants are adjusted .",
    "note that in addition , the su(6 ) coupling scheme ( quark model ) is successful in describing the small @xmath3-hypernuclear spin - orbit splitting @xcite .",
    "the value of the coupling constants of the h to the scalar and the vector field , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are unknown .",
    "they must satisfy two constraints : ( i ) the h should not appear in normal nuclear matter , and ( ii ) the interaction should allow for neutron star masses at least as large as the well established mass of the hulse - taylor pulsar .",
    "the simple quark counting rule suggests that @xmath80 as the h has four light quarks .",
    "this choice is motivated from the success of using su(6 ) ( quark model ) relations for hyperons in describing hypernuclear properties @xcite .",
    "we use it to fix @xmath79 .",
    "having fixed the vector coupling without regard to the above constraints ( i ) and ( ii ) , the burden of satisfying the constraints falls on the scalar coupling ( against the background of the other couplings defining the lagrangian of the theory ) .    to fix the scalar coupling @xmath78 we consider the following .",
    "a range for the scalar coupling constant @xmath78 can be determined from values of the h potential in the medium at @xmath81 @xmath82 because the meson fields are known .",
    "the h potential at @xmath81 should not be deeper than @xmath83 else the h dibaryon would condense at normal nuclear matter density .",
    "we choose specific discrete values in the range of @xmath84 , 0 , 30 mev . to each",
    ", a specific value of @xmath78 is implied through eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) .",
    "we will find that potentials deeper than @xmath85 mev would decrease the limiting neutron star mass below observed masses ( at least in the parameterizations of the lagrangian that we have considered ) .",
    "the energy of the h dibaryon is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : henrg ] for neutron star matter including hyperons for the various h potentials .",
    "the h dibaryon feels a repulsive potential above normal nuclear density irrespective of the chosen potential at @xmath81 .",
    "the repulsive high density behavior arises from the interaction of the h and the vector meson .",
    "this repulsion generally dominates at high density unless the scalar interaction is too strong .",
    "we discuss this issue below .",
    "the slope at high density is quite similar for the set gm91 and the curves for the different h potentials are just shifted .",
    "the vector potential dominates at high density and is chosen to be the same ( 4/3 that of the nucleon ) in all three cases giving the same slope at high density .",
    "the shift comes from the differences in the scalar potential which saturates at high density .",
    "the behavior at high density is quite different for the parameter set tm1 . here",
    "the vector potential has a nonlinear dependence on the baryon density due to the vector field selfinteraction terms .",
    "note that the h energy and thus the baryon chemical potential stays rather constant with density for the lowest curve ( @xmath86 mev ) .",
    "it is especially clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : henrg ] that the vacuum mass of the h is not as crucial to the appearance of the h in neutron stars as its interactions with vector and scalar mesons .    in place of the above considerations for fixing a range for the scalar coupling constant , faessler et al .",
    "@xcite invoked the condition @xmath87 on the grounds that otherwise the yukawa potential between h dibaryons would yield a negative compressibility .",
    "this is true at low density .",
    "for example , for the parameter set gm91 we find that h matter is unstable against compression _ at low density _",
    "when @xmath88 mev .",
    "for the parameter set tm1 the low density instability arises when @xmath89 mev .",
    "however , the situation is more complicated .",
    "even if the equation of state has a negative slope at low density , it can become positive at higher density .",
    "whether or not , can not be stated in terms of the inequality of eq .",
    "( [ ineq ] ) but involves all of the other interactions and particle types in matter .",
    "test of the low density behavior is therefore insufficient .",
    "because gravity compresses a star , the question of stability arises for condensed matter , not for low density matter . for the above quoted models",
    "the scalar and vector potentials have a different ( nonlinear ) behavior at high density which can alter the low - density conclusion .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ hmatterall ] .",
    "the binding energy of pure h dibaryon matter is shown for the two parameter sets and the three different choices of the h dibaryon potential in nuclear matter .",
    "one sees that the compressibility , which is proportional to the slope of the curves , is negative at low density for @xmath86 mev for both parameter sets .",
    "nevertheless , the scalar self - interactions provide a nonlinear dependence of the scalar potential on the density ( here h dibaryon number density ) .",
    "this results in an overall repulsive potential for pure h matter at higher density and a minimum around normal nuclear density .",
    "hence h matter can be stable at high density even if the low density limit seems to indicate an instability .",
    "with reference to fig .",
    "[ hmatterall ] , we see that even more complicated situations can arise . for the parameter set tm1 , the vector self - interactions cause the energy density due to the vector potential to rise like @xmath90 instead of like @xmath91 , as for the linear behavior in the standard walecka model .",
    "it can then happen that the scalar potential wins ultimately over the vector potential at very high density .",
    "such a case is seen in figure  [ hmatterall ] for the lowest dashed curve : the equation of state has a local minimum around normal nuclear density but the compressibility becomes negative again at higher density .",
    "the instability for pure h matter does not mean that a neutron star with a h condensate is unstable against compressional modes , as the overall compressibility can still be positive .",
    "this will depend on the intrinsic stiffness of the equation of state used and the hadron population inside the neutron star .",
    "a recent analysis considered neutron star matter consisting of nucleons and leptons only @xcite and found rather stringent conditions for the coupling constant of the h dibaryon .",
    "the appearance of hyperons already at @xmath92 @xcite will certainly alter their conclusions and will be discussed in the following .",
    "to give an early impression of the possible presence of h dibaryons in neutron stars under acceptable conditions as to ( 1 ) its absence in normal matter , and ( 2 ) an acceptable value for the limiting mass neutron star , we compare the populations of the limiting mass star in the absence of the dibaryons and in their presence , in figs .",
    "[ comp_h_k240m78_su6 ] and [ comp_h_k240m78_su6_uhm30 ] .",
    "hyperons appear abundantly in the interior of the neutron star .",
    "the hyperons @xmath3 and @xmath93 reach values close to the proton density in the stellar core .",
    "protons are more abundant once the negatively charged hyperons @xmath94 and @xmath93 are present to compensate the charge of the proton . as can be seen in fig.[comp_h_k240m78_su6_uhm30 ] , particle populations are strongly modified in the core of the star where the dibaryon appears .",
    "the proton population is suppressed since baryon number is carried more in the h bosons . likewise the hyperon populations are strongly suppressed .",
    "this is not to say that these baryons have little influence on the h presence .",
    "it is in matter containing significant @xmath94 and @xmath3 populations that the h threshold is attained . outside the core , beyond @xmath95 km , populations and the stellar radius",
    "are hardly changed by the presence of the h in the core and therefore cooling of the star would be little effected by the h. h dibaryons could lie within the star while providing no direct sign of their presence .",
    "generally the maximum mass of a neutron star is lowered due to h dibaryon condensation because the condensate does not contribute directly to the pressure and it removes the pressure due to two baryons per dibaryon in the condensate .",
    "the equation of state is thereby softened . as the maximum mass should be not lower than @xmath96 ( the mass of the hulse - taylor pulsar )",
    ", one can try to impose constraints on the _ medium _ mass of the h dibaryon .",

    "one might infer from the figure , that very attractive potentials for the h of @xmath102 mev can be ruled out by neutron star data .",
    "nevertheless , such a conclusion must be moderated by our ignorance of the h dibaryon mass .",
    "the appearance of the h condensation depends on the in - medium potential at high density and the mass of the h dibaryon which are unknown .",

    "the maximum mass is then @xmath96 .",
    "this is the lowest value allowed by present observation .",
    "the plateau comes from the fact , that the equation of state has a nearly constant pressure for the particular coupling due to the appearance of the h dibaryon .",
    "a more attractive potential than @xmath86 mev would result in a negative curvature of the pressure and therefore in an unstable equation of state . note , that this behavior is mainly related to the potential between the h dibaryons as discussed in connection with pure h dibaryon matter ( see figure  [ hmatterall ] ) .",

    "hyperons tend to shift the onset of the h to higher density or to prevent h dibaryon condensation . if the condensation happens and if the potential of the h is attractive enough to provide a substantial number density in the neutron star , the maximum mass of the neutron star is reduced compared to the case without the h dibaryon .",
    "the decrease of the maximum mass is moderate and allows for the presence of h dibaryons in the interior of neutron stars in accord with present neutron star mass data .",

    "hence , small bubbles of strange quark matter will appear in the mixed phase which are most likely negatively charged due to the isospin potential of the nuclear matter .",
    "this is in line with the results presented here .",
    "as the most stable strangelets have spin zero , the onset to a quark plasma will be initiated by a bose condensation of strangelets ( possibly including the h dibaryon ) .",
    "as the phase transition proceeds , the bubbles will overlap and will finally replace nuclear matter by essentially filling up the whole volume .",

    "<S> we study the influence of a possible h dibaryon condensate on the equation of state and the overall properties of neutron stars whose population otherwise contains nucleons and hyperons . in particular , we are interested in the question of whether neutron stars and their masses can be used to say anything about the existence and properties of the h dibaryon . </S>",
