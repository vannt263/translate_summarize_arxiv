    "in a celebrated paper @xcite , ted jacobson presented a surprising thermodynamical derivation of einstein s equations , based on three inputs : ( i ) the vacuum of a quantum field theory in minkowski space behaves as a thermal state at the unruh temperature t= for an observer with acceleration @xmath0 ; ( ii ) there is a _ universal _ entropy density @xmath1 per unit area , associated to any causal horizon in a locally minkowski patch of spacetime , giving an entropy s= [ unruht ] for a horizon region of area @xmath2 ; and ( iii ) a local entropy balance relation s= [ clausiusr ] holds , where @xmath3 is an energy exchange . by interpreting @xmath3 as the energy of matter flowing across the local rindler horizon of the accelerated observer , and matching the variation of the area with the focusing effect of spacetime curvature , jacobson was able to show that if the three equations above hold for _ any _ _ local _ frame , then einstein s equations follow .",
    "this is a beautiful piece of theoretical physics . but its interpretation is not clear .",
    "a common understanding @xcite takes the result as evidence that einstein s equations have a statistical origin and should be interpreted as equations of state for unknown underlying degrees of freedom , with the metric being a macroscopic  coarse - grained \" variable . in this paper",
    "we show that a different interpretation is possible .",
    "the alternative interpretation , which we develop mostly following @xcite , is based on the fact that the gravitational field has quantum properties .",
    "the microscopic degrees of freedom are those of the quantum gravitational field and the einstein equations express only the classical limit of the dynamics .",
    "the entropy across the horizon measures the entanglement between adjacent spacetime regions .",
    "its finiteness is evidence for the quantization of the gravitational field : this is analogous to the fact that the finiteness of the black - body electromagnetic entropy is evidence for the quantization of the electromagnetic field .",
    "we show that the jacobson result is consistent with this simpler and tighter scenario .",
    "the finiteness and the universality of the entanglement entropy across spacetime regions indicates ultraviolet quantum discreteness , as it did for planck and einstein at the beginning of the xx century .",

    "the first describes simply a translation of the standard classical entropy of gibbs and boltzmann .",

    "now , consider a small variation @xmath22 of the state @xmath23 .",
    "the change in entanglement entropy @xmath24 is proportional to the change in the averaged energy , namely @xmath25   = \\beta\\ , \\tr[\\delta \\rho_\\beta h ] = \\beta\\ , \\delta \\langle h\\rangle .",

    "equation takes the form of a thermodynamical relation s= e / t .",
    "[ clau ] equation is a relation of equilibrium .",
    "however , there is no thermodynamical limit , no large number of degrees of freedom in the argument above . in the simple context of a two - degrees of freedom system",
    ", @xmath27 does not have an interpretation as temperature .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we have many copies of this coupled system , and a thermometer coupled with them all , then @xmath27 can be interpreted as a temperature .",
    "indeed it determines the raising and lowering transition probabilities between thermometer eigenstates that thermalizes to the probability distribution p~e^-e where @xmath28 is the energy difference between the thermometer states .",
    "this result follows from the fact that is a kms state for the time flow , and its proof is recalled in appendix [ a ] .",
    "the example above might sound artificial , since the one - parameter family of states was introduced ad hoc .",
    "but it is not so artificial : in fact , its structure exemplifies that of the minkowski vacuum @xmath29 under the split of the fock space into the tensor product of a hilbert space capturing the degrees of freedom accessible from within the horizon of a uniformly accelerating observer , and those outside ( rindler wedge localization ) @xcite . the minkowski state is a pure state and when restricted to the rindler wedge",
    "observables it turns out to be given by the density matrix = _",
    "|0_m0_m|= n e^-k [ rhok ] where @xmath30 is the boost generator",
    ". this is the content of the bisognano - wichmann theorem @xcite , which can be derived rigorously from quantum field theory axioms , or formally with a variety of simple manipulations .",
    "it is a consequence of lorentz invariance and positivity of the energy .    the motion of a uniformly accelerated observer is precisely generated by @xmath30 .",
    "the proper time @xmath31 of an observer moving at constant acceleration @xmath0 is given by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the boost parameter of the transformation generated by @xmath30 .",
    "therefore once rescaled by @xmath0 , @xmath30 generates proper time translations on the world line of a uniformly accelerated observer , that is h = a k [ ak ] is the generator of the evolution in the proper time in the rindler wedge . as a consequence ,",
    "the density matrix that represents the outcome of measurements on the spacetime region bounded by the horizon of an accelerated observer in the _ pure _ state @xmath29 can be rewritten as = _",
    "|0_m0_m|= n e^-h , [ rhoa ] where t=1= , [ unruh ] which is the unruh temperature associated to an observer accelerating in the minkowski quantum - field vacuum @xcite .",
    "the unruh temperature is a physical temperature : it determines the transition probabilities of a system interacting with the quantum field and moving along the accelerated trajectory .",
    "this shows that under appropriate conditions the quantum mechanical entanglement can define a temperature which is the temperature measured by a physical thermometer .",
    "in particular , this happens when the density matrix obtained by reducing the state to a subalgebra has the form for a hamiltonian @xmath18 generating a flow that can be identified with the time evolution of the thermometer .",
    "parenthetically we note that the density matrix associated to a subsystem can _ generically _ be written in the form ~e^- h for _ some _ hermitian operator @xmath18 .",
    "it suffices to define @xmath18 as minus the log of @xmath34 .",
    "the quantity @xmath18 defined in this manner is called the `` entanglement hamiltonian '' , `` modular hamiltonian''@xcite or `` thermal time '' @xcite hamiltonian in various contexts .",
    "it generates an `` evolution '' in the hilbert space @xmath5 , and the state @xmath34 is a kms state with respect to this flow . in general",
    "this flow does not correspond to a flow in spacetime . in the case of the restriction of vacuum to a rindler wedge",
    ", it does .",
    "the thermodynamical aspects of the setting considered by jacobson can be understood in this framework .",
    "there is a quantum field in its vacuum seen by an accelerated observer .",
    "the observer interacts only with a sub algebra of the field observable algebra , and therefore describes the state of the field in terms of a density matrix .",
    "the entropy that quantifies the incertitude , due to entanglement , of an observer s measurement , and the expectation value of the generator of his proper - time translations are related by , namely s = e / t .",
    "the unruh temperature and the entropy s= e [ ds ] can be computed directly from the form of the entangled state @xmath34 .",
    "these are relations that pertain to standard quantum field theory and do not require any additional hypothesis about underlying degrees of freedom to be true .",
    "they depend on the local lorentz invariance of the vacuum and in particular on its local ( short scale ) consequences .",
    "general relativity plays no role so far .",
    "equation has nothing to do with the einstein equations .",
    "in particular , the relation @xmath35 knows nothing about the newton constant or the einstein equations .",
    "how do then einstein s equations emerge in jacobson s argument ?",
    "the key ingredient of jacobson s derivation is the assumption that the entropy density per unit horizon area is not only finite , but , most importantly , _",
    "universal_. that is , in the relation s = a , [ key ] it is assumed that @xmath36 is finite and does not depend on any detail of the physical situation . here",
    ", @xmath2 is the area of the 2-dimensional spacelike bifurcation surface of the causal horizon comprising the wedge .",
    "this universality is a strong assumption that falsely may appear to be innocent .",
    "the fact that the entropy across a region is proportional to the area is common when correlations are sufficiently short scale compared to the geometry of the surface .",
    "however , in general the proportionality constant will depend on the system and on the state .",
    "jacobson assumes it does not .",
    "the entropy density of the density matrix is infinite , because of the contribution of arbitrarily short wavelength correlations across the rindler horizon .",
    "if we cut off the theory at some length @xmath37 , we obtain an entropy that scales as @xmath38 @xcite , that is s= a or @xmath39 . if we change the state , the area does not change ( we are on a fixed geometry ) but the entropy does change , therefore s=(a ) = ( ) a .",
    "[ dkey ] if one instead assumes , as jacobson does , that the proportionality constant between entropy and area is universal , then one either gets a contradiction ( because one can change the entropy by changing the state ) , or one has to relax the fact that the geometry is fixed and allow it to change with a change in the state , thus allowing the area to vary s = a. [ ddkey ] as we have seen above the entanglement entropy across a surface satisfies the relation @xmath40 , where @xmath28 is an energy",
    ". therefore we obtain e = t a , [ ddkey ] and as a consequence if the constant @xmath36 is to be universal , area and energy variations must be related .",
    "inserting the value of @xmath27 from equation into leads to the fundamental relation e= a. [ ar_en ] notice that this relation has nothing thermodynamical in it .",
    "it is a relation between energy and geometry .",
    "this relation was derived by frodden , gosh and perez @xcite in a different context as a consequence of the einstein equations ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the frodden - gosh - perez relation reads e = a [ fgp ] . and agrees with identifying the universal constant @xmath36 as @xmath41 .",
    "thus , what jacobson has shown in his derivation ( which we recall in appendix [ c ] ) is that equation is not only a consequence of einstein s equations , but is also a _ sufficient _",
    "condition for the einstein equations to hold .",
    "if we assume the validity of in any frame , then the einstein equations follow . in this sense , einstein s equations are encoded in the proportionality between classical variation of energy and horizon area , as measured by a uniformly accelerating observer .    by itself ,",
    "the fact that the einstein equations can be encoded in a single simple equation relating an energy and a geometrical quantity is well known .",
    "of course the trick is requiring that this holds everywhere and in any frame , thus adding general covariance as an independent input .",
    "for instance , see the nice paper by john baez and emory bunn @xcite where it is pointed out that einstein s equations follow entirely from the request that the second variation of the volume of a small sphere of particles is proportional to the sum of the energy and momentum flow components in the centre of the sphere .",
    "jacobson s is an elegant and null version of baez and bunn s timelike result .",
    "the important point of this discussion is that jacobson s result can be split into two parts .",
    "the second part being the step from to the einstein equations .",
    "this is a nice piece of differential geometry , but has nothing to do with thermodynamics .",
    "the first step is to get to equation .",
    "as we have seen , this equation comes from considering the entanglement entropy across the horizon plus a universality assumption . again , here statistical considerations play no role , and nothing points to underlying degrees of freedom , or to a reading of the einstein equations as equations of state .",
    "the key is simply the universality of the entanglement entropy - density .",
    "we comment on this below .",
    "the interpretation of the bekenstein entropy as entanglement entropy has been called into question precisely due to the unclear dependence of the entanglement entropy on the number of species at the cutoff scale .",
    "how can entanglement entropy not be dependent on the number of species ?",
    "a recent result @xcite has shown that for a low energy perturbation of the minkowski vacuum , the variation of entanglement entropy @xmath42 across the rindler horizon is independent from the number of matter species and independent from the ultraviolet cut - off , provided one includes gravitons together with matter fields , in a perturbative approach .",
    "what happens is that the change in the energy of the vacuum @xmath43 , expressed in terms of the energy - momentum of matter _ and _ gravitons @xmath44 , is related to the dalambertian of the graviton field by means of the perturbative einstein equations , h_= - ( t_-1 2 _ t^ _ ) , [ epertu ] from which e = a [ reja ] follows .",
    "the change in the area of the causal horizon has now a _",
    "semiclassical _ interpretation .",
    "classical background geometry is not affected , and the perturbation of the area is determined by the quantum gravitational field @xmath45 and given by the expectation value of the operator @xmath46 associated to the first order _ variation _ of the area with respect to its background value , as a function of @xmath45 .",
    "that is @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "this perturbation controls the deflection of light rays related to the expansion of the area of the horizon surface , so that equations , and together provide a dynamical bekenstein - hawking area law relation , s= , [ beke ] which relies on the entanglement of the gravitationally dressed vacuum fields .",
    "importantly , equation does not depend on the physics at the uv scale , as @xmath48 involves only differences in the low energy modes , while its universal character has a dynamical origin : it derives from the universal coupling of gravitons to the energy momentum tensor .    at the perturbative level",
    ", this result provides a connection between bekenstein - hawking entropy and entanglement entropy and indicates that the relation between area and energy variations in can only have a dynamical origin : it requires the einstein equations .",
    "this connection between bekenstein - hawking entropy and entanglement entropy is not in terms of statistical ignorance about mysterious underlying microscopic degrees of freedom , it does not imply any `` thermal '' characterization of the einstein equations .",
    "the universality of @xmath36 is the effect of an active role of gravitational dynamics at the quantum level .",
    "one can gain an intuitive understanding of the fact that gravity cuts the degrees of freedom off in a universal manner as follows .",
    "the quantum gravitational regime starts when the total energy density reaches the planck scale .",
    "matter fluctuations interact gravitationally , so in the presence of more than one field , say @xmath11 fields , this regime is reached at a larger length scale than in the presence of a single field",
    ". more precisely , if we introduce a cutoff at the scale @xmath49 , on dimensional grounds the vacuum energy density of the fluctuations of _ a single _ field is proportional to @xmath50 . within an @xmath51 volume",
    ", the ( negative ) gravitational potential energy of these fluctuations goes as @xmath52 and is proportional to @xmath53 because each field interacts with any other field .",
    "we enter in a strong gravitational field regime at the scale where these two energies balance , namely at the length scale @xmath54 .",
    "thus , for a single field we expect a gravitational cutoff at the planck scale @xmath55 , but for @xmath11 fields the cutoff scale is reached at a larger scale by a factor @xmath56 , that is , the cutoff scale @xmath49 depends on the number of fields as ~. the entanglement entropy of @xmath11 fields is s~n where @xmath49 is the cutoff scale .",
    "the last two equations together indicate that @xmath57 does not depend on the number of fields @xcite .",
    "it is the universality of gravity , not statistics , that determines the entanglement entropy universality of the entropy density .",
    "so far , we have stayed away from the planck scale .",
    "it is time to ask what may happen there and complete the picture .",
    "at the beginning of the xx century , planck and einstein were led to the existence of a fundamental discreteness in the structure of the electromagnetic field , and in fact to the discovery of the existence of the photon , from the absence of the  ultraviolet catastrophe , \" namely from the finiteness of the entropy of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the entropy of black body radiation , indeed , is given by s= 43  , where @xmath58 is the volume of the box and @xmath59 the energy , and this diverges if we take @xmath60 .",
    "quantum theory is the source of the planck - size granularity that renders phase space volumes finite , and therefore avoids the divergence of the entropy . in the entropy , associated to a gravitational field",
    ", @xmath61 is in the denominator as well .",
    "this indicates that it is quantum mechanics that cuts off the divergence of the entropy .",
    "in fact , the formula indicates that there should be a physical ( real ) quantum mechanical cutoff at the planck scale .",
    "this is precisely the conclusion that one obtains from a full quantum gravitational treatment of the problem in the context of loop quantum gravity , where the _ discreteness _ of the geometry at the planck scale appears as a conventional quantization effect : the gravitational field determines lengths , areas and volumes ; since the gravitational field is a quantum operator , these quantities are given by quantum operators .",
    "planck scale discreteness follows from the spectral analysis of such operators , which indicates minimum non - vanishing sizes at the planck scale .",
    "this is the key result of the loop theory and is responsible for the uv finiteness of the entropy density .",
    "let us see how jacobson s result emerges from this framework .",
    "for this , we recall some basic notions from the full theory , relevant to the present discussion @xcite .    in loop gravity ,",
    "quantum states of the geometry are described by @xmath62 spin networks .",
    "let us consider here for simplicity a single link of the spin network .",
    "the corresponding quantum state is a function @xmath63 on @xmath62 , and @xmath59 is classically interpreted as the open path holonomy of the gravitational ashtekar connection along the link .",
    "a basis of states is provided by the wigner matrices ( peter - weyl theorem ) u| j , m , n= d^(j)_mn(u ) .",

    "this is a direct way of deriving the einstein equations from the covariant loop quantum dynamics .",
    "next , observe that the tensor product structure in is related to a local `` partition of space '' into two chunks , associated to the _ source _ and _ target _ nodes at the two ends of the link .",
    "in fact , the gravitational field operators , which are given by the left invariant and right invariant vector fields act respectively on the source and target end , and correspond to measurements performed on one side or the other of the facet @xcite .",
    "it therefore makes sense to define a half - link hilbert space associated to each end of the link .",

    ", a classical measurement of the facet state dynamics is associated to the covariant dynamics of the trajectory of the accelerated observer .",
    "this can be seen either passively as a motion of an observer in spacetime or actively as the evolution of spacetime seen by an observer .",
    "written in terms of the accelerated observer s quantities , the density matrix in reads _ f = ne^-",
    "h [ gibbser2 ] and the expectation value of the hamiltonian operator @xmath18 gives e = [ kk3 ] where @xmath107 has now the dimensions of an energy .",
    "this is exactly relation , the core physical input from which the einstein equations , as shown by jacobson , follow in the classical limit .    to the _ ensemble _ of single facet states given by ,",
    "the observer can effectively associate an absolute temperature , via the general definition t== . because if it interacts with a large number of these , this is the temperature determining the transition probabilities between its eigenstates .",
    "this is the unruh temperature .",
    "therefore all the ingredients for jacobson s derivation follow ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we have illustrated how geometrical discreteness arises in the formalism of loop gravity and shown that this discreteness gives rise to all of jacobson s inputs microscopically .",
    "this line of thinking has exposed the possibility that local lorentz invariance is encoded directly in the quantum correlations at the planck scale and led us to introduce quantum gravitational hadamard states .",
    "we further develop this idea below .",
    "in covariant loop quantum gravity @xcite the dynamics is captured by a relation between the area of a spacelike surface ( say in the @xmath92-@xmath93 plane ) and the boost ( in the @xmath94-@xmath95 plane ) .",
    "this is beautifully made explicit by the result of jacobson , which shows that yields the einstein equations .",
    "the dynamical input that gives the einstein equations in jacobson s derivation is not the thermodynamics .",
    "it is the relation between the boost generator and the area .",
    "this is the input that contains the newton constant @xmath108 and gives the dynamics .",
    "then , the presence of the horizon leads to the entanglement that gives rise to the entropy , and the relation between this entropy and the boost generator determines the kms temperature .    in the case of a black hole ,",
    "as shown in @xcite , the entropy at infinity , the energy at infinity ( adm mass ) and the temperature at infinity ( the hawking temperature ) are simply obtained by red shifting the local quantities to infinity .",
    "their relation is precisely the local clausius relation redshifted to infinity .",
    "this is unproblematic standard physics ( much like the tolman law ) and is well understood .",
    "these considerations do not put into question the tight constraints of reciprocal consistency that gravitational dynamics and thermodynamics of the vacuum state impose on each other ; a consistency that jacobson s derivation sheds light on .",
    "it is quite remarkable , indeed , that so much of the gravitational dynamics is constrained by consistency with the thermodynamics of quantum fields .",
    "but thermodynamics does _ not _ and _ can not _ give the full gravitational equations , as is clear for instance from the fact that gravitational theories different from general relativity are also compatible with the field thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "what is the physical meaning of the hadamard - like states introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : quantumgravity ] ?",
    "these quantum states determine all the relations necessary for jacobson s calculation .",
    "they are analogous to those obtained restricting the minkowsky vacuum to the rindler wedge . like those states ,",
    "they precisely describe the short scale correlations and the effect of local lorentz invariance and the positivity of the energy .",
    "formally , a pure state on the link that gives rise to the density matrix is simply built by having the source component of the state related to the target one by a lorentz transformation with imaginary parameter @xmath109 _ s = e^-j j,|_t . in turn , this form of the state is formally determined by requiring a global lorentz invariance and positivity of energy that allows for an analytic continuation @xcite .",
    "thus , these states can be viewed as implementing the local properties that render a semiclassical geometry locally lorentz invariant .",
    "if every link of a spin network carries the correlations of these states , then the corresponding quantum state has everywhere the short scale correlations of a conventional quantum field theory state .",
    "these are therefore the states that may build up the architecture of a classical spacetime geometry @xcite . in quantum field theory on curved spacetime attention",
    "is restricted to states having an appropriate short scale behavior , which is determined by it being the same as that of a flat lorentz invariant quantum field theory .",
    "states with this local property are called hadamard states .",
    "this is why , by analogy , we call the states of sec.[sec : quantumgravity ] hadamard states : they behave like quantum field states in the small .",
    "notice that the relation here is not at the infinitesimal level , but at the finite planck - scale , namely across each single link of a spin network .",
    "quantum gravity is a theory without infinities .",
    "jacobson s derivation of the einstein equations admits an interpretation different from the common one where it is assumed to indicate the existence of microscopic states for which the einstein equations would be an equation of state .",
    "the alternative interpretation is based on the identification of the relevant dynamics simply as the quantum version of einstein s dynamics .",
    "the relevant microscopic degrees of freedom are the quanta of the gravitational field . these are discrete at the planck scale , and this is the source of the finiteness of the entropy .",
    "the interaction of any system with the gravitational field in a region of spacetime is described by the field operators of the quantum theory . as for the electromagnetic field , some of the quantum states of the gravitational field have a semiclassical behavior .",
    "these appear as continuous geometries when probed at large scales : the mean value of the field operators determines the value of the geometrical observables .",
    "the approximation holds only in the semiclassical limit , namely at scales larger than the planck scale .",
    "these states present short scale correlations , like all the finite energy states of conventional quantum field theory .",
    "but these correlations do not involve modes of arbitrarily high frequency , because of the planck scale quantum discreteness .",
    "because of the universality of the gravitational coupling , and thanks to a mechanism that can be intuitively understood as explained in section [ eu ] , the entropy density measuring these correlations is universal .",
    "an external observer accelerating in the semiclassical geometry interacts only with observables on one side of its causal horizon and can therefore associate an entropy density to the horizon , which is finite and universal .",
    "the dynamics ties any change in the area with an energy flow , therefore , because of the universality , the change in the area is tied by the dynamics to a change in entropy , with a universal temperature @xmath27 . this temperature is determined by the entropy - energy relation and therefore , ultimately , simply by the local lorentz invariance and the positivity of the energy of the local states showing short scale correlations . in spite of the fact that the source of the entropy is entanglement , this temperature behaves as a true temperature because the density matrix is a kms state with respect to the flow that describes the evolution of an observer accelerating in the mean geometry , and because this observer interacts with a large number of degrees of freedom , all in this kms state .",
    "it follows from this that @xmath27 is detected by a thermometer moving with the observer .",
    "the relation between area and energy is determined by the quantum dynamics of general relativity : it is true both in the quantum and the classical theory . the universal relation between area and entropy",
    "is determined by the short scale structure of the semiclassical states , their local lorentz invariance and the positivity of the energy , as in the bisognano - wichmann theorem . in the deep ultraviolet",
    "this picture is confirmed by loop quantum gravity , where all the input formulas of jacobson s derivation can be recovered starting from the elementary quantum dynamics of the theory , for appropriate states that have semiclassical properties , which we have called hadamard states .",
    "the entropy in jacobson s calculation is therefore entanglement entropy across the horizon .",
    "it is a property of a pure state , when restricted to the sub algebra of observables lying on one side of the causal horizon .",
    "it is not related to any mysterious underlying degrees of freedom .",
    "the entropy balance relation does not imply statistical uncertainty and in general holds also for entanglement entropy .",
    "what jacobson has shown is ( i ) that the area - energy relation , combined with general covariance , determines the einstein equations , a result in line with similar previous derivations of the einstein equations from a single local equation , e.g. @xcite ; and ( ii ) that this dynamics not only implies the universality of the entropy / area ratio , but is also implied by it .",
    "this does not diminish the relevance of jacobson s result . to the contrary",
    ", it puts it in an even more interesting light .",
    "jacobson s remarkable discovery is not that there are mysterious microstates beyond the quantized gravitational field .",
    "it is that the dynamics of gravity and the einstein equations can be recovered from a simple relation between boost generator and area of its dual surface , and these quantities are related to the entanglement entropy in semiclassical states .",
    "this is a step ahead in unraveling the spectacular beauty and the simplicity of general relativity , not an indication of its limits .    ",

    "the amplitude for the thermometer to jump up from the initial state @xmath126 to the final state @xmath127 , while the system moves from an initial state @xmath128 to a final state @xmath129 can be computed using fermi s golden rule to first order in @xmath125 : @xmath130 the probability for the thermometer to jump up is the modulus square of the amplitude , summed over the final state .",
    "this is @xmath131 where we have used the algebraic notation @xmath132 .",
    "if the initial state is an equilibrium state @xmath133 and the integrand depends only on the difference of the times .",
    "the transition probability per unit time is then @xmath134 which shows that is precisely the quantity giving the transition rate for a thermometer coupled to the system .",

    "the structure defined by these equations is called a modular flow in the mathematical literature : @xmath116 is a modular flow , or a tomita flow , for the state @xmath138 , and is the basic tool for the classification of the @xmath139 algebras . in the physical literature , the state @xmath138",
    "is called a kms state ( for the time flow ) . in order to show that a system is in equilibrium and behaves thermally in a certain state , it is sufficient to show that the state satisfies these two equations . in order for a kms state to behave as an equilibrium state at some temperature ,",
    "however , the corresponding flow must be the evolution flow of the thermometer .",
    "therefore the claim here is not that any kms state , with respect to any flow , behaves as a thermal state .",
    "notice that in the context of hilbert space quantum mechanics , a state can satisfy these two equations also if it is a pure state .",
    "the standard example is provided by the vacuum state of a poincar invariant quantum field theory , which is kms with respect to the modular flow defined by the boost in a given direction .",
    "being poincar invariant , the vacuum is invariant under this flow , and a celebrated calculation by unruh shows that it is kms at inverse temperature @xmath140 .    in this case",
    ", the physical interpretation is simply given by the fact that an observer stationary with respect this flow , namely an accelerated observer at unit acceleration , will measure a temperature @xmath141 .",
    "unruh s original calculation , indeed , follows precisely the steps above in equations ( [ v]-[v22 ] ) .",
