    "[ intro ]    in the present paper , we apply the generalized alignment index ( gali ) method introduced by skokos et al ( 2007 ) @xcite to two types of dynamics , which are related to localization phenomena in multi  dimensional hamiltonian systems and symplectic maps .",
    "the first type refers to quasiperiodic oscillations in the vicinity of what is known as _",
    "discrete breathers _ , or exact periodic solutions of multi  dimensional systems , which are exponentially localized in real space . the second class of phenomena concerns localization in fourier space and is evidenced by the persistence of quasiperiodic recurrences in the neighborhood of normal mode oscillations of nonlinear lattices , observed for example in the famous numerical experiments performed by fermi pasta and ulam ( fpu ) in the early 1950 s @xcite .",
    "in section [ gali_def ] , we present a brief introduction to the gali method and in section [ db ] we use it to study quasiperiodic motion on tori of low dimensionality near a stable discrete breather of a hamiltonian lattice , with nonlinear on site potential and only quartic nearest neighbor interactions . then in section [ n_sm ] , we turn to a system of @xmath0 coupled standard maps and give evidence for the existence of both of the above types of localization : first starting with initial conditions localized in real space , we find low dimensional quasiperiodic motion , which persists for very long times",
    ". we also study in this discrete model recurrences of its ( linear ) normal mode oscillations and find that , in contrast with the fpu model , the tori associated with them are high  dimensional , which may be due to the fact that , unlike the fpu example , each map contains on site nonlinear terms , which depend on its individual variables .",
    "finally we discuss our conclusions in section [ concl ] .",
    "[ gali_def ]    let us consider the @xmath5dimensional phase space of a conservative dynamical system , which may be represented by a hamiltonian flow of @xmath0 degrees of freedom or a @xmath5dimensional system of coupled symplectic maps .",
    "in order to study whether an orbit is chaotic or not , we examine the asymptotic behavior of @xmath6 initially linearly independent deviations from this orbit , denoted by the vectors @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "thus , we follow the orbit , using hamilton s equations ( or the map equations ) of motion and solve in parallel the variational equations about this orbit to study the behavior of solutions located in its neighborhood .    the generalized alignment index of order",
    "@xmath6 is a generalization of the smaller alignment index ( sali ) introduced in @xcite and is defined as the norm of the wedge ( or exterior ) product of @xmath6 associated unit deviation vectors @xcite : @xmath9 representing _ the volume of the parallelepiped _ , whose edges are these @xmath6 vectors .",
    "we note that the hat ( @xmath10 ) over a vector denotes that it is of unit magnitude and that @xmath11 represents the continuous or discrete time .    in the case of a chaotic orbit ,",
    "all deviation vectors tend to become _ linearly dependent _ , aligning in the direction of the eigenvector corresponding to the maximal lyapunov exponent and gali@xmath12 tends exponentially to zero following the law @xcite : @xmath13t},\\vspace{-0.25cm}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 are approximations of the first @xmath6 largest lyapunov exponents of the dynamics . in the case of regular motion , on the other hand , all deviation vectors tend to fall on the @xmath0dimensional tangent space of the torus , where the motion is quasiperiodic . thus ,",
    "if we start with @xmath15 general deviation vectors , these will remain _ linearly independent _ on the @xmath0dimensional tangent space of the torus , since there is no particular reason for them to become aligned . as a consequence , gali@xmath12 in this case remains practically constant for @xmath15 . on the other hand , for @xmath16",
    ", gali@xmath12 tends to zero , since some deviation vectors will eventually become _ linearly dependent _ , following power laws that depend on the dimensionality of the torus . according to our asymptotic analysis of determinants entering in an expansion of ( [ gali:0 ] ) in a basis of eigenvectors following the motion , one obtains the following formula for the gali@xmath12 , associated with quasiperiodic orbits lying on @xmath17-dimensional tori @xcite : @xmath18 the computation of such determinants ,",
    "however , is hardly the most efficient way to compute the gali@xmath12 , especially in cases where the dimension of the system @xmath0 becomes large .",
    "for this reason , we have recently introduced and employed a method based on singular value decomposition to show that the gali@xmath12 can be very efficiently computed as the product of the singular values of a @xmath19 matrix @xcite .",
    "[ db ]    in this section we examine the dynamics in the vicinity of discrete breathers in a one  dimensional hamiltonian lattice with quartic on site potential and linear dispersion terms in its nearest neighbor particle interactions . for this purpose , we start with initial conditions near the exact breather and check whether the motion remains quasiperiodic or becomes chaotic . we accomplish this by computing the gali indices along the reference orbit . if the breather is stable , the gali method can be used to determine the dimensionality of the tori surrounding the breather in the @xmath5dimensional phase space .",
    "this dimension is generically @xmath0 and equals the number of frequencies that are being excited in the neighborhood of the exact breather . as for chaotic motion diffusing slowly away from these breathers",
    ", it is rapidly and efficiently predicted by the exponential convergence of all gali indices to zero .",

    ", one finds that the equations of motion can be exactly separated into a spatial and a time ",
    "dependent part each of which is equal to an arbitrary constant @xmath30 .",
    "thus , we arrive at a periodically driven duffing equation : @xmath31g =- cg^{3 } , \\label{duff}\\ ] ] satisfied by @xmath25 and a discrete map : @xmath32 which yields the spatial evolution of the system ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , we consider a lattice of @xmath33 particles , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the initial conditions of the driven duffing equation are chosen on an exact exact periodic orbit with @xmath36 , @xmath37 and frequency @xmath38 , if @xmath39 . furthermore",
    ", if the initial conditions lie on the _ homoclinic intersections _ of the invariant manifolds of the saddle point at the origin of the map , the solution becomes an exact breather with @xmath40 ( fig .",

    "our first goal , therefore , is to examine the motion near this breather by perturbing the initial conditions in its neighborhood and applying the gali indices to characterize the resulting orbits . in this study , we have made two kinds of perturbations : in the first case we change only the factor @xmath41 , while in the second both the factor @xmath41 and the spatial initial conditions of the map are varied .",

    "this implies that the motion is that of a quasiperiodic orbit that lies on a 2dimensional ( 2d ) torus .",
    "in fact , for initial conditions ( r2 ) : @xmath75=(0.5,0.0 ) , @xmath76 @xmath86 , perturbing two particles @xmath78 , @xmath87 for the same parameters as in the r1 experiment , we detected regular motion that lies on a 3d torus !",

    "as seen in the figure , the motion is indeed quasiperiodic and confined to the middle 3 maps , as all other degrees of freedom do not gain any significant amount of energy .",
    "similarly , we have observed that exciting 3 central particles ( @xmath93 ) gives a quasiperiodic motion on 4d tori .",
    "this is reminiscent of the motion near discrete breathers of hamiltonian systems and suggests that the excitation of each particle adds one extra frequency to the motion .    *",
    "b. initial conditions localized in fourier space *    finally , let us investigate the phenomenon of fpu recurrences in our system of coupled standard maps . to do this , we first need to derive the linear normal modes of the model , in order to choose initial conditions that will excite only a small number of them .",
    "thus , keeping only the first term in the taylor expansion of the @xmath94function in ( [ eq : csm ] ) , we obtain the following system of equations : @xmath95 where @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98,\\ ] ] with @xmath99 .    using now well  known methods of linear algebra , we diagonalize the matrix @xmath100 writing @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is an invertible matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath100 and @xmath103 is diagonal , @xmath104 $ ] , provided the eigenvalues @xmath105 are real and discrete .",

    "the evolution in the uncoupled coordinates is given by the transformation : @xmath125 where each pair of @xmath126 corresponds to a normal mode of the system . since the map is area  preserving @xmath127 and we may define the quantity @xmath128 as the energy of each mode , which is preserved under the evolution of the linear map , i.e. @xmath129 .    thus , to study recurrences , we start with the example of @xmath130 coupled standard maps , choose a ` small ' coupling parameter @xmath131 and excite 5 different modes . as a result , we are able to detect a quasiperiodic orbit that lies on a 5d torus , indicated by all the gali@xmath82 , @xmath132 , approaching a constant , as shown in fig . [ 10d_sm_5d_torus_modes ] .",
    "this is verified in fig .",

    "exciting now only _ one normal mode _ ( the 21@xmath134 ) , much like the original fpu case , we calculate the galis again and find that the orbit is again quasiperiodic , lying on a 6dimensional torus , as evidenced by the fact that gali@xmath82 for @xmath135 fluctuate around non ",

    "this is , of course , a low  dimensional torus , since generically one expects regular orbits of this system to lie on @xmath74dimensional tori ! from the calculation of the normal mode energies in this experiment , we observe that the initial energy is now shared by 6 modes and executes recurrences , for as long as we have integrated the equations of motion .",
    "the energies of these 6 modes are not shown here since their values are too close to each other to be distinguished in a graphical representation .    finally ,",
    "as our last experiment , we increase the coupling parameter to @xmath136 , for the same choice of initial conditions and @xmath137 values as in fig .",
    "[ 20_sm_6d_torus_chaos]a .",
    "the result is that the influence of the coupling is now quite strong and leads to the breakdown of recurrences and the onset of chaotic behavior .",

    "[ concl ]    localized oscillations in one  dimensional nonlinear hamiltonian lattices constitute , for the last 15 years , one of the most active areas of research in mathematical physics . of primary interest has been the discovery of certain exact periodic solutions in such lattices , called discrete breathers , which are exponentially localized _ in real space_. it is known that when these solutions are stable , there are regions around them in phase space , where orbits oscillate quasiperiodically for very long times , even though the presence of linear dispersion is expected to lead them to delocalization away from the discrete breather .",
    "how long do they stay , however , in that vicinity and what is the dimensionality of the tori on which they lie ?",
    "furthermore , how large are these regular regions and at what initial conditions ( or parameter values ) does chaotic behavior begin to arise ?",
    "similar questions can also be posed about another form of localization _ in fourier space _ , which has been very recently proposed as an explanation of the famous recurrence phenomena known to characterize the dynamics near linear normal modes of nonlinear lattices , since the early 1950s .",
    "clearly , the interest in such localization lies in the ( in)ability of hamiltonian lattices to exhibit energy propagation and equipartition as expected from the theory of statistical mechanics .    to answer such questions ,",
    "we have applied in this paper a new method that our group has recently developed , which is able to distinguish order from chaos , identify the dimensionality of tori and predict slow diffusion in thin chaotic layers , faster and more reliably than other methods ( see also our recent publication @xcite ) .",
    "this is accomplished by computing what we call the _ gali indices _ of the orbits under study , for which we have obtained analytical formulas that are in excellent agreement with our numerical calculations .",
    "we have thus considered two examples of high dimensional systems : one hamiltonian lattice described by 31 newton s second order differential equations and one system of 20 coupled area  preserving pairs of difference equations mapping the plane onto itself . in each of these models , we have been able to demonstrate the usefulness of the gali indices in analyzing the properties of regular motion localized in real and fourier space .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that our indices can accurately determine cases where the motion becomes delocalized and starts to diffuse chaotically in phase space , long before this is observed in the actual oscillations .",
    "we wish to emphasize the superiority of our approach to the traditional calculation of _ lyapunov exponents _ , still used by many researchers to distinguish regular from chaotic motion .",
    "as we have shown , lyapunov exponents can be misleading , as they often tend to decrease in time giving the impression that the motion is quasiperiodic , while it is in fact weakly chaotic .",
    "the gali indices , on the other hand , are computationally more efficient , as they concentrate on the _ tangent space _ of the dynamics and explore the _ linear ( in)dependence _ of @xmath6 unit deviation vectors about an orbit representing the volume of their associated parallelepiped . if , for @xmath138 , that volume remains constant and decays for @xmath139 by well  defined power laws , the motion is quasiperiodic on a @xmath140dimensional torus , while if the volume decreases exponentially for all @xmath6 the motion is chaotic .",
    "we , therefore , hope that the virtues of the gali method emphasized in this paper , will encourage researchers studying the dynamics of multi  dimensional conservative systems to use them in order to study many other physically interesting applications .",
