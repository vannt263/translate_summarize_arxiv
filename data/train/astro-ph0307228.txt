    "the death of massive stars and the processes that lead to the formation of the compact remnants is a forefront area in stellar astrophysics .",
    "recent advances in modeling suggest that great diversity can be expected .",
    "indeed , observationally we have already witnessed a large diversity in the neutron star remnants : radio pulsars , axps , sgrs , and the central source in casa .",
    "we know relatively little about the formation of black holes , static or rotating .    the compact object form following the collapse of the progenitor core . the energy of the resulting explosion could be supplemented or even dominated by the energy released from the compact object ( e.g.  a rapidly rotating magnetar or an accreting black hole ) .",
    "such `` engines '' can give rise to asymmetrical explosions @xcite .",
    "regardless of the source of energy , a fraction of the total energy , @xmath2 , is coupled to the debris or ejecta ( mass @xmath3 ) and it is these two gross parameters which determine the appearance and evolution of the resulting explosion .",
    "equivalently one may consider @xmath2 and the mean initial speed of ejecta , @xmath4 , or the lorentz factor , @xmath5^{-1/2}$ ] , where @xmath6 .",
    "supernovae ( sne ) and @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) , are distinguished by their ejecta velocities . in the former @xmath7 km s@xmath8",
    "as inferred from optical absorption features ( e.g.  @xcite ) , while for the latter @xmath9 , inferred from the non - thermal prompt emission @xcite , respectively . the large difference in initial velocity arises from significantly different ejecta masses : @xmath10 m@xmath11 in sne compared to @xmath12 m@xmath11 in grbs .    in the conventional interpretation ,",
    "@xmath3 for sne is large because @xmath2 is primarily derived from the ( essentially ) symmetrical collapse of the core and the energy thus couples to all the mass left after the formation of the compact object .",
    "mysteriously , @xmath2 clusters around 1 foe ( foe is @xmath13 erg ) in most sne , a mere @xmath14 of the energy released in the gravitational collapse of the core .    whereas the initial ejecta speed is solely determined by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , a fraction of the ejecta is accelerated to higher velocities as the blast wave races down the density gradient of the stellar enveloped ( e.g.  @xcite ) . for the wind- or binary - stripped",
    "( e.g.  @xcite ) helium and carbon progenitors of type ib and ic sne , both factors ( a smaller core mass and a steep density gradient ) conspire to produce ejecta at velocities as high as @xmath15 .",
    "however , only @xmath16 is carried by these ejecta @xcite .",
    "in contrast , high velocity ejecta is neither expected nor observed in type ii sne with their massive stellar envelopes .",
    "grb models , on the other hand , appeal to a stellar mass black hole remnant , which accretes matter on many dynamical timescales and powers relativistic jets ( the so - called collapsar model ; @xcite ) ; highly magnetized neutron stars have also been proposed ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "observationally , this model is supported by the association of some grbs with sn explosions ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in addition , the complex temporal profiles and long duration of grbs are interpreted in terms of an engine that is relatively long lived ( i.e.  not a singular explosion ) .",
    "the high lorentz factors , a high degree of collimation with opening angles of a few degrees @xcite , and episodes of energy addition presumably from shells of ejecta with varying lorentz factors , further distinguish grbs from type ib / c sne .",
    "we now recognize that engine - driven events  grbs and the recently discovered x - ray flashes @xcite  in fact have a wide dispersion in their ultra - relativistic output as manifested by their beaming - corrected @xmath0-ray energies @xcite and x - ray luminosities @xcite .",
    "however , these cosmological explosions appear to have a nearly constant total explosive yield when taking into account the energy in mildly relativistic ejecta @xcite .",
    "the unusual and nearby ( @xmath17 mpc ) sn1998bw shares some of the unique attributes expected of grbs .",
    "this type ic sn was found to be coincident in time and position with grb980425 @xcite , an event with a single smooth profile .",
    "the inferred isotropic energy in @xmath0-rays of grb980425 was only @xmath18 erg @xcite , three to six orders of magnitude fainter than typical grbs .",
    "more importantly , sn1998bw exhibited unusually bright radio emission indicating about @xmath19 erg of mildly relativistic ejecta @xcite .",
    "equally significant , the radio emission indicated a clear episode of energy addition @xcite .",
    "none of these features ",
    "@xmath0-rays , significant energy with @xmath20 , and episodes of energy addition  have been seen in any other nearby sn .",
    "thus , the empirical data strongly favor an engine origin for sn1998bw . in the optical",
    ", sn1998bw also appears to be extreme : velocity widths approaching 60,000 km s@xmath8 were seen at early time @xcite and the inferred explosion energy may be above normal values , with estimates ranging from 2 to 50 foe @xcite .",
    "the inference of an engine in sn1998bw raises two scenarios for its origin and relation to grbs .",
    "grb980425 may have been a typical burst but viewed well away from the jet axis ( hereafter , the off - axis model ) , thereby resulting in apparently weak @xmath0-ray emission despite the great proximity .",
    "alternatively , sn1998bw represents a different class of sne .",
    "if so , collapsars can produce very diverse explosions .",
    "a powerful discriminant between these two scenarios is the expected rate of sn1998bw - like events . in the off - axis model , the fraction of type ib / c sne that are powered by a central engine",
    "is linked to the mean beaming factor of grbs ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite presented the distribution of jet opening angles for a sample of 15 grbs , and found that the mean beaming factor is @xmath21 ; here @xmath22 $ ] is the beaming fraction , and @xmath23 is the collimation angle . with an estimated local grb rate of @xmath24 gpc@xmath25 yr@xmath8 @xcite",
    "compared to a type ib / c sn rate of @xmath26 gpc@xmath25 yr@xmath8 @xcite , we expect that @xmath27 of type ib / c sne will be similar to sn1998bw .",
    "on the other hand , if sn1998bw is not an off - axis cosmological burst , then the rate of similar events has to be assessed independent of the grb rate .",
    "an upper limit can be obtained by assuming that all type ib / c sne are engine driven highly asymmetric explosions with sn1998bw having the most favorable geometry . in this context , @xcite has argued that of the @xmath28 long - duration batse bursts , about 90 events possess similar high - energy attributes as that of grb980425 .",
    "this sub - sample may be concentrated along the super - galactic plane . if this sub - sample is accepted as distinct from the cosmological bursts then @xmath29 of type ib / c sne within 100 mpc",
    "are expected to be events like sn1998bw .    here , we report a comprehensive program of radio observations of nearby type ib / c sne .",
    "we began this program in 1999 ( motivated by sn1998bw ) and observed most reported type ib / c sne with the very large array .",
    "our basic hypothesis is that ( mildly ) relativistic ejecta are best probed by radio observations , as was demonstrated in the case of sn1998bw . furthermore , radio observations of type ib / c sne allow us to directly compare these objects to the radio afterglows of cosmological grbs .",
    "thus , we can empirically ( direct comparison of radio luminosity distributions ) and quantitatively ( calorimetry via radio observations ) investigate the link , or lack thereof between type ib / c sne and cosmological grbs .",
    "as alluded to above , we did not investigate type ii sne since the extended envelopes and dense circumstellar media of their progenitors are reasonably expected to mask the activity of a putative engine and thus suppress the presence of mildly relativistic ejecta to which we are most sensitive .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in  [ sec : obs ] we present the details of the observations .",
    "the results are summarized in ",
    "[ sec : stat ] , where we investigate the broad radio properties (  [ sec : lums ] ) , expansion velocities (  [ sec : vels ] ) , and energies in high velocity ejecta (  [ sec : energy ] ) .",
    "we further provide a comparison to the radio afterglows of grbs in  [ sec : comp ] and draw conclusions in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "table  [ tab : data ] summarizes the very large array ( vla ) observations of type ib / c sne starting in late 1999 and up to the end of 2002 . we observed a total of 33 sne out of 51 identified spectroscopically during the same period .",
    "the observed targets were determined solely by the availability of observing time and optical selection criteria ; we did not employ any additional selection criteria .    in all observations we used the standard continuum mode with @xmath30 mhz bands , centered on 1.43 , 4.86 , or 8.46 ghz .",
    "we used the sources 3c48 ( j0137 + 331 ) , 3c147 ( j0542 + 498 ) , and 3c286",
    "( j1331 + 305 ) for flux calibration , and calibrator sources within @xmath31 of the sne to monitor the phase .",
    "the data were reduced and analyzed using the astronomical image processing system @xcite .",
    "in this section we investigate the ejecta properties and diversity of the sample .",
    "results for individual sne are given in the appendix . in figure",
    "[ fig : lcs ] we plot the radio luminosities and upper limits for type ib / c sne observed in this survey and in the past ( sn1983n : @xcite ; sn1984l : @xcite ; sn1990b : @xcite ; sn1998bw : @xcite ; sn2002ap : @xcite ) . the typical delay between the sn explosion and time of our observations is about 20 days , with four sne observed with a delay of over @xmath32 days .",
    "in addition , three of the sne are embedded in host galaxies with strong radio emission . for these cases ,",
    "we adopt upper limits that correspond to the brightness of the galaxy ( at least ten times the root - mean - square noise of the individual image ) .",
    "four of the thirty three sne have been detected .",
    "thus the detection rate of our experiment with a typical flux density limit of 0.15mjy ( @xmath33 ) is about @xmath34 .",
    "figure  [ fig : lcs ] provides a succinct summary of the radio light curves of the type ib / c sne .",
    "two strong conclusions can be immediately drawn from this figure .",
    "first , sne as bright as sn1998bw are rare .",
    "second , there is significant dispersion in the luminosities of type ib / c sne , ranging from @xmath35 erg s@xmath8 hz@xmath8 at the bright end ( sn1998bw ) to that of sn2002ap which is fainter by about four orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "it is curious that sn2002ap also happens to be the nearest ib / c sn in our sample ( table  [ tab : data ] ) .",
    "six of the eight type ib / c sne detected in the radio to date cluster in the range of about @xmath36 erg s@xmath8 hz@xmath8 .",
    "this may be partly due to a selection effect since the typical detection threshold is about @xmath37 erg s@xmath8 hz@xmath8 .",
    "we also find that 28 of the 29 non - detections are no brighter than 0.1 times the luminosity of sn1998bw .",
    "sn2002cg appears potentially brighter than sn1998bw only because it is embedded in a radio bright host galaxy ; we are therefore forced to use a @xmath38 limit on its luminosity ( table  [ tab : data ] ) .",
    "thus , the incidence of bright events like sn1998bw is @xmath1 .    as with the radio luminosities , the peak times also exhibit great variation : at 1.4 ghz the emission from sn2002ap peaked at about 7 days , while for sn2002cj it peaked at about 65 days .",
    "for sn1998bw the initial peak occurred at 15 days , followed by a second peak at about 40 days . similarly , at 8.5 ghz , sn1998bw peaked at 12 and 30 days past explosion , sn1983n peaked at about 30 days , and sn2002ap is predicted to have peaked at @xmath39 days ( the first observation at this frequency was taken about 4 days after the sn explosion ) .",
    "if the radio emission arises from a synchrotron spectrum peaking at the self - absorption frequency , @xmath40 , then the peak time and peak luminosity directly measure the mean expansion speed @xcite .",
    "this is simply because the self - absorption frequency is sensitive to the size of the source , while the luminosity is sensitive to the swept - up mass .",
    "we use equation 16 of @xcite to evaluate the average expansion velocities : @xmath41 here , @xmath42 erg s@xmath8 hz@xmath8 is the peak luminosity , @xmath43 days is the time of peak emission relative to the sn explosion , and @xmath44 ghz is the peak frequency . we infer velocities ranging from @xmath45 to @xmath46 km s@xmath8 ( figure  [ fig : vel ] ) . again , as with the luminosities , sn1998bw with @xmath47 is an exception .",
    "we note that if free - free absorption plays a significant role , then @xmath48 is only an upper limit to @xmath40 , and @xmath49 is a lower limit to the intrinsic peak luminosity . in this case",
    ", the inferred values of @xmath50 listed above will in fact be a lower limit to the actual expansion velocity .",
    "however , this is probably not significant for type ib / c sne since their compact progenitors have high escape velocities and therefore fast winds and low circumburst densities . indeed , there is no evidence for free - free absorption either for sn1998bw @xcite or sn 2002ap @xcite .    estimating the expansion velocities for the non - detections is not straightforward since we can",
    "not ensure that the limits constrain the peak luminosity .",
    "we are therefore forced to make an additional assumption .",
    "for example , if we assume that most type ib / c sne are similar in their emission properties to sn1983n , then the majority of upper limits approximately sample the peak emission and the inferred upper limits are @xmath51 ( figure  [ fig : vel ] ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the typical peak time is only a few days then our observations only constrain the decaying portion of the lightcurve and the expansion velocity may be higher . fortunately , this is not a significant problem based on the following argument .",
    "the equipartition energy directly depends on the peak luminosity , @xmath52 erg ( see  [ sec:2002cj ] ) , where @xmath53 erg s@xmath8 is the peak luminosity at 8.5 ghz . with a typical fading rate of @xmath54 in the optically thin regime , there are a few sne that could have reached a peak luminosity of the order of @xmath55 erg s@xmath8 if @xmath56 day post explosion .",
    "this is a reasonable minimum peak time taking into account the deceleration time of the ejecta .",
    "thus , the equipartition energy is at most @xmath57 erg , about two orders of magnitude lower than typical grbs (  [ sec : conc ] ) . for most non - detections",
    "the limit is in fact much lower , @xmath58 to @xmath59 erg .",
    "this indicates that a few of the non - detected sources may have in fact produced mildly relativistic ejecta , but these would still be energetically uninteresting when compared to sn1998bw let alone grb afterglows .      in the previous section we found that no sn observed to date is comparable to sn1998bw especially in regard to the mean expansion speed .",
    "sn1998bw was also interesting because it possessed an unusually large amount of energy in mildly relativistic ejecta .",
    "however , a purely hydrodynamic explosions can also produce _ some _ amount of relativistic ejecta .",
    "the energy of such ejecta can be estimated using well understood models of shock propagation in the pre - supernova cores @xcite .",
    "the key parameters are @xmath2 and @xmath3 which can be inferred from the optical lightcurves and spectra using hydrodynamic models of a sn explosion in a co core coupled with radiative transfer calculations ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    in this section",
    ", we investigate whether any of the detected type ib / c sne possess such large energy in high velocity ejecta that can not be explained by the simplest hypothesis of a purely hydrodynamic explosion . to this end , in table  [ tab : ejecta ] we summarize the results of hydrodynamic models for the sne that have been detected in the radio .    the ejecta produced in a hydrodynamic explosion has a density profile that can be described by power laws at low and high velocities , separated by a break velocity , which for type ib / c progenitors is given by @xcite : @xmath60 here @xmath61 erg and @xmath62 m@xmath11 . for typical values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the radio emission from the detected sne",
    "is produced by ejecta above the break velocity .",
    "in particular , for sn2002ap , @xmath63 km s@xmath8 , which is lower than the velocity of the ejecta producing the radio emission , @xmath64 km s@xmath8 @xcite . similarly , for sn1998bw @xmath65 ranges from about @xmath66 to @xmath67 km s@xmath8 ( depending on which model is assumed , table  [ tab : ejecta ] ) while the radio emission was produced by ejecta expanding with @xmath68 .",
    "the ejecta velocity profile extends up to a cutoff determined by significant radiative losses when the shock front breaks out of the star . for a radiative stellar envelope",
    "this is @xmath69 @xcite , assuming a stellar radius of 1 r@xmath11 . for the sne considered here we find cutoff velocities of @xmath70 .    to determine whether there is sufficient energy in fast ejecta to account for the radio observations we calculate the energy above a velocity , @xmath71 @xcite : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the velocity in units of @xmath46 km s@xmath8 .",
    "unfortunately , as can be seen from table  [ tab : ejecta ] , only four ( including sn1998bw ) sne have sufficient optical data which is necessary to estimate @xmath2 and @xmath3 . of this limited sample ,",
    "much of the radio data for sn1994i remain unpublished .",
    "thus we are left with sn2002ap , sn1983n , and sn1998bw .",
    "using the parameters given in table  [ tab : ejecta ] for sn2002ap , @xcite find @xmath74 erg .",
    "in contrast , from the radio observations we estimate @xmath75 erg . thus , there is no need , nor indeed room , for mildly relativistic ejecta in this sn .",
    "we therefore disagree with the claims of high velocity jets carrying a large amount of energy , @xmath76 foe , made by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the large discrepancy between the amount of energy inferred from the hydrodynamic models and the radio observations suggests that either the optically - derived parameters are in error , equation  [ eqn : energy ] has an incorrect pre - factor , or the radio estimate is incorrect .",
    "however , the radio estimate is relatively robust ( eventually related to equipartition energy estimates ) . on the other hand , as with sn1998be @xcite the total kinetic energy may have been over - estimated , possibly as a result of neglecting a mild asymmetry .",
    "for sn1984l we do not have a direct estimate of the energy in the radio - emitting ejecta since the peak of the radio emission has been missed .",
    "however , based on the similarity to sn1983n in the optically thin regime we estimate @xmath77 erg s@xmath8 hz@xmath8 .",
    "this translates to a peak flux of @xmath78 mjy at the distance of sn1984l ( @xmath79 mpc ) . using the equipartition analysis presented in  [ sec:2002cj ]",
    "we estimate an energy of about @xmath80 erg , and an average expansion velocity of about @xmath81 . from equation  [ eqn : energy ]",
    "we find @xmath82 erg  similar to the conundrum discussed above for sn2002ap .    for sn1998bw ,",
    "on the other hand , we find @xmath83 erg using the parameters inferred by @xcite , or @xmath84 erg using the parameters given by @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the energy available in fast ejecta is significantly lower than the energy inferred from the radio emission , @xmath85 erg .    to conclude , for sn1984l and sn2002ap a hydrodynamic explosion can supply the energy and velocity that are responsible for the observed radio emission .",
    "most likely , the same is true for the non - detections .",
    "on the other hand , sn1998bw is a clear exception , exhibiting a significant excess of energy in ejecta moving with @xmath86 compared to what is available from a hydrodynamic explosion .",
    "in the previous section we investigated the radio properties of type ib / c sne and found that in every respect sn1998bw was unique . in this section we compare the ib / c sample ( including sn1998bw ) with the radio afterglows of grbs . in figure  [ fig : lcs2 ] we plot the radio lightcurves of grb970508 @xcite , a typical cosmological burst , and the nearest event , grb 030329 @xcite , in addition to the sn lightcurves .",
    "as demonstrated by this figure and figure  [ fig : hist1 ] , the radio lightcurves of grb afterglows and sne are dramatically different . furthermore , sn 1998bw is unique in both samples : it is fainter than typical radio afterglows of grbs but much brighter than type ib / c sne",
    ".    figures  [ fig : lcs2 ] and [ fig : hist1 ] have significant implications , namely _ none _ of the type ib / c sne presented here could have given rise to a typical @xmath0-ray burst .",
    "it has been suggested that grbs are distant type ib / c sne but with their jets pointed at the observer , whereas such a bias is absent in the nearby type ib / c sample .",
    "however , most of our radio observations are obtained on a timescale of 10100 days ( see figure  [ fig : lcs ] ) . scaling from the observed `` jet '' break times of a few days in grb afterglows , off - axis collimated explosions become spherical on a timescale of @xmath87 days @xcite at which point the relative geometry between",
    "the observer and the explosion is not important .",
    "thus , we find no evidence suggesting that all or even a reasonable majority of type ib / c sne give rise to grbs .",
    "we now quantify the difference between the ib / c and grb samples .",
    "our goal here is to determine the differential luminosity distribution , @xmath88 , which agrees with both detections and upper limits ; here @xmath88 is the number of events with luminosity between @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "it is important to include non - detections since they represent the majority of the sn data .",
    "similarly , we include upper limits on the radio luminosity of grb afterglows that have been localized in other wave - bands ( i.e.  optical and x - rays ) and for which a redshift has been measured .",
    "unfortunately , as many as half of the grbs localized in the x - rays do not have a precise position , and hence a redshift .",
    "for these afterglows it is not possible to provide a limit on the radio luminosity .",
    "still , with a typical flux limit of about 0.3 mjy ( @xmath91 ; @xcite ) , and assuming that these sources have a similar distribution of redshifts to the detected afterglows , we find typical luminosity limits of about @xmath92 erg s@xmath8 hz@xmath8 , consistent with the peak of the distribution of detected afterglows . therefore , unless these sources are biased to low redshift we do not expect a strong bias as a result of neglecting them .",
    "the quality of fit for @xmath88 is determined using the likelihood function , @xmath93 , with @xcite : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the total number of sources ( sne or afterglows ) , and @xmath96 is a normalized gaussian profile centered on the observed luminosity of a detected source and with a width equal to the @xmath97 rms uncertainty in the luminosity .",
    "we consider four models for @xmath88 based on the apparent distribution of the detections and upper limits : a gaussian , @xmath98 } ,   \\label{eqn : gauss}\\ ] ] a decreasing power - law , @xmath99 an increasing power - law , @xmath100 and a flat distribution , @xmath101 in each case we fit for the two free parameters ( e.g.  @xmath102 and @xmath103 in equation  [ eqn : gauss ] ) .",
    "we do not use the increasing power law model for the individual distributions since the observations are clearly inconsistent with such a model .",
    "the resulting best - fit models are shown in figure  [ fig : hist2 ] and summarized in table  [ tab : bayes ] .",
    "we find that the sn population is modeled equally well with the gaussian , flat , or decreasing power law distributions , while the grb afterglows can be fit with a gaussian or flat distributions ; a decreasing power law provides a much poorer fit .",
    "regardless of the exact distribution the two populations require distinctly different parameters , with a minimal overlap at the tails of the distributions .",
    "fitting the combined sn and afterglow data with the models provided above ( figure  [ fig : hist2 ] and table  [ tab : bayes ] ) we find that even the best models ( an increasing power - law or a flat distribution ) provide a much poorer fit ; the likelihood of the fits are @xmath104 compared to the combined value of @xmath105 for the separate gaussian fits .",
    "thus , the two populations can not be accommodated with a simple single distribution .",
    "this points to a separate origin for the grb and type ib / c sn populations .",
    "however , sn1998bw can be accommodated in either population .",
    "it is equally plausibe that it is a low luminosity grb or the brightest type ib / c radio supernova known to date .",
    "we presented vla radio observations of 33 type ib / c sne observed between late 1999 and the end of 2002 .",
    "four of these sne have been detected , giving a detection rate of about @xmath34 above a typical @xmath33 flux limit of 0.15 mjy . at the same time , the combined detections and non - detections indicate that at most @xmath106 of type ib / c sne are as luminous as sn1998bw , although the single source which may be brighter is only so because it is embedded in a radio bright host galaxy .",
    "we infer typical velocities of the radio - emitting ejecta of about @xmath107 km s@xmath8 for the detected sne , and upper limits in the same range for the non - detections .",
    "we also find that a hydrodynamic explosion can supply the energy carried by the fastest ejecta . finally ,",
    "none of the detected sne show clear evidence for variable energy input ( shells with different velocity or continued activity by the central engine ) ; however , we note that our sampling is quite sparse .",
    "the measurements ( radio lightcurves ) and inferences ( energy in fast ejecta , energy addition ) offer no compelling reason to conclude that any of our sne have the special properties of sn1998bw (  [ sec : bw ] ) .",
    "@xcite has proposed , based on the empirical lag - luminosity relation , that 25% of type ib / c sne are similar to sn1998bw .",
    "we also compared the type ib / c sample with the sample of radio afterglow of grbs .",
    "empirically , these two populations appear to be quite disparate .",
    "this conclusion is reinforced by careful modeling of the luminosity distributions .",
    "still , sn1998bw may belong to either population .",
    "our four year survey of type ib / c sne was first and foremost motivated by the peculiar object , sn1998bw .",
    "this supernova showed three attributes unique to grbs : relativistic ejecta , substantial reservoir of energy in such ejecta , and energy addition . a singular hydrodynamic explosion can not account for these attributes .",
    "a natural explanation is that sn1998bw , like grbs , was , driven by an engine powerful enough to significantly modify the explosion .",
    "our survey has demonstrated that sn1998bw - like events are rare in the local sample .",
    "this begs the question : what is sn1998bw ?",
    "two popular scenarios have been suggested .",
    "the first  the `` off - axis '' scenario  holds that sn1998bw is a typical grb albeit nearby and with collimated ejecta pointed away from us @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis is attractive because of its simplicity .",
    "we know grbs exist and most of them do not point towards us @xcite",
    ".    in the other scenario sn1998bw is a new type of explosion with little energy in ultra - relativistic ejecta @xcite .",
    "evidence in favor of this idea is best illustrated by figure  [ fig : hist3 ] where we find that grb980425 is consistently at the faint end of the grb population .",
    "unfortunately , we are not able to decisively resolve this controversy .",
    "as demonstrated by figure  [ fig : hist1 ] , one could argue that sn1998bw is at the bright end of the radio luminosity function of type ib / c supernovae or at the faint end of grb radio afterglow .",
    "the expected rate of sn1998bw - like events in the off - axis framework is about @xmath108 of type ib / c events , given the average beaming factor of about @xmath109 derived by @xcite .",
    "thus , it is not entirely improbable that one out of about 40 type ib / c sne observed to date is an off - axis grb . as an aside",
    ", we can use our @xmath106 limit and compare the event rate of type ib / c sne with the observed rate of grbs (  [ sec : intro ] ) to place a limit of @xmath110 on the beaming fraction .",
    "this corresponds to a limit of @xmath111 on the jet opening angles of grbs ; narrower jets are not likely .",
    "this result may also be interpreted as a limit on angular size of the highly relativistic core in models of variable energy and/or lorentz factor across the surface of the jet @xcite .    in the gsn framework , we now know that at most a few percent of type ib / c are possibly gsne . at the same time , the recent grb030329 was accompanied by a sn similar to sn1998bw ( sn2003dh ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , an investigation of the number and properties of gsne requires observations of both local type ib / c sne and grbs .    while we can not determine the exact origin of sn1998bw based on the statistics of our survey ,",
    "the ultimate detection of similar events at the level of about @xmath14 may in fact allow us to distinguish between the off - axis and gsn scenarios .",
    "the discovery of broad optical lines in sn1998bw and large explosive energy release , @xmath112 foe , prompted some astronomers to use the designation `` hypernovae '' for sn1998bw - like sne .",
    "unfortunately , this designation is not well defined . to begin with",
    ", the term hypernova was first used by @xcite to describe the grb / afterglow phenomenon ; thus , this term implies a connection to grbs .",
    "the prevalent view now is that hypernovae are characterized by broad optical absorption lines and larger than normal energy release .",
    "however , neither of these criteria has been defined quantitatively by their proponents .    ignoring this important issue ,",
    "the following have been suggested to be hypernovae : the type ib / c sne 1992ar @xcite , 1997dq @xcite , 1997ef @xcite , 1998ey @xcite , and 2002ap @xcite , and the type ii sne 1992am @xcite , 1997cy ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and 1999e @xcite . some have also been claimed to be associated with grbs detected by batse , but at a low significance .",
    "our view is that the critical distinction between an ordinary supernova and a grb explosion are relativistic ejecta carrying a considerable amount of energy .",
    "such ejecta are simply not traced by optical spectroscopy .",
    "this reasoning is best supported by the fact that the energy carried by the fast ejecta in sn1998bw and sn2002ap @xcite differ by four orders of magnitude even though both exhibit broad spectral features at early times .",
    "thus , broad lines do not appear to be a good surrogate for sn1998bw - like objects .",
    "in addition , in two cases , sne 2002ap and 1984l , the energy inferred from the radio observations indicates that the total kinetic energy as inferred by optical spectroscopy and light curves may have been over - estimated by an order of magnitude (  [ sec : energy ] ) .",
    "it is possible that `` hypernovae '' are in fact only slightly more energetic than typical type ib / c sne , but exhibit a mild degree of asymmetry , leading to excessively high estimates of the total energy when a spherical explosion is assumed .",
    "we suggest that the term hypernova be reserved for those sne , like sn1998bw , which show direct evidence for an engine through the presence of relativistic ejecta . as illustrated by sn1998bw , the relativistic ejecta",
    "are reliably traced by radio observations .",
    "we end with the following conclusions .",
    "first , radio observations provide a robust way of measuring the quantity of energy associated with high velocity ejecta .",
    "this allows us to clearly discriminate between engine - driven sne such as sn1998bw and ordinary sne , powered by a hydrodynamic explosion , such as sn2002ap @xcite and sne 2001b , 2001ci , and 2002cj presented here .",
    "second , since at least @xmath113 of local type ib / c sne are not powered by inner engines and furthermore have a total explosive yield of only @xmath59 erg in fast ejecta ( where fast means @xmath114 compared to @xmath115 in grbs ) , there is a clear dichotomy between type ib / c sne and cosmic , engine - driven explosions ( figure  [ fig : hist3 ] ) .",
    "the existence of intermediate classes of explosions and the nature of sn1998bw may be ascertained with continued monitoring of several hundred type ib / c sne and cosmological explosions .",
    "fortunately , such samples will likely become available over the next few years .",
    "we thank b.  schmidt for helpful comments .",
