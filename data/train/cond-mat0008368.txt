    "the spectacular demonstration of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in gases of alkali atoms @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 confined in magnetic traps@xcite has led to an explosion of interest in confined bose systems .",
    "of interest is the fraction of condensed atoms , the nature of the condensate , the excitations above the condensate , the atomic density in the trap as a function of temperature and the critical temperature of bec , @xmath3 .",
    "the extensive progress made up to early 1999 is reviewed by dalfovo et al.@xcite .",
    "a key feature of the trapped alkali and atomic hydrogen systems is that they are dilute .",
    "the characteristic dimensions of a typical trap for @xmath0 is @xmath4   ( ref .",
    "the interaction between @xmath0 atoms can be well represented by its s - wave scattering length , @xmath5 .",
    "this scattering length lies in the range @xmath6 where @xmath7   is the bohr radius @xcite .",
    "the definite value @xmath8 is usually selected and for calculations the definite ratio of atom size to trap size @xmath9 is usually chosen @xcite .",
    "a typical @xmath0 atom density in the trap is @xmath10 atoms/@xmath11 giving an inter - atom spacing @xmath12  .",
    "thus the effective atom size is small compared to both the trap size and the inter - atom spacing , the condition for diluteness ( i.e. , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number density ) . in this limit , although the interaction is important , dilute gas approximations such as the bogoliubov theory@xcite , valid for small @xmath15 and large condensate fraction @xmath16 , describe the system well .",
    "also , since most of the atoms are in the condensate ( except near @xmath3 ) , the gross - pitaevskii equation@xcite for the condensate describes the whole gas well .",
    "effects of atoms excited above the condensate have been incorporated within the popov approximation@xcite .",
    "one of the chief purposes of this paper is to go beyond the dilute limit , to test the limits of these approximations and to explore the properties of the trapped bose gas as @xmath15 increases between the dilute limit and the dense limit .",
    "we use variational monte carlo ( vmc ) methods .",
    "we increase the density by increasing both @xmath17 and the s- wave scattering length up to the value @xmath18 which describes liquid @xmath19he at svp when the @xmath19he atoms are represented by hard spheres of diameter @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the mean - field theories noted above , the trapped bose gas at finite temperatures has been investigated using path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) methods .",
    "krauth@xcite simulated 10,000 atoms in a spherical trap with ratio of scattering length @xmath21 to trap length given by @xmath22 noted above .",
    "he showed that the critical temperature @xmath3 is lowered compared to the ideal bose gas as a result of interaction .",
    "@xmath3 is lower because the repulsion between the atoms spreads the atoms in the trap and lowers the density compared to the non- interacting case .",
    "the same result has been obtained in mean - field approximations @xcite .",
    "krauth also showed that , in the dilute limit , the condensed atoms are highly concentrated at the center of the trap while the uncondensed or thermal atoms are spread out over a wide range , are dilute and well approximated by a classical , ideal gas .",
    "there is little interaction between the condensed and uncondensed components ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "grter et al.@xcite evaluated @xmath3 for a uniform , bulk , hard sphere bose gas over a wide density range , from dilute to liquid @xmath19he densities . they find that @xmath3 is increased above the ideal bose gas value by interaction in the dilute range . in the uniform gas case the density is not changed by interactions . at liquid @xmath19he densities , @xmath3 is decreased by interaction@xcite .",
    "holzmann et al.@xcite made a direct comparison between hartree - fock ( hf ) and pimc calculations of the number density @xmath23 of atoms in a trap .",
    "the atoms were again represented by hard spheres with @xmath24 . from @xmath23 ,",
    "they find for temperatures near @xmath3 that the condensate fraction @xmath25 is larger in the exact pimc evaluation than in the hf approximation .",
    "the energy beyond the hartree - fock approximation is often denoted the `` correlation '' energy .",
    "this correlation apparently allows @xmath25 to increase at a given @xmath26 and allows condensation to begin at a higher temperature . at lower temperature @xmath27",
    ", there is excellent agreement between the pimc and hf @xmath23 .",
    "the increase in @xmath25 with exact representation of the interaction effects is consistent with the corresponding increase in @xmath3 with interaction in the uniform bose gas .",
    "giorgini et al.@xcite have evaluated the ground state energy @xmath28 and the condensate fraction @xmath29 at @xmath30 k of a uniform bose gas over a wide density range @xmath31 using green function monte carlo ( gfmc ) methods .",
    "they find that the mean field results of @xmath28 and the bogoliubov result for @xmath29 agree well with the gfmc values in the density range @xmath32 .",
    "however , there are clear differences at higher densities @xmath33 ( helium density is @xmath18 )",
    ". the results are not sensitive to reasonable variation of the inter - boson potential@xcite .    in this context",
    ", we have evaluated the ground state properties of a trapped , hard sphere bose gas over a wide range of densities using variational monte carlo ( vmc ) methods .",
    "we begin in the dilute limit , small @xmath17 and @xmath34 corresponding to @xmath0 in a trap , and increase both @xmath17 and @xmath21 separately to increase the density up to liquid @xmath19he densities . at the lower densities we compare the energy @xmath28 and root mean square amplitudes @xmath35 and @xmath36 of atoms in an anisotropic trap with gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) results@xcite .",
    "the two methods agree well at low densities but even at densities @xmath37 small differences in @xmath28 are readily apparent .",
    "also , at higher densities we find the effects of interaction depend separately on @xmath17 and @xmath38 , not simply in the product @xmath39 as appears in the gp theory .",
    "as density is increased still further , we find that the condensate is no longer concentrated at the center of the trap .",
    "rather increased interaction ( increased @xmath38 ) depletes the condensate at the center and the condensate appears at the edges of the trap  as found in liquid @xmath19he droplets ( lewart et al.@xcite ) . also , as density increases , correlations in the single particle density appear , reflecting the interaction in a confined space , in the same way that interaction at higher density introduces correlation in the pair correlation function in the uniform case .",
    "we evaluate the momentum distribution and condensate fraction over the dilute to dense range and compare with mean - field results@xcite .    in section 2",
    "we introduce the hamiltonian , the wave function and the mc method and the definition of the natural orbitals .",
    "the results are presented in section 3 and discussed in section 4 .",
    "we consider n bosons of mass @xmath40 confined in an external trapping potential , @xmath41 , and interacting via a two - body potential @xmath42 .",
    "the hamiltonian for this system is : @xmath43 we consider both a spherically symmetric ( s ) harmonic trap and an elliptical ( e ) harmonic trap , @xmath44 & ( e ) \\label{trap_eqn } \\end{array}\\ ] ] here @xmath45 defines the trap potential strength . in the case of the elliptical trap , @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the trap frequency in the perpendicular or @xmath48 plane and @xmath49 the frequency in the @xmath50 direction .",
    "the mean square vibrational amplitude of a single boson at @xmath51 in the trap ( [ trap_eqn ] ) is @xmath52 so that @xmath53 defines the characteristic length of the trap .",
    "the ratio of the frequencies is denoted @xmath54 leading to a ratio of the trap lengths @xmath55 .",
    "we represent the inter boson interaction by a pairwise , hard core potential @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the hard core diameter of the bosons .",
    "clearly , @xmath58 is zero if the bosons are separated by a distance @xmath59 greater than @xmath21 but infinite if they attempt to come within a distance @xmath60 .",
    "the weak interaction limit is @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( where @xmath63 is the local number density ) , a hard core diameter small compared to the dimensions of the trap and compared to the inter - particle spacing @xmath64 . for trapped alkali atoms we have typically @xmath65 . introducing lengths in units of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 as units of energy as in @xcite ,",
    "the hamiltonian is : @xmath69 since there is bose condensation , we have @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the atomic thermal wavelength .",
    "thus we are in the regime where the atomic wavelength is long compared to the hard core diameter , @xmath72 or @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "the scattering of two particles interacting via a hard core potential in the limit @xmath73 is purely @xmath75 wave with scattering length @xmath21 .",
    "if we approximate the full potential between the two particles by a contact potential , @xmath76 the scattering length in this limit between the two is again purely @xmath75 wave with scattering length @xmath21 .",
    "thus we may compare directly results calculated using a hard core potential ( 3 ) and with a contact potential approximation ( 5 ) in the regime @xmath77 .",
    "specifically , we may compare the present mc results with results calculated using ( 5 ) and the mean field , gross- pitaevskii ( gp ) equation .",
    "this comparison is especially interesting in the dilute limit @xmath78 . at high densities",
    "@xmath79 , we expect short range , pair correlations induced by the hard core to be important and short range correlations are not well described by a mean field theory .      to describe the ground state of the @xmath17 bosons ,",
    "we introduce a variational trial wave function which is a product of a single particle function @xmath80 and a pair jastrow function @xcite @xmath81 , @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the variational parameters .",
    "we select a single particle function , @xmath85\\ ] ] which is a ho ground state function having two variational parameters , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . for spherical traps , @xmath86 , and for noninteracting bosons @xmath87 , @xmath88 . for the pair function",
    "we select the exact solution of the schroedinger equation for two particles interacting via the hard core potential ( 3 ) in the limit @xmath89 , i.e. @xmath90 ( see for example huang @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath91 therefore has the correct form for small @xmath92 and has two variational parameters @xmath83 and @xmath84 that describe the spread of the bosons in the trap as the hard core diameter is increased . by constructing the wave function in this way , we limit the number of variational parameters while preserving the correct functional form in the @xmath93 limit . however , the lack of any variational parameters in the jastrow term is a potential source of inaccuracy .",
    "we then minimize the expectation value of the hamiltonian as obtained from @xmath94 with respect to @xmath83 and @xmath84 using the metropolis monte carlo method of integration .",
    "this is accomplished by using a metropolis random walk @xcite to generate a set of @xmath95 particle configurations , @xmath96 which conform to the probability distribution @xmath97 .",
    "we then approximate @xmath98 by summing over the ` local energy ' as follows @xmath99 for a review of the variational monte carlo method , see @xcite .",
    "a goal here is to calculate the condensate fraction and condensate density in the ground state . to do this we require a definition of the condensate single particle state .",
    "following penrose and onsager , lwdin and others @xcite , we take the one - body density matrix ( obdm ) as the fundamental quantity for an interacting system and define the natural single particle orbitals ( no ) in terms of the obdm .    the obdm is @xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the field operator that annihilates a single particle at the point @xmath102 in the system . at @xmath51 ,",

    "the tf ratio agrees well with the mc ratio in the range @xmath242 or @xmath243 .",

    "2 , ( @xmath28 ) has the non - interacting boson limit at @xmath283 . as n increases , ( @xmath28 ) increases .",
    "as seen from ( 31 ) , the mean field energy in the tf approximation @xmath284 increases with n as @xmath285 .",
    "the @xmath286 in fig .",
    "2 follows the dependence approximately .",
    "however , direct evaluation of ( 31 ) shows that @xmath287 underestimates the energy significantly , by 25% at n=20,000 ( n@xmath38 = 86.6 ) .",
    "thus while the thomas fermi density @xmath229 at the center of the trap is accurate , the tf energy is a poor approximation in this density regime .",
    "this is because the tf approximation underestimates the density at large @xmath59 and the high energy particles at large @xmath59 contribute significantly to the energy .",
    "firstly , the mc energy is the e / n of the whole bose gas while the gp equation calculates the @xmath28 of the condensate only . to investigate the effects of depletion on @xmath28 we note , comparing ( 28 ) and ( 30 ) , that the fractional change in energy arising from depletion , @xmath294 , can be related to the fraction of atoms excited out of the condensate as , @xmath295 in the bulk .",
    "the corresponding equation for the trap is , from ( 29 ) and ( 31 ) , @xmath296 these are lowest order expressions . in table  2",
    "we list the depletion of the condensate @xmath297 for the bosons in the anisotropic trap considered in fig .  2 for @xmath298 and @xmath299 predicted by ( [ d4 ] ) .",
    "we expect these predictions to be accurate since @xmath229 is reliable and @xmath288 is small .",
    "the interaction depletes the condensate @xmath300 at @xmath170 . from the above connection between @xmath301 and @xmath302 ,",
    "the energy @xmath303 including depletion is expected to lie 0.7 - 1.6% above the energy of the condensate . on this basis ,",
    "vmc and gp energies are consistent .    to explain the connection between the difference in vmc and gp energies and depletion of the condensate more fully , we have plotted @xmath304 vs @xmath39 in fig .  10 . from ( 31 )",
    ", the difference from the mean field energy arising from depletion is @xmath305 in the tf limit . in fig .",
    "10 , we show the difference in the vmc and gp energies , @xmath306 , verses the product @xmath39 . this difference is obtained from fig .  4 for four values of @xmath307 . the lines in fig .",
    "10 are fits of @xmath308 to the data where the fitting parameters @xmath40 and @xmath309 where allowed to change for each @xmath38 value .",
    "the good fit of these lines shows that @xmath310 reflects the dependence on n expected for a difference in energy arising from exciting bosons out of the condensate .",
    "thus the difference in @xmath286 from @xmath311 is consistent in magnitude and dependence on n and @xmath38 with that expected for an @xmath286 that includes bosons both in and above the condensate while @xmath311 is the energy of bosons in the condensate only .",
    "thus we believe the mc and gp energies differ chiefly because the mc includes  excited \" particles while the gp energy does not .",
    "secondly , the present vmc @xmath28 is a genuine upper bound for the whole gas and could lie above the whole gas energy .",
    "we have not tested the sensitivity of @xmath28 to different choices of the trial wave function .",
    "in addition , while the present pair jastrow function ( [ jastrow_func ] ) is exact in the dilute limit it does not contain any variational parameters and is therefor not optimized for trapped hard spheres at higher densities . as a result ,",
    "at least some of the difference in @xmath286 from @xmath311 could arise from the present choice of trial wave function .",
    "for example , fabrocini and polls ( fp ) have evaluated the whole @xmath28 for bosons in a spherical trap @xmath312 using correlated basis function and hypernetted - chain ( hnc ) methods@xcite .",
    "both methods provide estimates of @xmath28 which lie below the present vmc @xmath28 . at @xmath313 the density ( @xmath314 ) in this trap",
    "is similar to that for @xmath315 in the present elliptical trap . at this density",
    "the hnc @xmath28 lies 0.8% above the gp energy of the condensate while the present vmc @xmath28 is 2.5% above gp .",
    "fp also consider a mean field model incorporating quantum depletion which predicts an increase in @xmath28 of 1.2% above the gp result at this density .",
    "generally , the hnc energy in the trap lies below the energy expected for depletion and may be too low . for example , the hnc energy for a uniform gas of bosons lies above the energy expected for depletion .",
    "definite resolution of these differences awaits a model independent evaluation of @xmath28 by diffusion monte carlo methods .",
    "finally , an important result of the present mc evaluation is that as the boson density @xmath15 increases , the condensate gradually moves from the center of the trap to the edges of the trap as shown in fig .",
    "6 . at large @xmath15",
    ", the condensate is at the edges of the trap . in this limit ,",
    "the depletion of the condensate is large and the condensate seeks the regions of lowest total density which are at the surface of the trap .",
    "both the condensed and uncondensed atoms must be included in the calculation to obtain this effect .",
    "this result is consistent with the calculations in liquid @xmath19he droplets @xcite which find the condensate concentrated at the surface of the droplet ."
