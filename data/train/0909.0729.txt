    "in the last several decades , co adsorption on pt surfaces has been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "this large interest is partly due to the deceiving simplicity of the system and its industrial importance in catalytic processes , such as co oxidation and fischer - tropsch synthesis.@xcite + however , a simple system such as co adsorbed on the pt(111)-surface , has and still does cause quite some controversy .",
    "three decades ago adsorption site preference and measured adsorption energies were the subject of discussion among experimental researchers .",
    "these problems have meanwhile been resolved and experimental results have converged to a coherent and detailed picture of this system.@xcite on the theorists side however , a discussion has emerged during the last decade regarding the unexpected failure of prevalent density functional theory ( dft ) approximations to properly predict the co / pt(111 ) site preference . from experiments",
    "it is found that the ontop site is most stable in the low density regime , while local density approximation ( lda ) and generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) calculations show a preference for the threefold coordinated hollow adsorption site .",
    "the cause of this co / pt(111 ) puzzle seems to originate from the tendency of lda and gga to favor higher coordination and the flatness of the potential surface describing adsorption of co on the pt(111 ) surface.@xcite this has lead to a search for better or alternative functionals in recent years.@xcite +",
    "although the incorrect site prediction is a problem for dft , this does not mean that the obtained geometries and derived physical properties are incorrect.@xcite even more , the calculated scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) images derived from the geometries show excellent qualitative agreement with the experiment.@xcite + with the recent discovery of pt induced nanowire ( nw ) arrays on ge(001 ) , a new pt based adsorption surface becomes available.@xcite decoration of these nws with co - molecules opens the way to the formation of one - dimensional ( @xmath0d ) molecular chains .",
    "although the adsorption of single co - molecules on these pt induced nws has been observed experimentally , true molecular chains remain to be observed.@xcite + room temperature ( rt ) stm experiments , by ncel _ _ et al.__@xcite , showed the co molecules to be very mobile along the nws .",
    "later , kockmann _ _ et al.__@xcite performed experiments at @xmath1 k to suppress this mobility , and observed a long range repulsive interaction between pairs of co molecules on a nw . in those experiments the nws were considered to be composed of pt dimers in the troughs of a modified ge(001 ) surface , called @xmath2-terrace,@xcite allowing for a straight forward interpretation of the observed stm images .",
    "the co molecules were suggested to be adsorbed on the bridge positions of the nw dimers , comparable to the adsorption of co on the pt(001 ) surface.@xcite + calculations on the interaction of co with a free standing pt monatomic wire suggest a similar behavior.@xcite however , in recent theoretical studies we showed the nws to be modeled by pt induced ge nws.@xcite in this model the nws consist of ge dimers placed in the pt lined troughs of a pt modified ge(001 ) reconstructed surface . since the sticking probability and affinity for co on ge is known to be low,@xcite while being high for pt , it would be surprising if co molecules would adsorb on the ge nw atoms .",
    "this might lead to the suggestion that the theoretical models , proposed in ref .",
    ", are in disagreement with the experiment .",
    "how can this theoretical model be reconciled with the experimental observations ? + in this work we study the adsorption of co on the pt induced nws starting from the theoretical models we proposed previously in ref .   and .",
    "ab initio _ dft calculations , formation and adsorption energies are calculated .",
    "theoretical stm images , generated using the tersoff - hamann method , are compared to experimental stm images to identify the adsorption sites and geometries observed in experiment .",
    "+ this paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sc : theormeth ] the used theoretical methods are described . in sec .",
    "[ sc : results ] we present our results , which will be discussed more in depth in sec .  [",
    "sc : discusion ] . finally , in sec .  [ sc : conclusion ] the conclusions are given .",
    "the calculations are performed within the dft framework using the projector augmented waves method and the ceperley - alder lda functional , as implemented in the vasp program .",
    "@xcite a @xmath3 ev kinetic energy cutoff is applied for the plane wave basis set .",
    "co molecules are placed on the models of both types of pt induced nws on ge(001 ) we presented in ref .  .",
    "the surface / nw system is modeled by periodically repeated slabs of @xmath4 layers of ge atoms with nw reconstructions on both surfaces .",
    "a vacuum region of @xmath5   is used to separate the periodic images of the slab along the @xmath6 axis . due to the computational cost and the small size of the co molecule a @xmath7 surface cell for the solitary wire geometry , and a @xmath8 surface cell for the array wire geometry",
    "the brillouin zone of the @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) surface unit cell is sampled using a @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) monkhorst - pack special @xmath11-point mesh.@xcite to optimize the geometry of the surface / adsorbate system the conjugate gradient method is used while the positions of the ge atoms in the center two layers are kept fixed as to represent the bulk of the system .",
    "+ stm images are calculated using the tersoff - hamann method in its most basic form , with the stm tip approximated as a point - source.@xcite the integrated local density of states ( ldos ) is calculated as @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the fermi energy . because the tunneling current is proportional to the integrated ldos in the tersoff - hamann model , an stm - tip following a surface of constant current can be simulated through plotting a surface of constant ( theoretical ) ldos : @xmath14 , with c a constant . for each c this construction returns a height @xmath6 as a function of the position @xmath15 .",
    "this heightmap is then mapped linearly onto a gray scale .",
    "the constant c is chosen such that the isosurface has a height @xmath6 between @xmath16 and @xmath17   above the highest atom of the surface .",
    "as is shown in literature , a small difference exists between solitary nws ( nw@xmath0 ) and nws in arrays ( nw@xmath16).@xcite in experiment this difference presents itself as the appearance of a @xmath18 periodicity at lower temperatures , which was traced back , in previous calculations , to the presence of an extra pt atom bound to every pair of nw dimers.@xcite since this extra pt atom introduces new possible adsorption sites and geometries , co adsorption on both nw geometries is studied . + because some of the initial adsorption geometries relaxed into the same final structure , and because in some cases the geometry was modified extensively during relaxation , the adsorption sites presented in this manuscript are those found after relaxation .",
    "+ the nw geometry is a metastable configuration and the adsorption of co sometimes introduces large deformations of the surface .",
    "therefore we define both a formation and adsorption energy in these systems .",
    "the formation energy indicates the energy gain / loss of the entire system due to the co adsorption and the subsequent changes in the surface structure .",
    "it is defined ( per @xmath19-surface unit cell ) as : @xmath20 with @xmath21 the total energy of the adsorbate - surface system , @xmath22 the total energy of a pristine slab - nw system and @xmath23 the total energy of a free co molecule .",
    "@xmath24 is the number of co molecules per surface unit in the system and the division by two is because co is adsorbed at both faces of the slab .",
    "a negative value of the formation energy indicates an increase in stability of the system .",
    "the adsorption energy refers to the binding energy of the co molecule to the surface . here",
    "any contribution due to surface deformation is excluded .",
    "it is defined ( per co molecule ) as : @xmath25 with @xmath26 the total energy of the surface with the adsorption induced deformations and without adsorbed co molecule .",
    "solitary nws consist of ge dimers located in the pt lined troughs of a pt modified ge(001 ) surface . figure  [ fig:1nwadsorbsites]a shows the adsorption sites studied for this nw1 surface reconstruction .",
    "+    the adsorption and formation energies are given in table  [ table:1energeom_nw1 ] , as are some geometrical parameters , defined in fig .",

    ".formation and adsorption energies for co adsorbed on the nw1-surface .",
    "adsorption sites are shown in fig .  [ fig:1nwadsorbsites]a .",
    "t ( b ) refers to top ( bridge ) adsorption . and are the c - o and c - pt(ge ) bond lengths . for the a3 adsorption site",
    "the value between brackets is the c - pt bond length between c and the pt atom in the bottom of the trough . and are the bond angles with regard to the surface plane . in case of bridge adsorption",
    "is the angle between the two c - surface bonds . for the adsorption sites a1 to a4",

    "arrows in ( b ) show the drift direction of the nw dimers.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] +      from these calculations and the experiments presented in literature , the possible application of this system for @xmath0d molecular electronics becomes very unlikely .",
    "the long - ranged interaction observed by kockmann _",
    "et al . _ and its explanation in light of the calculations performed in this work , seems to be the main problem . + up to this point we mainly focussed on identifying the experimentally observed structures .",
    "the b@xmath29 adsorption configuration , and the comparable a@xmath17b configuration have not yet been discussed in light of experiments , while showing almost the best adsorption energies .",
    "the calculated stm images for these structures show something very peculiar , more specifically , the total lack of an image for the co molecule . in case of the a@xmath17b adsorption site",
    "a large protrusion is still visible , however this is an ejected ge atom of the nw dimer ( _ _ cf.__fig .  [",
    "fig:2a3akat3geom]b ) .",
    "this ejection was due to the limited unitcell size .",
    "the steric repulsion between two periodic copies of the co molecule and the single ge nw dimer prohibited the ge dimer to be displaced sufficiently along the nw direction . to remove this ` computational artefact ' the ejected ge atom is removed ( a@xmath17b1 ) , and in a second calculation both ge atoms forming the nw dimer are removed ( a@xmath17b2 ) .",
    "also an adsorption structure with b@xmath29 configuration on a nw@xmath0 surface is build ( a@xmath27 ) , using a double nw@xmath0 surface cell .",
    "( solid black curve ) , the a@xmath17b@xmath16 ( red dashed curve ) and the a@xmath28 ( green dash - dot curve ) configuration .",
    "the linescans are taken along the arrows shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:9_stm_b5_a3b2_a7 ] ( a ) , ( c ) , and ( e ) . the arrows in ( a ) indicate the positions of the co molecules , while c and o show the positions of the c and o atom in ( b ) . , title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] +    table  [ table:4_1dmolel ] shows the formation and adsorption energies for these new structures in comparison to the b@xmath29- and a@xmath17b - structures .",
    "removal of the ge nw atoms clearly decreases the formation energy of the surface , which is due to the uncovering of the imbedded pt atoms.@xcite the adsorption energy of the co molecule however remains roughly the same .",
    "also the geometrical parameters barely change .",
    "the bond lengths decrease slightly , due to the reduced steric repulsion between the co molecules and the ge dimer atoms , moving the co molecule closer to the surface .",
    "+ in case of the a@xmath27 adsorption configuration , the lack of anchor point for the nw dimers causes them to drift away from the co molecule due to the steric repulsion . which , because of the limited unit cell size , results in the formation of a ge tetramer as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:8_bridgesites]b .",
    "the geometric parameters for the co molecules in the b@xmath29 and a@xmath27 adsorption configurations are almost identical .",
    "however the distance between a co molecule and the nearest ge atom of a nw dimer is approximately @xmath30   in case of the a@xmath27 configuration , while it is only @xmath31   in case of the b@xmath29 configuration .",
    "this indicates the improvement in adsorption energy , going from the b@xmath29 to the a@xmath27 configuration , can be attributed to the reduction of the steric repulsion between the co molecule and the ge nw dimers .",
    "+ because uncovering the imbedded pt atoms has a negative influence on the formation energy , a model is build with the entire nw removed and replaced by a maximum coverage of co molecules in an a@xmath27 configuration ( a@xmath28 ) .",
    "the a@xmath28 contains two co molecules per @xmath32 surface cell ( _ cf . _  fig .",
    "[ fig:8_bridgesites]c ) , making this a four times higher coverage than the a@xmath27 case . a large increase in the formation energy",
    "is found , while the steric repulsion only has a minute influence on the adsorption energy of the co molecules .",
    "furthermore , the geometrical parameters remain almost unchanged making this , from the geometrical point of view , a very good candidate for @xmath0d molecular electronics .",
    "however , there is one small problem .",
    "these co molecules in either b or t bridging configuration are invisible in stm .",
    "figure  [ fig:9_stm_b5_a3b2_a7 ] shows both filled and empty state pictures of the b@xmath29 , a@xmath16b@xmath16 , and a@xmath28 adsorption geometries .",
    "for the b@xmath29 adsorption configuration the linescan , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:10_ls_b5_a3b2_a7 ] , is almost unmodified compared to the linescan of the pristine nw .",
    "the only modification is found in the line scan orthogonal to the trough / nw . in case of a t bridging configuration , the dimer of the qdr which is bound to the c atom is higher than the dimer bound to the o atom , while the opposite is true for the b bridging configuration .",
    "so if one would succeed in stripping away the ge nw without damaging the underlying substrate , a high coverage of co molecules in bridging configuration could be recognized by this asymmetry in the qdr images .",
    "the formation and adsorption energies are highly favorable , making this also energetically an interesting template for @xmath0d molecular electronics . +",
    "in this paper we have studied the adsorption of co molecules on pt induced nws on ge(001 ) using _ ab initio _ dft calculations . we show co has a strong preference for adsorption on the pt atoms imbedded in the ge(001 ) surface . as a consequence co molecules do not bind directly on top of the ge dimers forming the nws , contrary to the experimental assumptions . by direct comparison of calculated stm images to experimental stm images",
    "we have successfully identified the observed adsorption sites .",
    "we have shown that the pt atoms lining the troughs in which the ge nws are imbedded provide the necessary adsorption sites to explain all experimentally observed co adsorption sites .",
    "co molecules in ontop configurations next to the nw tilt toward it , presenting stm images located on the nw . co molecules bound in between nw dimers , with the o atom also bound to a ge nw dimer modify the electronic structure of this ge atom sufficiently to give the appearance of a protrusion on this ge dimer .",
    "this gives rise to the short - bridge co adsorption site observed by ncel _",
    "et al . _ a co molecule bound in an ontop configuration on the extra pt atom of the nw@xmath16-surface , showing a protrusion at negative bias and a depression at positive bias , is found to show good agreement with the experimentally observed long - bridge site , seen by kockmann _",
    "et al . _ the short - bridge site observed by this group is identified as a co molecule in a bridge configuration in between nw dimers . +",
    "a path for mobility along the wire is presented , showing the co molecule to move along the pt atoms of the underlying qdrs . the long - ranged interaction observed by kockmann _",
    "is explained trough the dislocation of nw dimers , in the vicinity of the co molecule.these dislocated nw dimers in turn block the nearby co - adsorption sites .",
    "+ we also predict the presence of invisible bridging co molecules , and present methods for observing them experimentally . also the possibility of @xmath0d molecular electronics is touched .",
    "after removal of the ge nw dimers , stable , invisible wires of parallel co molecules , along the pt lined troughs , can be obtained .",
