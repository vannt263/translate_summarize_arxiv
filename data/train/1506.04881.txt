    "they were cleaned by sonication , first in acetone then in isopropyl alcohol ( ipa ) , each for 5 min .",
    "they were then thoroughly rinsed with deionized water and dried in a stream of n@xmath28 .",
    "the clean si wafers were spin coated with mma resist ( copolymer resist el9 , microchem ) at 4000rpm for 60s , followed by baking at 180@xmath29c on a hotplate for 2min .",
    "pmma resist ( polymer resist a2 , microchem ) was deposited on the mma layer by spinning at 2000rpm for 60s , followed by baking at 180@xmath29c on a hotplate for 2min .",
    "an array of 250 nm diameter circular dots with 1@xmath17 m spacing was written using a raith 150 ultrahigh - resolution e - beam lithography system ( raith gmbh , dortmund , germany ) .",
    "the patterned wafer was developed in mibk / ipa 1:3 for 1min , followed by rinsing with ipa for 20s and drying in an n@xmath28 stream .",
    "a nickel dot array was prepared by e - beam evaporating a 100 nm thick nickel layer at a base pressure of @xmath30torr with a rate of 1 / s .",

    "the nickel nanodot arrays served as masks in the following dry etching .",
    "vertical silicon nanowire arrays were fabricated by applying time - multiplexed reactive ion etching in an inductively coupled plasma deep reactive ion etching machine ( icp - drie , plasmatherm slr770 ) . in order to form nanopillars with a well defined breaking point ,",
    "we have implemented a bosch process , i.e. passivation followed by anisotropic etching .",
    "a variation of the ratio between the etching and the passivation times varies the scalloping and leads to different rod diameters .",
