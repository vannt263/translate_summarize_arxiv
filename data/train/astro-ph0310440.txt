    "understanding the origin and nature of galaxy scaling relations is a fundamental quest of any successful theory of galaxy formation .",
    "the success of a particular theory will be judged by its ability to predict the slope , scatter , and zero - point of any robust galaxy scaling relation at any particular wavelength . some observed scaling relations in spiral galaxies , based on their size , luminosity , and rotation speed , can be reproduced _ individually _ to fairly good accuracy by invoking galaxy formation models that include virial equilibrium after dissipational collapse of spherical cold dark matter ( cdm ) halos and angular momentum conservation ( e.g. mo , mao , & white 1998 , hereafter mmw98 ; van den bosch 1998 , 2000 , hereafter collectively as vdb00 ; navarro & steinmetz 2000 , hereafter ns00 ; firmani & avila - reese 2000 ; hereafter far00 ) .",
    "one of the most firmly established empirical scaling relation of disk galaxies is the tully - fisher relation ( tfr ; tully & fisher 1977 ) ; a tight correlation between the total luminosity and the rotation speed of a disk galaxy .",
    "however , to date , no single cdm - based model of galaxy formation can _ simultaneously _ reproduce the slope , zero - point , scatter , and color trends of the tfr , match the shape and normalization of the luminosity function , and explain the sizes , colors , and metallicity of disk galaxies ( see , e.g , .",
    "vdb00 ; bell  et  al .  2003 ) .",
    "in addition , simultaneously accounting for the mass and angular momentum distribution of spiral galaxies in a gas dynamical context remains a major challenge for hierarchical formation models ( navarro & white 1994 ; bullock et  al .",
    "2001b ; van den bosch et  al .  2002b ) .",
    "a complete theory of galaxy scaling relations awaits a fuller understanding of structure forming mechanisms and evolutionary processes ( e.g. star formation , merging , feedback , and cooling prescriptions ) in galaxies ( see somerville & primack 1999 for a comparison of `` recipes '' among competing theories . ) likewise , the fine - tuning of these galaxy formation and evolutionary models demands a careful examination of empirical scaling relations of galaxies .    in order to set up a framework for the study of galaxy scaling relations",
    ", we examine the correlations of parameters related by the virial theorem , @xmath9 , for bright galaxies ( i.e. where feedback effects are minimal ) .",
    "we consider three fundamental observables for each disk galaxy : the total luminosity @xmath10 , the stellar scale length @xmath11 of the exponential disk , and the observed circular velocity @xmath12 .",
    "the stellar mass , @xmath13 , can be estimated from the luminosity by assuming a stellar mass - to - light ratio , @xmath14 .",
    "the size - luminosity ( sl ) relation of galaxy disks is also expressed as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the surface brightness .",
    "key to mapping fundamental dynamical trends in spiral galaxies , the measurement of tf and sl relations and detection of their correlated residuals require velocity amplitudes measured at a suitably chosen radius representative of the flat part of resolved rotation curves , red / infrared magnitudes to minimize extinction and population effects , accurate disk scale lengths , and , ideally , color terms with a broad baseline ( e.g. @xmath17 ) to test for @xmath18 variations in the stellar population and extinction effects .",
    "our goal in this paper is thus to assemble such a data base .    a study of scaling relations in irregular and spiral galaxies by salpeter & hoffman ( 1996 ; hereafter sh96 ) yielded the correlations @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , are the and dynamical masses , and a characteristic radius , respectively . the blue luminosities ,",
    "as used in that study , are notoriously sensitive to dust extinction and stellar population effects and dynamical effects can not be simply isolated .",
    "a new study of scaling relations in the ( near-)infrared would provide more robust dynamical constraints to galaxy formation models . while the tfr has been examined at nearly all optical - ir wavelengths ( e.g. strauss & willick 1995 ; verheijen 2001 , hereafter v01 ) , comparatively few multi - wavelength analyses of the sl relation ( slr ) of spiral galaxies have been done so far ( sh96 ; mmw98 ; shen et  al .",
    "this is partly because the accurate disk scale lengths needed to calibrate the slr , at any wavelength , have only recently become available for large databases ( e.g. courteau 1996 ; dale et  al .",
    "1999 ; macarthur et  al .",
    "2003 , hereafter mch03 ) .",
    "the recent availability of light profile decompositions for very large galaxy databases ( e.g. sloan digital sky survey and two micron all - sky survey ; ) heralds a new era for the study of galaxy scaling relations ( e.g. shen et  al .",
    "we will return to considerations about the slr in .",
    "the remainder of this section focuses on the tfr and the dependences of its scatter on galaxy observables .",
    "the empirical tfr is expressed as l v^a_obs [ eq : irtf ] with the near - ir log - slope @xmath23 ( willick et  al .",
    "1997 ; giovanelli et  al .",
    "1997 , hereafter g97 ; courteau et  al .",
    "2000 ; v01 ) . reported values of the log - slope @xmath24 range from 2.8 in the blue to 4.0 in the infrared ( willick et  al .",
    "1997 ; tully & pierce 2000 ; v01 ) for both high and low surface brightness galaxies ( zwaan et  al .  1995 ; v01 ) .",
    "log - slopes steeper than @xmath25 in the infrared typically result from small samples and excessive pruning on the basis of idealized morphology or kinematics , a narrow range of inclinations , redshift cutoffs , etc .",
    "( bernstein et  al .  1994 ; v01 ; kannappan , fabricant , & franx 2002 , hereafter kff02 ) .",
    "the slope , scatter , and zero - point of blue tfrs are predominantly dominated by stellar population and dust extinction effects ( e.g. aaronson & mould 1983 ; c97 ; g97 ; willick et  al .",
    "1997 ; tully & pierce 2000 ) and on the techniques used to recover the major observables and fitting for fundamental relations ( e.g. strauss & willick 1995 ; c97 ; v01 ; bell & de jong 2001 ; kff02 ) . because we are mainly interested in masses , rather than luminosities",
    ", we do not concern ourselves with tfrs and other scaling relations measured at blue wavelengths .",
    "we show in appendix a that the fundamental form of the tfr , based on dynamical principles only , is given by @xmath26 , that is @xmath27 .",
    "the modern interpretation of the tfr is that of a correlation between the total baryonic mass of a galaxy , inferred via its infrared luminosity and a stellar mass - to - light ratio and total gas mass ( + he ) , and its total mass inferred from the asymptotic circular velocity of the galaxy disk ( mcgaugh et  al .",
    "2000 ; bell & de jong 2001 ; v01 ) .",
    "the `` baryonic '' tfr is expressed as _ bary v^a_bary_obs [ eq : bartf ]    since disk gas mass fractions typically increase with decreasing luminosity ( i.e. , mcgaugh & de blok 1997 ) , one typically has that @xmath28 .    while the log - slope of the tfr can be reproduced fairly well by most cdm - based structure formation models ( e.g. mmw98 ; vdb00 ; ns00 ) , the predicted scatter can be large compared to the inferred `` cosmic '' scatter of @xmath29 mag in red / infrared bands ( willick et  al .",
    "1996 ; v01 ) and interpretations about its dependence differ ( see below ) .",
    "besides the basic understanding of the slopes of galaxy scaling relations , the dependence of their scatter has also been addressed by many , especially for the tfr ( e.g. aaronson & mould 1983 ; giraud 1986 ; rhee 1996 ; willick et  al .",
    "1997 ; kff02 ) , and can be used to set stringent constraints on structure formation models ( courteau & rix 1999 , hereafter cr99 ; heavens & jimenez 1999 ; far00 ; ns00 ; v01 ; buchalter , jimenez , & kamionkowski 2001 ; shen , mo , & shu 2002 ) .",
    "while various trends in the scatter of the blue tfr have been reported in the past , no correlations of the infrared tf residuals with inclination , size , concentration , gas fraction , or far infrared luminosity have thus far been reported ( aaronson & mould 1983 ; v01 ) .",
    "the dependence of near - ir tfr scatter on color and surface brightness is however still a matter of contention that we discuss in .",
    "the slr scatter is also addressed in .",
    "the study of scaling relations in galaxies has benefited from the two - pronged application of the tfr for the purposes of : ( i ) estimating relative distances to measure deviations from the mean hubble flow ( see , e.g. , strauss & willick 1995 and the reviews in the `` cosmic flows 1999 '' proceedings by courteau , strauss , & willick 1999 ) ; and ( ii ) testing galaxy formation and evolution models ( dalcanton , spergel & summers 1997 ; mmw98 ; vdb00 ) .",
    "the philosophy of sample selection and calibration differs in both cases . for cosmic flow analyses ,",
    "the calibration and science samples must be pruned mostly on the basis of morphology and visual appearance in order to minimize systematic errors and thus ensure the smallest possible magnitude ( distance ) error .",
    "since tf scatter depends strongly on the slope of the tf , it is found that the combination of steepness , magnitude errors , extinction correction , and sky stability favors red ( @xmath30 ) bands for smallest distance errors and cosmic flows applications ( courteau 1997 , hereafter c97 ; v01 ) .",
    "the accuracy of bulk flow solutions also depends on the size of the sample . in order to collect large enough samples ,",
    "tf calibrations for flow studies rely mostly on line widths or rotation curves that can be collected relatively quickly on modest aperture telescopes .",
    "these rotation measures typically sample the disk rotation out to 2 to 3 disk scale lengths ( c97 ) .",
    "by contrast , use of the tfr as a test bed for galaxy formation models requires the widest range of morphological types , to sample all structural properties , and that extinction and stellar population effects be minimized to isolate genuine dynamical correlations .",
    "the nearly dust - insensitive @xmath31-band is thus the one of choice for such applications ( v01)-band rather than at @xmath31 ; the @xmath32-band tfr is hardest to control due to airglow fluctuations ( jarrett et  al .",
    "2003 ) . ] .",
    "rotation velocities are preferably extracted from fully resolved rotation curves obtained using aperture synthesis maps that sample the disk rotation out to 4 to 5 disk scale lengths .",
    "ideally , the study of scaling relations should rely on homogeneous samples assembled with the very purpose of testing for broad structural and dynamical differences ; at the moment , we must contend with the more finely pruned heterogeneous samples of late - type spirals that have been collected during the last decade mostly for flow studies .",
    "these data , which include near - infrared luminosities , and sometimes colors , for large samples of galaxies , still enable us to characterize the dependence of scaling relations and examine various constraints of structure formation models , in ways hitherto unsettled .    in courteau",
    "et  al .  ( 2003 ) , we showed that barred and unbarred galaxies have similar physical properties and that they share the same tfr .",
    "as a natural extension of this study and cr99 , in we use the extensive all - sky distance - redshift catalogs presented in to characterize the scatter of the tf and sl relations in terms of galaxy observables for a broad suite of galaxy types .",
    "in we bolster the notions of surface brightness independence and color dependence of the tfr , as well as that of surface brightness dependence for the slr , for disk galaxies .",
    "this prompts a renewed examination of the correlated scatter study of cr99 which favored high dark - to - luminous mass fractions in galaxy disk s interiors .",
    "in we develop a simple analytical interpretation for the origin of the galaxy virial relations , such as the tf and sl relations , in a cosmological setting .",
    "the analysis of the scatter in the scaling relations , and a discussion about the implications of our results in terms of existing galaxy formation models , are presented in our companion paper ( s. courteau et  al .  2004a , in preparation ; hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "[ sec : data ]    we consider four samples for which accurate galaxy observables , including crucial rotational velocities , are available .",
    "these include ( a ) the large @xmath3-band survey of galaxy distances for bright field spirals in the southern sky by mathewson , ford , & buchhorn ( 1992 ; hereafter `` * mat * '' ) ; the all - sky @xmath3-band tf surveys by ( b ) dale et  al .

    "disk scale lengths for the uma sample were measured from a `` marking the disk '' technique but the fit baseline is unspecified and erratic fits are reported in tully et  al .",

    "the size distributions are less robust than the tfr owing to a number of factors such as , ( a ) small range of galaxy sizes in some samples ( shellflow , uma ) , ( b ) lack of a uniform and universal definition of scale length ( mch03 ) , and ( c ) intrinsic scatter due to the natural dispersion of the spin parameter , @xmath69 ( ) . whether scale lengths are measured from b / d decompositions or `` marked '' over a specified range of surface brightnesses ( while omitting the bulge region or not ) can yield scale differences greater than 20% ( mch03 ) .",
    "the overlap between the four samples is too small ( in some cases non - existant ) to calibrate such systematic errors .",
    "thus it is difficult to determine how much of the lower correlation coefficients in the sl and sv relations is due to genuine dynamical processes and@xmath70or inadequate scale lengths . in spite of potential pathologies with the mat scale lengths ( see ) ,",

    "<S> this paper presents an exploration of two fundamental scaling relations of spiral galaxies , the luminosity - rotation speed ( or tully - fisher ; tf ) relation , and the size - luminosity ( sl ) relation , and the dependences of their scatter , at red and infrared bands . </S>",

    "<S> we derive the first extensive @xmath5-band tf and sl relations . at a given infrared luminosity , </S>",
    "<S> the tf velocity residuals are correlated with infrared color , which in turn is determined by the variations in galaxy formation ages and dark halo concentrations ; these residuals are fully independent of surface brightness and other tested galaxy observables . </S>",
    "<S> we verify that tf relations ( tfrs ) for various morphological types have different zero points , but a common slope , such that early - type ( redder ) disks rotate faster than later - type ( bluer ) systems of the same luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the morphological type dependence of the tfr is a direct consequence of the more fundamental scatter dependence on color , which itself is related to the star formation history of a galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the scatter of the sl relation is mostly dominated by surface brightness , but color also plays a small role . </S>",
    "<S> the observed systematic variations of disk size with color , for a given luminosity , are weaker than expected , perhaps as a result of uncertainty in disk scale length measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the tf and sl residuals for hsb and lsb galaxies are weakly correlated with @xmath6 , in agreement with the earlier claim by courteau & rix ( 1999 , apj , 513 , 561 ) , and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the former result suggests that spiral disks of all color , brightness and barredness may be , on average , dominated by dark matter even in their inner parts ( the so - called `` sub - maximal disk '' solution at @xmath8 disk scale lengths ) . </S>",
    "<S> the observed scaling relations of disk galaxies are likely the result of the simplest scenario of galaxy formation in the standard cosmological picture , but their color dependence remains a challenge to hierarchical structure formation models . </S>",
    "<S> these relations and their derivatives are analysed in terms of , and serve as stringent constraints for , galaxy formation models in our companion paper . </S>"
