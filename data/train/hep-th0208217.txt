    "the decay of unstable d - branes is an important and challenging problem in string theory . in order to understand such processes",
    "it is important to obtain a reliable description of the dynamics of the tachyons which arise from open strings on unstable d - branes . in the last few years considerable",
    "progress has been made starting with sen s proposal to identify the closed string vacuum with the tachyon vacuum on unstable d - branes in superstring theory ( see @xcite for a review and references ) .",
    "furthermore , a class of time independent kink solutions corresponding to lower dimensional d - branes was identified with marginal boundary deformations of the open string sigma model @xcite .",
    "more recently sen has obtained a family of time dependent tachyon solutions as marginal deformations of the open string sigma model @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "an analysis of the stress tensor obtained from the boundary state for a decaying d - brane @xcite shows that the decay of an unstable d - brane results in a gas with finite energy density but vanishing pressure .",
    "an interesting question is then to what extent these features can be obtained from a first derivative effective action for the tachyon @xcite .",
    "typically a tachyon effective action contains an infinite number of higher derivative terms which , unlike the case for massless string modes , can not be simply neglected .",
    "therefore no truncation to first derivatives can be expected to capture all of the dynamics of the tachyon .",
    "furthermore , even if the full effective action were known , without some kind of simplifying structure it would be near impossible to obtain concrete results .",
    "in addition it is not clear whether an initial value problem can be formulated",
    ". however first derivative truncations of the tachyon effective action have been rather sucessful for describing d - branes as static tachyonic solitons @xcite-@xcite .",
    "one may therefore hope that a truncated action could also be useful to describe the dynamics of tachyon condensation .",
    "in @xcite sen argued that some qualitative features of full tree - level string theory , such as the asymptotic vanishing of the pressure , are indeed reproduced by a born - infeld ( bi ) type action @xcite .",
    "unlike the case of massless gauge fields , the bi - type action has not been inferred from on - shell string theory and marginal tachyon profiles do not solve the equations of motion . on the other hand",
    "there is a well defined prescription to extract the tachyon effective action from boundary string field theory ( bsft ) @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "unfortunately this action is known explictly only for constant and linear tachyon profiles and the marginal tachyon profiles are also not solutions of the bsft effective action .",
    "nevertheless bsft has been quite sucessful in describing some aspects of tachyon condensation to lower dimensional d - branes @xcite .",
    "furthermore it was shown in @xcite that some qualitative features of the tachyon dynamics obtained from the bsft - action are consistent with conformal field theory results . however , while the various effective actions that have appeared in the literature are remarkably similar for static profiles , they could hardly differ more for time dependent ones .",
    "this is illustrated in figure @xmath0 where the kinetic part of the effective action is plotted as a function of @xmath1 for three different proposals ( the details will be explained below ) .",
    "given this state of affairs , it is of interest establish to what extent these properties are generic in non - linear , first derivative effective actions for the tachyon .",
    "in addition we would like to determine the most appropriate behaviour of the effective action for time dependent configurations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is establish general properties of suitable first derivative tachyon actions derived under a minimal set of reasonable theoretical assumptions .",
    "we find that some observed qualitative phenomena in tachyon condensation are rather generic and are reproduced by a large class of effective actions , although the exact quantitative predictions differ significantly .",
    "on the other hand we find that some global properties of marginal tachyon profiles are beyond the scope of first derivative effective actions .    in this context",
    "we also analyse a tachyon action proposed earlier @xcite which closely resembles the other effective actions for time independent configurations , but has the advantage that marginal deformations are solutions to the equations of motion .",
    "furthermore , the time - dependent marginal tachyon profiles in @xcite are also exact classical solutions for this action .",
    "we find that equation of state obtained from this action is in good quantitative agreement with the exact results of conformal field theory .",
    "finally the potential cosmological relevance of scalar field actions with non - standard kinetic terms has been pointed out in @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to analyse tachyon effective actions from this point of view .",
    "this was done in @xcite for the bi - type action and in @xcite for the bsft - action .",
    "we will see that cosmological implications of our tachyon action are qualitatively similar to these results , although the details are again different .",
    "finding the general tachyon solution in string theory would require a detailed knowledge of open superstring field theory",
    ". however , using the fact that these solutions correspond to conformally invariant backgrounds for the open string sigma model , a subset of open string tachyon solutions on a non - bps @xmath2-brane in type ii string theory can be obtained as exactly marginal deformations of the boundary conformal field theory .",
    "specifically , as is well known @xcite-@xcite , @xmath3 are exactly marginal deformations of the open string polyakov action on a non - bps @xmath4-brane .",
    "the physical properties of this open string background are encoded in the corresponding boundary state @xmath5 @xcite , where and @xmath6 label the non - bps d@xmath7-brane worldvolume . ]",
    "@xmath8 here @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the same as for a @xmath11 brane , while @xmath12 describes the @xmath13 dependence of the marginal deformation .",
    "in particular , the energy momentum tensor for a marginal kink profile can be obtained by evaluating the matrix element of the boundary state @xmath14 with the closed string graviton state @xmath15 .",
    "concretely we have @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the tension of a non - bps @xmath2-brane while @xmath18 and @xmath19 parametrise the level @xmath20 part of the boundary state @xcite @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the closed string fock vacuum with momentum @xmath24 . using similar arguments as in @xcite",
    "we then find , for a @xmath25 kink , @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 in particular @xmath29 is independent of @xmath13 as it should be .",
    "for @xmath30 close to @xmath31 the energy density is peaked about @xmath32 .",
    "we note that the boundary state and , in particular all components of the stress tensor are periodic in @xmath30 with period @xmath0 .",
    "this periodicity can also bee seen by analysing the spectrum @xcite or by analysing the cylinder diagram on an orbifold @xcite .",
    "the origin of this periodicity can be traced to the fact that the vertex operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 form an @xmath35 current alegbra . here",
    "@xmath34 generates translations along the @xmath13 direction .",
    "since the exponential of these operators appears in the path integral , the resulting correlation functions gain a periodic dependence on the coefficient @xmath30 due to the compactness of @xmath36 .",
    "time dependent boundary perturbations can be obtained by analytic continuation of the above profile @xcite . concretely , by performing the double wick rotation @xmath37 we find that @xmath38 and @xmath39 are , at tree level , exactly marginal , time dependent tachyon profiles .",
    "note that in the @xmath40 case we must also wick rotate @xmath41 to obtain a real profile .",
    "therefore we expect that the peridocity observed for @xmath30 in the space - like case is now broken . indeed for space - like marginal deformations we saw that the perodicity in @xmath30 came from an @xmath35 current alegbra of the @xmath13 free boson cft .",
    "if we wick rotate to a time - like free boson this becomes an @xmath42 current algebra , which has only one compact direction .",
    "this must correspond to the deformations generated by @xmath43 since these arise from wick rotating @xmath44 which does not require that @xmath30 is also wick rotated .",
    "in addition @xmath45 now generates time translations which are no longer periodic .",
    "the stress tensor for the time - like @xmath43 profiles is again given by ( [ stress ] ) with @xcite @xmath46 and @xmath47 for time dependent marginal deformations the conserved energy @xmath48 is @xmath49 while the pressure @xmath50 vanishes as the tachyon approaches the vacuum configuration .",
    "more specifically , as @xmath51 , @xmath52 if we consider marginal deformations of the form @xmath53 then we find similar expressions but with @xmath54 replaced by @xmath55 and @xmath56 replaced by @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "in the previous section we saw that in principle the physical observables of a marginal tachyon profile are encoded in the boundary state .",
    "an interesting question is then to what extent can these properties be reproduced by an effective field theory for the tachyon .",
    "a reliable effective action formulation would facilitate more complicated calculations , such as the dynamics in the presence of evolving closed string modes .",
    "for example in @xcite sen showed that for time dependent tachyon solutions in a bi - type action the pressure does indeed vanish asymptotically .",
    "however , as we remarked in the introduction , this particular form for the effective action is not derived from string theory and one might therefore question the predictions obtained from it . in view of this",
    "we consider in this section the predictions of a rather general class of effective actions .",
    "typically , the full tachyon effective action will be non - local and thus difficult to handle . in",
    "what follows will consider effective actions which involve only first derivatives of the tachyon field .",
    "this class of actions includes , in particular , all suggestions which have appeared in the literature so far . for a non - bps brane",
    "it is known that the action and in particular the potential @xmath58 must be an even function of the tachyon field @xmath59 .",
    "therefore the most general form for the effective action of a real @xmath59 in @xmath60 dimensions that depends on at most first order derivatives and is even in @xmath59 is given by @xmath61 from noether s theorem it folows that for any static , codimension one solution of the equations of motion of an action of the type ( [ action ] ) will have the integral of motion @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a constant and @xmath59 depends only on @xmath13 . in addition",
    "the energy density @xmath64 is trivially conserved . for a time",
    "dependent but spatially homogeneous solutions one again finds two conserved quantities but now the conservation of energy leads to a non - trivial condition @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a constant .",
    "the simplest condition one may want to impose is that the effective action reproduces the correct perturbative tachyon mass near @xmath67 , that is @xmath68 .",
    "however this also illustrates one problem of trunctating to first derivative actions since integration by parts allows us to write the kinetic term as @xmath69 and it could therefore be modified by higher derivative terms .",
    "indeed several proposals for the effective action do not reproduce the correct tachyon mass .",
    "the next issue that we want to discuss is whether the marginal deformations in the last section can be solutions of a first derivative effective action . as shown in @xcite , the requirement that @xmath70 solves the field equations",
    "completely determines the general action ( [ action ] ) in terms of an arbitrary potential @xmath71 , i.e. @xmath72 where @xmath73 . evaluating the resulting kink equation ( [ kinkeq ] )",
    "one then finds @xmath74 thus , assuming that @xmath58 is nowhere constant , we see that the only regular static solutions are @xmath75 for arbitrary @xmath76 and @xmath30 .",
    "in addition it is easy to see that , by taking the limit @xmath77 , this condition also ensures that the correct perturbative mass for the tacyhon is reproduced .",
    "let us now look at the periodicity properties of the physical observables on marginal profiles .",
    "as discussed in section @xmath78 the stress tensor for marginal deformations is periodic in @xmath30 . for a space - like kink @xmath79 , periodicity of the conserved energy @xmath80 in @xmath30",
    "implies that @xmath81 is periodic in @xmath30 for all values in @xmath13 .",
    "this implies that @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is a periodic function . on the other hand periodicity of the conserved momentum",
    "@xmath29 implies that @xmath84 is periodic in @xmath30 .",
    "these two conditions are , however , incompatible .",
    "similar comments apply to the case of time - dependent solutions .",
    "thus , we conclude that while marginal deformations can be solutions of first derivative effective actions , the periodicity in @xmath30 of the all observables can not be reproduced by any first derivative effective action .",
    "this problem , which was also observed in @xcite , originates in the fact that the string ground state at @xmath85 is not the same as the string ground state in the new vacuum at @xmath86 due to spectral flow . therefore to see this periodicity the infinite tower of massive strings modes has to be taken into account .",
    "generally we then expect that while effective actions capture the physics near a given string theory vacuum , global properties are typically beyond such approximations .",
    "in particular we then expect that the effective action ( [ kv ] ) will only be reliable for @xmath87",
    ".    in superstring theory all of the tachyon effective actions proposed to date take the specific form @xmath88 certainly without some kind of simplifying structure even an action which has been truncated to be only first order in derivatives becomes intractable .",
    "therefore in what follows we restrict our attention to these forms for @xmath89 .",
    "we note here that an effective action of this form is compatible with t - duality if the transverse scalars and worldvolume vector fields are included as @xmath90 or in the bi form @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "sen s conjectures state that the potential is nowhere negative , vanishes in the true open string vacuum and has a maximum value of @xmath92 at @xmath67 .",
    "furthermore , there should be no perturbative open string excitations about the true vacuum .",
    "although one might think that action of the form ( [ ex1 ] ) would ensure this condition , this is not true in general . assuming that for small @xmath93 , @xmath94 we check the perturbative excitations around @xmath95 by introducing a new tachyon variable .",
    "@xmath96 the effective action now looks like @xmath97 note that this changes of variable relates the bi action @xcite to the proposal of @xcite . expanding ( [ lphi ] ) for @xmath98 (",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath99 ) leads to @xmath100 the mass - squared of elementary excitations around the tachyon vacuum is then given by @xmath101 the absence of perturbative excitations implies that this mass is infinite .",
    "it is not hard to convince oneself that @xmath102 will be infinite provided that @xmath58 vanishes faster than @xmath103 if the minimum is at infinite @xmath59 , or faster than @xmath104 if the minimum is at a finite value of @xmath59 .",
    "note that @xmath103 appears in the effective action of a d - brane in _ bosonic _ string theory .",
    "however the effective actions of bosonic bsft @xcite do not have the form ( [ ex1 ] ) and hence ( [ mass ] ) does not apply . indeed one can check that the resulting mass in these cases is infinite .",
    "nevertheless , even if the form ( [ ex1 ] ) is assumed , plane - wave excitations for @xmath105 are absent due to non - linearities in the kinetic term @xcite .",
    "it has also been pointed out that the hamiltonian formalism is in fact better suited for analysing the dynamics in the true vacuum @xcite .",
    "however this can not be done here without choosing a specific form for @xmath106 .",
    "another requirement that the effective action should satisfy is that it should reproduce the correct tension for kink solutions which are identified with a bps d@xmath107-brane .",
    "more generally if @xmath108 is an off - shell profile then @xmath109 in the infra - red limit .",
    "the worldsheet theory is expected to run to that of @xmath110 bps d@xmath107-branes and anti - d@xmath107-branes . here",
    "@xmath110 is the number of times @xmath59 interpolates between the vacua as @xmath109 .",
    "since this should be true for all profiles this suggest that at large @xmath111 , _",
    "i.e. _ at large @xmath112 , the action becomes topological .",
    "this will be the case if @xmath113 as @xmath114 .",
    "recall that we normalise @xmath115 and @xmath116 so that @xmath117 is not arbitrary . in this case",
    "the energy for the profile @xmath108 is , in the limit @xmath109 , @xmath118 it is not hard to see that this property is indeed shared by all non - linear , first derivative superstring tachyon actions proposed thus far @xcite .",
    "it was also pointed out in @xcite that a square - root form for time independent configurations is needed to ensure that the fluctuations about a kink background have finite masses .",
    "a square - root form also ensures that the effective action for the relative centre of mass coordinates of the d@xmath107-branes has a bi form @xcite .",
    "in addition , to agree with the interpretation as @xmath110 seperate bps d@xmath107-branes and anti - d@xmath107-branes this energy should be @xmath119 .",
    "hence we find a constraint on the area of the potential between two minima and the large @xmath120 behaviour of @xmath106 .",
    "this condition is indeed satisfied by the proposals of @xcite .",
    "lastly we consider the asymptotic form of the pressure for homogenous , time - dependent tachyon approaching the minimum of the potential .",
    "we then have for the conserved energy @xmath121 while the pressure is given by @xmath122 because @xmath123 vanishes at its minimum , energy conservation implies that @xmath124 necessarily approaches a singular point of @xmath125 or @xmath106 as @xmath59 condenses to @xmath95 .",
    "now if this singularity is at some finite value of @xmath126 then , since @xmath125 will diverge faster than @xmath106 , the first term in ( [ e ] ) will dominate and the second term will vanish . therefore @xmath7 must also approach zero at this point",
    ". if the singular point of @xmath106 or @xmath125 is at infinity then @xmath7 vanishes unless @xmath127 and @xmath128 have the same asymptotic behaviour ; that is if @xmath129 as @xmath130 . in this latter case , as @xmath131 , @xmath132 is non - vanishing .",
    "thus , unless @xmath128 has a power law behaviour for rapidly varying time dependent tachyons , the pressure vanishes as the tachyon condenses .",
    "although whether or not this happens exponentially quickly or not will depend on the choice of @xmath106 .",
    "in the previous section we outlined various properties that the effective action for the tachyonic mode of a non - bps d - brane is expected to have . in particular",
    "if we require that the marginal deformations ( [ marginal ] ) are solutions to the equations of motion then the effective action is uniquely determined by a choice of potential @xmath123 . as proposed in @xcite , to fix this ambiguity we take the exact potential found in boundary string field theory @xcite @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the tension of a bps @xmath4-brane .",
    "the resulting lagrangian that we construct then takes the form @xcite",
    "@xmath135   \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can then check that this action satisfies all the properties discussed in the previous section ( with the exception of periodicity which we argued could not be captured by any first derivative effective action ) .    for static configurations",
    "this action is in remarkable agreement with the bsft action @xcite @xmath136 this is somewhat surprising since the bsft action is derived by simply assuming a linear tachyon profile .",
    "this good agreement can be viewed as a test of the bsft action for non - trivial space - like kinks , since these are solutions to the equations of motion of ( [ kinkyaction ] ) . however , for time - like solutions the two actions differ considerably . in particular , while ( [ kinkyaction ] ) is smooth for all @xmath137 the bsft action has poles at negative integer values of @xmath120 .",
    "however there is no reason to believe that these poles are physically important since the bsft action is derived for linear profiles but these are not solutions to the equations of motion . furthermore , the fact that the action ( [ kinkyaction ] ) and the bsft action differ substantially for time dependent solutions suggests that , in contrast to space - like marginal profiles , the bsft effective action can not be trusted . the action ( [ kinkyaction ] ) also agrees well with the bi form @xcite @xmath138 for @xmath139 if we take @xmath140",
    ". however again they differ substantially for time dependent profiles where @xmath141 and therefore similar comments apply .",
    "in particular the bi form imposes a maximum value of @xmath142 .",
    "these three forms for the function @xmath106 are plotted in figure @xmath0 .    from the construction of the effective action in the last section it is clear that @xmath143 is an exact solution of the equation of motion .",
    "in fact we can say more by analysing the energy momentum tensor for the action ( [ kinkyaction ] ) @xmath144 \\ .\\ ] ] let us now consider a homogenous , but otherwise arbitrary , time dependent tachyon configuration .",
    "then the energy takes the simple form @xmath145 conservation of energy then implies that ( [ tsol ] ) is the only regular solution of the equation of motion . of course , the same result can be obtained by analytic continuation from ( [ sugg ] ) . in particular , as the tachyon rolls to the minimum @xmath126 diverges in agreement with the conformal field theory approach .",
    "this is in contrast with the bi - type and bsft actions where @xmath126 approaches a constant @xcite .",
    "let us now consider @xmath146 .",
    "from ( [ tmunu ] ) we have @xmath147 now , for large @xmath93 , @xmath148 so that @xmath149 thus , the action ( [ kinkyaction ] ) predicts that at large times the tachyon condensation produces a gas with non vanishing energy and vanishing pressure .",
    "in particular for large @xmath150 , where @xmath151 , @xmath152 this exponential fall - off agrees exactly with the string theory result from the boundary state @xcite . note that this prediction is different from that obtained using the bsft effective action @xcite , where the square of @xmath153 appears in the exponential .",
    "one can also see that the bi - form @xmath154 with the potential ( [ vbsft ] ) predicts that @xmath155 appears in the exponential .",
    "in addition for @xmath87 we find the same dependence of @xmath7 and @xmath156 on @xmath30 as predicted from the boundary state ( [ p ] ) . on the other hand , in the boundary state approach ,",
    "the pressure is always negative , whereas here we find that the pressure approaches zero from above ( see figure @xmath78 ) .",
    "the same phenomenon was also observed in @xcite for the bsft effective action .",
    "indeed it is clear from ( [ p ] ) that the sign of the pressure as @xmath131 is the opposite of the sign of @xmath157 , which is negative in bsft and ( [ kinkyaction ] ) , but positive for a bi - type action .",
    "there one of the speculations was that this difference could be due to the fact that the solution of the bsft differ from the exact marginal deformations .",
    "this possibility can be excluded here as the solutions to our action are precisely the marginal deformations .",
    "although higher derivative terms could lead to corrections in our action as well .    finally we make some comments on the interpretation of these solutions . for the static solutions @xmath158 the energy density is not spatially homogeneous but is peaked about @xmath159 for integer @xmath160 , becoming more sharply peaked as @xmath161 . however , by construction the action ( [ kv ] ) is independent of @xmath30 and therefore the total energy , evaluated over a single period @xmath162 , is @xmath163 for all @xmath30 . for @xmath86",
    "this represents a configuration of bps d@xmath107-branes at each odd @xmath160 and anti - d@xmath107 branes at each even @xmath160 .",
    "the interpretation of other values of @xmath30 is less clear , however these are no longer marginal deformations once string loop corrections are considered @xcite . of course , the solutions involving the marginal deformation @xmath164 can be obtained from the previous ones by translation along @xmath13 .    for time dependent solutions the energy density , @xmath165 , is spatially homogeneous . in particular for @xmath166 we have @xmath167 , which is less than the false vacuum energy density , while for @xmath168 the energy density @xmath169 is greater than the false vacuum energy density .",
    "these solutions are no longer related by temporal or spatial translation .",
    "indeed while both solutions start and end in the vacuum as @xmath170 the @xmath171 solutions never pass over the energy barrier at @xmath67 whereas the @xmath172 solutions travel from one vacuum to the other . as we discussed in section 2 , in the full string theory",
    "there is a periodic dependence on @xmath30 for the @xmath43 solutions but not for the @xmath53 solutions .",
    "the relevance of scalar field action with higher than quadratic derivative terms for cosmology has been recognised a while ago @xcite , where it was argued that scalar field actions of the form @xmath173 can produce inflationary scenarios ( k - inflation ) as well as late stage cosmological acceleration ( k - essence ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting to analyse our tachyon action from this point of view .",
    "related analysis were carried out in @xcite for the bi - type and bsft effective actions .",
    "we consider a general first derivative effective action of the form ( [ ex1 ] ) minimally coupled to gravity @xmath174 in @xmath175 dimensions and with @xmath59 assumed to be spatially homogeneous and time dependent the metric then takes the usual frw form @xmath176 where @xmath177 is a spatial manifold with constant curvature @xmath24 . for simplicity",
    "we consider the spatially flat case @xmath178 .",
    "a convenient set of evolution equations is then simply ( recall that one of einstein s equations is not independent ) @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the hubble constant and @xmath165 and @xmath7 are the energy density and pressure , respectively .",
    "if we now substitute our tachyon action these general formulae become @xmath181 in particular at late times @xmath182 and we can approximate @xmath183 so that @xmath184 . hence we see that @xmath185 for a constant @xmath186 and therefore @xmath187 thus the outcome of this analysis is identical with that obtained in @xcite for the bi action and describes matter dominated expansion .    for intermediate times",
    "it is convenient to consider the master equation @xmath188 from figure @xmath78 we then see that the evolution starts off with an inflationary phase @xmath189 and then transforming smoothly into a matter dominated expansion ( [ mex ] ) for late times .",
    "this qualitative behaviour is the same as found in @xcite for the bsft action .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the general properties of first derivative tachyon effective actions .",
    "for example we showed that the asymptotic vanishing of the pressure for time - dependent tachyon profiles is relatively generic , although the details vary . on the other hand we argued that the periodicity of the stress tensor under marginal deformations can not be reproduced by any first derivative effective action .",
    "we also studied in detail the first derivative effective action that we proposed in @xcite and showed that it reproduces many of the expected features of tachyon dynamics , including several correct quantitative features .",
    "however , it seems appropriate to mention the more pessimistic note that one could interpret the large discrepancies among the various proposed effective actions for time dependent tachyons , compared with their striking similarity for static profiles , as an indication that the effective action approach will not be as successful in the time dependent case .",
    "indeed it has recently been observed from the boundary state that time dependent tachyons also couple to massive closed string fields with an exponentially increasing strength @xcite , so that the truncation to low level string modes is potentially artificial .",
