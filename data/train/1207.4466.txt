    "it is a prediction of the concordance cold - dark - matter cosmological model that galaxies and galaxy clusters are surrounded by a massive dark matter ( dm ) haloes .",
    "firm evidence for the dm existence is coming from various gravitational effects in astrophysics and cosmology @xcite .",
    "if the existing cosmological dm @xcite is a thermal relic consisting of weakly interacting massive particles , dm annihilations into the standard model particles should provide indirect evidence of dm in cosmic ray experiments @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the direct @xcite and indirect @xcite searches for dm particles have all given either negative or contradictory results .",
    "a notable exception to this result is the recent evidence for @xmath1-ray excess with energy 130  gev @xcite in the fermi large area telescope ( lat ) @xcite data .",
    "this excess originates predominately from a small region in the galactic centre @xcite and may have a double peak structure @xcite .",
    "its global statistical significance is between @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite , depending whether one or two peaks are fitted , and it is consistent with the fermi - lat bound on monochromatic photon lines from diffuse @xmath1-ray data @xcite .",
    "although galactic background effects make statistical fluctuation in the @xmath1-ray spectrum more likely than naively expected @xcite , the presence of a double peak in the background is very unlikely .",
    "although an option that the 130  gev @xmath1-ray excess is a fake detector effect is not entirely excluded , recent studies disfavour this possibility @xcite .",
    "it is likely that fermi - lat has either observed an astrophysical process that unexpectedly gives photon peak(s ) or detected the dm annihilations into monochromatic photons .    to verify that the dm has been discovered indirectly ,",
    "the @xmath1-ray excess must either be confirmed by other experiments such as the planned high - resolution experiments or , or to observe the same excess with fermi - lat from other known dm dominated objects .",
    "the expected signal from nearby dwarf galaxies turned out to be too weak to check the 130  gev @xmath1-ray excess with fermi - lat @xcite .",
    "however , the galaxy clusters , the biggest nearby cosmological structures dominated by dm , are expected to be much better objects for that purpose @xcite because the dm annihilation signal from there should be amplified by a boost factor due to the existence of many dm subhaloes @xcite .",
    "there are large uncertainties in theoretical predictions of the boost factors @xcite , numerical estimates vary from 10 to 10000 .",
    "experimental measurements are needed to discriminate between the different subhalo models .    here",
    "we report on searches for spectral features in fermi - lat @xmath1-rays from regions corresponding to nearby galaxy clusters determined by the magnitude of their signal line - of - sight integrals ( @xmath4-factors ) .",
    "we observe a double peak - like excess at photon energies 110  gev and 130  gev over the diffuse power - law background with statistical significance up to @xmath0 , confirming independently the earlier claims of excess from the galactic centre . interpreting this result as a signal of dm annihilations into two channels with monochromatic final - state photons , and fixing the annihilation cross section from galactic centre data ,",
    "we determine the annihilation boost factor due to galaxy cluster subhaloes .",
    "in this work we search for spectral features in the @xmath1-ray spectrum originating from the known galaxy clusters in fermi - lat data . for that , we work with a set of galaxy clusters which parameters are reliably known in the literature .",
    "we compute their @xmath4-factors according to @xcite that allows us to select clusters according to their expected contribution to the dm annihilation signal .",
    "coordinates , masses , distances and radii for the 18 galaxy clusters with largest @xmath4-factors are collected in table  [ tab1 ] . because of limited statistics we can not study signal from every cluster individually .",
    "instead we sum up all the photons coming from the directions of these clusters and study the spectrum of stacked flux .",
    "current determinations of the galaxy cluster dm halo parameters suffer from large uncertainties . despite of",
    "that we do observe a correlation between the @xmath4-factors of the galaxy clusters and the number of signal photons from them ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : jfactor ] ) , supporting our claim that the signal originates from galaxy clusters .",
    "we reanalyse the galactic centre excess with new lat resolution and find the double peak in the same position , supporting our claim that the two spectra both signal dm annihilations . assuming this , we determine the dm annihilation boost factor in galaxy clusters from fermi lat data .    in the present analysis we consider the public fermi - lat photon event data of 218 weeks within energy region from 20 to 300  gev .",
    "we apply the quality - filter cuts , as recommended by the fermi - lat team , as we did in our previous study @xcite .",
    "we make use of the events selection ( pass  7 version  6 ) , in order to minimise potential systematical errors .",
    "the selection of events as well as the calculation of exposure maps is performed using the fermi .",
    "the most important improvement compared to our previous work @xcite is the usage of new improved fermi - lat energy resolution @xcite .    to avoid effects of point sources we exclude photons that are within an energy - independent cut radius of each source .",
    "we used all 1873 sources from the lat 2-year point source catalog @xcite .",
    "the cut radius is chosen to be 0.2@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we also tested the radii 0@xmath5 , 0.15@xmath5 , 0.25@xmath5 and 0.5@xmath5 and find no effect on the final result .",
    "to estimate the photon spectrum related to the clusters we select photons that are within an energy independent radii around the centre of each cluster",
    ". we will denote it as the region of interest ( roi ) below .",
    "the annihilation signal should arise predominantly within @xmath6 in each cluster .",
    "the boosting effect due to halo substructures should make the signal spatially flat @xcite .",
    "the morphology of expected signal from a single main halo without substructure should be very different : it should arise from a small central region and must have very cuspy nature @xcite . however , in order to determine the stability signal significance over background , we need to consider larger and different regions than @xmath7 around clusters .",
    "we studied both the radii @xmath7 dependent and independent rois around the clusters .",
    "we found that the result is independent of how the background photons are included  signal peaks are not affected while the background fluctuates within estimated errors .",
    "thus the simplest choice of roi is the equal radii for all clusters .",
    "we considered radii @xmath8 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 8 degrees for roi and found that starting from smaller values of @xmath9 , at @xmath10 the significance reached maximal value and remained stable for larger radii .",
    "we also found that galaxy clusters with small @xmath4-factors mostly contribute to the background reducing the signal background ratio .",
    "starting from smaller number of clusters , the significance reached the maximum at 5@xmath117 clusters and remained stable beyond that . for numerical results",
    "we therefore consider only the 18 most relevant galaxy clusters presented in table  [ tab1 ] .    to compute the @xmath1-spectrum we sum up all photons from the selected cluster regions .",
    "the spectrum is calculated by the kernel smoothing as described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the characteristic kernel size is chosen based on the fermi - lat energy respond function .",
    "we calculated the spectrum in logarithmic and linear energy scales and used different kernel functions and sizes .",
    "the results are rather insensitive to the exact kernel function and size , showing that this kernel smoothing method is rather robust .    to estimate the signal significance we select @xmath12 random cluster - size regions in sky and find the @xmath1-spectrum for them . to avoid the crowded region at the galactic plane and centre of the galaxy we exclude the region @xmath13 from the study @xcite .",
    "it means the border of a randomly selected region can not be closer to the galactic plane than @xmath14 .",
    "we tested different sizes of the excluded regions : @xmath15 5 , 10 and 15 degrees having neglectable effect on results . for significance estimation of the spectral features we repeat the procedure 100,000 times for all the selected cases of radii to get the distribution of spectra .",
    "based on the 100,000 monte carlo realisations we estimated the confidence limits of the spectra .    to estimate the boost factor",
    ", we use the relation between the number of signal photons @xmath16 within solid angle @xmath17 and the properties of dm particle : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the exposure of cluster region @xmath17 , @xmath20 is the averaged cross - section , @xmath21 is the mass of dm particle and @xmath22 is the number of produced photons per annihilation ( in case of non - self - conjugated particle there is addition factor two in front of @xmath21 ) .",
    "the @xmath4-factor @xmath23 is defined by the line - of - sight integral @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the density profile of dm in galaxy cluster .",
    "the parameters of the main dm halo is considered from @xcite .",
    "we take the annihilation cross - section to photons to be @xmath26 , where @xmath27 @xmath28 s@xmath29 is the standard thermal cross - section , as computed from the @xmath1-ray line signal from the galactic centre @xcite .",
    "fig .  [ fig1 ] shows the measured spectrum of @xmath30 galaxy clusters for two choices of fixed radii , @xmath31 and @xmath32 together with the 95% cl background estimated with monte carlo ( grey band ) . reduced signal from the galactic centre",
    "is also presented for comparison . due to the improved energy resolution ( smaller smoothing kernel )",
    "we observe double peak structure in both spectra .",
    "the first peak is at 110  gev and the second at 130  gev , consistently with two dm annihilation channels to @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively .",
    "this is consistent with a generic prediction of gauge theories .",
    "looking for the double - peak excess with at least the same strenght as observed lines ( 110  gev and  130 gev ) in the whole mc sample and energy region ( 20  300  gev ) implies the global significance of the double - peak signal with @xmath0 .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] presents the number of photons in the signal region divided into 5  gev energy bins for different angular regions around the galaxy clusters .",
    "we see that the photons are clustered around two energies ( 110 and 130  gev ) corresponding to the two peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for larger values of considered",
    "radii the statistics increases , giving an optimal signal - over - background ratio for @xmath10 regions . for larger radii , such as @xmath35",
    ", we observe slight reduction of the signal significance , probably due to a fact the background starts dominating and it is not stable for so large roi .    assuming that the signal originates from dm annihilation",
    ", we estimate the boost factor due to dm substructures in the galaxy cluster . if this assumption is correct , this is the first real measurement of the boost factor from experimental data .    considering the radius @xmath36 ,",
    "the boost factor of substructure turns out to be @xmath37 at 68% cl , where the variation is estimated with bootstrap analysis .",
    "the error are very large and we note that this error is only statistical . in addition , other sources of error , the distance and mass of clusters , averaging over the selected clusters , the main dm profile of the clusters etc . , are not taken into account .",
    "in addition , the measured value of dm annihilation cross section to the photon channels in the galactic centre , @xmath26 , depends on uncertainties of the galactic dm halo and it has accuracy in order of magnitude . taking into account all those uncertainties , the present experimental precision does not allow to determine the boost factor numerically with a meaningful statistical significance . in order to distinguish between different dm subhalo models ,",
    "new more precise measurements are needed .",
    "we stress that the presence of double - peak feature in fermi lat data are not affected by this uncertainties .",
    "the galaxy clusters , as well as the galactic centre , are fixed objects dominated by dm , thus our result does not suffer from statistical fluctuations related to scanning and choosing arbitrary regions of the sky , nor from possible astrophysical effects from the galactic disc .",
    "the fact that the two signals from unrelated regions of sky , from the galactic centre and from the locations of galaxy clusters , give a double peak - like excesses that precisely coincide ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) suggests that this is not a statistical fluctuation .",
    "this result disfavours astrophysical explanation to the excess since astrophysical processes should not be exactly the same in galaxy clusters and in the galactic centre .",
    "our result implies that most plausibly the dm of universe has been discovered via indirect detection by fermi - lat .",
    "we have found that fermi - lat data shows a double peak - like excess of @xmath1-rays with energies 110  gev and 130  gev from the nearby galaxy clusters .",
    "the maximal global significance of the excess is @xmath0 .",
    "our result provides an _ independent _ confirmation of the previously claimed @xmath1-ray excess from the galactic centre and supports the interpretation of the excess due to dm annihilations into two monochromatic photon channels . making this assumption , and fixing the dm annihilation cross section from the galactic centre data",
    ", we found the boost factor for dm annihilations due to dm substructures in the galaxy cluster from fermi - lat data .",
    "this is the first measurement of dm boost factor from real data and has potentially important implications for understanding the dm substructures in haloes .",
    "unfortunately the related uncertainties at present are quite large .",
    "more data is needed to discriminate between different theoretical models of dm substructure as well as to discriminate the dm interpretation of the excess from the possible astrophysical origin and systematic detector effects .",
