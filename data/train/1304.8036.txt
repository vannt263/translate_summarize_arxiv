    "in 1881 , newcomb @xcite noticed that the first digit distribution of numerical data is not uniform but rather logarithmic .",
    "he had observed that the pages of logarithm tables were more worn out for smaller digits such as @xmath1 and @xmath2 than for larger ones , and concluded that `` [ the ] law of probability of the occurrence of the numbers is such that all mantissae of their logarithms are equally probable . ''",
    "he explicitly tabulated the probability of occurrence of the first and second digits .",
    "apparently unaware of newcomb s results , in 1938 , benford @xcite found the same first digit phenomenon , and explicitly gave the formula for the probability of a number having the first digit @xmath3 , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is used to represent the base @xmath6 logarithm .",
    "he gathered empirical evidence for formula ( [ eq : ben ] ) by collecting thousands of numbers from diverse datasets , such as the area of the riverbeds , atomic weights of elements , etc .",
    "it has been shown ( see for example @xcite ) that the only non - trivial digit distribution that is left invariant under scale change of the underlying distribution is the benford distribution .",
    "scale - invariance means that a collection of data has the same digit distribution when multiplied by a constant . in his seminal paper @xcite",
    ", hill showed that the appropriate domain for the significant digit probability is the smallest collection of positive real subsets that contains all the infinite sets of the form @xmath7 .",
    "this set denoted by @xmath8 , is the smallest sigma algebra generated by @xmath9 , @xmath10 ,  , where @xmath11 is the @xmath12-th significant - digit function .",

    "al @xcite investigated several examples of symmetric and non - symmetric distributions that lead to benford distributed random variables .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ mod1 ] ,",
    "we use the mod 1 map to show that the well - known base- and scale - invariance of benford distributed random variables are consequences of @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the associated density function . in section [ nben ]",
    ", we introduce the concept of @xmath0-digit benford distributed random variables which are guaranteed to obey the log distribution in their first @xmath0 digits , and give a general construction method for such variables .",
    "unless otherwise specified , throughout this paper , we assume that the base is @xmath6 .",
    "any positive real number @xmath32 can be written as @xmath33 for some @xmath34 , where @xmath35",
    ". then the first digits of @xmath32 and @xmath36 are the same : @xmath37 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath32 is given by a random variable @xmath19 with the density function @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath39 be the random variable with the density function @xmath40 .    for any real function @xmath41",
    ", we define @xmath42 as @xmath43    [ l : one ] [ dagger ] the probability of @xmath44 having its first digit @xmath3 is @xmath45    let us consider the real numbers starting with the digit @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath46 .",
    "these numbers belong to the set @xmath47 now consider the random variable @xmath39 with the density function @xmath40 .",
    "the logarithmic function maps @xmath48 into @xmath49 .",
    "this set modulo @xmath1 is just @xmath50 as illustrated in figure ( [ f : mod1 ] ) for the case @xmath51 .",
    ".,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    consequently @xmath52    clearly , if @xmath30 , then one obtains benford s law @xmath53 .",
    "the uniformity of @xmath31 resonates with newcomb s pioneering observation in 1881 @xcite that the `` probability of the occurrence of the numbers is such that all mantissae of their logarithms are equally probable . ''",
    "lemma [ l : one ] can be readily generalized for the probability of a sequence of prescribed digits @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 : @xmath58      scale - invariance means that a collection of data does not change its digit distribution when multiplied by a constant .",
    "for example , suppose that the prices of goods are benford distributed , then scale - invariance implies that these prices remain benford distributed regardless of the currency in which they are converted .",
    "[ l : scale - tr ] scaling of a random variable @xmath19 is equivalent to a translation of @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath60 be a random variable with the density function @xmath40 and let @xmath61 be the random variable generated by the translation of @xmath60 by @xmath62 units , i.e. , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the density function of @xmath61 .",
    "define @xmath66 and @xmath67 and let @xmath38 and @xmath68 be their corresponding density functions . in terms of cumulative distribution functions , we have @xmath69 the converse is immediate .",
    "due to modular arithmetics , a translation of @xmath40 will result in a wrap - around effect in @xmath31 .",
    "hence , scaling of @xmath19 induces a wrap - around of @xmath31 .",
    "for example , let @xmath70 be the random variable with the density function @xmath71 , and let @xmath61 be its translation by @xmath62 .",
    "the effect of scaling of @xmath19 on @xmath31 is shown in figure ( [ f : wrap ] ) .",
    "of a translation by t=0.65 of the @xmath71.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    by lemma ( [ dagger ] ) , we observe that @xmath72 , i.e. , the first digit distributions of @xmath19 and @xmath73 are not the same , indicating that @xmath19 is not scale - invariant .",
    "one can see that only a uniform @xmath31 remains unchanged under the wrap - around effect induced by a scaling of @xmath19 .",
    "[ t : ben - scale ] only the random variables characterized by @xmath74 are scale - invariant .",
    "by lemma ( [ l : scale - tr ] ) , scaling of @xmath19 yields a wrap - around effect of @xmath31 . for a benford distribution ,",
    "we want the same areas under the @xmath31 and @xmath75 over the intervals @xmath76 @xmath77 . here",
    "@xmath75 denotes the mod 1 projection of @xmath65 which is the shifted @xmath40 .",
    "clearly , a uniform @xmath31 will satisfy this constraint . any other function when translated by an arbitrary amount , will not simultaneously keep the areas under @xmath31 preserved over all of these intervals .",
    "thus , the only @xmath31 left unchanged under all translations is the uniform one .",
    "we are now arriving at two important results first proved by hill @xcite concerning scale- and base - invariance .",
    "scale - invariance implies benford s law .    in order to have scale - invariance , we must have @xmath74 . from lemma ( [ dagger ] ) ,",
    "one obtains benford s law .",
    "base - invariance means that for any base @xmath78 , the probability of having @xmath3 as the first digit is @xmath79    scale - invariance implies base - invariance .",
    "scale - invariance requires @xmath74 .",
    "then , for an arbitrary base @xmath78 , integrating over the logarithmic intervals @xmath80 , we get benford s distribution @xmath81    using the insight gained by the mod 1 map analysis , we can construct an infinite class of benford distributed random variables with non - compact support .",
    "to this end , let us consider @xmath60 with the following density function @xmath82,\\ ] ] as illustrated in figure [ f : series ] .     with non - compact support yielding uniform @xmath31.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    here",
    "@xmath83 is the heaviside step function . since the series @xmath84 , one obtains @xmath30 and thus , @xmath66 is benford distributed .",
    "a similar construction can be used for any convergent series .",
    "we define a random variable that has a logarithmic distribution in its first @xmath0 digits to be a @xmath0-digit benford variable .",
    "more precisely , such a variable is benford in the first @xmath0 digits , but it is not guaranteed to have a logarithmic distribution beyond the @xmath0-th digit .",
    "let @xmath85 .",
    "a random variable is @xmath0-digit benford if for all @xmath22 and all @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88    to show that such variables exist , we use ( [ e : five ] ) to construct a @xmath31 that satisfies ( [ e : benf ] ) for any @xmath85 .",
    "that is , we search for @xmath31 such that @xmath89    we proceed by the partition @xmath90 of the @xmath91 interval . then an example of @xmath31 which yields a @xmath1-digit benford distribution is given by @xmath92 as illustrated in figure [ f : sine ] .     yielding a @xmath1-digit benford random variable.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "one can readily check that @xmath93 .    by theorem ( [ t : ben - scale ] ) any density function @xmath40 whose @xmath31 is non - uniform is not scale - invariant .",
    "thus the example of equation ( [ e : non - u ] ) while yielding a @xmath1-digit benford distributed variable , is not scale- nor base - invariant .    following this idea , one can generalize the example given in ( [ e : non - u ] ) in order to produce a @xmath31 which satisfy ( [ e : star ] ) with an arbitrary large @xmath0 .",
    "for such a construction , let @xmath94 be a partition of the interval @xmath91 .",
    "let @xmath95 \\to [ 0,\\infty)$ ] be a probability density function .",
    "for @xmath96 such that @xmath97 , let us define @xmath98 it is easy to see that for all @xmath99 , @xmath100 therefore , we have that @xmath31 behaves as the uniform density ( @xmath101 for all @xmath102 ) when integrated over intervals of the form @xmath103 with @xmath104 .",
    "using mathematica @xcite , we modeled a 1-digit benford random variable by generating its discrete approximation with @xmath105 data points . as a concrete example we took @xmath66 where @xmath60 has the density function @xmath106 given by ( [ e : non - u ] ) . from @xmath107",
