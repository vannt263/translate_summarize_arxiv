    "an ability to produce more then one electron - hole pairs ( excitons ) per single absorbed photon in semiconductor materials can potentially enhance the solar energy conversion efficiency in photovoltaic devices beyond the fundamental shockley - queisser limit.@xcite in the literature this process is referred to as carrier multiplication ( cm ) or multiple exciton generation , and has been extensively studied in the _ bulk _",
    "semiconductors for decades.@xcite recent ultrafast optical studies of cm in semiconductor _ nanocrystals _ ( nc ) reported significantly higher qe and much lower activation energy threshold ( aet ) as compared to the bulk materials on the photon energy scale normalized by corresponding band gap values.@xcite    these reports stimulated extensive experimental and theoretical studies of the cm in the nanostructured materials in which the exciton dynamics is affected by the quantum confinement .",
    "it was initially expected that the quantum confinement enhancement of the coulomb interactions between the carriers could result in more efficient multi - exciton production .",
    "furthermore , a relaxation of the quasi - momentum conservation constrains by breaking the translational symmetry should open additional pathways for cm and reduce the aet .",
    "finally , the presence of the phonon bottleneck in ncs should slow down the intraband phonon - assisted cooling and further increase the qe .",
    "however , the subsequent reports claimed significantly lower qe and even the absence of the cm in ncs.@xcite this controversy possibly rises from experimental inaccuracy,@xcite sample - to - sample variation in surface preparation,@xcite and contribution from extraneous effects such as photocharging.@xcite the optical measurements of qe in bulk pbs and pbse semiconductors@xcite show that , in fact , the _ bulk _ qe exceeds validated values in ncs@xcite if compared on the absolute photon energy scale .",
    "@xcite however , due to confinement induced increase in the band gap energy , @xmath0 , the benefits to photovoltaics is higher in ncs than in bulk .",
    "the controversy calls for development of new sensitive spectroscopic tools,@xcite alternative photo - current measurements,@xcite and the reassessment of the quantum confinement role in the cm dynamics based on a unified theoretical model.@xcite    accepted theoretical models of cm are based on the many - body coulomb interactions which correspond to the valence - conduction band transitions conserving the total charge but not the number of electrons and holes.@xcite in the exciton picture , this represents the transitions between the exciton bands of different multiplicity .",
    "hence , we will refer to these transitions below as the _ interband exciton transitions _ , and to the corresponding coulomb interactions as the _ interband coulomb interactions_. within adopted nomenclature , the _ intraband coulomb interactions _",
    "( i.e. , restricted to an exciton band of a certain multiplicity ) conserve the total number of electrons and holes and determine the multi - exciton interaction ( e.g. , binding ) energy .",
    "the simplest theoretical model initially developed to explain cm in bulk materials is the impact ionization ( ii ) model.@xcite it treats cm dynamics following high energy photoexcitation as the lowest order interband transitions whose rate is given by the fermi s golden rule .",
    "this rate depends on the interband coulomb matrix elements and the final multiple - carriers ( e.g. , biexciton ) density of states ( dos).@xcite the model has been further applied to interpret the cm dynamics in ncs along with various methods for the electronic structure calculations .",
    "franceschetti , an and zunger performed atomistic pseudopotential calculations of the ii and auger recombination rates in a pbse nc . assuming the absence of the quasi - momentum constraint and rapid growth of the biexciton dos , they estimated low value ( @xmath1 ) of aet defining this quantity as the energy above which the ii rate exceeds the auger recombination one.@xcite rabani and baer performed screened semiempirical pseudopotential calculations of the ii rates in cdse and inas and found significant reduction of the qe with the ncs size increase .",
    "observed trend makes cm already inefficient in ncs of diameter @xmath2  nm .",
    "the observation has been rationalized by strong size dependence of the interband coulomb interactions and the trion dos behavior.@xcite    using the semiempirical tight binding model allan and delerue performed extensive calculations for pbse and pbse , inas and si ncs.@xcite they found that although the coulomb interactions are enhanced by the quantum confinement , the quantum - confinement - induced reduction in the biexciton dos facilitates the _ reduction _ of the ii rate and subsequently of qe .",
    "the comparison of the ii rates calculated in pbse bulk and pbse ncs shows that the ii rates in the ncs does not exceed the bulk one.@xcite based on these calculations , the authors of ref .",
    "[ ] argue that the experimentally observed drop of qe in ncs can be attributed to the dominant effect of the reduced carrier s dos .",
    "lack of the phonon bottleneck , leads to the rapid intraband phonon - assisted relaxation which further reduces the qe.@xcite    schaller , agranovich , and klimov , first pointed out that in addition to ii , the direct photogeneration of biexcitons can take place in ncs through  virtual - exciton channel\".@xcite subsequently , rupasov and klimov suggested that additional contribution to photogeneration qe can rise from the  vitual biexciton channel\".@xcite using the effective mass model for the electronic structure of pbs and pbse ncs due to kang and wise,@xcite the authors estimated the photogeneration qe and argued that this process dominates the cm dynamics in ncs .",
    "recently , silvestri and agranovich using the same model , performed detailed calculations for relatively small radii ( specifically for 1.95  nm and 3  nm ) pbse ncs.@xcite they concluded that the contribution of the photogeneration processes in ncs is much weaker than it was claimed before , and clarified that the overestimated qe results from disregarding the effect of selection rules for the interband coulomb matrix elements and the oscillator strength factors weighting optically allowed transitions . here , we demonstrate that the absence of the interference between the photogeneration pathways and the presence of small size dispersion further reduces the photogeneration qe .",
    "another model describing the _ coherent _ photogeneration of biexcitons from the resonant exciton states initially proposed by shabaev , efros , and nozik considered idealized five level system,@xcite and was subsequently refined to account for the biexciton dos effect.@xcite using the effective mass @xmath3 hamiltonian , the authors of ref .",
    "[ ] performed calculations for small radii ( i.e. , 2  nm and 3  nm ) pbse ncs , and found that dense biexciton dos leads to the vanishing coherent oscillations .",
    "they also pointed out that efficient cm can be expected in considered small ncs .",
    "the drawback of the coherent superposition model is the lack of the pure - dephasing effects and the inhomogeneous broadening which as we demonstrate here play important role in the cm dynamics reducing the qe .",
    "finally , the _ ab initio _",
    "calculations on small _ clusters _",
    "( @xmath4  nm ) demonstrated the role of strong coulomb correlations and fast exciton - biexciton dephasing in multiexciton photogeneration ,  @xcite and suggested contributions of the phonon - assisted auger processes to cm.@xcite the atomistic calculations mostly focused on ii dynamics occurring during the population relaxation are limited to the small diameter ( @xmath5  nm ) ncs .",
    "however , reported experimental studies consider larger ncs with the diameter varying up to 10  nm . to close this gap and to perform comparison with bulk ,",
    "an extrapolation procedure combined with atomistic calculations has been used.@xcite the photogeneration dynamics has been investigated using effective mass models for larger but still small diameter ( @xmath6  nm ) ncs .",
    "recently , we have published a letter summarizing the results of our numerical investigation on the direct photogeneration and population relaxation processes contributing to cm in a broad diameter range pbse ncs and in pbse bulk.@xcite the calculations employ our earlier proposed interband exciton scattering model ( iesm)@xcite which recovers the models discussed above as limiting cases and which we further parameterized using the effective mass , @xmath3 , electronic structure model proposed by kang and wise.@xcite@xmath7 in the letter , we argue that in both cases of the photogeneration and population relaxation the ii is the main mechanisms of cm .",
    "this explains weak contribution of the direct photogeneration to the total quantum qe .",
    "analyzing the scaling of the total qe with the nc size , we found that qe in ncs plotted on absolute energy scale does not exceed that in the bulk .",
    "this is in agreement with reported experimental data and some theoretical studies , and confirms that the quantum - confinement - induced reduction in the biexciton dos makes a dominant contribution to qe .",
    "present paper discusses in great details the theoretical method and provides extended analysis of the numerical results summarized in ref .",

    "they depend on the delay time measured from the center of the pump pulse and allow one to determine both the qe due to the photogeneration event and the total qe after the population relaxation .",
    "a complimentary quantity , often used to describe cm yield , is the biexciton quantum yield , @xmath11 , defined as a number of biexcitons produced per single absorbed photon .    in this section ,",

    "both of them have linear scaling with the volume in the bulk limit .",
