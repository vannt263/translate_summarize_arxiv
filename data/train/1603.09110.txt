    "parameterizing knots has been useful in estimating some important knot invariants such as bridge number @xcite , superbridge number @xcite and geometric degree @xcite .",
    "some of the interesting parameterizations are fourier knots @xcite , polygonal knots @xcite and polynomial knots @xcite .",
    "the first two of them provide classical knots , whereas the polynomial parametrization gives long knots . in each parametrization",
    "there is a positive integer @xmath0 associated to it . for fourier knots and polynomial knots",
    "it is its _ degree _ and for polygonal knots it is its _",
    "edge number_. for each parametrization , one can study the space of all parametrized knots for a fixed @xmath0 . once we fix @xmath0 , there will be only finitely many knots that can be parametrized with this @xmath0 .",
    "however , in the space of parameterizations , one could study the topology and try to see if two parametrized knots in this space belong to the same path components or not . in @xcite calvo studied the spaces of polygonal knots .",
    "we aim to study the topology of some spaces of polynomial knots . in @xcite vassiliev",
    "pointed out that the space of long knots can be approximated by the space of embeddings from @xmath9 to @xmath10 given by @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "he defined ( see @xcite ) the space @xmath13 to be the interior of the set of all polynomial embeddings in the space @xmath14 of all polynomial maps of the type @xmath15 .",
    "it was noted that if two polynomial knots belong to the same path component of @xmath13 then they represent the same knot type .",
    "it is felt that the converse of this may not be true .",
    "however , no counter example is known . regarding the topology of the space @xmath13",
    ", he showed that the space @xmath16 is contractible and the space @xmath17 is homology equivalent to @xmath18.0.1 mm later , durfee and oshea @xcite introduced a different space @xmath19 which is the space of all polynomial knots @xmath20 such that @xmath21 . if two polynomial knots are path equivalent in @xmath19 , then they are topologically equivalent .",
    "thus a space @xmath19 will have at least as many path components as many knot types can be represented in @xmath19 . in @xcite",
    "a group of undergraduate students proved that @xmath22 has at least @xmath23 path components corresponding to the unknot , the right hand trefoil and the left hand trefoil respectively . beyond this the topology of these spaces is not understood .",
    "also , it is not clear whether two topologically equivalent knots in this space necessarily belong to the same path component or not .",
    "composing a polynomial knot with a simple polynomial automorphism of @xmath24 can reduce the degree of two of the components and the resulting polynomial knot will be topologically equivalent to the earlier one . keeping this view in mind , we note that any polynomial knot given by @xmath20 , for @xmath1 , is topologically equivalent to a polynomial knot @xmath25 with @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this motivated us to study the topology of three interesting spaces namely : ( 1 ) the space @xmath2 of all polynomial knots @xmath25 with @xmath29 and @xmath28 , ( 2 ) the space @xmath3 of all polynomial knots @xmath30 with @xmath31 , and ( 3 ) the space @xmath4 of all polynomial knots @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 . using the theory of real semi algebraic sets ( see @xcite and @xcite )",
    "we ensure that these spaces must have finitely many path components .",
    "we show that for @xmath35 the spaces @xmath2 are of the same homotopy type as @xmath36 .",
    "we also prove that the spaces @xmath3 are path connected where as the spaces @xmath4 are not path connected . for the space @xmath4 , for @xmath1",
    ", we show that if two polynomial knots lie in the same path component then they are topologically equivalent and we provide a counter example that the converse is not true .",
