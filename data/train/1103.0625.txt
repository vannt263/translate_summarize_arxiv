    "the study of quantum correlations is a key issue in quantum information theory @xcite and quantum entanglement represents the indispensable physical resource for the description and performance of quantum information processing tasks , like quantum teleportation , cryptography , superdense coding and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "however , entanglement does not describe all the non - classical properties of quantum correlations .",
    "for instance , recent theoretical and experimental results indicate that some non - entangled mixed states can improve performance in some quantum computing tasks @xcite .",
    "zurek @xcite defined the quantum discord as a measure of quantum correlations which includes entanglement of bipartite systems and it can also exist in separable states . very recently , quantum discord was related with the problem of irreversibility of entanglement @xcite and an operational interpretation was given to quantum discord in terms on consumption of entanglement in an extended quantum state merging protocol @xcite .",
    "the total amount of correlations contained in a quantum state is given by the quantum mutual information which is equal to the sum of the quantum discord and classical correlations @xcite .",
    "in recent years there is an increasing interest in using nonclassical entangled states of continuous variable systems in applications of quantum information processing , communication and computation @xcite . a full characterization of the nonclassical properties of such states exists , at present , only for the class of gaussian states . in this special case there exist necessary and sufficient criteria of entanglement @xcite and quantitative entanglement measures @xcite . in quantum information theory of continuous variable systems , gaussian states , in particular two - mode gaussian states , play a key role since they can be easily created and controlled experimentally",
    ".    implementation of quantum communication and computation encounters the difficulty that any realistic quantum system can not be isolated and it always has to interact with its environment . quantum coherence and entanglement of quantum systems",
    "are inevitably influenced during their interaction with the external environment . as a result of the irreversible and uncontrollable phenomenon of quantum decoherence ,",
    "the purity and entanglement of quantum states are in most cases degraded .",
    "practically , compared with the discrete variable entangled states , the continuous variable entangled states may be more efficient because they are less affected by decoherence .",
    "due to the unavoidable interaction with the environment , any pure quantum state evolves into a mixed state and to describe realistically continuous variable quantum information processes it is necessary to take decoherence and dissipation into consideration .",
    "decoherence and dynamics of quantum entanglement in continuous variable open systems have been intensively studied in the last years @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study , in the framework of the theory of open systems based on completely positive quantum dynamical semigroups , the dynamics of the continuous variable quantum entanglement and quantum discord of a subsystem consisting of two uncoupled modes ( harmonic oscillators ) interacting with a common thermal environment .",
    "we are interested in discussing the correlation effect of the environment , therefore we assume that the two modes are independent , i.e. they do not interact directly",
    ". the initial state of the subsystem is taken of gaussian form and the evolution under the quantum dynamical semigroup assures the preservation in time of the gaussian form of the state .",
    "we have studied previously @xcite the evolution of the entanglement of two identical harmonic oscillators interacting with a general environment , characterized by general diffusion and dissipation coefficients .",
    "we obtained that , depending on the values of these coefficients , the state keeps for all times its initial type : separable or entangled . in other cases , entanglement generation , entanglement sudden death or a periodic collapse and revival of entanglement take place .",
    "in @xcite it was analyzed the non - markovian short - time - scale evolution of entanglement and quantum discord for initial two - mode squeezed thermal vacuum states of a system consisting of two identical and non - interacting harmonic oscillators coupled to either two independent bosonic baths or to a common bosonic bath . in the independent reservoirs case , it was observed the detrimental effect of the environment for these quantities . in the common reservoir case , for initial uncorrelated states , it was found that only quantum discord can be created via interaction with the bath , while entanglement remains absent .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we write the markovian master equation in the heisenberg representation for two uncoupled harmonic oscillators interacting with a general environment and give the general solution of the evolution equation for the covariance matrix , i.e. we derive the variances and covariances of coordinates and momenta corresponding to a generic two - mode gaussian state . by using the peres - simon necessary and sufficient condition for separability of two - mode gaussian states",
    "@xcite , we investigate in sec .",
    "3 the dynamics of entanglement for the considered subsystem . for all values of the temperature of the thermal reservoir , an initial separable gaussian",
    "state remains separable for all times .",
    "we analyze the time evolution of the logarithmic negativity , which characterizes the degree of entanglement of the quantum state , and show that in the case of an entangled initial gaussian state , entanglement suppression ( entanglement sudden death ) takes place , for non - zero temperatures of the environment . only for a zero temperature of the thermal bath the initial entangled state remains entangled for all finite times , but in the limit of infinite time it evolves asymptotically to an equilibrium state which is always separable .",
    "we analyze the time evolution of the gaussian quantum discord , which is a measure of all quantum correlations in the bipartite state , including entanglement , and show that quantum discord decays asymptotically in time under the effect of the thermal bath .",
    "this is contrast with the sudden death of entanglement . before the suppression of the entanglement ,",
    "the qualitative evolution of quantum discord is very similar to that of the entanglement .",
    "we describe also the time evolution of the degree of classical correlations and of quantum mutual information , which measures the total amount of correlations of the quantum system .",

    "@xmath81 for @xmath82 and @xmath83 for @xmath67 and this confirms the previous statement that the asymptotic state is always separable .",
    "the separability of quantum states has often been described as a property synonymous with the classicality .",
    "however , recent studies have shown that separable states , usually considered as being classically correlated , might also contain quantum correlations .",
    "quantum discord was introduced @xcite as a measure of all quantum correlations in a bipartite state , including  but not restricted to ",
    "quantum discord has been defined as the difference between two quantum analogues of classically equivalent expression of the mutual information , which is a measure of total correlations in a quantum state .",
    "for pure entangled states quantum discord coincides with the entropy of entanglement .",
    "quantum discord can be different from zero also for some mixed separable state and therefore the correlations in such separable states with positive discord are an indicator of quantumness . states with zero discord represent essentially a classical probability distribution embedded in a quantum system .",
    "for an arbitrary bipartite state @xmath84 the total correlations are expressed by quantum mutual information @xcite @xmath85 where @xmath86 represents the reduced density matrix of subsystem @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the von neumann entropy .",
