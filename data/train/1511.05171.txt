    "the possibility to obtain detailed information on extrasolar planets , using different techniques and methods , has revealed some unexpected properties that are still challenging astrophysicists .",
    "one of the very first was the discovery of jupiter - like planets on very tight orbits , which are labelled hot jupiters , and the corresponding inflation - mechanism problem ( @xcite , and references therein ) . to find the answers to this and other open questions , it is important to have a proper statistical sample of exoplanets , whose physical and orbital parameters are accurately measured .",
    "one class of extrasolar planets , those which transit their host stars , has lately seen a large increase in the number of its known members .",
    "this achievement has been possible thanks to systematic transit - survey large programs , performed both from ground ( hatnet : @xcite ; tres : @xcite ; xo : @xcite ; wasp : @xcite ; kelt : @xcite ; mearth : @xcite ; qes : @xcite ; hatsouth : @xcite ) , and from space ( corot : @xcite , _ kepler _ : @xcite ) .",
    "the great interest in transiting planets lies in the fact that it is possible to measure all their main orbital and physical parameters with standard astronomical techniques and instruments . from photometry",
    "we can estimate the period , the relative size of the planet and the orbital inclination , whilst precise spectroscopic measurements provide a lower limit for the mass of the planet ( but knowing the inclination from photometry the precise mass can be calculated ) and the eccentricity of its orbit .",
    "unveiling the bulk density of the planets allows the imposition of constraints on , or differentiation between , the diverse formation and migration theories which have been advanced ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    furthermore",
    ", transiting planets allow astronomers to investigate their atmospheric composition , when observed in transit or occultation phases ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , is also important to stress that , besides instrumental limitations , the characterisation of planets atmosphere is made difficult by the complexity of their nature .",
    "retrieving the atmospheric chemical composition may be hindered by the presence of clouds , resulting in a featureless spectrum ( e.g.  gj1214b , @xcite ) .    in this work",
    ", we focus on two transiting exoplanet systems : wasp-45 and wasp-46 . based on new photometric and spectroscopic data , we review their physical parameters and probe the atmospheres of their planets .",
    "wasp-45 is a planetary system discovered within the superwasp survey by @xcite ( a12 hereafter ) .",
    "the light curve of wasp-45 , shows a periodic dimming ( every @xmath5days ) due to the presence of a hot jupiter ( radius @xmath6 and mass @xmath7 ) that transits the stellar disc .",
    "the host ( mass of @xmath8 and radius of @xmath9 ) is a k2v star with a higher metallicity than the sun ( [ fe / h ] @xmath10 @xmath11 ) .",
    "the study of the caii h+k lines in the star s spectra revealed weak emission lines , which indicates a low chromospheric activity .",
    "wasp-46 is a g6v type star ( mass @xmath12 , radius @xmath13 and [ fe / h ] @xmath10 @xmath14 ) .",
    "a12 discovered a hot jupiter ( mass @xmath15 and radius @xmath16 ) that orbits the star every 1.430 days on a circular orbit .",
    "as in the case of wasp-45 , weak emission visible in the caii h+k lines indicates a low stellar activity .",
    "moreover , the wasp light curve shows a photometric modulation , which allowed the measurement of the rotation period of the star , and a gyrochronological age of the system of 1.4gyr . by observing the secondary eclipse of the planet",
    ", @xcite detected the emission from the day - side atmosphere finding brightness temperatures consistent with a low heat redistribution efficiency .",
    "a total of 29 light curves of 14 transit events of wasp-45b and wasp-46b , and five spectra of wasp-45 were obtained using four telescopes located at the eso la silla observatory , chile .",
    "the details of the photometric observations are reported in table[obslog ] .",
    "the photometric observations were all performed with the telescopes in auto - guided mode and out of focus to minimise the sources of noise and increase the signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) . by spreading the light of each single star on many more pixels of the ccd , it is then possible to utilise longer exposure times without incurring saturation .",
    "atmospheric variations , change in seeing , or tracking imprecision lead to changes in the position and/or size of the point spread function ( psf ) on the ccd and , according to the different response of each single pixel , spurious noise can be introduced in the signal . by obtaining a doughnut - shaped psf that covers a circular region with a diameter from roughly 15 to 30 pixels ,",
    "the small variations in position are averaged out and have a much lower effect on the photometric precision @xcite .",

    ", eulercam has been used intensively for photometric follow - up observations of planet candidates from the wasp survey ( e.g. @xcite ) , as well as for the atmospheric study of highly irradiated giant planets @xcite .",

    "one transit of wasp-46b was observed with the new technology telescope ( ntt ) on the 23 october 2011 .",
    "the telescope has a primary mirror of 3.58 m and is equipped with an active optics system . the efosc2 instrument ( eso faint object spectrograph and camera 2 ) , mounted on its nasmythb focus , was utilised . the field of view of its loral / lesser camera is @xmath32 with a resolution of 0.12 arcsec per pixel . during the observation of the whole transit , only a small region of the ccd , including the target and some reference stars ,",

    "the instrument , now used exclusively for imaging , has a ccd with a fov @xmath33 and a resolution of 0.39 arcsec per pixel .",
    "the ccd was windowed and a bessell @xmath23 filter was used for all the transits .",
    "the 2.2 m mpg telescope holds in its coud - like focus the grond ( gamma ray optical near - infrared detector ) instrument ( @xcite ) .",
    "grond is a seven channel imager capable of performing simultaneous observations in four optical bands ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , similar to sloan filters ) and three near - infrared ( nir ) bands ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) .",

    "the primary goal of grond is the detection and follow - up of the optical / nir counterpart of gamma ray bursts , but it has already proven to be a great instrument to perform multicolour , simultaneous , photometric observations of planetary - transit events ( e.g.  @xcite ) . with this instrument",
    ", we observed one transit event of the planet wasp-45b and four of wasp-46b .",
    "the exposure time must be the same for each optical camera , and is also partially constrained by the nir exposure time chosen .",
    "we therefore decided to fix the exposure time to that optimising the @xmath25-band counts ( generally higher than in the other bands ) in order to avoid saturation .",
    "the 2.2 m mpg telescope also hosts feros ( fibre - fed extended range optical spectrograph ) .",
    "this chelle spectrograph covers a wide wavelength range of 370 nm to 860 nm and has an average resolution of @xmath43 .",
    "the precision of the radial velocity ( rv ) measurements obtained with feros is good enough ( @xmath44ms@xmath45 ) for detecting and confirming jupiter - size exoplanets ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "simultaneously to the science observations , we always obtained a spectrum of a thar lamp in order to have a proper wavelength calibration .",
    "five spectra of wasp-45 were obtained with feros .      for all photometric data , a suitable number of calibration frames , bias and ( sky ) flat - field images ,",
    "were taken on the same day as the observations .",
    "master bias and flat - field images were created by median - combining all the individual bias and flat - field images , and used to calibrate the scientific images .    with the exception of the eulercam data",
    ", we then extracted the photometry from the calibrated images using a version of the aperture - photometry algorithm daophot @xcite implemented in the defot pipeline @xcite .",
    "we measured the flux of the targets and of several reference stars in the fovs , selecting those of similar brightness to the target and not showing any significant brightness variation due to intrinsic variability or instrumental effects . for each dataset , we tried different aperture sizes for both the inner and outer rings , and the final ones that we selected ( see table[obslog ] ) were those that gave the lowest scatter in the out - of - transit ( oot ) region .",
    "light curves were then obtained by performing differential photometry using the reference stars in order to correct for non - intrinsic variations of the flux of the target , which are caused by atmospheric or air - mass changes .",
    "also in this case we tried different combinations of multiple comparison stars and chose those that gave the lowest scatter in the oot region .",
    "we noticed that the different options gave consistent transit shapes but had a small effect on the scatter of the points in the light curves .",
    "finally , each light curve was obtained by optimising the weights of the chosen comparison stars .",
    "the eulercam photomety was also extracted using relative aperture photometry with the extraction being performed for a number of target and sky apertures , of which the best was selected based on the final lightcurve rms .",
    "the selection of the reference stars was done iteratively , optimizing the scatter of the full transit lightcurves based on preliminary fits of transit shapes to the data at each optimization step . for further details ,",
    "please see @xcite .    to properly compare the different light curves and avoid underestimation of the uncertainties assigned to each photometric point , we inflated the errors by multiplying them by the @xmath46 ( defined as @xmath47/ dof , where dof is the number of degrees of freedom ) obtained from the first fit of each light curve .",
    "we then took into account the possible presence of correlated noise or systematic effects using the @xmath48 approach ( e.g.  @xcite ) , with which we further enlarged the uncertainties .",
    "the nir light curves observed with grond were reduced following @xcite , by carefully subtracting the dark from each image and flat - fielding them , and correcting for the read - out pattern .",
    "no sky subtraction was performed since no such calibration files were available .",
    "unfortunately , the quality of the data was not good enough to proceed with a detailed analysis of the transits .",
    "the spectra obtained with feros were extracted using a new pipeline written for chelle spectrographs , adapted for this instrument and optimised for the subsequent rv measurements ( @xcite ) . in brief , first a master - bias and a master - flat were constructed as the median of the frames obtained during the afternoon routine calibrations .",
    "the master - bias was subtracted from the science frames in order to account for the ccd intrinsic inhomogeneities , while the master - flat was used to find and trace all 39 chelle orders .",
    "the spectra of the target and the calibration thar lamp were extracted following @xcite .",
    "the science spectrum was then calibrated in wavelength using the thar spectrum , and a barycentric correction was applied . in order to measure the rv of the star , the spectrum was cross - correlated with a binary mask chosen according to the spectral class of the target . for each chelle order a cross correlation function ( ccf )",
    "was found and the rv measured by fitting a combined one , which is obtained as a weighted sum of all the ccf , with a gaussian .",
    "the uncertainties on the rvs were calculated using empirical scaling relations from the width of the ccf and the mean s / n measured around 570 nm .",
    "the rv measurements are reported in table[w45_rv ] ."
