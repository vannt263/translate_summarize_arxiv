    "the anomalous hall effect ( ahe)@xcite has been known and experimentally investigated for a long time , but until recently has eluded a rigorous quantum mechanical description .",
    "the revival of interest in the ahe during the last few years was mainly driven by the discovery of new applications in spintronics , by the new interpretation of electronic properties from the point of view of the berry phase theory,@xcite and also by the increasing computational resources which made possible the computationally very expensive _ ab initio _ assessment of the ahe in transition - metals.@xcite    the reason why the theoretical description of the ahe , and even more its calculation , is so challenging is that unlike the ordinary hall effect , which can be intuitively explained in terms of the lorentz force , the ahe originates from a variety of elaborated physical mechanisms . within the semi - classical theory , three different contributions to the ahe",
    "can be distinguished according to the underlying processes:@xcite the _ intrinsic _ contribution , which is the topological property of the band structure and exists even without disorder , and two disorder - driven _ extrinsic _ contributions .",
    "these are the _ skew scattering_,@xcite which arises from an asymmetric mott scattering of electrons off impurities in the presence of spin - orbit interaction , and the _ side jump_,@xcite which can be formally defined as the remaining part of extrinsic scattering and was historically interpreted as a sideways displacement of electrons scattering off impurities when spin - orbit interaction is present .    experimentally , distinguishing different contributions from their scaling behavior with the impurity concentration and temperature does not present a trivial task.@xcite in this context _ ab initio _ calculations of the ahe play an important role since in principle they allow us to access different contributions separately and explicitly investigate the effect of disorder , thus presenting an important tool for understanding and engineering the behavior of the ahe in real materials .",
    "ab initio _ calculations of the ahe have mainly focused on the ic , for which an explicit expression in terms of the berry curvature of the perfect crystal has been known for some time.@xcite calculations of the ahe including disorder due to alloying or an alloy - analogy model for a set of thermal lattice displacements have been performed using the korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) method in combination with the coherent potential approximation ( cpa).@xcite these methods rely on exact knowledge of the disorder potential , which has to be explicitly included in the _ ab initio _ calculation .",
    "this makes the calculation of the disorder driven contributions by far more complicated and expensive than the calculation of the intrinsic part .    with vanishing disorder ,",
    "a certain part of the ahe , which we call the _ scattering - independent _ ahe , acquires a constant value , which is believed to be disorder - independent.@xcite treating disorder within a short - ranged gaussian disorder model , this scattering - independent contribution to ahe can be identified in the clean limit.@xcite the scattering - independent ahe can be conveniently calculated from the electronic structure of the pure crystal even for multi - band metals@xcite and provides the dominant source of the ahe in transition - metal ferromagnets which are moderately disordered.@xcite in a sense , the clean limit scattering - independent ahe presents the ground level value , around which the disorder - sensitive contributions arise .",
    "the combination of the short - ranged gaussian disorder model with realistic electronic structure calculations is thus a very attractive alternative approach to treating the effect of disorder on the ahe and related phenomena on the _ ab initio _ level .    in the past ,",
    "based on the semiclassical boltzmann equation and kubo - streda formalism , it was argued by sinitsyn and co - workers@xcite that an additional to ic and sj scattering - independent contribution to the ahe is provided by the so - called _ intrinsic skew - scattering_. as the conventional skew - scattering , which is inversely proportional to the impurity concentration and thus arises due to incoherent superposition of scattering at each defect , isk also originates from asymmetric part of the collision kernel , but it reflects the interference between scattering at different impurities and it scales the same as sj and ic .",
    "diagrammatically speaking , while the conventional skew - scattering is due to the vertex corrections that involve correlators of more than two powers of the disorder potential , the isk is only due to gaussian disorder correlations.@xcite the importance of isk in terms of its relation to other contributions on a model level or in ferromagnetic materials was never investigated .    in this work , based on the formalism of kovalev and weischenberg,@xcite",
    "we derive analytical expressions for the ahe in the presence of finite gaussian disorder which can be evaluated solely from the electronic structure of the perfect crystal .",
    "this is done by constructing the unperturbed green functions based on a preceeding electronic structure calculation , and then applying the gaussian disorder model to obtain the self - energy , from which the full green function and the vertex corrections can be calculated . in the clean limit",
    "we thus obtain _ all _ scattering - independent contributions , which , in addition to ic and sj considered previously,@xcite also include the intrinsic skew - scattering .",
    "we implement derived expressions in the first - principles full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( flapw ) code fleur,@xcite and calculate the ahe in the clean limit and away from it in typical metallic ferromagnets studied theoretically and experimentally : bcc fe , fcc co , l1@xmath0-fepd , l1@xmath0-fept and thin films of bcc fe(001 ) .",
    "overall , we obtain a good agreement of our results with experimental data , indicating that the gaussian disorder model is well suited for modeling the effect of impurities and to some extent even effect of temperature . analyzing the individual contributions , unambiguously distinguishable within our approach",
    ", we find that in most materials neither intrinsic nor extrinsic ahc shows a trivial behavior as a function of resistivity or temperature .",
    "one of our key findings is that isk is just as important as the ic and sj , and including it into consideration systematically improves agreement with experiment .",
    "we can also conclude that the main contribution to the ahe , which completely drives its behavior with respect to disorder in the investigated materials , comes from the fermi surface , whereas the fermi sea provides a smaller contribution that is quite insensitive to disorder .",
    "we can use the kubo formalism to derive the expression for the anomalous hall conductivity ( ahc ) at zero temperature in terms of the retarded and advanced green functions @xmath1 of the perfectly periodic crystal and the velocity operator @xmath2 .",
    "this gives rise to a sum of two terms ( throughout this section we set @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 } \\end{aligned } \\label{eq : sigma_1}\\ ] ] and @xmath5 } \\right\\rbrace } } ~ , \\end{aligned } \\label{eq : sigma_2}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the cartesian indices and @xmath8 is the fermi level .",
    "@xmath9 we will refer to as the fermi - surface term since it has contributions coming only from the fermi surface .",
    "@xmath10 accumulates the contributions from all occupied states and it is therefore referred to as the fermi - sea term .",
    "together these two terms yield the anomalous hall conductivity of a disorder - free crystal .    in order to treat disordered systems instead of @xmath11 in eqs .",
    "and we have to consider the full green function @xmath12 which is obtained from @xmath11 and the self - energy @xmath13 , incorporating the effect of disorder .",
    "this is done using two different models . within the first model the self - energy is approximated by a constant imaginary part @xmath14 . whereas this model does not treat scattering explicitly and is thus not able to reproduce the disorder driven contributions to the ahe",
    ", it is well suited for studying the effect of finite temperatures on the intrinsic contribution . in order to cover",
    "also the disorder driven contributions , a short - range gaussian disorder model together with configurational averaging is used to account for impurity scattering explicitly .      setting @xmath15 to @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the identity matrix , results in a green function that is diagonal in the eigenspace of the hamiltonian : @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the single - electron eigen energies . inserting @xmath20 instead of @xmath11 into and respectively yields @xmath21 and @xmath22 where all matrices are given in the eigenbasis of @xmath23 . in the clean limit @xmath24",
    "the sum of both terms converges to the well - known berry curvature expression for the intrinsic ahe , @xmath25      in order to derive the scattering - originated contributions to the ahe we use the model potential @xmath26 which consists of a number @xmath27 of delta functions at positions @xmath28 .",
    "we calculate the averaged green function @xmath29 , which is obtained by taking the configurational average over all possible distributions of @xmath27 impurities . in the following",
    "we will refer to @xmath30 as @xmath20 and treat it as a regular green function which fulfills the dyson equation . in order to obtain an expression for the self - energy @xmath13 ,",

    "the first order term only gives a constant energy shift that can be hidden in the chemical potential and is thus irrelevant .",

    "this truncation is justified by the fact that the self - consistent evaluation of reproduces all higher order terms which are important at low impurity concentrations .    for a complete description of the ahe",
    "we also need to include the vertex corrections ,  i.e. , all the terms which are not obtained when the full green function is inserted into and . which terms these are can be made clear diagrammatically . in terms of feynman",

    "the side jump @xmath48 is defined by the disorder - driven terms which emerge when replacing @xmath11 by @xmath20 in the fermi surface term . in the clean limit it converges to the scattering - independent side - jump contribution.@xcite the remaining part , which corresponds to the vertex corrections ,",

    "the latter is divergent in the clean limit but it is negligible in the region of impurity concentrations which are usual for moderately disordered metals.@xcite in our work the conventional skew scattering is not considered since it does not arise from the gaussian disorder model that we use . speaking diagrammatically ,",

    "we construct a set of maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwf ) @xmath50 on a coarse @xmath45-point grid , where @xmath51 are the bloch states in the wannier gauge , obtained by a unitary mixing of the eigenstates @xmath52 .",

    "all film calculations were performed with @xmath74 @xmath45-points in the full brillouin zone and @xmath75 . for the 3-layer film we constructed @xmath64 mlwfs per layer using the same first - guess orbitals as in the bulk case . for the other films we constructed only @xmath76 mlwfs per layer , starting from @xmath77- and @xmath78-orbitals . in all cases",
    "an @xmath79 grid was used . in order to calculate the ahe in a film",
    "the expressions in the previous sections can be straightforwardly adapted to two dimensions , with the only difference that the conductance is calculated instead of the conductivity .",
    "the ahc is then obtained from dividing by the film thickness , which was approximated by @xmath80 .",
    "the method which we introduced above was used to calculate the ahe in disordered ferromagnets solely based on the _ ab initio _ electronic structure of the perfect crystal .",
    "this approach has already been successfully used by kovalev @xcite and weischenberg @xcite to calculate the sj in clean limit . in this work",
    "we extend the latter approach by introducing finite disorder in the form of a single disorder parameter into the calculation .",
    "this has the advantage that a systematic treatment and an easy tuning of disorder , which enables the straightforward application of the method to any new material , is possible .",
    "moreover , our approach allows us to unambiguously separate the ahe into different contributions according to",
    ". this could be particularly beneficial for comparison with the model studies@xcite and for establishing the ahe scaling laws relevant experimentally.@xcite in particular , this allows us to investigate the importance of the intrinsic skew scattering contribution in ferromagnets both at finite disorder and in the clean limit , which has not been considered so far .    for the calculation of the ic the effect of disorder",
    "was simulated by broadening of the bands , as described in section [ sec : method ] .",
    "whereas the isk is calcualted directly , the sj results from the difference between the total ahc without vertex corrections and the ic . in order to be able to compare our results at finite disorder to experimental values it is necessary to relate the abstract disorder parameter to an experimentally accessible quantity .",
    "this was done by additionally calculating the diagonal conductivity , which allows to plot @xmath81 as a function of the longitudinal resistivity @xmath82 .",
    "it is clear that in reality the ahc as well as the resistivity depend on a variety of factors such as the impurity concentration , the type of disorder and its microscopic details .",
    "thus , the description in terms of a single parameter describing disorder can be only a rough approximation . in this respect , when the objective is to simulate the effect of a particular source of disorder , our approach is inferior to methods where disorder is explicitly considered in the _ ab initio _ calculation , such as kkr plus cpa approach.@xcite however it seems more general in the sense that it takes into account all kinds of disorder sources and bundles them in an average disorder potential . in how far this is a reasonable description of the experimental situation , where one usually also deals with a variety of ( often unknown ) sorts of disorder acting together , and in how far our method is able to simulate the effect of particular sources of disorder , can be found out only via comparison to experimental data .",
    "one of the objectives of this work is tackling the question of how well the gaussian disorder model is capable of modeling the effect of temperature on the ahe . for this purpose",
    "we use the values of experimental resistivity as a function of temperature to derive the temperature dependence of the ahc from its resistivity dependence .",
    "the results are then compared to experiments .",
    "one has to note that although the temperature dependence of the ahc can come from various sources , probably the most important source of scattering which our approach is meant to reproduce is the scattering at phonons , since we compare our calculations to experiments performed quite far from the curie temperature for considered materials .",
    "the temperature as well as the resistivity dependence of the ahc and its individual contributions will now be discussed separately for each investigated material .",
    "the results of our calculations of the ahe in bcc fe are presented in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . as we can see , the ahe in fe is largely driven by the intrinsic contribution @xmath47 over a wide range of diagonal resistivity @xmath83 .",
    "the dependence of the ahc on @xmath83 is quite pronounced , with an overall reduction by a factor of 3 as @xmath83 reaches 80@xmath84 cm .",
    "the sj part @xmath48 is much smaller when compared to the intrinsic conductivity values , which is in accordance with weischenberg s clean limit calculation for fe.@xcite the isk contribution to the ahc , @xmath49 , is also small , although is becomes dominant over side jump in the vicinity of the @xmath83 where side jump changes sign .",
    "both extrinsic contributions do not exceed 150 s / cm in absolute value for the whole considered resistivity range . in the clean limit , adding all contributions to the ahc results in the value of about 950  s / cm , which is very close to the value of about 1000@xmath851100  s / cm for the  intrinsic \" , or , as it should be properly addressed , scattering - independent ahc in bcc fe , obtained from carefully crafted recent measurements by tian _ et al._@xcite in this respect , the inclusion of the intrinsic skew - scattering improves the agreement between theory and experiment.@xcite    converting the @xmath83 dependence into a temperature ( @xmath86 ) dependence using experimental resistivity data from ref .",
    "[ ] , we obtain a relatively small decrease of the ahc over temperature leading to a room temperature value of 800  s / cm .",
    "the decrease of the ahc by about 20% as compared to zero @xmath86 can be solely attributed to a decrease in @xmath48 , whereas the ic and isk contributions remain basically constant over @xmath86 below 300  k. noticably , at 300  k the scattering is dominated by intrinsic skew scattering .    since experimental values for the ahc as a function of temperature are not available for iron , we instead plot @xmath87 versus @xmath83 , where @xmath88 is the transverse resistivity . in this representation",
    "we can compare our results to experimental data by tian _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "[ ] , who measured @xmath89 and @xmath83 at varying temperatures , see right panel of fig .  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "qualitatively , the calculated values of @xmath87 show an almost linear behavior that is experimentally also observed in iron at higher temperatures , and while theory and experiment agree very well for lower values of @xmath83 , at higher @xmath86 the experimental line has a higher slope than the calculated one .",
    "one of the conclusions we can make from this plot is that the perfomance of the fits and indentification of extracted parameters with different sources of the ahe has to be done with care , especially when the @xmath83 is tuned by varying @xmath86 .",
    "e.g.  in bcc fe the slope of the linear fit of the theoretical data in the above plot gives the value of 730  s / cm , which is even lower than the room temperature value of the calculated ahc .",
    "the corresponding fit of the experimental data yields the value of 1280  s / cm , also obviously off the experimental value for the scattering - independent ahc in fe .",
    "in section [ sec : method ] we have decomposed the ahc into fermi sea and fermi surface terms which can be calculated separately .",
    "the calculation of these two terms in bcc fe yields that the behavior of the ahc as a function of resistivity is purely driven by the fermi surface term .",
    "this is in accordance to the observation that the main origin of the variation of the ahc with @xmath83 is the side jump .",
    "the fermi sea contribution on the other hand varies very slowly as a function of @xmath83 , but , unlike in other materials considered in the following , is not negligible in fe , where it contributes approximately @xmath90 to the total ahc .",
    "the ahc in fcc co shows a behavior close to that in bcc fe , see lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , in that it exhibits similar decay rate with @xmath83 .",
    "also the clean limit values of total ahc are very close in both materials . however , unlike in iron , all three contributions to the ahc are of the same order of magnitude and it is mostly the sj and the isk which are responsible for the @xmath83 dependence , whereas the ic does not vary with @xmath83 significantly . the fermi sea contribution to",
    "the ahc in fcc co lies well below @xmath91 of the total value and hardly changes with temperature .    in order to compare our calculations to experiment",
    ", we use the experimental data for fcc co by hou _",

    "we construct the temperature dependence of the ahc using the experimental @xmath83 resistivity data taking into account the residual resistivity of @xmath92 . at low temperatures",
    "the agreement of our results with experiment is excellent , with the ahc value of about 750  s / cm , which is smaller than the zero - disorder limit value due to the offset in @xmath83 by @xmath93 in resistivity - dependence of the ahc in fig .",

    "however , here one has to take into account that in these particular samples of fept the skew scattering angle of about 1% is extremely large , as can be also seen from @xmath87 plot , in which extrinsic skew - scattering corresponds to a shift of the whole curve along the @xmath97-axis .",
    "this leads to a conventional skew scattering @xmath98 of about 800  s / cm at 4k , decreasing towards higher temperatures .",
    "since the conventional skew scattering is not taken into account within our model , it makes sense to compare theoretical values to @xmath99 , finding that our calculations actually overestimate seemann s values by 10@xmath8515% at lower @xmath86 , thus providing overall a rather good agreement .",
    "noticably , the slopes of the @xmath87 curves are almost identical between theory and experiment , and the corresponding curves lie very close to each other .    the agreement with the experimental data of he _",
    "_ is worse , on the other hand , which we can attribute to the smaller thickness of the samples and their smaller ordering parameter , the effect of which could result in a systematic shift to lower values by about 30% as compared to our theoretical results , also visible in @xmath87 dependence . as apparent from comparison of correspoding xrd spectra,@xcite another reason for discrepancy here could be the difference in the structure which goes beyond the degree of ordering of the samples used by seemann _",
    "et al._@xcite and he _ et al._@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one has to note that the overall trend of the ahc with temperature is the same from theory as it is in experiments .",
    "moreover , from careful inspection of the curves for the total ahc in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] for both alloys we can state that even fine features of the @xmath86-dependence in experiments of he _",
    "are well - reproduced with our calculations @xmath85",
    "e.g.  the rise of the ahc up to 150  k for fepd , or the slight decay of the ahc at around 200  k for fept are clearly noticable in both alloys .",
    "this suggests that the gaussian disorder model can reproduce the effect of temperature on the ahe in these alloys rather well .",
    "finally , in addition to bulk fe we also investigate the ahe in thin bcc fe(001 ) films of 3- , 5- , 7- and 11-layer thickness .",
    "this approximately corresponds to the thickness of @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and 2  nm , respectively . to our knowledge , no experimental data exists for such ultra - thin fe films . as can be seen from our calculations , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : film ] , the behavior of the ahe for bcc fe in the limit of ultra - thin films is very different from that in bulk , given in fig .  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the side - jump contribution in 3-layer film is very small , but it rises in magnitude significantly as the film thickness is increased , reaching as much as @xmath85700  s / cm for 11 layers , and exhibiting a change of sign at small values of @xmath83 . increasing thickness further towards the bulk limit will bring the magnitude of @xmath48 down , and the change - of - sign point to higher values of @xmath83 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the intrinsic skew - scattering contributes mostly in 3- and 5-layer films , while its magnitude gets significantly smaller as the thickness is increased , see also fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . remarkably , for 3- and 5-layer films @xmath49 hits as much as 1000",
    "s / cm in magnitude , and its dependence on @xmath83 determines the behavior of overall ahc , which even exhibits a change of sign for 3 layers . on the other hand the intrinsic part of the ahc determines the total ahe with increasing thickness , both in magnitude and behavior , in consistency with the calculations for bulk fe . and",
    "while the 3-layer @xmath47 does not depend on @xmath83 , this dependence is quantitatively consistent with that in bulk fe for larger thickness , although it is much more pronounced .",
    "overall , one has to point out that the intrinsic values in clean limit are rather far off the bulk value , except for the 5-layer film .",
    "the insets in fig .",
    "[ fig : film ] show that unlike in most of the bulk ferromagnets considered previously the behavior of @xmath87 is strongly non - linear , which indicates that the common scaling laws which predict linearity do not hold in ultra - thin films .    to conclude , in the limit of ultra - thin films one can expect large changes in the total value of the ahe , its sign , and the magnitude of the contributions of different origin .",
    "this marks the few - layer thin nanostructures of ferromagnets as an exciting type of systems to study in the future , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "in summary , we have implemented a method for calculating the ahc in disordered ferromagnets solely from the electronic structure of the perfect crystal .",
    "we used gaussian model for disorder potential that allows us to tune disorder via a single parameter , presenting thus a significant simplification as compared to more elaborated schemes . in the clean limit , within our approach",
    "we arrive at all scattering - independent contributions to the ahe : intrinsic , side jump and intrinsic skew - scattering contributions .",
    "in particular the latter has been never evaluated in real materials .",
    "we implemented our method within the flapw code fleur and applied it to a number of bulk ferromagnets and thin films .",
    "we found that in most materials our model is able to reproduce the correct qualitative behavior of @xmath87 as a function of the longitudinal resistivity , generally providing also rather good quantitative agreement with experiments .",
    "in particular , we were able to describe the temperature dependence of the ahe from the knowledge of the experimental @xmath83 . within our approach",
    "we transparently separated the intrinsic , side jump , and intrinsic skew scattering contributions to the ahe and studied their respective resistivity / temperature dependences , finding that in most cases they all exhibit a non - trivial behavior .",
    "in particular we demonstrated that in most ferromagnets the intrinsic skew scattering improves agreement with experiments in that it provides a significant contribution that can even exceed the intrinsic and the side jump contributions at low resistivities .",
