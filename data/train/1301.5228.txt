    "most of the methods used in the previous section in order to prove these theorems can be successfully generalized and used in other situations .",
    "in particular , one should be able to obtain an analog of theorem iii , which is one of the key steps in the analytic classification .",
    "when dealing with a case of a single singularity of a ( non - parametric ) system , the standard procedure is to pass first through the formal classification ( formal power series equivalence ) and then , using ( multi-)summability , to obtain a chain of sectorial normalizations asymptotic to the formal transformation , hence a stronger variant of theorem iii .",
    "however , we suggest that in problems involving parameters and/or multiple singular points , one should relax the asymptoticity of the normalizing transformations by demanding instead that the transformations are just bounded near each singularity , while at the same time allowing coverings by more general kind of domains ( sector - like or spiraling sector - like near each singularity ) , as in theorem iii here , or as previously in @xcite ( theorem 4.21 ) in the case of unfolding of non - resonant singularity of poincar rank 1 . this would define a new kind of equivalence , more general then the standard formal equivalence . in this approach , each such chain of normalizing transformations",
    "then determines a `` cocycle '' of bounded sectorial automorphisms of some chosen model system on the intersections of the domains of the covering .",
    "this should be seen as an element of a certain `` cohomology '' space ( generalizing the stokes cohomology ) whose elements would be identified with analytic equivalence classes of systems .",
    "a suitable cohomology theory that would allow to deal with such cocycles needs yet to be formulated .",
    "another interesting question that comes to one s mind is that of whether corollary [ cor:1 ] stays valid also in more general situations : considering two families of systems depending on the same parameter , if the systems restricted to each parameter value are analytically equivalent on some open set independent of the parameter , does that imply that they are also equivalent as parametric families on that set ?",
