    "double auction markets ( aka exchanges ) allow multiple sellers and multiple buyers to trade a commodity simultaneously , e.g. the new york stock exchange .",
    "each trader ( seller or buyer ) has a private valuation of the commodity . in a double auction market , sellers submit asks ( sell orders ) to sell a commodity and buyers submit bids ( buy orders ) to buy the commodity .",
    "we assume that each trader supplies / demands one unit of the commodity .",
    "given asks and bids submitted by traders , the market owner ( aka auctioneer ) matches them using certain market clearing polices in order to make transactions .",
    "traditionally , double auctions have been well studied in static settings , where all traders are known before the auctioneer makes any decision  @xcite . however , in most modern double auction markets , traders arrive and depart at different times .",
    "we call these markets _ online double auctions_. the main challenge for the auctioneer in an online double auction is to make decisions without knowing the traders / orders not yet arrived .",
    "the decisions involve an online bipartite matching ( i.e. allocation ) between sellers and buyers and a payment calculation .",
    "following the previous work in online auction design  @xcite , this article makes an incremental step in this field .",
    "we focus on two important criteria , _ truthfulness _ and _ efficiency _ , for online double auction design .",
    "we say a mechanism is truthful if for each trader , reporting his truthful type , including valuation , arrival and departure time , is his dominant strategy , and it is efficient if the social welfare of its allocation is maximised among all feasible allocations .",
    "we show that there is no deterministic and truthful online double auction that is also competitive for efficiency in an adversarial model .",
    "then we further study the environment where sellers are relatively static compared with buyers . within this environment , two situations are examined : 1 ) the demand ( the number of buyers ) is not more than the supply ( the number of sellers ) , but not known exactly , 2 ) the demand is predictable but not necessarily not more than the supply . we show that , in the first situation , a deterministic and truthful greedy - mechanism is actually @xmath0-competitive . in the second situation",
    ", we propose a framework to reduce a truthful online double auction to a truthful online one - sided auction , and demonstrate that the competitiveness of the reduced online double auction follows that of the online one - sided auction .",
    "especially , by using the reduction , we achieve a truthful auction that is almost @xmath1-competitive , i.e. the social welfare of the auction s allocation is nearly optimised , when buyers arrive randomly .",
    "finally , we show that the assumption made on sellers arrival and departure can be relaxed by , for example , decomposing a market into multiple disjoint sub - markets and applying the proposed mechanisms in each sub - market .      during last decade ,",
    "there have been substantial researches on mechanism design in different dynamic environments , termed _ online mechanism design _",
    "( see @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "most of the previous work has focused on one - sided dynamic markets where either the supply or the demand is dynamic , e.g. ad auctions  @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the auctioneer ( in most cases , the seller ) in one - sided dynamic markets does not provide valuations ( or reserve prices ) to the commodities exchanged and is not considered to strategically manipulate the auction .",
    "however , in online double auction markets , both the supply and the demand are dynamic and playing strategically , and the auctioneer has no control of any of them .    to tackle the complexity of online double auction design , existing research has utilised certain accessible prior knowledge of the dynamics to design desirable online auctions  @xcite .",
    "for instance , given the assumption that the valuations of traders are in a range @xmath2 $ ] , blum _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a @xmath3-competitive truthful online double auction in an adversarial setting for maximising social welfare , where @xmath3 is the fixed point of @xmath4 .",
    "besides that , they also considered many other criteria .",
    "moreover , assumed that traders available / active time period in the auction is no more than some constant @xmath5 , bredin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite designed a framework to construct truthful online double auctions from truthful static double auctions , and demonstrated the performance ( for maximising social welfare ) of the auctions given by the framework in probabilistic settings through experiments .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sect_pre ] , we briefly introduce our market model and related concepts . in section [ sect_neg ] ,",
    "we show the impossibility result .",
    "then we propose a deterministic and truthful mechanism that is @xmath0-competitive in section [ sect_case1 ] and a framework to reduce a truthful online double auction to a truthful online one - sided auction in section [ sect_case2 ] for two restricted environments respectively .",
    "we conclude in section [ sect_con ] with some discussions .",
    "we consider an online / dynamic double auction market , in which a set @xmath6 of * buyers * and a set @xmath7 of * sellers * trade one commodity . buyers and sellers are * traders*. we will refer to a seller as she and a buyer or trader as he .",
    "let @xmath8 and assume that traders are independent and no trader can be both buyer and seller at the same time , i.e. @xmath9 . each trader supplies or demands a single unit of the commodity during a specific time period called the active time of the trader . since each trader might have different active times , they might come and leave the market at different times , which causes the dynamics of the market . given the dynamics of the market , the * auctioneer * ( market owner )",
    "is challenged by making decisions without knowing those traders not yet arrived .",
    "each trader @xmath10 has a privately observed * type * @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is @xmath14 s valuation of a single unit of the commodity , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the starting point and the ending point of @xmath14 s * active time * , i.e. the arrival and departure time of @xmath14 . due to the revelation principle",
    "@xcite , we focus on mechanisms that require traders to directly report their types . however , traders do not necessarily report their true types but no early - arrival and no late - departure misreports are permitted , i.e. given trader @xmath14 s type @xmath11 , his report @xmath17 satisfies @xmath18 and @xmath19 \\subseteq [ a_i , d_i]$ ] .",
    "the intuition behind this constraint is that traders do not recognise the market before their arrival and they do not get utility for any trade happened after their true departure .",
    "we say a seller s report ( called * ask * ) @xmath20 and a buyer s report ( called * bid * ) @xmath21 are * matchable * if and only if @xmath22 and @xmath23\\cap [ a_j , d_j]\\not=\\emptyset$ ] .",
    "that is , a match / transaction should not decrease social welfare .",
    "let @xmath24 denote a complete type profile , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 be the complete ask and bid profile respectively .",
    "let @xmath27 be the type profile of all traders except for @xmath14 .",
    "an * online double auction ( oda ) * @xmath28 consists of an * allocation policy * @xmath29 and a * payment policy * @xmath30 , where @xmath31 indicates whether or not trader @xmath14 trades successfully during his reported active time ( @xmath1 means success ) , and @xmath32 determines the payment paid ( received ) by buyer ( seller ) @xmath14 during his ( her ) reported active time .",
    "an allocation @xmath33 is * feasible * if @xmath34 for all @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath35 .",
    "an oda @xmath28 is feasible if @xmath33 is feasible .",
    "feasibility guarantees that the auctioneer never takes short or long position in the commodity exchanged in the market .",
    "only feasible odas will be discussed in this article .",
    "given trader @xmath14 of type @xmath36 , report profile @xmath37 and oda @xmath28 , let @xmath38 , and the * utility * of @xmath14 is defined as @xmath39    an oda @xmath28 is * truthful * ( aka * incentive - compatible * ) if @xmath40 for all @xmath14 , all permitted misreports @xmath37 of @xmath35 , all type profile @xmath35 .",
    "an oda @xmath28 is * efficient * if @xmath41 maximises the * social welfare * @xmath42 for all type profile @xmath35 .    in other words ,",
    "an oda is efficient if it always allocates items to those traders who value them most highly . in a market with dynamic participants , it is often not possible for an online mechanism to guarantee efficient allocations without the knowledge of the dynamics , because the mechanism s decision - making is challenged by the uncertainty of future participants .",
    "therefore , we measure an online mechanism s efficiency by competitive analysis , namely , we compare the social welfare obtained by an online mechanism with the maximal social welfare one can achieve offline , i.e. when the mechanism knows all future coming reports . given type profile @xmath35 , let @xmath43 be the * optimal allocation * giving the optimal / maximal social welfare .",
    "note that @xmath43 is also constrained by feasibility .",
    "the following notion of competitiveness will be used to measure the efficiency of odas .",
    "[ def_competitive ] an oda @xmath44 is * @xmath45-competitive * if for any type profile @xmath35 , the social welfare of @xmath46 @xmath47 .",
    "we refer to @xmath45 as the * competitive ratio * of @xmath41 for efficiency .",
    "we say that @xmath41 is * competitive * if @xmath41 is @xmath45-competitive for some constant @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , we say a mechanism is * individually rational * if it gives its participants non - negative utility , i.e. they are not forced to participate , and a mechanism is * budget balanced * if the mechanism receives zero profit or _",
    "weakly budget balanced _ if its profit is non - negative .",
    "all the mechanisms discussed in the rest are individually rational without further mention .",
    "note that the mechanism we defined in the above are _",
    "deterministic_. non - deterministic mechanisms are also proposed / discussed in the rest , and they can be represented as a probabilistic combination of deterministic ones .",
    "in this section , we will demonstrate that no deterministic and truthful oda is competitive in an adversarial model .",
    "that is , for any deterministic and truthful oda @xmath28 , there exists a type profile @xmath35 such that the social welfare @xmath49 is infinitely far from the optimal one @xmath50 .",
    "[ the_nag ] for any deterministic and truthful oda @xmath28 and any @xmath48 , there exists a type profile @xmath35 such that @xmath51 .",
    "a deterministic oda makes decisions at a bids / ask s arrival time , departure time and/or predefined time points .",
    "if decisions are not only made at asks departure time , then we can always find a type profile @xmath37 such that the last arrived ask @xmath52 of @xmath37 is matched by @xmath41 before @xmath52 departs .",
    "let @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a bid and it arrives after @xmath52 is matched and before @xmath52 departs . since @xmath41 s decision does not depend on traders not yet arrived , @xmath55 will not be matched by @xmath46 because there is no unmatched ask available .",
    "there exists a @xmath55 such that @xmath55 is matched by @xmath43 ( if @xmath56 is sufficiently large ) and @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath56 approaches to @xmath58 , @xmath45 will also approach to @xmath58 .",
    "otherwise , i.e. decisions are only made at asks departure time , there exists a type profile @xmath35 where the last arrived bid @xmath54 arrives after the second last ask s departure , and departs after the last ask s arrival but before the last ask s departure , where we also get @xmath57 if @xmath56 is sufficiently large .",
    "note that truthfulness is necessary to guarantee that all types are truthfully reported so that social welfare is correctly measured .",
    "given the above impossibility , we can still search for non - deterministic and competitive mechanisms or examine cases where the dynamics is limited by , say , certain prior knowledge of the future participants .",
    "for instance , we may know the total number of traders arriving in the future , or traders valuation satisfying some known distributions . with certain prior knowledge of the traders , odas with desirable properties",
    "are achievable , e.g.  @xcite . in the rest of this paper , we further study two environments with prior information . in both cases ,",
    "we assume that sellers are * patient * , i.e. they are active before the first buyer s arrival until the arrival of the last buyer . in the first case , we further assume that the demand is no more than the supply , while in the other case we assume that we know how many buyers will arrive . although sellers are relatively static in these online double auctions , they are not as same as online one - sided auctions , even those considering reserve prices , because not only buyers but also sellers are playing strategically in double auctions .",
    "moreover , we will show in the conclusion how this assumption can be relaxed .",
    "although we just showed that in general deterministic mechanism is not competitive , in this section we demonstrate that a simple deterministic mechanism , called @xmath59 , is actually @xmath0-competitive , given that the demand ( i.e. the number of buyers ) is not more than the supply ( i.e. the number of sellers ) .      the allocation policy , called _ best - first ( bf ) allocation _ , of the deterministic oda @xmath59 greedily matches a newly arrived bid to the best unmatched ask , if they are matchable , until there is no unmatched ask left or all bids have arrived .",

    "figure  [ fig : bf1 ] shows an example of the greedy allocation , where dots indicate asks and bids , the value beside each dot represents the valuation of the ask / bid , and the order of the bids is their arrival order ( from top to bottom ) .",
    "there is a line between an ask and a bid if they are matched by the allocation .",
    "before we describe the payment policy of @xmath59 , let us first introduce a notion of reachability used in the payment policy .",
    "let @xmath63 be the sequence of ask - bid pairs that are matched by the greedy allocation in bid s arrival order , e.g. @xmath64 in the example shown in figure  [ fig : best - first ] , we say that two matched pairs @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 , are * reachable * from each other , if for all @xmath68 , bid @xmath69 and ask @xmath70 are matchable . for the example shown in figure  [ fig :",

    "each matched buyer pays the amount equal to the valuation of the seller to whom he is matched , which is the infimum of all possible reported valuations for him to be matched in the auction , while each matched seller receives the supremum of all payments she can ask to get matched . there is no payment for unmatched traders , i.e. the mechanism is individually rational .    *",

    "these two online one - sided auctions are based on secretary problems , i.e. traders arrive randomly and therefore @xmath127 of @xmath125 is an uniform random distribution function in these instances .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the reduction approach is also applicable if we do not know how many buyers will arrive but that their arrival time satisfies some distribution . in that case",
    ", we will assign an arrival time for each seller in the reduction following that distribution .",
    "we have studied the mechanism design problem of online double auction markets where traders are dynamically arriving and departing the markets . due to the complexity of the dynamics brought by traders",
    ", we showed that there is no deterministic and truthful online double auction that is competitive for maximising social welfare in an adversarial model .",
    "however , this impossibility does not apply to the situations where we can access certain prior information of the participants . in this paper , we studied two environments where sellers are relatively static and certain prior information of buyers is accessible . in the first environment , we assumed that the demand ( i.e. the number of buyers ) is not more than the supply ( i.e. the number of sellers ) . under this assumption",
    ", we proposed a deterministic yet @xmath0-competitive and truthful online mechanism in section  [ sect_case1 ] . in the second environment ,",
    "given the prior information that the number of incoming buyers is predictable , we demonstrated in section  [ sect_case2 ] how to reduce a truthful online double auction to a truthful online one - sided auction , and showed that the competitiveness of the reduced online double auction follows that of the online one - sided auction .",
    "especially , by using the reduction framework , we found an online double auction that is almost @xmath1-competitive .",
    "the mechanisms proposed in this paper are not ( weakly ) budget balanced , which is also an important factor besides truthfulness and efficiency and worth further investigation , though it is often very hard to achieve all three criteria together even in static cases  @xcite . in addition",
    ", there are many other online exchanges are worth further investigation , e.g. electric vehicle charging @xcite and kidney exchange  @xcite .",
    "one might suspect that the  static \" assumption made on sellers will limit the applicability of these mechanisms .",
    "we argue that they can be applied in more general settings where sellers can also arrive and depart at anytime .",
    "one way to apply these mechanisms is running multiple instances of them in sequence .",
    "in other words , we decompose an online market into multiple disjoint sub - markets where the conditions fit the assumptions made here . for example , in some exchange markets , both sellers and buyers come and leave randomly , but one side , e.g. sellers , stay longer than the other side . in that case , we can decompose the market into many sub - markets running for a period of , say , one - month , i.e. there will be 12 disjoint sub - markets for a one - year market .",
    "each trader is allocated to one / many sub - markets on his / her arrival , and the decomposition should guarantee that each seller is able to fully participate in at least one sub - market . under this decomposition ,",
    "if the market is in a rising situation , then applying the proposed auctions in each sub - market will achieve the same truthfulness and competitiveness for the whole market ( see the appendix for more details ) .",
    "we have seen that different prior knowledge gives us different advantages for designing online mechanisms , as it reduces the dynamics in some extent .",
    "especially , in very complex dynamic environments , without certain prior knowledge , in general it is impossible to get ideal mechanisms .",
    "therefore , one objective of mechanism design in such complex environments is searching for desirable mechanisms by utilising as less prior knowledge as possible . besides prior knowledge",
