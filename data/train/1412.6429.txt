    "resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) has emerged as a powerful technique to study momentum dependent magnetic- and charge - excitations in correlated materials.@xcite in particular a significant insight into the dynamics of high - temperature superconducting cuprates has been gained ( for a recent review see ref .  ) . while cu @xmath11-edge rixs ( soft rixs ) is well suited for studying magnetic excitations in cuprates,@xcite cu @xmath0-edge rixs ( hard rixs ) is useful for understanding their charge dynamics.@xcite however in the case of iron based superconductors , experiments have been limited in both regimes .    unlike cuprates ,",
    "fe in pnictides / chalcogenides is in a tetrahedral environment , where on - site mixing between fe @xmath12 and @xmath13 orbitals is allowed .",
    "this mixing allows strong @xmath14 type fluorescence emission that dominates most rixs spectra,@xcite which is not the case in cuprates where cu is in octahedral environments .",
    "observation of charge or spin excitations in these fe compounds with rixs is thus very challenging , as the rixs features are usually much weaker than the fluorescence line . in their fe @xmath0-edge",
    "rixs experiment , jarrige and coworkers circumvented this problem by utilizing resonance at a much higher incident energy ; here the contribution from the fluorescence line was much smaller .",

    "moreover they demonstrate that both fe @xmath0- and @xmath11-edge rixs can provide us with new insight into the physics of the iron based superconductors , just like for cuprates .    among iron based superconductors , alkali metal iron selenides present an interesting case for rixs studies . these compounds , with a generic chemical composition a@xmath18fe@xmath19se@xmath3 ( a = k , cs and rb),@xcite are in many ways unique among isostructural iron pnictides.@xcite for instance , measurements of the fermi surfaces , by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes),@xcite",
    "show that these systems exhibit no nesting properties of electron- and hole - like fermi surfaces , which is incompatible with the fermi surface driven spin - fluctuation mediated superconductivity.@xcite however , one of the unresolved issues in these materials is the intrinsic phase separation . there is not a consensus on whether the parent compound is insulating,@xcite semiconducting,@xcite or even metallic.@xcite a phase separation @xcite has been suggested to explain these observations .",
    "interestingly , the problem of phase separation , which exists in the superconducting materials ( insulating / magnetic and metallic domains),@xcite seems to disappear in the insulating samples which can be obtained for a particular value of @xmath20 ( e.g. k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 ) .",

    "such a transition is possible since the absence of a center of symmetry at the tetrahedral fe site allows a significant on - site mixing between fe @xmath13 and @xmath12 orbitals to occur , pushing some of the fe @xmath12 states below the fermi level .",

    "as you move away from @xmath49 , the center of mass of the feature shifts to lower energy and the peak seems to become sharper with maximum intensity near 0.9  ev .",

    "short description on the calculation method is found in appendix [ app : rixstheory ] , for detailed description see refs .  .",
    "we used two different tight - binding models .",
    "the first is a 102-orbital model , which includes fe @xmath13 , fe @xmath58 , fe @xmath12 , and se @xmath12 orbitals in order to reproduce the density of states ( dos ) near the fermi level ( @xmath59 ) as precisely as possible .",
    "the second , a 70-orbital model , inluding only fe @xmath13 and se @xmath12 orbitals , is used to calculate the low - energy rixs spectral weight , which has a strong contribution from the correlated fe @xmath13 electrons . we note that since the band structure calculations overestimate the bandwidth of the states in the energy range -2  ev  @xmath60  1  ev , a renormalization factor of @xmath61 was needed .",

    "[ fig03 ] ( a ) the fe 3@xmath7/4@xmath62 and se 4@xmath62 dos from the 102-orbital model is plotted . since the fe @xmath12 partial dos extends across @xmath59 , the fe @xmath12 states below @xmath59 should contribute significantly to the rixs spectra .",
    "the following excitation process is considered : a @xmath38 core - electron is promoted , through the absorption of a photon ( black arrow ) , into the empty fe @xmath12 states and subsequently an fe @xmath13 or @xmath12 electron below @xmath59 fills the @xmath38 core - hole ( blue arrows ) , leaving behind an excited state . in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ( b ) we plot this calculated rixs spectrum as obtained from the 102-orbital model at the @xmath49- and @xmath51-point . to account for the observed optical gap we have shifted the calculated spectrum by 350 mev towards higher energy loss .",
    "the overall agreement between the experimental results and our calculated rixs spectrum is very good .",
    "we can see that the two separate excitations at 1 ev and 3 - 7 ev are largely accounted for by the occupied density of states .",
    "we note that , since the fe 4@xmath62 states ( intermediate state ) have stronger hybridization with neighboring se or fe 4@xmath62 states than adjacent fe 3@xmath7 states , the 3 - 7 ev excitation becomes more pronounced than the 1 ev excitation . however , despite the good overall agreement , the observed momentum dependence of the 1 ev excitation can not be accounted for by the current 102-orbital model , which ignores electron correlation effect .",
    "since the low - energy rixs spectral features are expected to originate from fe @xmath13 and se @xmath12 , we carried out a separate calculation using the 70-orbital model which only focuses on these orbitals .",
    "this reduction in number of orbitals allows us to include the electron correlation , which is too computationally taxing for the 102-orbital model . in the 70-orbital calculation , processes to screen the @xmath38 core - hole are included and the random - phase approximation is used to account for fe",

    "@xcite in order to keep the physically meaningful ratio @xmath68 unchanged , the experimentally relevant energy scale is @xmath69 .",

    "overall rixs spectrum changes significantly as @xmath10 is varied .",
    "as @xmath10 increases from 1 ev to 2.5 ev we notice that the spectrum above 1  ev , which arises from fe - se @xmath71 charge - transfer ( ct ) , is suppressed .",
    "in particular , the large difference between the @xmath49- and m - point spectra present for @xmath72 ev more or less disappears for @xmath73 ev . by increasing @xmath10 above 2.5 ev ,",
    "the momentum dependence of the spectrum below 1  ev is also greatly suppressed , resulting in almost quenched momentum dependence in the entire energy range .",
    "based on these calculations and our results in fig .",
    "[ fig02](a ) , where variations with momentum were limited to the spectrum below 1 ev , we find that @xmath74 ev gives satisfying agreement with our results .",
    "we would like to point out that this @xmath10 value is in line with values obtained for a realistic blocked afm state in a five orbital hubbard model.@xcite this suggests that even in this insulating compound , a moderate coulomb repulsion similar to the iron pnictides is sufficient.@xcite    in order to examine the momentum dependence in detail , the low - energy region of the calculated rixs spectra from the 70-orbital model with @xmath73 ev are plotted in fig .",

    "[ fig06 ] ( b ) we notice that the 1 ev feature originates mostly from the fe @xmath13 states ( lighter - shaded area ) , with the largest contribution from a transition involving the @xmath8 and @xmath9 orbitals ( darker - shaded area ) : @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",

    "the calculation shows the spectral weight around 1  ev ( gray vertical bar ) increases significantly as we move away from @xmath49-point .",
    "similar momentum dependence , although weaker , is observed in the experimental data .",
    "therefore , we conclude that including moderate correlation energy @xmath10=2.5  ev in the 70-orbital calculation allows us to describe the observed momentum dependence of the 1  ev feature in our rixs data .",
    "to summarize our results , we find two spectral features , a sharp 1  ev peak and a broad feature around 3 - 7 ev , in our fe @xmath0-edge rixs investigation of k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 , an insulating iron chalcogenide .",
    "the observed low - energy feature exhibits a weak * q*-dependence , while the broad high energy peak is * q*-independent .",
    "overall energy positions and intensities of these two excitations can be captured using the 102-orbital model , which include fe @xmath13 , @xmath58 , and @xmath12 , and se @xmath12 states .",
    "however , the 102-orbital model , which does not take into account electron correlation , can not describe the * q*-dependence of the 1  ev feature . by using instead the 70-orbital model , which focuses on the fe @xmath13 and se @xmath12 states and takes into account electron correlation , a satisfactory description of the 1  ev feature is achieved using @xmath73 ev .",
    "poor experimental statistics prevented us from extracting quantitative dispersion relation of the 1 ev feature .",
    "given that there seems to be multiple transitions contributing to this feature from our calculation , the momentum dependence could be due to changing spectral weight of these transitions .",
    "however , we point out that since the momentum dependent 1  ev feature consists mostly of excitations involving the @xmath8 and @xmath9 orbitals a sizable orbital dependent correlations could exist in the insulating k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 .",
    "these are the same orbitals that are believed to give rise to the observed nematicity in the 122 feas.@xcite the @xmath79 orbital , which was found to go through metal - insulator ( mott ) transition in the superconducting 122 fese samples,@xcite does not make a significant contribution to the 1  ev feature .",
    "our observation seems to lend support to theoretical models that consider both orbital- and spin - fluctuation to contribute to the strong pairing interaction needed for superconductivity.@xcite    we would like to mention that chen and coworkers observed a sharp double - peak structure below 1  ev in their optical conductivity measurements of k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 , which were attributed to arising from the particular magnetic structure.@xcite each fe spin has two types of neighbors in this block antiferromagnetic ordered state : one aligned ferromagnetically and the other antiferromagnetically with the original spin .",
    "intersite @xmath21-excitations to these different spin arrangements have different energies , and the two peak structure in optical spectrum arises from these two transitions .",
    "however , one can not directly compare rixs data with these optical spectroscopy observations due to the difference in the response function these techniques are probing .",
    "rixs follows symmetry selection rules of raman scattering , and mostly sensitive to _ intrasite _ @xmath21-excitation , rather than _ intersite _ @xmath21-excitation .",
    "perhaps this is the reason why we observe only one peak in our rixs data , since local @xmath21-excitation should always satisfy the spin - selection rule .",
    "next , we compare the current results with previous fe @xmath0-edge rixs experiment on prfeaso.@xcite overall spectra bear many similarities , but there are some differences .",
    "first , in both systems a non - dispersive excitation at 3 - 5 ev was found .",
    "the fe @xmath12 interband transition energy is also higher in k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 by about 600 mev , when compared to prfeaso.@xcite in addition , the higher incident energy used in the study of prfeaso seems to suppress the intensity of the fe @xmath12 interband transitions . as a result ,",
    "the 3 - 5 ev feature in prfeaso was mostly associated with ct . in k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3",
    "we also find in our 70-orbital model a non dispersive fe - se @xmath71 ct excitation in the same energy interval ( 3 - 7 ev ) as the fe @xmath12 interband transition .",
    "however , the ct excitation could not be resolved in our rixs spectrum and is instead hidden under the strong fe @xmath12 interband transition . secondly , although in both k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 and prfeaso a low energy @xmath21-excitation with a dominant @xmath9 and @xmath8 orbital character is found , their behaviour with momentum are quite different .",
    "whereas in prfeaso the @xmath21-excitation is present at the @xmath49-point and disperses towards higher energy ( bandwidth @xmath80 ev ) with increasing in - plane momentum , the 1  ev feature in k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 is much weaker at the @xmath49-point and exhibits very small dispersion when in - plane momentum is increased . since the dispersion of the @xmath21-excitation in prfeaso was associated with local magnetic correlations , reflecting the collinear antiferromagnetic order , we speculate that the lack of much momentum dependence of the 1  ev feature might be influenced by the different magnetic ordering pattern .    finally , it is quite illuminating to compare the rixs spectra in fe based superconductors and cuprates .",
    "the most prominent difference between the rixs spectra of these two families of compounds is the difference in scattering cross - section .",
    "cuprate rixs spectra usually show prominent and well - defined charge - transfer excitations between 2 - 7 ev , while iron based materials do not show such a well defined feature .",
    "this contrast can be ascribed to the difference in the hybridization of the respective @xmath7-orbitals . in cuprates",
    "the spatial overlap between cu @xmath81 orbitals and oxygen @xmath82 orbitals is quite large , and the hybridization is sizable . in the cu @xmath0-edge process in cuprates",
    "the screening of the cu @xmath38 core hole is mainly provided by the charge transfer from the oxygen @xmath62 orbitals , resulting in salient features associated with the charge - transfer excitation in the spectra . on the other hand , in iron based superconductors fe @xmath7 orbitals are in tetrahedral environment of pnictogen or chalcogen atoms , the hybridization between orbitals from the two sites is thus much smaller . in addition , the tetrahedral environment allows on - site fe @xmath83 hybridization .",
    "therefore , there exist more channels to screen the @xmath38 core hole in the fe @xmath0-edge rixs experiment , since fe @xmath7 , @xmath62 , and se @xmath62 states are all available for the screening . as a result ,",
    "the spectral features are all quite weak and perhaps there are more contributions than one dominant charge - transfer excitation .",
    "another consequence of the fe @xmath84 hybridization is the large fluorescence signal in iron compounds .",
    "since significant fe @xmath12 density of states are found near the fermi level , fluorescence occurs at low energy transfer , which overlaps with the rixs features . on the other hand , cu @xmath12 dos is far away from the fermi level in cuprates , and does not usually interfere with the rixs spectra .",
    "for these two reasons , rixs investigation of iron based superconductors are much more challenging .",
    "depending on the specific spectral feature one wants to focus on , a judicious choice of incident energy should be considered in the experimental design process .",
    "we have successfully measured charge excitations in the insulating k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 using fe @xmath0-edge resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) .",
    "our key observation is the appearance of a sharp excitation around 1 ev when the incident energy is tuned to the pre - edge , as well as a broad spectral feature around 3 - 7 ev .",
    "this low energy @xmath21-excitation shows clear momentum dependence of the spectral weight and line shape , while the high energy peak is due to fe @xmath12 interband transitions .",
    "calculations based on 70 orbital model , using a moderate @xmath85 ev , indicate that the 1  ev feature originates from the correlated fe 3@xmath7 electrons with a dominant @xmath8 and @xmath9 orbital character , emphasizing the importance of those orbitals across different families of iron based superconductors .",
