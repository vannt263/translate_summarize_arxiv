    "the measured properties of the recently discovered 125 gev higgs boson @xcite are in a very good agreement with the standard model ( sm ) predictions",
    ". the experimental errors , however , are still large enough and to various deviations from the sm can still be accommodated .",
    "in fact , theoretical considerations on the radiative stability of the higgs boson mass are widely considered as a major motivation for new physics beyond the sm , which ameliorates the fine - tuning between the bare higgs mass and the quadratically divergent radiative correction .",
    "the radiative stability of the higgs mass is typically attributed to a new symmetry such as softly - broken supersymmetry @xcite or spontaneously broken global symmetry as in the little higgs models @xcite .",
    "these extensions of the sm predict new particles which contribute to the radiatively corrected higgs mass , cancelling quadratically divergent contributions from the sm particles , most notably , the top quark contribution . within the supersymmetric models this role is played by the sub - tev spin-0 top partner , the top squark , while in little higgs models the top partner is a spin-1/2 vector - like quark .",
    "the search for top partners , therefore , is an important task , as it may shed light on the long standing naturalness problem @xcite .",
    "compared with the scalar top partners , the fermionic top partner has larger production rate and simpler decay modes at colliders than the scalar top partner of the same mass .",
    "constraints from the direct fermionic top partner pair production searches have been presented by the atlas and cms at 7 + 8 tev lhc .",
    "the bound on the top partner mass is sensitive to branching ratios of the top partner decays into different final states @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the top partner with the mass less than @xmath6 gev were shown to be excluded @xcite .",
    "different strategies have been suggested to improve the discovery sensitivity of the top partners . for improved analysis of top partner pair production processes",
    "the use of the jet substructure technique were proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . if the top partner mass in the range of @xmath7 gev , single top partner production can have larger cross section than the pair production and , hence , it may be more favourable to look for singly produced top partners at the lhc @xcite .",
    "in addition to direct searches one can exploit indirect searches for the top partners through their contribution to the electroweak precision observables @xcite and flavor physics @xcite . also , since top partner is naturally related to the higgs physics , one can obtain constraints from the higgs data @xcite .",
    "the indirect searches become increasingly important for heavy top partners , which may not be directly observable at the lhc .",
    "the study of indirect effects of top partners are of great importance for future colliders as well .    in this work",
    ", we will study a simplified fermionic top partner model , which can be considered as the top sector of the littlest higgs ( lh ) model @xcite .",
    "there are many phenomenological works devoted to study it before the discovery of the higgs boson .",
    "we perform a state - of - the - art global fit to obtain the indirect constraints on fermionic top partner with a comprehensive way .",
    "this method was widely used in the fit of the sm to the electroweak precision data and has been recently used in the studies of the parameters space of the supersymmetric models , such as cmssm , pmssm and nmssm .",
    "so , it will be also meaningful to explore what might happen in a fermionic top partner model with a global fit at future colliders .",
    "our study may play a complementary role to the direct searches in probing top partner .",
    "more importantly , by building an overall likelihood function for the constraints from the higgs data , @xmath0 measurements and the electroweak precision observables , we can obtain a well - defined statistical results of the exclusion limit on the top partner . on the other hand",
    ", we explore the potential of constraining the top partner from the future higgs couplings measurements at tlep .",
    "the proposed tlep @xmath8 collider @xcite could be located in a new 80 to 100 km tunnel in the geneva area .",
    "it would be able to produce collisions at 4 interaction points with @xmath9 from 90 to 350 gev and beyond and is expected to make precision measurements at the @xmath10 pole , at the @xmath11 threshold , at the @xmath12 cross section maximum , and at the @xmath13 threshold , with an unprecedented accuracy .",
    "the luminosity expected at tlep is between a factor 5 and 3 orders of magnitude larger than that expected for a linear collider , such as ilc and clic . in light of the high luminosity",
    ", tlep can allow to measure the higgs couplings to percent level , such as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which are sensitive to the possible new physics that can reduce the fine - tuning of the higgs boson mass .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give a brief description of the simplified fermionic top partner model . in section iii",
    ", we present the numerical results and discussions .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions in section iv .",
    "the generic structure of the littlest higgs models employs a global symmetry broken at a tev scale , where new particles cancel divergences from the sm particles in the higgs mass calculation @xcite .",
    "an extended gauge and scalar interactions in the full theory contribute to the fine - tuning in a rather complicated and model - dependent way @xcite .",
    "the most relevant for the higgs mass naturalness problem , however , is the top quark sector .",
    "therefore , we can simplify the top quark sector of the littlest higgs model based on non - linear realization , where an extra global @xmath16 symmetry is dynamically broken down to @xmath17 at a scale @xmath18 by some unspecified strong dynamics .",
    "the low - energy non - linear field which spans the coset @xmath19 is defined as : @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the broken generators ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 are the corresponding goldstone bosons .",
    "four of these goldstone states are combined into the sm electroweak higgs doublet @xmath24 , while the remaining singlet does not play any role in our analysis and we ignore it in what follows .",
    "the top quark yukawa coupling is generated by the following interactions @xcite , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is an @xmath16 triplet of left - handed weyl fermions , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are two @xmath16 singlet right - handed weyl fermions . while the first term in eq.([top - yukawa ] ) is @xmath29symmetric , the second term explicitly violates @xmath16 global invariance and , hence , the higgs mass is generated through the radiative corrections owing to this violating term .",
    "after the electroweak symmetry breaking , the top mass terms are given by , @xmath30 with @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the vev of higgs field .",
    "the mass matrix eq.([mass ] ) can be diagonalized by rotating the weak eigenstates @xmath34 to the mass eigenstates @xmath35 , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are identified with the sm top quark and the top partner respectively . in the mass egeinstate , the eq.([top - yukawa ] ) becomes @xmath39 with @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the sm top yukawa coupling and @xmath42 is the mass of the top partner .",
    "note that , due to the known top quark mass , the three free parameters ( @xmath43 and @xmath18 ) are reduced to two , which can be chosen as two physical parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 . while the left - handed mixing angle @xmath46 can be given in terms of @xmath44 and @xmath45 as @xmath47 .",
    "it is clear that the potentially dangerous quadratic divergent contribution to the higgs mass due to the top quark loop coming from the first term in eq.([a ] ) is cancelled by the top partner loops originated from the next two terms .",
    "the dominant negative log - divergent correction to the higgs mass squared from the top and @xmath48 loops is given by @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the uv cut - off of the model .",
    "then the fine - tuning can be quantified by the following parameter : @xmath51 here @xmath52 is the higgs boson mass .",
    "since the main focus of this phenomenological model is on the naturalness problem of the higgs mass , we simply assume that the gauge sector is the same as the one in the sm .",
    "with respect to the sm predictions . ]",
    "the low - energy effects of the underlying strongly coupled sector of the full theory is parameterized by dimension-6 operators @xcite , @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are dimensionless couplings and are expected to be of order 1 .",
    "these interactions contribute to the electroweak scale observables .",
    "in our numerical calculations we take the following sm input parameters @xcite : @xmath56 a light top partner with mass around weak scale is welcomed by the naturalness , however , it has already been excluded by the electroweak precision observables alone . for similar reason ,",
    "a small or large mixing angle @xmath44 is also not favored .",
    "besides , a large @xmath44 can cause a significant deviation of the result of @xmath0 from the sm prediction .",
    "so , in our calculations , we require @xmath57 gev and @xmath58 in our scan .",
    "although there are no a explicit values of uv couplings and the variation of these couplings will have some effects on the observables , the natural values of these couplings in the unknown strong interaction sector should be order one .",
    "we take @xmath59 for simplicity .",
    "our global fit is based on the frequentist theory . for a set of observables @xmath60 ,",
    "the experimental measurements are assumed to be gaussian distributed with the mean value @xmath61 and error @xmath62 .",

    "the confidence regions are evaluated with the profile - likelihood method from tabulated values of @xmath67 . in two dimensions ,",
    "68.3% confidence regions are given by @xmath68 and 95.0% confidence regions by @xmath69 . in our fit , we vary the mixing angle @xmath44 and top partner mass @xmath45 within the following ranges , @xmath70 the likelihood function @xmath71 $ ] is constructed from the following constraints :    * the electroweak precision observables : @xmath72 , @xmath48 and @xmath73 . similar to the littlest higgs , firstly , the top partner can correct the propagators of the electroweak gauge bosons at one - loop level , which is given by @xcite , @xmath74 \\\\",

    "but these are rarely quoted in experimental publications . in this case , all channels considered in the analysis are treated equally , i.e. @xmath89 . we confront the modified higgs - gauge interactions @xmath14 , @xmath90 and @xmath15 within our model with the higgs data by calculating the @xmath91 of the higgs sector using the public package @xcite , which includes 81 data sets from the atlas , cms , cdf and d0 collaborations .",

    "it can be seen that the combined indirect constraints can exclude the top partner mass up to about 830 gev at 95% c.l .. this bound is much stronger than the lower limit set by the atlas direct searches for the @xmath17 singlet top partner , @xmath94 gev @xcite .",
    "the allowed low values of @xmath45 are around @xmath95 , where top partner contribution to the oblique parameters is minimised .",
    "however , it is worth noting that a light top partner with the large mixing angle is strongly disfavoured by the latest result of @xmath0 , which provides more stringent bound than the constraint from the oblique parameters . in ref.@xcite",
    ", the authors also showed the constraint on the top partner but only from the electroweak precision data . while we present a combined bound on the top partner from the building of an overall likelihood for the electroweak precision observables , higgs data and @xmath0 measurements .",
    "so , the lower bound on the top partner is pushed up from about 500 gev to 830 gev .",
    "allowed range in fig.[amt ] .",
    "the dash - dot lines represent the expected measurement uncertainties at hl - lhc @xcite.,width=384,height=336 ]    in fig.[couplings ] , we show the relative shifts of the higgs couplings for the above samples in the @xmath1 range and compare them with the corresponding expected measurement uncertainties of the higgs couplings at lhc14 with a luminosity of 3000 @xmath96 @xcite . the fine - tuning for each point",
    "is also calculated by using the measure in eq.([finetuning ] ) . from fig.[couplings ] , we observe the following : ( 1 ) the values of the fine - tuning for the samples are constrained to be smaller than about 9% by the global fit ; ( 2 ) since the higgs - gauge couplings are suppressed by the common factor @xmath97 , the correction to @xmath98 is always negative in the given model . also , the loop - induced couplings @xmath99 and @xmath100 are reduced due to the cancellation between top quark and the top partner contributions ; ( 3 ) all the higgs couplings deviate from the sm predictions at a percent level .",
    "thus , the future measurements of the @xmath99 coupling at the hl - lhc will be able to exclude the fermionic top partner with @xmath101 tev .",
    "this corresponds to the fine - tuning being lager than about 2% .",
    "the measurements of @xmath100 couplings , can only mildly improve the limits on the top partner mass , while measurements of the top quark yukawa coupling will not provide further constraint on the top partner mass due to the large uncertainties in its determination at the hl - lhc .",
    "note that , in ref.@xcite , the authors calculated the normalized events for @xmath102 and @xmath103 but without imposing any constraints on the plane of @xmath104 from the experimental data . actually , some regions with fine tuning @xmath105 have already been excluded by our studied observables . on the contrary , in fig.2 ,",
    "we require our samples to satisfy the combined constraints at @xmath1 level , then calculate the fine tuning for each points in the allowed region .",
    "so , we found that the suppression of the couplings of @xmath14 and @xmath15 are at most 10% and the parameter space with fine tuning @xmath106 has been strongly disfavored by the current data .     allowed range in fig.[amt],width=288,height=240 ]    in fig.[br ] we show the branching ratios of various decays of the top partner .",
    "the cyan region is excluded by the global fit at @xmath1 level . in the allowed red region , we can find that the branching ratio of @xmath2 is bounded between 14% and 25% .",
    "the branching ratio for @xmath107 decay can be competitive to the one of @xmath108 for the mixing angle @xmath109 and can reach up to 57% . for larger @xmath44 the branching ratio of @xmath108 increases and becomes the main decay mode for @xmath110 .",
    "we note that , in ref.@xcite , the authors have given the strong bounds on the top partner mass ranging from @xmath111 gev to @xmath112 gev at 95% c.l . by combining results of specific @xmath2 and @xmath113 searches , which is across the entire space of branching ratios . as a complementary to this direct bound ,",
    "our results seem stronger than theirs due to the combination of the recent indirect measurements .",
    "so , under the current constraints , @xmath108 and @xmath107 might be the most promising channels for searching for the fermionic top partner at the lhc .    in fig.[tlep",
    "] we present the prospect of improving the constraints on top partner at discussed future higgs factory tlep with @xmath114 gev . at @xmath114 gev",

    "we use the snowmass higgs working group results to simply estimate the exclusion limits @xcite .",
