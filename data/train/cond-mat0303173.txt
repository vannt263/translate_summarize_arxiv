    "since mandelbrot attracted people s attention to the fractals in the 60 s and 70 s @xcite , scientists began to take auto - similarity and scaling invariance as fundamental rules of nature . in the description of second order phase transitions , widom s homogeneity hypothesis @xcite and kadanoff s real space renormalization group scheme @xcite are based on the invariance of the physical behavior under any change of scale at the criticality where the correlation length is divergent .",
    "the validity of these hypothesis and scheme has been verified in different systems with an integer dimension which possess a translational symmetry @xcite . as a matter of fact , a system with translational symmetry is auto - similar and can be considered as a particular case of fractal .",
    "fractals are natural candidates to represent systems with non - integer dimensions .",
    "it turns out to be of fundamental relevance to know if the hypothesis and the scheme mentionned above still work on a _ general _ fractal system , where the translational symmetry is lost and replaced by scale invariance .",
    "the critical behavior of the ising model on fractal lattices has been firstly studied by gefen and his co - workers in the 80 s @xcite .",
    "their works were based on the migdal - kadanoff bond - moving renormalization method and showed that the topological features of the fractals plays an important role in the determination of the critical behavior . as a main result , they found that a phase transition at non - zero temperature can occur only if the fractal has an infinite ramification order .",
    "later , bonnier _ et al .",
    "_ used an alternative decimation method @xcite and high - temperature expansions @xcite to study the phase transition on various fractals , namely sierpiski carpets .",
    "they also found that the critical exponents depend on the geometrical properties of the fractal . in the above studies ,",
    "the applied methods are approximative and the results are not always consistent .",
    "moreover , in these theoretical analyses , the spins were placed at the corners of the occupied squares of the sierpiski carpets ; in these cases , the number of spins does nt follow a power law of the lattice size and the hausdorff dimension should not be expected to enter in the description of the critical phenomena on such systems . recently ,",
    "due to the progress in the simulation methods and the growth of the computer power , the critical behavior of the ising model on fractals of hausdorff dimension @xmath6 between 1 and 3 has been studied numerically in a much more precise way @xcite .",
    "the results showed that the finite - size scaling ( fss ) analysis works in the case of fractals , although the convergence towards the thermodynamical limit can be very slow when @xmath7 , and that the hyperscaling law @xmath8 is verified .",
    "moreover , discrepancies with the predictions of the @xmath9-expansions @xcite were observed .",
    "the universality of phase transitions on fractals is said to be weak @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the spins were placed at the center of the occupied squares of the sierpiski carpets in these studies ; consequently , the number of the spins increases as a power law of the lattice size with an exponent equal to the hausdorff dimension @xmath6 . in this case",
    ", @xmath6 takes the place of the space dimension in widom s homogeneity hypothesis because of the conservation of the total free energy under a change of length scale ; the generalization of this hypothesis in the case of fractals is quite straightforward @xcite .",
    "monte carlo renormalization group ( mcrg ) has been shown to be a powerful tool in the study of critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "it combines monte carlo ( mc ) simulation techniques with the analysis of the real space renormalization group ( rsrg ) .",
    "it has been , so far , applied to systems with translational symmetry .",
    "a rsrg analysis involves an infinite number of couplings when dealing with the hamiltonian .",
    "theoreticians usually truncate the number of couplings to a finite one in order to make the calculations tractable .",
    "it , therefore , makes rsrg an approximate method and the accuracy of the results is linked to the number of the couplings considered .",
    "even if only few couplings are considered , the calculations associated with the process of decimation remain tedious . with the aid of mc simulation , a renormalization - group calculation with a larger number of couplings becomes possible and the results are expected to be more reliable.however , some crucial problems are encountered in a mcrg study :    1 .   the critical slowing down : + hypothetically , the accuracy of the thermodynamical averages can be improved by performing a larger number of mc steps to reduce the statistical errors .",
    "in fact , due to the divergence of the correlation length at the criticality , local mc algorithms ( for e.g. , the metropolis one ) suffer from critical slowing down , which hinders the computation of accurate thermodynamical averages .",
    "fortunately , the use of cluster algorithms , for e.g. , the swendsen - wang algorithm @xcite and the wolff algorithm @xcite , enables to improve significantly the efficiency of the simulations .",
    "the finite size effects : + rsrg method involves an infinite size lattice , whereas computer simulations can only be performed on finite size lattices .",
    "one should perform the simulation on several large systems and then extrapolate the results to the infinite one .",
    "the mcrg method , according to which one plays the game of changing the length scale , should be a natural approach to explore the critical behavior of phase transitions on hierarchical lattices .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the critical behavior of the ising model on a sierpiski carpet using the mcrg method .",
    "as far as we know , it is the first time that the mcrg method is used in the case of fractal lattices .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "a 3 by 3 square lattice with its central subsquare removed is chosen as `` generating cell '' .",
    "the sierpiski carpet we deal with is constructed iteratively from this generating cell :    1 .   we take the generating cell as the carpet at the first iteration step and denote it @xmath10 .",
    "2 .   the carpet at the @xmath11-th iteration step @xmath12 is constructed by enlarging three times the size of the carpet at the @xmath13-th iteration step and replacing each enlarged un - removed subsquare by the whole generating cell . this carpet becomes a `` true '' fractal in the mathematical sense when @xmath13 tends to infinity .",
    "the size of the lattice @xmath14 is equal to @xmath15 .",
    "a spin is set at each center of an un - removed subsquare ( so - called occupied square ) .",
    "the number of spins on @xmath14 is therefore equal to @xmath16 .",

    "let us briefly recall the mcrg method.the geometrical structure of a sierpiski carpet remains invariant during a rsrg process involving a change in the length scale from 1 to @xmath20 , provided that @xmath20 is equal to an integer power of the size of its generating cell .",
    "in our case , we set @xmath20 equal to 3 and increase the length scale by this factor at each renormalization step .",

    "the reduced hamiltonian after @xmath23 renormalization steps ( @xmath23 is a positive integer ) reads as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the coupling set after @xmath23 renormalization steps and @xmath26 s are the conjugate lattice sums of the spin products on the reduced network .",
    "the matrix @xmath27 , which describes the flow of the couplings from the @xmath23-th renormalization step to the @xmath28-th one , is defined by @xmath29 and satisfies the following relation : @xmath30^{(n+1,n)}_{\\gamma\\beta } = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{\\infty}\\ , \\left[\\partial s \\right]^{(n+1,n+1)}_{\\gamma\\alpha}\\ ,   { \\cal t}^{(n+1 , n)}_{\\alpha\\beta } ,   \\label{s_st}\\ ] ] where @xmath31^{(n , m)}_{\\alpha\\beta } \\equiv     \\partial \\langle s^{(n)}_{\\alpha}\\rangle/\\partial k^{(m)}_{\\beta}$ ] can be calculated by @xmath32 .",
    "one can hence calculate the matrix @xmath33 by inverting the above relation .",
    "two critical exponents enable to describe the static scaling properties of the system : the temperature eigen - exponent @xmath3 and the magnetic one @xmath2 .",
    "they describe respectively the scaling behavior of the reduced temperature @xmath34 ( where @xmath1 is the critical temperature ) and the external magnetic field @xmath35 near the criticality under a change of the length unit from @xmath36 to @xmath20 : @xmath37 @xmath38 and @xmath39 are associated with the two relevant directions of the renormalization flows and can be obtained by finding the largest eigenvalues of the @xmath33 matrix in the even- and odd - coupling subspaces , respectively .",
