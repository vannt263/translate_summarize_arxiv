    "heavy flavor is one of the important probes for the hot dense nuclear matter created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite . unlike the light flavors , heavy flavor was expected to be much less thermalized in the matter due to the relatively smaller cross section .",
    "however , it was found that @xmath5 of heavy flavor is much suppressed in the intermediate and high transverse momentum region and that its @xmath2 is not small @xcite .",
    "this implies that charm quarks , which comprise the majority of heavy flavors produced in heavy - ion collisions , are considerably thermalized . on the other hand ,",
    "charm quarks never reach chemical equilibrium due to too small cross section for the annihilation or the creation of the @xmath0 pair .",
    "in fact , the measured number of @xmath0 pairs in au+au collision at rhic is almost proportional to the number of binary collisions @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamics , which is based on conservation of the energy - momentum and various kind of charges , was found to be successful in reproducing the @xmath6 spectrum and the elliptic flow of bulk particles in relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "additionally , from the fact that the number of charm pairs is almost conserved in the fireball @xcite , one can introduce the charge of charm pairs .",
    "this charge is different from the charge of charm flavor , which is zero throughout the space - time of the collision as the the same number of anticharm quarks cancels the charm charge .",
    "once the charge is introduced , its transport can be described in hydrodynamics assuming that the charm quark interact strongly with the matter .",
    "the flow velocity of heavy flavor is a key ingredient in the @xmath2 of open charms as well as that of the charmonia . in most cases ,",
    "the flow velocity is assumed same as that of the bulk particles or is just parameterized according to a given assumption @xcite . in this study",

    "the mean radial distance of heavy flavor is smaller than that of the bulk matter by 10@xmath115 % .",

    "the fraction gives valuable information on the thermal properties of @xmath4 as well as of the hot nuclear matter created in relativistic heavy - ion collision .",
