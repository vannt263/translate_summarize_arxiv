    "_ this work was presented on `` the eighth european conference on atomic and molecular physics '' ( ecampviii ) ( rennes , france , july 6 - 10 , 2004 ) and on the `` electronic structure simulations of nanostructures '' workshop ( essn2004 ) ( jyvskyl finland , june 18 - 21 , 2004 ) . _ +   + amino acids are building blocks for proteins .",
    "recently , it became possible to study experimentally fragments of proteins , i.e. chains of amino acids , in a gas phase with the use of the maldi mass spectroscopy @xcite . _",
    "ab initio _ theoretical investigations of amino acid chains began also only recently @xcite and are still in its infancy .",
    "we have investigated the potential energy surface for neutral and charged alanine and glycine chains consisting of up to 6 amino acids . for these molecules",
    "we have calculated potential energy surfaces as a function of the ramachandran angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 often used for the characterization of the polypeptide chains @xcite .",
    "our calculations are performed within _ ab initio _ theoretical framework based on the density functional theory and also within semi - empirical model approaches .",
    "we have demonstrated that the excessive positive charge of the system influences strongly its geometrical and conformational properties",
    ". with increasing of the excessive charge amino acid chains become unstable and decay into two or more fragments .",
    "we have analysed how the secondary structure of polypeptide chains influences the formation of the potential energy landscapes .",
    "we have calculated the energy barriers for transitions between different molecular conformations and determined the ones being energetically the most favourable .",
    "our exploration of the potential energy surface of alanine and glycine chains is based on the density - functional theory ( dft ) accounting for all electrons in the system and on the semiempirical am1 method @xcite .    within the dft one has to solve the kohn - sham equations , which read as",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) :    @xmath2    where the first term represents the kinetic energy of the @xmath3-th electron , and @xmath4 describes its attraction to the ions in the cluster , @xmath5 is the hartree part of the interelectronic interaction : @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the electron density : @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the local exchange - correlation potential , @xmath10 are the electronic orbitals and @xmath11 is the number of electrons in the cluster .",
    "the exchange - correlation potential is defined as the functional derivative of the exchange - correlation energy functional : @xmath12}{\\delta \\rho(\\vec r)},\\ ] ]    the approximate functionals employed by dft methods partition the exchange - correlation energy into two parts , referred to as exchange and correlation parts .",
    "both parts are the functionals of the electron density , which can be of two distinct types : either local functional depending on only the electron density @xmath13 or gradient - corrected functionals depending on both @xmath13 and its gradient , @xmath14 . in literature",
    ", there is a variety of exchange correlation functionals . in our work",
    "we use the becke s three parameter gradient - corrected exchange functional with the gradient - corrected correlation functional of lee , yang and parr ( b3lyp ) @xcite .",
    "we utilize the standard 6 - 311++g(d , p ) and 6 - 31g(2d , p ) basis set to expand the electronic orbitals @xmath10 .",
    "in figure [ angles ] we show the dihedral angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 that are used to characterize the potential surface of the polypeptide chain .",
    "in figure [ geom_neutral ] we present the optimized geometries of the alanine and glycine polypeptide chains that have been used for the exploration of the potential energy surface .",
    "all geometries were optimized with the b3lyp density functional .",
    "we used the 6 - 31++g(d , p ) and 6 - 31g(2d , p ) basis sets to expand the electronic orbitals in the molecule .      in figure [ ala_x3_minima ]",
    "we show the optimized structures of the alanine tripeptide .",
    "different geometries correspond to the minima on the potential energy surface ( see contour plot in figure [ map_ala_x3 ] ) .    in figure [ gly_x3_minima ]",
    "we show the optimized structures of the glycine tripeptide .",
    "different geometries correspond to the minima on the potential energy surface ( see contour plot in figure [ map_gly_x3 ] ) .    in figure [ gly_x6_minima_helix ]",
    "we show the optimized structures of the glycine hexapeptide in helix conformation .",
    "different geometries correspond to the minima on the potential energy surface ( see contour plot in figure [ map_gly_x6_helix ] ) .        in figure [ ramachandranexp ]",
    "we show the distribution of observed dihedral angles @xmath0 , @xmath1 of non - glycine residues in protein structures selected from the brookhaven protein data bank @xcite .",
