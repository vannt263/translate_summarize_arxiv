    "the majority voter ( mv ) model is a simple non - equilibrium ising - like system that presents an order - disorder phase transition in regular and complex lattices .",
    "numerical results for the critical exponents , obtained on two - dimensional square lattices  @xcite and in three dimensional cubic lattice  @xcite .",
    "are the same as those of the ising model .",
    "those results seem to confirm the conjecture that non equilibrium models with up - down symmetry and spin flip dynamics fall in the universality class of the equilibrium ising model  @xcite . however , the critical exponents obtained in numerical simulations on non - regular lattices  @xcite , hypercubic lattices above four dimensions  @xcite and two dimensional regular lattices with honeycomb and triangular geometries  @xcite are different from the computed for the ising model in the same geometries .    on the other hand the critical points reported for the mv model in refs .  @xcite and @xcite seem to indicated a non monotonic behavior as function of the number of nearest neighbors ( @xmath0 ) in the lattice , the critical point for the square lattice ( @xmath1 ) is bigger than those of the triangular ( @xmath2 ) and the honeycomb ( @xmath3 ) lattices .",
    "this behavior clearly differs from the present in the ising model for the same geometries , even if we include the result for the bilayer square lattice ( @xmath4 )  @xcite , where the inverse critical temperature @xmath5 is a monotonic decreasing function on @xmath0 .",
    "we aim to clarify if the mv model belongs to the ising model universality class in regular lattices and study the critical point dependence on the number of nearest neighbors in this model . in order to achieve our goals",
    "we evaluate the critical points and the critical exponents for two dimensional lattices in three different regular geometries : the honeycomb , the triangular and the bilayer square lattice .",
    "as mentioned above the mv model is an ising - like system , in the sense that consists of a set of up - down `` spins '' , each one located on a lattice site that interact , in this work , with its nearest neighbors .",
    "the system evolves in the following way : during an elementary time step , an spin @xmath6 on the lattice is randomly picked up , and flipped with a probability given by @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the local field produced by the nearest neighbors to the @xmath9  th spin and @xmath10 is the control parameter ( noise ) .",

    "we assume that the same scaling forms used in the equilibrium models can be applied for the mv model .",
    "so , we will have a free energy density given by the scaling ansatz @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the critical point for the infinite system , @xmath28 is the dimension of the system , @xmath29 is a universal function , @xmath30 is the symmetry - breaking ( magnetic ) field and @xmath31 is the linear dimension ( @xmath32 for the honeycomb and triangular lattices and @xmath33 for the two - layer lattice ) .",
