    "phase separation and partitioning driven by excluded volume interactions have been well studied theoretically @xcite , with the inspiration coming from experiments both on synthetic colloidal systems @xcite and on biologically derived systems @xcite . when excluded volume effects are dominant the properties of a mixture are determined solely by the sizes and shapes of its components .",
    "for example , mixtures of long narrow rod - like particles and spheres have been shown to demix solely because of these differences in size and shape @xcite .",
    "the rod - like particles could be a minimal model of a semiflexible polymer or of a micelle , and the spheres could be small colloidal particles or even compact protein molecules .",
    "but if the semiflexible polymer is very long then even a single , isolated molecule can undergo phase transitions @xcite , because it is then large enough , has enough degrees of freedom , to be treated as a thermodynamic system @xcite . here",
    "we study such a polymer , mixed with spheres , and see if the presence of the spheres can induce a phase transition .",
    "we find that they can .",
    "when the concentration of spheres exceeds a critical value the polymer molecule contracts and expels the spherical particles . in effect the polymer molecule and the spheres are demixing .",
    "the mixture of many short rod - like polymers and spheres demixed to form a phase with a high density of rod - like polymers but a low density of spheres ( coexisting with one with high sphere density and low rod density ) and here the polymer contracts to form a dense globule with a high density of polymer but a low density of spheres",
    ". this dense phase of a polymer is referred to as the globular phase @xcite and the contraction of the polymer is the coil  globule transition .    in the work presented here",
    ", we will draw on existing theories for the demixing of spheres and semiflexible polymers @xcite and for the coil ",
    "globule transition @xcite . the theory for the mixture of spheres and semiflexible polymers",
    "@xcite is a straightforward virial expansion of the helmholtz free energy , truncated after the second virial coefficient terms . in the free energy expressions of ref .",
    "@xcite the two components of the mixture were treated symmetrically . while this is of course perfectly valid , here we want to use the analogy between demixing and the vapour  liquid phase separation of a pure substance @xcite .",
    "to do this we will legendre transform @xcite the helmholtz free energy into a semi - grand potential @xcite .",
    "this semi - grand potential is then a function of the density of the polymer and the chemical potential of the spheres . a chemical potential , like the temperature , is uniform throughout any system at equilibrium ; it is a field variable not a density .",
    "so , the semi - grand potential has the same form as the helmholtz free energy of a polymer which interacts via interactions which are not solely excluded volume and so depend on temperature .",
    "both depend on the density of polymer and on a field variable : temperature in the case of a polymer with soft interactions , and the chemical potential of the spheres for the polymer mixed with spheres .",
    "in particular , both thermodynamic functions can be expanded as a virial series in the density of polymer with coefficients which depend on temperature / chemical potential of the spheres .",
    "just as reducing the temperature of a polymer molecule with attractive interactions can make some of its virial coefficients negative , increasing the chemical potential of spheres drives some of the virial coefficients of the semi - grand potential of the mixture of polymer and spheres negative . in both cases",
    "the effect is the same : the polymer contracts from the coil state to the globular state .",
    "the spheres have in effect induced an attraction , often called a depletion attraction , between the segments of the polymer molecule .",
    "the interactions between the segments of a polymer molecule determines its state .",
    "note that we always consider a single , isolated polymer molecule . if the interactions between the polymer segments are repulsive , the good solvent regime , then the polymer exists as a swollen coil @xcite .",
    "the radius of gyration of the polymer , a measure of its size , scales with the number of segments @xmath0 as @xmath1 ( actually the exponent is slightly less than @xmath2 @xcite ) .",
    "so , the volume occupied by the polymer molecule scales as @xmath3 . the exponent is greater than one and so the average density of segments inside this volume tends to 0 as @xmath0 tends to infinity .",
    "however , if the interactions between the segments of the polymer are sufficiently attractive , the poor solvent regime , the polymer exists in a condensed state , the globular state @xcite . there",
    "the radius of gyration of the polymer scales as @xmath4 and so as @xmath0 tends to infinity the average density inside the polymer remains non - zero .",
    "the crossover from the radius of gyration scaling as @xmath1 to @xmath4 marks the coil ",
    "globule transition .",
    "motivation for studying the current model mixture is provided by an interest in the phase behaviour of long dna double helices .",
    "the dna double helix is a semiflexible polymer , its persistence length @xcite is @xmath5 nm @xcite which is 25 times its diameter of @xmath6 nm .",
    "our semiflexible polymer with only excluded volume interactions is a crude model of dna in a good solvent @xcite .",
    "our model mixture is then a crude but not unreasonable model of a long dna molecule in a suspension of spherical particles , in the absence of any specific dna ",
    "spherical - particle attraction .",
    "thus , our results imply that dna can be condensed using colloidal spheres . as far as we are aware",
    "this has not been attempted .",
    "however , there are a number of experimental techniques for condensing dna , such as altering the solvent , adding polyvalent salts etc . , see refs . @xcite and references therein .",
    "however , all these techniques produce a sudden collapse of the dna to a dense state in which the separation between adjacent parts of the dna is only a few nm and the dna has hexagonal order .",
    "the collapse induced by the colloidal spheres is continuous and and it is then possible to prepare a low density isotropic globule of dna . as far as we are aware this is the only way of preparing a low density globule of a semiflexible polymer such as dna .",
    "our system may also be useful as a very crude model of the effect of ` macromolecular crowding ' on dna actually in cells , see refs . @xcite and references therein .",
    "the polymer is modeled by a homogeneous cylindrical elastic filament @xcite .",
    "the filament follows a continuous curve in space , see fig .",
    "1 . the filament bends and flexes during thermal motion",
    "but it has a certain amount of rigidity , measured by its persistence length @xmath7 @xcite . a piece of polymer shorter than the persistence length only bends by a small amount due to thermal motion",
    ", it behaves almost like a rigid rod .",
    "the polymer has a hard core of diameter @xmath8 , that is the centreline of the polymer can not approach within @xmath8 of itself .",
    "the polymer is @xmath0 persistence lengths long ; in our calculations we will always consider the limit of @xmath9 .",
    "the colloidal spheres are modeled by hard spheres with a diameter @xmath10 . the polymer ",
    "sphere interaction is also an excluded ",
    "volume interaction .",
    "the centre of a sphere can not approach within @xmath11 of the centreline of the polymer .",
    "we only consider explicitly the globular state of a single isolated polymer molecule in the @xmath9 limit .",
    "we also neglect any variation in the density of polymer segments in the globule ; the volume approximation of lifshitz and coworkers @xcite .",
    "then the globule is simply a bulk phase of volume @xmath12 in which the @xmath0 polymer segments are distributed with a uniform density @xmath13 . far from the coil ",
    "globule transition and for large @xmath0 this is reasonable , then the globule is expected to resemble a drop of liquid  the density is uniform except for a narrow interfacial region at the surface of the globule .",
    "it should be borne in mind that the assumptions behind our free energy break down at the transition itself .",
    "they provide an estimate of what density of colloidal particles is required to induce a coil  globule transition of the polymer but can not say anything about the critical behaviour at the transition . for a detailed study of the region of the transition ,",
    "see ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "the starting point is a virial expansion of the helmholtz free energy @xmath14 , of a globule , in the @xmath9 limit .",
    "this free energy has had the free energy of the polymer in the ideal coil state subtracted off .",
    "the volume @xmath12 enclosed by the globule includes solvent , which we do not treat explicitly , and colloidal spheres .",
    "these spheres are at a density @xmath15 which is uniform within the globule",
    ". then @xcite @xmath16 + \\rho_s^2b_2^{ss}+\\rho\\rho_sb_2^{ps } , \\label{free1}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 , for @xmath18 the temperature and @xmath19 boltzmann s constant .",
    "the virial coefficients @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the second virial coefficients of the polymer ",
    "polymer , the sphere  sphere and the polymer  sphere interactions , respectively .",
    "we have neglected the contribution of the momentum degrees of freedom as they do not affect the phase behaviour .",
    "it is this which has caused the argument of the logarithm in eq .",
    "( [ free1 ] ) to have dimensions of inverse volume . in the absence of colloid @xmath14 is just equal to the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ free1 ] ) .",
    "this term gives the increase in free energy with density due to the excluded volume interactions .",
    "the entropy cost in compressing a coil into a globule with a finite density @xmath23 is not of order @xmath0 and so is not included in eq .",
    "( [ free1 ] ) .",
    "the virial coefficients are given by @xmath24 @xmath21 is the second virial coefficient of hard spheres of diameter @xmath10 .",
    "the above expression for @xmath22 is the volume a rigid cylinder of diameter @xmath8 excludes to a sphere of diameter @xmath10 .",
    "equation ( [ b2s ] ) for @xmath22 therefore neglects the curvature of the polymer , but so long as @xmath25 the polymer curves gently on a length scale of @xmath10 and this approximation is a mild one .",
    "the second virial coefficient of the polymer ",
    "polymer interactions @xmath20 is obtained by splitting the polymer into segments of length less than @xmath7 but much larger than @xmath8 and then assuming that these interact as rigid rods @xcite .",
    "consider a polymer of length @xmath26 , we split it up into @xmath27 segments of length @xmath28 .",
    "the excluded volume of two cylinders of length @xmath28 is @xmath29 if @xmath30 .",
    "so , the volume excluded to one segment by the others is @xmath31 , and this times the number of segments @xmath27 gives the total excluded volume , @xmath32 . dividing this total excluded volume by @xmath12 and realising that @xmath33 we see that we have obtained the first term in eq .",
    "( [ free1 ] ) .    the volume @xmath12 occupied by",
    "the globule is within a much larger volume of colloidal suspension which acts as a reservoir of colloid , thus fixing its chemical potential .",
    "the density of the colloidal spheres is different inside and outside of a globule , thus it is more convenient to work with not the density of the spheres but their chemical potential , which is of course always uniform . the coil ",
    "globule transition is then brought about by increasing the chemical potential of the spheres .",
    "( this is completely analogous to inducing a coil  globule transition by reducing the temperature . )",
    "the chemical potential @xmath34 is equal to the derivative of the free energy of eq .",
    "( [ free1 ] ) with respect to @xmath15 @xmath35 under conditions of fixed @xmath23 and @xmath36 the correct thermodynamic potential is not the helmholtz free energy but a semigrand potential @xmath37 defined by @xcite @xmath38 using eqs .",
    "( [ free1 ] ) and ( [ mus ] ) this becomes @xmath39 we now go over to reduced units .",
    "two reduced densities are defined : @xmath40 and @xmath41 . for semiflexible chains with @xmath42 the isotropic ",
    "nematic transition occurs between an isotropic phase with @xmath43 and a nematic phase with @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "@xmath45 is the volume fraction of colloid .",
    "hard spheres solidify at a volume fraction close to a half .",
    "we have given the reduced densities at which semiflexible polymers and spheres order as they give a good idea of the densities at which interactions are significant . for densities",
    "much less that those given for the transitions the polymer / fluid of spheres is close to ideal",
    ". then in reduced units , eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) is @xmath46 and eq .",
    "( [ mus ] ) is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a reduced activity of the colloid .",
    "the volume fraction @xmath45 of an ideal gas of colloidal spheres in the absence of polymer is equal to @xmath49 , in the presence of excluded volume interactions @xmath50 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ omega2 ] ) expresses @xmath37 as a function of @xmath15 not @xmath49 . to calculate @xmath37 as a function of @xmath49 we have to solve eq .",
    "( [ zs ] ) for @xmath45 at the specified value of @xmath49 .",
    "this can be done numerically .",
    "the pressure @xmath51 of the globule can be obtained by taking the derivative of @xmath37 , eq .",
    "( [ omega2 ] ) , with respect to @xmath52 .",
    "a mixture is specified by the values of the three length scales : @xmath8 , @xmath7 and @xmath10 .",
    "all interactions are athermal and so the only energy scale is @xmath53 .",
    "phase behaviour is solely determined by dimensionless ratios and the only dimensionless ratios that can be defined are then those between lengths .",
    "the mixture s phase behaviour is determined by two dimensionless ratios of lengths , we choose @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the persistence length of dna is around 50 nm or 25 times its diameter of 2 nm @xcite .",
    "so , we set @xmath56 . the ratio @xmath55 is set equal to 15 for our calculations .",
    "this value is chosen as we estimate ( see below ) that for values of @xmath55 of order 10 the continuous coil - globule transition is not preempted by a collapse to a dense hexagonal globule .",
    "we will return to this point when we discuss our results .    at equilibrium",
    "the pressure is uniform which means that it must be the same inside the globule as in the surrounding colloidal suspension .",
    "a stable globule is then only possible if its pressure equals the pressure of the surrounding suspension , which is given by the @xmath57 limit of the pressure derived from @xmath37 .",
    "local stability also requires that at that value of @xmath52 the pressure is an increasing function of @xmath52 .    in fig .",
    "( 2 ) we have plotted pressure ",
    "density plots at two values of @xmath49 , 0.5 and 1 . at the smaller value of @xmath49",
    "the pressure is a monotonically increasing function of the density of the polymer and so no phase with nonzero @xmath52 , i.e. , no globular phase , is stable . at @xmath58",
    "the polymer exists as a coil .",
    "however , for @xmath59 the pressure first decreases , goes through a minimum and then increases .",
    "so , here the coil state is unstable and the polymer exists at a density given by the condition that its pressure equals the pressure at @xmath57 .",
    "note that @xmath49 can easily be converted into the density of colloid in the suspension outside the globule using the @xmath57 limit of eq .",
    "( [ zs ] ) .    as the chemical potential of the spheres",
    "is increased the slope of the pressure versus @xmath52 curve at @xmath57 goes continuously to zero and then becomes negative .",
    "this corresponds to a continuous coil ",
    "globule transition .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "3 . where we show the density of the globule as a function of @xmath49 .",
    "as the transition is approached from above , i.e. , high values of @xmath60 , the density of the globule goes continuously to zero .",
    "the slope of the pressure curve at @xmath57 is given by the coefficient of the term linear in @xmath52 in the @xmath37  the second virial coefficient term in @xmath37 .",
    "the transition is at the point when this second virial coefficient equals 0 . there",
    "the third virial coefficient is positive and so the @xmath37 of eq .",
    "( [ omega2 ] ) has the same form as the free energy studied by de gennes @xcite .",
    "we have found a continuous coil - globule transition for our semiflexible polymer .",
    "however , experiments on dna @xcite show a first order transition ; as does a theory for polymers of long rigid segments with short ranged attractions @xcite .",
    "the reason for the difference is that the colloidal spheres induce a depletion attraction with a range @xmath61 .",
    "this is not much shorter than the polymer s persistence length , in contrast to the attraction in both the dna in the experiments @xcite and the model of ref .",
    "when the range of the attraction is much less than the persistence length , then the higher order virial coefficients are already negative when the second virial coefficient becomes negative @xcite .",
    "the free energy is then not of the form considered by de gennes and others @xcite , and the continuous transition is preempted by a first order transition to a dense globule with at least nematic ordering .",
    "thus , we predict that if the coil ",
    "globule transition of dna is induced not by altering the quality of the solvent or adding polyvalent ions but by mixing in a colloidal suspension the transition will be continuous not first order .",
    "equation ( [ omega2 ] ) for @xmath37 is only valid when the polymer is in the isotropic phase .",
    "we now check that the transition predicted with this potential is not preempted by a transition to a dense ordered phase .",
    "this is easy to do as the isotropic",
    " nematic transition of ( pure ) semiflexible chains is at a reduced pressure @xmath62 @xcite , much higher than the pressure of the transition we have found , see fig .",
    "there is no possibility of a dense nematic or hexagonal globule forming at this density of the colloid ; the pressure inside any such globule would be much higher than the pressure of the colloidal suspension outside .",
    "note that this conclusion relies on the spheres being large , i.e. , on the ratio @xmath55 being large . at fixed volume fraction of the colloidal suspension",
    ", its pressure varies as @xmath63 . for values of @xmath10 of the order of @xmath8",
    "the situation is very different .",
    "a suspension of spheres of this size can easily be at a pressure equal to the pressure of a dense ( pure ) nematic or hexagonal phase of the polymer .",
    "in addition , the overlap of the excluded volumes of two polymer segments only occurs when the two segments are close , within @xmath64 of each other . by excluded volumes we mean the volumes of space excluded by the polymer segments to the spheres @xcite .",
    "thus the attraction is now short ranged , its range is much less than @xmath7 and we expect a first order transition , as in ref .",
    "@xcite .    finally , in fig .",
    "( 4 ) we show the colloid density inside and outside the globule , as a function of @xmath49 .",
    "we see that for the values of the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 that we have taken , a volume fraction of colloid a little more than 0.15 is required to induce the coil ",
    "globule transition .",
    "the colloid density outside the globule is just that of a fluid of hard spheres at that value of @xmath49 , within the second virial coefficient approximation .",
    "it therefore increases as @xmath49 increases .",
    "the colloid density inside the globule , however , decreases as @xmath49 increases , due to the increasing polymer density of the globule .",
    "we have studied a system of a large , isolated semiflexible polymer molecule in a suspension of spherical particles of diameter an order of magnitude larger than the diameter of the polymer but much much less than the radius of gyration of the polymer .",
    "the solvent for the polymer was good",
    "so we found that at low densities of the spheres the polymer was a swollen coil .",
    "however , as the density of spheres was increased beyond a certain point the polymer underwent a coil  globule transition .",
    "the polymer molecule and the spheres ` demixed ' : the polymer contracted to form a dense phase ( fig .",
    "3 ) partially expelling the spheres ( fig .",
    "the driving force for the coil ",
    "globule transition is the same as that for the demixing into two bulk phases of long rod - like particles and spherical particles @xcite : the excluded volume interaction between the spheres and rods is large and this greatly reduces the volume available to the particles .",
    "the reduction in volume greatly reduces the translational and rotational entropy in phases which have high densities of both rods and spheres , favouring demixing into two phases , each with a high density of one component but a low density of the other .    the coil ",
    "globule transition we have found is continuous .",
    "although flexible polymers such as polystyrene @xcite show a continuous coil ",
    "globule transition , for dna the transition is discontinuous @xcite . the dna coil suddenly collapses to form a dense globule with hexagonal ordering . in the experiments which showed the discontinuous collapse of dna , the transition was brought about by some combination of polyvalent ions , alcohols and small polymer molecules , see refs . @xcite and references therein .",
    "a natural assumption to make is that the collapse to a dense globule is then brought about by a _",
    "short ranged _",
    "attraction , i.e. , two dna helices only attract each other when they are a few nm apart . as discussed by the author in refs .",
    "@xcite , the dramatic collapse to a dense ordered phase is then not surprising , see also refs @xcite .",
    "the depletion attraction between polymer segments due to the presence of the spheres is _ long ranged _ , the range is not of order @xmath8 but of order @xmath10 which is an order of magnitude larger .",
    "it is this difference in range which is changing the coil ",
    "globule transition from discontinuous to continuous . thus adding colloidal particles of size @xmath65 nm or larger to dna may produce a continuous collapse of the dna .",
    "such a continuous collapse has not yet been seen , as far as the author is aware .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank s. fraden for bringing references @xcite to my attention .",
    "this work was started as a royal society fellow at the fom institute amolf in amsterdam .",
    "i would like to thank the royal society for the award of a fellowship and amolf for its hospitality .",
