    "two pulsars with planets have been discovered , in 1992 and 1993 @xcite . in particular psr b1257",
    "+ 12 hosts three planets at distances of the order of the astronomical unit .",
    "a pulsar is a neutron star with a fast spin ( period @xmath0 s ) and surrounded by a magnetosphere that is a powerful source of radio and/or high energy emissions .",
    "( we use also the frequency @xmath1 ) .",
    "precise timing of pulsars show that they spin down at a rate that is typically @xmath2 .",
    "the dissipation of energy of psr b1257 + 12 associated to the spin down is @xmath3 w , where @xmath4 is their momentum of inertia .",
    "it can be compared to the planet s gravitational energy @xmath5",
    "j. if the flux dissipated by the spin down was captured through the planetary radius , the gravitational energy of the planet psr 1257 + 12 `` a '' would be dissipated in only @xmath6 years . even with an inefficient coupling mechanism , can we expect heating , plasma acceleration and radio emissions from the planet , or a modification of its orbit ?",
    "the planets ( with an orbital period @xmath7 a few mn ) are far beyond the light cylinder ; they orbit in the pulsar s wind .",
    "this pulsar wind is an almost radial expansion of ultrarelativistic ( lorentz factor @xmath8 . ) and underdense plasma .",
    "most pulsar wind models @xcite converge on the following facts : this wind is highly magnetized ( @xmath9 ) , the magnetic field is quasi - azimutal ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "it is possibly sub - alfvnic ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , until 100 s of @xmath13 , ( models ) @xmath14 ) .",
    "this last fact means that the planet is not preceded by a shock wave , but it is directly connected to the wind .",
    "then , making simple hypothesis , it is possible to develop a theory of the interaction of the planet with the wind .",
    "the hypothesis are ( 1 ) the plasma is locally uniform and incompressible ( ok at 1st order @xcite )",
    ". it can be non - relativistic @xcite or relativistic flow @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) alfvn waves ( mhd waves carrying mainly magnetic fluctuations ) propagate almost only along the magnetic field ( 3 ) the planet is a conducting body ( maybe because of a ionosphere )    then , a potential drop is established by the plasma flow across the planet .",
    "the potential drop induces a current .",
    "this current is closed along the magnetic field lines , by two stationary alfvn waves called alfvn wings .",
    "this structure is a kind of electric circuit , sketched on see the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ mottez : fig1 ] .",
    "its conductivity along the planet is those of the planet .",
    "its conductivity @xmath15 along the two ribbons of current that extend into space ( the alfvn wings ) is , in the highly relativistic case , approximately equal to the vacuum conductivity @xmath16 then , it is possible @xcite to estimate the total current circulating in the alfvn wings @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mean electric field associated to the unipolar inductor , @xmath19 due to the planet s resistivity ( that is low ) , @xmath20 is the planetary radius , or more generally , the body s radius . for a @xmath21ms psr and an earth - like planet at 0.2 ua , @xmath22 a. it is larger for a standard pulsar ( of period @xmath23s ) , @xmath24 a. for comparison , the pulsar s current i.e. the goldreich - julian current that powers the whole magnetosphere is @xmath25 a. for standard pulsars , the two currents are comparable !",
    "of course , these strong and localized ribbons of electric current are probably unstable .",
    "consequently , they may constitute powerful sources of radio emissions . a priori",
    ", there are two possible regions of emission ( it is nothing more than a conjecture ) ( 1 ) a radio source near the planet .",
    "then , the source does not move in our frame of reference and the emissions might be similar to `` usual '' planetary radio emissions , generally associated to instabilities with @xmath26 , as it happens with the couple jupiter - io @xcite",
    ". it would be difficult to predict the angles of emission .",
    "( 2 ) the radio source is along the alfvn wing , and it is convected with the pulsar s wind .",
    "then , the source is moving fast @xmath27 and the emission is beamed by the relativistic aberration ( see the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ mottez : fig1 ] ) . in that case , the radiation would be well collimated , and it might be observable , under lucky circumstances @xcite .",
    "in the alfvn wing electric circuit , the current density @xmath28 flowing along the planet , crossed with the ambient magnetic field , is the cause of a @xmath29 force density .",
    "the force has a component that is tangential to the orbit .",
    "it gives a non keplerian contribution to the motion .",
    "this force and its effect on the orbit of a body in the pulsar wind can be estimated analytically @xcite .",
    "then , the evolution of the orbital elements can be computed numerically . for planets",
    "this force has a negligible contribution to the orbit .",
    "but it becomes very important when small bodies , like comets , asteroids and planetesimal are concerned .",
    "figure [ mottez : fig2 ] shows the time evolution of the semi - major axis of a 1 km sized rocky body in orbit around a standard pulsar ( pulsar period @xmath30 ) .",
    "the forces acts differently if the orbital spin is parallel or anti - parallel to the neutron star spin .",
    "when they are parallel , the semi - major axis and the eccentricity tend to increase , while they are reduced for anti - parallel spins . in this last case",
    ", we see that a body can be precipitated onto the neutron star in less than 10,000 years .",
    "this effect of the magnetic force on the objects orbiting a pulsar , especially planetesimals , may have important consequences in scenarios of planetary formation after the transformation of the star into a neutron star , from the debris of the supernova .",
