    "the most metal deficient stars in the galaxy provide crucial evidence on the early epochs of star formation , the environments in which various elements were produced , and the production of elements subsequent to the big bang and prior to contributions from lower mass stars to the ism .",
    "the major existing survey for very metal - poor stars is the hk survey described in detail by beers , preston & shectman ( 1985 , 1992 ) .",
    "the stellar inventory of this survey has been scrutinized with considerable care over the past decade .    in this paper",
    "we report the discovery of a peculiar star with highly enhanced abundances of the heavy neutron capture elements , including eu .",
    "he  21481247  was found in the course of exploiting the hamburg / eso survey ( he s ) @xcite to find very metal - poor stars .",
    "we provide a detailed abundance analysis for this star , obtaining results for 27 elements , including many of the neutron capture elements .",
    "we give a progress report on our radial velocity monitoring of he  21481247 , and conclude with a discussion of the implications of its extreme anomalies for galactic nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution , with emphasis on the issue of the efficiency of mass transfer in binary systems and a comparison of the observed abundances in he  21481247  to those predicted under various scenarios .",
    "we present a new version of accretion induced collapse in a binary system with heavy @xmath3-process element production as a plausible explanation for the nucleosynthetic history of he  21481247 .",
    "we rely heavily in the present work on the procedures and atomic data for abundance analyses of very metal poor stars described in our earlier papers reporting the results of the keck pilot program on extremely metal - poor stars from the he s @xcite . at the same time , the spectrum of he  21481247 , as well as those of more than 30 additional very metal poor stars selected from the he s whose spectra we have recently acquired , was observed with a slight variant of the instrumental configuration utilized for the keck pilot program .",
    "thus we provide additional details of the procedures to be applied for the analysis of the spectrum of he  21481247 , which will also be used for the spectra of very metal poor stars now in hand .",
    "the motivation for studying extremely metal poor stars using the he s is reviewed in @xcite .",
    "when our dataset for very metal poor stars now in hand is analyzed , we will be able to address in detail the issue of the scatter in abundance ratios among various elements from star to star and to constrain the nucleosynthetic processes operating .",
    "however , only two of the @xmath040 high dispersion spectra of newly discovered very metal poor stars from the he s that taken thus far at keck show easily detected lines of the key element eu .",
    "one of these stars , he  21481247 , is such an interesting object that we felt a full analysis should be presented as soon as possible .",
    "the star he  21481247 , at coordinates r.a.@xmath4 and @xmath5 , was selected as a candidate extremely metal - poor star from the he s using automatic spectral classification @xcite . a moderate resolution ( @xmath6 )",
    "spectrum was taken on november 18 , 1999 , with the 3.5 m new technology telescope at the european southern observatory , la silla , chile .",
    "that spectrum confirmed the star to be very metal - poor , and it was therefore observed at the keck telescope using hires @xcite on sep .",
    "28 and 30 , 2001 . six 1200 sec exposures were obtained the first night , and five more the second , for a total exposure time of 13,200 sec .",
    "the star was moved slightly along the slit between each exposure .",
    "the observations were carried out with the slit at the parallactic angle .",
    "a spectral resolution of 45,000 was achieved using a 0.86 arcsec wide slit projecting to 3 pixels in the hires focal plane ccd detector . as the last order to the red in the spectra taken for the keck pilot program contained essentially no new information for such metal poor stars ,",
    "the hires configuration was slightly shifted to give up the reddest order , thus allowing the inclusion of one more order to the blue .",
    "we thus cover the region from 3805 to 5320 with no gaps to 4910 , and small gaps thereafter to the red as the width of the hires ccd is then smaller than the free spectral range of the echelle",
    ". we will continue with this new configuration until the hires detector is upgraded .",
    "the spectra were exposed such that a minimum snr of 100 per spectral resolution element in the continuum at 4500 was achieved .",
    "this snr calculation utilizes only poisson statistics , ignoring issues of cosmic ray removal , night sky subtraction , flattening , etc .",
    "( the gain setting of the hires ccd detector is 2.4 e@xmath7/adu ; to reach the desired snr of 100 per spectral resolution element requires 1390 adu / pixel . )",
    "the sum of the hires exposures for he  21481247  has 3000 adu / pixel at the center of the echelle order in the continuum near 4500 , corresponding to a signal - to - noise ratio of 145 per spectral resolution element , or 85 per pixel .",
    "this set of hires data was reduced using a combination of figaro scripts and the software package makee .",
    "makee automatically applies heliocentric corrections to each of the individual spectra .",
    "the bias removal , flattening , sky subtraction , object extraction and wavelength solutions with the th - ar arc were performed within makee , after which further processing and analysis was carried out within figaro , where the individual spectra were summed .",
    "the continuum fitting to the sum of the individual spectra ( already approximately corrected via the mean signal level in the flat field spectrum ) uses a 4th - order polynomial to line - free regions of the spectrum in each order .",
    "the degree of the polynomial was reduced in orders with h and k of ca  ii or balmer lines where the fraction of the order available to define the continuum decreased significantly .",
    "a scheme of using adjacent orders to help define the polynomial under such conditions is included in the codes .",
    "the suite of routines for analyzing echlle spectra was written by @xcite within the figaro image processing package @xcite .",
    "the search for absorption features present in our hires data and the measurement of their equivalent width ( @xmath8 ) was done automatically with a fortran code , ewdet , developed for a globular cluster project .",
    "details of this code and its features are given in @xcite .",
    "except in regions affected by ch , cn ( or rarely ) c@xmath9 bands , the determination of the continuum level in these very metal poor stars was easy , and the equivalent widths measured automatically should be quite reliable .",
    "except in regions affected by molecular bands , the crowding of lines is minimal",
    ". hence we initially use automatic gaussian fits for @xmath8 .    the list of lines identified and measured by ewdet",
    "is then correlated , taking the radial velocity into account , to the template list of suitable unblended lines with atomic parameters described in  [ at_data ] to specifically identify the various atomic lines . selected wavelength regions ( i.e. those strongly affected by molecular bands , where no individual line identification can be regarded as secure or the line as unblended ) can be blanked out in this process .",
    "at this point we saw the first hint of the extreme peculiarity of he  21481247 , as strong ba  ii , la  ii , eu  ii , and nd  ii features turned up in the list of automatically identified lines .",
    "selected regions in the spectrum of he  21481247   illustrating some of them are shown in figure  [ figure_spec ] . by comparison ,",
    "he  23442800 , analyzed in @xcite and @xcite , is a `` normal '' very metal poor main sequence turnoff star from the he s with about the same @xmath10 , log(@xmath11 )  and [ fe / h ] as he  21481247 ; it does not show any of the peculiarities of he  21481247  to be discussed below .",
    "the same spectral regions shown in figure  [ figure_spec ] were extracted from the spectrum of he  23442800  and are displayed in figure  [ figure_compstar ] as a comparison .",
    "the automatic identifications were accepted as valid for lines with @xmath8  @xmath12 m .",
    "they were checked by hand for all lines with smaller @xmath8 . the identifications for all the rare earths in the spectrum of he  21481247",
    "were checked by hand .",
    "the resulting @xmath8  for 159 lines in the spectrum of he  21481247  are listed in table  [ table_eqwidth ] .",
    "we attempt to assemble a complete list of the unblended atomic features in this spectral region that might be seen among our entire set of spectra .",
    "we begin with the line list of carretta _ et al . _  ( 2002 ) , created to support our earlier papers on abundances in extremely metal poor stars . with the exceptions noted below ,",
    "we adopt their @xmath13 values when available .",
    "a few blended lines were deleted from their line list .",
    "we then add the unblended lines in the additional bluest hires order .",
    "the transition probabilities for these were taken from the nist atomic spectra database version 2.0 ( nist standard reference database # 78 ) , see @xcite . in the appendix to carretta _",
    "et al . _  ( 2002 ) we give a comparison of our adopted transition probabilities for our initial work with those of nist .",
    "very good agreement was noted for all ions except mg  i , ti  ii , and fe  ii , where larger dispersions occurred .",
    "the additional lines resulting from the extra blue hires order included here do not contain any lines from these three ions .",
    "we adopted the @xmath13 values of @xcite for sc  ii ( which agree with those of nist ) , as well as those of @xcite for pb  i.    since we already have more than 30 spectra of very metal poor stars covering a range of metallicity with [ fe / h ] @xmath14 dex is given by @xmath15 on a scale where @xmath16 h atoms .",
    "then [ x / h ] = log@xmath17[n(x)/n(h ) ] @xmath18 log@xmath17[n(x)/n(h ) ] , and similarly for [ x / fe ] . ] taken with the same instrumental configuration , we also searched for the strongest clean lines in this spectral region of several ions missing from our earlier papers , which we might hope to detect .",
    "lines of ni  i and co  i were picked up in this way in the spectrum of he  21481247  and added , again with @xmath13 values from nist .",
    "we then added into the template line list the strongest expected lines of the rare earths using the line list and @xmath13-values from @xcite .",
    "this produced a template list of 259 lines , 182 of which arise from species through atomic number 28 ( ni ) , with 15 lines from sr , y or zr , 3 from ba , and the remainder from the singly ionized rare earths with the strongest expected lines ( la , ce , pr , nd , sm , eu , gd and dy ) .",
    "values of the collisional broadening parameter @xmath19 for van der waals broadening are available from detailed fits to solar line profiles for the al  i doublet at 3950    from @xcite , for three of the five mg  i lines of interest from @xcite , and for the 4554  ba  ii line ( one of the three lines of interest of this ion ) from @xcite ( chosen in preference to the even larger value of @xmath19 given for this line in * ? ? ?",
    "when such are available , these values are adopted .",
    "damping constants for the remaining lines of the species mg  i , al  i , si  i , ca  i , sr  ii and ba  ii which might be strong enough for collisional broadening to be important are taken from the recent compilation of collisional damping parameters calculated from theory by @xcite .",
    "the damping constants for all fe  i and fe  ii lines were set to twice that of the unsld approximation for van der waals broadening following @xcite .",
    "the damping constant @xmath19 is set to twice that of the unsld approximation for van der waals broadening for all other lines , none of which are strong enough to be affected by the choice of @xmath19 .",
    "note that the above prescription is applied to all spectral lines irrespective of the value of their measured equivalent width .",
    "many of the ions considered here have lines which show appreciable hyperfine structure .",
    "in some cases , the additional complication of multiple stable isotopes is also present .",
    "we adopt the hfs patterns of @xcite for ba  ii .",
    "these are calculated with the solar @xmath3-process isotope distribution .",
    "we also calculated the ba  ii hfs patterns from the @xmath3-process patterns using the isotopic distributions given by @xcite .",
    "we use the hfs and atomic constants of @xcite for la  ii and of @xcite for eu  ii .",
    "we assumed equal abundances for the two stable isotopes of eu , @xmath20eu and @xmath21eu , which is ( approximately ) the solar value and that characteristic of the @xmath3-process , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we calculate the hfs patterns for the relevant co  i lines from data in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the hfs patterns for the relevant mn lines were calculated from the data in @xcite .",
    "there are four lines of sc  ii on the template list . for one of these ,",
    "the hfs pattern was available from @xcite .",
    "for the other three , we calculated the hfs patterns using constants from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for the single v  i line in the template list ( the only clean strong line of v in the blue spectral region ) , which is not detected in he  21481247 , we could only locate hfs parameters for the lower level @xcite .",
    "we adopted parameters for the upper level comparable to the smallest splitting found by @xcite for any of the levels of v  i they studied to calculate the hfs pattern for this line .",
    "a number of major advances in abundance analyses have occurred over the past decade , reflecting progress in atomic physics and computing power .",
    "it is now possible to calculate non - lte corrections more accurately using more realistic model atoms .",
    "furthermore , realistic three dimensional radiative - hydrodynamical convection simulations have begun to become available @xcite and to be applied to abundance determinations in a small number of key situations . @xcite and @xcite discuss the case of c and of o in the sun .",
    "we assume the solar abundances of @xcite , as updated in @xcite . those of @xcite have been derived using classical 1d abundance analyses of carefully selected photospheric lines , with many elements determined from meteoritic values relative to si .",
    "@xcite provides updates for the solar abundances of several key elements including not only small non - lte corrections ( his maximum @xmath22 is 0.045 dex ) but also `` granulation '' corrections resulting from the inadequacies of a classical 1d model given the reality of convection .",
    "his maximum @xmath23 is 0.070 dex , for nitrogen , where the very high excitation of the n  i lines used in the solar analysis produces high sensitivity to fluctuations in temperature .",
    "non - lte corrections appropriate for low metallicity stars are provided in table  [ table_abund ] when available , but we retain the 1d model atmosphere limitation .",
    "thus , for example , the solar n abundance adopted here includes the @xmath24 dex granulation correction , but we do not apply it to the n abundance in he  21481247 , obtained from a cn band .",
    "we assume that the absolute scale of the adopted set of @xmath13 values is correct over the range of line strength from the lines we use here for very metal poor stars with high @xmath13 values to the much weaker lines normally used to determine solar abundances .",
    "@xcite have checked this for a set of lines used to analyze stars in the galactic globular cluster m5 , which at [ fe / h ] @xmath25 dex is significantly more metal rich than the stars considered here .",
    "they successfully reproduced the standard solar abundance for the atomic species in common with the present work to within @xmath260.10 dex with the exception of ca  i , which had a discrepancy of 0.16 dex .    as we use the @xmath13-values and the hyperfine structure constants of @xcite for la  ii , we use their solar la abundance as well , which is slightly different from that given by either of the major compilations cited above .",
    "the @xcite deduced solar eu abundance is in good agreement with that of @xcite .",
    "the same situation holds for pb  i , where the new @xmath13 values of @xcite produce a small shift in the @xcite solar abundance .",
    "the adopted solar abundances are included in the last column of table  [ table_abund ] .",
    "after the first spectra revealed the peculiar nature of he  21481247 , we began a radial velocity monitoring program , attempting to observe the star on each of our subsequent keck / hires runs .",
    "the wavelength scale of our spectra are set by observations of a th - ar arc at least twice per night , together with appropriate heliocentric corrections .",
    "the radial velocity measurement scheme developed for very metal poor stars in the he s relies upon a set of accurate laboratory wavelengths for very strong isolated features within the wavelength range of the hires spectra .",
    "the wavelengths were taken from the nist atomic spectra database version 2.0 ( nist standard reference database # 78 ) . using an approximate initial @xmath27 , the list of automatically detected lines , restricted to the strongest detected lines only , generated in the course of measuring the equivalent widths of the lines ( see  [ equiv_widths ] ) in the spectrum of he",
    "21481247was then searched for each of these features .",
    "a @xmath27 for each line was determined from the central wavelength of the best - fit gaussian , and the average of these , with a 2.5@xmath28 clipping reject cycle , defined the @xmath27 for the star .",
    "very metal poor stars which have been observed repeatedly by george preston ( see preston & sneden 2001 ) are used as radial velocity standards .",
    "the observations of these stars are treated identically as the sample stars ; they serve to monitor the accuracy of the analysis .",
    "since we are interested in small velocity changes , we have taken several steps to increase the accuracy of these measurements .",
    "the two laboratory lines between 4270 and 4330   are omitted if the star shows strong ch .",
    "we have also used the spectra of five bright metal poor stars without strong ch to determine the small mean offsets between the @xmath27 measured from each of the laboratory lines .",
    "we set the absolute scale defining the lab wavelengths of the two unblended lines of the mg triplet as 5172.684 and 5183.604 . with that definition ,",
    "the offsets range from + 4.3 to -2.7 km  s@xmath29 , with only 6 of them exceeding + 1 km  s@xmath29  or less than @xmath30 km  s@xmath29 .",
    "such differences might arise from small errors in the laboratory wavelength or repeatable local errors in the arc fitting procedures . with these modifications , we are able to achieve a 1@xmath28 rms error for the mean @xmath27 of a bright star of 0.15 km  s@xmath29 , and of @xmath31 km  s@xmath29  for all but the faintest of the he s stars for spectra of the quality described in  [ section_obs ] .",
    "table  [ table_vr ] lists the results to date for the two stars from the he s that we are currently monitoring , as well as for hd  186478 , a c - enhanced metal - poor giant star @xcite .",
    "( this is one of the stars suggested by g. preston as a radial velocity standard . ) in addition to he  21481247 , we are monitoring he  0007@xmath181832 , as when first observed with hires in sep .",
    "2001 , it showed slightly resolved spectral lines .",
    "this star has weaker absorption features than does he  21481247 .",
    "the errors in the table are the 1@xmath28 rms error in the mean velocity , computed assuming gaussian statistics from the observed dispersion about the mean and the number of lab lines matched . with hires at keck ,",
    "one pixel is 2.0 km  s@xmath29 , and a spectral resolution element is @xmath03 pixels , so a 4 km  s@xmath29  change in @xmath27 is equivalent to a 2 pixel shift in the line center location for each line .    from the data available thus far ( three hires runs at roughly 6 month intervals over a year ) , we find that he  0007@xmath181832 shows no sign of radial velocity changes .",
    "there is some indication that hd  186478 may have a variable radial velocity rms about the mean of 0.69 km  s@xmath29 . ] , while the radial velocity of he  21481247  is definitely variable and is probably a small amplitude long period binary .",
    "radial velocity monitoring will continue for these three stars .",
    "the procedure used to derive @xmath10  estimates for he  21481247  is fully explained in  4 - 6 of @xcite .",
    "very briefly , @xmath10  is derived from broad - band colors , taking the mean estimates deduced from the de - reddened @xmath32 and @xmath33 colors , where the infrared colors are from 2mass @xcite .",
    "measurements on both the 1.5 m telescope at palomar mountain and on the swope telescope at the las campanas observatory yield @xmath34 , @xmath35 mag for he  21481247 .",
    "we used the grid of predicted broad - band colors and bolometric corrections of @xcite , based on the marcs stellar atmosphere code @xcite , and corrected the colors for reddening by adoption of the extinction maps of @xcite to find @xmath10  = 6380 k. this constrains he  21481247  to be either close to the main sequence turnoff , or on the horizontal branch .",
    "the latter is ruled out by the broad , pressure broadened balmer lines visible in the keck spectra .",
    "we therefore adopt the main sequence turnoff log(@xmath11 )  of 3.9 dex , which was derived from the 12 gyr , [ fe / h ] = @xmath1 isochrone of @xcite .",
    "there is little sensitivity to the choice of [ fe / h ] at this @xmath10 ; if the isochrone for [ fe / h ] = @xmath36 is used instead , then the derived log(@xmath11 )  becomes 4.0 dex .",
    "the resulting stellar parameters are @xmath10=6380 k , log(@xmath11)=3.9 dex and we assumed [ fe / h]=@xmath182.5 dex in this step of our analysis .",
    "we carried out a classical lte analysis using the equivalent widths measured for individual absorption lines .",
    "we employ the grid of stellar atmospheres from @xcite ( with no overshooting ) and a current version of the moog code @xcite . holding @xmath10  and log(@xmath11 )  fixed ,",
    "the final overall metallicities [ m / h ] for he  21481247  were obtained iteratively , by matching observed @xmath8with the synthetic ones computed by integrating the equation of radiative transfer at different wavelengths along each line for the flux . the microturbulent velocity , @xmath37 , of 1.7 @xmath260.2 km  s@xmath29 , was derived by eliminating any trend in derived abundances of fe  i lines with the expected @xmath8   ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the final abundances are given in table  [ table_abund ] .",
    "they were derived by interpolating to the desired @xmath10  and log(@xmath11 )  of he  21481247from the four nearest model atmospheres in the grid with [ fe / h]=@xmath182.5 dex .    as described above in  [ equiv_widths ] ,",
    "our line list was created automatically ( for lines with @xmath8  @xmath38 m ) from the template list of unblended lines .",
    "subsequently we examined the residuals from the mean abundance for lines of each element .",
    "those lines that gave very discrepant results were checked by hand , and were eliminated if they appeared blended or there was some other problem .",
    "a relatively small number of lines were eliminated in this way .",
    "we detected two states of ionization for both fe and ti and compare the abundances of the neutral and singly ionized species in each case .",
    "since there are a large number of detected fe  i lines in principle we ignore any fe  i line with @xmath8@xmath39 m . however , in fact , there are no fe  i lines in the spectrum of he  21481247  in this wavelength range which are that strong ( see table  [ table_eqwidth ] ) .",
    "the comparison is excellent in both cases , with log[@xmath40(fe  ii ) ]",
    "@xmath18 log[@xmath40(fe  i ) ] = @xmath180.04 dex ( with 10 fe  ii lines detected ) . for ti , where there are only three weak ti  i lines detected , this difference is @xmath180.02 dex .",
    "this is remarkably good agreement .",
    "furthermore , the excitation temperature , which we define here as @xmath10  of the model atmosphere for which the abundance deduced from the set of 58 fe  i lines is independent of @xmath41 , the excitation potential of the lower level , is found to be 6480 k , a value which is in very good agreement with @xmath10  as determined from broad band colors .",
    "this suggests , as does the fe ionization equilibrium found for the sample of extremely metal - poor stars studied by @xcite , that non - lte does not significantly alter the results of a classical abundance analysis such as presented here .",
    "the theoretical situation is somewhat unclear , as the results of recent theoretical analyses @xcite disagree on the amplitude to be expected .",
    "@xcite found that nlte corrections for fe lines are very small in dwarfs of any @xmath10 , and only small corrections ( @xmath42 0.1 dex ) are expected for stars on the red giant branch .",
    "@xcite found that nlte corrections become more important as [ fe / h ] decreases , being about 0.2 dex for stars with [ fe / h]@xmath431.25 dex , and that ionized lines are not significantly affected by nlte .",
    "very recently , @xcite and @xcite have carefully calculated the kinetic equilibrium of fe , and present in @xcite a critique of earlier calculations .",
    "they suggest that non - lte corrections intermediate between the above sets of values are appropriate for fe  i.    @xcite and @xcite calculate non - lte for ba  ii and eu  ii in low metallicity stars ; corrections appropriate for he  21481247for these elements from their work are in the range @xmath44 to @xmath45 dex , while @xcite find small non - lte corrections for mg  i in very metal poor stars .",
    "the 3970    doublet of al  i , the only lines of this species detected in our spectra , is an exception .",
    "the calculated non - lte corrections of @xcite are large , about + 0.6 dex for he  21481247 , while only + 0.05 dex is predicted for the sun .",
    "the validity of these large non - lte corrections for this al  i doublet has been verified by studies of bright field stars using the resonance lines as compared to less affected subordinate lines .    on this basis , we choose to include non - lte corrections only for al  i in the remainder of this paper .",
    "however , the fourth column of table  [ table_abund ] gives the non - lte corrections appropriate to he  21481247  for each species , when available , from the sources cited above .",
    "the prominence of lines of ba and of the rare earths in the spectrum of he  21481247  is illustrated in figure  [ figure_spec ] .",
    "the ba  ii , la  ii and nd  ii lines are stronger than those of the sun , even though this star has a very low [ fe / h ] and is somewhat hotter than the sun , while the eu  ii lines detected are slightly weaker than the corresponding solar lines .",
    "the ba  ii lines are the strongest lines in this spectral region , excluding only h and k of ca  ii and the balmer lines .",
    "ba is a difficult element to analyze , because its lines are so strong that the choice of damping constants and hfs become important .",
    "however , we believe , from the comparisons of independent analyses of slightly more metal rich and slightly cooler globular cluster giants described in @xcite , that our analysis should be correct to within 0.2 dex . use of pure @xmath2-process isotopic distributions in calculating the hfs for the ba  ii lines would decrease the deduced ba abundance in he  21481247  by 0.08 dex .    among the rare earths detected , the abundance of pr is the most uncertain , as all the lines are very weak ( see table  [ table_eqwidth ] ) . for sm ,",
    "the 4318    line is a very solid detection , and is seen in the spectra of he  21481247taken in sep .",
    "2002 for radial velocity monitoring as well .",
    "the same holds for the 4103    line of dy  ii .",
    "all of the gd  ii lines seen are very weak , but are definitely real ; they too are visible in the sep 2002 spectra of this star .",
    "the @xmath46 rms dispersions for the values of log[@xmath47 given in table  [ sens_table ] contain contributions from various sources of uncertainties in the stellar parameters as well as in the atomic data .",
    "the errors in [ x / fe ] are typically somewhat smaller than for log(@xmath40 ) as the contribution from the uncertainties in the stellar parameters is partially cancelled in forming the abundance ratios to fe ; if multiple multiple lines of an ion have been detected , that can also lead to significantly smaller errors .",

    "strongly enhanced c , especially when accompanied by highly enhanced n , does have a significant effect on the ability to detect features from certain elements whose crucial lines fall within the wavelength regime covered by the ch or cn bands .",
    "the pb  i line at 4057   , the th  ii line at 4019    and the blue eu  ii lines fall into this category .",

    "we reject the notion that the abundance peculiarities seen in he  21481247  did not originate from a nuclear process , but instead some type of radiative levitation . some classes of ap stars display enormous enhancements of the rare earths , the most extreme known example of which is hd  101065 , przybylski s star , where the rare earths are more or less uniformly enhanced over their solar abundances by a factor of @xmath60 . radiation pressure , primarily due to absorption lines , can support an atom only in a very stable atmosphere , and the effect is highly dependent on luminosity . among old and metal - poor populations , this is seen only in hot horizontal branch stars ( see behr , cohen & mccarthy 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "the distribution of the resulting abundances is that elements with low true abundances rise and appear enhanced , while those with high initial abundances , particularly those with few absorption lines , sink and are depleted .",

    "radiative levitation is not possible in such stars .",
    "the elemental abundances determined for he  21481247  are critical for understanding the sites for the @xmath2- and @xmath3-processes of nucleosynthesis .",
    "the relevant observational facts for this star with a low value of [ fe / h ]  @xmath61 are : ( 1 ) the abundances of the elements from mg to ni including fe relative to hydrogen are far below the solar values and approximately follow the yield patterns inferred for very massive stars ( vmss ) and some type ii supernovae [ sne ii(@xmath62 ) ] by @xcite ; ( 2 ) in general the abundances of the elements from ba to dy relative to hydrogen are remarkably close to the solar values ; ( 3 ) th may be present in high abundance ; ( 4 ) the elements sm , eu , gd , and dy closely follow the solar @xmath3-pattern ; ( 5 ) the elements ba , la , ce , pr , and nd approximately follow the solar main @xmath2-pattern , demonstrating great @xmath2-process enrichment ; ( 6 ) the ba / eu ratio is @xmath63 times that for the solar @xmath3-pattern ; and ( 7 ) the pb / ba ratio is @xmath63 times that for the solar main @xmath2-pattern .",
    "in addition , c and n are highly enhanced in he  21481247 . figure  [ figure_allelem ] displays the distribution of the abundances for the 27 elements obtained here .",

    "the solid line segments indicate the total solar abundance for the same set of elements . it can be seen that eu and sm are distinctly below the solar curve .",
    "if we assume that he  21481247  was initially formed of metal poor gas with an elemental abundance distribution characteristic of its present [ fe / h ] , then it has large enhancements of c and n and of the heavy elements .",

    "figure  [ figure_eursabund ] is similar to figure  [ figure_rsabund ] , but in this case the @xmath3-process and @xmath2-process solar abundance distributions are normalized to eu .",
    "examination of these two figures demonstrates clearly that he  21481247  shows large contributions from both the @xmath2 and the @xmath3-process .",
    "neither component alone is capable of matching the observed heavy element abundances seen .",
    "we note that the ratio of ba to eu in the solar @xmath3-process , @xmath2-process and total solar inventory ( adopted from * ? ? ?",

    "we have thus attempted to reproduce the abundance pattern seen in he  21481247  with a sum of contributions from the two neutron capture processes .",
    "we find that adding 62% of the total solar @xmath3-process inventory to 83% of the total solar @xmath2-process inventory reproduces the abundances of all the elements observed in he  21481247  over the range of atomic number from 56 to 66 to within the observational errors , as is shown in table  [ table_r_s_sum ] .",
    "thus he  21481247 , which is , as judged by the elements na through zr , very metal poor , has almost the total solar inventory of heavy neutron capture elements .",

    "the second is the magnitude of the contributions .",
    "note that figure  [ figure_rscontrib ] is plotted with a logarithmic scale for both axes .",
    "all the stars shown in the figure are very metal poor , and yet in a few of them , including he  21481247 , we see almost the total solar inventory of both @xmath3 and @xmath2 process elements . on the other hand ,",
    "the `` pure '' @xmath3-process stars do not reach more than 10% of the solar eu abundance , nor more than about 1% at most of the solar ba abundance .",
    "the enhancement of the @xmath3-process elements in he  21481247   as compared to the fe peak elements is very large , comparable to or larger than that of the most enhanced pure @xmath3-process star discovered to date .",

    "the enhancement of c and n is also very large .",
    "furthermore the star appears to be a long period binary .",
    "all scenarios for producing c in low mass stars , whether via the classical dredge up on the agb or whether invoking the path to mixing at the he flash for very metal poor stars recently predicted by @xcite , require that the star be at least as evolved to incur the he flash .",
    "but he  21481247  is a star near the main sequence turnoff , and hence can not have produced any of the anomalies we see by itself .",
    "@xcite discovered that the ch stars are all single line spectroscopic binaries .",
    "their spectral peculiarities , including the presence of strong lines of some of the @xmath2-process elements , have been attributed to mass transfer between the components of a binary system . if a very metal poor star has as its binary companion a more massive star that has already evolved to or through the agb phase , enhancements of c , n and the @xmath2-process elements can be produced ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a binary star model places constraints on the binary separation and period , as the mass transfer must not occur while the primary is on the rgb instead of the agb , and too wide a separation may make the mass transfer inefficient , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite discuss the nucleosynthesis of @xmath2-elements in low metallicity agb stars , and find that even without fe seed nuclei , extensive @xmath2-process production may occur .",
    "since he  21481247  is a binary , the extremely enhanced c and n and s - process elements can be explained following the mass transfer scenario outlined above .",
    "the s - process in very metal - poor stars may produce copious amounts of pb if there is a high neutron to seed ratio @xcite , which is also observed in he  21481247  and in he  00242523 , another example of an @xmath2-process enhanced dwarf star found in the course of the keck pilot project ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the existence of at least two dwarf stars with substantial c , n and @xmath2-process enhancements suggests that even among the very metal poor giant stars showing these phenomena , the probable cause is mass transfer in a binary rather than production via internal nucleosynthesis within the star itself .",

    "the pb enhancement of he  21481247 , with figure  12 of @xcite suggests that some adjustments are required in the model of galactic nucleosynthesis from agb stars .",
    "furthermore , these excesses in he  21481247  must be confined mostly to the stellar surface .",
    "there can not have been much sedimentation or mixing of the additional material into the interior of he  21481247 , otherwise the amount of additional neutron capture material required would become prohibitively large .",
    "figure  [ figure_rscontrib ] suggests that the efficiency for the complex chain of events proposed to explain highly @xmath2-process enhanced very metal poor stars , which includes nucleosynthesis in agb stars , dredge up to the surface of the agb star , and mass transfer across a binary , can be surprisingly efficient ; we have effectively taken a very low metallicity star and given it a substantial fraction of the solar @xmath2-process abundances .",
    "this is a much more effective way of enhancing the abundances for a particular star in a binary system with a suitable mass ratio than is the production and distribution into the ism of a single type ii sn .",

    "we infer that the neutron exposure roughly scales with [ fe / h ] but with some variation producing higher pb but not greatly altering the ba peak .",
    "the origin of the apparent @xmath3-process enhancement in he  21481247  is , however , not known .",
    "such a large @xmath3-process enhancement is very rare .",
    "the enhancement of eu found among the `` pure '' @xmath3-process enhanced stars is much lower ( see figure  [ figure_rscontrib ] ) . in previous studies",
    "it was argued that the high enrichments of @xmath3-process elements in a low - metallicity star must be the result of surface contamination by a binary companion subsequent to the formation of the binary and do not represent the composition of the interstellar medium ( ism ) from which the star was formed @xcite .",
    "hence one possible way to produce both @xmath2 and @xmath3 enhancement is to consider that he  21481247  was the least massive member of a triple system .",
    "it could then have obtained its @xmath3-process material from a massive star in this system which became a type ii sn .",
    "then , assuming the binary did not become unbound by the sn explosion nor the low mass star ablated away , the intermediate mass component of this system , as it passed through the agb phase , could have produced the @xmath2-process material and the excess of c and n , and transferred this material across the binary to he  21481247 .",
    "a triple star system with a history as described above appears to be an implausible scenario .",
    "another possibility is that our understanding of the @xmath2-process yields in agb stars is flawed , and that all of the eu as well as the ba observed in he  21481247was produced through the @xmath2-process .",
    "the range of ba / eu predicted from agb nucleosynthesis in different calculations is fairly broad .",
    "@xcite predict ba / eu  640 , which is slightly smaller than that of @xcite as quoted in @xcite for the solar @xmath2-process inventory , but this is still far larger than the ratio observed in he  21481247 .",
    "however , the predicted ba / eu ratio for the most metal poor case ( and only that particular case ) of agb nucleosynthesis by @xcite of @xmath0105 is much closer to that of he  21481247  than those of most other groups . in either case , the absolute abundances of the heavy elements predicted after dredge up at the surface of a very metal poor agb star are insufficient to explain the observations .",
    "furthermore , as is shown in figure  [ figure_rscontrib ] , very metal poor stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath77 to @xmath78 with enhanced abundances of the heavy neutron capture elements which appear dominated by the @xmath2-process show ba / eu ratios of 300 to 800 , considerably larger than that of he  21481247 .",
    "hence this hypothesis too is rejected .",
    "the theoretical calculations of @xmath2-process production via agb nucleosynthesis , followed by dredge up to the surface of the agb star , then by mass transfer across a binary system are very complex .",
    "as reviewed by @xcite , models of nucleosynthesis in agb stars have advanced greatly over the past few years , particularly at near solar metallicity , although the problem of galactic enrichment over a wide range of metallicity is not adequately addressed .",
    "however , it is clear that changes in agb models to fit such an extreme case as he  21481247  seem to be required .",
    "accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) of a white dwarf in a binary is an interesting possibility to produce the enhancements seen in he  21481247 .",
    "this produces a bare neutron star , which also might satisfy the requirement for the source of the heavy @xmath3-elements .",
    "the aic mechanisms were discussed earlier ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the possibility of aic events being the source of @xmath3-elements was pointed out by @xcite . the case for aic events being a source of the heavy @xmath3-elements will be presented in a companion paper , @xcite . the data on he  21481247  were critical in this inference .",
    "the overall model is that a binary system is initially formed with one star being of mass @xmath79@xmath80 and the other being of @xmath81 .",
    "the more massive star evolves through the agb phase producing @xmath2-elements , some of which are transferred to its lower - mass companion .",
    "depending on the ratio of neutrons to the fe seeds in the agb star , the @xmath2-process may produce an extremely high pb / ba ratio or a pattern similar to the solar main @xmath2-pattern .",
    "the more massive star eventually loses its envelope and becomes a white dwarf , which upon accreting material from the companion , subsequently collapses into a neutron star .",
    "the surface layers of the neutron star are heated by an enormous flux of neutrinos .",
    "this drives a wind , in which the heavy @xmath3-elements are produced .",
    "some of the heavy @xmath3-elements are again transferred to the companion .",
    "we consider this scenario to be a self - consistent explanation for the data on he  21481247  and for the observations of other low - metallicity stars with high enrichments ranging from predominantly @xmath3-process to predominantly @xmath2-process in origin .",
    "further , we note that the binary might be disrupted during the aic event .",
    "this would explain why a number of low - metallicity stars with high @xmath2-process enrichments appear to be single stars @xcite .",
    "th / eu cosmochronology depends critically on the assumption that the initial production ratio of these two elements is constant and is that given by the @xmath3-process . th / eu for he  21481247  is consistent with the expected ( old ) age for very metal poor stars to within the ( large ) uncertainties .",
    "the th / eu values for the bright stars studied by @xcite and for bd+17@xmath68 @xcite are as well .",
    "however , cs  22892 - 052 has an apparent th / eu age of @xmath016 gyr while cs  31082 - 001 has a very young th / eu age @xcite . among the possible causes of this are non - uniformities in the @xmath3-process yields ( see , for example , otsuki , matthews & kajino 2002 ) or an underestimate in the errors in the abundance determinations for the elements th and/or eu in these two stars4 gyr . ] .",
    "the first of the above difficulties , as well as the impact of potential @xmath2-process contributions to the eu abundance such as occurs in he  21481247 , might be decreased considerably by moving from a chronology based on th / eu to one based on th / u , but detection of u is quite difficult .    our analysis of he  21481247  provides good evidence for mixing of @xmath3 and @xmath2-process enhancements , which in turn leads to variation of the relative abundances of the heavy neutron capture elements , in particular ba / eu and hence th / eu , in very metal poor stars .",
    "we are still far from an understanding of the details of the nucleosynthesis sites and production mechanisms for the heavy elements in very metal poor stars , hence the use of eu / th as a chronometer seems fraught with difficulties .    the entire keck / hires user community owes a huge debt to jerry nelson , gerry smith , steve vogt , and many other people who have worked to make the keck telescope and hires a reality and to operate and maintain the keck observatory .",
    "we are grateful to the w. m. keck foundation for the vision to fund the construction of the w. m. keck observatory .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",

    "<S> ba and la are enhanced by a somewhat larger factor and reach the solar abundance , while pb significantly exceeds it , thus demonstrating the addition of substantial @xmath2-process material . </S>",
    "<S> ba / eu is ten times the solar @xmath3-process ratio but much less than that of the @xmath2-process , indicating a substantial @xmath3-process addition as well . c and n are also very highly enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that he  21481247  is a radial velocity variable ; it is probably a small amplitude long period binary . </S>",
    "<S> the c , n and the @xmath2-process element enhancements thus presumably were produced through mass transfer from a former agb binary companion . </S>",
    "<S> the large enhancement of heavy @xmath3-nuclides also requires an additional source as this is far above any inventory in the ism at such low [ fe / h ] . </S>",
    "<S> we consider that the @xmath2-process material was added by mass transfer of a more massive companion during its thermally pulsating agb phase and ending up as a white dwarf . </S>",
    "<S> we further hypothesize that accretion onto the white dwarf from the envelope of the star caused accretion induced collapse of the white dwarf , forming a neutron star , which then produced heavy @xmath3-nuclides and again contaminated its companion . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism in a binary system can thus enhance the envelope of the lower mass star in @xmath2 and @xmath3-process material sequentially . through analysis of the neutron capture element abundances taken from the literature for a large sample of very metal poor stars </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate , as exemplified by he  21481247 , that mass transfer in a suitable binary can be very efficient in enhancing the heavy elements in a star ; it appears to be capable of enhancing the @xmath2-process elements in very metal poor stars to near the solar abundance , but not substantially above it . </S>",
