    "the main result of this paper is theorem [ thm : maindistr ] , which provides an extension of the support theorem of lions and titchmarsch to specific ( but very large ) classes of invariant singular linear partial differential operators with real analytic coefficients and to distributions having a compact support with invariant convex hull .",
    "the invariance considered here is with respect to certain finite groups of orthogonal transformations generated by reflections . in the 2-dimensional case ,",

    "the employ of holmgren s theorem is the reason for imposing to the coefficients of the considered differential operators to be real analytic .",
    "several other authors employed holmgren s uniqueness theorem for proving @xmath2-convexity properties ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "remarkable is nevertheless , that the proof of our theorem is very elementary .",
    "it requires only basic facts from convex geometry and an application of equation ( [ eq : suppconv ] ) .",

    "the solvability of @xmath44-invariant differential operators is one of the fundamental problems in the analysis on a symmetric space @xmath45 ( see @xcite , p. 275 ) .",
    "recall that theorem [ thm : solvable ] holds more generally if @xmath1 is replaced with a 2nd countable smooth manifold ( see @xcite , p. 14 ) .",
    "since @xmath45 is a second countable smooth manifold , one obtains the equivalence between global and semi - global solvability , provided one can prove that @xmath45 is @xmath2-convex .",
    "the solvability of invariant differential operators on riemannian symmetric space was proved by helgason @xcite . in the general pseudo - riemannian symmetric case ,",
    "van den ban and schlichtkrull @xcite determined a sufficient condition for a @xmath44-invariant differential operator @xmath2 ensuring that @xmath45 is @xmath2-convex .",
    "this condition involves the degree of the polynomial which is the image of @xmath2 under the harish - chandra isomorphism .",
    "it is for instance always satisfied when @xmath45 is split , i.e. , has a vectorial cartan subspace .",
    "the riemannian symmetric spaces of the noncompact type are examples of split symmetric spaces and so are the @xmath46 space of oshima and sekiguchi , @xcite .    as a first application of theorem [ thm : maindistr ] , we deduce in section [ section : appl ] the @xmath2-convexity of riemannian symmetric spaces @xmath47 of noncompact type when @xmath2 is a @xmath44-invariant differential operator on @xmath47 .",
    "our method , which is based on taking the radial component of @xmath2 along the cartan subgroup , is different from those of used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "support theorems play also an important role in harmonic analysis , in particular in paley - wiener type theorems .",
    "these theorems characterize the space of functions which are image , under a suitable generalization of the fourier transform , of the compactly supported smooth functions .",
    "applications in this setting appeared first in the work of van den ban and schlichtkrull on fourier transforms on pseudo - riemannian symmetric spaces @xcite .",
    "the basic idea , which we shall outline more precisely in section [ section : appl ] , is to cancel the singularities appearing in a wave packet @xmath4 by applying a suitable differential operator @xmath2 .",
    "the problem is to compare the size of the support of @xmath9 , which can be easily determined , with the hard to determine size of the support of the original wave packet @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , our need for support properties like those stated in the present paper turned up in the proof of a paley - wiener type theorem for the @xmath48-hypergeometric transform , which is a fourier type transform related to the theory of hypergeometric functions associated with root systems . see @xcite . however , we point out that theorem [ thm : maindistr ] is stated in a very general setting and applies to many different situations .",

    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "section : setting ] we introduce the general setting in which our extension of the theorem of lions and titchmarsch will be proved . the main results , theorems [ thm : maindistr ] and [ thm : mainfunction ] , will be stated and proved in section [ section : thmsupport ] .",
    "section [ section : examples ] presents several concrete situations where our support theorem applies .",
    "the presented examples are related to the theory of special functions associated with root systems .",
    "the last section is devoted to applications .",
    "we deduce the @xmath2-convexity of riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type when @xmath2 is an invariant differential operator .",

    "in particular we introduce the class of differential operators that will be considered in this article and give few examples .    in the following @xmath49 stands for an real euclidean vector space of dimension @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath50 .",

    "these integrable systems are described by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath489 with potential energy @xmath490 where the function @xmath264 has five possible forms .",
    "here we consider the cases i , ii and v as listed in @xcite , ( 3.1.14 ) and ( 3.8.3 ) : @xmath491 the calogero hamiltonian of example [ ex : calogero ] is a special instance of case i. the associated schrdinger operators are the linear partial differential operators @xmath492 they are invariant with respect to the weyl group @xmath357 of @xmath359 .",
    "the operator @xmath245 can be regularized by multiplication by the polynomial @xmath416 of ( [ eq : pi ] ) in the cases i and v , and by multiplication by @xmath493 as in ( [ eq : delta ] ) .",
    "the possibility of applying theorems [ thm : maindistr ] and [ thm : mainfunction ] to these regularized differential operators can be proven as in examples [ ex : hyper ] and [ ex : bessel ] .",
    "in fact , there is a close relation between the operator @xmath245 of case ii , resp . of case i , and the operator @xmath144 of ( [ eq : l ] ) , resp . to the operator @xmath145 of ( [ eq : lo ] ) .",
    "see e.g. @xcite , theorem 2.1.1 , and @xcite .",
    "for an overview on the role of the hamiltonian systems treated in this example in different areas of theoretical physics and mathematics , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "in this section we apply theorem [ thm : mainfunction ] to differential operators on symmetric spaces .",
    "in particular we give a new proof of the @xmath2-convexity of the riemannian symmetric space @xmath47 , c.f .",
    "our proof uses theorem [ thm : mainfunction ] , applied to the radial part of invariant differential operators and is , as far as we know , new .",

    "then the set @xmath359 consisting of all @xmath502 for which @xmath503 is a ( generally non - reduced ) root system as defined in section [ section : examples ] .",
    "it is called the _ ( restricted ) root system _ of @xmath504 .",
    "the multiplicity @xmath366 of @xmath365 is defined as the dimension of @xmath505 .",
    "the map @xmath401 given by @xmath506 is a multiplicity function on @xmath359 .",
    "this construction associates with the riemannian symmetric space @xmath47 a triple @xmath507 . as before we denote by @xmath357 the corresponding weyl group .",
    "let @xmath368 be a choice of positive roots and let @xmath508 be the corresponding positive chamber . denote by @xmath509 the exponential map .",
    "then @xmath510 is an abelian subgroup of @xmath44 diffeomorphic to @xmath52 .",
    "we set @xmath511 .",
    "the map @xmath512 is surjective and the @xmath513-component is unique up to conjugation by an element of @xmath357 .",
    "hence every @xmath19-bi - invariant subset of @xmath44 is of the form @xmath514 where @xmath515 is a @xmath357-invariant subset of @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , @xmath515 is compact if and only if @xmath516 is .",
    "let @xmath517 denote the space of compactly supported smooth functions on @xmath47 .",
    "using the map @xmath518 , @xmath519 , we will often identify smooth functions on @xmath47 with the corresponding right @xmath19-invariant function on @xmath44 .",
    "[ lemma : suppfkak ] let @xmath521 and suppose that @xmath282 is @xmath19-bi - invariant .",

    "moreover , @xmath524 is a @xmath357-invariant compact subset of @xmath513 .",
    "denote by @xmath525 the ( commutative ) algebra of @xmath44-invariant differential operators on @xmath47 .",
    "we identify @xmath407 can be identified with the submanifold @xmath526 .",
    "then , for every @xmath527 , there is a unique @xmath357-invariant differential operator , @xmath528 on @xmath407 , called the _ radial part of @xmath2 _ , so that for all @xmath529 one has @xmath530 see @xcite , p. 259 .",
    "define a differential operator on @xmath52 , also denoted by @xmath531 , by @xmath532 in this way , we can consider @xmath528 as a ( singular ) @xmath357-invariant differential operator on the euclidean space @xmath52 . to simplify our notation ,",
    "we shall adopt the identification @xmath533 using the exponential map .",
    "then @xmath534 .",
    "we then write @xmath535 instead of @xmath523 , and the above mentioned decomposition of a @xmath19-bi - invariant subset of @xmath44 will be written as @xmath536 instead of @xmath537 . with these identifications ,",
    "the operator @xmath528 turns out to be a hypergeometric differential operator associated with the triple @xmath538 as considered in subsection [ ex : hyper ] .",
    "when @xmath539 is @xmath19-invariant , we can moreover extend ( [ eq : radialpart ] ) by @xmath357-invariance to obtain @xmath540    [ lemma : almostdconvex ] let @xmath47 be a riemannian symmetric space of the noncompact type .",
    "let @xmath527 and let @xmath515 be a compact , convex and @xmath357-invariant subset of @xmath52 .",
    "set @xmath541 .",
    "then for all @xmath521 , we have @xmath542    we need to prove that @xmath543 implies @xmath544 .",
    "the first step is , as in @xcite , to reduce to the case in which the support of @xmath4 is left-@xmath19-invariant .",
    "the function @xmath4 can in fact be expanded as a sum of @xmath19-finite functions . since @xmath545 is left-@xmath19-invariant",
    ", we will obtain @xmath544 if the support of each @xmath19-finite summand is contained in @xmath545 .",
    "we can therefore assume that @xmath4 , and hence @xmath9 , are @xmath19-finite .",
    "as the support of a @xmath19-finite function is left @xmath19-invariant , we obtain from lemma [ lemma : suppfkak ] that @xmath546 and @xmath547 where @xmath548 and @xmath549 are @xmath357-invariant and compact .",
    "since @xmath543 , we then conclude that @xmath550 . since @xmath528 is a hypergeometric differential operator , corollary [ cor : mainhypw ] with @xmath551 yields that @xmath552 .",
    "this proves the required inclusion .",
    "[ thm : dconvex ] let @xmath47 and @xmath527 be as in lemma [ lemma : almostdconvex ] .",

    "here @xmath24 denotes the formal transpose of @xmath2 .",
    "choose @xmath557 so that @xmath558 the set @xmath559 is @xmath19-bi - invariant , hence @xmath560 for some @xmath357-invariant compact subset @xmath515 of @xmath561 .",
    "since @xmath562 we can apply lemma [ lemma : suppfkak ] to it .",
    "so @xmath563 . we can then select @xmath564 .",
    "we conclude this section by a short discussion of the application of the theorem of our support theorem in harmonic analysis corresponding the the @xmath48-hypergeometric transform , c.f .",
    "because of the technical nature of this application , a detailed exposition would require a certain amount of notation and of background information .",
    "instead , we prefer here just to outline the main ideas involved .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite for further information .",
    "as already remarked in the introduction , the support theorem plays a role in the study of the _ paley - wiener space_. this is the set of images under a suitable generalization @xmath565 of the fourier transform , of the compactly supported smooth functions .",
    "the paley - wiener space generally consists of entire or meromorphic functions with exponential growth and possibly satisfying additional symmetry conditions .",
    "the size the support of the original function is linked to the exponential growth of its fourier transform .",
    "the thrust of paley - wiener type theorems is usually to prove that , if a function @xmath453 in the paley - wiener space has a given exponential growth , then the support of the associated `` wave packet '' @xmath566 ( obtained by formal application to @xmath453 of the inverse fourier transform @xmath567 of @xmath565 ) is compact and has the correct size . in the classical situation of the fourier",
    "transform on @xmath1 , this is proven by a suitable `` shift '' of contour of integration by means of cauchy s theorem .",
    "the shift is allowed because @xmath566 is given by integration of an entire function of exponential type and rapidly decreasing .",
    "a suitable generalization of this argument was applied also to the spherical fourier transform on riemannian symmetric spaces .",
    "see @xcite , ch .",
    "iv ,  7.2 , or @xcite ,  6.6 . for pseudo - riemannian symmetric spaces",
    "the situation is more complicated . here",
    "the wave packages are integrals of meromorphic functions and the required shift of integration would generally require addition of certain `` residues '' . for some kinds of fourier transforms , like the spherical fourier - laplace transform on noncompactly causal symmetric spaces with even multiplicities @xcite ,",
    "the singularities of the integrand are cancelled by multiplication by a certain polynomial function @xmath429 .",
    "hence , for every function @xmath453 in the paley - wiener space the wave - packet @xmath568 is given by integration of an entire function .",
    "furthermore , there is an invariant differential operator @xmath2 so that @xmath569 .",
    "the possibility of shifting the contour of integration in @xmath568 allows us then to determine the size of the support of @xmath570 .",
    "the generalization of the support theorem of lions and titchmarsch presented in this papers allows us finally to recover the size of the support of @xmath571 .",
    "a concrete application of this procedure using theorem [ thm : mainfunction ] can be found in @xcite in the context of the @xmath48-hypergeometric transform .",
    "the latter transform , stated in a setting of transforms associated with root systems , is a common generalization of opdam s hypergeometrical transform ( hence of harish - chandra s spherical transform on riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type ) and of the fourier - laplace transform on noncompactly causal symmetric spaces @xcite .",
    "a similar application would also be needed for determining the paley - wiener space for the transform associated with the @xmath48-bessel functions of @xcite .",
