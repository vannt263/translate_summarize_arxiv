    "the force - induced translocation through a pore in the membrane is mainly motivated by the possibility for fast dna and rna sequencing @xcite .",
    "translocation dynamics is an essential component of transport in biological cells @xcite .",
    "most of the experimental studies so far deal with a driven polymer translocation which is realized by applying an electrical field across a narrow pore @xcite .",
    "however , despite extensive research , numerous computer experiments , and a variety of attempts for theoretical interpretations , the translocation dynamics even in the generic case remains at present insufficiently well understood @xcite . as emphasized in a recent review paper @xcite , currently there exists a plethora of theoretical predictions for the value of the translocation exponent @xmath10 which governs the scaling of the mean translocation time @xmath12 with the length @xmath6 of the polymer chain ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "these values vary in a rather broad interval : one predicts @xmath14 @xcite , or @xmath15 @xcite for a three - dimensional ( @xmath16 ) self - avoiding ( saw ) polymer chain ( where the flory exponent @xmath17 and the surface exponent @xmath18 ) , up to @xmath19 @xcite and @xmath20 @xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite we demonstrated that the dynamics of a single polymer moving through a nanopore in a membrane ( i.e. the translocation dynamics ) with or without an external force being present can be treated within the framework of fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) .",
    "it was shown that the corresponding fokker - planck equation of motion ( fpem ) contains time - dependent drift and diffusion terms . in the case of non - driven chain",
    "this fpem leads naturally to anomalous diffusion of the translocation coordinate @xmath21 @xcite that describes the number of segments threaded through the pore at time @xmath22 .",
    "on the other hand , for a driven translocation fluctuations play a relatively moderate role and one can directly construct reasonable scaling relations that describe the process .",
    "recently , an interesting approach based on the notion of tensile force propagation along the chain ( within the well known picture of tensile blobs@xcite ) has been suggested by t. sakaue @xcite in an effort to provide a consistent description of translocation dynamics .",
    "approach appears physically sound and well capable of providing a plausible interpretation of existing observation .",
    "however , his mathematical treatment requires the use of a `` cut - off '' trick as applied to the polymer segments density function ( see more details in the appendix [ app ] ) . this trick is questionable and affects the predicted translocation exponent @xmath10 .    in the present paper",
    "we follow sakaue s approach and consider theoretically the case of a driven translocation by means of a different derivation which does not require additional conjectures . in sec .",
    "ii we investigate the various regimes ( named traditionally a `` trumpet '' , `` stem - trumpet '' , and `` stem '' regimes ) , observed for weak , intermediate and strong driving forces .",
    "our consideration is based on equating the driving and drag forces , i.e. , on a _ quasi - static approximation _ whereby fluctuations in this balance of forces are ignored .",
    "our main concern is the scaling law for the mean translocation time @xmath12 with respect to the chain length @xmath6 and the applied driving force @xmath8 .",
    "we find @xmath23 albeit with a different expression for @xmath10 as well as the mean translocated length @xmath24 vs. time .",
    "we also perform extensive molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations in order to test our theoretical predictions . in sec .",
    "iii we describe the simulation model and compare theoretical predictions with simulation data .",
    "this comparison shows that the exponent @xmath10 , found in md - simulation , is systematically smaller then its theoretical estimate even though @xmath10 changes with @xmath8 as expected .",
    "we argue that this may be due to fluctuations which are neglected in the theoretical treatment .",
    "finally , in the appendix [ app ] we explain in detail why the calculations of sakaue @xcite are bound to produce a scaling exponent that differs from the proper one .",
    "we assume that the pulling force is applied only to a bead which is inside the pore , i.e. , the potential drops mainly across the pore .",
    "this assumption was recently examined for charged dna translocations @xcite .",
    "it was shown , in particular , that the ionic current generates a nonuniform electric field which is extended far beyond the pore and acts on both the dna and its counter ions . in this case",
    "the dna threading through the pore is preceded by its capture by electroosmotic flow . on the other hand",
    ", it can be shown that for a sufficiently narrow pore the voltage drop mainly takes place inside the pore @xcite .",
    "in this situation the translocation is mainly determined by the threading process which is the main subject of our investigation .    when a pulling force is suddenly switched on , tension starts to propagate along the chain backbone which alters the polymer conformation progressively .",
    "eventually , after some characteristic time a steady state is reached and the whole polymer starts moving with constant velocity .",
    "such a non - equilibrium response is of great importance in many biological and technological situations .",

    "one may readily see that the differential representation of the material conservation , eq.([false ] ) , suffers from the problem that the linear density @xmath340^{1/\\nu - 1}/a\\right|_{x =- x(t)}$ ] does not exist because it diverges !",
    "indeed , it is evident from eq .",
    "( [ solution_blob_1 ] ) that @xmath37 at @xmath107 has an integrable singularity .",
    "the physical reason for such behavior is clear : the force at the free boundary is zero , therefore , the tensile blob size goes to infinity ( cf .",
    "( [ zero ] ) .",
    "because of this , one should use from the very beginning the integral form eq .",
    "( [ material_balance ] ) and may turn to the differential equation for @xmath0 ( cf .",

    "( [ tau_1 ] ) . in the case of rouse dynamics ( @xmath351 ) , the scaling law eq .",

    "despite the fact that this value for the @xmath10-exponent correlates better with our md - findings , one may doubt if the calculation based on the `` cut - off '' trick is trustworthy .",
    "actually , this `` cut - off '' trick makes the `` trumpet '' effectively shorter so that sakaue s characteristic time @xmath354 is smaller than ours @xmath355 .",

    "<S> we suggest a theoretical description of the force - induced translocation dynamics of a polymer chain through a nanopore . </S>",
    "<S> our consideration is based on the tensile ( pincus ) blob picture of a pulled chain and the notion of propagating front of tensile force along the chain backbone , suggested recently by t.  sakaue . </S>",
    "<S> the driving force is associated with a chemical potential gradient that acts on each chain segment inside the pore . </S>",
    "<S> depending on its strength , different regimes of polymer motion ( named after the typical chain conformation , `` trumpet '' , `` stem - trumpet '' , etc . ) occur . assuming that the local driving and drag forces are equal ( i.e. , in a quasi - static approximation ) </S>",
    "<S> , we derive an equation of motion for the tensile front position @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the scaling law for the average translocation time @xmath1 changes from @xmath2 to @xmath3 ( for the free - draining case ) as the dimensionless force @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the kuhn segment length , the chain length , the flory exponent , the driving force , and the temperature , respectively ) increases . these and other predictions are tested by molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation . </S>",
    "<S> data from our computer experiment indicates indeed that the translocation scaling exponent @xmath10 grows with the pulling force @xmath11 ) albeit the observed exponent @xmath10 stays systematically smaller than the theoretically predicted value . </S>",
    "<S> this might be associated with fluctuations which are neglected in the quasi - static approximation . </S>"
