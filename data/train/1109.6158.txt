    "in order to understand the mechanisms for color confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in qcd , one probably needs a non - perturbative method .",
    "a hint for this may be the hidden local symmetry  @xcite ; the properties of the @xmath0 meson are well described as the gauge boson of a spontaneously broken gauge symmetry .",
    "it is suggesting that there is some dual picture of qcd in which the @xmath0 meson comes out as a gauge field .",
    "one of such examples is the holographic qcd  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 meson in this case is identified as the lowest kaluza - klein mode of a gauge field which propagates into the extra - dimension in the gravity picture . in order to fully connect to the real 4d qcd",
    ", one needs to decouple all the artificially added modes . if one can do this decoupling smoothly , _",
    "i.e. , _ without a phase transition , qualitative understanding of the low energy qcd can be obtained within the perturbation theory in the dual picture .",
    "another example , which is more relevant to this work , is the use of the electric - magnetic dualities in supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "seiberg and witten  @xcite have shown that @xmath1 supersymmetric @xmath2 gauge theory provides an explicit example of confinement by the monopole condensation  @xcite .",
    "along this line , relations between flavor symmetry breaking and confinement have been studied .",
    "it has been observed that there are examples in which flavor symmetry is spontaneously broken by condensations of magnetic degrees of freedom  @xcite , and thus the same condensations explain both confinement and flavor symmetry breaking . in the case of @xmath3 supersymmetric qcd ( sqcd )",
    ", the seiberg duality  @xcite is believed to be the electric - magnetic duality .",
    "the dual magnetic theory contains dual quarks , which transform under both the dual gauge group and the flavor group .",
    "the condensation of the dual quarks causes the color - flavor locking in the dual picture , and again relates confinement and flavor symmetry breaking .",
    "this phenomenon has been demonstrated in a model with a @xmath4 gauge group  @xcite .",
    "recently , komargodski discussed the identification of massive magnetic gauge bosons in the seiberg dual picture as the vector mesons with emphasis on the similarity to the hidden local symmetry and the realization of the vector meson dominance  @xcite .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite for an early work on this interpretation .",
    "the examples studied in supersymmetric theories are very suggestive that real qcd may have a similar picture for confinement and chiral symmetry breaking . however , there are difficulties in connecting non - perturbative results in supersymmetric theories to real qcd .",
    "first of all , real qcd has no supersymmetry .",
    "even with supersymmetry , @xmath5 gauge theories with two or three flavors are out of the region where the seiberg duality exists .",
    "it is also not easy to have chiral symmetry which is an essential feature in qcd .",
    "if we start with @xmath6 supersymmetric theory with @xmath5 gauge group , chiral symmetry is explicitly broken from the first place .",
    "one can start with @xmath3 theories but no explicit example with exact chiral symmetry and its breaking to their diagonal subgroup has been found in refs .",

    "studied sqcd models with small soft supersymmetry breaking terms  @xcite .",
    "these models reduce to qcd when the soft terms are large .",
    "many interesting results are obtained by using the exact results of sqcd  @xcite . for example , in @xmath7 gauge theory with @xmath8 massless flavors and for @xmath9 , spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking by the meson condensation can be seen as a result of balancing between the non - perturbatively generated superpotential and the soft masses .",
    "this vacua has been further studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the different scaling behavior from qcd expectations in the large @xmath10 limit has been reported .",

    "@xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 , as well as the @xmath14 baryon symmetry . the seiberg dual theory is an @xmath15 gauge theory and contains dual quarks which transform under both the gauge group and the flavor group ; this part has the same structure as the hidden local symmetry . by including supersymmetry breaking terms",
    ", we find a vacuum where the condensations of the dual quarks break chiral symmetry down to the vectorial @xmath16 symmetry while preserving @xmath14 symmetry as in real qcd .",
    "the higgsing of the dual magnetic gauge theory expels the magnetic flux ( that is the color flux in the electric picture ) from the vacuum , and thus two phenomena in qcd : confinement and chiral symmetry breaking , are connected .",
    "the model reduces to qcd when we take a limit of large masses of the auxiliary flavors and large soft supersymmetry breaking terms .",
    "we argue that there is a good chance that the vacuum we find is continuously connected to the qcd vacuum since they are pretty similar .",
    "the vacuum is different from the one discovered in ref .  @xcite . adding extra flavors is essential for our vacuum to exist .",
    "the non - perturbatively generated superpotential is not necessary for stabilizing the vacuum at non - zero vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "therefore , there is no problem in the large @xmath10 scalings .",
    "we start with the review of the hidden local symmetry and comment on the vector meson dominance in linearized models .",
    "we find that the vector meson dominance can not be realized in sqcd models at tree level when the symmetry breaking pattern is @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath17 @xmath16 , that has not been studied in ref .",
    "we present an explicit model to realize hidden local symmetry in section  [ sec : model ] and study the vacuum .",
    "the case with @xmath18 and @xmath19 is studied in section  [ sec : qcd ] where we propose a new interpretation of the light mesons .",
    "an application to electroweak symmetry breaking is discussed in section  [ sec : ewsb ] .",
    "we start with the discussion of the hidden local symmetry and its connection to the vector meson dominance .",

    "the massive gauge boson describes the @xmath0 meson .",
    "this lagrangian gives phenomenologically successful nontrivial relations among physical quantities , @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 these relations are quite successful with @xmath40 the fact that @xmath41 vanishes for @xmath42 is called the vector meson dominance and realized in qcd . fig .  [ fig : hls ] demonstrates how successful the model is .",
    "the hidden local symmetry is a non - linear sigma model due to the constraint that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are unitary matrices . the model can easily be uv completed by embedding @xmath22 and @xmath23 into some linearly transforming higgs fields .",
    "for example , @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be embedded into @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the lagrangian ( the kinetic terms for the higgs fields ) reduces to the hidden local symmetry with @xmath46 at tree level .",
    "when one obtains the hidden local symmetry from deconstruction of the extra dimensional gauge theory , this value is realized at the three - site level  @xcite , and becomes @xmath47 in the continuum limit  @xcite .",
    "another example is to include @xmath48 in addition to the above model , and embed @xmath49 to @xmath50 .",
    "this reduces to a model with @xmath51 .",
    "the correct sign for the kinetic term of @xmath50 indicates that @xmath52 is not possible at tree level as one can see in eq .  .",
    "when we identify @xmath20 as the magnetic gauge theory of sqcd , the seiberg duality says that the particle content is @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath50 as the dual quarks and the meson .",
    "therefore , one can not obtain @xmath52 in the dual picture of the sqcd at tree level . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is argued that @xmath55 is realized in sqcd .",
    "however , the examples used there is not the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "although it sounds unfortunate that the phenomenologically favorable value , @xmath56 , can not be realized in sqcd , we do not argue that the approach from sqcd is unsuccessful .",
    "it is important to note that the value @xmath42 is not stable under the renormalization . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was found that the @xmath43 parameter has a uv fixed point at @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , having @xmath57 at tree level may not be so bad .",
    "we present a model to study qcd by adding massive modes as regulators .",
    "although it is not guaranteed that the study of such models have something to do with the real qcd , it provides us with qualitative understanding of it if it is smoothly connected to the vacuum of real qcd .",
    "we present a model which possesses a sufficiently similar vacuum to the real qcd one .",
    "our goal is to study a non - supersymmetric @xmath7 gauge theory with @xmath8 massless quarks .",
    "we here add various massive modes to make it possible to use the seiberg duality .",
    "the starting point is an @xmath3 supersymmetric @xmath7 gauge theory with @xmath58 chiral superfields in the fundamental representation .",

    "@xcite .    as another possibility",
    ", @xmath68 looks minimizing the potential at tree level . because the rank of @xmath69 is smaller than @xmath10 , there is not a stable supersymmetric vacuum in this direction , but there can be a local minimum as in the model of ref .",
    "the possibility of such a local minimum has been studied in the presence of massless flavors and found that there is not  @xcite . however , adding supersymmetry breaking terms may create a vacuum . in this case , the dual gauge boson obtains a mass by the @xmath70 condensation without breaking the @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 chiral symmetry . the structure of the hidden local symmetry can not be seen in this vacuum .",
    "we need to look for other vacua to realize the hidden local symmetry .",
    "a good candidate can easily be found by looking at the quantum numbers in table  [ tab : mag ] .",
    "it is the @xmath71 direction that breaks chiral symmetry down to the diagonal subgroup and gives a mass for the gauge boson while preserving the baryon number .",
    "we now try to find such a minimum by including soft terms in the potential .",
    "the mapping of the soft supersymmetry breaking terms into the dual theory has been studied in refs .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , simple mapping relations were found between the electric and the magnetic pictures .",
    "the soft terms in the dual picture can be parametrized by @xmath72 in the free magnetic range , @xmath73 , the relations are @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are parameters , and @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are anomalous dimensions of @xmath50 , @xmath53 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "the gauge couplings @xmath85 and @xmath86 are those of the electric theory ( @xmath7 ) and the magnetic theory ( @xmath15 ) , respectively .",
    "we should add positive @xmath87 in the electric picture .",
    "this means @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , @xmath89 it is interesting to note that @xmath90 is an unstable point .",
    "this indeed triggers the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the scalar fields have potential from three sources , the @xmath91-term potential from the superpotential in eq .  , the @xmath92-term from the gauge interactions , and the soft terms in eq .  : @xmath93 the @xmath92-term potential is given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the coupling constant of the @xmath96 gauge interaction .    since @xmath97 has a linear term and the positive mass squared in eq",
    ", @xmath97 can be stabilized at @xmath98 taking @xmath99 in the electric picture , the vev of @xmath97 is large compared to the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters and can be smaller than @xmath64 where the use of duality and weak couplings are justified . with this vev , the @xmath60 and @xmath61 obtain supersymmetric mass terms and thus decouple .",
    "once @xmath60 and @xmath61 get heavy , the system reduces to a model with @xmath53 , @xmath59 , and @xmath100 .",
    "this is the linearized hidden local symmetry , or the landau - ginzburg model in the magnetic picture .",
    "other light fields , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are not directly coupled to this hidden local sector . since they are stabilized by the soft terms",
    ", one can ignore those fields for the discussion of the vacuum .",
    "the fermionic partners of @xmath102 and @xmath103 later obtain masses by the vev of @xmath53 and @xmath59 .",
    "the fermionic component of @xmath97 remains massless at tree level .",
    "the non - perturbative superpotential , @xmath104 , together with the vev of @xmath100 gives a mass to this field .    by minimizing the potential",
    ", one can find a vacuum with @xmath105 where the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken and all the gauge bosons obtain masses while , of course , the pions remain massless . in this vacuum , the dual gauge group @xmath15 and the diagonal part of the chiral symmetry @xmath106 @xmath12 @xmath13 is locked , leaving the global @xmath107 symmetry ( the isospin symmetry ) unbroken .",
    "this is exactly the structure of the hidden local symmetry , where @xmath20 is now identified as the magnetic @xmath15 gauge group .",
    "the pion decay constant @xmath108 and the @xmath43 parameter are respectively given by @xmath109 and @xmath110 as we know already , @xmath52 can not be realized in this model .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : region ] the parameter region where a stable minimum with the vevs in eq .",
    "is found . in the figure , we have used a relation @xmath111 .",
    "when this relation is imposed , the stability of the vacuum requires , @xmath112 and @xmath113 where @xmath114 eq .",
    "gives @xmath115 .",
    "when @xmath116 is further imposed , we find a stronger constraint @xmath117        the vacuum exists even in the limit where the @xmath96 gauge interaction is extremely weak .",
    "this means that a scale where the @xmath96 gauge coupling hits the landau pole can be arbitrarily high , that we want to be at least higher than the dynamical scale @xmath64 for the model to be well - defined .",
    "therefore , one can freely take very small mass parameters so that all the interactions are weak at the scale of @xmath108 , and thus the analysis at tree level is reliable .",
    "we now have established the presence of the vacuum in eq .   in the weakly coupled regime .",
    "the vacuum has the same structure of the hidden local symmetry where the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the @xmath0 meson is identified as the magnetic gauge boson .",
    "its mass prevents a magnetic flux of @xmath15 to enter the vacuum , describing the confinement in the electric picture if the seiberg duality is the electric - magnetic duality .",
    "the fermion components of @xmath53 , @xmath59 , and @xmath100 all obtain masses when @xmath118 .",
    "weinberg and witten have shown that the massless gauge boson can not be created by the global current  @xcite .",
    "our @xmath0 meson as the magnetic gauge boson may sound contradicting to this theorem since the @xmath0 meson couples to the flavor current",
    ". however , the @xmath0 meson in our framework couples to the global current only after the dual color - flavor locking .",
    "therefore , at the massless point , the dual color and the flavor symmetry is not related , and thus the @xmath0 meson does not couple to the global current in the massless limit .",
    "in the following we try to see if how well the vaccum found in the previous section describes the hadron world in real qcd .",
    "most of the discussions are qualitative and sometimes speculative , but we can provide new interpretations of the nature of hadrons .      since the model ,",
    "supersymmetric @xmath5 gauge theory with @xmath120 flavors , is in the conformal window , we can not take the weakly coupled limit in the infrared .",
    "nevertheless , one can argue that the dual picture is still more weakly coupled compared to the electric one . in the regime of the conformal field theory ,",
    "anomalous dimensions of @xmath53 , @xmath59 , and @xmath100 fields are , respectively , @xmath121 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , which may be small enough to justify the expansion in terms of those fields around the free theory .    in the conformal window ,",
    "the predictions for the soft parameters are different from the free magnetic case .",
    "in fact , the soft terms ( except for the @xmath123 term ) approach to zero if the hierarchy of the dynamical scale and the mass parameters ( @xmath124 and soft terms ) is large enough . however , when we discuss applications to phenomenology , we are interested in the case with no hierarchy where there is no prediction on the size or relations among supersymmetry breaking terms .",
    "we , therefore , treat them as free parameters for the analysis .",
    "the boson sector of the model contains various massive and massless modes .",
    "we propose to identify them as light mesons in qcd .",
    "in addition to the massless nambu - goldstone particles , @xmath125 ( and @xmath126 at this stage ) , our model contains massive modes :    * @xmath127 as the magnetic gauge boson , * @xmath128 as the @xmath96 gauge boson , * @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 as the cp - even trace parts of @xmath53 , @xmath59 and @xmath100 , * @xmath132 as the uneaten cp - odd trace part of @xmath53 , @xmath59 and @xmath100 , * @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 as the cp - even traceless parts of @xmath53 , @xmath59 and @xmath100 , and * @xmath136 as the uneaten cp - odd traceless part of @xmath53 , @xmath59 and @xmath100 .",
    "there should be three cp - even isospin - triplet scalars ( called @xmath137 ) as mixtures of @xmath53 , @xmath59 and @xmath100 .",
    "we could not find one of them in the table in @xcite .    in the potential , there are numbers of parameters : @xmath138 it is probably not very meaningful to try to fit the hadron spectrum with those parameters since we already know that the phenomenologically favorable value , @xmath56 , can not be obtained at tree level .",
    "however , from the special shape of the potential , one can find sum rules independent of parameters : @xmath139 @xmath140 @xmath141 where @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) are the three mass eigenstates corresponding to mixtures of three cp - even isospin singlet ( triplet ) part of @xmath53 , @xmath59 , and @xmath100 , and @xmath144 and @xmath145 are massive states of the cp - odd isospin singlet and triplet scalars , respectively .",
    "the sum rule in eq .   can be tested by inputting masses listed above .",
    "the agreement is at the level of @xmath146 as a heavier @xmath126 .",
    "] , which we think is good enough since we expect a quantum correction of @xmath147 , non - perturbative effects , and also corrections from finite quark masses which we discuss later . the second sum rule in eq .   can not be tested since we could not find three @xmath137 s in the hadron spectrum .",
    "the sum rule suggest that the missing one is very light .",
    "the third one in eq .   agrees very well although it is not surprising from the view point of the quark model .",
    "we have so far ignored the finite masses for the quarks .",
    "the effects of the finite quark mass can be taken into account by adding a mass term @xmath148 in the superpotential in the electric picture . in the magnetic picture",
    ", this mass term induces a linear term of the meson , @xmath149 which explicitly breaks the chiral symmetry .",

    "the size is suppressed by a factor of @xmath153 compared to the scale of the @xmath0 meson mass .",
    "this is not quite a suppression factor when we input @xmath154 , and thus one can only make a qualitative argument .",
    "the above superpotential is generated by the non - perturbative effect , such as the instanton configurations of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "in this view , the @xmath0 meson is responsible for the solution to the @xmath152 problem .",
    "there is a stable string configuration associated with the spontaneous @xmath96 breaking by the vevs of the dual squarks .",
    "this type of string has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite where its connection to confinement has been emphasized .",
    "the string solution involves the non - trivial configurations of the @xmath15 gauge fields as well as @xmath96 .",
    "the solution is called a non - abelian vortex string as it non - trivially transforms under the unbroken @xmath107 isospin symmetry .",
    "the string carries the non - abelian magnetic flux ( which is the color flux in the electric picture ) , and thus can be interpreted as the qcd string .",
    "it is amusing that the non - trivial configurations of the @xmath0 and @xmath155 mesons can be interpreted as the qcd string !",
    "the qcd string is a singularity in the vacuum at which @xmath0 and @xmath155 become massless  @xcite and thus allows the color flux to penetrate .",
    "the qcd string should be unstable in the presence of the quarks . in order to describe the instability at the length scale of @xmath156 ,",
    "one probably needs a larger framework which explains the nature of @xmath96 and extra flavors .",
    "for example , the meta - stable string and its connection to color confinement has been discussed in the softly broken @xmath1 theory in ref .",
    "@xcite where a @xmath152 factor originates from a breaking of the @xmath157 gauge group .",
    "it is interesting to note that the fermionic components of @xmath102 , @xmath158 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 have the quantum numbers of quarks if we gauge the @xmath159 global symmetry .",

    "the dual quarks @xmath60 and @xmath61 obtain masses by the vev of @xmath97 . in the language of the hidden local symmetry sketched in figure  [ fig : quiver ] , those are matter fields living in the middle site .",
    "the fields living in the left and right site , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , obtain masses through the mixing with @xmath60 and @xmath61 induced by the chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath160 ) .",

    "however , these `` quarks '' can not be the endpoints of the string we discussed above .",
    "the string solution carries the magnetic flux of @xmath96 whereas the `` quarks '' only have electric charges .",
    "again , we probably need a larger framework to understand the whole picture .",
    "there are a few ways to describe baryons in this model .",
    "the simplest one is to introduce a massive vector - like pair of fermions which transform as fundamental and anti - fundamental under the @xmath15 dual gauge group ( the middle site in figure  [ fig : quiver ] ) .",
    "since they are massive , one can assume that those are lost in passing through the seiberg duality .",
    "in this case , the baryons are flavor singlet and massive in the chiral symmetric phase , but after the ( dual ) color - flavor locking by the vev of @xmath53 and @xmath59 , the fermions carry the same quantum numbers as the proton and the neutron .",
    "another way is to argue that the skyrmion solution describes the baryons  @xcite . in the above two cases",
    ", one can explain the universality of the @xmath0 meson couplings , @xmath161 , which was not automatic in the hidden local symmetry  @xcite .",
    "of course , the baryons can be three - quark states made of the constituent quarks we found above .",
    "however , in this case , the coupling universality is not automatic .",
    "the coupling depends on the mixing between @xmath60 and @xmath102 and also on how baryons are composed of .",
    "the electroweak symmetry breaking in the standard model has the same structure as chiral symmetry breaking in qcd once we embed the @xmath162 @xmath12 @xmath163 gauge group into the global symmetry , @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "the sqcd model can be thought of as a deformation of the qcd - like technicolor theory where we have a weakly coupled description .    for concreteness , we take the model with @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and weakly gauge @xmath11 which is identified as @xmath162 of the weak interaction .",

    "if we put @xmath169 as an estimate motivated by qcd , we obtain @xmath170 .",
    "this is quite big .",
    "however , given that there is a higgs boson , the situation is slightly better compared to the qcd - like technicolor theories if the higgs boson is light enough .",
