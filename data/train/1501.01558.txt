    "one of the interesting discoveries in the iron - based chalcogenides has been a successful intercalation of fese by alkaline atoms .",
    "the intercalated fese , forming a new a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 ( a = k , rb , cs ) family , shows a t@xmath3 as high as 32 k  @xcite and , more importantly , exhibits several unique microstructural characteristics , such as a large magnetic moment per fe site , intrinsic fe vacancy order in the @xmath4-plane and an antiferromagnetic order in the @xmath5-direction  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 also shows phase separation  @xcite , in which a magnetically ordered phase with an expanded lattice and a nonmagnetic phase with a compressed lattice coexist  @xcite .",
    "the phase separation in a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 has been studied by several techniques  @xcite , probing different properties .",
    "in particular , detailed temperature dependent neutron diffraction studies on superconducting a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 ( a = k , rb , cs , tl ) have revealed same fe vacancy ordered crystal structure and the same block antiferromagnetic order in all these materials  @xcite . the intensity of the magnetic bragg peak , providing information on the iron magnetic moment , shows a continuous increase by lowering temperature , however , this behavior is interrupted by a flat plateau when t@xmath3 is approached .",
    "muon spin relaxation ( @xmath6sr ) experiments have shown phase separation with @xmath788 - 90% of the sample volume to exhibit large magnetic moment while @xmath710 - 12% of the sample to remain paramagnetic @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions have been reached by nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments @xcite showing distinct spectra originating from a majority antiferromagnetic and a minority metallic phase .",
    "the nmr results have also revealed a sharp drop in the relaxation rate and knight shift on cooling across t@xmath3 , indicating development of a field distribution due to the appearance of a vortex state .",
    "optical properties of superconducting k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath8 , have shown that @xmath710% sample volume is covered by highly distorted metallic inclusions in an insulating matrix , suggesting a filamentary network of conducting regions @xcite and josephson - coupling plasmons @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath9fe - m@xmath10ssbauer spectroscopy has revealed phase separarion in @xmath788% magnetic and @xmath712% nonmagnetic fe@xmath11 species @xcite . a recent space",
    "resolved photoemission has provided further information on the peculiar electronic phase separation in metallic filamentary phase and majority insulating texture @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is now known that the majority phase is insulating with a stoichimetry of a@xmath12fe@xmath13se@xmath2 ( 245 ) containing iron vacancy order and block antiferromagnetism with large magnetic moment ( @xmath73.3 @xmath14 ) while the minority phase is metallic with a stoichiometry of a@xmath0fe@xmath8se@xmath2 ( 122 ) .    very recently , the coexisting electronic phases in k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 have been studied using high energy spectroscopy  @xcite , revealing different phases to be characterized by different fe valence and local magnetic moment . in this work , we have further exploited x - ray emission ( xes ) and high resolution x - ray absorption ( xas ) spectroscopy to study correlation between the superconductivity and the electronic / magnetic phase redistribution as a function of temperature . while xes has been used to investigate the evolution of local fe magnetic moment @xmath6 , xas has been exploited to study unoccupied electronic states , corresponding to different electronic phases .",
    "the magnetic moment @xmath6 shows anomalous temperature dependence with a sharp drop at the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "the results also reveal that the coexisting electronic phases with fe@xmath11 high spin ( hs ) and low spin ( ls ) exchange their spectral weights across the superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath732 k ) . on the other hand , by annealing the sample across the phase separation and iron - vacancy ordering temperatures ( @xmath7520 k and @xmath7580 k respectively ) , the mean local moment @xmath6 is decreased , and the hs - ls spectral exchange across t@xmath3 gets suppressed with disappearance of the superconductivity .",
    "the xes and high resolution xas measurements were carried out on well characterized single crystals of k@xmath15fe@xmath1se@xmath2 .",
    "after the growth using the bridgman method , the crystals were sealed into a quartz tube and annealed for 12 hours in vaccum at 600@xmath16c .",
    "the crystals were characterized for their structure and phase purity by x - ray diffraction measurements  @xcite .",
    "the electric and magnetic characterizations were performed by resistivity measurements in a ppms ( quantum design ) and magnetization measurements in a squid magnetometer ( quantum design ) .",
    "the samples exhibit a sharp superconducting transition at @xmath17 k with a transition width of @xmath71 k in the temperature dependent resistivity signal .",
    "the superconducting volume fraction was found to be @xmath710% at 2 k. the samples were exposed to air only for a couple of minutes while mounting on the sample holder . for the rest of the time the samples were manipulated in a glovbox or were kept in vacuum .",
    "the spectroscopy measurements were performed at the beamline id16 of the european synchrotron radiation facility .",
    "the experimental setup consists of a spectrometer based on the simultaneous use of a bent analyzer ge(620 ) crystal ( bending radius r = 1 m ) and a pixelated position - sensitive timepix detector  @xcite in rowland circle geometry .",
    "the scattering plane was horizontal and parallel to the linear polarization vector of the incident x - rays .",
    "the measurements were carried out fixing the sample surface  ( the @xmath4-plane of the k@xmath15fe@xmath1se@xmath2 single crystal )  at  @xmath7  45@xmath18  from the incoming beam direction and the scattering angle 2@xmath19 at @xmath7 90@xmath18 .",
    "the total energy resolution was about 1.1 ev  full width at half maximum .",
    "for the low temperature measurements the sample was placed in a cryogenic environment , while for the high temperature measurements it was placed in an oven .",
    "firstly , we have cooled down the sample from room temperature ( rt@xmath7300 k ) to 18 k , across t@xmath3 .",
    "this was followed by warming the sample up to 600 k , destroying the phase separation ( at @xmath7520 k ) and disordering the fe vacancies ( at @xmath7580 k ) . at the end , we have cooled down the sample again to 18 k. the sample temperatures during the measurements were controlled with an accuracy of  @xmath201  k.",

    "figure  1  ( a ) shows fe k@xmath22 emission spectra measured on k@xmath15fe@xmath1se@xmath2 at different temperatures . in the crystal - field picture the overall spectral shape is dominated by the ( @xmath23,@xmath24 ) exchange interactions  @xcite , and the presence ( absence ) of a pronounced feature at lower energy ( k@xmath22 ) is an indication of a hs ( ls ) state of fe  @xcite .",

    "1(b ) to 1(g ) ) shows that the local fe magnetic moment @xmath6 is higher for the latter . it should be noted that the @xmath6 for the present sample is smaller than the one for an air - exposed k@xmath15fe@xmath1se@xmath2 sample  @xcite",

    "1(g ) ] .",
    "detailed temperature evolution of the iad is shown in figure 2 . by cooling from rt",
    ", the iad shows an anomalous behavior , representing an abnormal evolution of @xmath6 .",
    "indeed , the iad shows a gradual decrease and an increase ( with a local cusp - like anomaly at @xmath7 170 k ) before showing a sharp drop at t@xmath3 . this is a clear indication of a lowering of the local magnetic moment in the superconducting state .",
    "earlier neutron diffraction studies on superconducting a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 have shown that the temperature dependent magnetic bragg peak intensity exhibits a plateau below t@xmath3 @xcite , indicating an interesting interplay between the ordered magnetic moment and superconductivity . in the present work , the local magnetic moment probed by the xes is found to show a sharp drop at t@xmath3 , revealing that there is hs - ls transition and the resulting magnetic fluctuations have a direct relation with the superconductivity in phase separated k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 .",
    "the iad shows a gradual decrease with increasing temperature , revealing a transition - like behavior around the phase separation and iron - vacancy disorder temperatures ( @xmath7520 k and 580 k respectively ) .",
    "indeed , by increasing temperature from rt to 600 k the k@xmath21 emission line shifts towards lower energy [ fig .",
    "1(a ) ] and the k@xmath26 spectral weight is suppressed .",
    "these results suggest that the system is undergoing a change in the spin configuration across the phase separation temperature of @xmath7520 k  @xcite , reaching a minimum around 580 k [ fig .",
    "2 ] where the block antiferromagnetic order is known to get suppressed . cooling down to rt , the sample does not recover the initial conditions , consistent with a glassy nature @xcite . by cooling after the annealing , the discontinuity across t@xmath25 , evident in the cooling cycle ,",
    "does not appear .",
    "magnetic susceptibility measurements on the annealed sample does not reveal any significant superconducting signal .",

    "the spectra are measured by collecting the fe k@xmath21 emission as a function of incident energy , and normalized with respect to the atomic absorption estimated by a linear fit far away from the absorption edge .",
    "the xas spectra show an asymmetric single pre - edge peak p  @xcite , a shoulder a and broad near edge features b and c. the broad features indicate the system to have large atomic disorder , consistent with local structural studies  @xcite .",

    "the difference spectra reveal spectral weight redistribution from the lower energy side to the higher energy side of the pre - edge peak .",
    "to evaluate the temperature dependent redistribution of the spectral weight , we have performed a curve fitting of the background subtracted xas spectra with two gaussian functions in the pre - edge peak region .",
    "the background is given by a constant arctangent function approximating the atomic absorption .",
    "two gaussian functions of constant width and energy position were enough to describe the background subtracted pre - edge peak p. we have shown the zoomed absorption spectrum in the pre - edge peak region containing the background function along with the two gaussian components ( p1 and p2 ) of the background subtracted spectrum and the fit as fig .",
    "let us discuss the possible origin of the two gaussian peaks p1 and p2 .",
    "it is known that fe k - edge absorption pre - peak is sensitive to the fe spin state in iron complexes  @xcite .",
    "in addition , earlier high pressure xas experiments on fese and rb@xmath15fe@xmath1se@xmath2 have revealed a crossover from hs fe@xmath11 to ls fe@xmath11 , evidenced by an appearance of a ls fe@xmath11 peak structure at @xmath7 1 ev higher in energy than the hs fe@xmath11 peak  @xcite .",
    "we are also aware of the fact that different phases coexist in the superconducting k@xmath15fe@xmath1se@xmath2 : ( i ) a majority semiconducting and magnetic 245-phase with iron vacancy order , and ; ( ii ) a metallic and nonmagnetic disordered 122- phase .",
    "the coexisting phases are characterized by slightly different fe oxidation states , i.e. , 2 + , for the 245 , and slightly less than 2 + , for the 122 phase  @xcite .",
    "small differences in the oxidation state are hardly detectable by the main rising absorption edge that appears to be influenced by the glassy local structure  @xcite .",
    "the 245 and the 122 phases have similar structure with the latter being slightly compressed in the plane and expanded in the out of plane  @xcite . these phases also have different iron spin state  @xcite , with the majority phase being in hs fe@xmath11 state while the minority phase appears to be in ls state .",
    "therefore , we can assign qualitatively the two gaussian components p1 and p2 to hs fe@xmath11 majority phase and ls fe@xmath11 minority phase .",
    "considering the fact that the minority and majority phases are known to contribute about 10 - 20% and 80 - 90% respectively , the spectral weight of the majority phase ( minority phase ) with hs ( ls ) fe@xmath11 state counting about 78% ( 22% ) at rt is in fair agreement with the present assignment .",
    "temperature evolution of the relative spectral weight of the majority phase ( defined as the ratio of the intensity of p1 to the total intensity , i.e. , p1+p2 ) is shown in fig .",
    "the hs phase tends to decrease with decreasing temperature from 300 k to 180 k , revealing a cusp - like anomaly around 180 k with maximum weight being @xmath780@xmath30 before a sharp drop to @xmath770% around the t@xmath3 . on the other hand , with increasing temperature from 300 k the spectral weight of the hs phase gradually decreases with a small discontinuity above the phase separation temperature of @xmath7520 k and iron vacancy disorder temperature of @xmath7580 k. in general",
    ", temperature evolution of the relative weight of the majority phase appears consistent with the iad representing variation of the local fe moment @xmath6 [ fig . 1 ] .",
    "this justifies the assignment of the p1 and p2 due to the two coexisting phases , characterized by hs and ls fe@xmath11 states , with hs phase contributing about 70 - 80@xmath30 of the total while the remaining phase should be due to ls fe@xmath11 phase .",
    "this affirmation agrees with different experimental studies showing that the magnetic phase is the majority phase while the minority phase should be one that becomes superconducting by cooling  @xcite .",
    "again , it is interesting to note that , by cooling from 600 k to 400 k , the system does not recover the initial state .",
    "indeed , after the annealing , the discontinuity across t@xmath25 disappears , likely to be due to suppression of superconductivity or highly reduced volume fraction of the superconducting phase .",
    "hs domains gradually grow with cooling from 520 k to 300 k. ( b ) filamentary fe@xmath11 ls domain is established with cooling from 300 k to 180 k. ( c ) the interface region between the fe@xmath11 hs and fe@xmath11 ls domains becomes magnetic with cooling from 180 k to 32 k. ( d ) the magnetic interface state turns into the superconducting state with fe@xmath11 ls . ]    let us attempt to understand the xes and xas findings shown in fig . 2 and fig .",
    "4 , revealing an abnormal evolution of local fe magnetic moment and different electronic phases .",
    "we start our discussion for the cooling cycle from 300 k. it is clear that the local moment shows a decrease [ fig .",
    "2 ] , consistent with the decrease of the hs fe@xmath11 phase [ fig . 4 ] . with further cooling ,",
    "the fe magnetic moment shows an increase before showing a sharp drop at the superconducting transition .",
    "this is again consistent with the evolution of the hs fe@xmath11 phase fraction .",
    "however , the question is what is the origin of such an anomalous behavior of the phase fractions .    below @xmath7580",
    "k , the system undergoes ordering of the fe vacancy and nucleation of the hs fe@xmath11 phase with phase separation at @xmath7520 k. in going from 520 k to 300 k , the antiferromagnetic order is established and , consequently , the iad and fe@xmath11 hs fraction gradually increase with cooling [ fig .",
    "5(a ) ] . around 300 k , the filamentary and metallic ls fe@xmath11 state starts to grow at the boundary between the neighboring fe@xmath11 hs domains . in going from 300 k to 180 k",
    ", the filamentary fe@xmath11 ls fraction gradually increases , likely to be due to chemical pressure from the majority phase , and the fe@xmath11 hs fraction decreases [ fig .",
    "5(b ) ] , which is also consistent with the decrease of the iad .",
    "these behaviors are basically consistent with the previous works on electrical transport showing anomalous temperature dependent resistivity @xcite .",
    "the results are also in agreement with the magnetic @xcite , optical @xcite and microscopy measurements @xcite .",
    "the most striking result is the increase of the fe@xmath11 hs fraction with cooling from 180 k although the system exhibits a good metallic behavior in the temperature range .",
    "this observation suggests that the fe@xmath11 ls state at the interface region again tends to be magnetic but stay metallic as schematically shown in fig .",
    "one possible explanation is that the magnetic fluctuation and local spin moment are induced by orbital selective mott transition in this temperature range .",
    "such a phase has been proposed recently for k@xmath15fe@xmath1se@xmath2 on the basis of angle - resolved photoemission results @xcite .",
    "thus , the apparent increase of the local magnetic moment below 180 k can be explained by the orbital selective localization of the fe 3@xmath28 electrons and resulting strong magnetic fluctuations .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the recent high pressure measurements underlining the importance of the insulating texture in the superconductivity of a@xmath15fe@xmath1se@xmath2@xcite . across @xmath31 ,",
    "the interface metallic region with the localized magnetic moment turns into the superconducting ls state , connecting all filamentary metallic phase , as illustrated in fig .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the fig .",
    "5 provides a likely interpretaion of the anomalous behavior of local magnetic moment [ fig . 2 ] and pre - peak intensity [ fig .",
    "4 ] as a function of temperature .",
    "however , it is difficult to argue that p1 and p2 in fig . 3 to provide quantitative estimation of the hs and ls phases since the iron vacancy configuration in the majority phase itself evolves with temperature .",
    "in summary , we have employed high energy xes and xas to investigate local magnetic moment and coexisting electronic phases in k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 as a function of temperature , across the superconducting and phase separation temperatures .",
    "we have found coexisting fe@xmath11 electronic phases with the glassy character of k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 compound .",
    "the results provide a clear evidence of the interplay between the electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom for the superconductivity . across t@xmath3 ,",
    "the ls phase increases at the expenses of the interface phase between ls and hs phases .",
    "the hs to ls fraction exchange across t@xmath3 is suppressed after annealing despite a substantial presence of the ls configuration , likely to be due to absence of a well defined interface phase .",
    "the results suggest that a delicate interplay of local strain between the mott insulator and metallic filaments with an interface phase is the key for the superconducting phenomena of inhomogeneous k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 system .",
