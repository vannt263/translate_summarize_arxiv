    "the molybdenum dichalcogenides belong to the large family of layered transition metal dichalcogenides whose crystal structure results from the stacking of sheets of hexagonally packed atoms .",
    "it consists of weakly coupled sandwich layers in which a mo - atom layer is enclosed within two chalcogen layers ( x = s , se , te ) .",
    "all three mox@xmath0 compounds crystallize in the 2h@xmath5 structure and mos@xmath0 , as well as , mose@xmath0 also crystallize in the 3r structure . in both of these polytype structures",
    "the coordination of the metal atoms is trigonal prismatic . in this work ,",
    "2h@xmath5 samples are investigated .",
    "for mote@xmath0 a phase transition from the semiconducting 2h@xmath5-type @xmath1-mote@xmath0 to a metallic polytype , @xmath6-mote@xmath0 , with a monoclinic structure having a distorted octahedral coordination is known@xcite .",
    "the 2h@xmath5-polytype , in the following assigned as mote@xmath0 , is stable below @xmath7c .",
    "the mox@xmath0 compounds are indirect semiconductors with indirect ( direct ) band gaps of 1.29 ( 1.78 )  ev for mos@xmath0 , 1.10 ( 1.42 )  ev for mose@xmath0 , and 1.00 ( 1.10 )  ev for mote@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "since the optical band gaps are matching well with the solar spectrum these materials are used for electrodes in high efficiency photo - electrochemical ( pec ) cells @xcite . in the molybdenum",
    "dichalcogenides the phototransitions involve non - bonding @xmath8 orbitals of mo atoms .",
    "therefore , these materials can be expected to resist hole - induced corrosion @xcite . despite of the major importance of the mox@xmath0 compounds in solar cell production , to date no comparative band structure determination from experiment and theory has been reported .",
    "in general , it is expected that the gross features of the band structures of all three dichalcogenides are quite similar but , in addition , also some characteristic differences are to be expected .",
    "several band structure calculations were performed so far which were used to explain experimental results from absorption measurements @xcite and early photoemission work @xcite . from the literature about these materials",
    "no consistent picture emerges ( see e.g.   @xcite for a review , and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , we address in this work the electronic band structure of all three binary dichalcogenides on equal footing by arpes measurements and by state - of - the - art _ ab - initio _ band structure calculations . in experiment ,",
    "high - resolution photoelectron spectrometers ( with respect to emission angle and energy ) are used .",
    "in addition , the constant - final - state ( cfs ) mode is applied to obtain data which shows low @xmath2 dispersion . as to the theory , the electronic properties of all three molybdenum dichalcogenides are calculated within density functional theory ( dft ) employing the local density approximation ( lda )  @xcite and spin - orbit interaction is included .",

    ", a mo atom layer is sandwiched between two chalcogen layers .",
    "the two x - mo - x sandwich layers per unit cell are laterally displaced with respect to each other so that the mo atoms of the upper sandwich layer are directly above the chalcogen atoms of the lower sandwich layer in the unit cell and vice versa .",
    "the sandwich layers are coupled only by weak van der waals forces giving rise to the quasi - two - dimensional character of the electronic structure .",

    "it is obvious from tab .",
    "[ tab : strcdata ] that the interlayer distance @xmath11 , as well as , the lattice parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 increase from mos@xmath0 to mote@xmath0 mainly due to the increasing ionic radius of the chalcogen ions , while the @xmath16 ratio remains nearly constant .",

    "the latter authors also concluded that the double emission feature at the k - point is the signature of the two initial states of the excitons a and b. to attribute the double emission feature at the k point to the initial states of the excitons a and b is at variance , however , with several investigations using optical absorption measurements @xcite leading to the result that appropriate transitions for the a and b excitons should occur at the @xmath4 point .",

    "it must be concluded accordingly that the double emission feature x , y at the k point does not correspond to initial states of the excitons a and b @xcite . in line with the optical absorption measurements cited above and from the location of the vbm at the @xmath4 point it is suggested that the topmost occupied state at @xmath4 is the initial state for the a and b excitons .      in figs .",

    "a projected band structure has not been used since the respective critical points have been determined experimentally .",
    "the lower unoccupied bands are also shown . except for the gap problem within the lda",

    "furthermore , the valence - band maximum is found at @xmath4 in all three compounds .",
    "this is confirmed for all three materials by the experimental data . from the present band structure calculations it follows that the energetically lowest indirect transition is from @xmath4 to @xmath22k and",
    "the lowest direct transition occurs at k.    a close look at the valence - band structure of all three materials reveals a very good general agreement between measured and calculated bands .",
    "the total valence - band width is found to decrease from mos@xmath0 over mose@xmath0 to mote@xmath0 both in experiment and theory .",
    "the dispersion of the uppermost bands away from @xmath4 towards k and m reveal also quantitative matching .",
    "however , the energetic positions of the calculated bands in the vicinity of the high - symmetry point k differ with a maximum difference of 200  mev in the case of mose@xmath0 .",
    "also the calculated splitting of the bands at k ( already discussed above ) is about 100 mev larger than observed in experiment .",
    "the general trend in decreasing binding energy of the top of the valence bands at m , as observed in experiment , results from theory , as well .",
    "only the absolute energetic location of the topmost state at m is about 200  mev too low as compared to the photoemission results .",
    "it must be emphasized that such differences between experiment and theory in the range of a few 100  mev are close to the theoretical uncertainty that can be achieved nowadays .    in the vicinity of",
    "about -1  ev a dispersionless band is observed in the @xmath4a direction ( see figs .  [",

    ", this band is found experimentally in mos@xmath0 to be @xmath23100  mev below a rather dispersionless band in the calculated band structure and about 100  mev above the respective band for mose@xmath0 and mote@xmath0 . on the other hand , along @xmath4a only in the case of mote@xmath0 this band results from the theory .    in band structure calculations for the ( 0001)-surface of mox@xmath0 ( x = s , se , te ) , which we have carried out using a slab of 9 sandwich layers ( method as described in  @xcite ) , we have found states located at the first few sandwich layers of the surface in this energy range .",
    "the respective bands exhibit only a small dispersion around the center of the surface brillouin zone in agreement with the experimentally observed bands .",
    "therefore , one might attribute these bands in the photoemission data to surface states .",
    "in our investigations , we have determined the complete valence - band structure of mos@xmath0 , mose@xmath0 , and @xmath1-mote@xmath0 on equal footing by experiment and theory .",
    "it was found that the valence bands resulting from angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy in the constant - final - state mode and from _ ab - initio _ calculations are in very good overall agreement .",
