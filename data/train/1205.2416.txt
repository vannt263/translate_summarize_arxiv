    "in gaas and many other semiconductors , electron spins and nuclear spins interact with each other via the hyperfine interaction  @xcite .",
    "this interaction forms the basis for many ingenious methods to detect and manipulate nuclear spins via the electronic states  @xcite .",
    "conversely , nuclear spins can also be used to probe and study electronic states in molecules and various condensed matter systems .",
    "for instance , the electron spin polarization can be measured with the knight shift in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments  @xcite .",
    "nuclear spin relaxation measurements yield important information about the electronic systems  @xcite .    an essential ingredient of a nuclear spin relaxation measurement is to first drive the nuclear spin system out of equilibrium .",
    "nmr provides the most direct way for eliciting changes in the degree of nuclear spin polarization .",
    "the rf radiation in nmr experiments , however , unavoidably raises the electron temperature in the sample , in particular when operating at dilution refrigerator temperatures .",
    "this is detrimental to the fragile states such as those formed as a result of electron correlations in the fractional quantum hall regime .",
    "fortunately , alternative methods for manipulating nuclear spin polarization are available . they are based on the spin flip - flop term of the hyperfine interaction : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the hyperfine constant , and @xmath7(@xmath8 ) and @xmath9(@xmath10 ) are raising ( lowering ) operators for the nuclear and electron spins , respectively .",
    "this term describes processes in which the flip of an electron spin simultaneously triggers the reversal of a nuclear spin . driving the electron spin system out of thermal equilibrium by an external source ( e.g.  microwave , light , or electric current ) will cause the electron spins to relax back .",
    "the electron relaxation is accompanied by polarization of the nuclear spins .",
    "this dynamic nuclear polarization ( dnp ) process has been realized in numerous experiments , including optical pumping by circularly polarized light , @xcite electron spin resonance ( esr )  @xcite , inter - edge channel scattering in the quantum hall regime  @xcite , current induced scattering near landau level filling factor @xmath112/3  @xcite , and other fractional fillings  @xcite .",
    "it also occurs in the breakdown regime of the integer and fractional quantum hall effects  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we highlight a different method for manipulating the nuclear spin polarization",
    ". it does not rely on the aforementioned conventional dynamic nuclear polarization processes .",
    "it will be referred to as electrically controlled thermal depolarization .",
    "it is based on current induced heating in the two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) when a partially polarized composite fermion liquid at half filling of the lowest landau level forms .",
    "the strong hyperfine interaction transfers energy from electrons to nuclear spins and hence raises the entropy as well as the temperature of the nuclear spin system .",
    "significant changes in nuclear spin polarization can be obtained with low current densities .",
    "in contrast to previously reported techniques for electrical control of the nuclear spin polarization , this @xmath0 based technique can in principle produce spatially homogeneous changes in the nuclear spin polarization across a large area .",
    "the changes in nuclear spin polarization are measured with two different methods .",
    "one is based on the spin transition in the @xmath0 state itself  @xcite , and the other relies on the spin phase transition at @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear spin depolarization induced by the current can be described by a curie law .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : theory ] , we give a brief description of the composite fermion picture and the spin transitions at fillings 1/2 and 2/3 .",
    "sec.[sec : methods ] is devoted to the experimental details , including the sample preparation , the measurement setup , and the principles of the nuclear magnetometry using the 1/2 and 2/3 spin transitions .",
    "effects associated with the finite thickness of the two - dimensional electron system will also be discussed in this section . in sec.[sec : result ] the main experimental results will be presented .",
    "they include the current induced effects on the nuclear spins and electron transport properties .",
    "the mechanism for electrical controlled nuclear spin depolarization will be discussed based on measurements of electron temperatures . finally , concluding remarks will be given in sec.[sec : summary ] .",
    "for a 2d electron system with density @xmath12 subject to a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath13 , all electrons reside in the lowest landau level when @xmath13 exceeds @xmath14",
    "( i.e. landau level filling factor @xmath15 ) , where @xmath12 is the density of the 2des , @xmath16 is the planck constant , and @xmath17 is the electron s charge .",
    "the orbital degree of freedom is no longer relevant and the physics is governed by electron - electron interactions .",
    "they give rise to a large number of fractional quantum hall states when the disorder is sufficiently weak  @xcite .",
    "the many - body wavefunctions proposed by laughlin provide a solid foundation for understanding the nature of these states  @xcite .",
    "it is however also possible to describe the appearance of these correlated fractional quantum hall ground states in an intuitive , single particle picture by introducing quasi - particles referred to as composite fermions  @xcite .",
    "a composite fermion ( cf ) comprises one electron and an even number ( @xmath18 ) of magnetic flux quanta .",
    "cfs no longer experience the external magnetic field , but a drastically reduced effective magnetic field which in a mean field approximation  @xcite is given by @xmath19 and vanishes exactly at even denominator filling @xmath20 . at this filling composite fermions form a compressible fermi sea which in many ways resembles the 2d electron fermi liquid at zero magnetic field . at filling factors away from 1/q ,",
    "the landau quantization of composite fermions in a non - zero @xmath21 gives rise to the integer quantum hall effect of composite fermions .",
    "it is equivalent to the fractional quantum hall effect at fillings @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the number of filled cf landau levels .",
    "for example , the @xmath1 state corresponds to the integer quantum hall state of composite fermions with two attached flux quanta when two cf landau levels are completely filled .",
    "( a ) energy level diagram for filling factor 2/3 .",
    "the spin transition field @xmath24 is marked with the dotted line .",
    "when @xmath25 , the ground state is spin unpolarized with the composite fermion landau levels ( 0,@xmath26 ) and ( 0,@xmath27 ) occupied , while for @xmath28 the two filled levels are ( 0,@xmath26 ) and ( 1,@xmath26 ) , and the ground state becomes fully polarized ; ( b ) spin transition for a non - interacting and disorder free composite fermion system at @xmath3=1/2 .",
    "the density of states solely depends on the composite fermion effective mass .",
    "transition from partial to full spin polarization takes place when the zeeman energy surpasses the fermi energy.,width=7 ]    the cyclotron mass and landau quantization energy of composite fermions are not related to the conduction band mass of the electrons  @xcite .",
    "this has some important implications for the spin related physics in the fractional quantum hall regime . in the following ,",
    "we only discuss two cases which will be important for the nuclear magnetometry carried out in this work . for simplicity , we start our discussion with an ideal 2d electron system , whose wavefunction has zero spread in the growth direction",
    ". we also do not consider the effect of nuclear spin polarization .",
    "it will be treated in a subsequent subsection .    at filling factor 2/3 , composite fermions experience an effective ( perpendicular ) magnetic field of @xmath29 .",
    "the energy spectrum is quantized into a ladder of cf landau levels ( @xmath30 ) with a spacing of @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the free electron mass , and the composite fermion mass is written as @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "each of the cf landau levels is split into two spin sub - levels ( @xmath34 ) by the zeeman energy @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the total magnetic field .",
    "note the effective field only controls the orbital degree of freedom of the composite fermions . as shown in fig.1(a ) , energy levels ( 0,@xmath27 ) and ( 1,@xmath26 ) cross each other at perpendicular field @xmath37 due to the different field dependencies of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "when @xmath25 , the two occupied levels , ( 0,@xmath26 ) and ( 0,@xmath27 ) , have opposite spin orientation , so the ground state is spin unpolarized .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath28 the two filled levels , ( 0,@xmath26 ) and(1,@xmath26 ) , have identical spin orientations in fig .",
    "1(a ) and the ground state is fully spin polarized .",
    "the spin transition field @xmath24 satisfies @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the tilt angle , i.e. the angle between the total field @xmath36 and the perpendicular field @xmath13 . here",
    "the indices @xmath42 and @xmath43 indicate that we are dealing with a special case of zero thickness of the electron wavefunction and zero nuclear spin polarization .",
    "more general cases will be discussed in subsequent sections .    for the fermi sea at @xmath0 ,",
    "the composite fermion spins are not always fully polarized as well  @xcite .",
    "a transition from partial to full spin polarization takes place when the zeeman energy exceeds the fermi energy of the composite fermions . in the simplest model ,",
    "the composite fermions are treated as non - interacting particles and the disorder is ignored . under these assumptions ,",
    "the fermi energy can be written as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the cf fermi wavevector .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain that when the ( perpendicular ) magnetic field @xmath46 , the composite fermion sea becomes fully spin polarized ( see fig.1(b ) ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the spin transition field at @xmath1 only differs from that at @xmath0 by a factor of @xmath47 .",
    "a useful feature of the partially polarized fermi sea at @xmath0 is that the energy spectrum is continuous near the fermi energy for both spin populations .",
    "a spin flip of a composite fermion may require a change in orbital momentum , but costs no or very little energy just like a nuclear spin flop .",
    "hence , the interaction between nuclear spins and electron spins is expected to be strong .",
    "the situation resembles the korringa type of nuclear spin - electron spin interaction in simple metals  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in experiments the nuclear spin relaxation time has been found to be as short as @xmath48100s even at temperatures below @xmath49mk  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 state lends itself to manipulate nuclear spins because of the efficient coupling between these two spin systems .",
    "this will be the central theme of this paper .",
    "it should be pointed out that the transition fields given in the previous subsection are calculated for truly 2d systems . for a 2des which forms in a gaas / algaas quantum well or heterostructure , the finite thickness of the electron wavefunction in the growth direction softens the coulomb potential . when the magnetic length , @xmath50 , becomes comparable to the thickness of the electron wavefunction",
    ", the ratio @xmath51 , which determines the spin transition fields for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 , is no longer proportional to @xmath52 . in the strong @xmath13 limit ,",
    "the coulomb potential scales with @xmath53 instead of @xmath52 . as will be shown in sec.[subsec : two3rds ] , the finite thickness effect significantly modifies the spin transition field even for a narrow quantum well .",
    "a precise treatment of the finite thickness effect requires numerical calculations  @xcite , which are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "here we follow an approach introduced by zhang and das sarma  @xcite . according to their theoretical study ,",
    "a modified coulomb potential of the form @xmath54 provides a reasonably good approximation to more rigorous numerical calculations . here",
    "@xmath55 is a length parameter that can be viewed as the effective thickness of the electron wavefunction . in this model",
    "the coulomb energy follows @xmath56 , instead of @xmath57 in the zero thickness limit . for analyzing experiments ,",
    "it is useful to define @xmath58 , and rewrite the coulomb energy as @xmath59 if the tilt angle @xmath41 is small so that the orbital effect of the in - plane field is negligible , the spin transition field , taking into account the non - zero thickness of the 2des , can be written as @xmath60 here @xmath61 denotes the spin transition field for the case of zero - thickness , zero tilt angle , and no nuclear spin polarization .",
    "it equals @xmath62 and @xmath63 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "eq.([eq : btr_finite_thickness ] ) is quite different from the @xmath64 dependence expected for the zero - thickness 2des ( see eq.[eq : btr_two3rds ] ) .",
    "hence , the measurements in tilted fields can be used to evaluate how significant the finite thickness effect is .",
    "the zeeman term in the hamiltonian of the hyperfine interaction between an electron and the nuclei is @xmath65 the influence of the polarized nuclear spins on the electron zeeman splitting can be described in terms of an effective field @xmath66 @xmath67 for fully polarized nuclear spins in bulk gaas @xmath66 equals @xmath68 t .",
    "@xcite the minus sign reflects that @xmath69 is opposite to the external magnetic field @xmath70 .",
    "the nuclear spin polarizations of all three isotopes in gaas ( i.e.  @xmath71ga , @xmath72ga and @xmath73as ) follow the brillouin function .",
    "for small @xmath74 ( @xmath75tesla / mk approximately ) , this function can be simplified to a curie law form : @xmath76 for all nuclei in gaas , @xmath77 equals @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio . summing up the contributions from all three types of nuclei yields the following expression @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the maximum effective field of the nuclei of type @xmath82 .",
    "note that @xmath66 is inversely proportional to the electron @xmath4-factor @xmath83 . for a 2d electron system confined in a narrow gaas quantum well",
    ", @xmath84 can be considerably smaller than the bulk value @xmath85  @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated in electron spin resonance experiments that strong perpendicular magnetic fields can further decrease the magnitude of @xmath83  @xcite .",
    "polarized nuclear spins only modify the electron zeeman energy , i.e.  @xmath86 .",
    "they do not affect the orbital motion of the electrons . since the coulomb energy remains unaltered , the spin transition fields for the @xmath1 and the @xmath87 state change .",
    "let s first consider the case of the @xmath1 spin transition when the sample is mounted perpendicular to the external applied magnetic field ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "the transition field is obtained from equation @xmath89 when @xmath66 is much smaller than @xmath13 , one finds @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the transition field in the absence of nuclear spin polarization . in the limit of zero - thickness , @xmath92 , eq.([eq : btr_smallbn ] ) reduces to @xmath93    when the effect of @xmath66 , the influence of finite thickness as well as a sample tilt are all included , the calculation of the transition field is more tedious . nevertheless , a simplified treatment is possible when @xmath66 follows the curie law .",
    "the transition field is obtained by solving @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "this gives rise to a solution similar to eq.([eq : btr_finite_thickness ] ) : @xmath96 for many quantum wells of interest , @xmath83 is smaller than zero and the nuclear spins in thermal equilibrium increase the spin transition field . for a typical @xmath4-factor ( @xmath970.4 ) ,",
    "the correction due to nuclear spins is , however , rather small even at very low temperatures .",
    "for instance at @xmath98mk , @xmath99 . also noteworthy",
    "is that in the limit of zero - thickness , eq.([eq : btr_two3rds_full ] ) reduces to @xmath100 .",
    "the samples studied in this work are either single- or double - sided doped @xmath101/gaas quantum wells with thicknesses between 16 nm and 18 nm .",
    "although qualitatively similar results were observed on all samples , the data presented here were recorded on a 16 nm thick , single - sided doped quantum well with an in - situ grown @xmath102-gaas backgate .",
    "the sample was patterned into 400@xmath103 wide hall bars with voltage probes along the top and bottom perimeter that are 400@xmath103 apart .",
    "the electron density and mobility at zero backgate voltage are @xmath104@xmath105 and @xmath106@xmath107v@xmath108s , respectively .",
    "electron transport measurements were carried out in dilution refrigerators with base temperatures less than @xmath109mk .",
    "for the tilted field measurements , the samples were mounted on a stage with a low friction rotation mechanism driven by a high precision dc motor .",
    "the tilt angle @xmath41 was calibrated with low field hall measurements .",
    "standard lock - in techniques were used for the transport measurements . in order to study the current induced effects ,",
    "two currents are applied to the samples .",
    "the first is a small ac current which is typically 1na , and the other is a dc current or an ac current with different frequency from the first one .",
    "the lock - in amplifiers are locked to the first ac current , and hence they measure the differential longitudinal resistance @xmath110 and the differential hall resistance @xmath111 , which are denoted as @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively , for simplicity .",
    "the differential resistances could be considerably different from the longitudinal resistance @xmath114 and the hall resistance @xmath115 under sufficiently large bias current , but the latter are irrelevant for most of the discussion in this paper .",
    "top panel : 2d plot of @xmath112 in the ( @xmath116 ) plane with @xmath117=1na at the base temperature .",
    "regions labeled with @xmath118 and @xmath119 correspond to the incompressible @xmath120 fractional quantum hall state with spin polarization @xmath1210 and 1 , respectively .",
    "the two ground states of the @xmath122 quantum hall fluid with different spin polarizations are also shown ; bottom panel : traces of @xmath112 and @xmath113 as a function of @xmath13 with @xmath3 fixed at 2/3 .",
    "dissipative transport takes place in the phase transition region.,width=7 ]    as described in sec.[subsec : spintransition ] , the crossing of the cf levels ( 0,@xmath27 ) and ( 1,@xmath26 ) is accompanied by a transition from an unpolarized ground state with @xmath123 to a fully polarized ground state with @xmath124 .",
    "this spin transition as a result of the competition between the coulomb energy and the zeeman energy leaves a signature in a measurement of @xmath112 , since longitudinal transport becomes dissipative near the transition  @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig2_two3rd_transition ] shows an example of a transport measurement .",
    "a color rendition of the longitudinal resistance in the filling factor versus @xmath13-field plane is depicted in the top panel .",
    "arrows mark the spin orientation of the landau levels which are occupied for states with fractional fillings 2/3 and 3/5 . at filling factor 2/3",
    "the resistance becomes non - zero near 9.5 t. this is more clearly seen in a plot of the resistance along the line of constant filling factor 2/3 displayed in the bottom panel .",
    "below this field the ground state is unpolarized .",
    "also displayed in this graph is the hall resistance . at the transition the hall resistance deviates from the quantized hall resistance . at higher @xmath13-fields ,",
    "the formation of the fully spin polarized ground state gives rise to reentrant behavior in @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "as described above , the transition field @xmath24 is determined by the relative strength of @xmath38 and @xmath39 and can therefore be varied either by tilting the magnetic field  @xcite , or changing the nuclear spin polarization @xcite .",
    "conversely , a measurement of the 2/3 transition field can serve as a method for nuclear magnetometry , since the displacement of the 2/3 transition provides information on the degree of nuclear spin polarization @xcite .",
    "it follows from eq.([eq : btr_smallbn ] ) that for small nuclear fields @xmath66 , the change in @xmath66 is simply proportional to the shift of the transition along the magnetic field axis , or more specifically , @xmath127    a very useful scheme to study the interaction physics between nuclear spins and electron spins at filling factors other than 2/3 was introduced in ref  @xcite .",
    "the measurement sequence is illustrated in fig.3(a ) .",
    "it allows measuring the nuclear spin polarization at filling factor @xmath128 , the filling factor of interest . throughout this work ,",
    "@xmath128 equals @xmath2 .",
    "the system is allowed to relax and reach a steady state during an extended period of time @xmath129 at filling @xmath128 . in order to determine the degree of nuclear spin polarization at this filling factor , the magnetic field",
    "is swept in small steps in a range large enough to cover the 2/3 phase transition peak .",
    "each time after changing the magnetic field slightly , the system is again allowed to relax during a time @xmath129 .",
    "the gate voltage tracks the externally applied magnetic field to ensure that the electron system remains at @xmath128 even during the short @xmath13-field sweep .",
    "so the filling factor is at all times @xmath128 except during a short excursion period to @xmath130 ( typically a value close to 2/3 ) where we perform the nuclear magnetometry .",
    "a small ac current ( @xmath117 = 1na ) is turned on for recording @xmath112 during this excursion time @xmath131 . in this work ,",
    "@xmath129 was chosen to be 120 or 180s and @xmath131=1.5s in order to minimize the effect of nuclear spin relaxation at @xmath130 itself .",
    "it was verified that longer @xmath129 did not bring noticeable changes in the results on the nuclear spin phenomena at @xmath0 . from the magnetic field",
    "at which the spin transition peak appears the effective field @xmath132 is extracted .",
    "an important prerequisite to be able to calculate @xmath133 is the knowledge of the transition field in the absence of nuclear spin polarization .",

    "see sec.[subsec : acnucdepol ] for more details.,width=8 ]    fig.3(b ) displays @xmath125 traces recorded according to the sequence in panel a for three different temperatures .",
    "the spin transition at filling factor 2/3 , signaled by the peak in @xmath125 , moves to lower magnetic fields as @xmath134 increases .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the partially polarized fermi sea allows for efficient coupling between the nuclear and electron spin systems . at thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the nuclear spin temperature is the same as the electron temperature .",
    "cooling the electrons at @xmath0 increases the degree of nuclear spin polarization .",
    "the nuclear spin polarization acts back on the electron spins as a result of the reduced zeeman energy , i.e.  @xmath135 , with @xmath66 given in eq.[eq : bnthermal ] . for the temperatures encountered in this experiment , @xmath136 t , which is about one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath24 ,",
    "so the assumption under which eq.([eq : deltabn ] ) has been derived is satisfied .",
    "one would expect that the shift on @xmath24 follows the curie law and depends linearly on @xmath137 .",
    "the data plotted in fig.[fig3_magnetometry_two3rds](c ) , however , clearly does not follow a @xmath137 behavior .",
    "we attribute this to two factors .",
    "the resistance maximum associated with the spin transition is broad and possesses an asymmetric background as a result of thermal activation at high temperatures .",
    "this precludes us to extract precise values for the transition fields .",
    "a second problem is the difficulty in determining the electron temperature .",
    "the actual electron temperature @xmath138 may deviate from the bath temperature @xmath134 , even though the thermometer for measuring the bath temperature is mounted very close to the sample .",
    "the difference between @xmath138 and @xmath134 becomes non - negligible at temperatures lower than 45mk .",
    "this issue will be discussed in the following sections .",

    "the linear fit gives @xmath141 for the 16 nm quantum well .",
    "this is considerably different from @xmath142 expected for the 2des with zero - thickness.,width=7 ]    the results above suggest that the dependence of the maximum in the spin transition peak on the bath temperature does not provide a reliable framework to extract the nuclear spin polarization based on the 2/3 spin transition .",
    "this difficulty can , however , be overcome by measuring the transition field @xmath24 in titled magnetic fields . in this work we limited the measurements to small tilt angles so that the orbital effect of the in - plane field can be ignored . as displayed in fig.[fig4_finite_thickness](a ) , the peak of the 2/3 spin transition moves to lower perpendicular field as the tilt angle increases .",
    "the height of the peak increases considerably with tilt , but the width of the peak varies very little .",
    "this is in contrast with the temperature dependent behavior which is dominated by strong broadening at high temperatures .",
    "this feature is particularly helpful for a precise evaluation of @xmath24 .",
    "the transition field is plotted in fig.[fig4_finite_thickness](b ) as a function of @xmath64 .",
    "the experimental values of @xmath24 deviate significantly from what one would expect for a zero - thickness 2d electron system .",
    "fitting the data to eq.([eq : btr_two3rds_full ] ) yields @xmath143 t and @xmath1445.4 t .",
    "the latter corresponds to an effective width of @xmath14511 nm .",
    "it is slightly larger than the half width of the 16 nm thick quantum well .",
    "taking @xmath146 at @xmath98mk ( see sec.[subsec : nucspins ] ) , one obtains @xmath14721 t .",
    "it follows from eq.([eq : btr_smallbn ] ) that @xmath148 , significantly different from the @xmath149 expected in the limit of zero - thickness .",
    "the main effect of the small angle tilted field is that the extra zeeman energy brought by the in - plane field lowers the transition field .",
    "this is very similar to the role of thermally depolarized nuclear spins .",
    "therefore , the extra zeeman field , defined as @xmath150 , could provide a convenient route to determine @xmath151 without the need for estimating @xmath61 .",
    "an example is plotted in fig.[fig4_finite_thickness](c ) .",
    "the linear fit of the @xmath24-@xmath140 data gives @xmath152 , or equivalently @xmath141 in case that the nuclear spins are involved .",
    "the nuclear magnetometry based on the @xmath112/3 spin transition requires a rather sophisticated measurement sequence .",
    "its application is limited to a narrow magnetic field range in the vicinity of the @xmath120 spin transition only . for a 2d electron system residing in a wider quantum well , which is desirable in order to benefit from higher electron mobilities ,",
    "the 2/3 transition peak does not even show up in the transport measurement at sufficiently low @xmath134 .",
    "this makes the @xmath112/3 detection scheme no longer useful .",
    "moreover , the magnetic field sweeps during the measurement sequence raise concerns over whether the nuclear spin system is truly in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this becomes even more problematic for filling factors at which the coupling between nuclear and electron spins is weak .",
    "here we describe a new type of nuclear magnetometry .",
    "it is based on the fermi sea at @xmath0 .",
    "the degree of spin polarization of this fermi sea is also determined by @xmath153 and can therefore readily be tuned as well by either changing the nuclear spin polarization  @xcite , or by tilting the sample while keeping the perpendicular field @xmath13 fixed  @xcite . for the 16 nm thick sample used in this work , the electron system remains partially polarized up to at least 16 t if the magnetic field is not tilted . in",
