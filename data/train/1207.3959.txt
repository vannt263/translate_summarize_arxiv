    "modified theories of gravity pose a serious alternative to dark energy , an exotic cosmic fluid , needed to account for late time cosmic acceleration in the framework of standard lore@xcite .",
    "the task of building an alternative to einstein s theory is very challenging as the latter fits with the observation with a great accuracy locally thereby a large scale modification is either felt locally or the framework gets reduced to @xmath3 . a viable alternative theory of gravity should satisfy important requirements : ( 1 ) it should be close to @xmath3 but yet distinguishable from it , ( 2 ) theory should be free from ghost and tachyon instabilities and ( 3 ) theory should not conflict with local physics .",
    "the third requirement is often very stringent and its compliance needs the invoking of special mechanisms .",
    "the modified theories necessarily include additional scalar degree(s ) of freedom in some form or the other . and to be relevant to late time cosmic acceleration , it should be light mass entity which , on the other hand , could cause a havoc as a fifth force never seen in the laboratory or in the solar neighborhood .",
    "it therefore necessary to screen out the effect of the fifth force in a delicate manner .",
    "broadly , there are two methods of mass screening , the chameleon mechanism and the vainshtein effect .",
    "the chameleon scenario @xcite relies on the direct coupling of matter to scalar field with potential .",
    "the mass of the field becomes dependent on the density of environment which justifies the designation `` chameleon '' for such a field .",
    "the chameleon potential is chosen such that the effective mass of the field increases with local matter density thereby leading to suppression of fifth force .",
    "the chameleon mechanism is an extremely powerful tool for mass screening but as noticed by many authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) the numerical integration of the system for a spherically symmetric background hits singularity because of the form of the chameleon potential .",
    "hence an extreme fine - tuning of the initial conditions is required to avoid the problem .",
    "the chameleon theories are also plagued with the problem of large quantum corrections because of the large mass of the chameleon field required to pass the local gravity tests @xcite .",
    "the vainshtein mechanism @xcite is a superior field theoretic method of mass screening .",
    "it was invented by vainshtein in 1972 to address the discontinuity problem in massive gravity of pauli - fierz .",
    "it relies on non - linear derivative term of the type @xmath4 where @xmath5 is scalar degree of freedom of helicity zero graviton in this case .",
    "the dynamics of non - linear term gives rise to a miraculous phenomenon : around a massive body , in a large radius dubbed vainshtein radius , fifth force is suppressed switching off any modification to gravity locally .",
    "the field is strongly coupled to itself and hence becomes weakly coupled to matter sector .",
    "the dgp model @xcite contains such a non - linear term in the so called decoupling limit responsible for the compliance of the model with local gravity constraints @xcite .",
    "the non - standard kinetic term also occurs in kaluza - klein reduction of gauss - bonnet gravity to four dimensional space time @xcite which makes clear why the theory is free from ostrogradsky ghosts .",
    "the role of the scalar degree of freedom is played by dilaton in this case .",
    "the field @xmath5 due to the presence of an underlying symmetry in flat space time was termed as galileon . there",
    "exist higher order galileon lagrangians @xmath6 and @xmath7 that contain higher order non linear derivative terms in which four and five galileon fields participate respectively . recently",
    ", more general galileon action were constructed @xcite and their cosmological implications were investigated @xcite .",
    "they belong to a more general class of models first introduced in @xcite .",
    "the galileon field with the lower order term @xmath8 is sufficient to take care of the local gravity constraints whereas @xmath7 does not contribute to mass screening and though @xmath6 can effect the numerics of vainstein radius but adds nothing to the underlying physics of vainshtein mechanism .",
    "however , galileon system with @xmath8 term alone can not give rise to late time acceleration of universe .",
    "it was first demonstrated in @xcite that at least one higher order lagrangian , say @xmath6 @xcite be added to action in order to produce a stable de sitter solution .",
    "this is the analogue of the dgp model , where the self - accelerating branch is unstable because of the presence of ghost @xcite .",
    "also physical implications of the cubic galileon term coupled non - minimally to the metric was first studied in @xcite .",
    "since we are working in a phenomenological setting , we could restrict ourselves to @xmath8 but add a potential to galileon to produce late time cosmic acceleration .",
    "we do not assign a field theoretic mechanism to produce the potential for galileon , perhaps one would need some non - perturbative machinery to do the job .",
    "our proposal can be seen as an attempt to replace chameleon mechanism by the vainshtein effect : in chameleon scenario , the choice of specific form of chameleon potential is crucial to the model which needs to be extremely fine - tuned locally for the successful implementation of the underlying chameleon ideology .",
    "it is well known that in general theory of relativity , the newtonian and longitudinal gravitational potentials are equal provided that anisotropic stress tensor is absent .",
    "modified gravity theories usually predict a difference between these two potentials @xmath2 a gravitational slip . at the linear level of perturbations ,",
    "the modified theories of gravity give rise to an anisotropic stress tensor which is really not a signature of a particular modified theory as usually claimed . at the linear level of perturbations ,",
    "the modified theories of gravity give rise to an anisotropic stress tensor which is really not a distinctive signature of modification of gravity as usually claimed . a modified theory of gravity can ,",
    "in general , be described in terms of an imperfect fluid giving rise to a gravitational slip .",
    "thus we can not distinguish whether the slip is caused by the presence of an imperfect fluid or by the modification of gravity .",
    "since the observations , at present , do not show any difference between the gravitational potentials ( see e.g. @xcite ) , it is interesting to study models that do not produce a gravitational slip .    following the results derived in @xcite , we deduce that the most general action with second order differential equation for the metric and the scalar field which do not produce a slip is of one of the following form    @xmath9\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    or @xmath10\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 .    the two actions are different but in both cases we do not have a gravitational slip .",
    "the second action @xmath12 is a generalization of the kgb model studied in @xcite .",
    "we also note that for @xmath13 in the brans - dicke form @xmath14 , the presence of @xmath15 is important to cancel the slip between the two potentials .    keeping in mind a well motivated model which appears in the decoupling limit of dgp",
    ", we shall consider the second action hereafter .",
    "we also introduce a coupling of field to matter , therefore we work in the einstein frame where the theory does not gives rise to a slip .",
    "obviously in the jordan frame the same theory would produce a slip because of the conformal factor as noticed in @xcite .",
    "the conformal transformation would produce terms which are not in the form of the original action .",
    "the second action is the most general action free from ostrogradsky ghost problem , it does not produce a gravitational slip and contains the decoupling limit of dgp as a sub - class .",
    "but the first action can be seen as a modified brans - dicke model which can produce interesting local and cosmological solutions .    in",
    "what follows , we shall consider a simple model with @xmath16 which corresponds to the decoupling limit of dgp , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . with these choices ,",
    "our action has the form ( in einstein frame ) @xmath19\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\mathcal{s}_m\\bigl[\\psi_m;e^{2 \\beta \\phi / m_{pl } } g_{\\mu\\nu}\\bigr ] \\label{1.1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the reduced planck mass , @xmath21 is a energy scale , @xmath22 are dimensionless constants and @xmath23 is the potential for the field .",
    "+ this action corresponds to the coupled quintessence field with a galileon like correction @xmath24 .",
    "variation of the action ( [ 1.1 ] ) gives the following equations of motion @xmath25 @xmath26\\nonumber\\\\ & -v'(\\phi)=-\\frac{\\beta}{m_{\\rm{pl}}}t^{(m ) } \\label{1.3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 denotes the derivative wrt @xmath5 .",
    "in the discussion to follow , we shall investigate the cosmological dynamics and local gravity constraints in the model based upon the equations of motion ( [ 1.3 ] ) .",
    "in our model , in general , we might have both the screening mechanisms operating due to the presence of potential and the galileon term .",
    "we wish to arrange things in such a way that potential contributes negligibly to local physics giving way to vainshtein mechanism .",
    "the potential should come into action at large scales giving rise to cosmic acceleration .",
    "we now consider spherically symmetric , static solution of equation ( [ 1.3 ] ) . in flat minkowski background and in presence of non relativistic matter",
    ", we have @xmath29+\\frac{2\\alpha } { m^3r^2}\\frac{{{\\rm d}}}{{{\\rm d}}r}\\left[r\\phi'(r)^2\\right]-\\frac{{{\\rm d}}v{(\\phi)}}{{{\\rm d}}\\phi}= \\frac{\\beta}{m_{pl } } \\rho_m \\label{fifth}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we consider that the same phenomenon is at the origin of late time acceleration and local suppression of fifth force in the action .",
    "we therefore associate to both the non - linear term and the potential the same energy scale @xmath21 .",
    "we have @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "as we previously mentioned , the chameleon mechanism generates huge fine - tuning conditions .",
    "thus if we want to prefer the vainshtein mechanism , we should demand that at small scales @xmath32 \\gg \\frac{{{\\rm d}}v{(\\phi)}}{{{\\rm d}}\\phi}$ ] .",
    "then considering @xmath33 we may have a negligible potential contribution for scales @xmath34 .",
    "this scale should at least be larger that the apogee which tells us that @xmath35ev .",
    "also we should assume that the potential term is negligible compared to the matter part .",
    "considering @xmath36g@xmath37@xmath38 , we have @xmath39ev .",
    "this condition could always be verified as soon as the first one is fixed .",
    "we shall see later that for viable cosmology , the potential should be of the order of critical density which implies @xmath40ev .",
    "it seems contradictory with the previous statement .",
    "in fact , from the energy scale @xmath21 , the results will also depend on the form of the potential .",
    "we found that for inverse power law potentials , we are in the chameleon regime and hence divergences can occur .",
    "we will take up this issue in the next section where we shall consider the class of potentials in detail which give negligible contribution locally for @xmath40ev .",
    "in that case , neglecting the potential , the system reduces to the standard galileon with @xmath8 . at large scales ,",
    "the potential is dominant and this part would be studied in the next section .",
    "we note there is also an intermediate regime where the potential is of the order of @xmath8 .",
    "we would not consider the analysis of this regime here .",
    "in fact at very large distances , the approximations made in this section can not be trusted , the expansion of the universe should be taken into account too .",
    "last but not least , as there is no physical system isolated at large scales , it is not known how the screening mechanism would operate for @xmath41 particles if each one of them possess its own vainshtein radius @xmath2 the so - called _ elephant _ problem",
    ".    for the scales of interest mentioned above , the fifth force is    @xmath42 \\label{analytical}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath43 is the vainshtein radius of the body with mass @xmath21 and @xmath44 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "@xmath45    the vainshtein radius is defined as the distance from where onwards the fifth force becomes comparable with the gravitational force .",
    "considering the sun , we need a vainshtein radius larger than the size of solar system which implies that @xmath46 ev .",
    "the scale @xmath21 plays a fundamental role in local physics determined by vainshtein mechanism .",
    "this is also the scale associated with the potential thereby to the cosmology of the model . in order to get late time acceleration of the universe ,",
    "we need to fix , @xmath40 ev . on the other hand , in order to have vainshtein radius larger than the solar system , we should demand that @xmath47 . another option would be to choose @xmath48 or @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the cosmological constant .",
    "this would make the model even less natural than the cosmological constant in terms of an unnatural value .",
    "perhaps , it points towards a possibility that the scale could be linked to some large extra dimension _  la _ dgp model .",
    "finally , one could also consider two different scales @xmath51 in the model associated with the galileon term and the potential respectively .",
    "we shall not consider this possibility here .    in our analysis",
    "we have considered two different potentials    @xmath52 \\label{pot1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath53^m , \\label{pot2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 are constants and @xmath57 is a positive integer . in both cases",
    ", we found numerically that the potential is negligible locally and that the eq.([fifth ] ) can be approximated by a vanishing potential .",
    "+ the system appears as the decoupling limit of dgp and as it is well known that the vainshtein mechanisms protects the model in a static spherically symmetric configuration . in the next section",
    "we shall demonstrate that the potential is dominant at large scales and gives rise to a correct cosmology contrary to the same model without potential @xcite .",
    "all the theories described in the einstein frame by a time - varying coupling to matter leads to a variation of the effective newton constant ( @xmath58 ) as seen in the jordan frame .",
    "there are two effects which modify @xmath58 @xcite : the exchange of helicty-0 modes which is suppressed in our model because of the vainshtein mechanism and the rescaling of the coordinates because of the conformal transformation . in our case",
    "the time variation of @xmath58 occurs because of the rescaling factor only .",
    "hence it is easy to see that @xmath59 @xcite which translates into a restriction on @xmath60 , namely , @xmath61 . in the presence of a potential ,",
    "the situation is drastically modified .",
    "in fact , in this case , we can assume that the field sits at the minimum of the effective potential .",
    "as a result , in case of the potential ( [ pot1 ] ) , we have @xmath62 in the next section , we will consider cosmology for @xmath63 which means that @xmath64 .",
    "therefore we see that the llr bound will not bring additional constraints as soon as the standard cosmological constraints are satisfied .",
    "in a spatially flat flrw background , the equations of motion take the form    @xmath65    the equation of conservation which can be derived from the previous equations is @xmath66    let us introduce the following dimensionless quantities    @xmath67    needed to cast the evolution equations in the form of an autonomous system    @xmath68    where @xmath69 , @xmath70 and    @xmath71    in the case of an exponential form of the potential , @xmath72 and @xmath54 is a constant .",
    "therefore the system reduces to the set of four equations as usual .    for @xmath73",
    ", we recover the standard coupled dark - energy model @xcite .",
    "the system has the same dynamical phase plane as the coupled quintessence except one additional de - sitter solution , for @xmath74 .",
    "this solution exists only if the equation @xmath75 admits the solution @xmath76 . before getting to numerical analysis",
    ", we should broadly summarize the constraints on the model parameters .",
    "we have parameters @xmath77 in the potential ( [ pot1 ] ) which control the different phases of the dynamics .",
    "one of the parameters @xmath78 , gives rise to the radiation era whereas , @xmath79 is responsible for the late time cosmic acceleration .",
    "the matter era is principally controlled by @xmath60 . in order to have viable thermal history @xmath80",
    ", we need to impose a constraint on @xmath78 .",
    "indeed , the nucleosynthesis demands that @xmath81 during the radiation era which imposes restriction on @xmath78 , namely , @xmath82 . for stable acceleration of the universe we need to impose constraints on other parameters such that , @xmath83 and also @xmath84 . during the dark energy phase , @xmath85 .",
    "we shall make use of this information while carrying out the numerical analysis .",
    "indeed , in the numerics to follow , we will take small values for @xmath60 and adhere to @xmath86 . during the evolution ,",
    "@xmath54 would change from @xmath78 to @xmath79 hence if @xmath79 is small enough , it would imply a small variation of the potential which would give rise to quasi - de - sitter universe , @xmath87 .",
    "we have numerically analysed the autonomous system and find that the cosmology of the model is similar to the case of coupled quintessence fig.([fig1],[fig2 ] ) .",
    "the influence of the higher derivative term disappears fast with evolution leaving behind the coupled quintessence .",
    "we have not listed the various fixed points and their corresponding eigenvalues to avoid the repetition of the earlier work on the similar theme .",
    "we have plotted the dimensionless density parameter and field energy density versus the scale factor on the @xmath88 scale for the double exponential potential .",
    "the plots show in case of the overshoot a tracker behaviour .",
    "the parameters can be conveniently fixed to produce a viable late time cosmology .     of matter ,",

    "thus the non - linear term of the galileon field can alleviate constraints on the model .",
    "we have seen that the bound from the llr is weak , hence we should expect to have large values of the coupling @xmath60 . however",
