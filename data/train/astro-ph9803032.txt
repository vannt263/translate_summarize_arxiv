    "the sio molecule exhibits widespread maser emission from o - rich circumstellar envelopes ( ces ) around long period variables ( lpvs ) .",
    "the variety of rotational transitions emitted from several vibrational levels and the strength of the emission make these lines very useful for a study of the innermost layers of ces .",
    "recently , during sensitive sio observations of several o - rich late - type stars , we discovered unexpectedly broad wing sio emission ( cernicharo et al .",
    "1997 , hereafter referred as cabg ) .",
    "we found that the @xmath5 sio emission reaches and sometimes exceeds the maximum velocity traced by the quasi - thermal emission of the co molecule .",
    "several mechanisms may be invoked to explain such wings : turbulent motions , rotation of dense sio clumps , high velocity shocks produced during the pulsation of the star , or high velocity bipolar ejection of gas from the star .",
    "these mechanisms were discussed by cabg , but no firm conclusions were reached , although it was recognized that the pulsation of the star and asymmetric mass loss could play an important role . obviously interferometric observations and a monitoring of the sio wing emission are needed to shed light on the location and the physical origin of the high velocity sio emission .    the main purpose of this paper is to present and analyze new data gathered at different epochs on the sio velocity wings in order to study the physical mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon , and , at the same time , to obtain deeper insight into the complex kinematics of the circumstellar shells around late - type stars .",
    "the latter question is clearly important since it is related to other crucial problems such as the expansion of the ce and the mass loss    [ ht ]    = 15.cm    phenomenon , or the processes leading to the formation of dust .",
    "we have considered a rather small but homogeneous sample of stars as it includes miras and a few semi - regulars for which all stellar characteristics ( mass loss , temperature , spatial distribution  ) are uniformly represented .",
    "we have monitored the sio maser line profiles in order to investigate the relation of broad ( weak ) emission in wings with the stellar light phase .",
    "in particular , we wish to test whether the shocks driven by the stellar pulsation could play a dominant role in the occurrence of sio high velocity features . in sects . 2 and 3 we give details of our observations and present our main results . in sect .",
    "4 we discuss the different hypotheses which could explain the sio line wings and their location .",
    "[ t ]    our observations were carried out with the iram 30-m telescope in june 1995 and in april and october 1996 .",
    "they were combined with our earlier observations of january 1994 first presented by cabg .",
    "the sample of selected mira and semi - regular variable stars was identical for all epochs , apart from a few exceptions . the supergiant vy cma was not observed in 1995 and 1996 . in june 1995 and",
    "later , we added the mira variable @xmath6 cyg to our sample . in this work ,",
    "we have observed just one oh / ir object , oh@xmath7 , at one epoch only , june 1995 .",
    "the sample of sources discussed here is listed in the first column of table 1 .",
    "two sis receivers were used simultaneously at 86.243 and 230.538 ghz to observe the sio @xmath0 and the co @xmath8 lines . in 1995 and 1996",
    "we added a third receiver to observe the sio @xmath9 line at 129.363 ghz . to properly detect and analyze weak sio line wing signals we adjusted the side - band noise level of the receiver phase - lock loops below @xmath1035 db .",
    "the 3 , 2 and 1 mm receivers were ssb tuned and the attenuations of the image band were of order 35 and 7 db for the 3 and 2 mm sio lines , and 30 db for the co line .",
    "the best observing period was that of january 1994 ( cabg ) with low ambient temperature ( nearly @xmath11 c ) and almost no humidity .",
    "for the three other epochs the observations were made with clear sky but with relative humidity in the range @xmath12 .",
    "depending on the source elevation and on the epoch , the ssb system temperatures were in the range @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 k for the 3 , 2 and 1 mm receivers , respectively .",
    "line calibration was deduced from regular observations of a hot and cold load and from measurements of the sky emissivity . in this work",
    "the line intensities are calibrated in terms of the main beam brightness temperature .",
    "for the observations of 1995 and 1996 we adopted 0.75 and 0.58 for the telescope main beam efficiencies at the frequencies of the sio @xmath0 and @xmath16 lines , respectively . in 1994 we used 0.60 for the 3 mm observations ( cabg ) .",
    "these intensities ( in k ) can be transformed into flux densities ( in jy ) by multiplying by 4.4 at 3 and 2 mm . in general , the pointing corrections were determined by cross scanning the 3 mm maser line itself , using several filter channels as a continuum detector .",
    "the absolute pointing of the 3 mm receiver and the alignment between all receivers lay in the range @xmath17 .",
    "the focus adjustment was regularly monitored .",
    "[ t ] [ table95 ]    for spectral analysis we used analog filters with both low ( 1 mhz ) and high ( 100 khz ) resolution and the 2048-channel autocorrelator .",
    "the resolution thus achieved was 3.5 , 0.35 , 0.136 and 0.07 in sio ( @xmath18 ) , 0.18 and 2.3 in sio ( @xmath19 ) and 1.3 , 0.4 , 0.1 and 0.05 in co(@xmath18 ) .",
    "we checked that by smoothing the autocorrelator channels to a resolution similar to that given by the filterbank channels the linewidths were identical . because we searched for line wing emissions as weak as a few tens of mk flat spectral baselines are essential .",
    "all observations were thus made with the wobbling secondary mirror system .",
    "figures [ asio_spectra ] and [ bsio_spectra ] shows examples of sio @xmath5 spectra obtained in 1995 and 1996 . note that the quality of the spectral baselines facilitates the comparison of the co and sio line wings .",
    "in table 1 we present the sio @xmath5 line parameters of sources observed in june 1995 ( including oh@xmath7 at the bottom of table 1 ) .",
    "the line parameters for april and october 1996 are given in herpin ( ph.d .",
    "thesis 1998 ) .",
    "the sio and co line parameters of 1994 are given in table 1 of cabg . in column 2 of table 2 of the present work we also list the line width above the @xmath20 noise level of the co observations made in 1994 because they are used as our co reference data .",
    "although the atmosphere was less transparent at the co(@xmath21 ) line in 1995 and 1996 than in 1994 we verified that the co central velocity and linewidth remained constant with the epoch of the observations within a few @xmath22 .",
    "the sio main beam brightness temperature @xmath23 and velocity @xmath24 given in table 1 correspond to the strongest emission feature in the spectra .",
    "the sio full linewidth above the @xmath20 spectral noise level @xmath25 is also given in table 1 for june 1995 .",
    "as in cabg , our new observations show that several stars exhibit pronounced blue or red wings .",
    "this is a firm result because it is confirmed by the different backends and spectral resolutions available on the 30-m .",
    "these high velocity wings ( e.g. figs .",
    "[ asio_spectra ] and [ bsio_spectra ] ) are weak compared to the bulk of the sio @xmath5 emission whose central velocity is close to the co central velocity ; the latter gives the systemic velocity of the underlying star .",
    "we have no direct proof at the moment that the sio line wing emission is masing as are the main velocity features .",
    "we note that @xmath26 thermal lines would be very difficult to detect at these high velocities where no thermal sio emission is observed in the ground vibrational state ( cernicharo 1994 , bujarrabal 1989 ) .",
    "furthermore , in the case of r leo ( cabg ) and some other stars , the linewings are polarized .",
    "this indicates maser amplification , a fact strengthened by the line variability of the line wing emission discussed in sect .",
    "[ discussion ] .    [ t ]    to compare the velocity extent of the @xmath5 emission of sio with the co(@xmath21 ) total velocity extent we define the ratio @xmath27 where @xmath25 is the full width of the emission above the @xmath20 noise level at the epoch of the observations ; @xmath28 always refers to our 1994 observations .",
    "the values of @xmath29 are given with additional comments in table 2 for the 1994 , 1995 and 1996 results . because the co profile delineates regions of the circumstellar envelope where the gas reaches its maximum velocity whereas the sio velocities trace layers close to the photosphere , the ratio @xmath30 gives direct information on the kinematics of the inner circumstellar layers .",
    "as indicated earlier , for a given star and at each epoch , the quantity @xmath28 does not vary with time in contrast with @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath28 is unambiguously determined although in a few cases there may be contamination by interstellar co ( see cabg for discussion ) ; these cases are marked with an asterisk in table 2 .",
    "several stars have high @xmath30 values and some of them exhibit prominent red or blue sio wings , i.e. the sio velocity exceeds the thermal co velocity on the red or blue spectral end ; these cases are noted r or b in table 2 .",
    "more than one half of our sample shows a b or r sio wing .",
    "the presence of red wings in the sio spectra indicates that there is gas emission at high velocities not observed in the thermal co gas .",
    "interpretation of the sio blue wings is less straightforward because of possible self - absorption in the blue wing of the co line profile ( huggins & healy 1986 ) .",
    "therefore , the detection of sio blue wings may not necessarily mean that the ce terminal velocity is exceeded .",
    "if we restrict our sample of stars to miras only , the average value of @xmath30 is @xmath32 = 0.70 , 0.75 , 0.85 and 0.86 for the epochs 1994 , 1995 and april and october 1996 .",
    "the same quantities are systematically higher for the semi - regular variables : @xmath32 = 1.04 , 0.85 , 1.04 and 0.94 .",
    "nearly half of the observed stars have @xmath33 and 15 to 30 % have @xmath34 . on the other hand , several stars , irc@xmath35 , nml tau , tx cam , v cam , gx mon , @xmath6 cyg and r cas have small @xmath30 values .",
    "this is perhaps due to observations made roughly at the same stellar phase for nml tau , tx cam , v cam and gx mon .",
    "however , some stars have low or moderate and nearly constant @xmath30 values at all phases ( @xmath6 cyg , r cas and irc@xmath35 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath6 cyg is an s - star and therefore presents many peculiarities in the pumping of its masers ( see bujarrabal  1996 ) .",
    "some others have quite high @xmath30 values ( e.g. t cep and ru her with @xmath36 and @xmath37 in april and october 1996 , respectively ) .",
    "[ t ] [ tablephaser ]      the central velocity of the @xmath38 emission is often quite different from that of the @xmath8 emission as one would expect in gas layers with different excitation conditions . with a few exceptions , the line intensities and full linewidths above the @xmath20 noise level for the @xmath39 line are systematically smaller than for the @xmath8 line . as an example , in june 1995 we have obtained for the miras r leo and u her , @xmath23 = 19.4 and 8.1 k , @xmath25 = 13.7 and 14.3 in the @xmath16 line while we have measured @xmath23 = 50.2 and 61.3 k , @xmath25 = 15.8 and 16.4 in the @xmath40 line .",
    "examples of spectra are given in fig .",
    "[ sio32 ] . as for the @xmath8 line",
    "we define the ratio @xmath41 , and we give the individual values of this ratio in the last three columns of table 3 . if we restrict our sample of stars to miras only , the average value of @xmath42 is @xmath43 = 0.57 , 0.41 and 0.61 for the epochs 1995 , and april and october 1996 .",
    "in contrast with @xmath32 , the values of @xmath43 are not systematically higher for the semi - regular variables : @xmath43 = 0.55 , 0.68 and 0.52 for the epochs 1995 , and april and october 1996 .",
    "all values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 are lower than the corresponding values derived for the @xmath44 line ; this reflects the fact that @xmath45",
    ". nevertheless , in june 1995 and october 1996 where 20 to 30 stars where observed at 2 mm , few of them have a value of @xmath42 larger than , or of order 1 . the case of t cep",
    "is interesting as the large @xmath30 value observed at 3 mm is also observed at 2 mm ( fig . [ sio32 ] and table 2 ) .",
    "about 20% of the observed stars show a blue or red sio wing with a majority of stars exhibiting a red wing ( table 2 ) .      in table 2",
    "we compare the values of @xmath47 derived for @xmath48 at the four epochs of the observations and we derive the associated stellar phase from the most recent stellar light parameters given by the afoev .",
    "the stellar period was rather well sampled in general although additional observations would be deserved .",
    "our data show that there is a dependence of @xmath30 with the optical phase for each star .",
    "this dependence is clearly not similar for all stars in our sample . despite the fact that we only have 3 or 4 distinct epochs and that the stellar periods are unequally sampled",
    "we have searched for periodicity in our data by fitting cubic spline functions .",
    "we show six examples in fig .",
    "[ r_phase ] .",
    "[ t ]    [ t ]    in several cases @xmath47 reaches a maximum and a minimum around the optical phases @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "this maximum activity seems to occur with the same phase lag as that observed for the bulk of the sio emission ( @xmath51 in general ) .",
    "the general trend above is not always observed . in r cas or @xmath6 cyg for example",
    ", @xmath30 tends to be maximum around 0.0 , and in the case of w hya ( sra ) @xmath47 tends to remain roughly constant with time . as the amplitudes of the variations of @xmath30 are obviously different from one star to the other , and because our sample of stars is rather homogeneous ,",
    "we have normalized these values by forcing the maximum and minimum @xmath30 values for each star to 1.0 and 0.0 , respectively ; these normalized values , @xmath52 , are plotted versus the optical phase in fig.[rcorrphase ] .",
    "a global trend is obvious with a slight maximum and minimum of @xmath52 between optical phases 0.1 - 0.3 and 0.6 - 0.8 , respectively , as for the individual plots .",
    "[ ht ]    in some stars , r and , tx cam , r leo , ru her and r aql , we have observed a rapid variation in the amplitude of @xmath47 .",
    "these variations occur nearly at the same stellar phase but correspond to observations made in 1994 , 1995 and 1996 , and thus correspond to different stellar pulsation cycles .",
    "this suggests that besides the smooth variation of @xmath30 with the stellar pulsation observed in several stars , the sio wing emission may differ from one optical cycle to the other .",
    "we may thus have the combined effect of a smooth stellar pulsation with another mechanism ( of a different time order ) .",
    "this remark also applies to r leo ( fig .",
    "[ rleo ] ) for which several epochs are available although on average @xmath30 tends to be maximum and minimum around optical phases @xmath53 and @xmath54 , repectively . comparing the behaviours of @xmath30 and of the stellar visual magnitude @xmath55 with time , we note that the sudden amplitude variations of @xmath30 at a given optical phase ( as observed for example in r aql and r leo near optical phases 0.0 and 0.7 respectively ) , occur simultaneously with strong amplitude variations of @xmath55 from one stellar cycle to the other . in all cases ,",
    "the sudden increase in @xmath30 corresponds to a luminosity increase which one may relate to ir pumping of these masers .    in table 2",
    "we also give the ratio @xmath56 and the optical phase at the four epochs of our observations .",
    "the general trends observed for @xmath47 are also present in @xmath56 .",
    "however , the sio line wing intensities and extents are smaller in the @xmath16 line than in the @xmath8 line . ru her is an extreme case where the conspicuous red wing detected in october 1996 at 3 mm is not present in the 2 mm spectrum .",
    "[ ht ]    it is interesting to compare the time variation of the ratio @xmath30 with that of the sio peak intensity which is associated with the bulk of the emission ( characterized by @xmath57 and the associated central velocity ) . the sio main emission is known to vary from one stellar cycle to the other and to reach a maximum somewhat after the optical maximum ( e.g. alcolea 1993 , and martinez et al .",
    "as previously observed by other authors , we also find that @xmath58 varies with the optical phase .",
    "however , because the stellar cycle is not densely enough sampled it is impossible to conclude that @xmath30 and @xmath57 vary in phase or not , even if @xmath30 seems to present a maximum and minimum at the same phases as usually observed for the intensity .",
    "in this section we first discuss some of the mechanisms at the origin of the high velocity sio emission and whether these are consistent with the observed behaviour of the ratio @xmath29 with the light cycle .",
    "secondly , we will discuss whether our data bring some evidence or not on the question of the co - location of the sio wing emission and of the bulk of the sio emission , and on the influence of the stellar mass loss rate .",
    "various mechanisms , or a combination of these mechanisms , may be invoked to explain the high velocities observed in our sio spectra : turbulent motions , stellar pulsation , rotation or asymmetric mass loss .",
    "these mechanisms were discussed earlier by cabg , mainly they demonstrated the importance of the asymmetric mass loss while the impact of rotation was shown to be minor .",
    "in addition , the characteristic profile predicted by rotation ( e.g. two- or three - horn profile ) is not observed in our sio spectra .",
    "our new data bring information on the two first mechanisms , namely turbulent motions and stellar pulsation .      with the non - local radiative transfer code described by gonzlez - alfonso & cernicharo ( 1997 ) , cabg modeled the sio emission in an expanding envelope with low terminal velocity , high mass loss rate and strong turbulent motions .",
    "cabg succeeded in predicting blue wings and weak red wings because of shadowing and amplification of stellar emission .",
    "several stars observed in this work show indeed blue wings without a red counterpart at a given optical phase .",
    "this is observed for 7 of the 8 semi - regulars in our sample and for 4 miras . in the 4 semi - regulars s per ( src ) , r crt ( srb ) , rt vir ( srb ) and sw vir ( srb ) we have not detected any red wing at any epoch .",
    "turbulence could thus play a role in the formation of blue wings in semi - regular variables and rarely in miras .",
    "however , we did not observe that all semi - regulars and miras showed blue wing emission without red counterpart whichever optical phase we observed .",
    "this tends to prove that turbulence does not dominate , but may nevertheless contribute to the formation of the line wings .",
    "the fact that our data show for most stars in our sample a rather regular pattern for the variations of @xmath30 with the optical phase demonstrates that some connection exists between the stellar pulsation and the occurence of sio linewings .",
    "therefore , the stellar pulsation induces variations of the ratio @xmath30 with a maximum activity consistent with the 0.1 - 0.3 phase lag observed in the bulk of the sio emission with respect to the stellar flux .",
    "( in fact , the sio maser main intensity follows the ir luminosity with optical phase lags @xmath49 and @xmath50 for maxima and minima , respectively . ) several observations in r leo confirm this result .",
    "but the stellar pulsation can induce variations in the line wing emission in two different ways : directly by shocks , or indirectly by luminosity variations . concerning the shocks ,",
    "several models have attempted to predict the behaviour of the outer atmospheric gas layers in pulsating late - type variables ( e.g. bowen 1988 , wood 1989 ) .",
    "the non - linear pulsation model of wood ( 1989 ) successfully explains the velocity changes observed for the hydrogen lines in miras .",
    "the shock wave generated at each pulsation cycle is responsible for the velocity discontinuity .",
    "this is also in agreement with the ir line observations of hinkle ( 1984 ) showing both photospheric material and outwardly moving gas ( post - shock material ) , and with the results of boboltz ( 1997 ) who observed sio masers undergoing infall in r aqr . in these conditions",
    "the radial velocities may exceed the terminal velocity of the associated circumstellar envelope as this is the case for our sio observations .",
    "similar predictions are made by bowen s ( 1988 ) model where the stellar pulsation generates outflowing and infalling gas layers which could be responsible for our blue and red sio wings .",
    "velocities larger than the terminal velocity are also predicted in the innermost layers of the envelope .",
    "in fact , the outflowing gas layer running into the infalling gas creates a shock wave which locally modifies the physical conditions , and in particular increases the local density of hydrogen , making maser emission more favourable at these higher velocities .",
    "( note that this does not necessarily imply that collisions are dominant although the results of miyoshi ( 1994 ) suggest that collisional pumping plays a role for the bulk of the sio emission . ) on the other hand , if radiative pumping dominates , the observed variations of the line wing emission should correspond to maximum pumping efficiency around the optical phase 0.2 and minimum efficiency around phase 0.6 .",
    "a change by a small factor in the fully saturated peak emission may imply an enormous factor for the unsaturated wings . in conclusion",
    "stellar flux variations and shock waves are important to explain our observations and maser emission , even if it is not easy to trace shocks by studying the sio maser .",
    "shocks may explain that there is sio emission at high velocities , and radiative pumping may explain the variations of @xmath30 .",
    "the strong variations at a given phase from one cycle to another of @xmath30 , of the main emission temperature @xmath57 and of the velocity observed in r and , tx cam , ru her and r aql , as well as the changes in the sio linewing emission observed in r leo for different stellar cycles suggest that variations of the stellar physical conditions imply sudden changes in the sio wing and main line emissions .",
    "these variations can not be ascribed to changes in @xmath59 which was found to remain constant at all epochs .",
    "sudden changes are perhaps related to non - periodical stellar structure changes implying changes in the sio masing conditions . on the other hand",
    ", we can not exclude the hypothesis of an overtone stellar pulsation mode which could induce short - time variations of the physical parameters , and thus of the sio emission .",
    "rapid changes of the main and wing line emissions could also be explained by sound waves which induce local variations in the density and relative velocity just above the stellar photosphere .",
    "we thus expect sio line variations within short time scales .",
    "pijpers ( 1994 ) observed indeed in r leo and r cas variations of the intensity and velocity of the @xmath60 line over short periods of order 10 - 20 days .",
    "these sound waves could modify the sio main and wing line emissions if both emissions were co - located .",
    "interferometric observations of the sio line wings would of course be indispensable to accurately locate the red and blue line wing emissions within the circumstellar envelope .",
    "there is at least one known case , that of r leo , for which blue and red sio wings are not coexistent .",
    "this was demonstrated by the lunar occultations made by cernicharo ( 1994 ) and by the relative position measurements made with the iram interferometer ( baudry 1995 ) .",
    "we note that , in the absence of interferometric data , the observation of phase lags between the sio wing and bulk emissions could in principle indicate different spatial locations .",
    "however , in the case of variations in the radiative pumping resulting from stellar flux variations one would expect very small and thus not observable phase lags , whereas in the case of dominant shock fronts the propagation is slower , and may induce only very long - term phase lags . on the other hand , and despite our lack of more densely sampled observations , our study of the ratio @xmath30 with the stellar light cycle gives indirect evidence for similar conditions of excitation for the sio wings and the bulk of the sio emission .",
    "we have found that the maximum value of the ratio @xmath30 , namely the maximum activity in the line wings , tends to occur when the maximum activity also occurs in the bulk of the sio emission .",
    "this seems to be the general trend for most stars in our sample ( see sect .",
    "[ variability ] ) .",
    "in addition , for those stars in which we have observed sudden variations of the amplitude of @xmath30 we have observed simultaneous variations of @xmath57 and velocity .",
    "this suggests again that the main sio line emission and the sio line wings require similar pumping mechanisms , although they might not be excited in the same gas layers with similar physical conditions ( e.g. different sio column densities ) .    in order to deepen the physical meaning of the ratio @xmath29",
    ", we have plotted the values of @xmath29 obtained at the four epochs of our observations versus the stellar mass loss rate @xmath61 taken from loup et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . for both @xmath47 and @xmath56",
    ", @xmath29 decreases with increasing mass loss rate , with two notable features for @xmath30 ( fig .",
    "[ pertetotal ] ) : a sudden increase for mass loss rates around @xmath62 m@xmath63/yr , and a broad plateau where @xmath30 stays low and roughly constant for @xmath61 between @xmath64 and @xmath65 m@xmath63/yr .",
    "we note , however , that the main features in fig .",
    "[ pertetotal ] would deserve confirmation with additional data , and that the scatter present in the plot @xmath66 may also be due to uncertainties in the mass loss rates .",
    "in fact , our sample is biased because of a dependence of @xmath61 on the distance in the range 100 pc to 400 pc ( sensitivity limitation ) . nevertheless , even for the most distant stars , the detection rate of line wing emission is comparable to that for the closest stars . because @xmath59 is a good indicator of the expansion of the envelope while @xmath31 is closely related to both the excitation and the kinematics of sio we have plotted separately @xmath59 and @xmath31 versus @xmath61 for our sample stars . as expected for a species excited far in the envelope , @xmath59 increases with @xmath61 ; we also observe a flattening for the highest mass loss rates . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath31 does not clearly exhibit the general decrease observed in the plot @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , this decrease as well as the flattening observed for @xmath30 seem to be readily explained by the general behaviour of @xmath59 in our sample .",
    "these plots demonstrate that the regions of sio wing emission and co expansion are not directly related and strongly support the idea that the sio wing emission arises from the innermost circumstellar layers ( although we can not say it coexists entirely with the bulk of the sio emission ) .",
    "the apparent peak of sio wing emission observed in fig .",
    "[ pertetotal ] suggests that , to excite this emission , more favourable pumping conditions ( e.g. adequate densities ) may exist around @xmath62 m@xmath63/yr .",
    "however , we are unable at the moment to specify error bars on the mass - loss rates , and therefore the reality of the peak for the ratio @xmath30 must be confirmed by newer observations obtained for a larger sample of stars .",
    "we have observed a rather large sample of late - type stars including miras and semi - regulars with the iram 30-m radiotelescope at four epochs covering the period 1994 to 1996 in order to investigate the correlation between the sio linewing activity and the stellar light phase .",
    "the sio @xmath5 and @xmath67 lines were observed simultaneously with the co @xmath8 quasi - thermal emission line .",
    "several high velocity wings have been detected in the red and blue edges of the sio profile .",
    "the sio wing emission could result from complex mechanisms combining stellar pulsation of the fundamental mode , and perhaps of other modes , with asymmetric mass loss ( as for r leo ) and structure changes .",
    "we deduce from our observations that the time evolution of the sio line wings is related to the stellar pulsation . however , it is difficult to specify how the pulsation induces local physical variations responsible for variations of the sio wing emission .",
    "pulsation , through shocks , may produce high velocity emissions which then vary according to the optical phase .",
    "for the semi - regular variables there is some indication on the importance of turbulent motions in the formation of the high velocity emission as well .",

    "<S> we have undertaken toward 30 mira or semi - regular variables and one oh / ir object highly sensitive observations of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 transitions of sio simultaneously with observations of the @xmath2 transition of co during three observing sessions in the period 1995 to 1996 . </S>",
    "<S> as in our previous observations of 1994 , we observe that for several stars the sio profiles exhibit unusually broad wings which sometimes exceed the terminal velocity of the expanding circumstellar envelope traced by the thermal co emission . we have discovered a clear dependence of the sio wing emission on the optical phase . </S>",
    "<S> these wings are probably due to peculiar gas motions and varying physical conditions in relation with the stellar pulsation . </S>",
    "<S> however , we can not exclude other mechanisms contributing to the observed wings . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , sio turbulent motions for the semi - regular variables or the asymmetric mass loss mechanism may play a role . we conclude that the sio wing emission is due to masing processes and that this emission very likely arises from the inner part of the circumstellar envelope .    </S>",
