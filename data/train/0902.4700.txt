    "in the paper  @xcite soergel gave a combinatorial description of a certain category of harish - chandra bimodules over a simple lie algebra @xmath0 .",
    "this category was and continues to be of primary interest in the infinite - dimensional representation theory of simple lie algebras .",
    "soergel described the category anew as a full subcategory of bimodules over a certain ring @xmath1 . the objects in this subcategory are now commonly called soergel bimodules .",
    "the category of soergel bimodules is additive and monoidal , and soergel constructed an isomorphism between the grothendieck ring of his category and the integral form of the hecke algebra of the weyl group @xmath2 of @xmath0 .",
    "hence , soergel s construction provides a categorification of the hecke algebra .",
    "given a @xmath3-dimensional @xmath4-vector space @xmath5 and a generic @xmath6 , there are commuting actions of the quantum group @xmath7 and the hecke algebra @xmath8 of the symmetric group @xmath9 on @xmath10 .",
    "these actions turn the quotient @xmath11 of the quantum group and @xmath12 of the hecke algebra by the kernels of these action into a dual pair .",
    "a categorical realization of the triple @xmath13 was given by grojnowski and lusztig  @xcite via categories of perverse sheaves on products of flag and partial flag varieties , also see  @xcite .",
    "many foundational ideas about categorification were put forward by igor frenkel in the early 90 s ( a small fraction of these ideas formed a part of the paper  @xcite ) . in particular , frenkel conjectured  @xcite that quantum groups and not just their finite - dimensional quotients @xmath11 can be categorified .",
    "these conjectures remained open until recently , when categorifications of quantum @xmath14 and @xmath15 were discovered in  @xcite and  @xcite , with a related but different approach developed in  @xcite . in the categorifications",
    "@xcite of quantum groups , 2-morphisms are given by linear combinations of planar diagrams , modulo local relations .",
    "the parallel objective would be to categorify the hecke algebra in the same spirit , using planar diagrams .",
    "soergel had already provided a categorification , so it remains to ask whether his category can be rephrased diagrammatically .",
    "diagrammatics should also provide a presentation of the category by generators and relations . a similar question was recently posed by libedinsky  @xcite , who essentially produced such a description for categorifications of hecke algebras associated to `` right - angled '' coxeter systems .    here",
    "we answer this question positively in the case of the hecke algebra associated to the symmetric group .",
    "this is , of course , the hecke algebra that appears in the schur - weyl duality for @xmath16 . for notational convenience , we use @xmath17 , not @xmath18 , as our parameter and define a diagrammatical version @xmath19 of the category of soergel bimodules that categorifies the hecke algebra of the symmetric group @xmath20 .    in some sense ,",
    "diagrammatic categorifications are very `` low - tech , '' in that they can be described easily and do not rely on heavy machinery .",
    "while the proof that soergel bimodules categorify the hecke algebra is based on elaborate commutative algebra , showing that indecomposable bimodules descend to the kazhdan - lusztig basis of the hecke algebra utilizes kazhdan - lusztig theory  @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , is intrinsically linked to fundamental developments in representation theory that relate highest weight categories with d - modules on flag manifolds  @xcite , as well as the theory of perverse sheaves  @xcite and etale cohomology .",
    "one hopes that a diagrammatic approach will help to visualize and work with these sophisticated constructions .",
    "we start with an intermediate category @xmath21 whose objects are finite sequences @xmath22 of numbers between @xmath23 and @xmath18 .",
    "an object is represented graphically by marking @xmath24 points in the standard position ( say , having coordinates @xmath25 ) on the @xmath26-axis and assigning labels @xmath27 to marked points from left to right .",
    "morphisms between @xmath28 and @xmath29 are given by linear combinations ( with coefficients in a ground field @xmath30 ) of planar diagrams embedded in the strip @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "these diagrams are decorated planar graphs , where edges may extend to the boundary @xmath32 .",
    "each edge carries a label between @xmath23 and @xmath18 , so that the induced labellings of the lower and upper boundaries are @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively . in the interior of the strip , we allow    * vertices of valence 1 , * vertices of valence 3 with all 3 edges carrying the same label , * vertices of valence 4 seen as intersections of @xmath33 and @xmath34-labelled lines with @xmath35 , * vertices of valence 6 with the edge labelling @xmath36 , reading clockwise around the vertex .",
    "furthermore , boxes labelled by numbers between @xmath23 and @xmath17 are allowed to float in the regions of the graph .",
    "we impose a set of local relations on linear combinations of these diagrams , including invariance of diagrams under all isotopies .",
    "a subset of the relations says that @xmath33 is a frobenius object in the category @xmath21 .",
    "these diagrammatic generators and relations were guessed by studying generating morphisms between tensor products of basic soergel bimodules @xmath37 and writing down relations between these morphisms .    the space of morphisms in @xmath21 between @xmath28 and @xmath29 is naturally a graded vector space .",
    "allowing grading shifts and direct sums of objects , then restricting to grading - preserving morphisms , and finally passing to the karoubian closure of the category results in a graded @xmath30-linear additive monoidal category @xmath19 .",
    "our main result ( theorem [ mainthm ] in section  [ sec - conseq ] ) is an explicit equivalence between this category and the category @xmath38 of soergel bimodules .",
    "the category @xmath19 is monoidal , and can be viewed as a 2-category with a single object ( where in a diagrammatic 2-category , regions are labelled by objects , and edges by 1-morphisms ) .",
    "this may make it easier to explore similarities with the categorifications of quantum groups in  @xcite , where regions of diagrams are labelled by integers in  @xcite and integral weights of @xmath39 in  @xcite .",
    "boxes floating in regions are superficially analogous to floating bubbles of  @xcite .",
    "unlike the diagrammatic categorifications in  @xcite , our lines do nt carry dots and are not oriented .",
    "there is another way to view our diagrammatics , which is not developed in this paper .",
    "rouquier  @xcite defined an action of the coxeter braid group associated to @xmath2 on the category of complexes of soergel bimodules up to homotopies .",
    "this action was later used in an alternative construction  @xcite of a triply - graded link homology theory  @xcite categorifying the homfly - pt polynomial  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "a product soergel bimodule @xmath40 is depicted by a planar diagram given by concatening elementary planar diagrams lying in the @xmath41-plane that consist of @xmath17 strands going up , with @xmath33 and @xmath42-st strands merging and splitting , see  ( * ? ?",
    "? * figures 2,3 ) .",
    "morphisms between product bimodules can be realized by linear combinations of foams  decorated two - dimensional cw - complexes embedded in @xmath43 with suitable boundary conditions .",
    "foams have been implicit throughout papers on triply - graded link homology ( see  @xcite for instance , where various arrows between planar diagrams can be implemented by foams ) , and explicitly appear in the papers on their doubly - graded cousins , see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "foams are 3-dimensional objects  they are two - dimensional cw - complexes embedded in @xmath43 that produce cobordisms along the @xmath44-axis direction between planar objects corresponding to product soergel bimodules .",
    "the planar diagrams of our paper are two - dimensional encodings of these foams , essentially projections of the foams onto the @xmath45-plane along the @xmath26-axis .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the action of the braid group on the homotopy category of soergel bimodules extends to a ( projective ) action of the category of braid cobordisms .",
    "thus , the homotopy category of @xmath19 produces invariants of braid cobordisms , so that our planar diagrammatics carry information about four - dimensional objects .",
    "this informational density indicates efficiency of such encodings .",

    "henceforth we specialize to the case where @xmath70 and @xmath144 . here",
    "one may also define the soergel bimodule @xmath145 instead of @xmath134 , as discussed in  @xcite .",

    "thus @xmath154 are the invariants under the transposition @xmath155 .",
    "since @xmath1 is an @xmath153-algebra , @xmath156 is a bifunctor sending two @xmath1-bimodules to an @xmath1-bimodule .",
    "henceforth @xmath157 with no subscript denotes tensoring over @xmath1 , while @xmath158 denotes tensoring over the subring @xmath152 .",

    "since @xmath169 is @xmath170-invariant , it is not hard to see that @xmath171 is also @xmath170-invariant . since @xmath172 , this implies that @xmath1 is a free graded @xmath154-module of rank two , with homogeneous generators 1 and @xmath173 .",

    "we also remark on spanning sets for @xmath162 .",
    "for instance , @xmath181 has a spanning set @xmath182 where @xmath183 range over all monomials in @xmath1 .",
    "the bimodule @xmath184 for @xmath185 has a spanning set @xmath186 , over all monomials @xmath183 , since any polynomial in the middle can be slid to the left leaving at most @xmath173 behind ( or @xmath180 , which we choose when @xmath187 ) , and that can be slid to the right ; thus @xmath188 generates it as a @xmath1-bimodule .",
    "the bimodule @xmath189 has a spanning set @xmath190 , over all monomials @xmath183 .",
    "this is because all polynomials anywhere between the two @xmath33 tensors may be slid out , leaving @xmath173 somewhere in - between . as an exercise , the reader may generalize this argument to an arbitrary @xmath162 and find a spanning set as a @xmath1-bimodule , consisting of @xmath191 terms , where @xmath192 is the number of pairs @xmath193 such that @xmath194 and @xmath195 for @xmath61 between @xmath196 and @xmath197 , which is equal to @xmath24 minus the number of distinct indices in @xmath28 .    for more information on soergel bimodules and their applications",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and references therein .",
    "several subcategories of @xmath55 and @xmath56 will play a role in what follows .",
    "let @xmath198 be the full subcategory of @xmath55 whose objects consist of @xmath162 for all sequences of indices @xmath28 . since @xmath1 is a commutative ring , the hom spaces in @xmath198 are in fact enriched in @xmath56 .",

    "then , within each region delimited by the @xmath33-graph , we can reduce the @xmath42-graph ( resp .",

    "we would like to tie up a loose end and show that these auxilliary maps are actually @xmath1-bimodule maps , which would then imply that the 6-valent vertex is a bimodule map . to show this ,",
    "one should calculate where @xmath430 sends the element @xmath440 , and show that one gets the same image after moving an @xmath170-invariant polynomial between @xmath441 and @xmath442 , or @xmath443 and @xmath444 , and after moving an @xmath445-invariant polynomial between @xmath442 and @xmath443 .",
    "in fact , the algorithm for computing @xmath430 of this element is to slide @xmath442 to the left and @xmath443 to the right , leaving behind either @xmath23 or @xmath180 , and then computing the image .",

    "these facts may come in handy when constructing the analogous category for arbitrary coxeter systems .",
    "proofs of the nontrivial propositions can be found in section [ sec - proofs ] .",
    "the question which naturally arises is whether or not the colors on the boundary determine which colors can appear in the graph . for @xmath448 , ( i.e. for a coxeter subgraph of @xmath449 )",
    "we let @xmath450 be the category defined analogously but where edges can only be labelled by colors in @xmath220 . if colors which do nt appear on the boundary are not needed in the graph after reduction , then the natural inclusion of @xmath450 into @xmath21 is fully faithful , as one would expect .",
    "the case of edge colors is easy .    if @xmath33 is the lowest ( resp .",
    "highest ) color in the graph and @xmath33 does not appear in the boundary , then any graph can be reduced to a graph without that color .",
    "this follows immediately from the same proof as corollary [ cor - empty ] .",
    "any graph with only one color @xmath33 on the boundary can be reduced to a graph solely of that color .    using the above",
    ", we may eliminate all other colors .",
    "the general case is not as easy to prove graphically , but still holds true .",
    "[ prop - colorelimination ] let @xmath371 be a graph where the color @xmath34 does not appear in the boundary .",
    "then @xmath371 can be reduced to graphs not containing the color @xmath34 at all .",
    "one can prove this proposition merely by counting the dimension of hom spaces .",
    "we can think of any graph with boundary as a morphism in @xmath21 from @xmath53 to @xmath29 .",
    "we have already `` calculated '' the space of such morphisms inductively .",
    "namely , if @xmath29 has no repeated colors , then every morphism is a polynomial with boundary dots , and if @xmath29 has repeated colors , we apply biadjunction or idempotent decompositions to consider the hom space as the sum of the hom spaces of its summands .",
    "since neither biadjunction nor idempotent decompositions adds any new colors to the graph , then we know that any graph must simplify to a morphism constructed purely out of the colors on its boundary !",
    "it would be interesting to have a purely graphical proof of this result , similar to the other proofs which follow .",
    "as described in section [ subsec - sbim ] , one usually constructs soergel bimodules with respect to the @xmath18-dimensional fundamental or geometric representation , instead of the @xmath17-dimensional standard representation .",
    "this amounts to working over the ring @xmath452 / ( x_1+x_2 + \\ldots + x_{n+1 } ) $ ] , which is a quotient of @xmath1 by the first elementary symmetric function @xmath451 . since @xmath451 is symmetric , it is in the center of the category @xmath21 ( it slides freely under all lines ) , and one may easily take the quotient category , setting @xmath453 , without changing any of the diagrammatics .",
    "there is a functor from this quotient category to the appropriate category of soergel bimodules in @xmath454 , which is an equivalence of categories , so this diagrammatical quotient category also categorifies the hecke algebra .",
    "one advantage to passing to the quotient @xmath453 is that , after inverting a suitable integer , we may remove the boxes from our list of generators . according to relation ( [ doubledot ] ) , the double dot colored @xmath33 is equal to @xmath455",
    ". thus linear combinations of double dots of colors @xmath456 will give us the @xmath30-span of @xmath457 inside the space of linear polynomials .",
    "this span will not include @xmath173 in @xmath1 , which is why we require at least one box as an additional generator .",
    "however , it is easy to check that , if @xmath17 is invertible in @xmath30 , then @xmath173 is in the @xmath30-span after passing to the quotient @xmath458 . as an example , when @xmath459 , the double dot is equal to @xmath460 , and passing to @xmath461 , we get @xmath462 . thus ,",
    "if @xmath17 is invertible in @xmath30 , one can eliminate boxes from the quotient calculus altogether , replacing them with linear combinations of double dots .",
    "we need now to check that each of our relations holds true for soergel bimodules .",
    "it so happens that there are 28 relations that need to be checked independently , including color variations , and these 28 imply the remainder .",
    "these checks are completely straightforward and require little imagination . with a little imagination ,",
    "however , there are some simple tricks that make checking almost all of these relations entirely trivial .      * three polynomial slides ( [ eq - slide1])([eq - slide3 ] ) , * seven frobenius relations : 2 equalities for biadjointness ( [ biadjoint ] ) , 2 equalities twisting a trivalent vertex ( [ twistmerge ] ) , 2 equalities twisting a dot ( [ twistdot1 ] ) , and one version of associativity ( [ assoc ] ) , * three equalities for the dot and needle relations ( equality ( [ doubledot ] ) and first equalities in ( [ dotspacedot ] ) , ( [ needle ] ) ) , * two color variants of the equation ( [ eqn - threelines ] ) for the idempotent decomposition of @xmath431 and @xmath432 , * two equalities for twisting a 6-valent vertex ( either two colors , or one color in both directions ) , see equation ( [ eqn - ipipiprot ] ) , * two color variants for adding a dot to a 6-valent vertex ( equation ( [ eqn - ipipipdot ] ) ) , * two color variants of the 90 degree rotation version of double overlap associativity ( [ eqn - ipipipass ] ) , ( [ eqn - ipipipasswdot ] ) which imply the remainder of the double overlap associativity relations , * six equalities with distant strands : the r2 and r3 moves ( [ eqn - r2move ] ) , ( [ eqn - r3move ] ) , one equality for twisting a 4-valent vertex ( [ eqn - ijijrot ] ) , three equalities for pulling the distant - colored strand across a dot ( [ eqn - ijijdot ] ) , trivalent vertex ( [ eqn - pullfarthrutrivalent ] ) , and 6-valent vertex ( [ eqn - pullfarthru6valent ] ) respectively , * triple overlap associativity ( [ eqn - threecolorass ] ) .      for brevity",
    ", we will call any element which is a tensor product @xmath463 a _",
    "1-tensor_. enddot , split , and the 4-valent and 6-valent vertices all send 1-tensors to 1-tensors .",
    "this simple fact is already enough to prove relations ( [ assoc ] ) , ( [ eqn - r2move ] ) , ( [ eqn - ijijdot ] ) , ( [ eqn - pullfarthrutrivalent ] ) , and ( [ eqn - r3move ] ) , since the bottom bimodule in each of these pictures is generated by the 1-tensor .",
    "there are several choices to make when checking the various relations .",
    "once the twisting relations are shown , one is free to prove any twist of the other relations .",
    "also , we may choose which set of generators of the source bimodule to check equality on . finally , whenever a cup or a startdot appears , there are two equivalent ways to write the result , and one might be easier than the other to evaluate .",
    "an arbitrary module @xmath162 of length @xmath24 will have @xmath464 generators as an @xmath1-bimodule , where @xmath339 is the number of different colors that appear .",
    "the reason for this is that between each pair of lines labelled @xmath33 , consecutive if you ignore the other colors , a variable @xmath173 ( or alternatively @xmath180 ) might get stuck , and the number of such pairs is @xmath465 . more explicitly , @xmath162 will be generated by _ any _ @xmath464 linearly independent tensors corresponding to the power set of such pairs , where the tensor corresponding to a subset of pairs has either @xmath173 or @xmath180 somewhere between each pair ( not counting possible variables corresponding to other pairs ) .",
    "it s a mouthful , but an example clarifies it .",
    "the following is an example of a set of generators for @xmath466 :        each picture represents a tensor , where by convention a blank area is filled with a 1-tensor .",
    "reading across , the second picture corresponds to the pair of @xmath51 strands , the third to the pair of @xmath42 strands , and the fourth to the pair of @xmath33 strands .",
    "since these three are linearly independent , they take care of all the generators with a linear term . clearly the fourth picture could have also worked for the @xmath42 strands , but if we had chosen it as such , we would have had to choose a new linearly independent vector for the @xmath33 strands",
    ".    a clever choice of which generators to use may greatly simplify a calculation by reducing the number of terms in intermediate steps .",
    "there are two main instances when this occurs .",
    "either 6-valent vertex with strands @xmath33 and @xmath42 will send @xmath467 or @xmath468 to a single tensor , while it may send @xmath469 to the sum of two tensors , thus doubling the work we need to do in the remainder of the calculation .",
    "also , @xmath470 entering a 6-valent vertex @xmath431 in the second slot may by moved across the @xmath33-strand to the left for a simple calculation , while @xmath471 leads to a more complicated solution .",
    "in particular , the choice of generators above makes the verification of triple overlap associativity ( [ eqn - threecolorass ] ) rather straightforward .",
    "there is a nice graphical way of doing calculations , which we will demonstrate in perhaps the most difficult case , the highest degree generator .",
    "this graphical method is fairly self - explanatory .",
    "we keep track of the image at every stage in the calculation , which is one term as shown , with all blank spaces being filled by 1-tensors .",
    "an arrow indicates either bringing a symmetric polynomial through a line , or applying a 6-valent vertex to a tensor .",
    "we leave it as an exercise to the reader to verify , using this graphical method of calculation , that both sides of the triple overlap associativity relation , as displayed above , send the other 7 generators to the same elements .",
    "precisely , both sides send the 1-tensor to a 1-tensor , and the other generators to 1-tensors with polynomials in various slots : the 2nd and 4th generators to @xmath359 in the last slot , the third generator to @xmath474 in the last slot , the 5th to @xmath475 in the last slot , the 6th to @xmath476 in the first slot , the 7th to @xmath477 in the first slot , and the 8th as shown above to @xmath476 in the first slot and @xmath474 in the last slot .        when @xmath180 enters a merge , it is sent to @xmath300 .",
    "similar pictures can be drawn for the cap , and even simpler pictures can be drawn for the split and enddot , where no arrows are needed since 1-tensors are sent to 1-tensors . if you allow sums of such pictures , one can handle startdot and cup as well . with this method in place , checking ( [ eqn - pullfarthru6valent ] ) and both color variants of double overlap associativity using the following twist is particularly easy .",
    "choose generators so that it is always @xmath180 passed to a 6-valent vertex , and not @xmath173 or @xmath359 .",
    "when there is a cup or a startdot , this creates two terms , each of which must be evaluated separately .",
    "however , the terms can be written as @xmath478 or @xmath479 , so we may choose the one whichever is more convenient .",
    "often the problem of having two terms is very temporary .",
    "for example , consider what happens to the 1-tensor under the map        the cup creates two terms , the first with a 1 under the cap and the second with @xmath173 under the cap .",
    "but the first term is annihilated immediately by the cap , and the cap eats the @xmath173 from the other term , to return back a 1-tensor .",
    "so long as a cup or a startdot appears right next to a cap or a merge , one of the two terms is always immediately annihilated .",
    "this is the case for ( [ biadjoint ] ) , ( [ twistmerge ] ) , ( [ twistdot1 ] ) , which all send 1-tensors to 1-tensors as a result . after a quick polynomial slide ,",
    "the same is true for ( [ eqn - ijijrot ] ) , and using the more convenient choice so the @xmath180 ends up underneath the 6-valent vertex , a quick calculation shows it for ( [ eqn - ipipiprot ] ) as well .",
    "we have now given arguments or quick methods for almost all the relations .",
    "the remaining ones are trivially easy to check by hand .",
    "the rest of the one color relations can be checked on a single generator , the 1-tensor : ( [ doubledot ] ) both sides send @xmath23 to @xmath455 ; ( [ dotspacedot ] ) both sides send the 1-tensor to @xmath478 ; the needle relation , where a 1-tensor is killed by a cap .",

    "@xmath33-colored needle move is the same , except that the linear combination may also include graphs @xmath394 which are simpler than @xmath371 , but have arbitrary @xmath33-graphs .",
    "we only require use of the nonstrict versions in this paper , but we prove the strict version when it occurs .",
    "because more than three colors may be required for some proofs , we use extra line styles that designate other arbitrary colors , and are very explicit about what colors they are allowed to be . a thin line will still always represent @xmath33 and a thick line @xmath42 , but we will be lax about other colors .",
    "the only significant part of this lemma is that we can still apply the relations mentioned , even in the presence of arbitrary polynomials in each region .",
    "however , it is an immediate observation that any polynomial inside a region bounded by at least two lines of distant colors may be slid entirely out of the region , via a slide which does not affect the underlying graph .    in general",
    ", one must account for the existence of polynomials .",
    "for instance , the relation ( [ eqn - threelines ] ) does not immediately imply that we can apply the graph reduction which sends two 6-valent vertices to a combination of the lines and the `` h '' with dots , since the composition of the two 6-valent vertices might have @xmath173 in an internal region , which can not be slid out .",
    "one can still effectively move a polynomial from one side of a line to the other , using relation ( [ dotspacedot ] ) , but this leaves an extra term where the line is replaced by a pair of dots .",
    "suppose the @xmath33-graph of @xmath371 contains two dots connected by an edge .",
    "then in @xmath371 , the `` edge '' connecting them can only be a series of 4-valent vertices with various @xmath34-strands for @xmath34 distant from @xmath33 .",
    "since dots can be slid across distant - colored strands by ( [ eqn - ijijdot ] ) , we may slide the dots until they are connected directly by an edge , and just use ( [ doubledot ] ) to reduce the graph .",
    "suppose the @xmath33-graph of @xmath371 contains a trivalent vertex connected to a dot .",
    "in @xmath371 , the trivalent vertex is either a trivalent or 6-valent vertex @xmath234 .",
    "again , in @xmath371 the dot may be slid across distant - colored strands until it is connected directly to @xmath234 .",
    "if @xmath234 is trivalent then isotopy allows us to contract the dot , while if @xmath234 is 6-valent , ( [ eqn - ipipipdot ] ) sends @xmath371 to the sum of two simpler graphs ( note : one is the graph after dot contraction , but one is not , so we can not necessarily apply the strict dot contraction move ! ) .",
    "let @xmath371 be a sequence of lines @xmath29 , such that @xmath33 does not appear .",
    "then @xmath371 is equal in @xmath21 to a sum of idempotents , such that each idempotent factors through a sequence of lines @xmath48 where @xmath51 and @xmath42 each appear no more than once , and such that the idempotents do not introduce any new colors not present in @xmath29 .",
    "this proof is akin to the combinatorial argument that the relations defining the hecke algebra or the symmetric algebra are enough to take any complicated word in @xmath486 or @xmath487 to a reduced form .",
    "we use induction on the length of @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath488 appears in @xmath29 for some @xmath3 , then using ( [ eqn - threelines ] ) , we may factor through @xmath489 instead , modulo morphisms that factor through shorter length sequences .",
    "if any color appears twice consecutively in @xmath29 then we may apply ( [ twolines ] ) to replace the two adjacent lines with an `` h '' , which factors through a sequence of lines of shorter length .",
    "if @xmath490 appears for @xmath34 distant from @xmath3 , then applying the r2 move we can factor through @xmath491 .",
    "none of these procedures added any new colors .",
    "so if we consider the sequence @xmath29 as a word in the symmetric group @xmath492 , then any non - reduced words will reduce to smaller length sequences , and any two reduced words for the same element will factor through each other , modulo smaller length sequences .",
    "we may now use the easily observable fact that any element of the symmetric group can be represented by a reduced word which uses @xmath493 at most once , or @xmath494 at most once ( although not both ! ) .",
    "the obvious corollary is that any element of the symmetric group which has a reduced word presentation that does nt use @xmath170 , can be given a reduced word presentation which uses @xmath495 and @xmath445 at most once ( since all @xmath487 for @xmath496 commute with all @xmath497 for @xmath498 , we can view the @xmath497 as forming a word in @xmath499 , and the @xmath487 as forming a word in @xmath500 ) .",
    "assume @xmath51 does not appear , although the @xmath42 case is analogous .",

    "in fact , in some neighborhood @xmath384 is just a sequence of lines , and by the earlier lemma , we get a sum of graphs where , in a smaller neighborhood , this sequence contains at most a single @xmath42 strand ( and no @xmath51 strands ) . for each term , apply the r2 move to bring the @xmath33-strands past all the other colors so that they are separated by either nothing or a single @xmath42 strand .",

    "consider each term in the sum : @xmath33 is distant from every color appearing in the idempotent , so one can slide the @xmath33-strand past every morphism in the idempotent until it runs through the nice sequence of lines , and the rest of the idempotent is now outside of some smaller neighborhood of the @xmath33-strand in the new graph .",

    "both propositions hold when @xmath33 is the only color in the graph , by ( [ eqn - associativity ] ) , ( [ needle ] ) , polynomial slides , and ( [ needlewitheye ] ) , where the latter is needed because an arbitrary polynomial may be within the eye of the needle .",
    "the inductive hypothesis then implies , with the previous propositions , that for any graph with fewer colors , we may apply _ all _ the basic @xmath3-colored moves , when the graph does not contain either @xmath504 or @xmath505 . in this case proposition [ prop - onecolor ]",
    "says that we may reduce the @xmath3-graph to a simple tree or forest . within each region of @xmath371 delineated by the @xmath33-graph",
    "the color @xmath33 is absent , so there are fewer total colors and we may reduce both the @xmath51-graph and the @xmath42-graph inside this region to a simple tree .      so suppose the @xmath33-colored graph contains a needle .",
    "the trivalent vertex of the needle is either trivalent or 6-valent in @xmath371 , and the edge of the needle may contain a series of 4-valent vertices .",
    "so a neighborhood of the needle in @xmath371 looks like one of the pictures below .",
    "we may now reduce the @xmath42 and @xmath51 graph of @xmath384 , since @xmath384 does not contain the color @xmath33 . in the first case , the @xmath506 graph has no boundary , so both reduce to the empty graph . in the second case ,",
    "one of the two has a single boundary line , and the other has none , so one graph reduces to the empty graph , and the other to a single dot . within the reduced @xmath384 , this dot",
    "may be slid under other lines until it is a boundary dot , as in the proof of the earlier dot move propositions .",
