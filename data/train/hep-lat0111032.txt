    "high density state of the strongly interacting matter is a very attracting problem in the connection to the recent experiments of the relativistic heavy ion collider at bnl @xcite .",
    "physics of extremely high density state is also important for the understanding the astrophysical objects such as neutron star .",
    "usually in the statistical physics , high density state is investigated with use of the ground canonical ensemble with chemical potential which is introduced as a lagrange multiplier for the conserved charge .",
    "however , as is well known , chemical potential makes action of the qcd complex and causes a problem in the numerical convergence of simulation based on the monte calro method @xcite .",
    "su(2 ) gauge theory is the simplest non - abelian gauge theory and holds the pseud - real property which keeps action real even with chemical potential . though the real qcd is not su(2 ) but su(3 ) , su(2 ) gauge theory is expected to play an role as a qcd - like theory which informs us important features of the non - abelian field theory @xcite .",
    "su(2 ) gauge theory as a residual interaction in the color super conducting state is also one of the promising possibility and the high density state of su(2 ) gauge theory can be realized @xcite .",
    "we calculate thermodynamical quantities as functions of chemical potential .",
    "ground canonical ensemble states are generated through update based on the woodbery formula @xcite .",
    "iwasaki improved action is adopted for the gauge action .",
    "though the improved action seems to stabilize the simulation better than the naive wilson action @xcite , our simulation still shows instability at around @xmath6 .",
    "however , the susceptibility of the polyakov line @xmath7 shows peak at around @xmath5 which suggests the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "therefore , our simulation can correspond to the state around across the phase transition .",
    "with use of wilson fermions and iwasaki improved action we calculate thermodynamical quantities , such as polyakov line , gluon energy density and baryon number density with @xmath4 lattice .",
    "the expectation value of the baryon number density is given by , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the spatial volume @xmath10 .",
    "energy density , @xmath11 , is given as , @xmath12 the derivative of the partition function is composed of two parts , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are gluon action and fermion action , respectively .",
    "we denote the contribution of the gluon action part ( first term in the r.h.s . of eq.(3 ) ) by gluon energy density .",
    "figure 1 displays polyakov line , gluon energy density and baryon number density as functions of @xmath3 where @xmath16 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "all quantities start to have non - zero value at about @xmath17 and rise up with chemical potential in the region @xmath18 .",
    "none of them is order parameter of the phase transition in the exact sense , and since the lattice size is small , no sharp change is seen .",
    "however , growing up of the these quantities indicates that quarks and gluons become free from the confinement force at finite chemical potential about @xmath18 .",
    "figure 2 shows susceptibility of the polyakov line as the functions of the chemical potential @xmath3 .",
    "the peak appears at around @xmath19 which suggests that our simulation crosses the deconfinement phase transition",
    ". however , peak point seems to depend on the hopping parameter @xmath20 .",
    "larger hopping parameter seems to give lower phase transition @xmath21 .",
    "figure 3 shows our preliminary results of the propagator of mesons and diquarks with @xmath2 . in the lower figure , at @xmath22 , pion and scalar diquark(b5b ) , and a0 and pseudscalar diquark(b1b ) are degenerate each other , as expected .",
    "however , such degeneration of meson and diquark disappears with finite chemical potential . because diquark possesses definite baryon number , the effect of the chemical potential on diquark and anti - diquark are in the opposite sign .",
    "therefore , the symmetry of the propagator in time direction and anti - time direction is broken and asymmetry in nt appears(b1b and b5b in the lower figure of fig.3 ) .",
    "on the other hand , mesons , which have vanishing baryon number , keep symmetric property in nt direction @xcite . according to figure 2 , @xmath23 with @xmath2",
    "is in the region upper side than the peak point .    . the upper figure and lower figure stands for the @xmath23 and @xmath22 , respectively",
    "if we look upon the peak in figure 2 as the deconfinement phase transition point , those figures correspond to the mesons diquarks in the state over and under the phase transition ]",
    "su(2 ) finite density state is investigated with wilson fermion and iwasaki improved action .",
    "peak of the susceptibility appears at around @xmath5 , but it seems to depend on the @xmath20 .",
    "it means physical size of the lattice spacing will change with @xmath20 and careful treatment will be required in the procedure of the chiral limit .",
    "the propagators of the mesons and diquark state ( baryon in su(2 ) ) have also discussed @xcite .",
    "detailed analyses for both meson and diquark will appear somewhere else .",
