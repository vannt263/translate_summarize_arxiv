    "the present interest in a combined study of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson production in different elementary reactions is mainly related to the investigation of the hidden strangeness degrees of freedom in the nucleon .",
    "since the @xmath1 meson is thought to consist mainly of strange quarks , its production should be suppressed according to the ozi rule @xcite if the entrance channel does not possess a considerable admixture of strangeness .",
    "the standard ozi rule violation is described by the deviation from the ideal @xmath3 mixing by the angle @xmath8 @xcite , which is a measure of the small contribution of light @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks in the @xmath1 meson , or strange @xmath11 quarks in the @xmath0 meson .",
    "thus , the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath1 production cross sections is expected to be @xmath12 .    indeed , the recent experiments on the proton annihilation at rest ( cf .",
    "@xcite for references and a compilation of data ) point to a large apparent violation of the ozi rule , which is interpreted @xcite as a hint to an intrinsic @xmath13 component in the proton .",
    "however , the data can be explained as well by modified meson exchange models @xcite without introducing any strangeness component in the nucleon or ozi rule violation mechanisms .    on the other hand",
    ", the analysis of the @xmath2 sigma term @xcite suggests that the proton might contain a strange quark admixture as large as 20% .",
    "thus this issue remains controversial .",
    "therefore it is tempting to look for other observables @xcite that are sensitive to the strangeness content of the nucleon .",
    "most of them are related to a possible strong interference of delicate @xmath14 knock - out ( or shake - off ) amplitudes and the `` non - strange '' amplitude which is caused by ozi rule allowed processes , or by processes wherein the standard ozi rule violation comes from the @xmath15 mixing .",
    "a detailed analysis of the current status of the ozi rule in @xmath2 and @xmath16 reactions has been presented recently in @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that existing data for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson production in @xmath2 reactions give for the ratio of averaged amplitudes the value of @xmath17 , which is much smaller than the standard ozi rule violation value of @xmath18 and may be interpreted as a hint to non - zero strangeness components in the nucleon .",
    "obviously , reliable information on a manifestation of hidden strangeness in the combined study of @xmath1 and @xmath0 production processes can be obtained only when the conventional , i.e. non - exotic , amplitudes have been understood quantitatively .",
    "the reaction @xmath19 with @xmath20 , @xmath1 has the evident advantage to be a simple hadronic reaction representing a subprocess , e.g. , in @xmath21 reactions .",
    "the study of the former reactions is one of the objectives of the present work .",
    "the dominant conventional processes are depicted in fig .  1 , where ( a ) is the @xmath4 channel meson exchange process , while ( b ) depicts the @xmath5 , @xmath6 nucleon and nucleon resonance channels .",
    "when taking separately each of the amplitudes , the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath1 production amplitudes is proportional to @xmath22 and the question arises how their coherent sum can result in a deviation from this value .    note that most of the previous considerations of the possible violation of the ozi rule in hadronic reactions are based on one - channel models in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "but if one assumes that the process is a coherent sum of at least two amplitudes , say for example , a meson exchange and a nucleon term , then the result may be different from the naive expectation .",
    "indeed , let us suppose for a moment that , because of some hadronic dynamics , the nucleon term for the @xmath1 production is suppressed relative to the meson exchange term",
    ". then the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath1 amplitudes becomes @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the ratios of nucleon and meson exchange amplitudes .",
    "thus , one can get immediately an enhancement ( suppression ) of @xmath25 , as compared to the ozi rule prediction , for a constructive ( destructive ) interference between the two @xmath0 amplitudes and for @xmath26 .",
    "our previous study @xcite of @xmath1 production shows that the interference between meson exchange and nucleon terms is destructive .",
    "assuming the same for @xmath0 production , @xmath27 must decrease , even without any speculation on a strangeness content in the nucleon . in case of considering the @xmath0 production , however , this two - channel model is by no means longer adequate , because one has to include various strong resonance channels .",
    "the ratio @xmath28 becomes complex which may change the above estimates in any direction .",
    "the resonance contribution to vector meson production has its own interest because it might affect significantly in - medium polarization operators and the corresponding dilepton emissivity of hadronic matter @xcite .",
    "therefore its detailed study in elementary @xmath2 processes is another objective of the present work .",
    "an important step in this direction has been done recently by riska and brown in @xcite , where the relevant @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 coupling constants are expressed in terms of the corresponding couplings to nucleons using a quark model .",
    "our study here exploits essentially the findings of @xcite .",
    "the role of the low - lying nucleon resonances in a combined study of @xmath32 and @xmath0 production based on the relativistic coupled - channel model has been studied in refs .",
    "some aspects of the @xmath33 meson spectral function in the nucleon resonance model have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the higher resonances to the @xmath0 photo - production has been analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our analysis of the reaction @xmath19 is based on calculations of the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . while the diagrams in fig .  1",
    "look like usual feynman diagrams it should be stressed that they give a guidance of how to obtain from an interaction lagrangian of hadronic fields a covariant parameterization of observables in strict tree level approximation .",
    "additional ingredients are needed to achieve an accurate description of data within such a framework .",
    "in particular , the vertices needs to be dressed by form factors .",
    "the early theoretical studies  @xcite show , indeed , that predictions for hadronic observables are very sensitive to the parameters of the form factors which can not be fixed unambiguously without adjustments relying on the corresponding experimental data .",

    "a good description of available data has been achieved .",
    "we did not consider in @xcite the @xmath0 production for which the production mechanism is more complicated because of the resonance contributions shown in fig .",
    "therefore , the problem of the validity of the ozi rule was beyond the scope of considerations in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we attempt a different approach with the goal to check the validity of the ozi rule in a combined study of the related reactions @xmath39 and @xmath40 using the known data within the same interval of excess energies @xmath41 mev and taking into account the nucleon resonance channels .    our paper is organized as follows . in section ii , we define the effective lagrangians , derive expressions for the amplitudes of the processes shown in fig .  1 and discuss the parameter fixing . in section iii the results of numerical calculations and predictions are presented .",

    "indeed , the calculation in @xcite , within the vector dominance model , shows that the @xmath223 coupling for @xmath222 is about four times smaller than for the @xmath224 resonance . observing further that the corresponding pion decay width of @xmath222 , 5@xmath22515 mev , is much smaller than that of @xmath224 , 210@xmath225250 mev",
    ", we can expect a negligible contribution of @xmath222 being about one order of magnitude smaller than the one of @xmath224 .",

    "one can see that the destructive interference between meson exchange and nucleon channels , which is stronger for backward production , results in a non - monotonic angular distribution . the effect is stronger at @xmath228 mev .",

    "that is because at the threshold @xmath235 where @xmath236 is a smooth function of @xmath237 .",
    "the ratio for pure resonance terms is greater than @xmath234 by an order of magnitude and more , i.e. , @xmath238 at @xmath239 , because of a strong propagator and form factor suppression for @xmath1 production . in the absence of the resonant amplitude",
    "the destructive interference of meson exchange ( m ) and nucleon ( n ) channels results in @xmath240 .",
    "the presence of the resonance components leads to @xmath241 .",

    "8 shows the results of our full calculation of the spin density matrix element @xmath67 at @xmath214 and 100 mev in the left and right panels , respectively . near the threshold the meson exchange amplitude behaves as @xmath245 .",
    "\\label{tm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that means that only @xmath246 contributes and , therefore , @xmath67 is suppressed .",
    "the pure nucleon @xmath5 channel amplitude behaves as @xmath247 which results in an isotropic spin density , i.e. , @xmath248 .",
    "the resonance amplitudes have additional terms proportional to @xmath249 , which also enhance @xmath67 .",
    "this effect is seen clearly in the left panel of fig .",
    "8 for which our qualitative analysis is valid . for @xmath1 production , where the main contribution comes from the meson exchange channel ( cf",
    ".  figs .  2 and 5 ) , @xmath67 is relatively small , @xmath250 . but",
    "for @xmath0 production , where the contribution of the resonance channel is essential , we find @xmath251 which is close to an isotropic spin - density distribution with @xmath252 .",
    "9 shows the angular distribution of hadronic decays @xmath253 and @xmath59 in @xmath254 reactions at @xmath214 mev .",
    "the left panel corresponds to a calculation of the vector meson production in forward direction , @xmath255 , where the cross section achieves a maximum , while the right panel shows its average value in the full angular interval @xmath256 .",
    "one can see a striking difference between the @xmath1 and @xmath0 cases : an almost anisotropic distribution for @xmath1 production ( @xmath257 ) and almost isotropic distribution for @xmath0 production ( @xmath258 ) , respectively , which reflect the difference in the corresponding production mechanisms .",
    "a similar difference is predicted for the angular distribution of electrons in @xmath259 reactions shown in figs .",
    "10 and 11 at @xmath214 and 100 mev , respectively .",
    "again one can see that at @xmath226 mev ( fig .",
    "10 ) the @xmath1 and @xmath0 cases are very different : an almost anisotropic distribution for @xmath1 production ( @xmath260 ) , and almost isotropic distribution for @xmath0 production ( @xmath261 ) , respectively .",
    "this pronounced difference disappears at @xmath228 mev ( fig .",
    "it should be emphasized that our prediction for the separate decay @xmath262 may be tested experimentally supposed the corresponding detector acceptance is sufficiently large for distinguishing the sharp @xmath0 resonance peak in the dielectron invariant mass distribution sitting on the background of the wide @xmath32 meson contribution .",
    "otherwise one should consider the @xmath263 interference as calculated for unpolarized observables in @xcite .",
    "however , having in mind that the @xmath32 production is a competing channel to the @xmath0 production , where the role of the resonances is expected to be even more important because of the larger number of intermediate @xmath264 states , we expect that our prediction of an almost isotropic @xmath265 distribution at invariant mass @xmath266 remains valid in general , reflecting the role of the baryon resonances in the production mechanism .",
    "in summary we have performed a combined analysis of @xmath0 and @xmath1 production in @xmath2 reactions near the threshold at the same energy excess .",
    "we find that the meson - exchange amplitude alone can not describe the existing data , rather the role of the direct nucleon term and the nucleon resonance amplitudes is essential .",
    "the latter statement is very important for the @xmath0 production , and therefore we investigate the role of nucleon resonances in detail .",
    "the @xmath223 couplings as well as the phases of the @xmath267 couplings are taken from the recent work @xcite .",
    "it is found that the resonance contributions can influence significantly the total and the differential cross sections at small energy excess as well as the ratio of the averaged amplitudes of @xmath0 and @xmath1 production .",
    "for this ratio we get the value @xmath268 which is much smaller than the value based on the standard ozi rule violation .",
    "the dominant contributions are found to stem from the nucleon resonances @xmath269 , @xmath270 , and @xmath224 .",
    "however , the other resonances become also important with increasing energy excess .",
    "we have shown that our predictions can essentially be tested by measuring the angular distribution of decay particles in the reactions @xmath271 , @xmath272 and @xmath273 .",
    "near the thresholds , for the @xmath1 production we predict an almost anisotropic distribution , while for the @xmath0 production an almost isotropic distributions is obtained .",
    "experimentally , this prediction can be tested with the pion beam at the hades spectrometer at gsi / darmstadt @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that the present investigation is completely based on the conventional meson - nucleon dynamics and , therefore , our predictions may be considered as a necessary background for forthcoming studies of the hidden strangeness degrees of freedom in non - strange hadrons .",
    "finally , it should be emphasized that our study here is a first step from the point of view of a dynamical treatment of the problem , thus going beyond @xcite .",
    "the main uncertain part is the poor knowledge of the strong cut - off factors for the virtual nucleon and nucleon resonances which are important for the present consideration .",
    "also , the effects of the final state interaction must be investigated which may be pursued by extending the approach of refs .",
