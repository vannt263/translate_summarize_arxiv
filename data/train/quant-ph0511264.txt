    "in many proposed implementations of a quantum computer ( qc ) single - qubit operations are performed by applying pulses of radiation .",
    "the pulses cause resonant transitions between qubit states , that is between the states of the system that comprises a qubit .",
    "the operation is determined by the pulse amplitude and duration . in many proposals , particularly in the proposed scalable condensed - matter based systems @xcite ,",
    "control pulses will be applied globally , to many qubits at a time .",
    "a target qubit is chosen by tuning it in resonance with the radiation .",
    "the corresponding gate operations invariably involve errors which come from the underlying errors in the frequency , amplitude , and length of the radiation pulse as well as in the qubit tuning .",
    "improving the accuracy of quantum gates and reducing their sensitivity to errors from different sources is critical for a successful operation of a qc .",
    "much progress has been made recently in this direction by using radiation pulses of special shape and composite radiation pulses @xcite . in the analysis or resonant pulse shape",
    "it is usually assumed that the qubit transition frequency is held constant during the pulse .",
    "an alternative approach to single - qubit operations is based on landau - zener tunneling ( lzt ) @xcite . in this approach",
    "the qubit transition frequency @xmath0 is swept through the frequency of the resonant field @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the change of the qubit state depends on the field strength and the speed at which @xmath0 is changed when it goes through resonance @xcite .",
    "the lzt can be used also for a two - qubit operation in which qubit frequencies are swept past each other leading to excitation swap @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study the robustness of the lzt - based gate operations .",
    "we develop a simple pulse sequence that is extremely stable against errors in the qubit transition frequency or equivalently , the radiation frequency .",
    "such errors come from various sources .",
    "an example is provided by systems where the qubit - qubit interaction is not turned off , and therefore the transition energy of a qubit depends on the state of other qubits .",
    "much effort has been put into developing means for correcting them using active control @xcite .",
    "an advantageous feature of lzt is that the change of the qubit state populations depends on the radiation amplitude and the speed of the transition frequency change @xmath2 , but not on the exact instant of time when the frequency coincides with the radiation frequency , @xmath3 .",
    "however , the change of the phase difference between the states depends on this time .",
    "therefore an error in @xmath4 or @xmath1 leads to an error in the phase difference , i.e. , a phase error .",
    "this error has two parts : one comes from the phase accumulation before crossing the resonant frequency , and the other after the crossing .",
    "clearly , they have opposite signs .",
    "a natural way of reducing a phase error is to make the system accumulate the appropriate opposite in sign phases before and after the  working \" pulse . to do this",
    ", we first apply a strong radiation pulse that swaps the states , which can be done with exponentially high efficiency using lzt .",
    "then we apply the  working \" pulse , and then another swapping pulse .",
    "the swapping pulses effectively change the sign of the accumulated phase .",
    "as we show , by adjusting their parameters we can compensate phase errors with a high precision .    in sec .",
