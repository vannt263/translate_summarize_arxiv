    "inspection of circular current in low - dimensional conducting loops driven by magnetic flux @xmath0 has remained alive over past few decades since its prediction  @xcite in @xmath3 by bttiker _",
    "_ it is well known that an isolated conducting mesoscopic ring , threaded by an aharonov - bohm ( ab ) flux @xmath0 carries a net circulating current , the so - called _ persistent current _  @xcite , which never decays with time . to achieve this non - vanishing circular current the prerequisites",
    "are  @xcite : ( i ) system size should be finite and not too large and ( ii ) temperature ( @xmath4 ) of the system should be low enough . actually these two i.e. , system size and temperature are interdependent in the sense that the average energy level spacing @xmath5 must be greater than @xmath6 ( @xmath7 being the boltzmann constant ) to obtain non - decaying circular current .",
    "with increasing system size @xmath5 decreases which recommends low temperature limit , while for smaller systems non - zero circular current can be obtained even for a higher temperature region as for these systems @xmath5 becomes sufficiently large .    following the pioneering work done by bttiker and his co - workers ,",
    "many theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite groups have carried out systematic studies to explore interesting characteristic features of circular currents considering different loop geometries . in most of these cases simple ring - like conductors or array of rings or cylindrical conductors",
    "have been considered .",
    "along with these few other geometries  @xcite have also been taken into account to explore interesting patterns of circular current in presence of aharonov - bohm flux @xmath0 . in these works ,",
    "persistent currents have been described in aspects of electron filling @xmath8 , chemical potential @xmath9 of the system , temperature @xmath4 , electron - electron correlation @xmath10 , electron - phonon interaction and to name a few .",
    "but , to the best of our knowledge , no one has addressed the issue of conformation dependent circular current so far . in the present work we essentially focus on that particular issue by considering a single handed helical geometry ( fig .  [ helix ] ) .",
    "the helical model is illustrated by a set of non - planar rings those are connected by some vertical bonds .",
    "each of these rings is formed by introducing a finite coupling between the atomic sites @xmath1 and @xmath2 as shown in fig .",
    "[ helix ] .",
    "the helical conductor exhibits a net circulating current in presence of ab flux @xmath0 passing through centers of the rings .",
    "the main motivation behind this work    is two - fold .",
    "( i ) to investigate the interplay between conformational change and hubbard correlation , which is still unaddressed , on circular current in a helical geometry .",
    "( ii ) the helical geometry has recently become truly significant in understanding electron transport in several bio - molecules  @xcite .",
    "studying the behavior of circular current in presence of ab flux , conducting nature of such helical - like geometries can be estimated up to a certain level .",
    "we strongly believe that the present investigation may be helpful in analyzing magnetotransport in several real as well as artificially designed bio - molecules  @xcite .    using a tight - binding ( tb ) framework we describe the model and compute all the numerical results within a hartree - fock ( hf ) mean field level  @xcite .",
    "the results are impressive .",
    "( i ) by stretching and compressing the helical geometry we can control persistent current , keeping all the other physical parameters unchanged .",
    "this is quite different from the conventional cases , where current amplitude is regulated either by changing disorderness or by means of electron filling or something else .",
    "thus , our system can be exploited to design conformation dependent current controlled device at the nano - scale level .",
    "( ii ) the other important observation is that the geometry exhibits both @xmath11 and @xmath12 periodic persistent currents , while conventional ab rings provide only @xmath12 periodic currents .",
    "the rest of the work is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we illustrate the model and give a detailed theoretical description to calculate circulating current within a hartree - fock mf approach . the results are analyzed in section iii which includes the effects of compression and extension of the conductor , hubbard correlation , electron filling , etc . finally , in section iv we summarize our findings and present the future perspective .",
    "let us begin by referring to fig .  [ helix ] where a single handed helical conductor in presence of magnetic flux @xmath0 ,    measured in unit of the elementary flux - quantum @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , is given .",
    "here we consider three different cases , viz , stretched , undeformed and compressed , of the conductor depending on its configuration to explore conformation dependent magnetotransport properties .",
    "these configurations are schematically shown in figs .",
    "[ combined](a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively , where the conformational change is described by increasing and/or decreasing the ring size and chain length such that the total number of atomic sites @xmath14 of the helical conductor is fixed .",
    "it is written as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 corresponds to the total number of rings in which each ring contains @xmath17 atomic sites .",
    "the wire is divided into three parts .",
    "one is called intermediate wire that connects two adjacent rings and the other two are called outer wires .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 represents total number of intermediate wires in the conductor where each of these wires holds @xmath19 atomic sites , while @xmath20 and @xmath21 give the atomic sites in the two outer wires , respectively .",
    "the tb hamiltonian of such a helical conductor can be written as a sum of four terms like @xmath22 , where they correspond to four different regions of the interacting conductor .",
    "these terms are described as follows .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 describes identical rings , and , for any such rings it becomes , @xmath26 \\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\lambda \\sum_{\\sigma } \\left[e^{i\\theta } c_{n_r\\sigma}^{r\\dagger }   c_{1\\sigma}^r + h.c .",

    "@xmath34 represents the nearest - neighbor hopping integral and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) is the phase factor associated with magnetic flux @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath37 measures non - zero hopping between the atomic sites @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "[ helix ] ) due to their close proximity and @xmath10 gives the on - site coulomb interaction .    in a similar fashion",
    "we express @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) which describes the hamiltonian of all inner wires , and for any such wires it gets the form , @xmath40 \\nonumber \\\\   & & + u \\sum_{i=1}^{n_w^{\\mbox{\\tiny in } } } c_{i\\uparrow}^{w\\dagger } c_{i\\uparrow}^w c_{i\\downarrow}^{w\\dagger } c_{i\\downarrow}^w . \\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath41 corresponds to the nearest - neighbor hopping integral and other parameters carry similar meaning like above .",
    "finally , to describe tb hamiltonians @xmath42 and @xmath43 for the two outer arms we use exactly similar kind of tb hamiltonian as given in eq .  [ eq2 ] , except that in one case @xmath19 is replaced by @xmath20 , while in the other case @xmath19 is substituted by @xmath21 .",
    "both these outer and inner wires are coupled to the rings via the same hopping integral @xmath41 .",
    "this is the complete description of the model quantum system considered in this work , and , now we describe the hartree fock mean field scheme to evaluate ground state energy and finally to determine persistent current as a function of flux @xmath0 .      to evaluate energy eigenvalues of the interacting helical conductor we use generalized hartree - fock mean field approach  @xcite where we decouple the interacting hamiltonian into the non - interacting ones such that one is associated with up spin electrons and the other",

    "[ eq5 ] also goes to the two outer arms with appropriate upper limits of the summation index as described before .    combining all these decoupled hamiltonians for different sub - parts we can write the effective hamiltonian for the full interacting conductor in a general way , for the sake of simplification , as @xmath53 now we can go through self - consistent procedure with these decoupled hamiltonians setting initial guess values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "first we construct @xmath56 and @xmath57 considering these @xmath54 and @xmath55 and then diagonalize these hamiltonians to find new set of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "again we repeat this procedure and continue it until a self - consistent solution is obtained .",
    "this is the most crucial step for mean - field scheme , and therefore , special emphasis should be given to choose the initial guess values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "once we get the self - consistent solution , the ground state energy of the system can be easily determined . at absolute zero temperature ( @xmath58k )",
    "it becomes , @xmath59 where the summation is taken upto the fermi energy @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 s and @xmath62 s are the eigenvalues of the sub - hamiltonians for up and down spin electrons , respectively .    finally ,",
    "we determine persistent current of the helical conductor , at absolute zero temperature , from the relation  @xcite , @xmath63 where , @xmath64 is the ground state energy in presence of flux @xmath0 which is determined by summing over lowest @xmath8 energy levels .",
    "@xmath8 represents the electron filling .",
    "now , we present the results which are computed numerically based on the above theoretical prescription ( discussed in sec .",
    "ii ) . the common parameters for our calculations , unless stated otherwise , are : @xmath65 , @xmath66ev , @xmath67ev and @xmath58k . throughout the analysis we measure the energy in unit of @xmath34 and current in unit of @xmath68 . here",
    ", we essentially focus on the variation of conformation dependent circular current in a helical conductor in presence of magnetic flux @xmath0 . before addressing this issue",
    ", first we describe the nature of energy - flux characteristics to make the present work a self - contained study .    in fig .",
    "[ energy ] we show the variation of ground state energy @xmath69 as a function of magnetic flux @xmath0 for a helical conductor considering its three different configurations , viz , undeformed , stretched and compressed .",
    "two different band fillings are considered to compute the ground state    energies and they are presented in two different columns . for the first column we set @xmath70 , while it is @xmath71 for the other column and in all these cases we determine @xmath69 considering three different values of @xmath10 to investigate the interplay between conformational change and on - site hubbard correlation . in this particular conductor",
    "we choose @xmath72 and it is distributed among four rings ( @xmath73 ) and three internal wires ( @xmath74 ) including two outer wires in appropriate numbers to get three distinct configurations of the helical conductor . comparing the spectra given in fig .",
    "[ energy ] it is observed that the ground state energy exhibits maximum variation with flux @xmath0 for the stretched configuration , irrespective of @xmath10 as well as band fillings ( @xmath75nd row of fig .",
    "[ energy ] ) and it becomes much flatter as we move towards the compressed one .",
    "this essentially leads to maximum circular current in the stretched case , while lesser currents are obtained in other two cases , which are described later in fig .",
    "[ current1 ] , since current is determined by taking the first order derivative of @xmath69 with respect to flux @xmath0 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq8 ] ) .",
    "with this conformation dependent variation it is also important to note that the ground state energy significantly increases with the rise of @xmath10 and the slope of @xmath69-@xmath0 curve changes in a large and/or small scale depending on the band filling , and it ( change in slope ) becomes much clearly seen from current - flux characteristics rather than @xmath69-@xmath0 spectra . all these ground state energies exhibit @xmath12 flux - quantum periodicity .    in fig .",
    "[ current1 ] we present the variation of persistent current    @xmath76 as a function of flux for a typical helical conductor with @xmath77 considering different values of @xmath10 for two distinct band fillings . in the first column",
    "the currents are shown for @xmath78 , while in the second column we compute the currents setting @xmath79 .",
    "the results are noteworthy .",
    "it is observed that the current becomes maximum for the stretched geometry and it gradually decreases as we increase the size of the ring i.e. , when we move towards the compressed one .",
    "this behavior is independent of the band filling as well as the hubbard interaction strength .",
    "the signature of higher current for the stretched conductor and smaller current for the other two configurations can be clearly understood from the variation of energy - flux characteristics discussed above .",
    "in addition it is also important to note that for the half - filled band case ( @xmath78 ) the current changes sharply with increasing @xmath10 , while away from half - filling ( @xmath80 ) it becomes less sensitive to @xmath10 .",
    "in all these cases current provides @xmath12 flux - quantum periodicity .",
    "the results discussed so far , viz , @xmath69-@xmath0 and @xmath76-@xmath0 spectra , are computed for some typical helical conductors where the number of    atomic sites @xmath17 in each ring is _",
    "even_. now , to check if any anomalous behavior is observed in current - flux characteristics for odd @xmath17 , in fig .  [ current2 ]",
    "we present the results of persistent currents considering helical conductor with @xmath81 ( odd @xmath17 ) .",
    "two different cases are shown , where in ( a ) currents are determined for @xmath78 ( half - filled ) , while in ( b ) they are computed when @xmath79 ( quarter - filled ) .",
    "the results are quite interesting . for the half - filled band case current exhibits @xmath11 flux - quantum periodicity instead of the @xmath12 periodicity as obtained in conventional cases .",
    "this typical behavior is only observed for the half - filled band case with odd ring size , since the current regains its @xmath12 periodicity as long as the electron filling gets changed which is clearly observed by comparing the spectra given in figs .",
    "[ current2](a ) and ( b ) . from our extensive numerical analysis",
    "we find that this @xmath11 periodicity is the generic feature of persistent current for odd @xmath17 in the half - filled band case , though its physical argument is not clear at this stage and we hope it can be analyzed in our future work . here , it is also significant to state that the current amplitude sharply decreases with @xmath10 for the half - filled case , while quite comparable currents are obtained for the other filling . in the limit of half - filling each atomic site",
    "is filled with an electron ( up or down ) , and thus , it does not allow to hop an electron from one site to the other due to repulsive nature of @xmath10 which results reduced current with increasing @xmath10 . while , for the system with less than half - filling there is always an empty site , and therefore , electron can hop into this empty site .",
    "the probability of electron hopping increases with lower value of @xmath10 , but it tends to decrease when @xmath10 exceeds the critical limit yielding a smaller current .",
    "this critical value strongly depends on the system size and electron filling .",
    "finally , we discuss the proximity effect between the atomic sites @xmath1 and    @xmath2 on circular current .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ currlamb ] , where we show the variation of typical current amplitude as a function of hopping integral @xmath37 setting @xmath82 .",
    "for all three different values of @xmath10 , we see that persistent current monotonically increases and after reaching the maximum at @xmath83ev , it eventually decreases with @xmath37 . at this typical value of @xmath37",
    ", the system behaves like a perfect one since we set @xmath84ev in our theoretical formulation , which results a maximum current . on the other hand for all other cases ( when @xmath85 and @xmath41 ) current decreases due to this anisotropy in the hopping integral .",
    "this anisotropy is directly related to the closeness of the atomic sites @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and thus , tuning the proximity between these atomic sites we can regulate current amplitude which might be helpful in designing current controlled device at nano - scale level .",
    "in the present work we investigate conformation dependent circular current in a single handed helical conductor in presence of ab flux @xmath0 .",
    "a tight - binding framework is given to illustrate the model where electronic correlation is analyzed in the hartree - fock mean field level .",
    "several important features are obtained from our numerical analysis those are summarized as follows .",
    "( i ) current amplitude can be controlled by stretching and compressing the geometry , keeping all other parameters unchanged .",
    "( ii ) both @xmath12 and @xmath11 flux - quantum periodicities are obtained in circular currents .",
    "the unconventional @xmath11 periodicity is observed only for the half - filled band case when the conductor contains rings with odd number of atomic sites .",
    "( iii ) circulating current can also be regulated by tuning the coupling parameter between the atomic sites @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we believe that all the results studied here can be utilized to investigate magneto - transport in several bio - molecular systems having this helical like geometry .",
    "in our analysis we compute the results for some typical parameter values of on - site energies , hopping integrals , system size , etc . , but all these features remain unchanged for any other set of parameter values which certainly demands an experimental verification towards this direction .",
    "the other valid approximation is the zero temperature limit , though finite temperature extension of our analysis is a very simple task .",
    "the crucial point is that the physical properties studied above are not affected as long as the average level spacing @xmath5 is greater than @xmath6 . for our geometry we can safely reach upto a sub - kelvin temperature limit"
