    "it measured the apparent positions of a few stars during the eclipse , within a few degrees from the solar limb , compared to their unperturbed relative positions ( e.g. in night time observations a few months away ) .",
    "the arc variation is interpreted in terms of light deflection , providing an estimate of the @xmath0 parameter with precision limited to 10% , i.e. to a @xmath3 accuracy estimation of the ppn @xmath0 parameter .",
    "the current best estimate of @xmath0 , from the cassini experiment , is in the @xmath4 range @xcite , based on the radio frequency shift technique , but with a significant burden on calibration : the refraction in the average solar corona is estimated to be of order of 0\".1 , at a radio wavelength of 20  cm , for a pencil beam passing at a minimum distance of 4 solar radii from the sun centre @xcite , i.e. comparable with the angular value of light deflection on the same trajectory .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 was estimated by the classical gr test on _ perihelion precession _ , by high precision astrometric",

    "the rationale for superposition of at least two fields is not so much related to _ multiplexing efficiency _ , since more stars are observed in the same exposure time , but rather to _ measurement accuracy _ : the satellite attitude and other instrumental factors affect in the same way the signal of all targets , allowing their rejection from differential astrometry as _ common mode _ disturbances .",

    "the differential measurement of deflection on two stars labelled 1 and 2 , at symmetric ecliptic latitude @xmath57 and @xmath58 , consists in a sun - ward observation , at an epoch 1 ( time @xmath59 ) in which their ecliptic longitude @xmath60 is close to the sun centre position , plus an observation at an epoch 2 ( time @xmath61 ) separated by six months , in which the star direction is opposite to the sun .",
    "the former epoch is associated with the maximum value of deflection for both stars ( @xmath62 ) ; the latter corresponds to the minimum deflection value ( @xmath63 ) , which will be often considered zero throughout the discussion for simplicity . comparing the images taken in both epochs ( at time @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) , the separation between the stars changes by an angular amount @xmath66 , corresponding to the deflection modulation ( adopting the notation : @xmath67 ) .",

    "notably , the deflection has to be taken into account at practically any distance from the sun , as non negligible at the @xmath5 level ; however , in practice , using the nominal deflection value , associated to @xmath68 , introduces negligible errors on star positions when the distance to the sun is large : e.g. , at @xmath69 , the amount of deflection is @xmath70 , and even a @xmath0 deviation from unity in the @xmath71 range modifies it at the @xmath72 level . the @xmath68 assumption is thus fully acceptable , at least as a first approximation , in the practical data reduction steps . would introduce a propagated error of order of @xmath50per star , i.e. compatible with the final goal of the mission . of course",

    "the optical scale is respectively @xmath145 for the small mission version of game ( @xmath146 ) and @xmath147 for the medium mission case ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "an image detected in the focal plane position @xmath149 is associated to a source in the sky having angular position @xmath150 ( gnomonic projection ) ; a scale variation modifies the image location by an amount proportional to the source position , thus introducing an error also on the _ estimated separation _ between stars . for the current computation ,",
    "the stars are considered as having constant angular position , flux etc .",
    ", and only instrument parameter variations are introduced .",
    "the case of one - dimensional measurement of @xmath151 isolated , well behaved stars with given source parameters ( magnitude , spectrum ) is considered ; their positions @xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) can be estimated with photon limited precision @xmath154 @xcite : @xmath155 depending on the instrument characteristics ( rms aperture size @xmath156 and observing wavelength @xmath26 ) , through the photometric signal to noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "the _ field centre _ ( fc ) of the set of stars is defined in the following as the average position @xmath157 , weighted by the individual location variance , using the maximum likelihood estimator : @xmath158 and the fc variance @xmath159 is @xmath160    in the photon limited case , the individual location error from eq .",
    "[ eq : elemprec ] for an observation collecting @xmath161 photons , is @xmath162 , where the parameter @xmath163 , used to factor out the other relevant parameters , represents formally the instrument performance for an object with @xmath164 .",
    "the fc variance becomes @xmath165 , i.e. it is naturally related to the total photometric level @xmath166 .",
    "the _ field size _ ( fs ) is defined as the rms distance @xmath167 of each star from the fc , i.e. the quantities @xmath168 , again weighted by the individual location variance : @xmath169    by construction , the relative distances have zero weighted average . however , the rms distance is a convenient parameter for instrument calibration purposes , since it is a differential quantity , independent e.g. from pointing .",
    "its variance is a function of the fc variance ( location precision ) and the field geometry : @xmath170 assuming that the star distribution is approximately uniform over the region @xmath171 $ ] , and that their location errors are comparable , i.e. @xmath172 , e.g. selecting sources in a limited magnitude and spectral range , then @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath176 , @xmath177 i.e. _ both fs and fc have comparable precision _ , improving with the sample size @xmath151 .    as a numerical example , applicable to a set of a few elementary exposures on a single ccd of the game focal plane , with @xmath178 stars measured at @xmath179 , for a field amplitude @xmath180",
    ", the fs is @xmath181 , and the fc standard deviation is @xmath182 .    assuming a small optical scale variation between epochs @xmath59 and @xmath61 , so that @xmath183 , each star location and the fc are displaced by an amount proportional to their value , i.e. @xmath184 , @xmath185 , and also @xmath186 .",
    "the variation can be monitored through the geometry of repeatedly measured fields : @xmath187 and is affected by a propagated error @xmath188 the precision is high because of the ratio between the individual location precision @xmath189 and the fs @xmath167 .",
    "it is therefore possible to define a convenient calibration field as having a widely spread distribution of comparably bright stars . using the numbers from the above numerical example",
    ", the scale calibration precision is @xmath190 .",
    "the optical scale monitoring over a few hours of observations , at full focal plane level , applied to the small mission version , with @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 , achieves a precision @xmath195 ; similarly , for the medium mission version , with @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 , the value attained is @xmath200 . in both cases ,",
    "the short term monitoring precision compares favourably with the requirements .",
    "similar considerations may be applied e.g. to the geometric calibration of the two gaia channels , observing in time delay integration long strips of the sky , with significant superposition of their @xmath201 width , at a rate of @xmath202 .",
    "the elementary exposure precision for medium to bright stars is @xmath203 , so that , on a limited region with @xmath204 stars , and size roughly corresponding to the astrometric focal plane , the optical scale monitoring performance on a data segment is @xmath205 .",
    "the performance significantly improves on longer strips , under the assumption of stability on short to intermediate time scales .",
    "this simple exercise supports the high expectations on gaia self - calibration properties .",
    "the general requirement on star location precision ( a few @xmath5 ) is mentioned in the introduction .",
    "however , stars are characterised by individual proper motion and parallax , modifying their position with time .",
    "to achieve a given precision level on the @xmath0 estimate , specific requirements on the knowledge of the star parameters can be set ; some of them , detailed below , may be subject to averaging depending on the number of stars @xmath206 contributing to the estimate , and/or the number of epoch pairs @xmath207 ( i.e. years ) in which the measurement is repeated .",
    "e.g. for the medium mission version of game , the goal precision is @xmath208 and a sample of @xmath209 stars is observed over @xmath210 years .",
    "the precision requirement on the individual star position @xmath9 can be derived by error propagation from eq .",
    "[ eq : gamma ] : @xmath211 this must be scaled according to the sample size , i.e. by a factor @xmath212 . measuring repeatedly the same stars ,",
    "no averaging on epochs is possible , since their individual coordinate error is applied each time .",
    "then the requirement on individual position uncertainty is @xmath213 i.e. challenging for current ground based catalogues ( gscii ) , but quite relaxed with respect e.g. to the expected performance of the forthcoming gaia catalogue in the game magnitude range .    _",
    "proper motion _ , in a determination of the light deflection using just the two observations taken over one year of operation , would introduce a significant error on the deflection estimate , if neglected .",
    "the total star position variation @xmath214 between sun - ward and outward observation epochs , separated by six months , is the sum of the apparent angular displacement associated to light deflection , i.e. @xmath8 from eq .",
    "[ eq : misner ] , and half the yearly proper motion @xmath215 : @xmath216 .",
    "+ however , most stars are observed @xmath217 times throughout the mission lifetime , and the sequence of measured positions includes both deflection modulation ( with a one year period ) and the constant drift associated to proper motion . the two contributions can easily be separated , with precision improving with @xmath218 @xcite .    _",
    "parallax _ , conversely , is most critical , since the star motion induced by the orbital motion of the earth around the sun has the same period and phase of deflection modulation .",
    "a schematic of the parallax ellipse , followed in opposite direction in the two hemispheres , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : obsstrat ] .",
    "the two measurement epochs of game , approximately corresponding to the conjunction and opposition of each star with the sun , respectively for high and low deflection conditions , are labelled as points @xmath219 and @xmath220 in figure . at @xmath221 ,",
    "the ellipse is strongly elongated in the east - west direction , so that the parallax component in the deflection measurement direction ( north - south ) is reduced by a geometric factor @xmath222 , i.e. , for a star at @xmath223 , to @xmath224 .    observing strategy : epochs a and b are the nominal deflection determination positions ; c and d ( and similarly e and f ) are the parallax determination positions . ]",
    "proper motion and parallax correction at the few @xmath5 level corresponding to the game goal appears to be marginally compatible with the gaia catalogue ; however , it is convenient to define a self - consistent observing strategy for game",
    ". this can be done by adding further observing epochs , labelled c , d , e and f in fig .",
    "[ fig : obsstrat ] , thus allowing full astrometric reconstruction for the whole stellar sample , and a most important cross - calibration tool .    given the proposed concept of multiple field observation ,",
    "the sun - ward and outward fields are pointed simultaneously in e.g. @xmath219 and @xmath220 positions ( high and low deflection ) respectively . at a time difference of about one month",
    ", the fields can be observed again at @xmath225 from the sun , in the position pairs @xmath226 or @xmath227 , in different , known phases with respect to both deflection and parallax modulation .",
    "stars in the @xmath226 ( and respectively @xmath227 ) positions are affected by opposite displacement in the east - west direction , due to parallax geometry , @xmath228 times larger than that suffered in epochs a / b ( in the north - south direction ) .",
    "the repeated observation scheme requires that the gc / gac regions are scanned subsequently three times , i.e. before , during and after the sun conjunction .",
    "the sequence takes about six months a year , which leaves @xmath229 of the observing time for other science goals .",
    "the game data set from the multiple epoch observing strategy will thus provide a relative astrometry catalogue for general purpose astronomy , at a precision level comparing well with that of the gaia catalogue , apart serving the needs for calibration and self - consistency of the game data reduction .",
    "the superposition in a suitable configuration of several fields provides constraints among the measurements which may allow a significant mitigation of systematic errors , in particular related to base angle variations .",
    "the additional benefit is a clear assessment of the measurement systematic error related to the base angle from the science data , due to the double differential technique , providing both self - calibration and monitoring .",
    "a simple implementation scheme is outlined , which can be easily adapted to different instrument scales , depending on the performance goal and other constraints .",
    "due to the flexibility of pupil mask and telescope geometry of a fizeau interferometer , the actual design can be tailored to fit the system requirements , e.g. accommodation of other payloads .    the considerations on systematic error control from sec .",
    "[ sec : multiplefield ] must take into account the limitations imposed by the real sky distribution of stars : in particular , the terms in eqs .  [",
    "eq : deflmod1234 ] and [ eq : dba1234 ] will not have exactly the same statistical weight , depending at least on the photon limit .",
    "in particular , the gc region , due to the higher star count , dominates the statistics , with a corresponding precision two to three times better than the gac region ; therefore , the systematic error assessment is basically limited by the latter , whereas the former sets the limiting noise ( random error ) on the @xmath0 measurement .",
    "the game concept appears therefore suited to photon limited estimation of the ppn parameter @xmath0 , down to the @xmath230 level , according to the experiment implementation scale .",
