    "the study of the quark gluon plasma in the laboratory through hadronic collisions represents one of the largest current initiatives in nuclear physics .",
    "although these volumes are manifestly finite , modeling of the collisions seldom addresses the impact of the finiteness as most treatments are based on the the grand canonical ensemble where the conservation constraints of baryon number , strangeness , isospin and color are ignored .",
    "indeed , one expects that these constraints would become meaningless for larger volumes . the effective volume for a @xmath1 collision might be only a few cubic fm , while the volume of a rhic collision might be a few thousand cubic fm .",
    "but even in a rhic collision , the duration of the quark gluon phase might be only a few fm / c , meaning that the effective volume for charge conservation may be a few dozen cubic fm .",
    "recently , the effects of local charge conservation have gained more attention due to the relationship of charge conservation to charge fluctuations and charge balance functions@xcite .",
    "these observables are intimately related to the delay of hadronization expected should a quark - gluon plasma be created .",
    "recent papers have focused on the importance of conserving electric charge , strangeness and baryon number , as well as the dynamics of charge equilibration @xcite .",
    "the statistical mechanics of a finite - volume hadron gas have been studied in the context of pion flavor distributions@xcite .",
    "the approaches for solving the canonical ensemble can be divided into two classes . in the first set of approaches",
    ", one can sum over all partition functions in the grand canonical ensemble assuming the chemical potentials are imaginary , @xmath2 . by integrating over all @xmath3 ,",
    "the phase factor becomes a delta function which restricts the phase space to states with @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this approach can even be applied to non - abelian symmetries such as su(n)@xcite . by associating @xmath5 charges , @xmath6 , with the @xmath5-fold cartan subgroup",
    ", one can restrict the ensemble to states with specific charges @xmath7 , which can then be associated with the su(3 ) multiplet labels , @xmath8 , by a transformation .",
    "these techniques work well for simple systems , e.g. massless partons , where the integral over complex phases can be be performed analytically .",
    "multiple charges can be readily incorporated , including conservation of overall momentum .    the second class of approaches for the canonical ensemble centers about recursion relations which were proposed by chase and mekjian@xcite for the study of nuclear fragmentation .",
    "these methods have been extended to include quantum statistics@xcite and non - additive charges@xcite , such as angular momentum and isospin .",
    "in addition to partition functions , these methods can also generate multiplicity distributions@xcite .",
    "the advantage of these methods is that , given the one - particle partition functions , they provide exact answers .",
    "since these methods involve sums , rather than integration over phases , they provide robust answers for arbitrary energy levels .",
    "furthermore , symmetrization is included to all orders .",
    "if the number of particles to be considered remains below 100 , numerical calculations tend to take only seconds or minutes at most .",
    "we review recursive techniques for canonical ensembles and present extensions to incorporate conservation of color in the next section . in the subsequent section",
    "a simple example of a non - interacting quark - gluon gas is explored .",
    "canonical partition functions are generated which enforce conservation of baryon number , strangeness and charge , while requiring the system to be in an isosinglet and in a color singlet .",
    "bose and fermi statistics are included to all order .",
    "energy , entropy , and particle number densities are all shown to be significantly suppressed for small volumes , less than 5 @xmath0 .",
    "arguments are made that these effects are unlikely to be important in a relativistic heavy ion collision , but might be quite important for @xmath1 collisions .",
    "for additive charges , canonical partition functions can be calculated in a straight - forward manner .",
    "neglecting symmetrization , conservation of a set of charges @xmath9 can be enforced through the recursion relation , @xmath10 here , @xmath11 refers to all particles species of charge @xmath12 whose single - particle partition functions are : @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the individual energy levels of energy @xmath15 and degeneracy @xmath16 .",
    "the number @xmath17 must be positive for every species . for low energy nuclear physics applications",
    ", @xmath17 could be the baryon number and @xmath18 would represent one of the conserved charges . for a high - energy system",
    "where anti - particles must be included and there are no positive - definite conserved charges , @xmath18 can refer to the number of hadrons .",
    "this number is positive - definite , but as the number of hadrons is not conserved , one must consider all @xmath18 to obtain the partition function , @xmath19 .",
    "symmetrization can be incorporated by considering all permutations of identical particles @xcite , @xmath20 where a sum over all @xmath21 permutations of the single particle levels accounts for the symmetrization and @xmath22 counts the number of pair - wise interchanges of fermions involved in the permutation @xmath23 .    by considering the cyclic permutation ,",
    "@xmath24 one can derive a modified recursion relation , @xmath25 by summing over all possible values of @xmath26 , symmetrization is included to all orders .    before addressing su(3 ) symmetries",
    ", we review the techniques used for su(2 ) as described in @xcite . extending the techniques described above to incorporate an su(2 ) symmetry such as isospin or angular momentum",
    "can be accomplished in two ways .",
    "first , one can consider the projection @xmath27 as an additive charge and solve for @xmath28 with the method outlined above .",
    "given the @xmath29 degeneracy of all multiplets of size @xmath30 , the partition function for states with fixed @xmath30 is easily obtained from the partition function for fixed @xmath27 , @xmath31 .",
    "the second technique requires one to understand the decomposition of the cycle diagrams into su(2 ) multiplets . in terms of the projection operator , @xmath32 , which projects states with total isospin @xmath30 and projection @xmath27",
    ", one can define the isospin decomposition of the cycle diagram .",
    "@xmath33 where @xmath34 is the operator @xmath35 evaluated with the particles being combined to one quantum state of zero energy .",
    "the subscript @xmath36 refers to a specific multiplet , not the individual states .",
    "for instance , @xmath36 might refer to pions and @xmath37 would be the partition function for a given species of pion .",
    "the details about the energy levels are absorbed in @xmath38 while @xmath39 is independent of the energy levels , but does depend on the isospin of the particular species , @xmath40 .",
    "once @xmath34 is known , one can calculate the partition function for fixed @xmath30 recursively .",
    "@xmath41 one could have added indices @xmath27 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 onto @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath34 respectively . however , as each of these functions involve a trace over all states , and the hamiltonian has no dependence on the isospin projection , none of these quantities has any dependence on the projection and the indices can be suppressed . the function",
    "@xmath46 counts the number of multiplets of size @xmath30 that one obtains by coupling @xmath47 with @xmath14 . for su(2 ) , these obey a simple form .",
    "@xmath48 before performing the recursive calculations described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : recursivesu2 ] ) , one needs a simple expression for @xmath34 .",
    "this can be accomplished by realizing that by summing over @xmath14 one obtains the projection of states with fixed @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath49 since the states @xmath50 are eigenstates of @xmath51 , the bra and ket must be identical , i.e. , all particles must be identical and have the same isospin projection .",
    "@xmath52 since @xmath53 is independent of @xmath43 when @xmath43 is a member of the isomultiplet @xmath14 , the sum over @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : isosum ] ) can be limited to @xmath54 .",
    "it is then straight - forward to see that @xmath55 here , the index @xmath43 is suppressed since @xmath39 is independent of @xmath43 as long as @xmath43 is a member of the isomultiplet @xmath14 . for the @xmath56 case , e.g. , pions or @xmath57 mesons , @xmath58 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and @xmath61 for @xmath62 .    restricting su(3 )",
    "color can be accomplished with the same procedure . following the same steps as the su(2 ) case",
    ", one can derive analogous expressions , @xmath63 here , @xmath64 denotes an su(3 ) multiplet , e.g. , the gluon color octet is represented by @xmath65 . for an explanation fo the notation see @xcite .",
    "again , the challenge in making eq .",
    "( [ eq : recursivesu3 ] ) tractable is in finding expressions for @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "coupling su(3 ) multiplets , i.e. , finding expressions for @xmath68 , follows rules based on manipulating young tableaus @xcite . for the calculations in this paper",
    ", these rules were programmed numerically .",
    "finding an expression for @xmath66 requires performing a color decomposition of the cycle diagrams and can be done analogously as was shown above for su(2 ) .",
    "first , one must project states of a given @xmath3 , where @xmath3 represents the eigenvalues of the projection operators in su(3 ) , e.g. , hyper - charge and @xmath69 for su(3 ) flavor . as with the su(2 ) example above , this projection is realized by summing @xmath70 over all @xmath8 multiplets which include the projection @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath71 again , the @xmath3 dependence in @xmath39 represents the known degeneracy of @xmath3 within a given @xmath8 multiplet .    at this point ,",
    "we proceed by considering gluons as an example , and drop the index @xmath36 . for @xmath26 gluons in a given quantum state the trace of @xmath72 will be zero unless @xmath3 corresponds to @xmath26 identical gluons .",
    "the upper - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bosesu3 ] displays the projections @xmath3 that result from this trace applied for five gluons .",
    "the upper - right and lower - left panels display the @xmath73 and @xmath74 multiplets . by careful inspection",
    ", one can see that the states along the diagonal , as shown in the lower - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bosesu3 ] , are represented by the combination , @xmath75 . by subtracting the same object evaluated with @xmath76 and adding two color singlets",
    ", one can see that @xmath77 inserting this expression into eq .",
    "( [ eq : recursivesu3 ] ) allows one to account for bose effects in the gluonic partition function .",
    "quarks are represented by the multiplet @xmath78 while anti - quarks are represented by the multiplet @xmath79 .",
    "following the same ideas as were illustrated for the gluons , one can show @xmath80    by combining the recursion relations for additive charges , which are used to account for baryon and strangeness conservation , with the recursive techniques for su(2 ) , which are used to enforce conservation of isospin , and the methods for su(3 ) which account for color , one can construct a recursive prescription which account for all the charges in a parton gas .",
    "one might also choose to write partition functions for subsystems , e.g. , the strange quarks or the gluons , then convolute the partition functions together to find the partition function of the combined system .",
    "for instance , partitions for the two subsystems @xmath81 and @xmath82 can be combined to find the combined partition function , @xmath83",
    "the methods described in the last section were applied to the example of a parton gas in a volume @xmath84 at a temperature , @xmath85 mev .",
    "the gluons , up - quarks and down - quarks were assumed to be massless , while the strange quark was assumed to have mass of 150 mev .",
    "the single - particle partition functions were calculated by integrating over the momenta , @xmath86 the two helicities were accounted for by the factor of two preceding the expression .",
    "one could easily account for shell effects by replacing the integral over momentum with a discrete sum .",
    "although discrete states are more consistent given the bose and fermi effects described above , the continuous form for @xmath87 is used here so that charge conservation effects can be viewed separately .      1 .",
    "the gluon partition function , @xmath88 , was calculated recursively by first calculating for all numbers of gluons @xmath18 , then summing over @xmath18 .",
    "2 .   the partition function for strange quarks , @xmath89 , was generated .",
    "the partition function for anti - strange quarks , @xmath90 , was then generated by switching @xmath8 with @xmath91 .",
    "the partition function of the strange / anti - strange quark system was found by summing over all partition functions with equal numbers of @xmath92 and @xmath93 quarks .",
    "@xmath94 3 .",
    "the partition function for up and down quarks were calculated separately . in terms of the isospin projection , @xmath43 , and",
    "the net number of up / down quarks , @xmath18 , the partition function for the up and down quarks is : @xmath95 4 .",
    "the partition function for @xmath96 quarks is calculated by interchanging @xmath97 and @xmath98 . in the same manner as the @xmath99 quarks were convoluted , the @xmath100 and @xmath96 partition functions were convoluted to find the partition function for @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 quarks with the constraint of zero baryon number , @xmath105 , where @xmath27 is the isospin projection .",
    "the partition function for the @xmath106 system constrained to an isosinglet is calculated by taking the difference of the @xmath107 and @xmath108 partition functions .",
    "6 .   using eq .",
    "( [ eq : convolution ] ) , the partition function for the @xmath109 system were generated .",
    "this was then convoluted with the partition function for gluons to find the partition function for the entire system .",
    "energy densities can be calculated with the well - known formula , @xmath110 .",
    "this requires performing the calculation at two adjacent temperatures , doubling the cpu time of calculating the partition function .",
    "thus , an alternative approach was developed where recursion relations were derived for @xmath111 .",
    "recursion relations were also generated for the trace of @xmath112 , where @xmath113 could be one of several number operators , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 or @xmath117 .",
    "the recursion relations for these functions were calculated simultaneously with the recursion relations for the partition functions with little penalty in cpu time , because all calculations involve the same calculations of @xmath118 .",
    "figure [ fig : se ] shows the energy and entropy densities as a function of the volume .",
    "both the entropy , @xmath119 , and the energy are lowered by the reduction in the available states due to the conservation constraints .",
    "the grand canonical limit , represented by the dashed lines , is approached at large volumes . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "restricting the matter to a color singlet reduces the partition function by a factor which scales as @xmath120 .",
    "the other charge conservation constraints result in additional reductions to the quark sectors",
    ". a reduction of @xmath120 to the partition functions corresponds to a reduction of @xmath121 to the entropy and energy densities . since the bulk contributions scale as @xmath84",
    "the logarithmic conservation penalties become irrelevant at large volumes .",
    "the chemical decomposition of the various species behave similarly as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chemistry ] .",
    "the color penalty for gluons is more severe than the color penalties for quarks since gluons effectively have larger color charges and are less likely to couple to a singlet .    from fig.s",
    "[ fig : se ] and [ fig : chemistry ] , it is clear that conservation rules are important for volumes of 5 @xmath0 or less .",
    "it is therefore important to take such considerations into account in @xmath1 or @xmath122 collisions .",
    "heavy ion collisions at rhic occupy thousands of cubic fm .",
    "however , the local nature of charge conservation results in an effective volume which is determined by the initial conditions , and the diffusion of the various charges . given that the color of a projectile nucleon is spread over several units of rapidity by the initial stopping process , and given the spread of charge over a few fm in the transverse direction , it would be difficult to make a case that the effective volumes are less than a few dozen cubic fm .",
    "it should be emphasized that the determining factor for the importance of conservation constraints is the number of partons in the effective volume .",
    "for massless partons , the density of partons is expected to exceed 10 @xmath123 in a during the first one or two fm / c of a rhic collision . if the degrees of freedom are restricted by another means , e.g. , a large effective mass for partons , the relative penalty for color conservation would increase .",
