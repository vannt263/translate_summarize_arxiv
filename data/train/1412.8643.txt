    "phase separation in non - equilibrium driven diffusive systems has been a topic of considerable interest over a long time @xcite . unlike their equilibrium counterparts ,",
    "such systems have been found to exhibit phase separation , even in one dimension .",
    "some well known examples include abc model @xcite , the lr model @xcite , and the ekls model @xcite .",
    "a salient feature of these systems has been the presence of an effective long - range interaction or a short - range dynamics with more than one conserved quantities being driven through the systems .",
    "a general criterion for phase separation in such systems has been conjectured by mapping the driven diffusive system to a zero - range process ( zrp ) @xcite .",
    "it was argued that a condensation transition in the mapped zrp would correspond to a phase separation in the lattice .",
    "the conjecture was then successfully used to investigate the existence of phase separation in ahr model @xcite and later in the ekls model .    in all",
    "these driven diffusive systems , hardcore point particles on a lattice evolve following a dynamical rule which might be local , but effectively generates long range interaction between particles due to the choice of hop rates or the presence of a nonzero current .",
    "presence of extended objects could change the scenario , as they bring in their own natural length scales .",
    "in particular , reconstitution , if present , can generate extended objects of arbitrary lengths , facilitating the possibility of phase separation .",
    "the statistical mechanics of diffusion of extended objects has been studied long ago by tonks in @xcite to find out the equation of state of the system in one- and higher dimensions . in one dimension , the extended objects with integer lengths are modeled by @xmath0-mers , which is an object occupying @xmath1 lattice sites and obeys hard - core exclusion .",
    "a driven system involving single species @xmath1-mer was first studied in context of protein synthesis in prokaryotic cells @xcite to understand the underlying physical mechanism . in a relatively newer study @xcite , the time evolution of the conditional probabilities of the site occupation ,",
    "starting from a known initial configuration has been calculated for such a system .",
    "phase diagram and currents in different phases are also worked out using an extremal principle based on a domain wall theory @xcite . local density evolution governed by the hydrodynamic equations",
    "have been framed by mapping the model of diffusing @xmath1-mers to the zrp @xcite .",
    "other works include studying the effect of local inhomogeneities and defects in these models @xcite .",
    "the spatial correlation functions in models with diffusing @xmath0-mers show oscillatory behaviour which decays for large distance @xcite ; in the continuum limit , the exact scaling functions in such a model are the same as obtained for a driven tonks gas @xcite    reconstitution dynamics has been studied for one dimensional systems consisting of only monomers and dimers @xcite ; these systems generally show strong ergodicity breaking .",
    "later studies @xcite generalized these models to include asymmetric diffusion of @xmath0-mers up to a maximum length @xmath2 .",
    "this brings into picture kinematic waves and kpz non - linearity in general .",
    "these models have large number of conserved quantities , _",
    "i.e. , _ conservation of number of @xmath0-mers of all lengths ; therefore inhibiting the possibility of having large objects . in another work @xcite ,",
    "an asymmetric fragmentation process was studied where @xmath0-mers could break or combine when separated by one vacancy ; for specific rates the model could mapped to the totally asymmetric exclusion process @xcite , resulting in an exponential distribution of @xmath0-mers with a finite cut - off .    in this article",
    "we consider a system of hard poly - dispersed @xmath0-mers undergoing asymmetric diffusion and a reconstitution dynamics in one dimensional periodic lattice .",
    "the latter allows formation of polymers of arbitrary lengths , keeping only two conserved quantities , namely , the total number of @xmath0-mers and the site occupation density .",
    "the systems we study are poly - dispersed , _",
    "i.e. , _ in general the lattice under consideration has a mixture of particles of various sizes .",
    "in these models , along with the size dependent asymmetric diffusion rates , @xmath0-mers ( except monomers ) also undergo a reconstitution dynamics .",
    "those @xmath0-mers which can not diffuse due to hardcore restriction can transfer a single monomer unit between them with a rate which depends on their lengths .",
    "since monomers do not participate in reconstitution dynamics , the total number of @xmath1-mers is conserved .",
    "we show that in presence of such a reconstitution process the system undergoes novel phase separation transitions forming either a macroscopically large @xmath0-mer , or a macroscopic large void or both .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section ii .",
    "we define the model and describe how it can be mapped to a two species zrp .",
    "we follow this by showing that the steady state has a product measure . in section iii .",
    "we study the model for a specific case when the drift velocities are distributed like a step function and explore the possibilities of a four phase scenario . in section iv .",
    "we show that for a specific choice of diffusion and reconstituting rates , the model has similarities with an ordinary zrp .",
    "we further show that the specific choice indeed leads to a novel phase diagram with four distinct phases .",
    "finally , we summarize the results in section v along with some discussions .",
    "we consider @xmath3 number of @xmath0-mers , each having different integer length @xmath4 with @xmath5 distributed on a one dimensional ( 1d ) periodic lattice of @xmath6 sites , following hard core exclusion .",
    "the sites of the lattice are labeled by the index @xmath7 a @xmath0-mer is a hard extended object which occupies @xmath0 consecutive sites on a lattice , and can be denoted by a string of @xmath0 consecutive @xmath8s .",
    "( here represented by @xmath9 ) .",
    "thus , every configuration of the system can be represented by a binary sequence with each site being identified as a @xmath10 or @xmath8 denoting respectively whether the lattice site is occupied by a @xmath0-mer or not .",

    "we define free volume ( or void density ) as @xmath13 and the @xmath0-mer number density density as @xmath14 .",
    "thus @xmath15 and the packing fraction ( fraction of volume occupied by the @xmath0-mers ) is @xmath16    we assume that there is an intrinsic drive in the system which forces the particles to move in one direction , say towards right , with a rate that depends on size of the @xmath0-mer @xmath17    along with this dynamics we also consider a reconstitution process among neighboring @xmath0-mers where one of the @xmath0-mers may release a single particle ( or monomer ) which instantly join the other @xmath0-mer .",

    "in tmap , @xmath10- and @xmath0- particles hop out from a box @xmath39 containing @xmath40 number of @xmath10- and @xmath0-particles respectively to one of the neighboring boxes @xmath41 having @xmath42 particles with rates @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "now , the dynamics of the reconstituting @xmath0-mers can be written as @xmath45 where the hop rate of @xmath10- particles @xmath46 does not depend on @xmath47 the number of particles of its own kind .",
    "the @xmath48-functions in the first equation forces @xmath10-particles to move towards left ( same as @xmath0-mers moving to right ) and those in the last equation takes care of the restrictions that reconstitution or monomer exchange occurs among neighboring boxes only when they are devoid of @xmath10-particles ( equivalently , when @xmath0-mers are immobile ) .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath10-particles is similar to that of a inhomogeneous zrp @xcite where hop rate of particles are different at different sites , but the background disorder here evolve continuously through reconstitution process .",

    "we study the model in the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) and locate the regions in parameter space where macroscopic densities has a critical limit beyond which the densities can not be controlled merely by tuning the fugacities .",
    "therefore in these regions , a system having a conserved density larger than the critical limit is expected to produce a condensate carrying a finite fraction of particles in the system .",

    "we avoid writing down those long expressions explicitly . instead , in the following , we focus on the results only at the critical limits .",
    "it is evident that @xmath198 diverges as @xmath199 ( logarithmically ) and for @xmath200 .",
    "as long as the equivalence of grand canonical and canonical ensemble holds _",
    "i.e. , _ in the density regions bounded by the parametric curves @xmath201 and @xmath202 in the @xmath203 plane , the system remains in the fluid - phase .",
    "condensation occurs when these parametric functions become finite valued @xmath118 then in the canonical ensemble , densities larger than these values does not have any representative fugacities , thus resulting in condensation . for @xmath194",

    "four different phases a ( fluid ) , b ( @xmath0-condensate ) , c ( @xmath10-condensate , and d ( condensation of both @xmath0- and @xmath10-particles are shown here for densities @xmath213 and @xmath214 respectively .",
    "@xmath0-mers are represented by @xmath50 blue pixels ending with a red pixel corresponding to the engine , vacancies are colored as orange . here ,",
    "@xmath215,width=377,height=340 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig:4pb3 ] ( a ) we have plotted these parametric functions @xmath216 versus @xmath217 for @xmath103 varying @xmath218 ( blue curve ) and then for @xmath104 varying @xmath219 ( red curve ) .",
    "these two critical lines encapsulate a region where macroscopic density is well described by the fugacities @xmath92 and @xmath90 ( denoted by a , the fluid phase ) . to investigate the possibility of condensation in the other density regions , we follow the grokinsky criteria @xcite described in the previous section .",
    "in fact , the phase diagram for a different model having the same steady state structure has been explored in details @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-condensate occurs in the region beyond @xmath103 curve ( denoted by b ) , whereas @xmath10-particles condensate in the density region above @xmath104 curve in @xmath220-@xmath36 plane ( denoted as c ) .",
    "finally the density region @xmath221 corresponds to condensation of both kind of particles .",
    "the transition lines in box - particle picture are then translated to the @xmath0-mer densities on the lattice using eq . .",
    "correspondingly , the @xmath0-mers show three different kind of phase separated states along with the fluid phase a , as shown in fig . [ fig:4pb3](b ) .",
    "note that , the fluid phase here corresponds to a phase where @xmath0-mers are well mixed with the vacancies .",
    "this requires small free volume @xmath222 and large @xmath0-mer number density @xmath25 so that size of each @xmath0-mer is small .    to demonstrate the four - phase scenario , we simulate the drifting reconstituting @xmath0-mer dynamics on a system of size @xmath223 . starting from a random initial distribution of @xmath0-mers the system is allowed to evolve for @xmath212 mcs ; for the next @xmath224 mcs , we store the location and size of @xmath0-mers and color them as follows , @xmath0-mer : blue , engine : red and vacancy : orange .",
    "figure [ fig : t_evo ] ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) and ( d ) shows the space - time ( downwards ) plot of these configurations for four different points @xmath225 and @xmath226 , representing four different phases respectively .",
    "all three different condensate phases show striking co - existence features whereas the fluid phase is well mixed .",
    "note that @xmath0-particles show a localized condensate as reconstitution ( or @xmath0-particle hop in tmap ) occurs symmetrically , whereas the @xmath10-condensate moves towards left .",
    "in this article we study the possibility of phase separation transition in a one dimensional system of poly - dispersed hard extended objects called @xmath0-mers which occupy @xmath0 consecutive lattice sites .",
    "a @xmath0-mer can move by one lattice site with a rate @xmath27 which depends on its size , if the rightward neighbor is vacant .",
    "along with the drift , @xmath0-mers also undergo reconstitution , where two consecutive @xmath0-mers of size @xmath0 and @xmath227 , if immobile due to hardcore constraint ( _ i.e. _ , their immediate right neighbor are not vacant ) can exchange one particle between them with rate @xmath228 ; thus their sizes become either @xmath229 or @xmath230 this dynamics conserves the total volume occupied by the @xmath0-mers .",
    "we also impose an additional conservation of the number of @xmath0-mers by restricting @xmath231 for @xmath30 .",
    "we find that this additional conservation can lead to four distinct phases : ( a ) a fluid phase where similar size @xmath0-mers are well mixed with the vacancies , ( b ) one macroscopic @xmath0-mer and rest of the system remaining homogeneous , ( c ) a very slow moving @xmath0-mer leaving a trail of vacancies ( macroscopic void ) in front of it , and ( d ) a macroscopic void along with a macroscopic @xmath0-mer .",
    "we could obtain the exact boundaries which separate four different phases by mapping the model to a two - species misanthrope process ( tmap ) by considering @xmath0-mers as boxes containing @xmath50 particles of one kind ( called @xmath0-particles ) and the number of vacancies in front of it as particles of other type ( called @xmath10-particles ) .",
    "the effective dynamics in tmap becomes the following : @xmath0-particles in boxes which are devoid of @xmath10- particles evolve following the dynamics of a misanthrope process with rate @xmath232 and the @xmath10-particles hop with a inhomogeneous rate that depend on the number of @xmath0-particles present in the box .",
    "the interplay of interaction between two different species is now evident .",
    "@xmath0- particles hop only when both departure and arrival boxes are devoid of @xmath10-particles , and @xmath10-particle hop rate depends on the number of @xmath0-particles .",
    "we must mention that in zrp and related models with one or more species , if a dynamics involving asymmetric hopping of particles ( say , only to rightward neighbour ) evolve to a factorized steady state , then the model also shares the same steady state if particle hopping were symmetric . in the model that we have studied , in the presence of directional drive",
    ", reconstitution occurs when two @xmath0-mers are ( a ) in contact , and ( b ) the right @xmath0-mer has no empty site to its right .",
    "in fact , condition ( b ) naturally decouples the dynamics of @xmath10 and @xmath0-particles and help in obtaining an explicit factorized steady state .",
    "when @xmath0-mers drift only towards right , the condition ( b ) can be interpreted as follows : only immobile @xmath0-mers ( which are more likely to remain in contact ) can exchange particle among them . in case of symmetric diffusion of @xmath0-particle , such an interpretation would be lost in @xmath0-mer picture , but the steady state however is _ not _ altered . to model a more realistic situation like dynamics of polymerization @xcite or filaments in micro channels @xcite ,",
    "we need to extend this dynamics to higher dimensions and to include a fusion dynamics which breaks the conservation of number of @xmath0-mers and a fragmentation dynamics which allow breaking of a @xmath0-mer into two random segments .    _",
