    "we begin recalling the interest of core collapse supernovae , the status of their understanding , and the expectations for neutrino emission in the standard scenario .",
    "next , we discuss in sect .",
    "[ what ] the motivations for an improved analysis of sn1987a observations in the context of the standard scenario .",
    "finally , we offer an outline of the present investigation .",
    "core collapse supernovae ( sn ) are astrophysical events in which all known forces interplay with each other in extreme physical conditions .",
    "an adequate modeling of the processes occurring during this event would be important to obtain information on the left - over compact star @xcite , on nucleosynthesis @xcite , on the properties of the supernova remnant @xcite , and on the expected signals during the explosion ; in particular , gravitational waves and neutrinos  @xcite .    because of the complexity of the problem , the modeling of the physical processes is still in evolution , but it is generally accepted that the role of neutrinos is critical for the energy transport as first suggested in @xcite .",
    "the collapse and the formation of a compact object , like a neutron star , have to pass through substantial neutrino emission , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the details of how the explosion takes place and how the neutrinos are emitted are less clear and necessarily model dependent . in this work",
    "we focus on the only mechanism that has been studied in some detail : the _ neutrino - driven mechanism _ also known as bethe and wilson scenario  @xcite or delayed scenario for the explosion . in the neutrino - driven mechanism , the explosion of the massive star receives crucial assistance from the energy deposition due to an initial , intense neutrino luminosity .",
    "although the viability of this mechanism can not be considered fully demonstrated at present , recent theoretical results  @xcite encourage the opinion that the neutrino - driven mechanism works for certain core collapse  sn .    in the neutrino - driven mechanism ,",
    "there are two main phases of neutrino emission : + _ i _ ) a thermal phase , called _ cooling _ , occurring when the proto - neutron star cools quietly .",
    "this phase involves most of the emitted neutrinos , 80 - 90% in energy .",
    "+ _ ii _ ) a brief and very luminous neutrino emission , here termed _ accretion _",
    ", that should involve a lower amount of neutrinos , 10 - 20% in energy .",
    "the accretion phase characterizes the neutrino - driven mechanism of the explosion , and it is expected to occur in the first stage of neutrino emission . in this phase , the matter is rapidly accreting over the proto - neutron star through the stalled supernova shock wave .",
    "the two most important processes of neutrino emission are @xmath3 due to the abundant presence of nucleons and of quasi - thermal @xmath4 plasma",
    ". these types of neutrinos ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) transfer to the star a small fraction of their energy , @xmath7 , necessary to revive the stalled shock wave .",
    "see  @xcite for a wide description of the phase of accretion , enriched by analytical arguments .",
    "the neutrinos from phases _ i _ ) and _ ii _ ) can be observed in conventional supernova neutrino detectors @xcite ( namely , water cherenkov and scintillators ) . in particular electron antineutrinos",
    "give signal mainly through inverse beta decay reaction on free protons : @xmath8 thus the existence of the accretion and cooling phases , generically expected in the neutrino - driven scenario , can be experimentally verified .",
    "sn1987a is the first and the only occasion at present to test the credibility of the various hypotheses on how a sn works .",
    "in fact , the events observed by imb  @xcite , kamiokande - ii @xcite and baksan @xcite , represent a historic opportunity to investigate the physics of the collapse and of the explosion .",
    "a very extensive literature testifies the effort to extract information from these data with a wide variety of methods @xcite .",
    "usually , a specific characteristic of the sn1987a data is studied , most frequently the energy distribution .",
    "the energy and the time distributions are jointly considered in a few analyses , but most often describing the neutrino emission with ( overly ) simple models , a procedure that is only partially justified by the limited amount of events collected .",
    "the next neutrino observation will be an extraordinary occasion to progress , but recall that sn are rare on human time scale and it is not possible to reliably predict when the next one will happen .",
    "thus , we should try our best using the only data that we have at our disposal , and in particular , we should attempt to address the question on _ whether there is a hint of accretion from sn1987a observations _ , as expected . in this respect ,",
    "a point that deserves to be stressed is that all detectors observed a relatively large number of events in the first second of data taking , about 40 % : there are in fact 6 events in kamiokande - ii , 3 events in imb and 2 events in baksan .",
    "a milestone for the point of discussion and more in general for sn1987a data analysis is the paper of lamb and loredo  @xcite ( ll in the following ) , where it is argued that the sn1987a observations can be used to claim for an evidence of the accretion phase .",
    "the ll paper , widely cited in theoretical and experimental reviews , is generally considered a useful application of refined statistical techniques and , in the present paper , we will provide the first independent verification of their results .",
    "however , we deem that , in view of the importance of their claim and in the light of various advances in neutrino physics ( e.g. , in oscillations ,  @xcite and @xcite ) , it is necessary to offer a critical discussion of the assumptions of the analysis by lamb and loredo .",
    "more specifically : + 1 ) the likelihood structure can be enhanced including a more accurate detection cross section  @xcite , the information on the directions of the events , a different treatment of the background  @xcite ; + 2 ) the theoretical model for neutrino emission , required for the data analysis , can be improved and approached as much as possible to the real signal expected from the numerical simulations of neutrino emission .",
    "in this respect , a specific criticism was raised by raffelt and mirizzi  @xcite , who emphasized that the two - phase parameterization used in ll analysis leads to a sudden jump of the average neutrino energy while passing from accretion to cooling .",
    "this behavior is rather different from the expectations of the numerical simulations .    in short , our main tasks are to present a somewhat different likelihood , to propose an improved parameterization for neutrino flux , to include oscillations , and finally to evaluate the impact of the various new points for the analysis of sn1987a observations .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following : in sect .",
    "[ likimpr ] we discuss the construction of the likelihood function involved in the analysis of the data set , underlining the improvements carried in the description of detection rate ; in sect .",
    "[ sec : m ] we propose a new parameterization for neutrino emission , building it step by step and discussing its features , leaving the description of certain technical details to the appendix ; finally in sect .",
    "[ sec : r ] we draw the results of our analysis .",
    "in this section we describe the likelihood that we adopted to compare the observed events and the assumed flux for the neutrino emission , stressing the novelties and the technical improvements .      the signal in each detector , triply differential in time ,",
    "positron energy @xmath9 and cosine of the angle @xmath10 between the antineutrino and the positron is : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the number of targets ( = free protons ) in the detectors , @xmath13 is the inverse beta decay cross section ( eq .  [ ibd ] ) , @xmath14 the  detector dependent  average detection efficiency , @xmath15 is the angular bias = 1 for kamiokande - ii and baksan whereas for imb @xmath16  @xcite , and , finally , @xmath17 is the electron antineutrino flux , differential in the antineutrino energy @xmath18 and discussed later in this work .",
    "the expected number of signal events @xmath19 is the crucial ingredient , along with the expected number of background events @xmath20 , to construct the poisson likelihood @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and where @xmath23 is the number of observed events . to evaluate @xmath19 we use eq .",
    "[ seta ] : the number of expected signals in a bin is just @xmath24 ; the total number of the events is the integral of @xmath25 over its three variables .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , our analysis is similar to the one of lamb and loredo @xcite , with whom we agree within errors when we strictly stick to their procedure .",
    "the signal rate that we adopted in this paper departs from their one in the following points :      we adopt the inverse beta decay cross section calculated in @xcite and in particular we use the differential expression @xmath26 given in eq .",
    "( 20 ) of that paper .",
    "the energy of antineutrino is given in terms of the positron energy @xmath9 and of the angle @xmath10 between the antineutrino and the positron directions : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the positron momentum .",
    "the new total cross section agrees at 10 mev with the one used by lamb and loredo , whereas at 20 mev ( 30 mev ) it is 6% ( 12% ) smaller .      following the traditional approach and differently from  @xcite we include in eq .  [ seta ] the detection efficiency as a function of the true energy of the event .",
    "a formal justification of our procedure is given in @xcite , that is in contrast with the formal justification in appendix a of @xcite .",
    "our procedure simply accounts for the evident fact that the expected number of _ signal _ events @xmath19 should include all relevant detector dependent features : loss of events due to light attenuation , fluctuations of the number of photoelectrons , detector geometry , _ etc._. these features produce an imperfect ( @xmath30 ) detection efficiency , that means that only a fraction of the produced positrons is actually detected .",
    "we have in mind an _ average efficiency _",
    "evaluated by a mc procedure , namely 1 )  simulating several events with true energy @xmath9 but located in the various positions and emitted in all possible directions , then 2 )  counting the fraction of times that an event is recorded , finally 3 )  deducing also the ` smearing ' ( = average error as a function of  @xmath9 ) .",
    "it is possible to argue in favor of our procedure by considering the following situation .",
    "imagine two detectors that differ by the detector efficiency : @xmath31 in the first one , @xmath32 in the second , and with a rate of positron production equal to the background rate .",
    "suppose that each of these detectors observed one event .",
    "according to the procedure of @xcite ( used , e.g. , to obtain their tab .",
    "vi ) the probability that the observed event is due to a signal is 50% in both detectors , that we find paradoxical : the better the detector , the higher should be the chances of a signal . instead , adopting our procedure , the probability that the event is due to a signal is 50% in the first detector and 9% in the second one , which we find more plausible .",
    "we recall ( in agreement with @xcite ) that for an even more refined analysis of the data , one should not use the average detection efficiency , but should rather evaluate the specific detection efficiency and background rate for any individual event . in our understanding , a correction on individual basis of this type was performed only to assess the errors on the energies of the events , see  @xcite .",
    "we estimate the theoretical parameters by the @xmath33 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the likelihood of any detector ( @xmath36 are shorthands for kamiokande - ii , imb , baksan ) .",
    "we use poisson statistics ; dropping constant ( irrelevant ) factors , the ` unbinned ' likelihood of each of the 3 detectors is : @xmath37 \\times \\left [ \\frac{b_i}{2 } + \\ ! \\int\\!\\ !",
    "r(t_i , e_e , \\cos\\theta_i ) { \\cal l}_i(e_e ) de_e \\right ] .",
    "\\label{liky } \\end{array}\\ ] ] we denote by @xmath38 the integral of @xmath25 over the variables @xmath9 and @xmath39 . in imb , the live - time fraction is @xmath40 and the dead - time is @xmath41  s , whereas for the other detectors @xmath42 and @xmath43 each detector saw @xmath44 events ; their time , energy and cosine with supernova direction are called @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "@xmath49 is a gaussian distribution that includes the estimated values of the energy @xmath46 and the error of the energy @xmath50 for each individual event , accounting for the detector - dependent effects on energy measurements .",
    "the inclusion of the error on the measurement of @xmath39 does not change significantly the likelihood , so we simply set @xmath51 for each event . is measured ; we set instead @xmath52 for the 5 events of baksan and the last 4 events ( out of 16 ) of kamiokande - ii .",
    "] finally , we do not include an error on the event times @xmath53 , since the relative time of each event is precisely measured .",
    "the absolute times have not been measured precisely enough ( except for imb ) .",
    "however , the procedure of analysis that we adopt requires only the relative times between the events : the experimental input is @xmath54 .",
    "the times @xmath45 are defined as follows : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the offset ( or delay ) time between the first neutrino that reached the earth ( that , by definition , occurred at @xmath57 ) and the first event that was detected .",
    "we introduce one parameter @xmath58 for each detector , and fit their values from the data .",
    "the integral over the time in the first exponential factor of eq .",
    "[ liky ] is performed from the moment when the first neutrino reaches the earth till the end of data taking , @xmath59  s ; the condition that all the data are included imposes mild restrictions , such as @xmath60 s , that do not have a relevant role in the analysis .",
    "the probability that an event is due to background is denoted by @xmath61 in eq .",
    "it is calculated as @xmath62 : @xmath61 is the _ measured _ background rate for the given energy [ hz / mev ] .",
    "the background distribution differential in time , energy and cosine is @xmath63 ; the factor @xmath64 describes a uniform cosine distribution .",
    "this definition is different from the one of ll , @xmath65 , that has been argued to be inaccurate in @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath61 that we use for kamiokande - ii are given in appendix a of @xcite .",
    "the events of kamiokande below 7 mev have a higher background rate than found by ll , those above 9 mev a lower background rate , while the other ones stay almost unchanged .",
    "the changes for baksan are instead negligible .",
    "it is fair to assume in good approximation that , in the time window of interest , imb observations are safe against background contamination .",
    "in this section we describe the parameterization of the neutrino flux that we adopt .",
    "we describe the signal introducing three ` microscopic ' ( i.e. , physically meaningful ) parameters for each phase , that , roughly speaking , are needed to quantify the duration of the emission process , the intensity of the emission and the average energy of the antineutrinos .",
    "the adopted time distributions are constructed to enforce the continuity of the instantaneous luminosity and of the average energy as found in the numerical simulations .",
    "moreover , we tried to maintain the parameterization as simple as possible .        in the last phase of the sn collapse the nascent proto - neutron star evolves in a hot neutron star ( with radius @xmath66 ) and this process is characterized by a neutrinos and antineutrinos flux of all species .",
    "this is the _ cooling _ phase ; we use the suffix _ c _ in the corresponding symbols .",

    "[ we use the symbol @xmath71 rather than @xmath72 to emphasize that flavor oscillations have not been included yet ] .",
    "the astrophysical free parameters are @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 namely : the radius of the emitting region ( neutrino sphere ) , the initial temperature , and the time constant of the process .",
    "we recall which are the generic expectations : @xmath76  km , @xmath77  mev , and @xmath78few - many seconds .",
    "rather than using these _ a priori _ , we will deduce the value of these parameters by fitting the sn1987a data , and later , we will compare the results with the expectations .",
    "after the bounce , the simulations indicate that the shock wave , propagating into the outer core of the star , looses energy and eventually gets stalled .",
    "it forms an accreting shock that encloses a region of dissociated matter and hot @xmath79 plasma , where the weak reactions of eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] give rise to intense @xmath5 and @xmath6 luminosities .",
    "this emission lasts a fraction of a second . in the appendix",
    "we describe in more details the conceptual scheme for @xmath6 emission : a neutron target exposed to a flux of thermal positrons .",
    "the neutrons are treated as a transparent target , for only a small fraction of antineutrinos is expected to couple with the star .",
    "this is the _ accretion _ phase ; we use the suffix _ a _ in the corresponding symbols .",

    "[ flusso ] and [ appra ] is given in the appendix .",
    "the average energy of the antineutrinos is roughly given by @xmath86 and the spectrum is slightly non - thermal , increases ; e.g. , for @xmath87 the pinching factor is 4.2 . ]",
    "mostly due to the presence of the cross section @xmath88 .",
    "for example , when @xmath89 mev , we get @xmath90 respectively and @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "another manifestation that the distribution is non - thermal is the scaling of the luminosity with the temperature , roughly as @xmath93different from the thermal scaling @xmath94 . in order to give some feeling of the antineutrino emission ,",
    "if we suppose that at @xmath57 we have @xmath95  mev and @xmath96 ( see just below for a precise definition of these quantities ) we get a luminosity of @xmath97 erg / s ; the same luminosity and average energy would be given by a black body distribution with @xmath98  mev and @xmath99  km .",
    "there are two time dependent quantities in eq .",
    "[ flusso ] : the number of neutrons @xmath81 and the positron temperature @xmath100 .",
    "it is straightforward to introduce a temperature that interpolates from an initial value to a final value : @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes the _ positron _ temperature at the beginning of accretion ( to be contrasted with @xmath74 , the _ antineutrino _ temperature at the beginning of the cooling phase ) . with this parametrization",
    ", the positron temperature reaches @xmath103 at @xmath104 , that is what is needed match the average antineutrino energies , namely , to ensure a continuous behavior of the average antineutrino energy ( in particular at the end of the accretion phase and at the beginning of the cooling phase ) .",
    "the power @xmath105 mimics the behavior found in numerical simulations ; we adopt @xmath106 as a default value .",
    "now we discuss the time evolution of the number of neutrons exposed to positrons @xmath81 , proportional to the luminosity in accretion .",
    "our goal would be a luminosity that , at least for @xmath107 , decreases as @xmath108 .",
    "this behavior is suggested by the numerical simulations and is advocated by ll @xcite .",
    "however , when we allow the temperature to vary , we vary also the luminosity , that scales as @xmath109 .",
    "thus , we need to include an explicit factor @xmath110 .",
    "we arrive at our prescription for the number of neutrons exposed to thermal positrons : @xmath111 the fraction of neutrons being set to @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath113 is the initial accreting mass exposed to the positrons thermal flux .",
    "the time - dependent factor @xmath114 , \\label{jcut}\\ ] ] is included to terminate the accretion phase at @xmath115 .",
    "ll use @xmath116 , which however leads to a very sharp drop of the luminosity at @xmath115 . in our calculations",
    ", we will set instead @xmath117 , a choice that offers the advantage of leading to a smooth ( reasonable , continuous ) luminosity curve , closer to the type of curves found in numerical simulations .",
    "[ we will show in the next section luminosity curves with @xmath116 and with @xmath117 . ]",
    "ultimately , the accretion phase involves 3 free parameters : @xmath113 , @xmath102 and @xmath118 , the same number of parameters of the cooling phase .",
    "finally , we give rather generic expectations on values of these parameters : @xmath113 is certainly lower than the whole outer core mass ( about @xmath119 ) ; @xmath102 is expected to sit in the few mev range ; and , finally , the accretion should last a fraction of a second , @xmath120  s being a typical number .      in the model advocated by lamb and loredo and adopted for the analysis of sn1987a data , the accretion and",
    "the cooling phases are contemporaneous .",
    "this has the consequence that for times @xmath121 , the antineutrino distribution is not a thermal spectrum , but a composition ( = sum ) of two thermal spectra , whose average energies differ by more than a factor of 2 in the best - fit point . at low energies ,",
    "the spectrum is dominated by the antineutrinos from accretion ; at the highest energies , by the antineutrinos from cooling . the possibility to have a _",
    "composite spectrum _ implies , among the other things , that it is easy ( trivial ) to reconcile the low energy events observed by kamiokande - ii and the high energy events observed by imb in the first second : they simply belong to different and simultaneous phases of emission .",
    "we will verify this statement later by a straightforward calculation  see tab .",
    "[ tabp2 ] .",
    "we note in passing that such a composite spectrum is used in the work of loredo and lamb @xcite but this characteristic feature is neither commented or discussed there .",
    "the compositeness of the ll spectrum ( i.e. , the non - thermal tail ) can be better perceived plotting it in logarithmic scale and/or by considering the time - integrated spectrum , see fig .  2 of @xcite .",
    "however , at the best of our knowledge there is no evidence from numerical simulations of a composite behavior of the spectrum ; the instantaneous @xmath6 spectrum is found to be quasi - thermal at any time and typically this property is shared also by the time - integrated spectrum ; see , e.g. , the discussions in @xcite . deviations from a thermal distribution are observed , especially during accretion @xcite ; they can be effectively described by a ` pinching ' parameter of the order of a few , that means that the high - energy tail of the spectrum is depleted  not enhanced as for the composite model advocated by ll .    in short , we believe that , in absence of an explicit indication from numerical simulations , the model that should be adopted in data analyses ( and/or the null - hypothesis that should be tested ) is the simplest one compatible with the numerical simulations , namely : a @xmath6 spectrum quasi - thermal at any time  rather than , e.g. , ` composite ' @xcite , bimodal @xcite or exponentially decreasing in the energy @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "we parameterize the antineutrino flux as follows : @xmath122 where @xmath123 ( resp . , @xmath124 )",
    "is given in eq .",
    "[ flusso ] ( resp . , eq .  [ fluso ] ) in the case when oscillations are absent .",
    "recalling that @xmath125 appears explicitly in eq .",
    "[ nnbest ] , i.e. , in the accretion flux , it is clear that the effect of this function is simply to interpolate between the two phases of neutrino emission ; in other words , the cooling phase begins around @xmath104 .",
    "we note here a limit in which the likelihood becomes unphysical .",
    "consider the case when only the first event detected by kamiokande - ii falls in the accretion phase . if the accretion were to last a very short amount of time , @xmath126 , and if @xmath127  s , the antineutrino flux at the time of the first event @xmath128 could become very large even if the number of expected number of events remains small . in this limit , the interaction rate in eq .",
    "[ seta ] becomes large , too .",
    "thus , due to the factor @xmath129 in eq .",
    "[ liky ] , the likelihood can be made arbitrarily large , because the exponential factor in the same equation ( that depends on the expected number of events ) will not change much .",
    "the way to avoid this pitfall is to require a lower limit on @xmath118 in the numerical calculations .",
    "a limit that is adequate for the analysis of data from sn1987a is @xmath130 s. we will demonstrate explicitly the presence of this unphysical behavior of the likelihood function later , when discussing its maxima .      here",
    "we discuss the effects of neutrino oscillations on the observed @xmath6 fluxes .",
    "the survival probability @xmath131 for @xmath132 emitted by supernova is dictated by two different interactions with the star medium .",
    "the first is the usual matter effect @xcite of charged current interactions between @xmath6 and the electrons of the matter .",
    "the second is the effect of @xmath133 interactions  @xcite , that is known to be important in specific cases @xcite and whose behavior has been quantified in certain approximations  @xcite . in order to describe oscillations we have to distinguish the two arrangements of the neutrino mass spectrum that are compatible with the present knowledge of neutrino properties ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : for * normal * mass hierarchy the survival probability and the observed @xmath6 flux are : @xmath134 \\phi_{\\bar\\nu_e}= p\\ \\phi_{\\bar\\nu_e}^0 + ( 1-p)\\ \\phi_{\\bar\\nu_\\mu}^0,\\\\ \\end{array } \\label{normal}\\ ] ] where we recall that @xmath71 is the flux in absence of oscillations .",

    "the earth matter effect is known to be small ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we include it in the analysis anyway evaluating the survival probabilities with the prem model  @xcite .",
    "+ in the case of normal mass hierarchy the probability @xmath141 is reliably predicted and rather precisely known . instead , for inverted mass hierarchy , @xmath131 depends strongly on the unknown mixing angle @xmath142 .",
    "in fact , the flip probability @xmath143 ( that quantifies the loss of adiabaticity at the ` resonance ' related to the atmospheric @xmath144 ) is : @xmath145 , \\label{peffe}\\ ] ] where the numerical value corresponds to the supernova profile @xmath146 given in @xcite .",
    "the predictions for the @xmath132 flux in the detector could be tested with a relatively large amount of data : a galactic supernova could turn out to be useful to discriminate the right mass hierarchy .",
    "we assume that an equal amount of energy goes in each species ( equipartition hypothesis ) during cooling .",
    "furthermore , we suppose that the temperature of @xmath147 and @xmath148 is in a fixed ratio with the @xmath132 temperature . following  @xcite",
    "we assume : @xmath149 we tested that a value in the 1.0 - 1.5 or a deviation of the amount of energy stored in non - electronic neutrino species by a factor of 2 does not affect crucially the fitted antineutrino flux . in the accretion phase , we will suppose that only @xmath5 and @xmath132 are emitted in equal amount , whereas @xmath150 .",
    "the fit provides a reasonably fair description of the antineutrino flux anyway , but the estimation of the amount of energy emitted during accretion should be considered as a lower bound .",
    "in the previous two sections we constructed , step by step , a likelihood function that represents the probability function of the overall data set . this probability varies in the parameters space and depends on the model for the antineutrino emission .",
    "as anticipated , the main goal of this paper is to verify if the best - fit values of the parameters , that maximize the likelihood function , are physically acceptable .",
    "we remark that ll adopted a bayesian analysis while we use a frequentist approach , which occasionally leads to some difference in the confidence levels , but not in the best fit points . more specifically to calculate the error on one parameter we use as a rule the profile likelihood , namely the likelihood evaluated fixing the parameter of interest and maximizing the other ( nuisance ) parameters .",
    "a similar procedure allows us to calculate the confidence regions .",

    "<S> we propose a new parameterization of the antineutrino flux from core collapse supernovae , that allows an interpretation of its astrophysical parameters within the bethe and wilson scenario for the explosion , and that leads to a reasonable ( smooth ) behavior of the average energy and of the luminosity curve . </S>",
    "<S> we apply it to analyze the events observed by kamiokande - ii , imb and baksan detectors in correlation with sn1987a . for the first time </S>",
    "<S> , we consider in the same analysis all data characteristics : times , energies and angles of the observed events . </S>",
    "<S> we account for the presence of background and evaluate the impact of neutrino oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> the hypothesis that the initial luminous phase of emission ( accretion ) is absent can be rejected at the 2% significance level . without the need to impose external priors in the likelihood analysis , the best - fit values of the astrophysical parameters are found to be in remarkable agreement with the expectations of the standard core - collapse scenario ; in particular , the electron antineutrino - sphere radius is 16 km , the duration of the accretion phase is found to be @xmath0 s , and the initial accreting mass is 0.22 @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly the total energy emitted in neutrinos is @xmath2 erg , again close to the expectations . </S>",
    "<S> the errors on the parameters are evaluated and found to be relatively large , consistently with the limited number of detected events ; the two dimensional confidence regions , that demonstrate the main correlations between the parameters , are also given . </S>"
