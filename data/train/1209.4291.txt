    "successful operation of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern is resulting in rich harvest of experimental data .",
    "even more data at higher energy and with higher statistics will be available over the next two decades from the lhc experiments .",
    "one of the challenges in the proper understanding and interpretation of these data , possibly leading to discovery of new phenomena , will be perfect mastering of the `` trivial '' effects due to multiple emission of soft and collinear gluons and quarks .",
    "perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd )  @xcite , together with the clever modelling of low energy nonperturbative effects , will be the basic and indispensable tool for disentangling the standard model physics component in the data .",
    "most of the methodology used in this work is described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the following",
    ", additional details relevant for monte carlo ( mc ) implementation and tests are described .",
    "let us start with a description of the initial condition of the forward evolution ( necessary in the mc implementation ) which was omitted in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the proper understanding of this implementation it is necessary to recall some basic facts about the use of maximum rapidity of emitted partons ( angular ordering ) as the evolution time variable .",
    "while the energy of the emitted gluon is a natural variable to handle infrared singularities , the angular variable is best suited for controlling collinear singularities .",
    "the logarithm of the angle of the emitted gluon ( rapidity ) with respect to the _ emitter parton _ emerging from the initial hadron , is a natural `` master variable '' for modelling collinear singularities .",
    "the angular variable is also well suited for modeling the structure of the non - abelian soft limit ( colour coherence )  @xcite .",
    "conversely , a hard process in deep inelastic lepton - hadron scattering ( dis ) or drell - yan ( dy ) process acting as a `` probe '' , either backscattering ( in the breit frame for dis ) or absorbing ( into a heavy boson in dy ) the emitter parton , in a well defined rest frame of the hard process ( rfhp ) , has its own energy scale used also as a master variable in collinear factorization and renormalization group equations .",
    "more precisely , for the hard process with the center - of - mass energy @xmath0 ( @xmath1 in the dy process ) , the parton entering hard process has energy equal @xmath2 . on the other hand , in the same rfhp , the initial hadron energy is @xmath3 and the bjorken variable is the ratio @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is invariant with respect to boosts along the emitter direction ) .",
    "the luminosity distribution of this parton @xmath6 is commonly referred to as parton distribution function , pdf in short .",
    "it is weakly dependent on @xmath0 and is measured experimentally at each value of @xmath0 separately , that is at a given value of @xmath0 varying the energy @xmath7 of the initial hadron seen in rfhp .",
    "the important practical question for monte carlo modelling of the emission of the collinear gluons is : how to relate the variable @xmath8 governing the `` evolution '' of the pdf in the traditional dglap schemes such as @xmath9 scheme , and the rapidity variable of emitted gluons ?    in the following , to answer the above question we shall consider for simplicity the lo case with non - running @xmath10 , and for pure gluonstrahlung ( non - singlet qed - like component of pdf ) from a _",
    "single emitter_. for the mc purpose , we define the evolution variable @xmath11 as a hypervelocity of the lorentz boost from the initial beam hadron rest frame to rfhp , @xmath12 ( or equivalently , the hypervelocity of the beam hadron in the rfhp ) . for each emitted gluon",
    "we define the rapidity @xmath13 in the rest frame of the initial hadron , or @xmath14 in rfhp .",
    "next , we require in the context of pqcd description of the gluonstrahlung that @xmath15 in the rfhp ( in the initial hadron frame @xmath16 ) . in other words , @xmath12 is a limiting rapidity for emitted gluons ( or @xmath17 ) .",
    "of course , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is hadron mass and @xmath20 .",

    ", experiments a and b will use different rfhps , connected by the lorentz boost of the hypervelocity @xmath27 .    what is now the difference between the more traditional choice of the evolution time variable @xmath28 of dglap and our preferred definition @xmath29 ( maximum rapidity of the emitted gluons ) ? when comparing two experiments with hard probes at the scales @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath30 , while more phase - space conscious @xmath31 .",
    "the `` offset '' @xmath32 is formally of the nlo class term in the evolution kernel . ] and can be neglected within the lo approximation , hence both choices are equally good at lo level .",
    "however , the use of ( angular ) @xmath11 assures the completeness of the phase space of the emitted gluon , no gaps ( nor `` dead zones '' ) , so it is the preferred choice in the mc modelling , aiming at the nlo level evolution in the next steps .",
    "additionally , the parallel use of @xmath33 is quite useful and essential for other purposes , like introduction of the running @xmath10 , etc .    in particular , @xmath34 is more natural for defining the initial point of the forward evolution ( the stopping rule in the backward evolution ) . in order to assure the validity of pqcd it is required that the energy scale of the probe @xmath35 is reasonably above the non - perturbative scales , like @xmath36gev , at the above initial point",
    "this leads to the initial forward evolution point at @xmath37 and @xmath38 , as implemented in the following mc .",
    "in other words , gluons with rapidities below @xmath39 are regarded as `` unresolved '' , i.e. @xmath40 is a maximum rapidity for all unresolved gluons .",

    "the fact that the nlo correction dies out towards the ir limit @xmath130 is not guaranteed in the collinear factorization .",
    "it results from the conscious choice that our lo differential distributions reproduce the correct ir limit not only in lo but also in nlo and in the entire phase space .",
    "another important point is the completeness of the phase space near the ( @xmath126 , @xmath129 ) phase space corner .",

    "[ fig : mcrho1glulo_nlo ] ) is non - negligible .",
    "this is exactly the observation on which powheg technique is built ! moreover , as noticed by the powheg authors , taking the @xmath135 component is sufficient to reproduce the complete nlo correction ( up to nnlo ) .",
    "let us check numerically the above statements by means of comparing the nlo correction to the @xmath139 distribution from @xmath131 and from @xmath140 .",
    "this comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mccanv8k ] . as we see",
    "the @xmath135 component saturates the entire sum very well , whereas the @xmath141 component is quite small .",
    "a natural question is : why bother to keep the entire sum instead of taking only the @xmath135 contribution ?",
    "in fact we can , which is valuable feature of our scheme .",
    "however , we stress that in the powheg scheme the @xmath135 gluon is generated in the mc separately in the first step and other gluons are generated ( by the lo parton shower mc ) in the next step .",
    "this is fine and easy if the lo mc uses @xmath137-ordering , while in case of the lo mc with angular / rapidity - ordering additional effort of generating the so called vetoed showers and truncated showers is needed in the powheg method . in our method , the angular ordering is used but the vetoed / truncated showers are not needed , even if we replace the sum @xmath131 by @xmath135 component @xmath142 .",
    "is there any rationale for keeping the sum over gluons in nlo weight at all ?",
    "there are two reasons for keeping it , at least optionally : ( a ) the valuable crosscheck of the nlo mc against the simple collinear formula of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyanxch ] ) is exact only if we keep the sum , ( b ) it may turn out that keeping the sum reduces missing nnlo corrections . in our opinion",
    "one should keep both versions and check which one better fits the complete nnlo or better agrees with additional resummations beyond lo .    as an additional illustration for the above discussion , in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcrhoordlo ] we show the distribution of gluons ordered in rapidity , starting from the gluon with the maximum rapidity , the closest to hard process . as we see",

    "it is important to notice that the width of this ridge goes to zero when @xmath145 in the ir cut - off @xmath146 .",
    "hence , sooner or later the gluon with the highest @xmath69 will not be able to reproduce / saturate the gluon distribution in the nlo corner close to hard process , and the nlo correction will be highly incomplete . in the @xmath137-ordering",
    "this is not the case , of course .    in the above",
    ", we have mainly discussed the differences of our mc with the powheg method in which , similarly to our case , the negative mc weight is not allowed .",
    "the mc@nlo method roughly corresponds to generating in a separate mc branch events according to non - positive nlo correcting distribution . in the same mc branch ,",
    "events filling the empty phase space near the hard process corner are also added .",
    "both mc@nlo and powheg feature the @xmath121 components in the nlo corrections , which are the source of the practical complications there , while they are absent in our approach . in mc@nlo and powheg case",
    "these @xmath121 corrections act effectively as the `` in - flight '' translation of the pdfs from the @xmath9 collinear factorization scheme ( fs ) to the fs used effectively in the mc , ( see ref .",

    "can be also applied for introducing the nlo corrections in the middle of the ladder  @xcite , it is an interesting question whether limiting the sum @xmath131 to one ( or two ) terms would / could be used in order to upgrade the qcd evolution in the parton shower to the complete nlo level , which would open many new promising avenues in the development of the high quality qcd parton shower mcs for lhc and other colliders .",

    "the present choice of the rapidity boundary @xmath75 is good at the lo level , and it also correctly reproduces the integrated nlo cross sention .",

    "the best choice is to identify @xmath74 with the rest system of the heavy boson and the hardest gluon @xmath148 .",
    "this can be easily obtained by means of refining the mapping @xmath149 in such a way that it is used twice .",
    "for the first time with @xmath75 , then the rapidity @xmath148 is determined and @xmath149 mapping is repeated with @xmath150 . obviously some gluons will be reclassified as belonging to another initial beam ladder .",
    "the above solution was already tested and works correctly .    concerning further refinements on the initial pdf , this issue would be resolved automatically if mc was fitted to the experimental data or if the pdfs have been fitted within the mc scheme .",
    "if the initial pdf is to be taken from a standard library of pdfs in the @xmath9 scheme , then it will be necessary to correct it using the difference of the counterterms of the @xmath9 and mc schemes ( see eq .",
    "( 44 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "from the classic analysis  @xcite of nlo corrections to the dy process , it is known that this correction will be large and dominated by the term @xmath151 , in the region where quark distribution is strongly varying in @xmath5 .",
    "note that in powheg method the above correction is implemented in the mc by means of explicit generation of the variables in the convolution implementing nlo corrections and the corresponding manipulation on four - momenta is done .",
    "in contrast , in our method nlo corrections are included entirely through mc weight and no extra kinematics transformations are needed ( beyond these of the lo mc modelling ) .    in the above context",
    "an interesting numerical results are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite  they illustrate size and location of the @xmath5-variation in pdfs due to kinematics manipulations in powheg driven by nlo corrections . in our method",
    "the entire kinematical modification of the longitudinal parton fraction @xmath5 is due to the lo mapping and shape modification due to the nlo weight .",
    "we expect this effect to be less sizable in our method , but a separate study would be needed to verify it .",
    "a new methodology of adding the qcd nlo corrections to the hard process in the initial state monte carlo parton shower is tested numerically using heavy boson production at hadron - hadron colliders .",
    "the ladder parts of the parton shower are modelled in the lo approximation , also using these new methods .",
    "the presented numerical results prove that the basic concept of the new methodology works correctly in the numerical environment of a monte carlo parton shower .",
    "the differences with the well established methods of mc@nlo and powheg are briefly discussed .",
    "also , possible refinements of the method are indicated .    clearly",
    "the  proof of concept  is successful , and more work is required before practical application will emerge .",
