    "the scalar mesons are one of the most controversial subjects in hadron physics . in the last edition of the pdg@xcite , there were four scalar isoscalars listed below 1.5  gev ( the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with a possible fifth at 1.7  gev , the @xmath7 .",
    "there were also two isovectors listed , the @xmath8 and the @xmath9 .",
    "this is obviously too many for a standard @xmath10 nonet .",
    "however , many qcd - motivated models predict the the existence of non-@xmath10 mesons , such as @xmath11 states@xcite , @xmath12 molecules@xcite and glueballs@xcite . it is precisely in the scalar - isoscalar that these unconventional mesons are most like to be found .",
    "this excess of isoscalars and isovectors has led to the suggestion that there are in fact two scalar nonets@xcite : the conventional one centred around 1.4  gev and an unconventional , possibly @xmath11 , one centred around 1  gev .",
    "however , the pdg lists only one pair of strange scalar mesons in this region , the @xmath13 and so some authors have postulated a light strange meson , known as the @xmath2 evidence for@xcite and against@xcite the @xmath2 has been claimed within various models .",
    "it should be kept in mind that the existence of a resonance is not defined by the ability to fit a particular formula to the experimental data .",
    "a resonance is entirely defined by the presence of a pole of the @xmath14matrix on the nearby unphysical sheet .",
    "i would like to present to you the results of a model - independent calculation@xcite to determine whether the @xmath2 is indeed present in the experimental data by determining the number and positions of the poles of the @xmath14matrix .",
    "the method , due to nagov _",
    "et al_@xcite , does not require the artificial separation of data into background and resonance components and i will begin by briefly outlining it .",
    "to determine the position of a pole in the complex plane from data along the real axis we must perform some form of analytic continuation . in order to maximise the region of validity of our analytic continuation we begin by conformally mapping the unphysical sheet of the @xmath0 partial wave amplitude ( see fig .",
    "[ pwa ] ) into the unit disc .",
    "the mapping is designed so that the cuts in the @xmath15plane are mapped onto the circumference of the circle in the @xmath16plane .",
    "the mapping is accomplished in two steps .",
    "first @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a real number chosen to minimise the distance the continuation must cover . from fig .",
    "[ zcut ] we notice that physical data could never cover the whole circle .",
    "we also see that the proportion of the circle covered by each increment in @xmath19 falls very sharply as @xmath19 increases .",
    "hence we can neglect radial excitations from our analysis .",
    "let @xmath20 and @xmath21 be continuous functions describing the experimental data and errors around the entire circle . if @xmath22 is a square - integrable function around the circle , then we can test how well it describes the data through a @xmath23 defined by @xmath24    we introduce a weight function @xmath25 which we define to be real analytic , non - zero throughout the disc and constrained by @xmath26 around the circle . expanding our data and trial functions as laurent series about the origin ,",
    "i.e. @xmath27 gives @xmath28 the pole structure of our partial wave amplitude , @xmath20 , can then be determined by finding the test function @xmath22 which minimises the first summation in eq .",
    "( [ chi2 ] ) . since partial wave amplitudes",
    "are real analytic , the coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 will be real .    to test if the amplitude is free of resonances we set @xmath31 .",
    "then the quantity will have a @xmath32distribution .    to test",
    "if the amplitude contains one resonance we define @xmath33 @xmath34 is the one resonance blaschke pole killing factor . now",
    "the quantity will have a @xmath32distribution .",
    "the experimental inputs into our calculation are the @xmath0 scattering magnitudes , @xmath35 , and phases , @xmath36 , as measured , for example , by the lass experiment@xcite .",
    "the amplitude is normalised such that @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the centre of mass 3-momentum of the @xmath0 system and the superscript indicates we are on the physical sheet . in order to detect a resonance we must move onto the relevant unphysical sheet , this",
    "is done by swapping the sign of the phase .",
    "after mapping we have discrete data points @xmath39 and errors @xmath40 around a portion of the circle . where the data is more densely packed the amplitude is more tightly controlled , so we weight the errors by the density of data points in that region , i.e. we define @xmath41 .    between threshold and the start of the data we use the lass effective range fit to create a few guide points .",
    "in the unphysical region we simply guess a few widely spaced guide points and assign large errors .",
    "the large spacing and errors will hopefully deweight these points so that they do not unduly affect the results of the calculation . with these three different inputs and using the schwarz reflection principle",
    "we can cover the circle with data and then we interpolate to give the continuous functions that we need .",
    "a suitable form for the weight function is @xmath42 where the @xmath43 can be found from a fourier cosine fit to @xmath44 .",
    "we can now calculate the singular coefficients of our laurent expansions in the usual way , i.e. @xmath45    we want to find the value of @xmath46 that minimises @xmath47 and then compare the final value with @xmath48 .",
    "we can carry out a similar procedure to test for two resonances and by comparing the various @xmath23 s we can determine the number of resonances present in the channel .",
    "in order to assess its capabilities , we began by testing the method explained previously with a trial scattering amplitude .",
    "this amplitude was created using jost functions and had two resonances present , a @xmath49 with mass 900  mev and width 500  gev and a @xmath50 with mass 1400  mev and width 300  mev .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ jost ] .",
    "we can see clearly that the @xmath23 falls significantly as the number of resonances is increased and that changing the size of the errors in the unphysical region has very little effect on either of the pole positions obtained .",
    "thus we can confidently claim that the amplitude contains two resonances and furthermore the parameters of these resonances have been quite accurately determined .",
    ".__pole positions and @xmath23 s for model data .",
    "the two options differ only in the size of the errors in the unphysical region . _ _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     turning now to experimental data , table  [ lass ] shows the results obtained from the lass total s - wave data .",
    "we see that the fall in @xmath23 in going from one to two resonances is negligible compared to the fall between zero and one resonance .",
    "also the parameters for the second resonance are quite sensitive to the size of the errors in the unphysical region .",
    "this suggests that the second resonance listed in table  [ lass ] is merely an artifact of looking for two poles and is not really present in the data .",
    "in this talk i have tried to outline a calculation to determine the number of resonances present in strange scalar channel .",
    "this method is most sensitive to lighter resonances and is capable of identifying two resonances in a channel even when they are broad and overlapping .",
    "the experimental @xmath0 scattering data is found to contain only one resonance below 1.8  gev and this state is readily identifiable with the @xmath1 .",
    "there is no evidence for a @xmath2 ."
