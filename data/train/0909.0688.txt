    "gas comprises 99% of the mass of primordial disks . as time increases ,",
    "it is accreted onto the star , formed into planets , and lost by photoevaporation , leaving behind a debris disk , in which most of the mass is locked into planets and other solid bodies traced by secondary dust arising from collisions .",
    "although the general outline of this process is agreed upon , many specific questions remain unanswered , mainly because the gas is difficult to observe . as a result , only @xmath01% of the disk mass ,",
    "the dust , has been used as a probe of the disk evolution . however , although interconnected , the evolution of gas and dust may take different paths @xcite , making observations of the gas itself necessary to understand these processes .",
    "of particular importance are observations of the gas in the inner disk , because it sets the chemical and physical conditions for planet formation .",
    "the bulk of the gas in these cold disks is in 2 , which lacks a permanent dipole component , so the pure rotational and rovibrational lines are weak .",
    "nonetheless , extensive surveys of these lines in primordial disks have been carried out ( bary et al .",
    "2008 ; bitner et al . 2008 , and references therein ) , and they have been detected in a handful of objects .",
    "searches using less abundant molecules have also succeeded and provided information on the gas in the inner region of gas - rich disks @xcite .",
    "gas has also been searched for in disks of more evolved sources which are no longer accreting , within the age range when the transition from primordial to debris is supposed to happen , @xmath35 - 20 myr . in particular , @xcite looked for 2 in the disks of several non - accreting sources and found that the amount of gas still present at 5 - 20 myr is not large enough to form the gas giant planets at that time .",
    "this observation agrees with results indicating that the amount of hot gas in disks of non - accreting sources is decreased when compared to accreting sources @xcite .",
    "uv observations are very promising for detecting the gas .",
    "the strong stellar ly@xmath4 radiation bathes the uv thin regions of the circumstellar material and , as long as the 2 has a temperature of a few thousand degrees , the line excites electrons to upper electronic states , which produces a plethora of emission lines in the uv when they de - excite ( * ? ? ? * h06 , and references therein ) . at the same time , the stellar high energy radiation fields eject electrons from heavy metals , and the resulting free electrons produce additional electrons by ionizing h and he atoms ; these secondary electrons then excite 2 to upper levels , resulting in a characteristic spectrum of lines and continuum in the uv ( * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* b0 ) . for electron excitation to work efficiently , temperatures need to be high enough for neutral h to be present .",
    "the relatively high temperature requirements mean that the 2 detected by these means must either to be close to the star or to be excited by shocks .",
    "uv 2 emission has been found to be extended in objects surrounded by substantial natal material , in the regions where the stellar outflow shocks this material , or in fast accretors , where the 2 may arise in the high density outflow itself ( h06 ) .",
    "however , without remnant envelopes such as the objects in this study , the only known exception being t tau , the most likely place to find the required high temperatures is in the inner disk .",
    "this makes the uv 2 emission ideal for probing the 2 gas in the innermost regions of disks , regions which are difficult to access by other means .",
    "we obtained acs / sbc prism spectra of a fair number of accreting classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) , non - accreting weak t tauri stars ( wtts ) , and more evolved disks ( dd ) , covering the interesting age range , @xmath01 - 100 myr .",
    "our goal was to search for uv 2 emission and study its evolution .",
    "the poor spectral resolution of the acs spectra made the identification of ly@xmath4 fluorescent lines impossible .",
    "however , we were able to identify a feature around @xmath5  , first proposed by b04 as due mostly to electron impact excitation of 2 .",
    "in this letter we present and analyze these spectra .",
    "we show that the 2 feature is absent in all non - accreting and evolved stars while present in all accreting stars , and use uv fluxes to give very rough estimates of upper limits for the remaining surface density of 2 in the latter .",
    "we obtained observations of 20 ctts and 10 non - accreting and evolved targets using the advanced camera for surveys solar blind channel ( acs / sbc ) on the hubble space telescope in 2007 .",
    "the observations were obtained in go programs 10810 ( pi : bergin ) , 10840 ( pi : calvet ) and 11199 ( pi : hartmann ) . each acs observation consists of a brief image in the f165lp filter and a longer image obtained with the pr130l prism .",
    "images appear unresolved .",
    "offsets between the target location in the filter and prism image , including the wavelength solution , were obtained from @xcite .",
    "the target spectrum was then extracted from a 41-pixel ( 1.3  ) wide extraction window .",
    "background count rates of 0.05 - 0.1 counts  s@xmath6 were calculated from offset windows and subtracted from the extracted spectrum .",
    "the absolute wavelength solution was then determined by fitting the bright @xmath7   doublet .",
    "fluxes were calibrated from the sensitivity function obtained from white dwarf standard stars by @xcite . the spectra range from 12301900   with a 2-pixel resolution of @xmath8 at 1230  and @xmath9 at 1600  ",
    ".    table [ tabprop ] lists the acs targets used in this analysis and the properties of these objects .",
    "the ctts sources include 16 objects in the taurus - auriga molecular cloud and four sources in the 25 ori aggregate in the orion ob1a subassociation .",
    "spectral types for the ctts in taurus are from @xcite , and ages from @xcite .",
    "to correct for reddening we used the law towards the star hd 29647 @xcite and estimated @xmath10 by de - reddening the median photometry of @xcite to fit the fluxes of a standard star in the region of the spectrum ( v to j bands ) where the emission is mostly photospheric .",
    "we obtained accretion luminosities @xmath11 for the taurus sources using the u band excesses following @xcite , and the median u from photometry in @xcite .",
    "the ages , spectral types , luminosities , @xmath10 s , and @xmath11 for the sources in 25 ori were taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the non - accreting sources ( wtts / dd ) were selected to have no evidence of accretion and to have excesses in either spitzer space telescope infrared spectrograph ( irs ) spectra or 24 and 70 @xmath12 m multiband imaging photometer ( mips ) photometry , indicating the presence of debris disks .",
    "the sources in the tw hydrae association have been identified as wtts by spectral observations which showed h@xmath4 in emission @xcite and strong li 6707 in absorption @xcite .",
    "the wtts / dd and their properties were discussed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "examples of the acs target spectra are shown in figure [ spectra ] .",
    "we supplemented the acs data with previously published medium and high resolution stis data of ctts ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the source properties , listed in table [ tabprop ] , were taken from @xcite for the orion molecular cloud sources , and derived as described for the acs taurus sources for the stis taurus sources .",
    "we adopt the spectral type and age from @xcite and @xmath10 from @xcite for tw hya .",
    "accretion luminosities for the stis sample were taken from @xcite and ingleby et al .",
    "following b04 , we identified a feature in the stis spectra at 1600  which is due mostly to electron impact 2 emission . due to the low resolution of the acs spectra",
    ", we used the high resolution spectrum of tw hya @xcite to identify this feature in the acs spectra ; in figure [ smtw ] we compare the feature in the observed stis spectrum of tw hya and in the stis spectrum smoothed to the resolution of the acs spectra . while the 2 lines are no longer observable in the smoothed spectrum , the feature at 1600  is .",
    "in addition to electron impact 2 emission , the flux at 1600  has contributions from accretion shock emission and ly@xmath4 fluorescent lines ( ingleby et al .",
    "attempting to isolate an indicator that is due to electron impact 2 emission , we measured the flux between 1575 and 1625  and subtracted from it the continuum and the contribution from nearby strong lines ( he ii 1640  and c iv 1550  ) . since it is unclear how strong the emission from additional sources is at 1600  , we calculated the continuum in three ways .",
    "first , by joining the troughs in the spectrum on either side of the 1600  feature ; second , by fitting a 5th order polynomial to the entire fuv spectrum ; third , by adopting a continuum which assumes that the rise in the spectrum at 1600  is due entirely to electron impact 2 emission .",
    "figure [ smtw ] shows the location of the subtracted continuum for each method in tw hya , and figure [ four ] shows examples of the measurements for three acs targets .",
    "these three methods for measuring the 2 feature luminosity were used to estimate the errors . comparing",
    "the tw hya spectra at both resolutions indicates that the feature luminosity decreases by @xmath02 in the low resolution spectrum because some of the flux is blended into the continuum .",
    "this error is small compared to the uncertainty in the continuum location .    using these procedures ,",
    "we measured the luminosity of the 1600  feature in both the acs spectra and the stis spectra smoothed to the resolution of acs ; the feature luminosities are given in table 1 .",
    "for the wtts / dd , we find that the 2 feature is not observable and the values presented in table 1 are upper limits based on the rms fluctuations from 1575 to 1625  . we thus find that the 2 feature shows only in the accreting sources .",
    "this is not an age effect ; our sample includes ctts and wtts of similar age at @xmath010 myr ( left panel of figure [ h2age ] ) but only the accreting sources show the 2 feature .",
    "moreover , we find a clear correlation of the strength of the feature with @xmath11 in the ctts ( right panel of figure [ h2age ] ) , with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0.68 , indicating that the 2 emission depends on the accretion properties of the source and not on the age .",
    "a similar result was found in @xcite , where the probability of detecting near - ir 2 lines was greater in sources with higher accretion rates .",
    "free electrons are required for the process of electron excitation to be effective (  1 ) . since , in turn , high energy radiation fields are necessary to produce fast electrons , the absence of 2 emission in the wtts / dd could in principle be due to a low level of x - ray or euv emission in these objects relative to the ctts",
    ". however , @xcite found that there is little difference between the x - ray luminosities of ctts and wtts in their x - ray survey of pre - main sequence objects in taurus . even though there is a soft x - ray excess created in the accretion shock region of ctts ( gnther et al .",
    "2007 , and references therein ) , it does not significantly increase the x - ray production in most young stars @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite showed that ctts and wtts in the 10 myr tw hya association have similar x - ray luminosities .",
    "moreover , the x - ray luminosity does not decrease significantly over the first 100 myr of low mass stars @xcite , so the ctts and wtts / dd in our sample should have comparable x - ray luminosities .",
    "the euv radiation field , including emission from approximately 100 to 1000  , is also responsible for the ionization of heavy atoms , contributing to the population of free electrons available to excite an 2 molecule .",
    "the euv is difficult to investigate because the radiation is extremely extincted by interstellar hydrogen .",
    "@xcite find that the euv flux level does not change in the first @xmath010 myr , from studies of the ratio he ii 1640/civ 1550  .",
    "if we assume that the fuv level is an indicator of the strength of the euv emission , we come to similar conclusions .",
    "figure [ four ] shows one ctts and one dd that have the same fuv luminosity , so one would expect a strong enough euv radiation field in both sources to create the free electrons needed to excite 2 if it were present .",
    "however , the excess emission at 1600  is clearly seen in the ctts ( fp tau ) and absent in the dd ( mml 36 ) .",
    "since the high energy radiation fields in both ctts and wtts / dd are comparable in strength , the most likely explanation for the lack of 2 emission in wtts / dd is that there is essentially no gas in their inner disks . given the close relationship between the 2 feature strength and @xmath11 shown in figure [ h2age ] , our results suggest that 2 gas dissipates in timescales consistent with the cessation of accretion ; when the gas is dissipated in the inner disk , there is no material left to accrete .",
    "we use the observations to make a rough estimate of the column density of 2 being collisionally excited .",
    "we assume that the 2 is emitted in an optically thin region of the disk with area @xmath13 and thickness @xmath14 .",
    "the emitted luminosity per unit volume is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the energy of the emitted photon , @xmath17 the 2 cross section , @xmath18 the impacting electron velocity , @xmath19 the electron number density , @xmath20 the electron fraction , and @xmath21 the number density of 2 .",
    "the expected flux at 1600  due to electron impact excitation is then [ h2 ] f_1600= . where @xmath22 is the surface density of 2 excited by electron impacts , @xmath23 the mass of hydrogen , @xmath24 the radius of the emitting region , and @xmath25 is the distance . in ingleby",
    "2009 ) we find that the electron excitation model that provides the best fit to the 1600  feature of our sample of ctts with stis spectra is characterized by a temperature @xmath26 5000 k and an electron energy of @xmath012 ev .",
    "for these values , @xmath27 @xcite . according to the thermal models of (",
    "* m08 ) , gas reaches @xmath28k within 1 au of the star , which is consistent with the upper limit to the extension of the 2 emitting region set by the stis resolution in the case of tw hya @xcite .",
    "we further assume that most electrons are capable of exciting 2 and adopt @xmath29 , as well as @xmath301 au and @xmath310.1 au ( m08 ) .",
    "using these numbers , and assuming that all the flux at 1600  is due to electron impact excitation , we get the estimates of @xmath22 in table 1 , which for ctts are consistent with predicted formation in the uppermost levels of the disk ( m08 ) .",
    "a similar estimate can be made for the column density of electron excited 2 in the wtts / dd in our sample , which have some dust remaining at larger radii but no detected ir 2 lines @xcite .",
    "these estimates are given in table [ tabprop ] .",
    "we used the flux of mml 36 , which is the wtts / dd with the highest flux at 1600  in our sample , to estimate the mass of 2 inside @xmath01 au ; we found that there must be less than @xmath32 earth masses , @xmath32% of the mmsn , lower than the 0.01% of the mmsn estimated by @xcite .",
    "this has important implications for the formation of terrestrial planets , especially if gas is needed to circularize orbits @xcite .",
    "@xcite theorize that at least 0.01% of the mmsn must be present during the formation of proto - planets , which form around 10 myr according to simulations by @xcite .",
    "our column density estimates indicate that the amount of 2 gas present in wtts / dd with ages of 10 - 100 myr is too small to circularize the orbits of the terrestrial planets being formed at that time .",
    "our results support the conclusion by @xcite that there must be an additional source responsible for damping eccentricities , one possibility being dynamical friction with remaining planetesimals .",
    "another possibility is that other species of gas exist after the 2 has been depleted , for example , c and o have been detected around the 10 myr debris disk @xmath33 pic @xcite .",
    "c and o do not feel strong radiation pressure due to the low fuv flux in wtts and therefore may remain after the 2 has been depleted @xcite .",
