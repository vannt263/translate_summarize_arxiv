    "was presented in @xcite .",
    "our basic idea is to represent any zero - mean , possibly asymmetric , distribution as an appropriate mixture of two - point zero - mean distributions .",

    "( clearly , @xmath58 for all real @xmath59 if the r.v .",

    "thus , the set @xmath60 of two - point sets constitutes a partition of @xmath53 .",
    "one can see that the conditional distribution of the zero - mean r.v .",
    "@xmath0 given the random two - point set @xmath2 is the uniquely determined zero - mean distribution on the set @xmath2 .",
    "it follows that the distribution of the zero - mean r.v .",
    "@xmath0 with a continuous strictly increasing d.f .",
    "is represented as a mixture of two - point zero - mean distributions . a somewhat similar representation  of any probability distribution as the mixture of two - point distributions with the same skewness coefficient @xmath61 ( but possibly with different means )",
    " goes back to kolmogorov ; very recently aizenman _ et al . _",
    "@xcite further developed this representation and applied it to ( anti-)concentration inequalities for functions of independent random variables and to spectral localization for random schroedinger operators .",
    "in accordance with their purposes , instead of r.v.s @xmath62 aizenman _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( who refer to @xmath63 and @xmath64 as markers ) essentially deal with r.v.s ( i ) @xmath65 ( in a case of markers moving in opposite directions ) and with ( ii ) @xmath66 ( in a case of markers moving in the same direction , where @xmath67 is a @xmath68-quantile of the distribution of @xmath0 ) .",
    "the construction described above in terms of @xmath62 corresponds , clearly , to the case of opposite - moving markers .    while an analogous same - direction zero - mean disintegration is possible , we shall not deal with it in this paper .",
    "for a zero - mean distribution , the advantage of an opposite - directions construction is that the resulting two - point zero - mean distributions are less asymmetric than those obtained by using a same - direction method ( in fact , we shall show that our opposite - directions disintegration is most symmetric , in a variety of senses ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the same - direction method will produce two - point zero - mean distributions that are more similar to one another in width .",
    "thus , in our main applications  to self - normalized sums , the advantages of opposite - directions appear to be more important , since the distribution of a self - normalized sum is much more sensitive to the asymmetry than to the inhomogeneity of the constituent two - point distributions in width ; this appears to matter more in the setting of corollary  [ cor : stud - asymm ] than in the one of corollary  [ cor : student - normal ] .",
    "these mixture representations of a distribution are similar to the representations of the points of a convex compact set as mixtures of the extreme points of the set ; the existence of such representations is provided by the celebrated krein - milman - choquet - bishop - de leeuw ( kmcbdl ) theorem ; concerning `` non - compact '' versions of this theorem see e.g.  @xcite . in our case , the convex set would be the set of all zero - mean distributions on @xmath53 .",
    "however , in contrast with the kmcbdl - type pure - existence theorems , the representations given in @xcite , @xcite , and this paper are constructive , specific , and , as shown here , optimal , in a variety of senses .",
    "moreover , in a certain sense @xcite and this paper provide disintegration of r.v.s rather than that of their distributions , as the two - point set @xmath69 is a function of the observed value @xmath59 of the r.v .",
    "this makes it convenient to construct statistical tests for asymmetry patterns and for location without symmetry conditions .",
    "exact inequalities implying conservative properties of such tests will be given in this paper .",
    "these developments extend the mentioned results established earlier by efron , eaton , and pinelis under the orthant symmetry condition .    more specifically",
    ", one can construct generalized versions of the self - normalized sum , which require  instead of the symmetry of independent r.v.s @xmath4  only that the @xmath4 s be zero - mean : @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , and the reciprocating function @xmath74 is constructed as above , based on the distribution of @xmath4 , for each @xmath16 , so that the @xmath75 s may be different from one another if the @xmath4 s are not identically distributed . note that @xmath76 ( recall here ) when the @xmath4 s are symmetric .",
    "et al _ @xcite and shao @xcite obtained limit theorems for the `` symmetric '' version of @xmath77 ( with @xmath78 in place of @xmath79 ) , whereas the @xmath4 s were not assumed to be symmetric .",
    "corollaries  [ cor : student - normal ] and [ cor : stud - asymm ] in subsection  [ subsec : several ] of this paper suggest that statistical tests based on the `` corrected for asymmetry '' statistics @xmath80 and @xmath81 have desirable conservativeness and similarity properties , which could result in greater power ; further studies are needed here .",
    "( recall that a test is referred to as ( approximately ) similar if the type i error probabilities are ( approximately ) the same for all distributions corresponding to the null hypothesis . )    actually , in this paper we provide two - point zero - mean disintegration of any zero - mean r.v .",
    "@xmath0 , with a d.f .",
    "not necessarily continuous or strictly increasing . toward that end , randomization ( by means of a r.v .  uniformly distributed in interval @xmath82 ) is used to deal with the atoms of the distribution of r.v .",

    "thus , replacing @xmath84 in the numerators of @xmath80 and @xmath77 by @xmath85 , one obtains approximate pivots to be used to construct confidence intervals or , equivalently , tests for an unknown mean @xmath86 .",

    "<S> the mentioned disintegration of zero - mean r.v.s implies , in particular , that an arbitrary zero - mean distribution is represented as the mixture of two - point zero - mean distributions ; moreover , this mixture representation is most symmetric in a variety of senses . somewhat similar representations  of any probability distribution as the mixture of two - point distributions with the same skewness coefficient ( but possibly with different means )  go back to kolmogorov ; very recently , aizenman _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> further developed such representations and applied them to ( anti-)concentration inequalities for functions of independent random variables and to spectral localization for random schroedinger operators . </S>",
    "<S> one kind of application given in the present paper is to construct certain statistical tests for asymmetry patterns and for location without symmetry conditions . </S>",
    "<S> exact inequalities implying conservative properties of such tests are presented . </S>",
    "<S> these developments extend results established earlier by efron , eaton , and pinelis under a symmetry condition . </S>"
