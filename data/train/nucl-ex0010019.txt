    "this feature is interpreted  @xcite as a fingerprint of a phase transition from a state with strong pairing interaction to a state where the pairing correlations are quenched .",
    "because of the smoothing performed by the canonical - partition function , discrete transitions between the different quasi - particle regimes , as observed within the micro - canonical ensemble , are hidden , and only the phase transition related to the quenching of the pair correlations as a whole can be seen .    the shape of the heat - capacity curve is related to the level - density . in general",
    "a constant - temperature level density gives a pronounced @xmath127 shape  @xcite , while a pure fermi - gas level density provides a linear heat capacity @xmath128 ; see the dashed lines of fig .",
    "[ fig : crit ] .",
    "the more prominent @xmath127 shape in @xmath1er is due to a quicker rise in the heat capacity .",
    "this is the same phenomenon as observed in the micro - canonical ensemble , where the concave shape of the @xmath2er entropy was assigned to the blocking effect of the odd neutron .",
    "shell model monte carlo calculations  @xcite on various fe isotopes have shown that the pairing - phase transition is strongly correlated with the suppression of neutron pairs with increasing temperature .",
    "it is also observed that the reduction of neutron pairs is much stronger in the even- than in the odd - mass isotopes , giving rise to a more pronounced @xmath127 shape in the even nuclei . the same difference in the heat capacity",
    "is also observed experimentally between @xmath55dy and @xmath51dy , and @xmath56yb and @xmath52yb  @xcite .    in order to extract a critical temperature for the quenching of pair correlations from the canonical data ,",
    "two different approaches has been tested .",
    "first , the local maximum of the heat capacity relative to the fermi - gas approximation of fig .",
    "[ fig : crit ] have been determined to be @xmath129 mev for @xmath1er and @xmath130 mev for @xmath2er , see the arrows of fig .",
    "[ fig : crit ] .",
    "this method relies very much on the fermi - gas extrapolation of the level density .",
    "the second approach depends on the assumption that the nuclear level density can be approximated by a constant - temperature expression at low excitation energies . within the canonical ensemble",
    "this assumption provides the relations @xmath131 @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the constant - temperature parameter . by fitting @xmath134 as a function of @xmath135 to a straight line of slope @xmath136",
    ", @xmath133 can be determined .",
    "to minimize the dependency of the extracted critical temperature on the extrapolated level density , the fit is performed between @xmath137 mev . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : e ] ) this corresponds to energies in the level density curve up to @xmath21 mev .",
    "then @xmath133 is identified with the critical temperature , since @xmath138 has a pole at @xmath139 .",
    "the critical temperature is determined to @xmath140 mev for @xmath1er and @xmath141 mev for @xmath2er .",
    "the dashed - dotted lines of fig .",
    "[ fig : crit ] describe eq .",
    "( [ eq : cvt ] ) with asymptotes at @xmath142 .",
    "the different values derived for @xmath143 are quoted in table  [ tab : crit ] . the micro - canonical caloric - curve method ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gross ] ) is only supposed to provide the critical temperature for breaking of the first particle pair , while the others should give the critical temperature for the total quenching of the pairing correlations .",
    "the canonical constant - temperature approach relies on experimental data , but it can be questionable whether eqs .",
    "( [ eq : invt ] ) and  ( [ eq : cvt ] ) describes the nucleus well at low excitation energies .",
    "the method of deducing @xmath143 from the local maximum of the canonical heat capacity relative to the fermi - gas approximation depends highly on the extrapolation of the level density .",
    "the most straight forward method is to obtain the temperature directly from the slope of the micro - canonical entropy .",
    "there seem to be a tendency for the critical temperature in @xmath1er to be slightly lower than in @xmath2er .",
    "all results are however equal within the approximated uncertainties , with a mean value of @xmath144 mev for both nuclei .",
    "the results for @xmath1er agrees with recent finite - temperature hartree fock bogoliubov calculations for @xmath145er  @xcite , in which the critical - temperature estimate extracted is @xmath146 mev .",
    "this value is somewhat higher than the present derived result for @xmath1er .",
    "this diversity is probably due to application of different interpretations of where exactly the phase transition takes place . since the shapes of the heat - capacity curves of @xmath145er and @xmath1er are practically identical , we assume that the calculated critical temperature for quenching of pair correlations in @xmath145er coincides with the experimental findings for @xmath1er",
    ".    relativistic hartree - bcs calculations  @xcite also find the proton and neutron pairing gaps to vanish around @xmath147 mev of temperature in @xmath1er and @xmath148er .",
    "the heat capacity shows two peaks corresponding to these events , characteristic of second order phase transitions from superfluid to normal phase  @xcite .",
    "thus theoretically , the pair quenching is calculated to be a phase transition of second order .",
    "provided that negative heat capacity is a sufficient signal , the observed breaking of nucleon pairs in the micro - canonical ensemble appears like first - order phase transitions .",
    "the process of breaking one nucleon pair does however not lead to a total quenching of the pair correlations , and may not be described by the same physics as the pairing - phase transition .",
    "it is not clear how a series of phase transitions should be interpreted physically .",
    "the @xmath0-strength function is governed by different multipolarities of electric and magnetic character .",
    "we assume however , that the @xmath0 decay in the continuum is dominated by dipole transitions and will try to model the @xmath0-strength function theoretically .",
    "it is commonly adopted that the e1 strength is determined by the giant electric dipole resonance ( gedr ) at high @xmath0 energies .",
    "more doubtful is the assumption that the tail of the gedr governs the e1 strength at low @xmath0 energies when the tail approaches zero  @xcite .",
    "a model  @xcite taking into account the energy and temperature dependence of the gedr width is often utilized to describe the experimental data  @xcite .",

    "because of the much lower strength compared to the gedr , the resonance is denoted the pygmy resonance . to account for the e1 radiation ,",

    "the pygmy resonance has been explained by the enhancement of the e1 @xmath0-strength function @xcite .",
    "the possibility that it on the contrary is of m1 character can not be excluded . at an excitation energy around @xmath166 mev , there is a concentration of orbital m1 strength in the weakly collective scissors mode  @xcite",

    "the normalization constant @xmath162 is close to 1 for @xmath2er ( table [ tab : fit ] ) , showing that the adopted theoretical model reproduces the absolute values of the @xmath0-strength functions very well . the deviation from @xmath136",
    "can be explained by uncertain values of the gedr parameters for the investigated nuclei and uncertainties in the experimental normalization of the @xmath0-strength functions .",
    "also the @xmath162 value for @xmath1er is reasonable , provided that the adopted value for the neutron - resonance radiative width is reliable .",
    "levels in @xmath1er and @xmath2er in the excitation region up to the neutron separation energy were populated with the ( @xmath3he,@xmath9@xmath0 ) and ( @xmath3he,@xmath3he@xmath0 ) reaction , respectively . the level density and @xmath0-ray strength function of @xmath1er and @xmath2er are determined from their corresponding primary @xmath0-ray spectra .",

    "in addition , the canonical ensemble provides an excellent opportunity to study the different mechanisms governing the thermodynamic properties of odd and even systems .",
