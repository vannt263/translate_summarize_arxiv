    "traditional ground based radial velocity searches for extra - solar planetary systems have used medium- and large - size telescopes assigned to the program for particular nights of observing . while this type of approach has been extremely successful , resulting in about 120 detections of planetary - mass companions to solar - type stars ,",
    "the vagaries of the telescope scheduling process introduces certain restrictions and constraints on the optimal acquisition of time - critical observations . in radial velocity surveys",
    ", it is often the case that once a candidate planetary system has been identified and a preliminary orbit determined , additional observations must be obtained at particular orbital phases in order to place tighter constraints on particular orbital elements . obtaining the necessary data at the optimal orbital phase may be extremely difficult if observing runs are scheduled for a few nights once per month , or even less frequently . thus a telescope that is queue scheduled , such as the hobby - eberly telescope , ( het ) permits the observer to react quickly to the data and to obtain timely follow - up observations of critical targets at the orbital phases where they are needed .",
    "we report use of the het to detect a planetary companion in a 54.23day period orbit to the star hd37605 .",
    "the ability of the het observing queue to accommodate our observing needs enabled us to discover the planet with only a total of 100 days ( slightly less than two orbital periods ) elapsing between the first and final observations .",
    "we discuss both the detection of the planetary companion itself and the special attributes of the het that enabled the final orbital confirmation to be obtained in a very timely and expeditious manner .",
    "the hobby - eberly telescope consists of an array of 91 hexagonal shape , spherical figure mirrors , each of 1meter diameter , in a fixed truss tilted at @xmath1 zenith distance , resulting in a maximum effective aperture of 9.2 m diameter .",
    "declination ranges in the sky between @xmath2 and @xmath3 may be selected by rotating the telescope truss in azimuth .",
    "a star is observed by tracking an optical fiber bundle along the telescope focal plane while the telescope structure remains fixed , and feeding the light into the spectrograph .",
    "the het design was optimized for large - scale , low sky - density spectroscopic surveys .",
    "the telescope is _ not _ assigned to a given program for a given night , but rather is queue scheduled , thus interleaving observations from a large number of different programs employing different instrument configurations .",
    "the het data distribution policy is to allow the pi to gain access to the pervious nights data every morning allowing rapid feed back to the het astronomers .",
    "this is an ideal mode of operation for our high - precision radial velocity program .",
    "the high resolution spectrograph ( hrs ) @xcite for the het was built by a team headed by robert tull and phillip macqueen .",
    "this spectrograph was designed to be able to make stellar radial velocity variation measurements with a precision of 3ms@xmath0 or better on stars as faint as @xmath4 .",
    "the instrument is housed in an insulated enclosure in the basement of the het building , and thus is not moving with the telescope . the image scrambling provided by the 34.3 m long optical fiber feed helps ensure that the pupil seen by the spectrograph is always illuminated in a consistent manner .",
    "only a set number of instrument configurations are available , and these are all defined by kinematic mounts for the grating and cross - disperser positions .",
    "the i@xmath5 gas cell is contained in a collimated section in front of the spectrograph slit , so refocusing of any optics is unnecessary for i@xmath5 cell use .",
    "the detector is a mosaic of two @xmath6 pixel e2v ccds . for our high - precision radial velocity observations ,",
    "we use the hrs in a mode giving resolving power of 60,000 .",
    "the echelle grating was used on the center of the blaze , and the cross disperser was positioned so that the break between the `` red '' and the `` blue '' ccd chips was at around 5940 . for most seeing conditions ,",
    "a 2arcsec diameter optical fiber was used .",
    "so far , we have observed 173 f - m dwarfs four or more times .",
    "the f through k stars are selected to be stars with low levels of stellar activity based on x - ray emission , photometric variability , and measured ca  ii h&k emission .",
    "we intentionally do not bias the selection on stellar metallicity , but we do attempt to exclude stars with @xmath7 greater than about 15kms@xmath0 and known short - period binary stars . the separate m - dwarf survey and its selection criteria",
    "are discussed by @xcite . of all of these stars ,",
    "20 show large - amplitude variations indicative of previously unknown binary star systems , and 11 additional stars show rms variations greater than 20ms@xmath0 , but probably not large enough to be due to binary stellar companions .",
    "these stars represent good candidates for short - period planetary companions .",
    "figure  [ het_rms ] shows a histogram of the velocity rms about the mean of our time - series measurements for the remaining 142 stars having an rms of 20ms@xmath0 or less , after any statistically significant linear velocity trends have been removed .",
    "the time span of the data for each star ranges from one week to greater than three years .",
    "the median rms of the 123 stars in figure  [ het_rms ] with rms of 13ms@xmath0 or less is 4.0ms@xmath0 .",
    "if we examine just the 112 stars with rms of 8ms@xmath0 or less ( the bulk of the sample ) , then both the mean and the median rms of the remaining `` stable '' stars are just 3.6ms@xmath0 .",
    "the peak of the histogram is centered in the 2 - 3ms@xmath0 bin .",
    "we note that a significant contributing factor to the observed velocity rms is intrinsic to the stars themselves .",
    "we have _ not _ attempted to correct these rms values in any way for velocity variations induced by stellar photospheric and chromospheric activity ( `` jitter '' ) . in general , the stars for which we have obtained the lowest rms are old , inactive stars with spectra of high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "thus , figure  [ het_rms ] clearly demonstrates that we have achieved routine radial velocity precision of 3ms@xmath0 or better with the het - hrs in routine `` production mode '' on a large sample of a wide variety of stars over a substantial time period .",
    "indeed , a significant fraction of our stars are showing radial velocity precision of 2ms@xmath0 or better , which is comparable to the precision achieved for high snr observations with the eso vlt / uves by @xcite .",
    "our 2 - 3ms@xmath0 precision is significantly better than that obtained with coralie @xcite or elodie @xcite , and is directly competitive with the 3ms@xmath0 precision which is achieved on the keck hires @xcite , aat @xcite , or the 2ms@xmath0 demonstrated by harps @xcite .",
    "hd37605 ( hip 26664 , bd+05 985 , sao 113015 , g 99 - 22 ) is a v=8.69 k0v star .",
    "the hipparcos @xcite parallax of 23.32mas corresponds to a distance of 42.9parsec , and gives an absolute magnitude of @xmath8 .",
    "the stellar parameters : effective temperature , t@xmath9 , surface gravity , log@xmath10 , and microturbulence , @xmath11 listed in table  [ star ] were derived using moog @xcite with atmospheres based on the 1995 version of the atlas9 code @xcite following the procedure outlined in @xcite and briefly described below . within iraf , we fit the 20 fei and 12 feii lines listed in table 1 of @xcite with gaussian profiles to obtain equivalent widths . the t@xmath9 was derived by requiring that individual line abundances be independent of excitation potential .",
    "likewise , @xmath11 was derived by requiring that individual line abundances be independent of line strength .",
    "the log@xmath10 was determined by forcing ionization equilibrium between neutral and singly ionized fe .",
    "we adopted solar log@xmath12(fe ) of 7.52 from @xcite , which yields an [ fe / h ] for hd37605 of 0.39@xmath130.06 .",

    "+ [ fe / h ] & 0.39 & 0.07 +      our typical het observing technique is to obtain about 4 - 5 initial radial velocity measurements over the course of 1 - 2 weeks , in order to search for short - period `` hot - jupiter '' rv variability .",
    "if a star appears stable on short timescales , it is then scheduled for less frequent observations in order to search for longer period orbits . for hd37605 ( @xmath14 ) , exposure times were 900 seconds , giving a typical signal - to - noise ratio of about 250 per resolution element .",
    "the initial set of observations of hd37605 were constant to within the observational error , but the next observation taken about one month later showed a decrease of about 200ms@xmath0 .",
    "we then took advantage of the queue scheduled operations of the het to put the star back into the queue at high priority for frequent observations .",
    "following our request for frequent coverage , the het resident astronomers then obtained spectra every 3 - 4 days during the decrease in radial velocity .",
    "data from each night s observations were reduced and velocities computed the following morning .",
    "we were easily able to fit a new orbital solution as the data from each night became available .",
    "it quickly became obvious that the radial velocity minimum and periastron passage would occur just as the star was being lost from the het observability window ; the last het data points would be obtained during evening twilight .",
    "it was critical to attempt to obtain nightly het velocity measurements during this orbital phase , as the depth of the velocity minimum would constrain the orbital eccentricity and the k  velocity ( and hence the companion minimum mass ) . since these were going to be difficult het observations , and it was quite possible that the het would no longer be able to observe the star before the periastron passage was complete , we arranged for the mcdonald observatory 2.1 m telescope observer to obtain radial velocity measurements with the sandiford cassegrain echelle spectrograph @xcite and its i@xmath5 cell during this interval .",
    "this instrument records the 5000 to 6000 region at resolving power of 60,000 .",
    "these 2.1 m data would be of significantly lower velocity precision due to the much lower signal - to - noise ratio and the inherent mechanical and thermal instability of a large heavy cassegrain spectrograph , but they would certainly be adequate to cover this crucial interval when the het might not be able to observe the star .",
    "the het data for hd37605 are shown as filled dots in figure  [ rvcurve ] , and the 2.1 m sandiford echelle data are shown as open triangles .",
    "the observed velocities from both telescopes are given in table  [ rvtable ] .",
    "the velocities in this table have been corrected for the different ( and arbitrary ) velocity zero points of the two instruments used .",
    "the simultaneous orbital solution to both data sets is also shown in figure  [ rvcurve ] .",
    "the rms residual of the het / hrs data from this orbital solution is 4.7ms@xmath0 .",
    "the rms residual of the 2.1 m sandiford echelle data from the solution is 44.2ms@xmath0 .",

    "normally , we would prefer to measure the ca  ii s index from the ca  ii h and k lines , but the het primary mirror coatings and the het optical fibers result in a short - wavelength cutoff of the het hrs at around 4200",
