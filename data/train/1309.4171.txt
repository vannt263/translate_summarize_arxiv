    "after more than forty years efforts , a higgs - like particle at around 125 gev was finally found in july 2012 thanks to the hard work of atlas @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . in order to identify the new resonance with the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson , one has to confirm its fundamental quantum numbers , e.g. spin and parity .",
    "the authors of the literatures @xcite have provided a useful method to discriminate between pure scalar and pure pseudoscalar state for the new particle .",
    "the observations of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 channels in the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite show that the sm higgs boson is consistent with the experiments and a pure cp - odd higgs is disfavored .",
    "however , it is also possible that the new particle , besides owning the similar coupling structures as the sm higgs boson , is affected by the new physics ( np ) , for example , the cp violating np which will introduce cp - odd component into the sm higgs boson . in such scenario , the higgs - like resonance should be a cp mixed state , rather than a cp eigenstate .",
    "thus it is of interest to explore the cp mixed property of the higgs - like particle both to increase our understanding of the higgs physics and to search for the np beyond the sm .",
    "some authors @xcite have studied the decay channel @xmath10 with @xmath11 , @xmath12 or @xmath3 and investigated the effects of the cp - even and cp - odd @xmath0 couplings .",
    "for example , the authors of the literature @xcite defined a momentum asymmetry to study the @xmath13 distribution in the differential decay rate of @xmath8 for various @xmath0 coupling structures , where @xmath13 is the momentum square of the virtual intermediate gauge boson @xmath14 .",
    "godbole et al .",
    "@xcite constructed some angular asymmetries in this channel to directly probe the ratio of the cp - even and cp - odd components .",
    "since some events in this channel have been collected and well analyzed experimentally @xcite , we further extend previous works @xcite and analyze a momentum asymmetry and two angular asymmetries to show the difference from different cp - couplings .",
    "the newly reported mass value of the higgs boson candidate from @xcite will be used in our calculation .",
    "these asymmetries can clearly show the ratios of different couplings in the general @xmath0 vertex , in other words , the cp mixed property of the higgs - like particle , and therefore might be interesting observables in the future precise experiments to explore the np in the higgs sector .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the amplitude of the process @xmath8 is evaluated , and the expressions of the differential decay rate and some asymmetries are presented .",
    "section 3 is our numerical analysis and some discussions on phenomenology .",
    "finally , we give a summary in section 4 .",
    "the process @xmath4 is given in figure [ tree ] where the higgs boson decays to two gauge bosons @xmath15 and @xmath16 , one of which is real with momentum square @xmath17 and the other is virtual with momentum square @xmath13 , then each of them decays to a lepton pair .",
    "the polar angles of lepton pairs @xmath18@xmath19 and @xmath20@xmath21 in the rest frame of their parent gauge boson @xmath14 are denoted as @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , and the azimuthal angle of the planes formed by each lepton pair and their parent gauge boson in the higgs rest frame is denoted as @xmath24 . some events in this process",
    "have been collected in the experiments .",
    "atlas @xcite selects the events satisfying @xmath25 \\,\\text{gev}$ ] and @xmath26 \\,\\text{gev}$ ] while for cms @xcite , @xmath27 \\,\\text{gev}$ ] and @xmath28 \\,\\text{gev}$ ] . for this reason , to perform a complete theoretical analysis",
    ", one should regard @xmath17 as a variable .",
    "however , the phase space @xmath29 $ ] for @xmath30 gives the dominant contribution , so we will take @xmath31 throughout this paper for simplicity . on the other hand , we choose @xmath32 $ ] in our calculation where the upper bound corresponds to the kinematically allowed maximum and the lower bound is set according to the experiments .",
    "since the @xmath33 pair in the final states is not easy to be observed , we discuss only , as the experiments did , four channels @xmath34 .",
    "additionally , the masses of the light leptons @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the final states only give the next leading order @xmath37 contribution and hence will be neglected .",
    ", width=377 ]    the general form of the effective @xmath0 vertex , including both cp - even and cp - odd couplings , can be written as @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the weinberg mixing angle , @xmath42 is the coupling constant of @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the totally antisymmetric tensor with @xmath45 .",
    "the tree level sm coupling corresponds to @xmath46 , @xmath47 and the sm higgs boson is a pure cp - even state .",
    "although the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 will be corrected by the loop effect in the sm , we will identify @xmath46 , @xmath47 as the sm case , since the contribution of the radiative corrections is small @xcite .",
    "the second term , another kind of cp - even coupling , is a high dimension operator which might be generated from the loop diagrams or heavy degrees of freedom .",
    "the third term will introduce a cp - odd coupling and violate cp symmetry .",
    "these three terms will be referred henceforth as @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 cases , respectively . in general",
    ", when we go beyond the sm , parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath53 can be complex .",
    "however , since their imaginary parts might destroy the hermiticity of the effective theory @xcite and the process is dominated by the tree level in the sm , we will assume in this work , for simplicity , the parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) are all real",
    ".    the differential decay rate of the process @xmath8 can be expressed as @xmath54 which can be obtained by setting the parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath53 in the literature @xcite real .",
    "the notations @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 denote @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath61 , in terms of the vector and axial vector couplings of @xmath62 , is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the third component of the weak isospin and @xmath65 is , in unit of e , the electric charge of the lepton @xmath66 .",
    "some variables @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are introduced in eq .",
    "( [ mmstar ] ) while @xmath70 and @xmath71 are defined as @xmath72 for the real gauge boson @xmath14 , @xmath73 .    integrating the differential decay rate over all of the angular variables , one obtains @xmath74 and the decay rate of this process reads @xmath75",
    "the lepton masses have been neglected in the above equations due to @xmath76 .",
    "actually , if we study the decay channel @xmath77 or @xmath78 , additional symmetry factor @xmath79 should be included .",
    "however , all of the asymmetries discussed in the present work are ratios and independent on the overall factor , one can forget the symmetry factor in the calculation .",
    "the @xmath13 distributions in the differential decay rate of @xmath8 for different @xmath0 couplings could be different .",
    "the authors of the literature @xcite constructed an interesting observable called high - low asymmetry , which is defined as @xmath80 to probe such difference . comparing with atlas @xcite and cms @xcite data",
    ", they found the spin-2 higgs is disfavored by the experiments .",
    "we extend their analysis to the @xmath81 case , which was not considered in the literature @xcite , and reveal some interesting phenomena .",
    "this will be discussed in the next section .    in order to directly probe various couplings in the general @xmath0 vertex",
    ", we shall study , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , two angular asymmetries , which might be very interesting observables in the future experiments .",
    "the first one is @xmath82 it is easily found that such asymmetry selects terms containing @xmath83 and is proportional to @xmath84 .",
    "the corresponding integrated asymmetry over @xmath13 is @xmath85 by observing these asymmetries in the experiments , one can get information about the cp - odd term and have a more profound understanding about the cp mixed property of the higgs - like particle .",
    "the other angular asymmetry can be defined as @xmath86 it is seen that such asymmetry selects terms containing @xmath87 and is contributed by terms containing @xmath84 or @xmath88 . the corresponding integrated asymmetry over @xmath13 is @xmath89    the observables @xmath90 and @xmath91 are not totally independent in our formula . after performing a combined analysis of them , one can construct an interesting quantity as @xmath92 with @xmath93 @xmath94 , by definition , is a constant and proportional to @xmath49 in our formula and has no any relationship with the momentum region and @xmath53 should be momentum dependent .",
    "since such dependence is origin from integrating over the degree of freedom in the high energy scale , it is reasonable to suppose these parameters are constant in the electroweak scale .",
    "] appearing on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ deff ] ) . for this reason ,",
    "the studies of this quality in the experiments are very important .",
    "first , the parameter @xmath95 is proportional to @xmath49 and hence reflects the magnitude of the @xmath51 component of the higgs - like particle .",
    "if @xmath95 is close to zero , which means @xmath96 , the @xmath51 component of the higgs - like particle is negligible while the large @xmath95 means that the @xmath51 component is important .",
    "second , it is also interesting to study such quantity in different momentum regions in the experiments and examine whether it is a constant or not .",
    "if the answer is negative , the most possible reason is that the momentum - dependence of the parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath53 can not be neglected .",
    "of course , it is also not an easy work to fix that @xmath95 is not a constant experimentally .",
    "the @xmath13 distributions in the normalized differential decay rate of @xmath8 for various couplings have been plotted in figure [ ahldiff ] .",
    "we found that the behavior of the @xmath51 higgs boson is different from @xmath50 and @xmath52 cases .",
    "such difference can also be seen by studying the corresponding high - low asymmetries . here",
    "we choose the high energy region as @xmath97 $ ] and the low energy region @xmath98 $ ] , which means the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ ahl ] ) are set to be @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "after the successful running of the lhc in 2011 and 2012 , some events in the decay channel @xmath8 have been collected , therein atlas @xcite observed 7.8 events at the high energy region and 8.1 events at the low energy region while cms @xcite reported 7.6 and 5.1 . according to the eq .",
    "( [ ahl ] ) , one can obtain the high - low asymmetries as @xmath102 the uncertainty on the @xmath103 is evaluated according to the uncertainty on the experiment data as given in the literature @xcite whereas for the cms @xcite , the uncertainty is not available .",
    "the high - low asymmetries for various couplings in our formula can be calculated as @xmath104 which correspond to the sm , @xmath81 , @xmath52 cases , respectively .",
    "one can find that @xmath105 is notably different from @xmath106 and @xmath107 and also deviates from the experiment values @xmath103 and @xmath108 as given in eq .",
    "( [ data ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the high - low asymmetry value of the sm higgs boson @xmath106 is consistent with that of the atlas @xmath103 and cms @xmath108 .",
    "since the behaviors of the @xmath109 and @xmath52 higgs are similar in figure [ ahldiff ] , such asymmetry can not give any useful constraint on the cp - odd component .     for various couplings .",

    "@xmath116 is associate with the @xmath109 case , @xmath117 and @xmath118 corresponds to the @xmath81 case while @xmath119 and @xmath120 the @xmath52 case . the integrated asymmetries @xmath90 and @xmath91 in the full parameter space of @xmath111 and @xmath112",
    "have been plotted in figures [ a1int ] and [ a2int ] , respectively , where the variables of integration in eqs .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) are set to be @xmath101 and @xmath110 with @xmath121 .",
    "it is found that the behaviors of @xmath90 and @xmath91 are similar .",
    "they both reach the maximal value , which could be up to @xmath122 , when @xmath123 , and can be higher than @xmath124 in most of the parameter space .",
    "actually , these integrated asymmetries @xmath90 and @xmath91 , as a function of @xmath125 , with @xmath126 and @xmath127 , have been investigated in the literature @xcite .    taking a close look at figures [ a1int ] and [ a2int ]",
    ", one can find that the integrated asymmetries , when @xmath128 , are not sensitive to the change of @xmath111 .",
    "we therefore choose @xmath120 and plot the behaviors of the differential asymmetries @xmath129 and @xmath130 with the change of @xmath112 and @xmath113 , as shown in figures [ a1f20 ] and [ a2f20 ] .",
    "the maximal values of @xmath129 and @xmath130 are @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively , and these asymmetries can be larger than @xmath124 in most of the parameter space .",
    "we also notice that , if the np effect is weak , e.g. @xmath133 , the angular asymmetries , only about @xmath134 , are also hard to be observed and there will be a long way for us to understand the np .",
    "we have examined the general @xmath0 vertex which contains the sm , high dimension cp - even and cp - odd coupling structures . by studying the process @xmath1 with @xmath2 or @xmath3 , we have analyzed the high - low momentum asymmetry and two angular asymmetries to explore the cp mixed property of the higgs - like particle .",
    "the newly reported mass value of the higgs boson candidate from the lhc @xcite , @xmath135=125 gev , has been used in our calculation .",
    "the studies of the high - low momentum asymmetry has shown that the @xmath81 higgs is disfavored by the present data . in order to further understand the nature of the cp - odd component , we have analyzed two angular asymmetries in the process @xmath8 . the integrated angular asymmetries",
    "@xmath90 and @xmath91 could be over @xmath124 in most of the parameter space , and their maximal values can be up to @xmath122 . therefore these asymmetries are worth to be seriously considered in the future precise experiments and may provide us some important information on the cp mixed property of the new resonance .",
