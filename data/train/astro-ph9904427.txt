    "the extremely low background achieved on hst at @xmath18 allows for sensitive surveys for h@xmath0 to @xmath19 .",

    "1999 ; hereafter paper i ) .",

    "the identification of the emission lines as h@xmath0 is based on h - band apparent continuum magnitudes , their equivalent widths and the lack of other detected lines within the g141 bandpass . in two of the three cases for which optical spectroscopy has been attempted with lris on the keck 10 m telescope by teplitz et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the line identifications have been confirmed by detection of their [ oii]3727 emission .",
    "these objects ( j0055 + 8518a , @xmath27 ,",
    "j0622 - 0018a , @xmath28 ) are at the low redshift end of our sample and therefore are the most accessible to optical spectroscopy . in the third case ( j1237 + 6219a , @xmath29 ) no emission or absorption features were detected in the spectrum .",
    "we used the @xmath30 method ( schmidt 1968 ) to compute the luminosity function .",
    "each galaxy is assigned a volume , @xmath31 , equal to the volume within which it could lie and be detected by our survey .",
    "we calculated the maximum co - moving volume for each galaxy in each field with its appropriate line flux limit .",

    "the maximum redshift at which an object can be detected , @xmath34 , is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is computed from @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the luminosity distance at redshift @xmath40 . @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the h@xmath0 line flux and the flux limit , respectively .",
    "@xmath43 is the solid angle subtended by a single nicmos camera 3 image .",
    "only the central portion of each grism image samples the full range of wavelengths from @xmath44 , and the left and right portions of the image sample restricted spectral ranges .",
    "the field of view subtended by the central section is @xmath45 ; the two sides of the image subtend roughly @xmath46 each .",
    "thus the volume must be calculated separately for each portion of the detector .",
    "the grism sensitivity is a function of wavelength and this influences the effective volume probed , particularly at the ends of the spectral coverage , where the sensitivity ( and hence the available volume ) fall off steeply .",
    "the estimate of the source density in a luminosity bin of width @xmath47 centered on luminosity @xmath48 is simply the sum of the inverse volumes ( @xmath30 ) of all the sources with luminosities in the bin .",
    "the value of the luminosity function in that bin is    @xmath49    where index @xmath50 labels luminosity bins and index @xmath51 labels galaxies .",
    "the variances are computed by summing the squares of the inverse volumes ; the error bars of each luminosity bin are the square roots of the variances .    the apparent luminosity function must be corrected for incompleteness in the original source catalog . the approach we adopted is similar to that used in yan et al .",
    "we chose several well - detected emission - line galaxies spanning a range of w@xmath52 in the form of 2d spectra .",
    "we dimmed these template spectra by various factors and added them to the real nicmos grism images at random locations .",
    "we then applied the same detection procedure as in the original analyses ( see paper i ) to recover the template spectra .",
    "the use of random positions in the simulation allows us to include incompleteness corrections caused by crowding and spatially dependent errors in the sky subtraction and shading corrections .",
    "we added the dimmed template spectra to the 2d grism images with a wide range of sensitivities to simulate the true distribution of limiting fluxes in our survey fields .",
    "the final averaged detection rate provides a measurement of the dependence of the detection probability on the line flux limits , as well as equivalent width for w@xmath53 .",
    "the incompleteness correction is applied to each bin independently .    in figure 1",
    "we show our derived luminosity function and the local h@xmath0 lf as measured by gallego et al .",
    "our h@xmath0 luminosities have been corrected for [ nii ] contamination using h@xmath0/[nii]6583,6548 = 2.3 ( kennicutt 1992 ; gallego et al . 1996 ) .",

    "our sample is not large enough or deep enough to allow an independent determination of @xmath0 .",
    "figure 1 shows strong evolution in the h@xmath0 luminosity density from @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "this is no surprise given the evolution in the ultraviolet luminosity density , but our result provides an independent measure of evolution for h@xmath0 emission alone .",
    "the integrated h@xmath0 luminosity density at @xmath63 ( our median @xmath40 ) is @xmath64  h@xmath65  erg s@xmath4 mpc@xmath7 , approximately 14 times greater than the local value reported by gallego et al .",
    "gronwall ( 1998 ) has reported a preliminary measure of the local star formation density derived from the kiss survey that is consistent with the gallego et al . value . if the faint end slope is as steep as -1.6 , as found for the uv luminosity function at @xmath66 ( steidel et al .",
    "1999 ; pascarelle , lanzetta &  fernandez - soto 1998 ) , the integrated h@xmath0 luminosity density at @xmath63 would be roughly 50% higher still .",
    "two of the emission - line galaxies in our sample are possible agn candidates .",
    "if we remove the top three objects with the highest h@xmath0 fluxes from our luminosity function calculation , the integrated h@xmath0 luminosity density is reduced by @xmath67  40% , primarily due to the decrease of l@xmath68(h@xmath0 ) .",
    "we converted the integrated h@xmath0 luminosity density to a star formation rate ( sfr ) using the relation from kennicutt ( 1999 ) : @xmath69 .",
    "this assumes case b recombination at @xmath70  k and a salpeter imf ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "this conversion factor is about 10% smaller than the value listed in kennicutt ( 1983 ) , the difference reflecting updated evolutionary tracks .",
    "while different choices of stellar tracks introduce modest uncertainties in the conversion of uv and h@xmath0 luminosities to star formation rates , the choice of different imfs lead to rather large differences . to make consistent comparisons between our results and those in the literature",
    "derived from 1500  and 2800  uv continuum luminosity densities , we adopt the relation from kennicutt ( 1999 ) : @xmath72 .",
    "this relation is appropriate for the salpeter imf used to derive the h@xmath0 conversion factor .    in figure 2",
    ", we plot uncorrected published measurements of the volume - averaged global star formation rate at various epochs .",

    "our result is shown as a filled circle .",
    "the star formation rates shown in figure 2 are calculated from the luminosity densities integrated over the entire luminosity functions , for both h@xmath0 and the uv continuum .",

    "( 1998 ) measured h@xmath0 line fluxes for 13 cfrs galaxies at @xmath77 and concluded that the star formation rate deduced from h@xmath0 is significantly larger than that derived from the 2800  continuum luminosity density . using the conversion factors which we have employed throughout this paper ( @xmath78 for h@xmath0 and @xmath79 for the uv continuum )",
    ", we estimate that without correcting for extinction the star formation rate derived from their h@xmath0 luminosity density is a factor of 1.9 higher than that inferred from the 2800  continuum .",
    "the factor of 3 difference in the star formation rate between h@xmath0 and the uv continuum noted in glazebrook et al .",
    "( 1998 ) includes an extinction correction . as discussed below",
    ", the magnitude of the extinction correction is highly dependent on the relative spatial distributions of stars , gas and dust .",
    "pettini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found the star formation rates of lyman break galaxies at @xmath66 measured from h@xmath80 emission to be @xmath81 higher than those estimated from the 1500continuum .",
    "hogg et al . ( 1998 ) and hammer et al . ( 1997 ) derived the [ oii]3727 luminosity function and detected strong evolution in the [ oii ] luminosity density to @xmath82 .",
    "the conversion factor from the [ oii]3727 luminosity to a sfr , however , can differ by an order of magnitude , depending on the metallicity of the gas ( gallagher , hunter &  bushhouse 1989 ; kennicutt 1992 ) .",
    "in contrast , h@xmath0 provides a more direct measure of the star formation by effectively reprocessing the integrated stellar luminosity of galaxies shortward of the lyman limit .",
    "recent observations at sub - mm wavelengths indicate the star formation rate at @xmath83 is larger than that inferred from the rest - frame uv luminosity density ( hugh et al .",
    "the contribution of the sub - mm sources to the global star formation history is uncertain at this time , as most of the sub - mm sources do not have secure redshifts ( barger et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the clear trend for the longer wavelength determinations of the star formation rate to exceed those based on uv continua is one of the pieces of evidence for significant extinction at intermediate and high redshifts .",
    "the amplitude of the extinction correction is quite uncertain ( e.g. heckman et al .",
    "1997 ; meuers et al . 1997 ; steidel et al .",
    "our measurement spans @xmath84 , overlapping with the connolly et al .",
    "photometric redshift sample and allowing a direct comparison between the observed 2800  luminosity density and that inferred from h@xmath0 .",
    "the emission line galaxies selected by our survey have a co - moving number density similar to that of the bright lyman break galaxies at @xmath66 , and a median h magnitude that corresponds to approximately l@xmath85 ( paper i ) . while we are not comparing the same individual galaxies , the rough correspondence in space density and continuum absolute magnitudes between the uv- and h@xmath0-selected samples",
    "argues that they are drawn from similar or overlapping populations .",
    "our h@xmath0-based star formation rate is three times larger than the average of the three redshift bins measured by connolly et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the star formation rates derived from line or continuum luminosities depend strongly on the choice of imf , evolutionary tracks , and stellar atmospheres that are input into a specific spectral evolution model .",
    "the relevant issue for the present discussion is the ratio of the star formation rates derived from h@xmath0 and the 2800  continuum . as shown by glazebrook et al . (",
    "1998 ) this ratio differs significantly for the scalo and salpeter imfs and is a function of metallicity .",
    "our choice of the salpeter imf comes close to minimizing the difference between the published uv- and our h@xmath0-derived star formation rates .",
    "the use of a scalo imf and solar metallicity would increase the apparent discrepancy by a factor of @xmath86 . the only model considered by glazebrook et al . that further reduces the h@xmath0/2800",
    "star formation ratio is the salpeter imf with the gunn & stryker ( 1983 ) spectral energy distributions , and this model still leaves us with a factor of @xmath86 enhancement in apparent star formation activity measured at h@xmath0 .",
    "if we attribute the entire difference to reddening , the total extinction corrections at 2800  and h@xmath0 are large and model - dependent .",
    "the calculation is sensitive to the relative geometry of the stars , gas and dust , as well as the adopted reddening curve . in the extreme case of a homogeneous foreground screen and a mw or lmc reddening curve ,",
    "we derive a@xmath87  magnitudes . in local starburst galaxies , differential extinction between the nebular gas , and stellar continuum , and scattering produce an effective reddening curve that is significantly grayer than the mw or lmc curves ( calzetti , kinney &  storchi - bergmann 1994 ; 1996 ; calzetti 1997 ) . the calzetti reddening law ( calzetti 1997 ) is appropriate for geometries in which the stars , gas and dust are well mixed .",
    "in this model , our estimate of the dust extinction at 2800  is one to two magnitudes larger than in the simple screen case , and is an uncomfortably large correction compared to results from other methods ( e.g. , heckman et al .",
    "1998 ; steidel et al . 1999 ) .    the properties of the damped ly@xmath0 absorbers , diffuse backgrounds and galaxy counts at long wavelengths provide independent constraints on the amount of obscured star formation at large redshifts ( e.g. pei , fall , & hauser 1999 ; calzetti &  heckman 1998 ; blain et al . 1999 ) .",
    "our measurement of the global star formation rate derived from h@xmath0 agrees well with the model predictions in figure 7 of pei , fall , & hauser .    despite our efforts to quantify the incompleteness of the nicmos grism sample , some biases remain .",
    "the low resolution of the grisms prevent efficient detection of objects with line fluxes above our threshold but with rest - frame w@xmath88 .",
    "the gallego et al .",
    "( 1995 ) survey has a w@xmath52 threshold of 10 .",
    "gallego et al .",
    "( 1996 ) find that dwarf amorphous nuclear starbursts have modest equivalent widths but contribute little to the total luminosity density",
    ". some of the compact starburst nuclei will fall below our w@xmath52 threshold , and these objects can have substantial luminosities .",
    "their compact size mitigates against this somewhat as our spectral resolution is best for point sources .",
    "spectroscopy of galaxies from the cfrs sample at @xmath89 by tresse &  maddox ( 1996 ) weakly suggests that w@xmath52(h@xmath0 ) and luminosity are correlated .",
    "hst imaging and spectroscopic samples all suffer from a bias against low surface brightness objects .",
    "the slitless nature of our survey exacerbates the problem as the spectral resolution is a function of apparent source size .",
    "the half - light radii of the emission line galaxies in our sample range from 0.2@xmath90 to 0.7@xmath90 and the distribution is comparable to that seen in significantly deeper fields , such as the hdf - south and deep nicmos parallel fields ( yan et al .",
    "1998 ; storrie - lombardi et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the principal conclusions of this work are that the h@xmath0 luminosity density at @xmath82 is an order of magnitude larger than locally , that the global star formation rate derived from our h@xmath0 measurements exceeds that from the rest - frame uv by a factor of 3 and the implied extinction corrections are substantial .",
    "although the characteristics of this particular data set do not lend themselves to precise comparison between global averaged star formation rates inferred from uv continuum and line - emission , the systematically larger rates inferred from h@xmath0 at all redshifts point towards significant extinction at rest - frame uv wavelengths .",

    "in particular we thank john mackenty , duccio machetto , peg stanley , doug van orsow , and the staff of the presto division .",
