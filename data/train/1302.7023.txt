    "among the many functional physical properties in strongly correlated electron systems , high-@xmath19 superconductivity continues to pose long - term challenges and attract many researchers .",
    "elementary excitations in high-@xmath19 superconducting cuprates , such as spin and charge excitations , are important subjects in condensed matter physics not only for understanding superconductivity but also for a more fundamental understanding of strongly correlated electron systems .    to date ,",
    "spin excitations in high-@xmath19 cuprates have been extensively studied by neutron scattering  @xcite and more recently by resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) at cu-@xmath20 edge ,  @xcite while charge excitations have been studied by optical spectroscopy  @xcite and rixs at cu-@xmath0 edge .",
    "@xcite in addition to its ability to determine the energy and momentum of excitations , recent rixs studies at the cu-@xmath21 edge have demonstrated the ability of rixs to detect very low energy charge fluctuations in the ( y , nd)ba@xmath22cu@xmath23o@xmath24 system.@xcite moreover , the rixs technique near the cu-@xmath0 edge is sensitive to charge excitations triggered by the core hole potential in the intermediate state of the rixs process .",
    "in fact , rixs near the cu-@xmath0 edge has been successfully utilized to measure charge excitations across the charge transfer ( ct ) gap in various strongly correlated electron systems ,  @xcite with excitation energy typically in 2 - 4 ev range , depending on the particular system and doping levels .",
    "one characteristic feature of the high-@xmath19 cuprates is that the continuum - like charge excitation appears inside the ct gap upon hole or electron doping .",
    "@xcite recent technical developments towards finer energy resolution have enabled us to study this in - gap charge excitations in more detail .",
    "high-@xmath19 cuprates are one of the most suitable systems to study charge excitations inside the ct gap since it can be approximated by a single - band model , and therefore making theoretical handling relatively easy .",
    "et al_.  @xcite have reported a dispersive intra - band excitation inside the ct gap in the electron - doped system nd@xmath17ce@xmath18cuo@xmath3 .",
    "based on comparison with theoretical calculations , they claimed that this dispersive excitation is consistent with the dynamical charge - charge correlation function @xmath25 . on the other hand ,",
    "such a dispersive feature inside the ct gap has not been reported in hole - doped high-@xmath19 cuprates .",
    "instead , it has been reported that the continuum - like excitation of la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 near 1  ev at high - symmetry points increases with doping ,  @xcite showing an anomalous increase across the 1/8 doping point .",
    "@xcite our previous measurements showed that the charge excitation near 1  ev is enhanced at the @xmath26 and @xmath27 positions in stripe - ordered la@xmath28ba@xmath29cuo@xmath3 and la@xmath30ba@xmath31cuo@xmath3 , while such behavior is absent in la@xmath32ba@xmath33cuo@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite    in order to reconcile these experimental facts , we have carried out rixs measurements near the cu-@xmath0 absorption edge using single crystals of la@xmath1(sr , ba)@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( lsco , lbco ) covering a wide hole concentration range from @xmath34 to @xmath35 , focusing on charge excitations inside the ct gap .",
    "we used cu-@xmath0 edge rixs since it is more sensitive to charge excitations than at other absorption edges .",
    "the measurements were carried out at nearly 90 degrees scattering angle with the scattered photon direction parallel to the incident photon polarization .",
    "this scattering geometry greatly reduces the elastic intensity and enables us to study rixs spectra at low energies ( @xmath36  ev ) .",
    "we have found that the intensity of the charge excitation near 1  ev measured with incident photon energy @xmath10  kev has maxima around @xmath12 and @xmath13 for all doped samples , and this intensity increases monotonically with doping .",

    "similarly , it is natural to consider that the dispersive intra - band excitation we observe is the dynamical charge correlation function @xmath25 , therefore concluding that the electron and hole doped systems have similar @xmath25 .",
    "in fact , theoretical calculations indicate that @xmath25 has qualitatively similar @xmath65-dependence in both electron- and hole - doped systems.@xcite    it has been theoretically demonstrated that the indirect rixs cross - section is linear with the dynamical charge correlation function at the limit where the short - lived , local core - hole potential is either weak or strong.@xcite on the other hand , ishii _",

    "this is consistent with the experimental fact in the present study that the @xmath25 type intra - band excitation of the hole - doped system was observed with the resonance energy near the poorly - screened condition , namely 9.003  kev . at these incident energies",
    "the core hole is created at the carrier - doped site and its potential does not perturb the valence electrons significantly , therefore this resonant condition is close to the aforementioned weak limit of the core - hole potential .",
    "these agreements with theoretical studies support our assertion that the dispersive intra - band excitation we observe arises from @xmath25 .    on the other hand",

    "the rixs intensity around 1  ev decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath96 from 8.993 to 9.003  kev , while the main ct / mo peak shifts to higher energy .",
    "the incident energy of 9.003  kev we used provide a compromise between the disadvantage of decreasing intensity and the advantage of decreasing mo peak tail . however , theoretical calculations predict a monotonic increase of the @xmath25 contribution when @xmath96 changes from 8.993 to 9.003  kev ,  @xcite which disagrees with our observations .",
    "this implies that the rixs intensity inside the ct gap in the 8.993  kev data contains appreciable contribution from another type of excitation . in this",

    "et al . _ have hypothesized the excitation near 2  ev measured with 8.993  kev to be an inter - band excitation from a `` low - lying '' band below the fermi energy @xmath98 to the zhang - rice band .",
    "the incident and final polarization conditions of x - ray photons may also affect the @xmath96 dependence of the rixs intensity . however , rixs spectra with @xmath10  kev taken with different polarization conditions , namely the present data and those reported in ref .",

    "et al_.  @xcite reported weak polarization dependence of the cu-@xmath0 edge rixs spectra of nd@xmath22cuo@xmath99 .",
    "therefore , the polarization - dependence in cuprates is likely to be weak as well .",
    "though polarization dependence is not taken into account in the theoretical calculations mentioned , the disagreement regarding the enhanced intensity of the intra - band region at @xmath10  kev between theory and our experiments can be hardly attributed to polarization effects .",
    "more detailed investigations are needed to understand the @xmath96 dependence of the intra - band intensity .",
    "a characteristic feature in the 8.993  kev data is that the rixs intensity profiles at 1  ev have maxima at @xmath86 in the entire hole - doping range .",
    "previously we have hypothesized that this feature is related to the stripe ordered state,@xcite but as we show here the maximum structure appears in all samples regardless of the existence of charge stripe order .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that the maximum structure is originating directly from the stripe ordered phase .",
