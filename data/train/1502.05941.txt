    "while we measured the magnetic energy that is dissipated in large solar flares in paper i ( aschwanden , xu , and jing 2014a ) , the goal of this paper ii is the determination of thermal energies of the heated flare plasma , in order to study the energy partition of the input ( magnetic ) energy into various output ( thermal and other ) energies .",
    "a crucial test is the thermal to the magnetic energy ratio , which is expected to be less than unity for magnetic energy release processes ( such as magnetic reconnection ) .",
    "ratios in excess of unity would indicate either inaccurate energy measurements of either magnetic or thermal energies , or would challenge standard flare scenarios where the source of dissipated energy is entirely of magnetic origin . in the standard cshkp magnetic reconnection model ( carmichael 1964 ; sturrock 1966 ; hirayama 1974 ; kopp and pneuman 1976 ) , magnetic reconnection drives the nonlinear dissipation of magnetic energy , which is then converted partially into particle acceleration and ( precipitation - driven and conduction - driven ) flare plasma heating , for which the thermal energy is naturally expected to be a fraction of the total dissipated magnetic energy only .",
    "thus , statistical measurements of the thermal to magnetic energy ratio provide crucial tests for theoretical flare scenarios as well as on the accuracy of observational flare energy measurement methods .",
    "the problematics of determining magnetic energies has been discussed extensively in paper i. there are three forms of magnetic energies : the potential energy , the free energy ( or excess of nonpotential over potential energy ) , and the dissipated energy , which corresponds to the negative change of free energy during a flare event",
    ". therefore , the measurement of dissipated magnetic energies requires methods that accurately can detect deviations from the potential magnetic field , which are difficult to achieve , as a quantitative comparison of 12 nonlinear force - free field ( nlfff ) extrapolation methods of the photospheric magnetic field demonstrated ( derosa et al .",
    "alternative nlfff methods that use the geometry of ( automatically traced ) coronal loops as constraints appear to be more promising for this task ( paper i ) .",
    "there exists only one study that attempts to compare dissipated magnetic energies with thermal energies in a set of ( large eruptive ) flare events ( emslie et al .",
    "2012 ) , but the dissipated magnetic energy could not be determined in that study and instead was estimated to amount to @xmath14 of the potential energy , leading to a rather small thermal / magnetic energy ratio , in the order of @xmath15 . since the ratio of the dissipated magnetic energy @xmath3 to the potential magnetic energy @xmath16 has been found to have a substantially smaller value in paper i , in the range of @xmath17 for a representative set of m- and x - class flares , we suspect that the thermal / magnetic energy ratio is systematically underestimated in the study of emslie et al .",
    "( 2012 ) . as a consequence",
    ", we will see in the present study that the thermal / magnetic energy ratio in large solar flares is indeed significantly higher than previously inferred in emslie et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "even if we have an accurate method to determine the dissipated magnetic energy in solar flares , there are also large uncertainties in the determination of the thermal energy due to the inhomogeneity and multi - thermal nature of the solar flare plasma . in principle , an accurate measure of the multi - thermal energy could be determined if the full 3d distribution of electron temperatures @xmath18 and electron densities @xmath19 are known , such as produced in 3d magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations ( e.g. , testa et al .",
    "2012 ) . in practice , we have only 2d images in multiple wavelengths available to determine the thermal energy .",
    "while the lateral extent ( in the [ x , y]-plane ) of flare - related emission in euv and soft x - rays can be accurately measured for instruments with high spatial resolution , such as with aia / sdo , the line - of - sight column depth ( in @xmath20$]-direction ) is subject to geometric models .",
    "moreover , the differential emission measure distribution can only be determined as an integral along any line - of - sight , and thus the thermal inhomogeneity and filling factors along the line - of - sight add additional uncertainties .",
    "nevertheless , the presently available high - resolution and multi - wavelength capabilities of aia / sdo provide unprecedented possibilities to model the 3d flare plasma distribution with much higher fidelity than previous instruments from the the _ solar maximum mission ( smm ) _ , the _ solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) _ , the _ transition region and coronal explorer ( trace ) _ , and the _ solar - terrestrial relationship observatory ( stereo ) _ missions .",
    "it is therefore timely to attempt a statistical study of magnetic and thermal energies using aia and hmi data from sdo .",
    "the content of this paper ii includes a description of the data analysis methods to determine multi - thermal flare energies ( section 2 and appendix a ) , a presentation of observations and results ( section 3 and tables 1 and 2 ) , discussions of problems pertinent to the determination of thermal energies ( section 4 ) , and conclusions about thermal and magnetic flare energies ( section 5 ) .",
    "the temperature and density analysis carried out here uses euv images from the _ atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) _ ( lemen et al .",
    "2012 ; boerner et al .  2012 ) onboard the _ solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) _ spacecraft ( pesnell et al .  2012 ) .",
    "aia contains 10 different wavelength channels , three in white light and uv , and seven euv channels , whereof six wavelengths ( 94 , 131 , 171 , 193 , 211 , 335 ) are centered on strong iron lines ( fe viii , ix , xii , xiv , xvi , xviii ) , covering the coronal range from @xmath21 mk to @xmath22 mk . the 304  ( he _ ii _ ) filter was not used because it is mostly sensitive to chromospheric temperatures of @xmath23 , which is outside of the range of interest for the flare study here .",
    "the calibration of the response functions has changed somewhat over time . early on in the mission ,",
    "the response of the 94 and 131  channels was underestimated ( see fig .  10 in aschwanden and boerner 2011 ) . here",
    "we will use the currently available calibration , which was updated with improved atomic emissivities according to the chianti version 7 code , distributed in the _ solar software ( ssw ) _ _ interactive data language ( idl ) _ on 2012 february 13 .",
    "the measurement of the thermal energy @xmath24 of an ( isothermal ) flare plasma requires the determination of the electron density @xmath25 , the electron temperature @xmath26 , and the flare volume @xmath27 . from multi - wavelength observations it is customary to calculate the _ differential emission measure ( dem ) _ distribution function , which can be integrated over the coronal temperature range and yields a total emission measure @xmath28 , providing a mean electron density @xmath25 ( for unity filling factor ) and a mean dem peak temperature @xmath26 .",
    "the inference of the dem can be accomplished either by inversion of the observed fluxes using the instrumental response functions , or by forward - fitting of a suitable functional form of a dem distribution function .",
    "dem inversion methods are often unstable ( craig and brown 1976 ; judge et al .  1997 ; testa et al .",
    "2012 ; aschwanden et al .",
    "2015 ) , while forward - fitting methods are generally more robust , but require a suitable parameterization of an analytical function that has to satisfy an acceptable goodness - of - fit criterion .",
    "a comparison of 10 dem inversion and forward - fitting methods has been conducted in a recent study with simulated dems , using aia , the _ euv variability experiment ( eve ) _ , the _ ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi _ , and the _ geostationary orbiting earth satellite ( goes ) _ response functions ( aschwanden et al .",
    "2015 ) , where the performance of recent dem methods is discussed in more detail .",
    "one of the most robust choices of a dem function with a minimum of free parameters is a single gaussian ( in the logarithm of the temperature ) , which has 3 free parameters only and is defined by the peak emission measure @xmath29 , the dem peak temperature @xmath30 , and the logarithmic temperature width @xmath31 , where the dem parameter has the cgs - units of [ @xmath32 k@xmath33 , @xmath34 ^ 2 \\over 2 \\ w_t^2 }      \\right ) } \\ , \\ ] ] where the line - of - sight emission measure @xmath35 is the temperature integral over the gaussian dem ( in units of [ @xmath32 ] , @xmath37 the gaussian dem ( eq .  1 ) can be forward - fitted to the preflare background - subtracted observed fluxes @xmath38 in multiple wavelengths @xmath39 , @xmath40 where @xmath41 are the observed fluxes ( in units of dn / s ) in the wavelengths @xmath42 , @xmath43 are the observed background fluxes , @xmath38 are the background - subtracted fluxes , integrated over the entire flare area , @xmath44 is the instrumental response function of each wavelength filter @xmath39 ( in units of [ dn s@xmath45 @xmath46 per pixel ) , and the temperature integration is using discretized temperature intervals @xmath47 , which generally are chosen to be equidistant bins of the logarithmic temperature range .    in our dem",
    "forward - fitting algorithm we use a temperature range of @xmath48 mk that is subdivided equi - distantly into 36 logarithmic temperature bins @xmath47 , and a gaussian temperature width range with 10 values in the range of @xmath49 . at the same time",
    ", the dem peak emission measure value @xmath29 is evaluated from the median ratio of the observed to the model ( background - subtracted ) fluxes , @xmath50 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath51 @xmath32 k@xmath45 is the unity emission measure .",
    "the best - fitting values of the peak emission measure @xmath29 , the peak temperature @xmath30 and temperature width @xmath31 are found by a global search in the 2-parameter space @xmath52 $ ] and by adjustment of the peak emission measure value @xmath29 .",
    "the best - fit solution is then evaluated by the goodness - of - fit criterion ( e.g. , bevington and robinson 1992 ) , @xmath53^{1/2 } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath54 are the 6 observed flux values , @xmath55 are the flux values of the fitted gaussian dem ( eq .  1 ) , @xmath56 are the estimated uncertainties , @xmath57 is the number of degrees of freedom , which is @xmath58 for @xmath59 the number of wavelength filters and @xmath60 the number of model parameters .    in recent studies",
    "it is found that the dominant uncertainty in fitting fluxes observed with aia / sdo comes from the incomplete knowledge of the aia response functions , which concerns missing atomic lines in the chianti code as well as uncertainties whether photospheric or coronal abundances of chemical elements are more appropriate .",
    "the combined uncertainty is estimated to be @xmath61 of the observed aia fluxes in each wavelength ( boerner et al .",
    "2014 ; testa et al .  2012",
    "; aschwanden et al .",
    "this is much more than the typical uncertainty due to photon count statistics , which is of order @xmath62 for typical aia count rates ( @xmath63 dn s@xmath45 ) during flares ( boerner et al .",
    "2014 ; odwyer et al .",
    "we thus perform the dem forward - fitting to the 6 wavelength fluxes by using the empirical 10% error of the response functions as an estimate of the flux uncertainties due to calibration and background subtraction errors , @xmath64      the choice of a suitable dem function in forward - fitting methods is almost an art . a gaussian function ( in the logarithm of the temperature ) appears to be a good approximation near the peak temperature @xmath30 of most dem functions , but can not represent `` shoulders '' of the primary peak , or secondary peaks at lower or higher temperatures .",
    "this is particularly a problem for euv images that have many different temperature structures with competing emission measures in different areas of the image , such as multiple cores of hot flaring regions , surrounded by peripheral cooler regions .",
    "therefore it is a sensible approach in the dem parameterization to subdivide the image area of a flare into macropixels or even single pixels , and then to perform a forward - fit of a ( single - gaussian ) dem function in each spatial location separately , while the total dem distribution function of the entire flare area can then be constructed by summing all dem functions from each spatial location , which we call the `` spatial synthesis dem '' method .",
    "this way , the gaussian approximation of a dem function is applied locally only , but can adjust different peak emission measures and temperatures at each spatial location .",
    "such a single - pixel algorithm for automated temperature and emission measure analysis has been developed for the 6 coronal aia wavelength filter images in aschwanden et al .",

    "this synthesized dem function can be arbitrarily complex and accomodate a different gaussian dem function in every spatial location @xmath80 .",
    "typically we process images with a field - of - view of @xmath81 solar radius , which corresponds to about 520 aia pixels . subdividing these images into macropixels with a bin size of 4 full - resolution pixels",
    ", we have a grid of 130@xmath82130 macropixels @xmath83 $ ] and perform @xmath84 single - gaussian dem fits per time frame , per wavelength set , and per event .",
    "we illustrate the spatial synthesis procedure with single - gaussian dems in fig .  1 , where we can see that the local temperature discrimination yields a higher temperature contrast for increasingly smaller macropixels , from @xmath85 down to 2 image pixels . the convergence of the dem with decreasing bin size is depicted in fig .  2 , for three different times of a flare .",
    "the initial single - gaussian dem function fitted to the fluxes of a @xmath86 pixel area ( blue curves in fig .",
    "2 ) converges to a double - peaked dem at the flare peak time ( red curve in middle panel of fig.2 ) , synthesized from @xmath87 macropixels , which evolves then into a broad single - peaked dem in the postflare phase ( red curve in bottom panel of fig .  2 ) .",
    "the total emission measure em of a flaring active region , such as defined for a single gaussian dem ( eq .  2 ) or for a spatially synthesized dem as defined in eq .  (",
    "10 ) , yield the product of the squared mean electron density times the flare volume .",
    "if we can estimate the flare volume @xmath27 from the imaging information , we can then infer the mean electron density ( for unity filling factor ) .",
    "there are many ways to measure a flare area .",
    "two major problems are the choice of a suitable wavelength ( in multi - temperature data ) , and secondly the choice of a threshold , especially in flares that have a large dynamic range of fluxes over several orders of magnitude .    in order to eliminate the choice of wavelengths",
    ", we use the emission measure maps @xmath88 ( eq .  7 ) , where we find a range of @xmath89 @xmath32 k@xmath45 for the peak values .",
    "we choose an emission measure threshold near the lower bound of this range , i.e. , @xmath90 @xmath32 k@xmath45 , unless this threshold exceeds the 50% level of the peak emission measure , in which case we use the 50% level . this way , a flare area is always defined , even for flares with low emission measures .",
    "we measure then the flare area @xmath91 of thermal emission by counting the number of macropixels above the threshold in an emission measure map @xmath92 , which multiplied with the macropixel size yields an area @xmath91 ( in units of @xmath93 ) , a length scale @xmath94 , and a flare volume @xmath95 .",
    "one problem that we encountered in our analysis is that the flare area at the peak time @xmath96 is sometimes largely inflated due to saturation of the euv ccd , pixel bleeding , and diffraction patterns , and thus no reliable flare area @xmath97 can be measured at the flare peak time @xmath98 .",
    "since the automated exposure control alternates between short and long exposure times during saturation , an over - exposed time frame ( with flare area @xmath97 at the peak time @xmath98 ) is interpolated from the preceding time step ( with flare area @xmath99 at time @xmath100 ) and the following time step ( with flare area @xmath101 at time @xmath102 . in the derivation of geometric parameters in this study we use the maximum flare area",
    "@xmath103 $ ] measured during the flare duration interval .",
    "if we substitute the expression of the total emission measure at the peak time @xmath104 of the flare , @xmath105 , into the expression for the thermal energy @xmath2 , we have the relationship @xmath106 this expression is accurate only if the dem function is a delta - function with a small thermal width @xmath31 , which can then be characterized by the peak emission measure @xmath29 at the dem peak temperature @xmath30 .    for every broad temperature dem distribution @xmath73 , as it is the case for most solar flares , it is more accurate to perform the temperature integral ( or summation over discrete temperature increments @xmath47 , which may be logarithmically binned ) . in the discretized form",

    "this yields a more accurate value of the total multi - thermal energy , since it avoids a truncation at the high - temperature tail of the composite dem distribution .",
    "note that we defined the thermal energy in terms of the volume - integrated total emission measure ( @xmath112 ( in units of @xmath8 ) , in contrast to the column depth integrated emission measure per area , @xmath113 ( in units of @xmath32 ) used in the spatial synthesis method ( eq .  7 ) , where the emission measure is quantified per unit area or per image pixel ( see detailed derivation in appendix a ) .",
    "we find that the more accurate expression of eq .",
    "( 12 ) typically yields a factor of @xmath0 higher values for the thermal energies than the single - temperature approximation of eq .  ( 11 ) , and thus represents a very important correction for broad multi - temperature dems .",
    "considering the more complex dem functions obtained from spatial synthesis with eq .",
    "( 9 ) , we will see that the dem function often has multiple peaks , and thus it does not make any sense anymore to talk about a single peak emission measure @xmath29 and single peak temperature @xmath30 . in order to characterize such complex dem functions with a characteristic temperature value",
    ", it makes more sense to define an emission measure - weighted temperature @xmath114 , which we define as , @xmath115 and approximately characterizes the `` centroid '' of the dem function .",

    "aia provides euv images from four @xmath116 detectors with a pixel size of @xmath117 , corresponding to an effective spatial resolution of @xmath118 .",
    "we generally use a subimage with a field - of - view of @xmath119 .",
    "aia records a full set of near - simultaneous images in each temperature filter with a fixed cadence of 12 seconds , while our analysis of the flare evolution is done in time increments of @xmath120 hrs .",
    "this cadence may underestimate the maximum thermal energy during a flare in some cases , but is estimated to be less than a factor of 2 .",
    "an example of our dem analysis is summarized in fig .  3 , which applies to the first event ( # 1 ) of our list , a goes m2.0 class flare in active region noaa 11081 at n23 w47 , observed with aia / sdo on 2010 june 12 , 00:00 - 01:30 ut .",

    "we will discuss the rtv scaling law , which we apply to model the otherwise unknown scaling of the energy with the volume , @xmath179 .",
    "a well - known physical scaling law between hydrodynamic parameters of a coronal loop is the rosner - tucker - vaiana law ( rosner et al .  1978 ) ,",

    "this is related to the incompatibility of iso - thermal temperatures inferred from goes , aia , and rhessi data , investigated in a recent study ( ryan et al .",
    "2014 ) , which can only be ameliorated with broadband ( multi - temperature ) dem distributions .",
    "the systematic underestimate of the thermal energy , when the isothermal approximation is used , may also be the reason why a very low value of @xmath231 ( fig .",

    "the thermal energy depends on the volume @xmath27 , and thus the measurement of flare areas or volumes are crucial to obtain an accurate energy value . since we can directly observe in 2d images the flare area @xmath91 only , the definition of a flare volume @xmath27 is subject to modeling .",
    "the simplest definition is the euclidean relationship @xmath233 and @xmath94 , but more complicated definitions involve the fractal dimension ( aschwanden and aschwanden 2008a , b ) , 3d filling factors ( aschwanden and aschwanden 2008b ) , or other geometric concepts to characterize the inhomogeneity of flare plasmas . one prominent modeling concept is the hydrostatic density scale height @xmath234 , which depends on the flare plasma temperature @xmath235 and can be used to estimate the vertical height above the solar surface .",
    "the detailed geometry of the flare plasma often appears to have the geometry of an arcade of loops , which can be highly inhomogeneous , depending on the spatial intermittency of precipitating electrons along the flare ribbons .",
    "nevertheless , regardless how complicated the spatial topology of a flare is , the thermal energy is a volume integral and thus should be rotation - invariant to the aspect angle or heliographic location ( assuming that we measure correct dems along each line - of - sight ) .",
    "this argument justifies isotropic geometries such as hemispheric flare volumes ( aschwanden and shimizu 2013 ) , or the related euclidean relationship @xmath236 .",
    "moreover , the height @xmath237 of semi - circular flare loops is about half of the footpoint separation @xmath150 , and thus the volume @xmath238 can be approximated with a cube @xmath236 .",
    "hence , we use the simple euclidean relationships @xmath233 and @xmath94 in this paper . detailed geometric 3d modeling of the flare volume at different temperatures is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "how consistent is the flare volume measurement in the present work with previous studies ?",
    "most flare area measurements are done using a flux threshold , which is chosen above the data noise level and lower than the maximum flux in an image , but is arbitrary within this range . the volume of limb flares from skylab data ( pallavicini et al .  1977 ) was calculated from measuring the height and size of bright soft x - ray emission in photographs and yields a remarkable good match for the isothermal energy with our present study ( blue line and crosses in fig .",
    "the previous study of 155 m- and x - class flares with aia / sdo data ( aschwanden and shimizu 2013 ) involved multiple flux threshold levels and was combined from 6 different wavelength filters , but is consistent with the area measurements in this study within a factor of @xmath239 .",

    "numerical integrations of the dem temperature distribution show that multi - thermal dems yield in the average 14 times higher ( multi-)thermal energies than isothermal ( delta - function - like ) dem distributions ( fig .",
    "thus , the fidelity of the dem reconstruction is important for the accurate determination of thermal flare energies .    in this study",
    "we employed the spatial synthesis dem method ( section 2.3 and aschwanden et al .",
    "2013 ) , which approximates the dem in every ( macro-)pixel with a 3-parameter gaussian dem function , which is then synthesized for the entire flare volume by adding all partial dem distributions from each pixel . in fig .  2 we demonstrated that this method converges to a unique dem solution by iterating from large macro - pixels to smaller sizes , down to a single image pixel",
    "we find that this method converges rapidly , when iterating macro - pixel sizes @xmath241 , @xmath242 , on an image with full size @xmath243 ( figs .  1 and 2 ) .",
    "this means that macropixels with a size of a few pixels isolate hot flare areas and ambient cooler plasma areas sufficiently to be characterized with a single - peaked dem function .",
    "the fast convergence to a unique dem function is very fortunate and relieves us from more sophisticated dem modeling .",
    "we find that the largest uncertainty in dem modeling comes from uncertainties of the instrumental response functions , including missing atomic lines , chemical abundance variations , and preflare - background subtraction , which all combined are estimated to be of order @xmath61 ( boerner et al .",

    "the observational measurements of ( multi - thermal ) energies were found indeed to match this predicted relationship closely ( see correlation between theoretically predicted and observed thermal energies in fig .",
    "let us consider the parameters of the most extreme events .",
    "for the largest flare in our dataset , we found a length scale of @xmath245 mm @xmath246 solar radius , the hottest flare has an ( emission measure - weighted ) temperature of @xmath247 mk , and the most energetic flare has a multi - thermal energy of @xmath248 erg .",
    "the upper limit for thermal energies is of particular interest for predictions of the most extreme ( and worst events for space weather and astronauts ) .",
    "based on the largest flare events observed in history , with a goes - class of x10 to x17 , an even larger maximum flare energy of @xmath249 erg was estimated , while stellar flares may range up to @xmath250 erg ( see fig .  3 in schrijver et al .",
    "2012 ) .    on the other extreme , the rtv scaling law ( eq .  24 ) may also be applied to predict the magnitude of the smallest coronal flare events .",
    "an absolute lower limit of flare temperatures is the temperature of the ambient solar corona , which is approximately @xmath251 mk . for a lower limit of the spatial size of a flare event we can use the size of the smallest loop that sticks out of the chromosphere , which has a height of @xmath252 mm and a semi - circular loop length of @xmath253 mm .",
    "the apex segment that sticks out of the chromosphere can have a projected length scale as short as @xmath254 mm .",
    "the extrapolated thermal energy of the smallest flare is then estimated to be @xmath255 erg , which is about 9 orders of magnitude smaller than the largest flare , and thus called a nanoflare .",

    "we measured the size distributions of spatio - temporal physical parameters in solar flares ( length @xmath150 , area @xmath91 , volume @xmath27 , durations @xmath152 ) and found indeed agreement with the predictions of the standard fd - soc model ( fig .",
    "the size distributions of the other physical parameters ( @xmath30 , @xmath199 , @xmath29 , @xmath2 ) , however , are not universal , but depend on the underlying physical process of the soc phenomenon . for solar flares in particular , we found that the rtv scaling law is consistent with the observed parameter correlations and size distributions .",
    "most of the physical scaling laws are expressed in terms of powerlaw exponents ( such as the thermal energy , i.e. , @xmath258 ) , which has the consequence that all size distributions of physical parameters are also predicted to have a powerlaw shape , except for finite - size effects ( that produce a steep drop - off at the upper end ) and incomplete sampling due to limited sensitivity ( which produces a turnover at the lower end ) , as manifested in the size distributions shown in fig .",

    "size distributions show , is the scale - free parameter range ( also called inertial range ) of soc processes over which an identical physical process governs nonlinear energy dissipation .",
    "the size distributions shown in fig .",
    "6 exhibit no indication of multiple or broken powerlaws in the inertial range of m- and x - class flares .",
    "note that such powerlaw distributions occur only for statistically complete samples ( above some threshold value ) .",
    "datasets with `` hand - selected '' events ( such as the 37 eruptive flare events sampled in emslie et al .",
    "2012 ) do not exhibit powerlaw - like size distributions .",

    "such composite size distributions have been used to characterize the overall size distributions from the smallest nanoflare to the largest x - class flare .",
    "however , the construction of a synthesized flare energy size distribution requires a consistent definition of energy , which is not the case in most of the published studies , since they contain thermal as well as nonthermal energies . in order to illustrate this discrepancy we show the cumulative size distributions of isothermal , multi - thermal , and magnetic flare energies in fig .",
    "10 , where we sample an identical event list , which is the common subset of the three energy forms and contains 171 events . in fig .",
    "10 we show a cumulative size distribution of these events , constructed with the inverse rank - order plot .",
    "note that the three different forms of energy differ by an approximate amount of @xmath259 and @xmath260 .",
    "it is therefore imperative to derive the same form of energy when comparing the occurrence probabilities from the size distributions of different datasets .      one key result of this study is the thermal / magnetic energy ratio , for which we found a range of @xmath1 .",
    "we consider this result to be a substantial improvement over previous estimates , where isothermal instead of multi - thermal temperature distributions were used and no measurements of magnetically dissipated energies were available , resulting into a much lower estimate of the thermal energy content in the order of @xmath261 ( emslie et al .",
    "the thermal energy is smaller than the magnetically dissipated energy for essentially all events ( fig .",
    "8a ) , while the few mavericks can be explained by inaccurate energy measurements , either on the thermal or magnetic part .",
    "this result is certainly consistent with most magnetic reconnection models ( where magnetic energy is converted into acceleration of particles ) and the thick - target model ( where the accelerated particles lose their energy by precipitation down to the chromosphere and heat up the chromospheric plasma ) .",
    "the amount of energy that goes into chromospheric and coronal plasma heating may well be larger than the thermal energy measured here , because we measured only the thermal energy content at the peak time of the flare , while multiple heating phases may occur before and after the flare peak .",
    "even if we would add up all thermal energies from every flare episode that shows a subpeak in the soft or hard x - ray time profile , we would still underestimate the thermal energy because ( radiative and conductive ) cooling processes are not considered in the calculation of the thermal energy content here .",
    "thus , the multi - thermal energy content calculated here represents only a lower limit of the heating energy that goes into flare plasma heating during a flare .",
    "a complete calculation of the multi - thermal flare energy would require a forward - fitting method of the evolution of the heating rate @xmath262 that fits the observed conductive @xmath263 and radiative energy loss rate @xmath264 , which is beyond the scope of this study , since this would require realistic geometric 3d models of flare loop arcades also .",
    "as part of a global flare energetics study that encompasses all forms of energies that are converted during solar flares ( with or without cmes ) we calculated the dissipated magnetic energy of 172 goes m- and x - class events ( in paper i ) , and the multi - thermal energy at the peak time of 391 flare events ( in this paper ii here ) .",

    "this method is found to be robust and converges as a function of the macro - pixel size to a unique dem solution , subject to uncertainties in terms of the instrumental response function and subtracted background fluxes in the order of @xmath265 .",
    "the multi - thermal dem function yields a significantly higher ( typically by a factor of @xmath0 , but comprehensive , ( multi-)thermal energy than the isothermal energy estimated from the same data .",
