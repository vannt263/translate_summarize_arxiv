    "since its discovery by huygens when observing coupled pendula in the 17th century  @xcite , synchronization has been described in physics , chemistry , biology and even social behavior  @xcite , becoming a paradigm for research of collective dynamics .",
    "it has been thoroughly studied in classical nonlinear dynamical systems  @xcite , and extended to chaotic ones  @xcite . only recently synchronization has been studied in quantum systems , e.g. ,",
    "two coupled quantum harmonic oscillators  @xcite , a qubit coupled to a quantum dissipative driven oscillator  @xcite , two dissipative spins  @xcite , and two coupled cavities  @xcite .",
    "last year , connections between quantum entanglement and synchronization have been discussed in continuous variable systems  @xcite .",
    "a decade ago , hampton and zanette introduced a new concept termed measure synchronization ( ms ) for coupled hamiltonian systems  @xcite .",
    "they found that two coupled hamiltonian systems experience a synchronization transition from a state in which the two subsystems visit different phase space regions to a state in which `` their orbits cover the same region of the phase space with identical invariant measures ''  @xcite .",
    "the control parameter is the coupling strength between the two subsystems .",
    "the key difference between ms and conventional synchronization is that ms takes place in absence of dissipation . in",
    "standard synchronization dissipation plays a key role , as it is responsible for the collapse of any trajectory of the system in phase space . for",
    "coupled hamiltonian systems , phase space volume must be conserved following liouville s theorem , thus preventing the collapse of any trajectory in phase space . in the case of ms ,",
    "two coupled hamiltonian systems become synchronized when they cover the same phase space domain , without requiring that the synchronized systems have the same evolution trajectories .    in this article",
    "we introduce measure synchronization , a concept up to now only considered in a classical framework , into the quantum many - body regime .",
    "first exploratory studies of measure synchronization in quantum systems have been done in different contexts , i.e. , ms has been discussed in coupled hamiltonian systems associated with nonlinear schrdinger equations  @xcite ; also , ms transitions have been revealed on meanfield theories describing condensed bosonic quantum many - body systems  @xcite .",
    "however , it is worth stressing that in the above cases the dynamical variables describing these quantum systems are classical , i.e. quantum fluctuations are neglected , a reasonable approximation in bosonic systems which are fully condensed  @xcite",
    ". this made the correspondence between the classical ms concept introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and the ms studies of these quantum systems straightforward .",
    "so conceptually , measure synchronization discussed in these contexts remained classical .",
    "here , we tackle the problem in a fully many - body quantum mechanical way .",
    "a major conceptual difference is that , in the general case we need to identify quantum many - body observables which allow us to characterize ms - like behaviors provided the very definition of the area covered by each subsystem in phase space is absent .",
    "we consider two quantum many - body systems ( qmbs ) which are coupled through a local interaction term .",
    "our main finding is that we characterize a crossover behavior from non - ms to ms in the evolution of the quantum many - body properties of the subsystems .",
    "this implies that two qmbs , which if non coupled would develop different quantum correlations , will , if sufficiently coupled , have similar condensed fractions , particle fluctuations , etc .",
    "this is an effect which will affect the behavior of future qmbs and quantum simulators , and which , if properly controlled , can be employed to share or to induce quantum correlations between different degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "ms is a dynamical feature which we will show to appear in the evolution of qmbs .",
    "it describes how , under certain premises , the dynamics of two weakly coupled quantum subsystems becomes coherent after a short transient time .",
    "ms describes how two subsets of a qmbs will evolve in a collective way , exchanging energy during the full evolution , exploring similar average values of relevant observables and developing similar quantum correlations .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that our ability to understand and utterly control quantum correlations in qmbs is the key to producing powerful technological applications .",
    "a notable recent example is the case of pseudo - spin squeezed states  @xcite , which can be produced in bosonic josephson junctions  @xcite . in this case , producing fragmented ultracold gases is shown to notably raise the precision achievable in quantum metrology experiments  @xcite .",
    "these applications will become a reality in the near future thanks to the miniaturization of ultracold atomic systems  @xcite .",
    "as shown here , ms can be used to transfer , or sympathetically produce , fragmentation in one subsytem of the qmbs which can , for instance , improve interferometric signals .    the article is organized in the following way . in sec .",

    ", however , both domains completely overlap .",
    "this feature can be regarded as the many - body counterpart of the classical definition of ms , in which the phase space domain covered by both subsystems is the same .    in classical systems",
    "ms implies that both subsystems have similar long - time averages of their energies .",
    "importantly , the non - ms to ms transition in classical systems is discontinuous , which allows one to define a critical point to characterize the dynamical phase transition  @xcite .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where we depict the average energy @xmath72 and @xmath73 as a function of the interspecies interaction @xmath18 , with @xmath74 characterizing ms .",
    "the classical results  @xcite , depicted in green and blue , feature the known discontinuity . in the many - body case",
    "the situation is different ; the dynamical phase transition is replaced by a crossover behavior , therefore no critical point can be unambiguously defined .",
    "there is no criticality which involves logarithmic singularity in the quantum measure synchronization as compared with classical theory of measure synchronization  @xcite .",

    ". this fragmentation also takes place if there is no coupling between the subsystems  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in the ms dynamics , the condensed fraction of both subsystems gets clearly correlated after a very short transient time , having the same envelope of the oscillation amplitudes , which is a key feature of ms .",

    "this similar behavior is also exhibited in the dispersions of particle differences [ fig .",

    "an important application which can be envisaged is to profit from the ms described here to build targeted quantum correlations of certain degrees of freedom in the system in a sympathetic way .",
