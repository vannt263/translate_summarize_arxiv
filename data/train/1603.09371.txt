    "therefore the situation is similar to the isolated vortex inside superfluid at high temperature.we can examine the phase transition by solving dyson - schwinger equation for the fermion self - energy for chiral condensate and its destruction by vortices.in this model chern - simons term is absorbed to parity odd part of the gauge boson propagator and gauge boson acquires a mass.pure qed part of gauge boson contributes to the condensation of @xmath2,while the latter may wash away the condensate at zero temperature.these are the main goals of our analysises.in 4-dimensional representation of spinor we have chiral symmetry for massless fermion.if it breaks dynamically we have two kinds of mass as chiral symmetry breaking and parity violation.for infinitesimal value of the topological mass it has been pointed out by k.i.kondo and p.maris that chiral symmetry restores and parity violating phase remains within @xmath3 expansion and nonlocal gauge of dyson - schwinger equation @xcite , raya,@xcite.here we consider weak coupling and gauge covariant approximation which satisfy ward - takahashi relation at first.after that we examine the @xmath3 expansion in the landau gauge.in the final section we evaluate the spectral function of the fermion propagator @xcite,@xcite .this method is helpful to determine the infrared behaviour or one particle singularity of the propagator in the existence of massless boson as photon , which has been known in qed@xmath4.since qed@xmath5 is super renormalizable we get a short distance behaviour of the fermion propagator too.as a result we show the effect of vortex on the lowest order spectral function of parity even scalar part of the propagator.so that we find the critical value of topological mass above which chiral condensate is washed away .",

    "<S> there is chiral like symmetry for 4-component massless fermion in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gauge theory.since qed@xmath0 with chern - simons term contains vortex solution for vector potential , one may expect vortex driven phase transition as kosterlitz - thouless type where chiral condensate is washed away at zero temperature.to study this possibility , we evaluate the fermion propagator by dyson - schwinger equation numerically and spectral function analytically in the landau gauge.for quenched case we adopt ball - chiu vertex to keep gauge invariance of the results.the critical value of topological mass , above which chiral condensate washed away , turned out to be @xmath1 at least for weak coupling in both cases . </S>"
