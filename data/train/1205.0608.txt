    "since the discovery of the current accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite , many efforts have been made to explain the physical essence behind this phenomenon of acceleration @xcite . within the framework of the general relativity , the acceleration can be attributed to the existence of a mysterious negative pressure component named phenomenally as dark energy . a positive cosmological constant , which fits to the observations",
    "well , is currently still the simplest candidate for dark energy .",
    "however , it is plagued with the fine - tuning problem and the coincidence problem @xcite . according to the holographic principle @xcite that the number of degrees of freedom of a physical system scales with the area of its boundary rather than its volume .",
    "this might indicate that degrees of freedom are overcounted in the calculation of the vacuum energy in effective field theory .",
    "the author in @xcite suggested that the ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff @xmath22 in the effective field theory should be related to the infrared ( ir ) cutoff @xmath23 due to the limit set by the formation of a black hole , i.e. , in terms of the natural units , @xmath24 where @xmath25 with @xmath26 the newton s  constant .",
    "such relation leads to a dramatic depletion of quantum states , which results in a much small vacuum energy density , @xmath27 when the ir cutoff @xmath23 is comparable to the current hubble radius , the fine - tuning problem of the cosmological constant would not exist @xcite .",
    "some interesting studies on cosmology with holography have been carried out @xcite . in ref.@xcite , we have shown that when the ir cutoff @xmath23 is characterized by the total comoving horizon of the universe , the inflation @xcite in early universe makes the vacuum energy given in eq.([vac ] ) behave as a cosmological constant without the fine - tuning problem as well as the coincidence problem , which provided an interesting insight on the cosmological constant as the simplest and best candidate for the dark energy . in alternative ,",
    "we have found in @xcite that when the ir cutoff @xmath23 is taken to be a conformal - age - like length , the dark energy density given by the vacuum energy in eq.([vac ] ) is almost insensitive to the inflation in early universe .    in the spirit of the holographic principle @xcite ,",
    "some interesting holographic dark energy models in which the dark energy density is assumed to scale as @xmath28 with @xmath23 being some characteristic length scale of the universe have been proposed and studied by many groups @xcite .",
    "particularly , the first holographic dark energy model ( hde ) was proposed in @xcite by identifying @xmath23 with the radius of the future event horizon , i.e. @xmath29 , here @xmath30 is the scale factor of the universe at cosmic time @xmath31 .",
    "alternatively , the total comoving horizon @xmath32 including the very large primordial part generated by inflation was taken in @xcite as the ir cutoff to establish the so - called @xmath21hde model , as a consequence , the holographic dark energy behaves almost like a cosmological constant . on the other hand , a conformal - age - like length @xmath33 motivated from the four dimensional spacetime volume at cosmic time @xmath31 of the flat frw universe was adopted in @xcite to build the holographic type dark energy model(chde ) .",
    "based on different physical origin , the age @xmath34 of the universe is chosen as the ir cutoff to construct the agegraphic dark energy model(ade ) in @xcite , its improved new version(nade ) was proposed with replacing the age of the universe by the conformal age @xmath35 of the universe @xcite .    from the above considerations ,",
    "it is interesting to investigate a general class of holographic type dark energy models with the characteristic length scale given by the following form @xmath36 here we will focus on the case with @xmath15 , @xmath37 being the integers . obviously , the ade model @xcite corresponds to the case @xmath38 ; the @xmath21hde model @xcite corresponds to @xmath39 , while the nade model @xcite corresponds to the same case but without considering a primordial part generated by inflation@xcite ; the chde model @xcite corresponds to @xmath40 .    in this note",
    ", we are going to investigate in detail a general class of holographic type dark energy models characterized by the ir cutoff given in eq.([l0 ] ) .",
    "our main purpose is to see the possible holographic type dark energy candidates for various cases of @xmath41 by requiring the corresponding models to be self - consistent and also consistent with the expansion history of the universe . in particular",
    ", we will show which cases are more favorable .",
    "in sec.ii , we first present a description on the general class of holographic type dark energy models , and then we make a detail investigation on various models and find out the possible candidates for the various choices @xmath41 ; in sec.iii , we will mainly focus on the single - parameter models similar to the @xmath7cdm model and perform the best - fit analysis by using recent cosmological observations ; some concluding remarks and discussions are given in sec.iv .",
    "let us begin with the general characteristic length scale of the universe @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the hubble parameter and @xmath44 denotes the derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath31 .",
    "the corresponding holographic type dark energy density is parameterized by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a positive constant parameter .",
    "the fractional energy density is defined by @xmath47    for simplicity , let us consider a flat friedmann - robertson - walker  ( frw ) universe containing the holographic type dark energy and ambient constituent with constant equation of state ( eos ) @xmath2 .",
    "the friedmann equation is given by @xmath48 or in fractional energy densities @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "if there is no direct energy interchange , each energy component is conservative respectively , which results in conservation equations given by @xmath51 with @xmath52 . by using eqs.([l ] ) ,",
    "( [ rho ] ) , ( [ frho ] ) and ( [ ceq ] ) , the eos of the holographic type dark energy is found to be @xmath53 cosmic acceleration requires that @xmath54 recently , which indicates @xmath55 or equivalently @xmath56 as @xmath15 is taken to be integer under our present consideration .",
    "the conservation of the ambient constituent with constant @xmath2 leads to @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a constant coefficient . combining with the friedmann equation and the definition of fractional energy densities",
    ", we have @xmath59 by using eqs.([l ] ) and ( [ frho ] ) , we get @xmath60 substituting eq.([ha ] ) into above equation and taking derivative with respect to @xmath61 in both sides , we arrive at the differential equation of motion for @xmath62 @xmath63    obviously , under the transformation @xmath64 , with taking @xmath65 as the present scale factor of the universe , the energy density eq.([rho ] ) , the fractional energy density eq.([frho ] ) , the eos eq.([wde ] ) and the differential equation eq.([ode ] ) are all invariant .",
    "namely , performing such transformation , all expressions keep the same , so we can set @xmath66 . from now on",
    ", we adopt that the parameter @xmath46 has absorbed a factor @xmath67 and set @xmath66 .",
    "note that the subscript``0 '' always indicates the present value of the corresponding quantity .",
    "considering that our universe has successively experienced the inflation during which @xmath68 ( which indicates quasi - de sitter expansion ) , the radiation - dominated epoch during which @xmath69 , and the matter - dominated epoch during which @xmath70 before turning to accelerated expansion recently , we are actually able to approximately study the behaviors of @xmath23 , thus the fractional density @xmath62 in the early universe directly . here , we will simply ignore the effect due to the transition from one ambient - constituent - dominated epoch to another ambient - constituent - dominated epoch .",
    "let us define @xmath71 where the subscript @xmath72 denotes the beginning of some epoch under consideration . obviously , we have @xmath73",
    "when the constituent with constant @xmath2 dominates the universe from @xmath74 , we have approximately @xmath75 from fridemann equations , which results in the following consequences @xmath76 noticing that the approximation in the limit @xmath77 is due to the fact that @xmath78 and @xmath79    when @xmath80 , then @xmath81 all the time in the early universe . from eqs.([lw ] ) and ( [ lw2 ] ) , we have @xmath82 for the constituent with constant @xmath2 dominating the universe . during the inflation ,",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath83 is constant approximately and the universe expands exponentially .",
    "those terms with the factor @xmath84 will soon become negligible , we have @xmath85 approximately , which also results in @xmath86 at the end of the inflation . approximately , for the radiation dominated epoch , the initial value @xmath87 is at the order of @xmath88 . referring to eq.([lwneq ] ) for @xmath81 and reminding that the expansion of the universe , we have @xmath89 for radiation - dominated epoch during which @xmath90 as well .",
    "similar result holds during the matter - dominated era . by using @xmath73 and eq.([frho ] ) , we get the approximate fraction of dark energy in early universe , i.e. @xmath91 where @xmath68 during inflation , @xmath90 in radiation - dominated epoch and @xmath92 in matter - dominated epoch respectively . for self - consistency , we need @xmath93 to ensure that @xmath94 when @xmath95 , thus the ambient matter dominated the early universe .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that for @xmath93 , eq.([frhom ] ) is the approximate solution of the differential equation of @xmath62 under the limit @xmath96 when @xmath95 consistently .    for the case @xmath97 , from eqs.([lw ] ) and ( [ lw2 ] ) , we simply have @xmath98 during inflation . while the approximate solution in matter- or radiation - dominated epoch is also given by eq.([frhom ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath93 is also required to be self - consistent .",
    "let us now pay attention to the case @xmath99 .",
    "in this case , we have @xmath100 at the matter - dominated epoch , which is the exact solution of the differential equation . referring to the eos of dark energy eq.([wde ] ) , we get @xmath101 which means that the holographic type dark energy tracks the dominated component and never dominates .",
    "this is of course unacceptable . moreover ,",
    "unless the parameter @xmath46 is small enough , the faction of dark energy would be too large in early universe to be consistent with primordial nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite .",
    "while by referring to the eos eq.([wde ] ) , a tiny @xmath46 would make the present eos of dark energy @xmath102 severely deviating from @xmath103 and be inconsistent with recent observations @xcite .    for the case @xmath104 ,",
    "then @xmath105 holds all the time in the early universe . from eqs.([lw ] ) , ( [ lw2 ] ) and eq.([lwneq ] ) , we have in early universe @xmath106 combining with @xmath73 and @xmath75 , we get the fraction of dark energy in early universe when @xmath107 @xmath108 as it is analyzed above that @xmath109 is required by recent cosmic acceleration , we then have @xmath94 when @xmath95 consistently for @xmath110 here .",
    "the scaling property of @xmath62 with respect to @xmath61 can also be resulted from the differential equation of @xmath62 under the limit @xmath111 when @xmath112 .",
    "this is because in light of the above equation the last factor in the differential equation eq.([ode ] ) is found to be @xmath113 which is negligible small .    for the cases @xmath114 and @xmath115",
    ", we can also obtain consistently eq.([frhom2 ] ) for @xmath56 during the inflation by following the same argument for the case @xmath104 . while for the radiation- and matter - dominated era , more attention is needed .",
    "let us rewrite @xmath116 in the following way , @xmath117 where subscripts @xmath118 and @xmath119 denote the beginning and the end of inflation respectively . from eq.([lw2 ] ) , it is not difficult to find that the second term @xmath120 is approximately at order of @xmath121 for the cases @xmath114 and @xmath115 , while the first term is given by @xmath122 in order to solve the horizon problem @xcite , the inflation is required to last enough time to make @xmath123 moreover , due to the fact that @xmath124 has been growing as @xmath125 until recent cosmic acceleration ( from then on , @xmath126 ) , we generally have @xmath127 when @xmath128 .",
    "thus for @xmath129 , we yield @xmath130 which indicates that for the cases @xmath114 and @xmath115 , the first term in eq.([tl12 ] ) is much larger than the second term .",
    "thus we approximately have @xmath131 in the radiation- and matter - dominated epoch",
    ". therefore , eq.([frhom2 ] ) also holds at these two epoches for @xmath109 and @xmath114 or @xmath115 .",
    "it is noticed that for the case @xmath132 and @xmath4 the characteristic scale @xmath23 will be dominated by the primordial part generated in inflation with referring to eqs.([l ] ) , ( [ lw2 ] ) , ( [ neq2 ] ) , i.e. @xmath133 in the radiation- and matter - dominated epoch .",
    "then the dark energy behaves almost like a cosmological constant during these two epoches with @xmath134 correspondingly , the fractional energy density of dark energy scales as @xmath135 the @xmath21hde model corresponding to the case @xmath39 has been investigated in @xcite . in the cases with @xmath4 ,",
    "the observation constraints on the parameter @xmath46 is very weak and the models seemly have only one effective parameter , i.e. the ratio @xmath136 . in the @xmath21hde model , the parameter @xmath46 can take value in a normal order @xcite . while for the case @xmath137 , the parameter @xmath46 seems to take very large value due to the very large factor in @xmath23 , i.e.",
    "@xmath138 , in order to make the ratio @xmath139 in the right order .    in summary , @xmath1",
    "is required by the recent cosmic accelerated expansion . for @xmath1 and @xmath4 , the fraction of dark energy density scales as @xmath140 with a tiny proportionality coefficient in the early universe",
    "when @xmath95 .",
    "since the proportionality coefficient can not be determined only by the parameter @xmath46 , there are in general two model parameters .",
    "they may be chosen to be the parameter @xmath46 and the present fraction of dark energy @xmath141 . however ,",
    "if @xmath132 , the holographic type dark energy would behave almost like a cosmological constant and there seems to be only one effective parameter @xmath141 .",
    "since the total energy density @xmath142 approximately when the constituent with constant @xmath2 dominates the universe , we have @xmath143 .",
    "thus @xmath3 in the early universe .    for @xmath144",
    ", we have @xmath8 in the early universe when @xmath95 . for @xmath145",
    ", we also have @xmath146 in the matter- or radiation - dominated epoch , while @xmath147 during inflation .",
    "it is seen that for all cases @xmath6 the fraction of dark energy can be ignored naturally in early universe when @xmath95 as long as the parameter @xmath46 takes a normal order value . moreover , due to such analytic feature , we can use the approximate solution at some @xmath148 in matter - dominated epoch as the initial condition to solve the equation of motion for @xmath62 . noticing that",
    "once @xmath46 is given , the present fractional energy density @xmath149 can be obtained .",
    "so the model is a single - parameter model like the @xmath7cdm model . substituting this approximate solution to the eos of dark energy eq.([wde ] ) , we get @xmath150 in the ambient - constituent - dominated epoch . referring to eq.([wde ] ) , @xmath151 will transit to @xmath152 due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "obviously , for models with @xmath17 , the eos of the dark energy in the inflation , radiation- and matter - dominated epoch are @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 respectively , and transit to @xmath152 eventually .",
    "therefore , the eos of dark energy in such kinds of models transit from @xmath18 to @xmath19 and back to @xmath18 during the universe expansion .",
    "the choices @xmath99 are abandoned because the dark energy can not dominate the universe forever and there might be too large fraction of dark energy in early universe . while the choices @xmath10 are forbidden by the self - consistent requirement that @xmath156 when @xmath112 .",
    "we are going to mainly focus on the single - parameter models corresponding to the cases @xmath157 . in next section",
    ", we will perform the best - fit analyses on such kinds of models by using recent observations . as the @xmath21hde model",
    "@xcite corresponding to the case @xmath20 has only one effective parameter , we shall also take it into consideration for a comparison .",

    "as the cosmological observations mainly come from the epoch when the fraction of radiation energy is tiny , we then simply consider a flat friedmann - robertson - walker  ( frw ) universe containing only dark energy and matter with @xmath92 .",
    "using @xmath160 with @xmath161 the redshift , we can rewrite eq.([ode ] ) as @xmath162 and the approximate solution for the cases @xmath157 in the matter - dominated epoch is given by @xmath163 which can be chosen as an approximate solution at some @xmath164 .",
    "namely , we may take @xmath165 as the initial condition to solve the differential equation eq.([odez ] ) .",
    "the solution depends weakly on the choice of @xmath164 in a wide range , since @xmath62 is tiny and scales as @xmath166 when @xmath167 . here ,",
