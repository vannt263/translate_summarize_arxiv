    "in 1998 , goresky , kottwitz and macpherson @xcite established the gkm theory , which gives a direct link between equivariant topology and combinatorics ( or more precisely , a link between gkm manifolds and gkm graphs ) .",
    "the most essential properties of a gkm manifold @xmath5 , such as the equivariant cohomology and betti numbers of @xmath5 , can thus be explicitly expressed in terms of its corresponding gkm graph .",
    "a lot of work on this subject has been carried out since then ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , a series of papers by guillemin and zara showed that much geometrical and topological information of a gkm manifold can be read out from the corresponding gkm graph . in the gkm theory ,",
    "the action group is a torus .",
    "alternately , when the action group is chosen to be a mod 2-torus , there is an analogous theory , namely the mod 2 gkm theory ( see @xcite or @xcite ) , which has successfully been applied to find the lower bound of the number of fixed points and to study the equivariant cobordism classification and the smith problem in @xcite .",
    ".2 cm    the work of this article is mainly motivated by the gkm theory .",
    "however , we shall carry out our work in the mod 2 category .",
    "thus , let us first recall some basic facts about the mod 2 gkm theory , which inspired us to study colored regular graphs .",

    "it is well - known that @xmath12 and @xmath13\\ ] ] is a @xmath8-polynomial ring over @xmath14 , where the @xmath15 s are one - dimensional generators .",
    ".2 cm    now suppose that @xmath5 is a closed manifold with an effective @xmath10-action such that the fixed point set @xmath16 is finite , which implies @xmath17 ( see @xcite ) . then the _ borel construction _",
    "@xmath18 is defined as the orbit space of the induced diagonal action @xmath19 on @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21 so that the equivariant cohomology of @xmath5 is @xmath22 as shown in @xcite , to the @xmath10-manifold @xmath5 , one can always assign a regular graph @xmath23 with a label @xmath24 @xmath25 for each edge @xmath26 in @xmath23 .",
    "the gkm theory points out that when the @xmath10-manifold @xmath5 satisfies certain conditions , its equivariant cohomology is a free module over @xmath27 and can be explicitly read out from @xmath28 : @xmath29~|~f(v)\\equiv f(w)\\mod\\alpha(e)~\\text { for } e\\in e_v\\cap   e_w\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 denotes the vertex set of @xmath23 and @xmath31 denotes the set of all edges in @xmath23 that are adjacent to @xmath32 .",

    "let us label @xmath51 by @xmath47 and choose an orientation on @xmath51 .",
    "then one gets two _ oriented _ edges with endpoints @xmath54 and with the same `` label '' @xmath47 .",
    "since the labeled oriented edges always appear in pairs with reversing orientations , one can merge each pair into an _ unoriented _ edge , so that each @xmath51 determines one edge with two @xmath10-fixed points as its endpoints ( i.e. , a @xmath49-valent graph ) .",

    "our strategy is first to try to construct the orbit space of an action from @xmath71 .",

    "moreover , for each point @xmath424 , there is a unique nest @xmath99 such that @xmath425 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath417 admits a trivial action of @xmath10 .",
    "consider the trivial principal @xmath10-bundle @xmath426 over @xmath417 , where the bundle projection is denoted by @xmath427 , and the action of @xmath10 on @xmath205 is defined by @xmath428 as follows : @xmath429 .",
    "then we define an equivalence relation @xmath430 on @xmath205 as follows : @xmath431 if and only if        clearly @xmath5 is obtained by gluing @xmath381 copies of @xmath417 together along their boundaries . to prove that @xmath101 is indeed an @xmath3-dimensional manifold",

    "then there is a @xmath102-nest @xmath99 such that @xmath440 . since all points inside a component of @xmath441",
    "can have homeomorphic neighborhoods , we need only to prove that @xmath436 $ ] has a neighborhood homeomorphic to @xmath442 when @xmath443 is very close to a vertex .    without loss of generality",
    ", one assumes that @xmath444 is a vertex of @xmath23 .",
    "then there are @xmath7 @xmath1-nests containing @xmath32 , denoted by @xmath445 respectively .",
    "choose a local coordinate chart @xmath446 near @xmath32 in @xmath417 such that @xmath32 is mapped into the origin of @xmath442 , each @xmath447 is mapped into an @xmath1-dimensional open cone @xmath448 and @xmath449 is mapped into an @xmath3-dimensional cone @xmath450 each @xmath451 is a subgroup of rank 1 , so we can write @xmath452 .",

    "then one glues @xmath478 and @xmath479 together along their boundaries .",
