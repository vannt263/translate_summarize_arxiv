    "asteroseismology , and hence the study of stellar properties , is being revolutionized by the extremely accurate and extensive data from the corot @xcite and _ kepler _ @xcite space missions .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) , and leading to comparative asteroseismology ( or _ synasteroseismology _ ) for main - sequence stars showing solar - like oscillation @xcite .",
    "also , early analyses of _ kepler _ data have demonstrated the power of asteroseismology in characterizing the central stars in planetary systems @xcite , and such investigations will undoubtedly play a major role in the continuing _ kepler _ exploration of extra - solar planetary systems .",
    "however , perhaps the most striking results of space asteroseismology have come from the investigation of red giants . given the extensive outer convection zones of red giants , solar - like oscillations were predicted quite early @xcite .",
    "ground - based observations have been carried out in a few cases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but owing to the very long periods of these huge stars such observations are extremely demanding in terms of observing and observer s time .",
    "space observations , on the other hand , allow nearly continuous observations over very extended periods , as demonstrated by early observations by the wire @xcite and most @xcite satellites . with corot and _ kepler _ we have obtained extensive data for literally thousands of red giants , providing precise characterization of their overall characteristics , as well as , in some cases , detailed information on the properties of their deep interiors .",
    "this promises completely to change our understanding of these late phases of stellar evolution .",
    "here i provide an overview of the oscillation properties of red giants and discuss some of the initial results of the analysis of data from corot and _ kepler_. an introduction to the properties of solar - like oscillations , emphasizing the observational aspects , was provided by bedding ( this volume ) .",
    "further introductions to solar - like stellar oscillations were provided by @xcite and , in particular , by the monograph by @xcite . to illustrate the relevant properties , computations of red - giant models and oscillations are presented .",
    "these probably do not fully cover the complexities of these late stages of stellar evolution and hence are not intended as models of specific observations , but it is hoped that they at least capture the main features of these stars .",
    "the modelling was carried out using the aarhus stellar evolution code astec @xcite , with opal equation of state @xcite and opacities @xcite , and nacre @xcite nuclear reaction rates .",
    "convection was treated with the @xcite mixing - length formalism , with a mixing length proportional to the pressure scale height and approximately calibrated to a solar model .",
    "diffusion and settling were neglected and no mass loss was included .",
    "adiabatic oscillations were calculation using the aarhus adiabatic pulsation code adipls @xcite . to resolve the very rapid variations in the eigenfunctions in the stellar core ,",
    "the models were transferred from the original mesh used in the model calculation to a much finer mesh , designed to capture adequately the properties of the eigenfunctions .",
    "however , it is probably fair to say that the mesh distribution , and more generally the numerical procedures to deal with this type of oscillation , requires further optimization and testing .",
    "this section provide a brief background on the theory of stellar oscillations , as far as the oscillation frequencies and their relation to stellar properties are concerned .",
    "some emphasis is given to the oscillation properties of red giants .",
    "to understand the properties of stellar oscillation frequencies , it is a good approximation to assume that the oscillations are adiabatic , and hence ignore the processes that damp or excite the modes .",
    "this approximation breaks down in the near - surface layers , where there are strong departures from adiabaticity . also , the modelling of this region is highly uncertain , owing to the detailed effects of convection on the mean structure of the star and the dynamics of the oscillations .",
    "these near - surface processes have a significant effect on the frequencies , as is evident in the analysis of solar observations , and they must be taken into account in detailed asteroseismic analyses of solar - like oscillation frequencies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , for the present discussion we can ignore them .    with this approximation",
    "the problem of computing stellar oscillation frequencies for a given stellar model is relatively straightforward .",
    "this feature , together with the ability to determine the observed frequencies with very high accuracy , makes stellar oscillations such excellent diagnostics of the stellar interior .",
    "for the purpose of computing adiabatic frequencies , and assuming that the equilibrium model satisfies hydrostatic equilibrium ( see kawaler , this volume ) , the structure of the star is characterized by the density @xmath0 as a function of distance @xmath1 to the centre , as well as the adiabatic exponent @xmath2 , where @xmath3 where @xmath4 is pressure and the derivative corresponds to an adiabatic change . given @xmath0 the mass distribution in the star can immediately be determined , and @xmath5 can then be computed from the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , with a suitable boundary condition .",
    "this essentially defines all that is needed to complete the equations of adiabatic oscillation . for the predominantly acoustic solar - like oscillations the most important quantity is the adiabatic sound speed @xmath6 , given by @xmath7 in many relevant cases , the equation of state can be approximated by the ideal gas law : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is temperature , @xmath10 the mean molecular weight , @xmath11 boltzmann s constant and @xmath12 the atomic mass unit .",
    "we then obtain @xmath13    we consider small - amplitude oscillations in a slowly rotating star .",

    "the star has a set of eigenfrequencies @xmath23 labelled by the radial order @xmath24 . for adiabatic oscillations",
    "@xmath23 is real ; the oscillation depends on time @xmath25 and @xmath15 as @xmath26 , i.e. , for @xmath27 , as a running wave in longitude . for a nonrotating star",

    "it follows that the squared sound speed @xmath114 scales as @xmath115 and the squared characteristic frequencies scale as @xmath116 .",
    "this motivates introducing the dimensionless scaled frequencies by @xmath117 as well as @xmath118 .",

    "it follows that homologous models have the same dimensionless frequencies @xmath122 , and that the actual frequencies satisfy the scaling @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the mean density of the star .",
    "the same scaling obviously applies , e.g. , to the large frequency separation @xmath90 .",
    "actual stellar models are never strictly homologous , and in particular the changing structure of the core as nuclear burning proceeds gives strong departures from these scalings . on the other hand",

    "the increase in the depth of the outer convection zone , where @xmath127 , is evident . also , @xmath41 increases strongly in the core .",
    "this is mainly the result of the increase in the gravitational acceleration ( cf .",

    "thus model 3 has a helium core with a mass of @xmath128 , contained within the inner 0.7 % of the stellar radius . in this model",
    "the convective envelope is so deep that it extends into a region where the composition has been changed by hydrogen fusion .",
    "this causes a discontinuity in the composition and hence the density , giving rise to a spike in the buoyancy frequency , as shown in the figure .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : charfr2 ] are also indicated the dimensionless values @xmath129 of the acoustic cut - off frequency in the atmospheres of the three models . since this is determined by the atmospheric properties of the star it does not follow the homologous frequency scaling .",

    "( [ eq : tass ] ) , provides a measure of the number of acoustic modes that are trapped .",
    "this obviously decreases as the star evolves up the red - giant branch .",
    "figure  [ fig : charfr2 ] also shows that in models 2 and 3 the maximum of @xmath126 in the core is substantially higher than @xmath129 .",
    "this means that _ all _ trapped nonradial modes satisfy @xmath133 in the core and hence behave like g modes there , while they may behave as acoustic modes in the outer parts of the star where @xmath134 .",
    "the overall character of the mode then depends on whether it has the largest amplitude in the g - mode or the p - mode region , and hence , effectively , on the behaviour in the intermediate region .",

    "on the other hand , helium burning causes a convective core where the g modes are excluded ; since the behaviour of @xmath41 in the rest of the core is quite similar to that of model  1 , the effect is to decrease the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : perspac1 ] ) and hence to increase @xmath233 .",
    "this is the dominant cause of the remarkable difference in the period spacing between stars on the red - giant branch and in the red clump observed by @xcite and discussed further by bedding in this volume .",
    "the subsequent jump in @xmath233 and @xmath87 is caused by a jump in the size of the convective core , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bv25 ] by model  3 , probably associated with changes in the composition profile in the core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this analysis provides a simple explanation for the behaviour found by @xcite and furthermore indicates how this may allow the period spacing to be used as a sensitive diagnostics of the buoyancy frequency in the stellar core .",
    "further investigations will be required to obtain a deeper understanding of the diagnostic power of such data , including the ability to probe effects of convective overshoot and rotationally induced mixing in the core .",
