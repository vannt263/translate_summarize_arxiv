    "the concept of measurement has been a longstanding problem in quantum mechanics .",
    "it was discussed by von neumann  @xcite in the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics and further developed by kraus  @xcite , davies and lewis  @xcite , ozawa  @xcite , and other people ( e. g. , see  @xcite ) . according to the extended born rule , the positive operator valued measure ( povm ) @xmath0 gives the probability distribution @xmath1 $ ] in quantum measurement with @xmath2 being the density operator corresponding to a prepared state .",
    "measurement changes the quantum state as a positive map from a density operator @xmath3 to another density operator @xmath4 because of the probabilistic interpretation .",
    "the map @xmath5 is called a completely positive map ( cp map ) if the map remains positive when the map is trivially extended to any larger hilbert space .",
    "that is , @xmath6 for any state @xmath7 of an arbitrarily extended system when the map @xmath5 is completely positive .",
    "physically , this is a very reasonable requirement because there should always exist the outside of an experimental set up which is inactive during the experiment procedures  @xcite .",
    "it is known that the seemingly humble requirement of the complete positivity of the quantum operation @xmath5 together with the trace preservation and the positive convexity for the density operator @xmath2 implies an explicit representation of the physical operation in the kraus form : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is called the kraus operator and @xmath10 is the povm , with the property of the decomposition of unity , @xmath11 .",
    "the kraus representation of physical operations is a powerful tool in quantum information theory  @xcite .",
    "however , the probability distribution is not the only thing that is experimentally accessible in quantum mechanics . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the phase is also an essential ingredient and in particular the geometric phase is a notable example of an experimentally accessible quantity  @xcite .",
    "the general experimentally accessible quantity which contains complete information of the probability and the phase seems to be the _ weak value _ advocated by aharonov and his collaborators  @xcite .",
    "they proposed a model of weakly coupled system and probe ( see sec .",
    "[ wmr ] . ) to obtain information to a physical quantity as a  weak value \" only slightly disturbing the state . here",
    ", we briefly review the formal aspects of the weak value .    _ weak value _ : for an observable @xmath12 , the weak value @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are normalized pre - selected ket and post - selected bra state vectors , respectively . here , @xmath17 is an evolution operator from the time @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "the weak value @xmath13 actually depends on the pre- and post - selected states @xmath15 and @xmath16 but we omit them for notational simplicity in the case that we fix them .",
    "otherwise , we write them explicitly as @xmath20 instead for @xmath13 . the denominator is assumed to be non - vanishing .",
    "note also that the weak value @xmath13 is independent of the phases of the pre- and post - selected states so that it is defined in the ray space .",
    "the physical intuition may be enhanced by looking at the identity for the expectation value of an observable @xmath12 ,    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the probability to obtain the final state @xmath16 given the initial state @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "comparing with the standard probability theory , one may interpret the weak value as a complex random variable with the probability measure @xmath23   is given as a probabilistic average , @xmath24 , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 being the random variable associated with @xmath12 and probability measure , which is independent of @xmath12 .",
    "the standard expression of the expectation value , @xmath27 , is given by the born rule .",
    "however , this does not fit the standard probability theory because the probability measure depends on @xmath12 . ] .",
    "the statistical average of the weak value coincides with the expectation value in quantum mechanics .",
    "further , if an operator @xmath12 is a projection operator @xmath28 , the above identity becomes an analog of the bayesian formula , @xmath29 the left hand side is the probability to obtain the state @xmath30 given the initial state @xmath15 . from this",
    ", one may get some intuition by interpreting the weak value @xmath31 as the ( complex ! ) conditional probability of obtaining the result @xmath30 under an initial condition @xmath15 and a final condition @xmath32 in the process @xmath33  .",
    "we believe that the concept of a quantum trajectory can be formulated in the framework of weak values  @xcite .",
    "this interpretation of the weak values gives many possible examples of strange phenomena like a negative kinetic energy  @xcite , a spin @xmath34 for an electron  @xcite and a superluminal propagation of light  @xcite .",
    "of course , we should not take the strange weak values too literally but the remarkable consistency of the framework of the weak values due to eq .",
    "( [ bay ] ) and a consequence of the completeness relation , @xmath35 may give a useful concept to further push theoretical consideration by intuition .",
    "the framework of weak values has been theoretically applied to quantum stochastic process  @xcite , the tunneling traverse time  @xcite , non - locality and consistent history  @xcite , semi classical weak values  @xcite , counterfactual reasonings  @xcite , and quantum communications  @xcite .",
    "however , the most important fact is that the weak value is experimentally accessible by the weak measurement ( e. g. , see @xcite ) so that the intuitive argument based on the weak values can be either verified or falsified by experiments .",
    "historically , the terminology  weak value \" comes from the weak measurement , where the coupling between the target system and the probe is weak , explained in sec .",
    "below , we introduce a formal concept of a w operator as a tool to formally describe the weak value .",
    "_ w operator _ : we define a _ w operator _ @xmath36 as @xmath37 to facilitate the formal development of the weak value , we introduce the ket state @xmath38 and the bra state @xmath39 as @xmath40 so that the expression for the w operator simplifies to @xmath41 by construction , the two states @xmath38 and @xmath39 satisfy the schrdinger equations with the same hamiltonian with the initial and final conditions @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in a sense , @xmath38 evolves forward in time while @xmath39 evolves backward in time .",
    "the time reverse of the w operator ( [ tanweak ] ) is @xmath44 .",
    "thus , we can say the w operator is based on the two - state vector formalism  @xcite . historically speaking",
    ", the two - state vector formalism was originally motivated by the time symmetric description of quantum measurement  @xcite and has been related to the weak values and weak measurement  @xcite also developed by aharonov _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "even an apparently similar quantity to the w operator ( [ tanweak ] ) was introduced by reznik and aharonov  @xcite in the name of  two - state \" with the conceptually different meaning .",
    "the w operator gives the weak value of the observable @xmath12 as @xmath45 in parallel with the expectation value of the observable @xmath12 by @xmath46 from born s probabilistic interpretation .",
    "furthermore , the w operator ( [ definition ] ) can be regarded as a special case of a standard purification of the density operator  @xcite . in our opinion ,",
    "the w operator should be considered on the same footing of the density operator . for a closed system ,",
    "both satisfy the schrdinger equation . in a sense",
    ", the w operator @xmath47 is the square root of the density operator since @xmath48 which describes a state evolving forward in time for a given initial state @xmath49 , while @xmath50 which describes a state evolving backward in time for a given final state @xmath51 .",
    "the w operator describes the entire history of the state from the past ( @xmath52 ) to the future ( @xmath53 ) and measurement performed at the time @xmath54 as we shall see in sec .",
    "this description is conceptually different from the conventional one by the time evolution of the density operator .",
    "our aim is to find the most general map for the w operator @xmath47 .",
    "the result turns out to be of the form @xmath55  .",
    "the w operator is a useful tool to compactly describe the effect of decoherence to the weak values just as the density operator is to the expectation value in the standard theory of decoherence  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the amount of the effect due to the environment in the weak measurement is exactly given by the weak value defined by the quantum operation of the w operator @xmath56 .",

    "[ qofqs ] , we recapitulate the cp map as quantum operations for density operators .",
    "we define a w operator motivated by the two - state vector formalism and construct quantum operations for the w operator instead of the density operator . because of the complete positivity of the quantum operation , we can construct the state change defined by operations solely on the target hilbert space similarly to the kraus representation . in sec .",

    "we analyze the target system with the noise during the weak measurement by the shifts of the probe observables . in sec .",

    "since the geometric phase can be formally given by weak values  @xcite , we operationally define the geometric phase for mixed states on the basis of the quantum operation of the w operator .",

    "let us recapitulate the general theory of quantum operations of a finite dimensional quantum system  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch . 8) .",
    "all physically realizable quantum operations can be generally described by a cp map  @xcite , since the isolated system of a target system and an auxiliary system always undergoes the unitary evolution according to the axiom of quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "one of the important properties of the cp map is that all physically realizable quantum operations can be described only by operators defined in the target system .",
    "let @xmath5 be a positive map from @xmath57 , a set of linear operations on the hilbert space @xmath58 , to @xmath57 .",
    "if @xmath5 is completely positive , its trivial extension @xmath59 from @xmath57 to @xmath60 is also positive such that @xmath61 for an arbitrary state @xmath62 .",
    "we assume without loss of generality @xmath63 .",
    "throughout this paper , we concentrate on the case that the target state is pure though the generalization to mixed states is straightforward . from the complete positivity ,",
    "we obtain the following theorem for quantum state changes .    for any quantum state @xmath64 , we expand @xmath65 with a fixed complete orthonormal set @xmath66 .",

    "we define the kraus operator @xmath78  @xcite as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is defined in eq .",

    "then , the quantum state change becomes the kraus form , @xmath81 we emphasize that the quantum state change is described solely in terms of the quantities of the target system .",

    "the weak value is an analog of a probability , and so is the w operator that of the density operators .",
    "we discuss a state change in terms of the w operator and define a map @xmath85 as @xmath86 for an arbitrary @xmath87 .",
    "then , we obtain the following theorem on the change of the w operator such as theorem [ 1th ] .    for any w operator @xmath88 , we expand @xmath89 with fixed complete orthonormal sets @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",

    "[ 2th ]    the proof is completely parallel to that of theorem [ 1th ] .",
    "we take the polar decomposition of the map @xmath85 to obtain @xmath98 noting that @xmath99 the unitary operator @xmath100 is well - defined on @xmath101 because @xmath59 defined in eq .",

    "the proof is simple @xcite and goes through as @xmath114 this argument for the density operator @xmath115 applies also for @xmath116 to obtain @xmath117 because this is the density operator in the time reversed world in the two - state vector formulation as reviewed in the introduction .",
