    "the coulomb blocking of electrons entering nanostructures has been known for quite some time and is explained by the magnitude of the direct part of the repulsive coulomb interaction energy in relation to the energy spectrum of the nanosystem.@xcite the experimental and theoretical studies of coulomb effects on the mesoscopic transport were commonly focused on steady - state regime of single or double quantum dots .",
    "however , the increasing interest in fast dynamics at nanoscale and time - resolved detection of electrons via a nearby detector strongly motivates theoretical investigations of interacting time - dependent transport in complex systems .",
    "the dynamical aspects of the coulomb blocking have been investigated by kurth et al .  in a one - dimensional lattice model using combination of non - equilibrium green s functions and time dependent density - functional theory for the coulomb interaction.@xcite    in a recent work",
    "@xcite we have also analyzed the transient currents through an interacting two - dimensional quantum dot by solving the generalized master equation for the matrix elements of the reduced density operator acting in the fock space of interacting many - electrons states of the dot .",
    "the gme scheme that we implement numerically takes into account the geometrical details of the sample and leads ( see ref .  ) .",
    "our aim here is to apply the same method to more complex systems in order to single out non - trivial coulomb effects in the transient regime .",
    "the system we consider is a parabolic quantum wire with an additional ring - shaped confining potential .",
    "the embedded ring geometry imposes different localization properties of the states with respect to the regions where the leads are attached .",
    "this fact has important consequences on the time - dependent filling of the many - electron states .",
    "even though the transport and magnetic properties of quantum rings have fascinated researchers for a long time new questions and results regarding the aharonov - bohm interference oscillations have been catching attention.@xcite dynamical effects have been studied in open or closed quantum rings .",
    "propagation of electron pulses in rings of finite width has been investigated by chaves et al.@xcite and by thorgillsson et al .",
    "@xcite within scattering theory , and non - adiabatic current generation in a closed finite quantum ring in an external magnetic field has been studied by integrating the liouville - von neumann equation for the density operator in time.@xcite the system was perturbed by a strong dipole or higher order multipolar electric electric field pulse and the mutual coulomb interaction between the electrons was included in a mean - field dft manner .",
    "we use a non - markovian version of the generalized master equation@xcite and treat the coulomb interaction of the electrons exactly within a truncated many - electron basis.@xcite the gme formalism was originally proposed by nakajima and zwanzig,@xcite and has more recently been applied to study transport phenomena by several authors , @xcite just to cite few .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii sets the notations and presents briefly the formalism , section iii describes the quantum wire structure with the embedded ring , section iv contains the results and their discussion while section v is left for conclusions .",
    "in this section we recall the main outlines of the gme method leading to the numerical results .",

    "it should though be kept in mind that the structure of the equation implies higher order processes to infinite order .    in the derivation of the gme here only the coupling hamiltonian",
    "is allowed to depend on time .",
    "the possibility of the hamiltonian of the central system @xmath34 depending on time ( describing a laser pulse for example ) has been considered by amin et al.@xcite a dft description of the mutual coulomb interaction of the electrons in the central system would require @xmath34 to be time - dependent , and it would also require a further reduction of the gme introducing the reduced single - particle density matrix loosing some many - electron correlation effects caused by the coupling of the system to the leads.@xcite    our approach to solve this dilemma has been reported earlier,@xcite but here we shall briefly outline it for the case of the continuous model .",
    "we choose to change the hamiltonian of the central system @xmath35 to include the time - independent coulomb interaction term appropriate for our many - electron formalism .",

    "the diagonalization yields a new basis of interacting mes @xmath41 connected to the non - interacting one by a unitary transformation @xmath42 supplied by the diagonalization . here",
    "we need to keep in mind that @xmath43 will be represented by an @xmath44 matrix in numerical calculations .",
    "an inspection of the structure of the non - interacting gme ( [ gme ] ) reveals that the equation can be also be transformed to the interacting basis @xmath41 by the unitary transformation .",
    "thus , in a numerical calculation a basis transformation of the many - electron coupling matrix @xmath45 ( [ toperator ] ) and the insertion of the diagonalized matrix representation of the interacting @xmath46 in the gme ( [ gme ] ) will give the rdo in the interacting mes basis @xmath47 .",
    "as all measurable quantities are in the end expressed as a partial trace with respect to operators of the central system expectation values can be calculated in the new basis and for the same reason in the non - interacting case we can again obtain the mean value of the left or right current directly from the transformed gme .    in our earlier publication@xcite neglecting the coulomb interaction it was clear that we could only effectively describe the time - dependent transport through systems with up to 7 or 8 ses considered relevant for the currents , situated in and around the window of the chemical potentials of the two leads .",
    "this limitation was imposed by the complex bandstructure of the energy spectrum in the broad leads employed in the calculations . here",
    ", we may have to include more sess in order to describe reasonably the interaction of the electrons in the central system . in order to accomplish this we have to resort to a more refined truncation procedure than we used for the non - interacting system :",
    "the unitary transformation can not be truncated and has to include the @xmath48 states constructed initially from the @xmath49 sess . in the numerical calculations here",
    "we will employ 12 ses leading to 4096 mes .",
    "the unitary transformation of @xmath50 is thus cpu - time intensive for all the @xmath51-values necessary for the leads , but it has only to be performed once .",
    "after that it is possible to deploy a second truncation to the gme by keeping only the @xmath52 mes with lowest energy .",

    "only one or two elements oscillate and one of them is clearly stronger .",
    "we see thus that oscillations of the electron correlations are inherent in the gme formalism irrespective of the presence of the coulomb interaction or not .",
    "it is a part of the correlations forced on various states of the system by the coupling to the leads .",
    "here , we observe that the coulomb interaction further couples different types of states in the system . states with weak coupling to the leads residing in regions of the system away from the contact area with states with higher presence in the contact area . furthermore , the magnetic field simplifies the energy spectrum of the system such that oscillations in the correlation of a single pair of mess will be dominant and thus visible in the total current .    as was stated before the oscillations in the density caused by the oscillation in the electron correlation are minute .",

    "we have used a time - dependent transport formalism built on the generalized master equation ( gme ) where the mutual coulomb interaction between electrons is treated within the `` exact numerical diagonalization '' or `` configuration interaction '' to analyze the transport properties of a quantum two - dimensional ring or a short 2d quantum wire with an embedded ring .",
    "the quantum wire is defined by a parabolic confinement potential in the wire plane perpendicular to the transport direction .",
    "the ends of the quantum wire are hard walls that are made transparent to tunneling by a weak coupling to leads .",
    "the shape of the finite wire and the definition of the ring potential ( [ v_qr ] ) leads to a ring system with a potential that does not have a totally flat bottom , see fig .",
    "[ system ] .",
    "for this reason we have a system that has sess that are ring states for higher energy , but the lowest states can be slightly localized in different part of the system .",
    "we show that indeed , in this geometry the coulomb interaction between the electrons increases the occupation of the system by coupling states with different localization properties .",
    "the correlation of the states in the system caused by the coupling to the leads is enhanced by the coulomb interaction leading to a behavior that runs counter to the usual coulomb blockade in a simpler geometry .",
    "of course the coulomb blocking mechanism is inherent in the interacting system , but by comparing the interacting system with the noninteracting one we discover finer details in the action of the interaction , details that are usually collected under the title : correlation effects .",
    "in addition we find current oscillations that are caused by oscillating correlation properties of the electrons in the system .",
    "these oscillations become visible in higher magnetic field due to the reduction of mess active in the transport by the magnetic field . as the correlations are caused by the coupling to the leads the oscillations are visible in systems without or with coulomb interaction between the electrons , but the coulomb interaction influences them through its enhancing of correlations by coupling of electronic states .",
