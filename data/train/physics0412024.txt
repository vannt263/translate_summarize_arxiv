    "although the structure of special relativity is best explained using inertial frames , it is natural to ask how minkowski spacetime would appear to a non - inertial observer .",
    "the motion of a non - inertial observer is often studied in an inertial reference frame .",
    "however , it is more convenient to construct coordinates for the non - inertial observer and to express the metric in these coordinates . in this way",
    "the non - inertial observer does not need to communicate directly with inertial observers to interpret the results of her own experiments .",
    "two observations will guide the mathematical derivations of this work .",
    "( a ) the definition of the coordinates must be operationally clear .",
    "in ( @xmath0)-dimensions there are many possible choices , but only radar coordinates are clear operationally .",
    "other well known coordinates , such as fermi coordinates,@xcite are mathematically convenient but turn out to be difficult to interpret operationally .",
    "( b ) the motion of the non - inertial observer influences the expression of the metric in the non - inertial coordinates .",
    "it is convenient to express the motion of the non - inertial observer by means of her proper acceleration because this quantity is directly observable and makes no reference to external inertial frames .",
    "following this strategy the non - inertial observer metric is expected to depend on the proper acceleration history of the non - inertial observer .",
    "we shall be particularly concerned with what can be actually measured by the non - inertial observer , and our construction will depend on an observable definition of the coordinates ( radar coordinates ) and on an observable and intrinsic description of the non - inertial observer motion ( the proper acceleration ) .",
    "we consider a non - inertial observer @xmath1 in unidirectional , but otherwise arbitrary , motion in the minkowski two - dimensional spacetime of metric signature @xmath2 .",
    "the minkowski metric is given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are coordinates of an inertial frame @xmath6 and where units have been chosen such that @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 be the arbitrary timelike worldline of the non - inertial observer , @xmath9 the proper time parametrization , and @xmath10 with @xmath11 the covariant velocity .    as mentioned , the non - inertial observer can construct coordinates using different methods .",
    "the transformation between inertial and non - inertial coordinates should reduce to a lorentz transformation if the observer has vanishing acceleration . however , this requirement is too weak to determine a unique solution .",
    "there are at least three possibilities that have been considered : radar coordinates,@xcite fermi coordinates@xcite and mller coordinates.@xcite    even more possibilities arise if the observer is not regarded as isolated , but as part of an extended reference frame@xcite where no worldline has a privileged role.@xcite in this case the coordinate system also would depend on the rigidity assumptions that constrain the frame.@xcite    here we shall focus on radar coordinates .",
    "they are commonly used in the study of accelerating@xcite and rotating systems in special relativity.@xcite these coordinates are not related to measurements performed with standard rods and clocks .",
    "they are just convenient labels of spacetime events . however , in the neighborhood of the observer worldline , because they approximate the coordinates of a comoving inertial frame , they represent measurements performed by rods and clocks .",
    "for example , the radar distance becomes the distance that would be measured using standard rods.@xcite",
    "radar coordinates are defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath12 be a spacetime event and consider the light beam @xmath13 emitted at @xmath12 .",
    "it reaches @xmath1 s worldline at the proper time @xmath14 .",
    "consider also the light beam @xmath15 that was emitted at a suitable proper time @xmath16 and reaches @xmath12 . by using the radar procedure , the observer @xmath1 assigns to @xmath12 a time label given by @xmath17 .",
    "note that if @xmath18 , then the time label assigned to @xmath12 is just @xmath9 .",
    "for this reason the time label will be denoted by the same symbol @xmath19 next @xmath1 assigns to the event a radar distance given by @xmath20 it is more convenient to define a spatial coordinate @xmath21 rather than a distance , and we define @xmath22 with the plus sign if @xmath12 stays to the right of the curve @xmath8 or the minus sign if @xmath12 stays to the left .",
    "[ radar2 ]   and @xmath23.,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]    it also is convenient to introduce the quantities @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "[ radar2 ] ) .",
    "these quantities coincide respectively with @xmath26 and @xmath27 if @xmath12 stays to the right of the curve @xmath8 , and in the opposite case , they coincide respectively with @xmath27 and @xmath26 .",
    "we can say that @xmath28 determines the intersection event between @xmath29 and a light beam moving from the right to the left , and @xmath23 determines the intersection event between @xmath29 and a light beam moving from the left to the right . with these definitions we have",
    "the radar coordinates @xmath30 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are directly observable quantities .",
    "the radar coordinates are defined in the intersection between the causal future and the causal past of the curve @xmath29 . outside this region , @xmath31 , or @xmath32 , or both ,",
    "are not defined .",
    "a typical example is the constant acceleration case .",
    "only the events in the rindler wedge , @xmath33 , admit two light beams passing through them that intersect the curve @xmath29 , thus defining @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "if we introduce the coordinates @xmath34 , then the minkowski metric takes the form @xmath35 note that the events with a given value of @xmath36 lie in a plane of equation @xmath37 this fact will be central in what follows and justifies the introduction of @xmath28 and @xmath23 in place of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "finally , we introduce the acceleration of the non - inertial observer given by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the levi - civita connection of the minkowski metric @xmath40 , that is , if @xmath41 is a vector field , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 are the christoffel coefficients . in inertial",

    ", @xmath54 is the apparent acceleration of free particles with respect to the accelerated observer .",
    "our goal is to prove the the following result : in the radar coordinates @xmath55 , the minkowski metric takes the form @xmath56 this result generalizes to arbitrary motion the constant acceleration case considered by lass@xcite for which he finds , given certain assumptions , that @xmath57 the fact that the coordinates @xmath9 and @xmath21 are radar coordinates of the uniformly accelerated observer was pointed out later.@xcite the constant acceleration case is also discussed in refs .  .",
    "it is remarkable that the problem can be solved without restricting assumptions .",
    "note that at time @xmath9 the non - inertial observer knows the spacetime coordinates @xmath58 of the events in the causal past of @xmath8 . at the same time",
    "the observer can immediately calculate the metric in its causal past from the knowledge of the acceleration @xmath48 as measured by a comoving accelerometer .",
    "it also is interesting that the metric at the event @xmath12 is determined by the acceleration of the observer in events that are spacelike separated from @xmath12 .",
    "indeed , the integral that appears in eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) is between @xmath25 and @xmath24 . from eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) we see that the radar coordinates are conformally related with the inertial coordinates .",
    "thus the speed of light in radar coordinates is equal to one in both directions,@xcite indeed @xmath59 implies @xmath60 .",
    "the proof of goes as follows . because the level set of the function @xmath36 coincides with that of the function @xmath61 , there exist functions @xmath62 and @xmath63 such that    [ 8 ] @xmath64    we therefore have    @xmath65    the worldline @xmath29 satisfies @xmath66 , and along this worldline , @xmath67 and @xmath68 ; thus @xmath69 .",

    "( [ oh ] ) , we obtain eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) .    the coordinate transformation between @xmath58 and @xmath93 can be found from eqs .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) @xmath94 where @xmath95 and and @xmath96 are the velocity and position of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath6 at @xmath97 .",
    "for @xmath98 this transformation becomes a poincar transformation between an inertial frame moving at speed @xmath95 and @xmath6 .",
    "it is interesting to compare these results with the analogous results obtained for the fermi coordinates .",
    "the accelerated observer sets up fermi coordinates @xmath99 if two conditions are fulfilled : ( 1 ) the simultaneity slices , @xmath100 , are lines perpendicular to the observer worldline , and ( 2 ) given the event @xmath12 , @xmath101 is , up to a sign , the length of the geodesic segment that lies in the simultaneity slice and that connects @xmath12 with the observer s worldline . in the @xmath0 case ,",

    "an important consequence of this result is that up to worldline reparametrizations , there is a one - to - one correspondence between oriented conformally flat coordinate systems in @xmath0 minkowski spacetime and observers ( timelike worldlines ) .",
