    "one of the most interesting features discovered by _ chandra _ satellite observations of galaxy clusters are the sharp x - ray surface brightness discontinuities , accompanied by jumps in gas temperature named `` cold fronts '' ( e.g. markevitch et al . 2000 ; vikhlinin et al . 2001 ; mazzotta et al .",
    "the temperature and density jumps happen in such a way as to maintain the gas pressure continuously across the front and , therefore , they are not created by shocks .",
    "they were originally interpreted as being the result of subsonic ( transonic ) motions of head - on merging substructures with suppressed thermal conduction ( markevitch et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ; vikhlinin et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the above mentioned merger core remnant model is theoretically justified ( e.g. bialek , evrard & mohr 2002 ; nagai & kravtsov 2003 ; heinz et al .",
    "2003 ; mathis , et al . 2005 ; poole et al . 2006 ) and holds relatively well for clusters that have clear signs of merging , such as 1e0657 - 56 ( markevitch et al . 2002 ) and a3667 ( vikhlinin et al . 2001 ) . however , these models do not work well for the increasing number of cold fronts ( sometimes multiple cold fronts in the same cluster ) found in apparently non - merging clusters such as a496 ( dupke & white 2003 , hereafter dw03 ) , a1795 ( markevitch et al . 2001 ) , rxj1720.1 + 2638 ( mazzotta et al .",
    "this prompted the development of other models for cold front generation , such as oscillation of the cd and the low entropy gas around the bottom of the potential well ( lufkin et al .",
    "1995 ; fabian et al . 2001 ; dw03 ) , hydrodynamic gas sloshing ( ascasibar & markevitch 2006 , hereafter am06 ) , or dark matter peak oscillation due to scattering of a smaller dark matter system ( tittley & henriksen 2005 ) .",
    "for very recent review see markevitch & vikhlinin ( 2007 ) .",
    "cold fronts are found with relatively high frequency .",
    "a review of archival images finds that more than 40% of the observed clusters have cold front - like features and their presence may have significant physical impact in the physics of their host cluster cores , such as gas heating , generation of bulk and turbulent velocities , constraining conduction , etc .",
    "the significance of cold fronts influence on cluster physics depends on how they are being generated .",
    "therefore , it is important to determine which mechanisms actually produce cold fronts .",
    "abell 496 provides an excellent opportunity to test different scenarios for cold front generation given its physical and observational characteristics .",
    "a496 is a typical , bright , nearby ( z@xmath20.032 ) , apparently relaxed cold core cluster .",
    "the x - ray peak coincides very well with the cd optical centroid .",
    "the gas temperature varies from 56 kev in the outer regions to 23 kev in the central arcmin ( e.g. tamura et al .",
    "2001 , dw03 ) .",
    "the presence of a central abundance enhancement has been established with previous instruments including _ ginga _ and _ einstein _ ( white et al .  1994 ) , _ asca _ ( e.g. dupke & white 2000a ) , _ bepposax _ ( irwin & bregman 2001 ) and _ xmm _ ( tamura et al 2001 ) , showing an overall radial enhancement from @xmath10.2 - 0.25 solar in the outer regions to @xmath1 0.4 - 0.7 solar in the central arcmin .",
    "furthermore , dupke & white ( 2000a ) also discovered radial gradients , for the first time , in various elemental abundance @xmath3 , which indicates that the gas in the central 2 - 3@xmath4 has a higher proportion of sn ia ejecta ( @xmath170% ) than the outer parts of the cluster .",
    "this was confirmed by more sensitive spectrometers on - board _ xmm _ ( tamura et al 2001 ) .",
    "as pointed out by dw03 , different models for cold front formation can be discriminated through the analysis of chemical gradients across the front .",
    "if the cold front is a due to a head - on merger core remnant , we should expect the front to be accompanied by a specific discontinuity of elemental abundance ratios ( e.g. mushotzky et al .",
    "1996 ; dupke & white 2000a , b ) . the expected discontinuity in this case would be symmetric with respect to the merger axis and asymmetric with respect to the perpendicular direction to the merger axis .",
    "this kind of analysis can be performed best with _",
    ", given its high angular resolution .",
    "dw03 performed a chemical analysis of the cold front in abell 496 . with an effective exposure of @xmath19 ksec",
    ", they were able to determine abundance ratio profiles only on large semi - annuli , covering a region larger than that of the cold front itself .",
    "the distribution of iron , silicon and oxygen abundances showed radial gradients but there were no clear discontinuities uniquely related to the cold front itself , pointing out the weaknesses of the remnant merging core model when applied to a496 . here",
    "we report the results of a deeper observation of that cluster that allowed us to produce high quality maps of the gas parameters and to compare more closely the observations with the predictions given by different models for cold front formation .",
    "all distances shown in this _",
    "letter _ are calculated assuming a h@xmath5 km  s@xmath6mpc@xmath6 and @xmath7 unless stated otherwise . at the distance of this cluster @xmath8 0.66 kpc .",
    "abell 496 was observed by _",
    "acis - s3 in july 2004 for 76 ksec .",
    "the cluster was centered on the s3 chip .",
    "we used ciao 3.2.0 with caldb 3.0 to screen the data . after correcting for a short flare - like period",
    "the resulting exposure time in our analysis was 59.6 ksec .",
    "a gain map correction was applied together with pha and pixel randomization .",
    "acis particle background was cleaned as prescribed for vfaint mode .",
    "point sources were extracted and the background used in spectral fits was generated from blank - sky observations using the acis_bkgrnd_lookup script .",
    "here we show the results of spectral fittings with xspec v11.3.1 ( arnaud 1996 ) using the apec and vapec thermal emission models .",
    "metal abundances are measured relative to the solar photospheric values of anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "galactic photoelectric absorption was incorporated using the wabs model ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) .",
    "spectral channels were grouped to have at least 20 counts / channel .",
    "energy ranges were restricted to 0.59.5 kev .",
    "the spectral fitting errors are 1-@xmath9 confidence unless stated otherwise .    in order to obtain an overall distribution of the spectral parameters we used an adaptive smoothing code that selects extraction regions based on a fixed minimum number of counts per cell ( here we used 3000 counts for temperatures and global abundances and 7000 for individual abundances ) to maintain the range of statistical fitting errors more or less constant throughout .",
    "the intercell spacing is fixed at a fraction of the radius of the surrounding cells and in general there is significant cell to cell overlap except for the cells with smallest size .",
    "the overlap of extraction regions is therefore stronger in low surface brightness regions , away from the core of the cluster .",
    "we plot the distribution of region sizes in figures 3e and 4e , to give an estimate of the local smoothing kernel size .",
    "the code produces a matrix with best - fit values and different cell sizes .",
    "the best - fit values used here are defined as the mid point of the 68% confidence errors . in order to make the contour plots ,",
    "this matrix is mapped into a square matrix with equal cell sizes using an interpolation routine .",
    "this is done by computing a new value for each cell in the regular matrix weighing by the values of the adjoining cells in the matrix included within some defined search radius ( minimum of 3 cells in 4 adjacent quadrants ) .",
    "the closest measured values usually have the most influence on calculating the value of a cell .",
    "the computation is based on the kriging method ( for a description see , e. g. , davis , 1986 , p.383 ) , which calculates the weights from a semivariogram ( @xmath10 ) developed from the spatial structure of the data , where @xmath11 is the number of intervals between the values of the regionalized variable @xmath12 taken at location @xmath13 and @xmath14 and @xmath15 is te total number of points .",
    "the number of cells of the mapped matrix was artificially increased to three times of the maximum length of the original matrix for purposes of improving image quality for analysis .",
    "this is responsible for the small `` square domains '' that appear in figures 3a , c & 4a , c .",
    "the values outside the ccd border contours are also an effect of the smoothing algorithm and should be ignored .",
    "figure 1a shows the exposure corrected smoothed x - ray image of a496 .",
    "one can clearly see the sharp surface brightness edge towards the north , described in dw03 .",
    "one can also see two other brightness edges ( to the sw and se ) that meet at nearly right angles .",
    "this suggests the presence of multiple cold fronts in this cluster to the south , out of the field of view of our observation ] . to analyze the nature of these edges we used the set of extraction regions shown in figure 1b .",
    "the results are shown in figures 2a , b using a wabs apec spectral model .",
    "figure 2a shows the distribution of surface brightness ( top ) and projected gas temperatures using the bins shown in figure 1b ( bottom ) .",
    "the color association between the figures 2 and figure 1b is : north  black , east  red , south  blue and west  green .",
    "the locations of the cold fronts are marked by vertical dashed lines and follow the same color code .",
    "there are at least three ( up to five ) surface brightness edges accompanied by sudden temperature jumps , consistent with cold fronts ; the northern one is at @xmath1 73 kpc and is the strongest .",
    "the western cold front is nearly at the same radial distance ( r @xmath1 64 kpc ) as the northern one and is , apparently , an extension of the northern front .",
    "we can also see that the two edges near the core , labeled east ( r @xmath1 16 kpc ) and south ( r @xmath1 22 kpc ) have the temperature jumps characteristic of cold fronts .",
    "there is also a marginally significant cold front to the east at r @xmath1 106 kpc .    following dw03 , we measured the radial distribution of metal abundance ratios towards the directions of the main fronts ( edges ) .",
    "we used `` pie '' extraction regions that were chosen in such a way as to have the same opening angle as the cold front of interest . in the radial distributions",
    "there are no clear significant systematic relations between the changes in fe abundance or abundance ratios and cold fronts .",
    "the changes seen can be mostly associated with overall ( global ) radial trends .",
    "globally , the fe abundance shows a radial decline from supersolar near the cluster s center to subsolar in the outer core regions . at the very center , r@xmath1610@xmath17 ( @xmath1  7 kpc )",
    ", there is a significant abundance dip described in the next section .",
    "the radially average values in the central 23 kpc is 0.93@xmath00.04 solar ( with asymmetric variations from 0.8 solar to 1.2 solar ) and in the outer ( 130@xmath050 ) kpc is 0.75@xmath00.04 ( with asymmetric variations from 0.47 solar to 0.86 solar ) .",
    "the results for the ratios involving si , s , and fe are shown in figure 2b , where the color code is the same as that used in figure 2a . in the abundance ratio plots we added `` 2 '' to the values of the northern and western directions , for illustration purposes . despite the strong anisotropies , particularly in the bins within @xmath170110 kpc",
    ", there is also a tendency for the @xmath18element ratios to fe grow radially .",
    "the si / fe abundance ratio is consistent with a flat ( or mildly increasing ) profiles going from 1.39@xmath00.10 in the central @xmath111 kpc to 1.52@xmath00.23 in the very outer core regions ( @xmath19 110 kpc ) . in the same regions , the s",
    "/ fe ratio exhibits a more significant gradient , growing from @xmath1 1.46@xmath00.14 solar to 2.34@xmath00.38 solar .",
    "the error weighted average of the sn type dominance of the fe mass from the two ratios above corresponds to 65%@xmath04% sn ia fe mass fraction for the central region and 57%@xmath07% in the outer regions .",
    "this is consistent with the general trend found with _",
    "asca _ by dupke & white ( 2001a ) for larger spatial scales ( up to @xmath16 500 kpc , although the absolute values of the sulfur abundance are higher than those determined with _ asca _ ( dupke & white 2000a ) and _ xmm _ ( tamura et al .",
    "the variations in the radial distributions of abundance ratios and temperatures suggest the presence of significant asymmetries . to explore the nature of these asymmetries we produced 2dimensional adaptively smoothed maps of projected gas temperatures , abundances and abundance ratios .",
    "we discuss them in the next section .      given the level of asymmetry of the distributions of gas temperature , metal abundances and abundance ratios , it is helpful to analyze the 2-d distributions of these parameters . the temperature and fe abundance maps are shown in figures 3a , c , with x - ray surface brightness contours used in figure 1b overlaid . the steepest temperature gradient is seen to the north .",
    "one striking feature that can be seen in the temperature map is a `` cold spiral arm '' that departs from the core to the n - nw up to the cold front position and runs along the cold front to the e - ne becoming more diffuse as it turns towards the s. the smoothing kernel radius map ( figure 3e ) shows a value of @xmath120(30 ) pix or 10@xmath17(15@xmath17 ) in the inner ( outer ) arm regions , which is nearly half of the arm thickness and indicates that the arm is well spatially resolved . guided by the temperature map , we defined regions that characterize the inner and outer parts of the arm for spectral extraction and they are shown in figures 3a , c & 4a , c , and the relevant best fit parameters are shown in table 1 .",
    "the temperature of the cold arm is @xmath13.08@xmath00.07 kev .",
    "the temperatures on the surrounding regions of the cold arm are 3.5@xmath00.11 kev and 4.7@xmath00.22 kev towards the inner and outer cluster regions , respectively .",
    "the cold arm is definitely associated with the northern cold front and to a lesser extent to the western cold front .",
    "it departs from a boxy low temperature region , the edges of which appear coincide with the southeastern and southern cold fronts near the cluster s core , although the temperature edges in these weaker cold fronts are less well - defined than that of the main cold front . from figure 3b it can be seen that the overall temperature error in the cold arm region is around 0.10.2 kev .",
    "the higher temperatures near the southern ccd border are not well constrained ( with errors @xmath19 1 kev ) .",
    "there are significant indications of a `` cold tail '' ( t @xmath1 4 kev ) starting 2@xmath4.3 southwest of the cluster s center extending to 4@xmath4.2 to the south of the cluster that is associated with a low fe abundance region ( figure 3c ) .",
    "the abundance along the cold tail is approximately half of the surrounding regions values of @xmath11.2 solar .",
    "this `` cold tail '' seems to extend to the south for more 5@xmath4 ( tanaka et al .",
    "a similar cold tail was found on the opposite side of the cold front in the cluster 2a0335 + 096 ( tanaka et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the fe abundance map is also inhomogeneous ( figures 3c , d ) .",
    "there is an overall abundance gradient , which is steeper towards the northern regions .",
    "in particular the transition from sub to super solar abundances happens at a radius of 100@xmath17140@xmath17 from the center in all directions but the south . in general , the fe abundance within the main cold front spatial scales ( r@xmath2060 kpc ) is supersolar , with the exception of the very central 8 kpc , where an abundance `` dip '' is found .",
    "the fe abundance in the central dip reaches a minimum of 0.55@xmath00.3 solar ( an average 0.8@xmath00.03 solar in a circular region 10.5 kpc in radius ) and in the immediately surrounding regions achieves a maximum of @xmath11.7@xmath00.4 solar ( an average of 1.1@xmath00.04 solar within an annulus with radius between 11 kpc and 22 kpc ) .",
    "there is a secondary , marginally significant , abundance dip with similar spatial scales 35@xmath17 to the n - nw , where the abundance decreases from @xmath11.3 to @xmath10.7 solar with a characteristic error of 0.3 solar .",
    "central metal abundance dips have been found in other clusters ( e.g. , a2199 ( johnstone et al . 2002 ) , centaurus ( sanders & fabian 2002 ) and perseus ( schmidt et al . 2002 ) ) , and the mechanisms that generate them are a matter of current debate . suggested",
    "scenarios include resonant scattering ( cf . sanders & fabian 2006 ) , extremely inhomogeneous metal abundances ( morris & fabian 2003 ) , artifacts appearing from fitting single temperature models to multi temperature gas ( buote 2000 ) and buoyant transport to higher radii ( brighenti & mathews 2005 ) .",
    "none of these mechanisms are adequate to explain off - center abundance dips , which are probably related to previous agn activity .",
    "a extended analysis of off - center abundance dips in clusters is provided elsewhere ( dupke , nyland & bregman 2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "metal abundances are in general high towards the southern regions , with the exception of the regions coincident with the southern cold tail .",
    "we performed an analysis of the 2-d distribution of the elemental abundance ratios in this cluster .",
    "different metal enrichment mechanisms act with different efficiencies at different cluster locations and produce different sn type ejecta signatures . therefore , elemental abundance",
    "_ ratios _ can be used as `` fingerprints '' used to trace the gas history , better than metal abundances alone .",
    "the abundance ratio maps involving the best determined abundances ( si , s , and fe ) are shown in figures 4a , c. the 1-@xmath9 errors of the quantities are shown in figures 4b , d , and give an idea of the significance level of the measured quantity in the region of interest .",
    "since our best - fit values are defined as the mid - point of the 1-@xmath9 error bars , we use only values with fractional errors smaller than 100% were used to create the 2-d square images .",
    "this is done to avoid biases in the interpolation to produce the smoothed color contours that would be caused by upper / lower limits , where the error bars can be highly asymmetrical .",
    "it can be seen that , in general , the cold arm is accompanied by enhanced abundance ratio values ( lower sn ia fe mass fraction than the surroundings ) , which is visible in the si / fe , which shows an average variation from @xmath11 to 2 , or equivalently , from 85% to 51% sn ia",
    "fe mass fraction , respectively in the regions surrounding the cold arm and the regions along the cold arm .",
    "the characteristic error is @xmath10.4 ( @xmath114% in sn ia fe mass fraction ) and the characteristic smoothing kernel size is @xmath130 ( 50 ) pixels , or 15@xmath17(25@xmath17 ) .",
    "sulfur abundances are higher than expected and abundance ratios are off - scale when compared to the theoretical predictions of nomoto et al",
    ". 1997a , b for sn ia and ii yields",
    ". however , the trend of s / fe is similar to that of si / fe and to place the limits within theoretical bounds , we need to apply constant positive correction of @xmath10.4 to s / fe , placing the and the corresponding s negative correction @xmath1 0.40.8 within the errors ( see footnote 2 ) .",
    "the analysis of the core of a496 presented in this _ letter",
    "_ reveals several new features that were not observed previously .",
    "a large multiplicity of cold - front features ( at least three cold fronts ) ; a spiral cold arm seen in the temperature map , which is clearly associated with the main ( northern ) cold front ; strong indication of spiral ( or circular ) chemical arms associated with the main cold front ; a cold , metal poor tail extending towards the direction opposite to the main cold front ; an overall central abundance enhancement with a small - scale `` dip '' at the core , and marginal evidence for other off - center abundance dips . the multiplicity of cold fronts together with the spiral pattern of the chemical gradients seem to rule out the scenario , where the cold front(s ) in this cluster are created by a head - on merging remnant core .",
    "although gas sloshing has been invoked to explain cold fronts in apparently relaxed clusters , there have been very few observable predictions that can be used to discriminate the details of different sloshing mechanisms proposed in the literature .",
    "very recently , am06 performed high resolution numerical + hydrodynamical simulations specifically designed to investigate the effects of scattering of lower mass dark matter haloes ( with and without gas ) by clusters of galaxies . one of the results from their work was that the sub - halo flyby induces a variable gas velocity field in the icm of the main cluster that generates ram - pressure near the cluster gas core and produces cold fronts , accompanied by significant amount of substructures seen in the gas 2-d temperature distribution .",
    "a common feature in most cases analyzed by am06 was the presence of cold spiral arms coinciding with the cold fronts close to the main cluster s core , which were long lasting .",
    "in particular , their case for a dark matter perturber produces properties very similar to those observed in a496 . in am06 a pure dark matter halo with @xmath21 of the mass of the main cluster flies by with an impact parameter of 500 kpc and with closest approach at t@xmath11.37 gyr .",
    "we show part of figure 7 of am06 , for the epoch corresponding to 1.9 gyr ( figure 5a ) .",
    "the image is inverted vertically to be compared directly to the temperature map of a496 in figure 2a .",
    "the size of the box is 250 kpc , similar to the size of acis - s3 ccd borders at the redshift of the cluster ( @xmath1320 kpc ) .",
    "the cold front(s ) can be seen when comparing the temperature map with the surface brightness map ( figure 21 of am06 ) .",
    "the main cold front coincides with the large spiral cold arm extending horizontally .",
    "the spatial scale is very similar to that of the cold arm in a496 .",
    "their simulations also seem to indicate the presence of milder cold fronts in the opposite side closer to cluster s core .",
    "these are clear predictions that are corroborated well by a496 and suggest strongly that a flyby dark matter halo created the cold fronts in this cluster .",
    "furthermore , there is a larger - scale more diffuse cold extension of the main arm also towards the south of the main cold front , which is a consequence of the ram - pressure caused by the gas velocity field induced by the dm halo flyby .",
    "this suggests that the same process that creates the main cold front may also be associated with the formation of the southern cold tail seen in a496 .",
    "the existence of such pure dm sub - halos is not completely unexpected since the intergalactic gas originally belonging to the sub - halo could have been stripped in a previous encounter with the main cluster .",
    "am06 cases for _ gaseous _ dm sub - clump passages produces a variety of substructures visible in temperatures _ and surface brightness _ maps , which are not seen in a496 , and are not favored within the limited cases simulated .",
    "future addition of metallicity distributions to cluster merger simulations should constrain further the characteristics of the perturber .",
    "a prediction of this scenario is the presence of a dm halo in the outskirts of the cluster without significant x - ray emitting gas . from the simulations ,",
    "the position of that clump at epoch ( t=2 gyr , i.e. , now ) would be towards its apocenter at north , the same general direction of the main cold front .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that galaxies would tend to trace their host dm sub - halo .",
    "recent wavelet analysis of the member galaxies of a496 within a 1.5 h@xmath22 mpc radius ( flin & krywult 2006 ) , finds a secondary galaxy clump , in most wavelet scales analyzed , to the nw of the core of a496 , roughly consistent with the position where the dm perturber was likely to be found in the am 06 simulation ( towards the north ) .",
    "we illustrate this in figure 5b , where we show the positions of the dark matter clump at 1.34 , 1.43 , 1.51 and 4.2 gyr , taken from a merging 4 of the 9 images of figure 3 of am06 .",
    "we overlap part of figure 5 of flin & krywult ( 2006 ) , which illustrates the position of the galaxy sub - clump for a wavelet scale of 129 h@xmath22 kpc .    if we scale the ratio of masses of the main cluster to hat of the dm perturber from the am06 simulation parameters and , conservatively , use for a496 the mass of 4.2@xmath2310@xmath24m@xmath25 ( durret",
    "et al . 2000 ) , the perturber should be very massive ( 0.84@xmath2310@xmath24m@xmath25 ) .",
    "this is almost three times more massive than hcg62 ( morita et al .",
    "2006 ) , the brightest hcg in the ponman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) survey .",
    "such a group , if not unusually depleted of gas , would easily be detected by current x - ray instruments at the a496 redshift .",
    "rosat all sky survey exposures of that region ( r@xmath20 50@xmath4 from a496 ) fails to detect a significant x - ray excess from any extended sources as expected by the gasless dark matter perturber scenario described here .",
    "the excess count in a square region 18@xmath26 on the side centered in flin & krywult s ( 2006 ) sub clump is 15@xmath018 background subtracted counts .",
    "however rass exposures are too short ( @xmath1250 sec ) to place any significant constraints on the amount of x - ray emitting gas and future combination of weak lensing and deeper x - ray observations of that substructure with current satellites should be able to corroborate this prediction .",

    "<S> sharp edges in x - ray surface brightness with continuous gas pressure called cold fronts have been often found in relaxed galaxy clusters such as abell 496 . </S>",
    "<S> models that explain cold fronts as surviving cores of head - on subcluster mergers do not work well for these clusters and competing models involving gas sloshing have been recently proposed . here , we test some concrete predictions of these models in a combined analysis of density , temperature , metal abundances and abundance ratios in a deep exposure of abell 496 . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that the chemical discontinuities found in this cluster are not consistent with a core merger remnant scenario . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find chemical gradients across a spiral `` arm '' discovered at 73 kpc north of the cluster center and coincident with the sharp edge of the main cold front in the cluster . despite the overall sn ia iron mass fraction dominance found within the cooling radius of this cluster , </S>",
    "<S> the metal enrichment along the arm , determined from silicon and iron abundances , is consistent with a lower sn ia iron mass fraction ( 51%@xmath014% ) than that measured in the surrounding regions ( 85%@xmath014% ) . </S>",
    "<S> the `` arm '' is also significantly colder than the surroundings by 0.51.6 kev . </S>",
    "<S> the arm extends from a boxy colder region surrounding the center of the cluster , where two other cold fronts are found . </S>",
    "<S> this cold arm is a prediction of current high resolution numerical simulations as a result of an off - center encounter with a less massive pure dark matter halo and we suggest that the cold fronts in a496 provide the first clear corroboration of such model , where the closest encounter happened @xmath1 0.5 gyr ago . </S>",
    "<S> we also argue for a possible candidate dark matter halo responsible for the cold fronts in the outskirts of a496 .    </S>",
