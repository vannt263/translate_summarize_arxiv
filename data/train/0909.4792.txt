    "among the objects discovered in the course of hunting for supernovae ( sne ) are transient sources that are fainter and have slower expansion speeds than most core - collapse sne . following the historical examples ( see humphreys et al .  1999 , and references therein ) of the 19th century eruption of @xmath0  carinae , the 17th century eruption of p  cygni , sn  1954j ( variable 12 in ngc  2403 ) , and sn  1961v , these transients have usually been associated with nonterminal eruptions of luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) , rather than final explosions that mark the deaths of massive stars",
    "lbvs represent a highly unstable , rapid mass - loss phase in the late evolution of massive stars ( see smith & owocki 2006 ; smith et al .",
    "2004 ; humphreys & davidson 1994 ) , which is still poorly understood .",
    "p  cygni and @xmath0  car remain as luminous well - studied blue supergiants , and the survivor of sn  1954j has been identified as a luminous dust - enshrouded star ( smith et al .",
    "2001 ; van dyk et al .",
    "sn  1961v is a more controversial case ( chu et al.2004 ) , but there are indications of a surviving star as well ( goodrich et al",
    ".  1989 ; filippenko et al .  1995 ; van dyk et al .  2002 ) . because the massive stars are thought to survive the events , recent examples of these @xmath0  car analogs such as sn  1997bs ( van dyk et al .",
    "2002 ) have earned the label `` sn impostors . '' for most recent extragalactic examples , however , available evidence that the star has survived remains inconclusive .",
    "interest in and interpretation of these transients was stirred by the surprising discovery that two recent events , sn  2008s and the 2008 optical transient in ngc  300 ( hereafter n300-ot ) , both had relatively low - luminosity , dust - enshrouded progenitor stars ( prieto et al .  2008 ; prieto 2008 ) .",
    "although the outburst properties resembled those of known lbv eruptions , interpretation of their dusty progenitors ( prieto et al .",
    "2008 ; thompson et al .",
    "2009 ) implied initial masses below the usually recognized initial - mass range for lbvs extending down to @xmath420  m@xmath1 ( smith et al .",
    "this fueled a range of speculation that these transients might be similar eruptive phenomena extending to somewhat lower mass and cooler stars ( smith et al.2009 ; berger et al .",
    "2009a ; bond et al .  2009 ) , the eruptive birth of a white dwarf and planetary nebula in stars with initial masses below 8 m@xmath1 ( thompson et al .",
    "2009 ) , electron - capture sne ( ecsne ) in extreme asymptotic giant branch ( eagb ) stars around 810 m@xmath1 ( thompson et al .  2009 ; botticella et al .",
    "2009 ) , faint core - collapse sne ( see pastorello et al .",
    "2007 in regard to previous events ) , or mergers / mass - transfer events related to some other recent transients ( e.g. , kulkarni et al .  2007 ; kashi et al .",
    "interpretation of these objects remains controversial and puzzling .",
    "gogarten et al .  (",
    "2009 ) found a likely initial mass of 1225 m@xmath1 for the n300-ot progenitor based on the star - formation history of its local neighborhood , challenging the ecsn or white - dwarf birth hypotheses .",
    "deriving a likely initial mass around 1012 m@xmath1 from the luminosity ( e.g. , prieto et al .",
    "2008 ) depends upon the assumption that the progenitor was a cool eagb star at the uppermost tip of its agb .",
    "it remains possible , however , that the progenitors of sn  2008s and n300-ot were relatively blue stars that were heavily obscured by circumstellar dust ( prieto et al .",
    "2008 ; smith et al .  2009",
    "; berger et al .  2009a ; bond et al .  2009 ) . in that case , the initial mass implied by the progenitor s infrared ( ir ) luminosity would be closer to 1520 m@xmath1 for n300-ot , and would therefore be in better agreement with the findings of gogarten et al .",
    "( 2009 ) than an 810 m@xmath1 eagb star .",
    "the somewhat lower luminosity of the progenitor of sn  2008s would imply 1215 m@xmath1 under the same assumption ( smith et al .",
    "2009 ) .    in this paper",
    "we discuss another pair of newly discovered transients with identified progenitors , the 2009 optical transient in ugc  2773 ( hereafter u2773-ot ) and sn  2009ip ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : finder ] ) .",
    "u2773-ot occurred in the dwarf irregular galaxy ugc  2773 , and was discovered ( boles 2009 ) on 2009 aug .",
    "18.08 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) .",
    "sn  2009ip was discovered ( maza et al .",
    "2009 ) on 2009 aug .",
    "26.11 in the sb galaxy ngc  7259 .",
    "both objects had discovery absolute magnitudes fainter than @xmath514  mag , and they had spectra with narrow h emission lines ( berger et al .  2009b ; berger & foley 2009 ) .",
    "these transient outbursts , still currently ongoing , share properties in common with giant lbv eruptions as well as sn  2008s and n300-ot . in these new cases , however , the progenitors are not as heavily obscured by dust .",
    "the progenitors are detected at optical wavelengths , and they exhibit pre - eruption variability that is matched by classic lbvs such as v12 and @xmath0  car .",
    "we reported the preliminary pre - outburst detections of sn  2009ip in miller et al.(2009 ) , while our photometry of u2773-ot is documented here for the first time . based on their lbv - like pre - outburst variability , the two new transients help bridge the gap between classical lbv eruptions and objects similar to sn  2008s and n300-ot .",
    "other than the historical cases of sn  1954j and sn  1961v , this is the first discovery of extended 510  yr pre - eruption variability before an extragalactic lbv - like transient .",
    "both sn  2009ip and u2773-ot had observations taken @xmath410  yr prior to discovery with the _ hubble space telescope_/wide field planetary camera 2 ( _ hst_/wfpc2 ) , which we retrieved from the archive and analyzed .",
    "ngc  7259 ( sn",
    "2009ip ) was observed in the f606w filter on 1999 jun .",
    "29 , and ugc  2773 was observed in the f606w and f814w filters on 1999 aug .",
    "14 .    to pinpoint the precise location of the two transients progenitors in the _ hst _ images",
    ", we obtained high - resolution ground - based images for comparison . on 2009 sep .",
    "9 , we observed sn  2009ip in the @xmath6 band with the near - infrared camera 2 ( nirc2 ) using the laser guide star ( lgs ) adaptive optics ( ao ) system ( wizinowich et al.2006 ) on the 10-m keck  ii telescope .",
    "three mosaic pointings , each with three exposures of @xmath7  s , were combined to yield a final stacked image with 9  min total exposure time , a pixel scale of 0@xmath804 pixel@xmath3 , and a field of view of @xmath9 . for u2773-ot",
    ", we took a 20  s guider image with the high - resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ; vogt et al .",
    "1994 ) on the 10-m keck  i telescope on 2009 sep .",
    "the image has a pixel scale of 0@xmath83 pixel@xmath3 and a field of view of @xmath10 .    to perform astrometric solutions between the ground - based and _ hst _ images",
    ", we adopted the technique detailed by li et al .",
    "( 2007 ) using stars present in both the ground - based and _ hst _ images . due to the small field of view of the ground - based images , we are only able to measure the positions for five stars in each field .",
    "the astrometric solutions using iraf / geomap yield a precision of 36 mas and 21 mas for sn 2009ip and u2773-ot , respectively .",
    "the positions of the transients are then mapped onto the _ hst _ images . due to the small available number of stars , we only use second - order polynominals in the astrometic transformations .",
    "we also conducted an additional error analysis by taking out one star and leaving four with which to perform the solution , and repeating this for all stars .",
    "for both transients , the average position from the five separate measurements and the associated uncertainty is fully consistent with the position measured from the solution using all five stars together , so our solutions appear to be stable despite the small number of stars involved .",
    "figure  [ fig : prog ] shows a @xmath11 region of the sites for the transients in the _ hst_/wfpc2 images .",
    "a candidate progenitor is detected for both transients within 1@xmath12 precision of the astrometric solution .",
    "we therefore confirm the candidate progenitors marked in figure  [ fig : prog ] , first proposed for sn  2009ip by our group ( miller et al .",
    "2009 ) and for u2773-ot by berger & foley ( 2009 ) .",

    "photometry for the progenitors is measured with hstphot ( dolphin 2000a , 2000b ) and listed in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "hstphot also reports that both objects have a stellar point - spread function ( psf ) : they belong to type  1 \" ( good star ) , with a sharpness well within the range of @xmath13 0.3 as suggested by leonard et al .",

    "the prolonged eruption , in particular , is highly unusual .",
    "we also show the @xmath55-band light curve of the prototypical lbv eruption sn  1954j ( v12 in ngc  2403 ; shaded gray in figure  [ fig : lc ] ) from tammann & sandage ( 1968 ) , corrected for galactic extinction . before the lbv eruption began , the quiescent star was considerably less luminous than @xmath0  car , with an absolute @xmath55 magnitude of only about @xmath56 to @xmath57 mag .",
    "yet , tammann & sandage ( 1968 ) noted that it was a key example of the class of bright blue irregular variables like those in m31 and m33 ( hubble & sandage 1953 ) , later termed `` lbvs , '' and the star is now known to have survived the event ( smith et al.2001 ; van dyk et al .",
    "the progenitor , v12 , is a member of the less luminous class of lbvs with initial masses of 2040 m@xmath1 ( smith et al .",
    "v12 showed rapid irregular variability in the @xmath45 yr leading up to its outburst , with oscillations of 12 mag .",
    "( this `` flickering '' is discussed more in  3.2 below . )",
    "such rapid variability is unusual , but v12 also has unusually well - sampled pre - eruption photometry .",
    "the cause of these wild oscillations is unknown , but they probably signify a growing instability in the star and herald the approaching runaway of the sn  1954j event itself . , it is worth noting that it was not observed for @xmath47 months before peak , and tammann & sandage ( 1968 ) suspected that a brighter peak magnitude may have occurred during that hiatus from observing .",
    "we indicate this time interval with a dashed line in figs .",
    "[ fig : lc ] and [ fig : lc2 ] . ]",
    "another case to consider is the more recent and well - studied lbv outburst v1 in the nearby dwarf irregular galaxy ngc  2363 .",
    "the absolute @xmath36 light curve from drissen et al .",
    "( 1997 , 2001 ; see also petit et al .",
    "2006 ) is shown with the orange curve in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "( its dwarf host with metallicity similar to that of the small magellanic cloud is particularly relevant for u2773-ot . )",
    "v1 is noteworthy because , again , its lbv eruption came from a star whose initial luminosity was low compared to that of @xmath0 car  in fact , its quiescent pre - outburst luminosity was equivalent to the ir luminosity of sn  2008s , also shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] ( more details are given below ) . during its decade - long outburst in the 1990s ,",
    "its @xmath58 brightened by @xmath43.5 mag and remained so for several years . unlike the historical examples of v12 and @xmath0 car ,",
    "v1 has been subject to detailed non - lte ( local thermodynamic equilibrium ) modeling of its outburst spectrum , revealing log@xmath59 and @xmath60 300400 during its outburst , and a strong stellar wind with @xmath61 km s@xmath3 ( drissen et al .",
    "2001 ) . the radius of the photosphere , however , only increased at a rate of @xmath44 km s@xmath3 ( i.e. , much slower than the steady wind expansion ) , so this was not an explosion . v1",
    "lives within the well - known `` mini - starburst '' giant h  ii region ngc  2366 ( drissen et al .",
    "1997 ) in the galaxy ngc  2363 , surrounded by many young , massive stars .",
    "this is a well - established case of a super - eddington wind outburst from a massive star , despite the apparently low luminosity of its quiescent - phase progenitor .",
    "the lbv outburst of v1 is similar in duration and absolute magnitude to the precursor outbursts of the two new transients presented in this paper , although the v1 lbv outburst has not ( as yet ) culminated in a comparably bright giant eruption phase with @xmath62 mag ; instead , it appears to be an example of a fainter and prolonged lbv eruption .    both sn  2009ip and u2773-ot stand in between @xmath0  car and sn  1954j , with all four objects showing precursor variability in the decade leading up to the peak of their giant eruptions",
    "again , the cause for this is not known , but the phenomenon is a well - established property of some lbvs ( e.g. , humphreys et al .",
    "this precursor variability and the range of luminosity of the progenitors makes a strong case that sn  2009ip and u2773-ot are , in fact , both _ bona fide _ giant lbv eruptions from massive stars that were in a prolonged outburst phase before their discovery .",
    "figure  [ fig : lc ] also includes some available information for sn  2008s and n300-ot , and their dust - obscured progenitors .",
    "the light curves of their eruptions show peak absolute magnitudes of roughly @xmath514 mag , with a relatively fast decline over 100200 days resembling that of sn  1954j .",
    "their similarity to lbv eruptions was already noted in previous papers ( smith et al .",
    "2009 ; berger et al.2009a ; bond et al .  2009 ; prieto et al .  2008 ; thompson et al .",
    "2009 ) , but they were surprising because of their relatively low - luminosity progenitors compared to lbvs .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : lc ] shows that _ their progenitor luminosities are not that low after all_. the plotted quantities in figure  [ fig : lc ] are the bolometric luminosities derived from fits to the mid - ir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) measured in _",
    "data ( prieto et al.2008 ; prieto 2008 ; bond et al .",
    "2009 ) . while their luminosities may overlap with the most extreme agb stars at the very tip of their evolution ( thompson et al .",
    "2009 ) , the luminosity of n300-ot is the same as the pre - outburst luminosity of v12 in ngc  2403 , known to be an lbv , and is very close to the pre - outburst luminosity of u2773-ot .",
    "the ir luminosity of the sn  2008s progenitor is only a factor of @xmath42 less , and is comparable to the quiescent luminosity of the lbv v1 in ngc  2363 .",
    "this makes it plausible that both of these transients were moderately massive stars , comparable to or somewhat less massive than v12 .",
    "this lbv connection is reinforced by a spectral comparison , discussed later .",
    "an obvious caveat is that we are comparing integrated ir luminosities of dust - enshrouded progenitors ( for sn  2008s and n300-ot ) to estimates of the luminosity based on visual - wavelength photometry .",
    "the comparison in figure  [ fig : lc ] assumes bolometric corrections of zero for the optically identified sources , and does not include possible ir excesses or correction for local extinction , so these luminosities are actually lower limits . however , the integrated mid - ir luminosities of sn  2008s and n300-ot are also lower limits , since they only represent the luminosity absorbed and reradiated by warm dust , whereas radiation may escape in other directions that we can not see without heating dust if the dust shells are nonspherical ( in the case of an edge - on dust torus , for example ) . in any case ,",
    "further corrections beyond the values shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] become very uncertain , but could only raise the luminosities shown here .      the photometric behavior around the time of peak luminosity is unusual for both transients .",
    "figure  [ fig : lc2 ] shows the same light curves as in figure  [ fig : lc ] , but on an expanded scale to illustrate the details of the giant eruptions themselves .    in the 5 yr before discovery , u2773-ot was apparently in an unstable pre - outburst state .",
    "it continually rose in brightness , culminating in its peak absolute @xmath23 magnitude of about @xmath512.8 .",
    "the total increase was @xmath63 mag .",
    "it has remained roughly at that luminosity for a few months afterward , showing minor oscillations with amplitudes of no more than 0.2 mag on timescales of several days .",
    "sn  2009ip was different and rather astonishing .",
    "after its precursor eruption @xmath45 yr before discovery , it settled to a fainter state , with only upper limits of about @xmath510 mag at @xmath41 yr before discovery .",
    "this may mark a temporary return to its quiescent state seen by _",
    "hst_. it then brightened to @xmath64 mag , and continued to rise to a peak magnitude even brighter than that of @xmath0  car , at @xmath65 mag .",
    "the total increase in brightness from its pre - outburst state was @xmath44.7 mag .",
    "unexpectedly , however , sn  2009ip suddenly faded by 3.2  mag in @xmath416  days , only to recover again soon after ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lc2 ] ) .",
    "we announced our discovery of this startling dip and recovery shortly before submitting this paper ( li et al .",
    "2009 ) .    in connection with the transients",
    "sn  2008s and n300-ot , one may wonder if their fast decline rates are consistent with lbvs .",
    "in fact , several well - studied lbvs have shown extremely fast decline rates . at @xmath4100  days after peak",
    ", v12/sn  1954j exhibited a very rapid decline rate of 0.05 mag day@xmath3 , comparable to those of sn  2008s and n300-ot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lc2 ] ) .",
    "sn  1997bs also showed an extremely rapid 1.5 mag decline from its peak magnitude in the first 20 days , although that decline rate varied later .",
    "even @xmath0  car had a rapid rise and decline associated with its events in 1837 and 1843 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) .    in this context , the astonishingly fast decline of sn  2009ip from its maximum luminosity is quite important .",
    "its prediscovery luminosity and variability establish that it is a true lbv , yet it fades faster than any of the historical lbvs , sn impostors , or the controversial transients sn  2008s and n300-ot . the sharp fading and rebrightening of sn",
    "2009ip is even more extreme than the fluctuations experienced by @xmath0 car in 1837 and 1843 , providing some assurances that the rapid 19th century fluctuations observed by j. f. w.  herschel may have , in fact , been real , leading him ( see herschel 1847 ) to describe @xmath0  car as `` a star fitfully variable to an astonishing extent ... apparently with no settled period and no regularity of progression . ''    to continue quoting herschel : `` what origin can we ascribe to these sudden flashes and relapses ? '' this old mystery persists , and is made even more extreme by the case of sn  2009ip .",
    "a fading of over 3 mag in 16 days is too fast for most physical mechanisms one can imagine , and is faster than most sne .",
    "it can not be a huge increase in extinction caused by a simple puff of dust formation , since the time for ejected material to reach the dust sublimation radius of 170230 au ( for the observed luminosity of @xmath66 l@xmath1 ) expanding at @xmath4500 km s@xmath3 is much longer  roughly 600800  days depending on grain - condensation temperatures .",
    "we can rule out substantial dust anyway , based on the lack of ir excess during the fading , as discussed below in  3.5 .",
    "furthermore , after the dip , the luminosity of sn  2009ip recovered faster than can be explained by the subsequent thinning of that hypothetical dust .",
    "one can imagine that hydrogen in the high - density wind could recombine quickly , but this requires that the source of ultraviolet ( uv ) photons was suddenly quenched , and it seems inconsistent with our detection of h@xmath25 during the dip . unless it was much hotter than typical lbv eruptions , the photospheric radius of sn  2009ip must have been comparable to the orbit of saturn , but fluctuating as fast as ( or faster than ) the wind s expansion speed , so the sudden ejection of an optically thick shell is perhaps the most likely culprit .",
    "davidson & humphreys ( 1997 ) noted that in the case of @xmath0  car , this rapid fluctuation challenges even the dynamical timescale of the star itself . a fading by more than a factor of 10 over such a short time in sn  2009ip is truly spectacular .",
    "other lbvs show qualitatively similar fading and rebrightening episodes , although less extreme , which we refer to as `` flickering . ''",
    "v12 in ngc  2403 , for example , oscillated wildly in the decade before its eruption ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) , as noted above , with several changes of more than 1 mag on equally short timescales ( tammann & sandage 1968 ) . in the same galaxy ,",
    "v37/sn  2002 kg had a rapid fading and rebrightening episode about 350380 days after peak , as plotted in figure  [ fig : lc2 ] ( see van dyk et al .",
    "this sort of rapid variability argues that short cadences are valuable when obtaining photometry and spectroscopy of these objects , lest one miss a significant mass - loss event . in that case , our method of stacking seasonal data for the prediscovery variability of u2773-ot may have been an oversimplification , which is why we also plot individual measurements in figures  [ fig : lc ] and [ fig : lc2 ] .",
    "figures  [ fig : lrishb ] and [ fig : lrishr ] show the medium - resolution keck / lris spectra at blue and red wavelengths , respectively , of sn  2009ip ( day 25 ) and u2773-ot ( day 34 ) .",
    "these are useful for discussing the general appearance of the spectra , and the differences between the two transients .",
    "we describe the spectral morphology in detail below ; in brief , sn  2009ip resembles typical spectra of lbvs in their hotter state , whereas u2773-ot is exemplary of the complex spectra of lbvs in their cooler state .",
    "the day 25 spectrum of sn  2009ip in figures  [ fig : lrishb ] and [ fig : lrishr ] is dominated by strong balmer lines with lorentzian fwhm widths of @xmath4550 km s@xmath3 and a smooth continuum with an apparent blackbody temperature of @xmath410@xmath67  k. it also shows broad emission profiles of he  i @xmath485876 , 6678 , and 7065 with similar widths ( note that he  i",

    "fig : nad ] ) .",
    "sn  2009ip also exhibits several narrower emission lines which are mostly fe  ii , probably produced in the outer wind .",
    "overall , the spectrum is typical of classical lbvs in their hotter states ( e.g. , hillier et al .",

    "2004 ; smith et al .",

    ". this may be the case in sn  2009ip as well .",
    "by contrast , the day 34 spectrum of u2773-ot is more complicated , with narrower emission lines , numerous narrow blueshifted absorption lines , and a cooler apparent temperature of @xmath47000  k ( this is corrected only for galactic reddening , so the intrinsic temperature may be somewhat warmer ) .",
    "the prominent absorption indicates that the eruption wind of u2773-ot has lower ionization than that of sn  2009ip .",

    "these two preferred states are demonstrated well by each of the two transients in figures  [ fig : lrishb ] and [ fig : lrishr ] .",
    "interestingly , one can find examples where the same star observed at different points in its variability cycle had a spectrum that resembled that of either sn  2009ip or u2773-ot , such as the case of r  127 ( wolf 1989 ; walborn et al .",
    "it may seem puzzling , then , why sn  2009ip is in a hotter spectroscopic state when photometry of the object clearly shows it in mid - eruption .",
    "while this behavior is well established for normal s  dor outbursts , we do not yet fully understand the spectroscopic behavior of giant lbv eruptions because spectra of true giant eruptions of lbvs are rare .",
    "sn  2009ip clearly indicates that an lbv can be hotter than 8000  k during a giant eruption , as is apparently the case for sn  1997bs ( van dyk et al.2002 ) and v1 in ngc  2363 ( drissen et al .",
    "2001 ) .        figure  [ fig : hires1 ] shows a portion of the spectrum surrounding h@xmath25 from the keck / hires observation of u2773-ot obtained on day 22 after discovery .",
    "the spectrum clearly shows narrow components of h@xmath25 and the red [ n  ii ] lines , plus a broader underlying p  cygni profile in h@xmath25 . the total equivalent width of h@xmath25 ( narrow plus broad ) is only @xmath70   .",
    "the underlying broad h@xmath25 p  cygni component can be approximated by an emission component with gaussian fwhm @xmath49 360 km s@xmath3 ( gray curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : hires1 ] ) , plus a gaussian absorption component that causes the p  cygni minimum at @xmath5350 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this assessment based on the day 22 hires spectrum is consistent with the h@xmath25 profile of u2773-ot observed on day 34 with lris ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lrisha ] ) .",
    "this weak underlying broad component also matches the expansion speeds observed by berger & foley ( 2009 ) about 8 days earlier , although they noted this characteristic speed in the p  cygni absorption in the near - ir ca  ii triplet and the full emission fwhm of h@xmath25 .",
    "we take 350 km s@xmath3 to be the expansion speed of the eruption wind from u2773-ot .",
    "it is a typical speed for the winds of blue supergiants and lbv stars , but would be astonishingly slow for any conventional explosion scenario . in particular , it is comparable to the 300  km s@xmath3 wind observed spectroscopically in the lbv eruption v1 in ngc  2363 ( drissen et al.2001 ) , which we mentioned earlier , as well as 370 km s@xmath3 in v37/sn  2002 kg ( van dyk et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the narrow h@xmath25 and [ n  ii ] features have gaussian fwhm @xmath49 49 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the red [ s  ii ] doublet is also detected with the same line width ( not shown ) .",
    "the narrow lines present in the hires extracted spectrum seem to indicate an underlying h  ii region , although 49 km s@xmath3 is quite broad for a simple h  ii region , so these lines may also arise in an extended circumstellar nebula ejected by the star in a previous outburst .",
    "this narrow emission was also seen and spatially resolved in our lris spectra , but the extended emission along the slit and the good seeing allowed us to carefully subtract it .",
    "some [ n  ii ] residuals remain in figure  [ fig : lrisha ] , but the narrow lines are considerably weaker than in figure  [ fig : hires1 ] . in these narrow lines ,",
    "the observed [ s  ii ] @xmath71 ratio is @xmath41.2 , corresponding to a fairly low electron density of @xmath4120 @xmath72 ( e.g. , osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "the presence of an h  ii region coincident with u2773-ot supports the hypothesis that the progenitor of u2773-ot was a young , massive star .",
    "both @xmath0 car and v1 in ngc  2363 are also located within bright , giant h  ii regions . on the other hand , if this narrow emission arises in part from extended circumstellar material , the [ n  ii ] lines and other features are reminiscent of extended lbv nebulae , which tend to be enriched in n ( stahl 1987 ; stahl 1989 ; stahl & wolf 1986 ) .",
    "finally , we show the spectrum in the region of the [ ca  ii ] lines in figure  [ fig : ca2 ] .",
    "these lines were first noted to be strong by berger & foley ( 2009 ) on day 16 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ca2 ] indicates that the [ ca  ii ] lines are detected in both the hires spectrum ( day 22 ) and the lris spectrum ( day 34 ) as well .",
    "the lines have width of roughly 350 km s@xmath3 , comparable to h@xmath25 , although the lines are irregularly shaped , so accurate fwhm values are difficult to determine . another unidentified emission line appears to be seen between the two [ ca  ii ] lines .",
    "figure  [ fig : lrisha ] shows the h@xmath25 profile of sn  2009ip in the medium - resolution lris spectrum , obtained on day 25 just after it recovered from its sharp 3 mag dip .",
    "this is superior to the hires spectrum on 2009 sep .  11 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hires2 ] ) , which had low s / n because it was obtained during the sharp dip .",
    "the h@xmath25 line is extremely bright , with a total emission equivalent width of @xmath5198   , and a flux of @xmath73 erg s@xmath3 @xmath51 .",
    "( this line flux is 3 times brighter than measured in the hires spectrum . )",
    "this corresponds to a total h@xmath25 line luminosity of @xmath74 l@xmath1 .",
    "the h@xmath25 line profile is qualitatively similar several days earlier in the hires spectrum obtained during the dip , but the line flux is weaker .",
    "the h@xmath25 line in sn  2009ip is clearly broader than that of u2773-ot , and it is symmetric , unlike the p  cygni absorption profile seen in u2773-ot . in order to fit the symmetric profile , one would need a composite gaussian with a broad , intermediate , and narrow component .",
    "however , the line profile is fit quite naturally with a single lorentzian profile with fwhm = 550 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the same lorentzian profile adequately accounts for h@xmath25 in the hires spectrum , although that spectrum has a much higher noise level .",
    "as discussed in detail by smith et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for sn  2006gy , a lorentzian profile is probably indicative of multiple electron scattering through an opaque wind , suggesting a very high mass - loss rate for the sn  2009ip eruption . although the h@xmath25 line wings extend to roughly @xmath132000 km s@xmath3 at zero intensity , the lorentzian profile suggests that these are electron - scattering wings and not true kinematic speeds of outflowing material .",
    "we therefore adopt 550 km s@xmath3 as the characteristic outflow speed of sn  2009ip , in agreement with the earlier assessment by berger et al .",
    "( 2009b ) , although they did not specifically mention the lorentzian profile .",
    "this speed is faster than the 300370 km s@xmath3 expansion observed in u2773-ot , v1 in ngc  2363 ( drissen et al .",
    "2001 ) , and v37/sn  2002 kg ( van dyk et al .",
    "2006 ) , and it is closer to the 600 km s@xmath3 outflow speed around more massive lbvs like the homunculus of @xmath0  car ( smith 2006 ) . despite this connection , it is unclear if there is a trend of higher outflow speeds in more luminous objects , because the outflow speeds were even higher in sn  2008s and n300-ot , where the progenitors were less luminous . in figure",
    "[ fig : ca2 ] we also show the medium - resolution lris spectrum in the wavelength range corresponding to the red [ ca  ii ] lines , plotted along with the same wavelength range in u2773-ot .",
    "it is clear that the [ ca  ii ] lines are not detected in sn  2009ip .",
    "most spectral lines in both transients discussed here agree with the outflow velocities determined from h@xmath25 , discussed above , and we take these to be the dominant outflow speeds for each object . in u2773-ot",
    "the characteristic speeds are of order 350 km s@xmath3 , while the characteristic speeds of 550 km s@xmath3 for sn  2009ip are higher .",
    "the h@xmath25 profile in sn  2009ip does show wings extending to @xmath132000 km s@xmath3 , but these seem consistent with electron - scattering wings in a lorentzian profile , as discussed above .",
    "there are , however , signs of some faster material in sn  2009ip .",
    "figure  [ fig : nad ] shows the region of the spectrum including he  i @xmath535876 and the na  i d lines , seen in the low - resolution lris spectra of both targets ( this spectral window was not included in the blue or red medium - resolution lris spectra in figs .",
    "[ fig : lrishb ] and [ fig : lrishr ] ) .",
    "the na  i d line in u2773-ot shows a narrow p cygni profile , with an absorption trough consistent with outflow speeds in other lines ; there is no sign of he  i emission or fast material .",
    "sn  2009ip , on the other hand , shows interesting new structure in this line . aside from a narrow emission peak at the systemic velocity of na",
    "i d , the feature is dominated by a broad he  i @xmath535876 p  cygni profile .",
    "the emission component has a width and wings consistent with other he  i lines in the spectrum like @xmath536678 and @xmath537065 , as well as the symmetric wings of h@xmath25 .",
    "the blueshifted absorption of he  i @xmath535876 , however , is the only line detected in our spectra that provides clear evidence for faster outflow speeds of roughly 30005000 km s@xmath3 .",
    "these outflow speeds seen only in absorption exceed the characteristic speed of 550 km s@xmath3 seen in emission lines in the spectrum of sn  2009ip .",
    "this is reminiscent of the two ranges of outflow speeds seen in @xmath0 car : most of the mass in the homunculus nebula expands at 500600 km s@xmath3 ( smith 2006 ) , whereas recent spectra of faint material exterior to that reveal much faster material moving at 30006000 km s@xmath3 ( smith 2008 ) .",
    "the kinematics are consistent with both components originating in the same event in the 1840s , implying that @xmath0 car s giant eruption also had a fast blast wave containing a comparable amount of kinetic energy but far less mass than the slower homunculus nebula ( smith 2008 ) .",
    "the fast 30005000 km s@xmath3 material seen in absorption in sn  2009ip , along with the dominant speeds of 550 km s@xmath3 in most emission lines , may suggest a similar scenario with a blast wave ahead of the slower ejecta for sn  2009ip . indeed , the coexistence of narrow components of 550 km s@xmath3 along with an intermediate - width component of a few 10@xmath75 km s@xmath3 is also reminiscent of the broader class of sne  iin ( see the discussion of line profiles in smith et al .",
    "2010 and chugai & danziger 1994 ) , although the intermediate - width components tend to be stronger in sne  iin .",
    "if this fast material is evidence for a weak blast wave in sn  2009ip , then there are several interesting implications beyond the connection to @xmath0  car .",
    "first , shocks can heat material above the equilibrium radiation temperature and may produce additional ionizing radiation , so this might help explain the duality of spectra seen in u2773-ot and sn  2009ip .",
    "namely , it may help explain why sn  2009ip had a relatively hot spectrum , even though super - eddington lbv eruptions are expected to appear cooler ( more like u2773-ot ; see humphreys & davidson 1994 ) .",
    "second , the existence of a shock on day 25 ( during the second peak ) may hint that a shock - breakout event could be responsible for the initial rise to peak luminosity and astonishingly sudden decline , whereas the resurgence after the dip might then be explained by the beginning of shock interaction with surrounding circumstellar material , as in standard sne  iin .",
    "a shock breakout has never before been claimed in an lbv eruptive event , and the suggestion is still quite speculative , but it may nevertheless have some application to other events .",
    "unfortunately , we are not able to obtain spectra or multi - band photometry during the initial peak of sn  2009ip , so we can not determine if the temperature was very high as one might expect from shock breakout , but sn  2009ip warns that we should be on the lookout for this behavior in future lbv eruptions .      our low - resolution spectra of sn  2009ip and u2773-ot are shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "these were obtained on the same night with keck / lris , and correspond to days 25 and 34 after discovery for sn  2009ip and u2773-ot , respectively .",
    "sn  2009ip is dominated by a very blue ( @xmath76 10,000  k ) continuum and bright balmer emission lines , characteristic of lbvs .",
    "it is compared to the spectrum of the lbv eruption sn  1997bs in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "the dereddened low - resolution spectrum of u2773-ot shows a blue continuum as well , with a lower apparent temperature around 7000  k. it also has balmer emission lines , although much narrower as noted earlier and riddled with many deep blueshifted absorption features indicating an underlying spectrum like an f supergiant with strong wind lines , characteristic of many lbvs ( see  3.3 ) , as well as emission from [ ca  ii ] and the ca  ii near - ir triplet .",
    "the ca  ii h & k lines show strong , broad absorption , like sn  2008s and n300-ot .",
    "the spectrum of u2773-ot in figure  [ fig : spec ] is similar to those of sn  2008s and irc+10420 ( and by extension , n300-ot ) , although with somewhat weaker [ ca  ii ] lines , and with more pronounced and more numerous p  cygni absorption features .",
    "our spectra of sn  2009ip and u2773-ot agree qualitatively with preliminary reports of the spectra .",
    "berger et al .  ( 2009b ) obtained a medium - resolution spectrum of sn  2009ip shortly after discovery , and noted that it exhibited narrow ( fwhm @xmath49 550 km s@xmath3 ) balmer emission lines , in agreement with our spectrum on day 25 .",
    "berger & foley ( 2009 ) obtained spectra of u2773-ot and noted similarly narrow ( fwhm @xmath49 350 km s@xmath3 ) balmer emission lines , in agreement with our hires and lris spectra described above , plus [ ca  ii ] , ca  ii , and a few other emission features .",
    "taken at face value , one might conclude from these spectral characteristics that u2773-ot is closely related to the recent transients sn  2008s and n300-ot , which were discovered to have unusually bright [ ca  ii ] emission in their spectra ( smith et al .",
    "2009 ; berger et al .  2009a",
    "; bond et al .",
    "2009 ) , whereas sn  2009ip is apparently not .",
    "the other very unusual characteristic shared by sn  2008s and n300-ot is that both had heavily dust - enshrouded progenitors detected only in _",
    "data ( prieto 2008 ; prieto et al .",
    "2008 ) , and significant dust was still present around both at late times ( prieto et al .  2009 ; wesson et al .",
    "does this connection between [ ca  ii ] emission and dust hold for the two new transients discussed here ?    sn  2009ip was detected at @xmath420.2 mag in an unfiltered keck guider image on 2009 sep .",
    "11 . assuming this guider image closely approximates the @xmath23 band , this means the @xmath77 color was @xmath40.5 mag at this epoch , compared to our near - ir image taken 2 days earlier .",
    "given the fast optical decline of sn  2009ip at this time ( @xmath42 mag between aug .",
    "30 and sep .",
    "11 ) , however , it is likely that @xmath78 was even less than 0.5  mag .",
    "thus , we measure very little if any near - ir excess in sn  2009ip .",
    "it must have had little circumstellar dust near the star to cause excess emission or circumstellar extinction , in direct contrast to n300-ot and sn  2008s which had @xmath79 mag and @xmath41.7 mag , respectively , at peak optical output ( bond et al .",
    "2009 ; botticella et al .",
    "for both of these transients the @xmath78 color evolved redward as they declined .",
    "u2773-ot , on the other hand , does show a considerable near - ir excess . after correcting for galactic extinction",
    ", we find that u2773-ot had @xmath80 mag on 2009 sep .",
    "figure  [ fig : ir ] shows that its near - ir / optical color has remained relatively unchanged since then , as it brightened by @xmath40.2 mag over 100 days .",
    "its near - ir excess is comparable to that of sn  2008s in eruption .",
    "regardless of whether the near - ir color excess is caused by reddening from circumstellar dust or emission from heated dust , the ir excess points to a dusty environment around u2773-ot .",
    "( the ir excess might also be caused in part by newly formed dust , although a more detailed study of the evolving spectral energy distribution and line profiles would be needed to investigate this further . )",
    "it therefore appears that u2773-ot did indeed have a substantially dusty circumstellar environment to accompany its [ ca  ii ] emission  like sn  2008s and n300-ot  while sn  2009ip had neither .",
    "the dusty environment around the u2773-ot progenitor was not as fully obscuring as the dust around the progenitors of sn  2008s and n300-ot , although in those cases the progenitor obscuration was due mostly to a more compact distribution of dust that seems to have been largely destroyed by their luminous outbursts ( wesson et al .",
    "2010 ; prieto et al .",
    "2009 ) , leaving more distant dust shells comparable to that seen now around u2773-ot .",
    "the dust around u2773-ot is also reminiscent of the dusty environments inferred around the transients m85-ot and sn  1999bm , which led thompson et al .",
    "( 2009 ) to place those two objects in the same class with sn  2008s and n300-ot .",
    "this is intriguing , since we have shown that _ both _",
    "sn  2009ip and u2773-ot were otherwise very similar , with pre - eruption lbv variability in the decade before discovery , luminous lbv - like progenitors , and very narrow line widths that were even narrower than those of sn  2008s or n300-ot but characteristic of lbvs .",
    "one must therefore conclude that the presence of strong [ ca  ii ] and ca  ii emission _ can not be taken as evidence for or against an lbv nature_. instead , [ ca  ii ] emission is more closely related to the progenitor s circumstellar environment  especially the presence of dust .",
    "it was already noted that the bright [ ca   ii ] and ca  ii lines in sn  2008 and n300-ot are probably related to dense circumstellar gas and pre - existing circumstellar dust grains that were vaporized by the increased outburst radiation ( prieto et al .",
    "2008 ; smith et al .",
    "the corresponding implications for sn  2008s and n300-ot are discussed further in  4.2 .",
    "a dusty circumstellar environment around the progenitor of u2773-ot affects our estimates of the progenitor properties , as noted above . from _",
    "photometry corrected only for galactic extinction and reddening , we found that the quiescent progenitor ( @xmath410 yr before discovery ) had a color consistent with that of an early a - type supergiant having a luminosity of log@xmath81 , and an initial mass of roughly 20  m@xmath1 . with substantial circumstellar dust , the progenitor of u2773-ot must have been even hotter than an early a - type star , and more luminous and massive as well , although one can not make precise corrections with available information .",
    "it is difficult to escape the conclusion that u2773-ot was blue , quite luminous , and obviously highly variable , so it was therefore likely to have been an lbv .",
    "its spectral morphology confirms this .",
    "conversely , there was little pre - existing circumstellar dust around sn  2009ip , which is reassuring because its quiescent progenitor with @xmath82  mag would already be among the most luminous stars known , and any significant amount of dust would raise the corresponding progenitor luminosity .",
    "a critical new result from this study is that we have recovered the luminous progenitor stars and precursor variability in the decade preceding the discovery of sn  2009ip and u2773-ot , and that the luminosity and variability are characteristic of known lbvs like @xmath0  car , sn  1954j ( v12 ) , and v1 in ngc  2363 .",
    "before these precursor outbursts began , the two stars were apparently at quiescent absolute magnitudes of @xmath83 to @xmath84 mag , implying moderately massive and very massive progenitor stars for u2773-ot and sn  2009ip , respectively .",
    "we propose that the apparent brightening episodes in the @xmath410 yr before the giant lbv eruptions of sn  2009ip and u2773-ot were caused by preparatory outburst phases , akin to s  dor - like variability , which then grew into giant eruptions as is thought to be the case for the precursor behavior of @xmath0  car and sn  1954j ( humphreys et al.1999 ) .",
    "sn  1961v may have also been in an s  dor phase for 1020 yr preceding its giant eruption ( goodrich et al .  1989 ) .    the visual brightening identified as s  dor outbursts , named for the famous prototype lbv star in the large magellanic cloud , occurs when the star varies at roughly constant @xmath85 , but brightens roughly 12.5 mag at visual wavelengths because it becomes cooler , redistributing its peak flux from the uv to visual wavelengths ( see humphreys & davidson 1994 ) .",
    "s  dor outbursts are a _ defining _ observed phenomenon in lbvs , although not every s  dor phase is followed by a giant eruption . the namesake of the class , for example , has never been observed in a giant eruption , but only smaller oscillations .",
    "the situation can be more complicated as well : s  dor - like variability may evolve into larger outbursts .",
    "for example , the 1990s eruption of v1 in ngc  2363 may not have been a simple s  dor phase , because its bolometric luminosity increased ( drissen et al.2001 ) , and we should be mindful that this may be the case for our two new transients discussed here as well . in any case , lbvs exhibit a wide variety in @xmath86 and @xmath87 , but a few to 10 yr is a typical observed timescale for these s  dor variations ( see humphreys & davidson 1994 ; van genderen 2001 ) .    as noted earlier , neither s  dor outbursts nor giant lbv eruptions have a theoretical explanation , although they are suspected to be the result of luminous stars flirting with an opacity - modified eddington limit and subsequent runaway mass loss ( e.g. , smith & owocki 2006 ; humphreys & davidson 1994 ; smith et al .  2003 ; owocki et al .",
    "sn  2009ip and u2773-ot are important in this context because they add two new well - observed cases to the three historical examples of precursor variability before a giant lbv eruption , and unlike the historical examples , we also have obtained spectra of their eruptions which resemble other recent sn impostors without documented pre - eruption lbv - like variability .    given the stark differences from one object to the next , and the presence of `` preparatory '' precursor outbursts in the decade preceding maximum light for some objects , one wonders to what extent there is cumulative hysteresis built into the system .",
    "for example , to what extent does the peak luminosity output and rate of decline depend systematically on the pre - eruption variability and its associated mass loss ? at this time such questions are still quite speculative , but a larger sample of these transients with good observations would obviously be valuable to establish any such trends .      the spectrum of one object we discussed here , u2773-ot , resembles the optical spectra of sn  2008s , n300-ot , and irc+10420 , as noted above .",
    "the other , sn  2009ip , matches spectra of sn impostor lbvs like sn  1997bs that are dominated by balmer lines alone . yet , based on the luminous progenitors and their s  dor variability , we have identified _ both _",
    "sn  2009ip and u2773-ot as giant lbv eruptions .",
    "this link reinforces earlier suggestions that sn  2008s and n300-ot may also have been related to lbv - like eruptions , albeit with relatively low - luminosity ( and possibly cooler ) dust - obscured progenitors .",
    "it also suggests that some giant lbv eruptions have bright [ ca  ii ] and ca  ii emission lines while some do not .",
    "several authors have noted that the bright [ ca  ii ] and ca  ii lines are probably related to dense circumstellar gas and the destruction of dust grains ( prieto et al .",
    "2008 ; smith et al .  2009 ; this work ) . in the case of irc+10420 , this dust destructionm ( e.g. , humphreys et al .",
    "although irc+10420 is more luminous , the ratio between its 8 @xmath88 and optical @xmath23-band flux is similar to the observed colors of sn  2008s and n300-ot .",
    "] occurs because the star has been growing much warmer over the past 30 years , and increasing its uv output ( see smith et al .",
    "2009 ; humphreys et al.2002 ) . in the transients",
    ", it occurs because of the sudden increase in luminosity that pushes the grain sublimation radius farther into the progenitor s dust shell .    among known lbvs ,",
    "some are dusty , and some are not .",
    "some have no detected circumstellar shells , while others like @xmath0  car have 15 m@xmath1 dust shells ( smith et al .",
    "2003 ) that reprocess nearly all of the star s uv and visual radiation .",
    "the difference depends on the star s previous mass - loss history ( i.e. , how recently it has ejected a massive dust shell , and how fast that dust shell expands and thins ) .",
    "regardless of its initial mass , a star that has recently suffered an lbv - like eruptive event could be completely obscured at optical wavelengths , while its ir / optical colors would evolve rapidly over the subsequent century",
    ". the obscured phase could be very brief and mostly missed in samples of known lbvs , in agreement with the expected short duration implied by the rarity of similar dust obscured stars ( thompson et al .",
    "if strong [ ca  ii ] emission is indeed linked to vaporizing circumstellar dust , then it would not be surprising to have some giant lbv eruptions with strong [ ca  ii ] emission and some with only weak emission or none .",
    "for example , valeev et al .",
    "( 2009 ) recently reported a new lbv in m33 , which has a dust shell and bright [ ca  ii ] emission .",
    "another key issue is the variability of the progenitors .",
    "the lack of ir variability in the progenitors of sn  2008s and n300-ot seems problematic for their interpretation as eagb stars that become ecsne .",
    "all stars at the tip of the agb pulsate with large amplitudes ( e.g. , mira variables ) .",
    "thompson et al .  ( 2009 ) demonstrated clearly that over timescales of a few years in the same irac bands , known eagb stars are highly variable ( @xmath89 is typically @xmath41 mag ) , whereas lbv candidates with dust shells are not highly variable ( a few exceptions have @xmath89 as much as 0.5 mag ) .",
    "one reason for this is that although lbvs are variable at visual wavelengths during s  dor - like episodes , their _ bolometric _ luminosity remains roughly constant .",
    "recall that the observed visual - wavelength brightening in s  dor outbursts is thought to be a redistribution of flux from the uv to optical  i.e. , a change in bolometric correction at constant luminosity .",
    "since the dust properties depend primarily on the central engine s bolometric output , one may expect the mid - ir luminosity of a circumstellar dust shell around an lbv to be nearly constant  that is , until it experiences a giant eruption when the bolometric luminosity actually climbs .",
    "sn  1954j / v12 is a key example to keep in mind when debating the nature of sn  2008s and n300-ot , because it is a well - established lbv , but its luminosity was comparable to the relatively low luminosities of the two dust - enshrouded transients .",
    "the two new sources we report here appear to bridge the gap between these examples and more luminous lbvs .",
    "if sn  2008s and n300-ot were blue supergiants that were heavily obscured by dust , then the initial masses implied by their ir luminosities are higher than if one assumes that they are at the tip of an ascending agb / rsg branch .",
    "one can not confidently determine the effective temperature or color of an underlying star from the mid - ir dust emission properties ; for example , in the mid - ir color plots presented by thompson et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , @xmath0 car had the same _ spitzer _ colors as the very cool red supergiant vy  cma . altogether ,",
    "then , we find the case to be still quite plausible that sn  2008s and n300-ot may have been eruptions analogous to episodic lbv - like events , at lower initial masses than had previously been recognized .",
    "the variety among this class of objects may be telling us that episodic mass loss and eruptive phenomena are a generic property of late evolutionary phases over a wide range of initial masses , whatever the underlying cause .",
    "still , there are some key differences between lbvs and sn  2008s / n300-ot which remain unsolved even if these are not episodic lbv - like eruptions .",
    "one is the apparently c - rich chemistry in the circumstellar dusty envelope of n300-ot ( prieto et al .",
    "non - silicate dust was also inferred for sn  2008s ( wesson et al.2010 ) .",
    "massive stars are generally not found to be c - rich for long periods except in the wc wolf - rayet phase , providing the most compelling argument made for a connection to eagb stars ( prieto et al .",
    "2009 ; thompson et al .",
    "this is puzzling as well , though , since c - rich agb stars are thought to come from lower - mass stars ( jura 1991 ) , well below the n300-ot progenitor mass of 1225 m@xmath1 inferred by gogarten et al .",
    "furthermore , the c enrichment in single carbon stars is thought to arise from dredge up during unstable he shell burning over a degenerate c - o core .",
    "one expects progenitors of ecsne to avoid this enrichment , however , because they do not make a degenerate c - o core , instead burning carbon to eventually produce the o - ne - mg core that collapses ( e.g. , nomoto 1984 ) . with such mysteries ,",
    "one may feel tempted to appeal to previous episodes of mass transfer in evolved close binary systems for any plausible initial mass range .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that observations of the dust composition in @xmath0 car ( chesneau et al .",
    "2005 ; mitchell & robinson 1978 ; smith 2010 ) have also shown strong evidence for unusual non - silicate dust , such as corundum ( al@xmath90o@xmath91 ) and other species .",
    "the unusual grain composition may be related to the _ rapid _ formation of dust around a hot star , where condensation temperature may compete with chemical abundances in determining the grain composition ( e.g. , smith 2010 ) . in other words ,",
    "the presence of carbon dust may not necessarily result directly from carbon - rich gas - phase abundances .",
    "for many other lbvs , the dust composition has not been studied in detail yet , so an attempt to detect or rule out the presence of carbon - bearing dust or molecules would be interesting .",
    "we have investigated the two recent transients sn  2009ip and u2773-ot .",
    "while they show some spectral differences , we conclude that they are two manifestations of the same underlying phenomenon : namely , they are both giant eruptions of luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) . here",
    "we briefly summarize the main conclusions of our study .",
    "\\(1 ) the quiescent progenitor stars of both transients have been identified in _",
    "images taken @xmath410  yr before discovery .",
    "the progenitor of sn  2009ip was an extremely luminous star with @xmath92  mag , log(@xmath93 , and a probable initial mass of 5080 m@xmath1 .",
    "this places it well above the observed upper limit for red supergiants , so it was either a yellow or blue supergiant .",
    "the progenitor of u2773-ot was somewhat less luminous , at @xmath38  mag and log(@xmath94 , corresponding to an initial mass of @xmath420 m@xmath1 .",
    "it had an observed color similar to that of an early a - type supergiant , consistent with lower - luminosity lbvs .",
    "however , an ir excess reveals that u2773-ot had a dusty environment , so it was most likely hotter , more luminous , and more massive , also consistent with an lbv .",
    "\\(2 ) examining pre - discovery ground - based data , we discovered a long @xmath45  yr history of lbv - like photometric variability in the decade leading up to the peaks of eruption for both transients .",
    "the precursor variability resembles the preparatory s  dor phases that transformed into giant lbv eruptions of @xmath0  car , sn  1954j , and sn  1961v .",
    "we suspect that this early warning sign is an important key for triggering a giant eruption , although many s  dor phases do not result in a giant eruption , and it is unclear if all giant eruptions show precursor outbursts .",
    "\\(3 ) immediately after reaching its peak , we discovered that sn  2009ip took a sharp dive , fading by 3.2 mag in 16 days , followed by an almost immediate recovery to nearly its previous level .",
    "the astonishing decline rate is faster than that of sne , and the recovery is unprecedented .",
    "the closest analog is the visual light curve of @xmath0 car during its 1843 great eruption .",
    "this would suggest that sn  2009ip is physically related to @xmath0 car , and we should not be surprised if its eruption continues . after reaching its peak level , u2773-ot seems to have sustained a relative plateau , with only minor variations at the time of writing .",
    "\\(4 ) optical spectra of the two transients are qualitatively different , but each is characteristic of lbvs at different phases of their variability .",
    "sn  2009ip is dominated by very strong balmer emission lines and outflow speeds of @xmath4550 km s@xmath3 , similar to @xmath0 car . evidently , sn  2009ip did not show a cool photosphere , counter to some expectations for lbv eruptions .",
    "u2773-ot has a cooler 70008000  k spectrum of an f supergiant superposed with wind emission lines and sharp blueshifted absorption features , indicating an outflowing wind of 350 km s@xmath3 .",
    "it is almost identical to the spectrum of s  dor and other lbvs in their cool eruptive phases .",
    "this dichotomy illustrates the wide variety of spectral properties that can be observed in lbv eruptions .",
    "\\(5 ) sn  2009ip also shows evidence for fast material moving at 30005000 km s@xmath3 seen in absorption of he  i @xmath535876 .",
    "these speeds are much faster than most of the mass traced by emission lines ( 550 km s@xmath3 ) , and this combination is quite reminiscent of the slower homunculus and fast blast wave of @xmath0 car ( smith 2008 ) .",
    "we speculate that shock excitation by this fast blast wave may play a role in giving rise to the hotter spectrum of sn  2009ip , and may be related to the sharp initial peak in the light curve .",
    "\\(6 ) the spectrum of u2773-ot has [ ca  ii ] emission and other features reminiscent of the recent transients sn  2008s and n300-ot , as well as an ir excess indicating a dusty environment .",
    "sn  2009ip has neither of these attributes , yet both are clearly lbvs .",
    "this illustrates that the diversity of lbv circumstellar environments can give rise to a wide range of properties such as those seen in sn  2008s and n300-ot , depending on the star s recent mass - loss history .",
    "\\(7 ) we have noted that the progenitor luminosities for some lbvs are much lower than that of @xmath0 car , such as u2773-ot , sn  1954j / v12 , and v1 in ngc  2363 , all of which imply initial masses around 20  m@xmath1 .",
    "the progenitor luminosities of these well - established lbvs overlap with the low ir luminosities of the dust - obscured progenitors of sn  2008s and n300-ot , adding weight to the possibility that these are moderately massive stars of 1215 m@xmath1 that experienced eruptive instability analogous to lbvs .",
