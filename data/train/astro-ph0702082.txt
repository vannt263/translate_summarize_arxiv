    "dependence of @xmath0 on redshift means evolution of the accretion process in cosmic time .",
    "most studies have concluded that there is no evidence for a dependence of @xmath0 on redshift ( e.g. avni @xmath3 tananbaum 1982 ; strateva et al .",

    "2007 ) .    as pointed out by yuan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , one of the problems in such studies is that an apparent , yet artificial correlation between @xmath0 and optical luminosity can be caused by dispersions in the optical luminosity . in section 2 ,",
    "we present analysis of the relationship between @xmath0 and optical / x - ray luminosity using data presented in m06 , in which we find that dispersions in luminosity can be entirely responsible for the claimed dependence .",
    "we also discuss the determining factor for this behavior .",
    "another problem is the degeneracy between redshift and luminosity in flux - limited samples , where redshift and luminosity are strongly correlated . in section 3 ,",
    "we examine a sub - sample from s06 containing 187 agns , which more completely fills the redshift and optical luminosity plane and thus is less affected by such degeneracy . in section 4 , we compare the optical quasar luminosity function from richards et al .",

    "we mostly use the logarithms of luminosities and denote them as @xmath10 and @xmath11 , then @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the 2 kev monochromatic luminosity and @xmath14 is the 2500 @xmath7 monochromatic luminosity in units of erg s@xmath15 hz@xmath15 .",
    "we adopt the currently favored cosmology model with @xmath16=70 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ( e.g. spergel et al .",
    "the sample we use in this section is consisted of 61 high - redshift ( @xmath19 ) quasars in figure 2 of m06 ( miyaji et al .",

    "excluding the three quasars from archival @xmath20 data in table 3 in m06 which might be biased toward higher x - ray fluxes .",
    "only six of them have no x - ray detection .",
    "m06 found a correlation of @xmath0 with optical luminosity for this high - z sample , while they kept the discussion on the @xmath21 relation open because of possible optical selection effects for variable agns which preferentially pick up the optically brighter phases .    to illustrate how dispersions produce artificial correlations in this sample , we carry out two independent analysis",
    "the first one is linear regression of @xmath0 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 in observed data . without further description ,",
    "we perform linear regression using methods as follows throughout the paper :    1 .   for the @xmath1 correlation",
    ", we use the em algorithm in asurv ( isobe , feigelson , & nelson 1986 ) to derive linear regression parameters , including x - ray undetected quasars ; 2 .   the em linear regression algorithm in asurv is based on the traditional ordinary least - squares method which minimizes the residuals of the dependent variable ( ols(y@xmath24x ) ) .",
    "however , for @xmath2 correlation , both variables are observed and a different result can be obtained if residuals of the independent variable are instead minimized ( e.g. s06 ) .",
    "following s06 , we perform linear regression with asurv using em algorithm , treating @xmath23 as the dependent variables ( ils(y@xmath24x ) ) and treating @xmath22 as the dependent variables ( ils(x@xmath24y ) ) , then use the equations given by isobe et al .",
    "( 1990 ) to calculate the bisector of the two regression lines . 3 .   for the @xmath25 , where both independent and dependent variables are upper limits , only schmitt s binned method in asurv is available which may suffer from several drawbacks ( sadler et al .",
    "hence we abandon upper limit points in @xmath25 plane and only use x - ray detected quasars to derive linear regression parameters .",
    "spearman correlation coefficients are calculated using asurv including x - ray undetected quasars .",
    "observational data together with linear regression slopes and spearman correlation coefficients for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath25 correlations are shown in figure 1 .",
    "conflicting correlations arise due to dispersions in luminosity : @xmath26 as shown in solid line in panel ( a ) , but @xmath27 as shown in solid line panel ( c ) .",
    "therefore the same data produce two totally different results : @xmath28 or @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath30 or @xmath31 if @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , depending upon how the regression is done , the conclusion on the relationship between the optical and x - ray luminosities can be significantly different .",
    "as shown in panel ( b ) , the slope of the @xmath2 relation does depend on which luminosity is used as the dependent variable .",

    "( 1998 ) , we assume intrinsic optical and x - ray luminosities @xmath36 and @xmath37 with a constant mean @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 is given by the mean of observed @xmath41 using the kaplan - meier estimator in asurv , including the six quasars with upper limits .",
    "the above relationship is plotted as dotted line in panel ( b ) of figure 1 .",
    "the observed optical and x - ray luminosities are assumed to be the intrinsic luminosities modified by independent gaussian dispersions @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are gaussian distributed dispersions with standard deviations @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively .",
    "thus , the distribution of @xmath0 is gaussian with standard deviation @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the standard deviation around the linear relationship of equation ( 2 ) for this sample , using 55 x - ray detected agns . the ratio of the standard deviations of the optical to the x - ray luminosity dispersion is defined as @xmath49    in the following we make monte carlo simulations by considering 21 values of @xmath50 from 0.1 to 10 , sampled evenly on a logarithmic scale .",
    "we use the observed optical luminosity as @xmath51 and keep redshift unchanged .",
    "then @xmath22 , @xmath23 and fluxes can be determined using equations ( 3)-(5 ) .",
    "the x - ray flux limit is determined as follows .",

    "the average rest - frame @xmath5 flux for one count in 0.5 - 2 kev of the six quasars is @xmath54 erg @xmath55 s@xmath15 hz@xmath15 .",
    "so we simply put a flux limit of @xmath56 erg @xmath55 s@xmath15 hz@xmath15 .",
    "we assume that simulated quasars with @xmath53 and @xmath57 less than @xmath58 will not be detected : quasars with @xmath59 will be assigned zero count , and quasars with @xmath60 will be assigned 1 count .",
    "then the upper limits of non - detected quasars are at the 95% confidence level and will be calculated according to kraft et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , assuming one count corresponds to a flux of @xmath61 erg @xmath55 s@xmath15 .    then we simulate 100 samples for each of 21 different @xmath50 values .",
    "for each @xmath50 , we compute the average slopes and spearman correlation coefficients @xmath62 from the 100 simulated samples and display the results in figures 2 and 3 . parameters for simulated samples are calculated in the same way as for panels ( a ) and ( c ) in figure 1 . as discussed in strateva et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the measurement errors and variability effects bring @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and @xmath65 . the observed dispersion is 0.4 for the m06 sample and around @xmath66 for other samples .",
    "the extra dispersions could be assigned to either @xmath46 or @xmath45 as unknown dispersions , so the possible range of @xmath50 should be @xmath67 , i.e. @xmath68 . in the range of @xmath69 ,",
    "@xmath62 and slopes in simulated samples for both @xmath25 and @xmath70 correlations are consistent with observed values within 1.5@xmath71 , as shown in figures 2 and 3 .     as a measure of the @xmath72 and @xmath73 correlation for miyaji s sample and simulated samples .",

    "symbols and lines are as in figure 2.,width=317 ]    from the above two analyses , we conclude that a constant @xmath0 which does not depend on optical luminosity is still consistent with data in this high - z sample .",
    "yuan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) pointed out that a dispersion larger for the optical luminosity than for the x - ray luminosity tends to result in apparent , yet artificial correlation of @xmath1 .",
    "to quantitatively examine the effect of dispersions on the artificial correlation , we make a simple analytic calculation as follows .    as shown in figure 4 , assuming @xmath74 , dispersions in @xmath23 and @xmath22 are @xmath46 and @xmath45 , respectively , and the span range of @xmath22 is @xmath75",
    ". then locations of agns in the @xmath1 plane with average @xmath23 and @xmath76 range of @xmath22 are indicated by the dotted lines in the lower panel , where an apparent correlation appears .",
    "we only consider the simplest situation :    1 .",

    "agns are only distributed @xmath77 away from @xmath78 , i.e. @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is an unknown positive coefficient to be determined .",
    "we will discuss the value of @xmath80 later .",
    "then we fit the observed agns in the @xmath1 plane , assuming a least chi - squared fitting procedure with same weight in @xmath22 and @xmath45 ( i.e. @xmath81 ) as @xmath82/ \\sigma_c^2,\\ ] ] where the @xmath83 and @xmath84 are observed values , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the values in the fitting line ( indicated by a long solid line with a negative slope in the lower panel of figure 4 ) with the least @xmath87 , and @xmath88 is the typical constant error of @xmath22 . then @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the slope of the fitting line .",
    "the best fit slope @xmath90 can be derived by solving @xmath91 the solution is @xmath92 @xmath93    the deviation of the approximation in equation ( 10 ) from equation ( 9 ) is less than @xmath94 when @xmath95 . considering two sub - samples with the same weight and different slopes @xmath96 and",
    "@xmath97 respectively , the slope of combined sample including all points in each sub - samples would be @xmath98 , where the last @xmath99 is valid only if @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , we can derive the slope of the combined sample considering different @xmath80 values with different weights by an integration @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the probability of @xmath80 .",
    "then we take the distribution of @xmath80 into account .",
    "if @xmath104 , and @xmath45 follows gaussian distribution , the probability of @xmath80 would be @xmath105 then @xmath106    equation ( 13 ) shows that the slope of the artificial @xmath72 correlation is directly proportional to @xmath107 .",
    "the significance of the correlation , which could be measured by spearman correlation coefficient , is always positively correlated to the slope value in the artificial @xmath72 correlation , as shown in figures 2 - 3 .",
    "therefore , the result in equation ( 13 ) also means the significance of the artificial @xmath72 correlation is proportional to @xmath107 .    for the m06 sample , @xmath108 and @xmath109",

    "such estimation of an artificial slope using equations ( 13 ) or ( 14 ) is qualitatively consistent with the slope in the @xmath35 simulations , where the value is @xmath111 as shown in figure 3 .",
    "a reason for the discrepancy is that the absolute slope value is not @xmath112 , therefore approximations used in our estimation are deviated from true values .",
    "another possible reason , i.e. different fitting procedure used in simulations and our estimation , would more or less contribute to the lower absolute slope values in simulations . in simulations , a linear regression method , which only takes residuals of the dependent variable into account , is used , thus always leading to a lower absolute slope value than methods considering residuals in both variables as used in equation ( 7 ) , as shown in panel ( b ) in figure 1 .     and",
    "@xmath72 relationship . here",
    "@xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "see section 2.2 for details.,width=317 ]    we now discuss consequences of non - zero @xmath46 . when @xmath115 , the distribution of @xmath80 will be extended . as shown in figure 4 ,",
    "point b becomes a distribution in the range of cd within @xmath76 .",
    "when calculating the @xmath116 of a linear regression with slope @xmath117 , the contribution of the broadening in b is equivalent to an extension along the @xmath22 axis .",
    "for example , as shown in figure 4 , the contribution of point c is equivalent to point c which has the same @xmath0 as b but smaller @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , a non - zero @xmath46 tends to smooth the distribution of @xmath22 and extend its range .",
    "when @xmath118 is comparable with @xmath22 , it will extend the range of @xmath22 significantly . to show this effect , we do another simulation . based on the m06 sample with a given @xmath119 , we calculate the spearman correlation coefficients and slope for @xmath1 correlation with different @xmath46 , while other conditions are set to be the same as simulations in section 2.1 . as shown in figure 5 , when @xmath120 , i.e. @xmath121 and @xmath122 , both the spearman correlation coefficient and the slope tend to move toward zero when @xmath46 increases . when @xmath123 , i.e. @xmath124 and @xmath125 , there is no correlation in @xmath1 within @xmath76 .",
    "however , as discussed in section 2.1 , even if all extra dispersion in @xmath0 comes from @xmath23 , @xmath46 is unlikely to exceed 0.4 and @xmath126 is unlikely to exceed @xmath127 .",
    "the effects of @xmath45 on the relationship of @xmath25 is similar with the effects of @xmath46 on the relationship of @xmath1 .",
    "thus we do not need to repeat the above analysis .",
    "moreover , a similar effect as presented here for the @xmath1 correlation would also affect any correlation with a dependent variable @xmath128 , which is not directly observed but derived from @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the independent variable , such as the baldwin effect , which has also been pointed out by yuan et al .",
    "( 1998 )    in summary , the significance of artificial correlation in @xmath1 is approximately proportional to @xmath107 , and decreases when @xmath46 increases and becomes comparable with @xmath131 , where @xmath90 is the absolute value of the artificial slope and @xmath75 is the range @xmath22 span .     and best - fit slopes of the @xmath72 correlation for simulated samples for various @xmath46 , with constant @xmath119 and @xmath132 .",
    "@xmath22 and redshift distributions are from miyaji et al .",
    "( 2006).,width=317 ]",
    "another problem in the study of @xmath1 relationship is the degeneracy between redshift and luminosity in flux - limited samples .",
    "s06 used a much larger sample than m06 with @xmath133 , which suppresses the false slope artifacts discussed in section 2 . the observed change in @xmath0 across this larger baseline @xmath134 in their sample",
    "is sufficiently large that @xmath0 must depend on luminosity , or redshift , or both . to distinguish between luminosity dependence and redshift dependence , first ,",
    "s06 performed partial correlation analysis using kendall s generalized partial @xmath135 to quantitatively show the correlation significance of @xmath1 and @xmath136 .",
    "they found a 13.6@xmath71 correlation of @xmath1 when controlling @xmath137 , and a 1.3@xmath71 correlation of @xmath136 when controlling @xmath22 .",
    "however , kelley et al . ( 2007 ) has showed that interpretation of kendall s @xmath135 is problematic , and kendall s @xmath135 for the @xmath136 correlation is not necessarily expected to be non - zero when @xmath0 is correlated with @xmath137 . based on simulations , kelley et al .",
    "( 2007 ) pointed out that the lack of evidence for a significant correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath137 based on kendall s @xmath135 in steffen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) may be the result of an incorrect assumption about the distribution of @xmath135 under the null hypothesis . in spite of most previous studies , kelley et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that @xmath0 is correlated with both @xmath22 and @xmath137 .",
    "moreover , in the partial correlation analysis of @xmath1 , consequences of luminosity dispersions , as discussed in section 2 , were not taken into account . to show this effect , we select agns in three redshift bins , with each bin containing 38 sources , to control the redshift .",
    "then we examine the @xmath1 and @xmath25 relations in each bin , as shown in figures 6 and 7 .",
    "similar to figure 1 , in each redshift bin , @xmath0 is anti - correlated with @xmath22 , but positively correlated with @xmath23 , which is caused by luminosity dispersions . because dispersions always strengthen the anti - correlation of @xmath1 , dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath22 might be biased toward higher significance by luminosity dispersions , whereas the dependence on @xmath137 does not suffer such bias .",
    "second , s06 compared @xmath0 residuals as a linear function of @xmath22 and @xmath137 . as shown in their figure  8 ,",
    "there are systematic residuals of @xmath138 , which indicate that @xmath0 can not be linearly dependent on redshift alone .",
    "however , spectral index might depend on redshift in a non - linear form , as shown in figure 12 of strateva et al .",

    "therefore , the results here can be applied to x - ray selected sample with similar flux limits after switching @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "second , x - ray lfs have larger errors than optical lfs due to smaller samples .",
    "therefore , it is our purpose to just point out the fact that the slope will be biased in flux limited x - ray samples , rather than focusing on a particular x - ray selected sample .    while a number of previous studies of optical selected agns have reported that @xmath0 is anti - correlated with luminosity ( e.g. strateva et al . 2005 ; steffen et al .",
    "2006 ) , whether @xmath0 depends on luminosity in x - ray selected agn samples remains unknown .",
    "hasinger ( 2004 ) found no @xmath0 dependence on either luminosity or redshift in soft x - ray selected samples .",

    "they also found the slope decreases when only brighter sources are included , and the slope increases when only fainter sources are included .",
    "it is possible that the slope might be biased in this flux limited sample and the magnitude of biases are different when using different flux limit . as shown in figure  11 , if @xmath204 , an optically selected sample like in s06 will be biased toward a flatter slope .",
    "moreover , if the x - ray lf is similar to optical lf and the x - ray sample is consisted of agns with similar flux limits , the x - ray sample will be biased toward a steeper slope .",
    "therefore , even if optically selected agns and x - ray selected agns are identical , the slope in the optically selected sample will be flatter than the slope in the x - ray selected sample , which can properly explain the observed discrepancy .    in summary , selection effects in flux limited samples might bias the @xmath162 relation and cause discrepancy in the @xmath162 relation in optically selected samples and x - ray selected samples , especially when @xmath197 or @xmath198 change in cosmic time .",
    "the magnitude of the bias and discrepancy depend on the luminosity function , flux limits of the sample , and dispersions in optical and x - ray luminosities .",
    "note that even if such selection effects do bias the slope of the @xmath162 relation toward the observed discrepancy between optical and x - ray samples , it is not necessarily the only reason .",
    "it is possible that optically selected samples and x - ray selected samples are consisted of different agns , so slopes of the @xmath162 relation in optically selected samples will be different from slopes in x - ray selected ones .",
    "as discussed in brusa et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , about @xmath205 of the x - ray selected agns in their cosmos sample would have not been easily selected as agn candidates on the basis of purely optical criteria , either because similar colors to dwarf stars or field galaxies , or because they are not point like sources in morphological classification . moreover ,",
    "optically selected agns and x - ray selected agns might be typically in different evolution stages and thus are not identical ( shen et al .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the correlation between the spectral index @xmath0 and optical / x - ray luminosities in agns by means of linear regressions , monte carlo simulations , simplified analytic estimations and comparison of x - ray and optical luminosity functions .",

    "the dependence of @xmath0 on optical luminosity found in miyaji et al .",
    "( 2006 ) may not be an underlying physical property .",
    "it remains unknown whether @xmath30 or @xmath31 if @xmath8 in this high - z sample .",
    "the luminosity dependence can be artificially generated very easily by luminosity dispersions .",
    "the significance of artificial correlation in @xmath1 is approximately proportional to @xmath107 , where @xmath45 is the optical luminosity dispersion and @xmath75 is the range that @xmath22 spans , and decreases when @xmath46 increases and becomes comparable with @xmath131 , where @xmath90 is the absolute value of the artificial slope .",
    "this effect also affects the baldwin effect . instead of regressions only weighting one variable , weighting both @xmath22 and @xmath23 , i.e. ils bisector , in the regression",
    "would be a more robust methodology to avoid such bias .",
    "\\3 . in a more complete low - z sub - sample from steffen",
    "et al . ( 2006 ) , @xmath0 must depend on luminosity , or redshift , or both .",
    "however , a luminosity independent @xmath0 is still consistent with data .",
    "redshift dependencies can not be ruled out and may be large , but somewhat hidden because of luminosity dispersions , which generate artificial luminosity correlations in each redshift bin .",
    "\\4 . in the comparison of x - ray ( barger et al . 2005 ) and optical quasar ( richards et al .",
    "2006 ) lfs , a luminosity independent @xmath0 is consistent with data , and more preferred than the luminosity dependent @xmath0 model given by s06 .",
    "selection effects in flux limited samples might bias the @xmath206 relation and cause discrepancy in the @xmath162 relation in optically selected sample and x - ray selected sample , especially when @xmath197 or @xmath198 change in cosmic time .",
    "the magnitude of the bias depends on the luminosity function , flux limits of the sample , and dispersions in optical and x - ray luminosities .",
    "it therefore remains inconclusive whether the anti - correlation between agn spectral index and optical luminosity is true .",
    "even if @xmath0 does depend on optical luminosity , the currently adopted slope value might be biased and deviate from the intrinsic value . to correctly establish a dependence of @xmath0 of agns on their luminosity , a larger and more complete sample , such as from multi - wavelength surveys , is needed and consequences of luminosity dispersions and selection effects in flux limited samples must be taken into account properly .",
