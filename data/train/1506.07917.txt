    "the scope of this review is limited to the experimental prospects for measuring the unknown sign of the atmospheric mass splitting or , equivalently , whether @xmath0 is the heaviest or lightest mass eigenstate .",
    "these two possibilities are termed , respectively , the normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies , and figure  [ fig : hier ] shows the two cases graphically .",
    "some authors prefer the term `` mass ordering '' over `` mass hierarchy '' when a third case  a degenerate spectrum ",
    "is relevant to the context . in a degenerate spectrum ,",
    "the mass of the lightest neutrino is large compared to the individual mass differences , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath29 . of note ,",
    "neutrinoless double beta decay rates depend strongly on the mass hierarchy only if the mass spectrum is non - degenerate  @xcite . in more general contexts ,",
    "authors regularly use `` ordering '' and `` hierarchy '' interchangeably .",
    "the precision of neutrino sector measurements has reached a point where the unknown hierarchy is a major hurdle to further progress .",
    "knowledge of the hierarchy is also vital to interpretation of neutrinoless double beta decay results , serves as an input to cosmological and astrophysical measurements , and is a powerful discriminant among unification and neutrino mass models .",
    "the neutrino mass hierarchy may also be the next major unknown of the standard model to be measured . in this article",
    "we review the experimental outlook for making this measurement .",
    "is known through observations of solar neutrinos , which are subject to resonant matter effects in the sun  @xcite . ]",
    "several distinct approaches for probing the mass hierarchy are in use or under consideration by current and future experiments .",
    "one approach is motivated by the vacuum oscillation probability in eq .",
    "( [ equ : oscprob ] ) . since this probability depends on each of the mass splittings @xmath30 , a sufficiently precise measurement of @xmath31 for a given set of initial and final flavors @xmath11 and @xmath12 can determine whether @xmath23 is slightly larger or smaller than @xmath32 .",
    "this approach suits reactor - sourced @xmath33 oscillation measurements , as low energy neutrinos ( few mev ) are needed to obtain significant contributions from the @xmath22 terms at distances @xmath13 that are short enough ( tens of kilometers ) to still have useful event rates at the detector .    for neutrinos",
    "traveling through matter , the presence of electrons in the propagation medium modifies the hamiltonian for @xmath1 differently than it does for @xmath2 and @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , the effective masses of the @xmath1-dominated @xmath4 and @xmath5 states are increased ( or decreased for antineutrinos ) by the presence of the electrons , and the kinematic phases @xmath34 follow suit .",
    "this either compresses or expands the effective mass splittings , depending on the hierarchy , modifying the oscillation probabilities in a observable way .    in a different arena ,",
    "cosmological measurements of large - scale structure , the cosmic microwave background , and its @xmath35-mode polarization provide access to the hierarchy via the sum of the neutrino masses  @xcite . in particular , were these data to yield @xmath36 , the hierarchy would have to be normal .",
    "a analogous constraint can be made for the effective electron neutrino mass measured in beta decay experiments , but upcoming experiments will not have the mass sensitivity required to provide hierarchy information even if the necessary conditions on the mass spectrum ( normal hierarchy and small @xmath37 ) are met .    neutrinoless double beta decay searches will rely on external knowledge of the hierarchy to interpret observed ( or limited ) decay rates  @xcite and will not provide independent measurements of the hierarchy themselves .",
    "likewise , the neutrino fluxes from supernovae carry signatures of the hierarchy due to both matter effects and collective ( high neutrino density ) effects  @xcite , but uncertainties in the astrophysical models make reliable determination of the hierarchy through supernova neutrino observations unlikely even if a nearby supernova event were to occur in the near future .    in the sections below ,",
    "we describe specific experimental efforts toward measuring the mass hierarchy , discussing the advantages , possible pitfalls , and expected sensitivity of each .",
    "the collection is not exhaustive in that we exclude experiments that do not have notable hierarchy sensitivity or are unlikely to proceed due to programmatic , budgetary , or other practical considerations .",
    "first , it is worth devoting a few words to the statistical interpretation of the sensitivities . though the question at hand can be stated quite simply  is the hierarchy normal or inverted ?",
    " much discussion of its statistical treatment has taken place in recent years , largely due to the lack of a universally accepted definition of sensitivity .",
    "three definitions appear most often in the literature .",
    "the first makes use of pseudo - data formed from the predictions for the experimental observables .",
    "more specifically , one of the hierarchies is taken as truth and the corresponding predicted observables are used directly as the pseudo - data , with no statistical or systematic fluctuations introduced .",
    "this data set , for which the name `` asimov '' data set  @xcite is gaining traction in the literature , is then fit assuming the opposite hierarchy to find the minimum @xmath38 for this wrong hierarchy assumption , marginalizing over all free oscillation and systematic nuisance parameters .",
    "since the correct assumption must produce @xmath39 for this data set , the minimum @xmath38 found for the wrong hierarchy represents a typical @xmath40 between the hypotheses .",
    "motivated by the behavior of gaussian systems , @xmath41 is then taken as the hierarchy determination sensitivity as a number of @xmath42 .    in a second approach ,",
    "an ensemble of fully fluctuated data sets is simulated assuming one hierarchy and used to calculate the expectation value for the @xmath43 between the incorrect and correct hierarchy hypotheses , again marginalizing over nuisance parameters for each simulated data set .",
    "the sensitivity is then quoted as @xmath44 .",
    "the third common approach starts again with an ensemble of fluctuated data sets assuming one hierarchy .",
    "the sensitivity is quoted as the frequency with which the correct hierarchy hypothesis fits to a lower @xmath38 than the incorrect one .",
    "this sensitivity may be given as a @xmath45-value directly or converted into the corresponding number of gaussian @xmath42 .",
    "many variants of these approaches have also been used or proposed .",
    "a given author may choose one method over another to facilitate comparisons or combinations with past research , to promote a bayesian or frequentist philosophy to reporting results , to make calculations simpler or computationally faster , or to ensure statistical accuracy .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite serve as further introduction to these issues .",
    "we take a pragmatic view here , noting that on the whole these concerns tend not to lead to actionable differences in sensitivity estimates .",
    "these differences are quantified within the frequentist realm in  @xcite . since frequentist and bayesian techniques",
    "answer fundamentally different questions , cross - comparisons between them are more fraught , especially at low sensitivities . nevertheless , the primary concerns that arise when examining sensitivity projections are rarely these fraction - of - a-@xmath42 effects but rather the broader issues of engineering or detector performance requirements , the treatment of systematic uncertainties , the realism of stated timelines , or the prospects for obtaining funding for the desired experimental scope .",
    "another popular statistical question surrounding the mass hierarchy is :  with what confidence must we establish it ?",
    "in practice , each increment in hierarchy sensitivity adds importantly to our understanding .",
    "even a @xmath46 measurement would begin guiding the model - building community and would become a meaningful input in other areas of physics ( _ e.g. _ ,  cosmology and astrophysics ) .",
    "as the hierarchy significance increases , so too does the significance of any measurement that takes the hierarchy as input .",
    "thus , while a @xmath47 hierarchy measurement will be a historic milestone for particle physics , a continued push to @xmath48 or beyond is needed if we are to make @xmath49 claims for other , quantitatively related questions ( _ e.g. _ ,  exclusion of majorana neutrinos due to future non - observation of neutrinoless double beta decay ) . whether those subsequent questions require high levels of significance is beyond the scope of this article .",
    "long - baseline neutrino experiments use accelerator - based sources of @xmath2 or @xmath50 and large detectors some hundreds of kilometers downstream to investigate neutrino oscillations . these experiments probe the mass hierarchy through the matter effects that modify the appearance probability @xmath51 and its antineutrino counterpart from their vacuum values . neglecting higher - order terms in @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the @xmath54 transition probability for long - baseline experiments is given by  @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and the plus ( minus ) signs apply to neutrino ( antineutrino ) oscillations . in the definition of @xmath59 , @xmath60 is the weak coupling constant and @xmath61 is the number density of electrons in the propagation medium .",
    "the mass hierarchy enters via the @xmath62 factors in eq .",
    "( [ equ : numunuematter ] ) , with @xmath59 switching signs between the normal and inverted cases . to increase the scale of this perturbation",
    ", one must increase the neutrino energy @xmath15 .",
    "however , one must also stay near the oscillation maximum of @xmath63 to have significant oscillation probability at all .",
    "thus , the experimental baseline @xmath13 must also increase , leading to the practical fact that an increased sensitivity to the mass hierarchy in the @xmath1 and @xmath64 appearance channels comes from having a longer experimental baseline .",
    "figure  [ fig : biprob ] shows how the appearance probability changes over the three baselines discussed here :  295  km ( t2k ) , 810  km ( no@xmath65a ) , and 1300  km ( dune ) .",
    "the probabilities are plotted for all possible values of the _ cp_-violating phase @xmath66 , tracing out ellipses in the figure .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath66 complicates the mass hierarchy measurement , although less so at the longest baselines since the hierarchy - dependent matter effects become larger than any possible @xmath66-induced changes in the oscillation probabilities .",
    "hierarchy sensitivities for long - baseline experiments are often quoted as a function of the true ( if unknown ) @xmath66 .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath27 is the next largest factor after @xmath66 , with the current allowed range of @xmath27 leading to a peak sensitivity uncertainty of roughly @xmath67% .",
    "this dependence is not always explicit in experiments official sensitivity plots , which often assume a fixed typical value for @xmath27 , say @xmath68 .",
    "t2k and no@xmath65a are currently operational , and dune is a planned future experiment . several concepts for a future long - baseline experiment , some with impressive hierarchy sensitivity , have been studied and pursued in recent years .",
    "however , most of these have remained virtual given the need for significant funding ( approximately us$1b ) and a firm programmatic commitment from a suitable facility .",
    "today , two efforts have significant momentum .",
    "one is dune , a newly formed international collaboration that , in practice , merges several previously independent efforts .",
    "the other , hyper - k , is discussed in section  [ sec : atmos ] .     versus @xmath69 for both hierarchies ( red and blue ellipses ) and for the full range of @xmath66 ( cycling around the ellipses ) for a representative @xmath70 value of @xmath71 . at the t2k baseline ,",

    "the sensitivities for pingu and orca quoted above take conservative values of @xmath96 . for @xmath95 , pingu can reach @xmath47 sensitivity within its first year of operation and @xmath94 after four years .      the ical detector at the india - based neutrino observatory ( ical@ino )  @xcite is a planned 50-kton magnetized tracker made of 150 alternating layers of iron and resistive plate chambers .",
    "the 1.5-t magnetic field provides excellent @xmath97 separation , and consequently @xmath98 separation , on an event - by - event basis .",
    "this advantage , together with the detector s excellent energy and angular resolution , mitigates to some degree the lower event rates due to ical s small fiducial mass .",
    "the ical hierarchy sensitivity after ten years of operation ranges from @xmath99 to @xmath100 depending on the true value of @xmath27 .",
    "ical@ino is moving ahead with support from india , and site work has begun .",
    "operations are projected to begin in 2018 , although given the required civil construction that date is likely optimistic .",
    "the detector technology is well - established and should not present problems scaling up to 50 kton .",
    "continuing detector r&d is focused on performance and longevity optimization  @xcite .",
    "one concern is that the sensitivity is somewhat low compared with that of other experiments proposing results on a similar time frame ( _ c. _  2030 ) .",
    "in contrast to hyper - k , for which the atmospheric neutrino sample provides the bulk of the hierarchy sensitivity , dune s atmospheric measurement is secondary to its accelerator - based measurement ( section  [ sec : dune ] ) .",
    "a 340-kton - year atmospheric exposure yields @xmath101 sensitivity , depending on @xmath27 .",
    "this can be compared with the accelerator - based measurement that bottoms out at @xmath48 in the extreme worst case . however ,",
    "if the beam power of 1.2  mw is significantly delayed relative to the detector deployment , the dune atmospheric sample could play a role , especially because the detector s excellent energy and angular resolution make it particularly good for this application .      for the @xmath102 @xmath64 streaming from a nuclear reactor ,",
    "the first oscillation maximum for @xmath22-driven solar oscillations occurs at @xmath103 and for @xmath23-driven atmospheric oscillations at @xmath104 .",
    "kamland has successfully exploited the former to measure @xmath25 and @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "more recently daya bay , reno , and double chooz have exploited the latter to measure @xmath26 and the effective squared - mass splitting @xmath105  @xcite .    at the longer of these baselines ,",
    "the small amplitude and rapid ( with respect to @xmath15 ) atmospheric oscillation will be superimposed on a deeper and slower solar oscillation .",
    "the relative phase of these oscillation modes reveals the relative sizes of @xmath32 and @xmath23 .",
    "figure  [ fig : junoprobs ] demonstrates the principle of the measurement for a baseline of 50  km .",
    "the broad solar dip in the @xmath64 survival probability is visible together with the fast atmospheric oscillations , and flipping the sign of @xmath23 shifts the period and phase of these oscillations in an observable way .     as a function of neutrino energy for a fixed neutrino baseline of 50  km .",
    "the range of energies shown spans the relevant reactor @xmath64 flux .",
    "the wide dip centered at 3  mev is due to the dominant solar oscillation , and the wiggles correspond to the sub - dominant atmospheric oscillation .",
    "the two curves differ only in the assumed sign of @xmath23 ( and also in the magnitude of @xmath32 since the magnitudes of the other two splittings were held fixed . ) ]    leveraging this effect requires a large , low - background detector with unprecedented energy resolution . over the past decade ,",
    "the experimental requirements have been extensively explored  @xcite , leading today to two experimental proposals , juno and reno-50  @xcite .",
    "juno ( jiangmen underground neutrino observatory ) proposes a 20-kton liquid scintillator detector with @xmath106 energy resolution . for comparison , kamland used a 1-kton detector with an energy resolution of @xmath107  @xcite .",
    "the required advance in energy resolution is to come from increased photocathode coverage , higher - efficiency phototubes , and brighter yet more transparent scintillator .",
    "r&d on these fronts has led to encouraging progress , but significant work remains to demonstrate that this performance is achievable  @xcite .",
    "the pattern of the fast oscillations is also susceptible to systematic uncertainties .",
    "an error in the magnitude of @xmath23 or in the overall energy scale of the detector will skew the oscillation pattern in a similar , though not identical , way to flipping the hierarchy .",
    "energy non - linearities are more pernicious , and ref .",
    "@xcite derives a requirement of @xmath1080.5% variation in energy scale across the spectrum .",
    "this requirement can be relaxed to @xmath742% ( a performance demonstrated with the smaller kamland detector ) if the functional form of the non - linearity is known at some level  @xcite .",
    "juno is sited equidistant from two primary reactor sites , each with multiple cores .",
    "each core corresponds to a slightly different baseline , and the juno sensitivities take into account the resulting smearing of the oscillation pattern . with a 6-year run , juno projects a mass hierarchy sensitivity of 4@xmath42 , give or take 10% depending on the level of precision achieved by long - baseline experiments on the atmospheric mass splitting .",
    "juno has strong support from china and is moving ahead , with operations to start around 2020 .",
    "if the detector r&d does not lead to the performance metrics required , juno s hierarchy sensitivity could be considerably reduced .",
    "however , juno has an impressive precision oscillation physics program separate from the mass hierarchy measurement  @xcite .",
    "reno-50 is a similar proposal , based in korea , to use an 18-kton detector with performance requirements that are essentially identical to those of juno  @xcite .",
    "while sensitivities of @xmath47 have appeared in the literature  @xcite , the calculations are notably less detailed than those of juno ( _ e.g. _ ,  accounting for the smearing from multiple reactors ) .",
    "detector r&d funding for reno-50 has been established , but start of operations by 2020 as proposed by the experiment s proponents is likely optimistic .",
    "neutrinos in the early universe damped out density fluctuations on scales smaller than their free streaming length , which began decreasing as the neutrinos red - shifted toward non - relativistic energies .",
    "the masses of the neutrinos governed the timing of the non - relativistic transition .",
    "thus , these masses are imprinted on the matter power spectrum today .",
    "multiple experimental techniques are sensitive to this imprint , including cosmic microwave background anisotropy and @xmath35-mode polarization measurements , galaxy surveys , weak lensing , and the lyman-@xmath109 forest  @xcite .",
    "cosmological measurements are sensitive primarily to the sum of the neutrino masses , not the individual masses . the most powerful constraints on this sum naturally comes from combinations of data sets , and current upper limits fall at @xmath110  @xcite .",
    "upcoming terrestrial and space - based measurements that can improve on these limits include ms - desi , euclid , lsst , and a stage - iv cmb project .",
    "all of these projects are relatively likely to proceed , with timescales for start of operations ranging from 2018 to 2022 .",
    "the forecast uncertainties on @xmath111 begin at 20 mev ( _ c. _  2025 ) and improve to @xmath7410  mev ( _ c. _  2030 ) , with past data sets taken in combination with future ones  @xcite .    for the normal hierarchy",
    ", @xmath111 must be at least 0.06  ev given the oscillation measurements of eqs .",
    "( [ equ : solarsplit ] ) and ( [ equ : atmsplit ] ) . for the inverted hierarchy",
    ", @xmath111 must be at least 0.1  ev .",
    "thus if the hierarchy is normal and @xmath112 , the uncertainties given above for @xmath111 translate into @xmath46 sensitivity for determining the neutrino mass hierarchy by 2025 and @xmath113 a few years later .",
    "the requirements on the mass spectrum for this measurement are critical :  an inverted hierarchy or a smallest neutrino mass larger than @xmath740.04  ev eliminates entirely the hierarchy - determining power of cosmological observations .",
    "it is useful to summarize the experimental sensitivities given above in a time - ordered , rather than technique - ordered , manner .",
    "we skip here those options with underdeveloped estimates .    * _ today : _",
    "super - k ( atmospheric ) , minos ( atmospheric ) , and t2k ( accelerator ) have proof - of - principle results that constrain the mass hierarchy at an insignificant level .",
    "these sensitivities will not improve substantially with added exposure . * _ by 2020 : _",
    "no@xmath65a will have most of its planned data set and can make a statement at @xmath75 for favorable values of @xmath66 . for unfavorable values , no@xmath65a s hierarchy measurement will be correlated with its @xmath66 measurement , and an unambiguous hierarchy determination will not yet be possible . in these cases , combining with t2k will help marginally . * _ by 2025 : _",
    "pingu could provide @xmath114 sensitivity if the experiment is deployed in a timely manner .",
    "if the juno detectors perform as required , a partial juno exposure could provide @xmath75 sensitivity by this date . * _ by 2030 : _  some uncertain fraction ( @xmath11550% ) of dune s 340-kton - year exposure could be available , yielding sensitivities of @xmath116 . similarly , hyper - k could provide @xmath117 , and juno s sensitivity would reach its design @xmath113 .",
    "input from cosmology would be firmly in hand .",
    "ical could reach @xmath47 by this time .",
    "* _ by 2035 : _  if dune proceeds in a timely manner , a large fraction of its full exposure would be available , and the hierarchy would be definitively established at @xmath118 .",
    "hyper - k would be at or beyond its design @xmath114 .    given the complementarity of the various techniques , it is natural to explore combined sensitivities , and the literature contains a near - exhaustive set of combinations .",
    "the no@xmath65a and t2k combination is discussed in section  [ sec : lbl ] , above .",
    "atmospheric and reactor experiments offer a particularly interesting synergy , as fits to the wrong hierarchy introduce different pulls on @xmath23 between the two techniques .",
    "the pingu@xmath119juno case is explored in ref .",
    "@xcite .    setting aside the potential sensitivity boosts via combinations",
    ", however , it is critical to measure the hierarchy through independent techniques , not only for the added confidence in the results but also as protection against unfavorable parameters of nature . to wit , atmospheric sensitivities are largely independent of @xmath66 , in contrast to accelerator sensitivities .",
    "reactor sensitivities are invariant with respect to @xmath27 , in contrast to atmospheric sensitivities .",
    "cosmological measurements are entirely free of dependence on oscillation parameters but do require a very particular mass spectrum .",
    "table  [ tab : summary ] summarizes the experimental situation and the prospects for determining the neutrino mass hierarchy in the coming years .",
    "the table lists the most critical concerns , some of which are major .",
    "however , if even just a couple of the promising experimental options becomes reality without delay , the outlook can be succinctly stated :  a statistically significant ( @xmath12095% cl )  hierarchy determination is possible , but not guaranteed , by 2020 ; a statistically significant determination is likely by the late 2020s ; and a definitive ( @xmath118 ) measurement is possible by the late 2020s and likely by the early 2030s .",
    ".prospects for measuring the neutrino mass hierarchy in the coming years .",
