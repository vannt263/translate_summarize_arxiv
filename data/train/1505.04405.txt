    "nearly three decades after their discovery @xcite , the high - temperature cuprate superconductors have so far eluded a comprehensive explanation .",
    "these layered materials contain cuo@xmath4 layers , which are antiferromagnetic insulators in the undoped limit and become superconducting upon doping @xcite .",
    "the hole - doped side shows a more robust superconductivity , extending to higher temperatures and over a wider range of dopings . the first step towards deciphering the mechanism of superconductivity in these compounds is a proper description of the motion of these holes in the cuo@xmath4 layer",
    " this has become one of the most studied problems in condensed matter theory @xcite .",
    "its solution should elucidate the nature of the quasiparticles that eventually bind together into the pairs that facilitate the superconducting state .    despite significant effort ,",
    "even what is the minimal model that correctly describes this low - energy quasiparticle is still not clear .",
    "there is general agreement that the parent compounds are charge - transfer insulators @xcite , and wide consensus that most of their low - energy physics is revealed by studies of a single cuo@xmath4 layer , modeled in terms of cu @xmath5 and o @xmath6 orbitals .",
    "because only ligand @xmath6 orbitals hybridize with the @xmath5 orbitals , it is customary to ignore the other o @xmath6 orbitals ; this leads to the well - known three - band emery model @xcite .",
    "however , the emery model is perceived as too complicated to study so it is often further simplified to a one - band @xmath0-@xmath1 model that describes the dynamics of a zhang - rice singlet ( zrs ) @xcite .",
    "we known that the @xmath0-@xmath1 model with only nearest - neighbor ( nn ) hopping @xmath0 is certainly not the correct model because it predicts a nearly flat quasiparticle energy along @xmath7 , unlike the substantial dispersion found experimentally @xcite .",
    "however , its extension with longer range hopping , the @xmath0-@xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath1 model , was shown to reproduce the correct dispersion @xcite for values of the 2@xmath8 and 3@xmath9 nn hoppings in rough agreement with those estimated from density functional theory @xcite and cluster calculations @xcite . taking this agreement as proof that this is the correct model , both the @xmath0-@xmath1 model and its parent , the hubbard model @xcite ,",
    "have been studied very extensively in the context of cuprate physics .    here",
    "we show that the quasiparticle of the @xmath0-@xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath1 model is _ qualitatively _ different from that of the @xmath10 limit of the three - band emery model @xcite .",
    "while both models predict a dispersion in quantitative agreement with that measured experimentally ( for suitable values of the parameters ) , the factors controlling the quasiparticle dynamics are very different .",
    "it has long been known that both the longer - range hopping and the spin fluctuations play a key role in the dynamics of the quasiparticle of the @xmath0-@xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath1 model .",
    "here we use a non - perturbative variational method , which agrees well with available exact diagonalization ( ed ) results , to show that spin - fluctuations and longer - range hopping control the quasiparticle dispersion in different parts of the brillouin zone , and to explain why .",
    "in contrast , using the same variational approach , it was recently argued that spin fluctuations play no role in the dispersion of the quasiparticle of the @xmath11 limit of the emery model @xcite .",
    "this claim is supported by additional results we present here .",
    "this major difference in the role played by spin fluctuations in determining the quasiparticle dynamics shows that these models do not describe the same physics .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath0-@xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath1 model is not suitable for the study of cuprates in the hole - doped regime , although it and related one - band models may be valid in the electron - doped regime .",
    "as we argue below , it may be possible to `` fix '' one - band models by addition of other terms , although we do not expect this to be a fruitful enterprise . instead , we believe that what is needed is a concerted effort to understand the predictions of the emery model . our results in ref .",
    "@xcite and here that spin fluctuations of the afm background do not play a key role in the quasiparticle dynamics of this three - band model , contrary to what was believed to be the case based on results from one - band models , should simplify this task .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the three - band emery model and briefly discuss the emergence of the one - band and simplified three - band models in the asymptotic limit of strong correlations on the cu sites . section",
    "iii describes the variational method , which consists in keeping a limited number of allowed magnon configurations in the quasiparticle cloud .",
    "section iv presents our results for both one- and three - band models , and their interpretation .",
    "finally , section v contains a summary and a detailed discussion of the implications of these results .",
    "a widely accepted starting point for the description of a cuo@xmath4 layer is the three - band emery model @xcite : @xmath12 the sets @xmath13 and @xmath14 contain the ligand o @xmath6 and the cu @xmath5 orbitals respectively , sketched in fig .",

    "@xmath21 is the kinetic energy of the holes moving on the o sublattice , described by a hamiltonian with first ( @xmath22 ) and second ( @xmath23 ) nearest - neighbour ( nn ) hopping : @xmath24 the lattice constant is set to @xmath25 .",
    "the vectors @xmath26 are the distances between any o and its four nn o sites , and @xmath27 sets the sign of each nn @xmath28 hopping integral in accordance with the overlap of the @xmath6 orbitals involved , see fig . [",
    "fig1](a ) .",
    "next nn hopping is included only between o @xmath6 orbitals pointing toward a common bridging cu , separated by @xmath29 or @xmath30 ; hybridization with the @xmath31 orbital of the bridging cu further boosts the value of this hopping integral .",

    "cu sites host spin degrees of freedom but the doped holes ( red filled square ) move on the o lattice .",
    "the arrows indicate the various terms in this hamiltonian ; ( d ) the full brillouin zone of the cuo@xmath4 lattice ( the outer square ) which encloses the magnetic brillouin zone ( shaded ) . ]",
    "@xmath33 is the kinetic energy of holes moving between neighbour cu and o orbitals : @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the distances between a cu and its four nn o sites , and @xmath36 are the signs of the overlaps of the corresponding orbitals .",
    "it is this term that provides the main justification for ignoring the other sets of @xmath6 orbitals , because symmetry forbids hopping of cu holes from @xmath5 orbitals into the non - ligand o orbitals .",
    "we further discuss this assumption below .",
    "@xmath37 is the charge transfer energy which ensures that in the parent compound the o @xmath6 orbitals are fully occupied ( _ i.e. _ contain no holes ) .",
    "finally , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the hubbard repulsion in the @xmath6 and @xmath18 orbitals , respectively .",
    "longer range coulomb interaction between holes on o and cu can also be added , but for the single doped - hole problem analyzed here , it leads to a trivial energy shift .",
    "strong correlations due to the large @xmath39 , combined with the big hilbert space with its three - orbitals basis , and the need for a solution for a hole concentration equal ( in the parent compound ) or larger ( in the hole doped case ) than one per cu , make this problem very difficult to solve . while progress is been made with a variety of techniques @xcite ( which however have various restrictions , such as rather high - temperatures and/or small clusters for quantum monte carlo methods , and/or additional approximations , such as setting @xmath40 for convenience ) , it is far more customary to further simplify this model before attempting a solution .",
    "a reasonable way forward is to use the limit @xmath10 to forbid double occupancy of the @xmath18 orbitals . as a result ,",
    "in the undoped ground - state there is one hole per cu .",
    "virtual hopping processes lead to antiferromagnetic ( afm ) superexchange between the resulting spin degrees of freedom , so that the parent compound is a mott insulator with long - range afm order @xcite .    upon doping ,",
    "holes enter the o band and the issue is how to accurately describe their dynamics as they interact with the spins at the cu sites .",
    "here we compare two such descriptions for _ the single doped hole case_.      in their seminal work @xcite , zhang and rice argued that the doped hole occupies the linear combination of the four @xmath41 2p ligand orbitals surrounding a central cu , that has the same @xmath42 symmetry like the cu @xmath18 orbital hosting the spin .",
    "furthermore , exchange locks the two holes in a low - energy zhang - rice singlet ( zrs ) .",
    "they also argued that the dynamics of this composite object , which combines charge and spin degrees of freedom , is well captured by the one - band model : @xmath43{\\cal    p}+ \\mathcal{h}_\\mathrm{afm}.\\ ] ] the first term describes the hopping of the zrs ( marked in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) by the `` missing spin '' locked in the zrs ) on the square lattice of cu sites that hosts it .",
    "originally only nn hopping @xmath44 was included : @xmath45 , with @xmath46 .",
    "the projector @xmath47 removes doubly occupied states , therefore this term allows only cu spins neighboring the zrs to exchange their location with the zrs .",
    "this mimics the more complex reality of the doped hole moving on the o sublattice and forming zrs with different cu spins .    although in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued that only nn zrs hoping is important , longer - range 2nd ( @xmath48 ) and 3rd ( @xmath49 ) nn hopping was later added the model on a rather ad - hoc basis . as discussed below ,",
    "this is needed in order to find a quasiparticle dispersion similar to that measured experimentally .",
    "these terms are defined similarly to @xmath50 with hopping integrals @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . for cuprates ,",
    "@xmath51 are considered to be representative values @xcite , in agreement with various estimates @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we refer to this as the @xmath0-@xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath1 model , whereas if @xmath52 we call it the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "the term @xmath53 describes the nn afm superexchange between the other cu spins @xmath54 , with @xmath55 for cuprates @xcite .",
    "it leads to afm order in the undoped system @xcite , and also controls the energy of the cloud of magnons that are created in the vicinity of the zrs , as it moves through the magnetic background .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 model also emerges as the @xmath56 limit of the hubbard model @xcite , but with additional terms of order @xmath1 .",
    "one of them , @xmath57 , gives trivial energy shifts for both the undoped and the single - hole doped cases of interest to us in this work , so its presence can be safely ignored in this context .",
    "more interesting is the so - called three - site term @xmath58 @xcite , where @xmath59 describes zrs hopping through an intermediate cu site and permits spin swapping with the spin at this intermediate site .",
    "as shown below , this term influences the quasiparticle dispersion but it is not clear that it should be included in the one - band model , because the original hamiltonian is the emery , not the hubbard , model .",
    "in fact , a perturbational derivation of the low - energy hamiltonian obtained by projecting the three - band model onto zrs states reveals a much more complicated hamiltonian than the @xmath0-@xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath1 model , with many other terms @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of a systematic study of their impacts , but their presence underlies one important issue with this approach : the hoped - for simplification due to the significant decrease in the size of the hilbert space comes at the expense of a hamiltonian whose full expression @xcite is very complicated . using instead simpler versions like the @xmath0-@xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath1 model may result in qualitatively different physics than that of the full one - band model . here",
    "we argue that this is indeed the case .",
    "an alternative is to begin at the same starting point , _ i.e. _ the limit @xmath11 resulting in spin degrees of freedom at the cu sites .",
    "the o sublattice on which the doped hole moves is kept in the model , not projected out like in the one - band approach , see fig . [",
    "fig1](c ) .",
    "this leads to a bigger hilbert space than for one - band models ( yet smaller than for the emery model ) but because spin and charge degrees of freedom are no longer lumped together , the resulting low - energy hamiltonian is simpler and makes it easier to understand its physics .    the effective model for a layer with a single doped hole , which for convenience we continue to call  the three - band model  although it is its @xmath32 approximation ,",
    "was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite and reads : @xmath60 the meaning of its terms is as follows : @xmath61 is again the nn afm superexchange between the cu spins @xmath62 , so @xmath63 of the one - band models .",
    "the main difference is indicated by the presence of the prime , which reflects the absence of coupling for the pair that has the doping hole on their bridging o. the next term , @xmath64 is the exchange of the hole s",
    "spin @xmath65 with its two nn cu spins .",
    "it arises from virtual hopping of a hole between a cu and the o hosting the doped hole .    like in eq .",
    "( [ emr ] ) , @xmath21 is the kinetic energy of the doping hole as it moves on the o sublattice .",
    "it is supplemented by @xmath66 which describes effective hopping mediated by virtual processes where a cu hole hops onto an empty o orbital , followed by the doping hole filling the now empty cu state @xcite .",
    "this results in effective nn or next nn hopping of the doped hole , with a swapping of its spin with that of the cu involved in the process .",
    "the explicit form of this term is : @xmath67 reflecting the change of the cu spin located at @xmath68 from @xmath17 to @xmath69 as the hole changes its spin from @xmath69 to @xmath17 while moving to another o. the sign @xmath70 is due to the overlaps of the 2@xmath71 and 3@xmath72 orbitals involved in the process .    for typical values of the parameters of the emery model @xcite and using @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ev ) as the unit of energy , the dimensionless values of the other parameters are @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78",
    "we use these values in the following , noting that the results are not qualitatively changed if they are varied within reasonable ranges . for complete technical details of the derivation of this effective hamiltonian and further discussions of higher order terms , as well as a comparison with other work along similar lines @xcite , the reader is referred to the supplemental material of ref . @xcite .",
    "the ground state of the undoped layer is not a simple nel - ordered state .",
    "this is due to the spin fluctuations term @xmath79 present in @xmath80 , which play an important role in lower dimensions .",
    "a 2d solution can only be obtained numerically , for finite size systems @xcite .",
    "the absence of an analytic description of the afm background has been an important barrier to understanding what happens upon doping , because the undoped state itself is so complex .",
    "it is also the reason why most progress has been computational in nature and mostly restricted to finite clusters .",
    "while such results are very valuable , it can be rather hard to gauge the finite - size effects and , more importantly , to gain intuition about the meaning of the results .    because our goal is to verify whether the two kinds of models have equivalent quasiparticles , which requires us to understand qualitatively what controls their dynamics",
    ", we take a different approach .",
    "we use a quasi - analytic variational method valid for an infinite layer , so that finite - size effects are irrelevant . by systematically increasing the variational space we can gauge the accuracy of our guesses and , moreover ,",
    "also gain intuition about the importance of various configurations and the role played by various terms in the hamiltonians .",
    "where possible , we compare our results with those obtained by exact diagonalization ( ed ) for small clusters , providing further proof for the validity of our method .    for simplicity , in the following we focus on the one - band model ;",
    "the three - band model is treated similarly , as already discussed in ref .",
    "because we do not have an analytic description of the afm background wavefunction , we divide the task into two steps .      in the first step we completely ignore the spin fluctuations by setting @xmath81 , to obtain the so - called @xmath0-@xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath82 model . as a result",
    ", the undoped layer is described by a nel state @xmath83 with up / down spins on the a / b sublattice , without any spin - fluctuations .",
    "one may expect this to be a very bad starting point , given the importance of spin - fluctuations for a 2d afm . at the very least",
    ", this will allow us to gauge how important these spin fluctuations really are , insofar as the quasiparticle dynamics is concerned , when we include them in step two .",
    "it is also worth remembering that the cuprates are 3d systems with long - range afm order stabilized up to rather high temperatures by inter - layer coupling , in the undoped compounds .",
    "the spin fluctuations must therefore be much less significant in the undoped state than is the case for a 2d layer , so our starting point may be closer to reality than a wavefunction containing the full description of the 2d spin fluctuations .",
    "magnons ( spins wrongly oriented with respect to their sublattice ) are created or removed when the zrs hops between the two magnetic sublattices .",
    "the creation of an additional magnon costs up to @xmath84 in ising exchange energy as up to four bonds involving the magnon now become fm .",
    "this naturally suggests the introduction of a variational space in terms of the maximum number of magnons included in the calculation .    this variational calculation is a direct generalization of that of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the quasiparticle of the @xmath0-@xmath82 model was studied including configurations with up to 7 _ adjacent _ magnons .",
    "that work showed that keeping configurations with up to three magnons is already accurate if @xmath85 is not too large , so here we restrict ourselves to this smaller variational space .",
    "( note that three is the minimum number of magnons to allow for trugman loops @xcite , see discussion below , so a lower cutoff is not acceptable ) .",
    "the configurations included are the same as in ref .",
    "@xcite , where this type of approach was first pioneered .    to be more specific , our goal is to calculate the one - hole retarded green s function at zero temperature : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the resolvent of the one - band hamiltonian ( [ hamm ] ) and @xmath88 here @xmath89 is the number of sites in each magnetic sublattice , @xmath90 is restricted to the magnetic brillouin zone depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) , and we set @xmath91 . the spectrum is identical if the quasiparticle is located on the spin - down sublattice : conservation of the total @xmath92-axis spin guarantees that there is no mixing between these two subspaces with different spin .",
    "taking the appropriate matrix element of the identity @xmath93 leads to the equation of motion : @xmath94g({\\bf k},\\omega ) -t\\sum_{{\\boldsymbol\\epsilon}}f_1({\\bf k},\\omega , { { \\boldsymbol\\epsilon}})=1.\\ ] ] the four vectors @xmath95 point to the nn cu sites , @xmath1 is the ising exchange energy cost for adding the zrs ( four afm bonds are removed ) and @xmath96\\ ] ] is the kinetic energy of the zrs moving freely on its own magnetic sublattice .",
    "nn hopping creates a magnon as the hole moves to the other magnetic sublattice ; this introduces the one - magnon propagators : @xmath97 with the hole on the b sublattice and therefore a present magnon on a nn a site , to conserve the total spin .    equation ( [ g1 ] )",
    "is exact ( for an ising background ) but it requires the @xmath98 propagators to solve .",
    "their equations of motion ( eom ) are obtained similarly : @xmath99 f_1 ( { { \\boldsymbol\\epsilon } } ) =   t'\\sum_{{\\boldsymbol\\epsilon}'\\perp { \\boldsymbol\\epsilon}}f_1({{\\boldsymbol\\epsilon}'})+t''f_1(-{{\\boldsymbol\\epsilon } } ) \\\\+t[g({\\bf       k},\\omega)+f_2({{\\boldsymbol\\epsilon } , { \\boldsymbol\\epsilon}})+\\sum_{{\\boldsymbol\\epsilon}'\\perp { \\boldsymbol\\epsilon}}f_2({{\\boldsymbol\\epsilon } , { \\boldsymbol\\epsilon}'})].\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] note that 2@xmath8 and 3@xmath9 nn hopping keeps the hole on the b sublattice and thus conserve the number of magnons , linking @xmath100 to other @xmath100 propagators . however , nn hopping links @xmath100 to @xmath101 if the hole hops back to the a sublattice by removing the existing magnon , but also to two - magnon propagators , @xmath102 , if it hops to a different a site than that hosting the first magnon .",
    "the equation above imposes the variational restriction that the two magnons are adjacent , so only @xmath103 with @xmath104 are kept .",
    "this is a good approximation for the low - energy quasiparticle whose magnons are bound in its cloud , and thus spatially close .",
    "( because fewer afm bonds are disrupted , these configurations cost less exchange energy than those with the magnons apart ) .",
    "of course , the hole could also travel far from the first magnon ( using 2@xmath8 and 3@xmath9 nn hopping ) before returning to the a sublattice to create a second magnon far from the first . such higher energy states  ignored here but which we consider in the three - band model , see below  contribute to the spin - polaron+one magnon continuum which appears above the quasiparticle band .",
    "the relevance of this higher - energy feature is discussed below .",
    "eom for the new propagators are generated similarly .",
    "we do not write them here because they are rather cumbersome , but it is clear that the eom for @xmath102 link them other @xmath102 , as well as to some of the @xmath100 and to three - magnon propagators @xmath105 .",
    "again we only keep those propagators consistent with the variational choice of having the 3 magnons on adjacent sites .",
    "since 4-magnon configurations are excluded , the eom for @xmath105 link them only to other @xmath105 and to various @xmath102 .",
    "the resulting closed system of coupled linear equations is solved numerically to find all these propagators , including @xmath106 .",
    "with @xmath106 known , we can find the quasiparticle dispersion @xmath107 as the lowest pole of the spectral function @xmath108 .",
    "of course , this is the quasiparticle in a nel background , _",
    "i.e. _ when the spin fluctuations of the afm background are completely ignored .      to estimate the effect of the background spin fluctuations ( due to spin flipping of pairs of nn afm spins , described by @xmath109 ) we again invoke a variational principle .",
    "spin fluctuations occuring far from the zrs should have no effect on its dynamics , since they are likely to be `` undone '' before the hole arrives in their neighborhood ( they can be thought of as vacuum fluctuations ) .",
    "the spin fluctuations that influence the dynamics of the hole must be those that occur in its immediate vicinity and either remove from the quasiparticle cloud pairs of nn magnons generated its motion , or add to it pairs of magnons through such afm fluctuations .    for consistency",
    ", we keep the same variational configurations here like we did at the previous step .",
    "then , eq . ( [ g1 ] ) acquires an additional term on the l.h.s .",
    "equal to : @xmath110 , describing processes where a pair of magnons is created through spin - fluctuations near the hole .",
    "similarly , the eoms for @xmath100/@xmath102/@xmath105 acquire terms proportional to @xmath105/@xmath111/@xmath100 respectively , because spin fluctuations add / remove a pair of magnons to / from their clouds .",
    "this modified system of linear equations has a different solution for @xmath112 , which accounts for the effects of the spin fluctuations that occur close to the hole .",
    "comparison with the previous results will allow us to gauge how important these `` local '' spin fluctuations are to the quasiparticle s dynamics .",
    "accuracy can be systematically improved by increasing the variational space , and implementation of such generalizations is straightforward .",
    "as shown next , the results from the variational calculation with configurations of up to three magnons located on adjacent sites compares well against available ed results and allows us to understand what determines the quasiparticle s dispersion , so we do not need to consider a bigger variational space .",
    "the three - band model is treated similarly , with the variational space again restricted to the same configurations with up to three adjacent magnons .",
    "results for a quasiparticle in the nel background ( no spin fluctuations ) were published in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the reader can find details about the corresponding eoms ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "we will focus primarily on the effect of local spin fluctuations .",
    "these are introduced as explained above , by adding to the eoms terms consistent with the variational space and whose magnon count varies by two .",
    "we first present results for the one - band model .",
    "it is important to note upfront that it has long been known that both spin fluctuations and the longer range hopping must be included in order to obtain the correct dispersion for its quasiparticle @xcite .",
    "( by `` correct dispersion '' we mean one in agreement with the experimental data @xcite ) .",
    "our results confirm these facts , as shown next .",
    "the novelty is , therefore , not in finding these results , but in using them to prove the validity of our variational method and , more importantly , to untangle the specific role that spin fluctuations and long - range hopping play in arriving at this dispersion . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this had not been known prior to this work .",

    "finally , in panel ( d ) we keep the longer range hopping but freeze the spin fluctuations ; this is the @xmath0-@xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath82 model .",

    "its results ( thick lines ) are in fair agreement with those of exact diagonalization ( ed ) for a 32-site cluster , which includes all spin fluctuations @xcite .",
    "results in panel ( c ) agree well with those measured experimentally @xcite .",
    "our bandwidths are somewhat different ; some of this may be due to finite - size effects , as the ed bandwidth varies with cluster size @xcite .",
    "this also suggests that more configurations need to be included before full convergence is reached by our variational method ( these would increase the bandwidth in panel ( b ) and decrease it in panel ( c ) , see below ) .",
    "this is supported by ref .",
    "@xcite , where full convergence for the @xmath0-@xmath82 model was reached when configurations with up to 5 magnons were included .",
    "nevertheless , the agreement is sufficiently good to conclude that the essential aspects of the quasiparticle physics are captured by the three - magnon variational calculation , and to confirm that it suffices to include spin fluctuations only near the hole .",
    "these results clearly demonstrate that both spin fluctuations and longer - range hopping are needed to achieve the correct quasiparticle dispersion shown in panel ( c ) , with deep , nearly isotropic minima at @xmath120 .",
    "absence of longer - range hopping leads to a rather flat dispersion along @xmath7 , see panel ( b ) ; this fact has long been known @xcite . in panel",
    "( d ) , we show that if the longer range hopping is included but spin fluctuations are absent , the dispersion is rather flat along the @xmath121 direction .",
    "we are not aware of previous studies of this case .",

    "the main contributions to @xmath127 and @xmath136 now come from processes like those sketched in fig . [",

    "additional terms must be included to correctly account for the effective interactions between quasiparticles in one - band models , as we demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    from a technical point of view",
    ", their origin is simple to understand . even for the simplified three - band model",
    ", the presence of additional holes leads to additional terms in the hamiltonian @xcite , because the intermediary states are different and this affects the projection onto states with no - double occupancy on cu .",
    "this is going to become even more of an issue if a subsequent projection onto zrs - like states has to be performed , and may well result in an unmanageably complex hamiltonian .",
    "this is why we believe that the ( simplified ) three - band model is a safer option to pursue .",
    "its computational complexity is not that much worse than for one - band models , whereas the hamiltonian is certainly simpler .",
    "in fact , our demonstration here that there is no need to accurately capture the spin fluctuations of the afm background in order to gain a reasonable understanding of the quasiparticle behavior , makes its study significantly simpler .",
    "in particular , it allowed us to study one hole on an infinite layer very simply and efficiently .",
    "generalizations to few holes @xcite and to finite concentrations could also turn out to be easier to carry out than the effort of finding the correct form for a one - band hamiltonian .",
    "of course , there is no guarantee that the ( simplified ) three - band model captures all physics needed to explain cuprates , either .",
    "it is possible that important aspects of the emery model were lost through the projection onto spin degrees of freedom at the cu sites ( this , however , would affect the one - band models just as much ) .",
    "even the emery model itself may not be general enough ; for instance , a generalization to a 5-band model including non - ligand o @xmath6 orbitals might be needed , as suggested recently in ref .",
    "we note that such a generalization can be easily handled by our method ( provided that one can still project onto spin degrees of freedom at the cu sites ) , as showed in ref .",
    "@xcite where we found that these states do not change the quasiparticle dispersion much , although they do have an effect on its wavefunction .    while careful investigation of such scenarios is left as future work , one clear lesson from this study",
    "is that obtaining the correct dispersion for the quasiparticle of an effective model is _ not sufficient _ to validate that model .",
    "the dispersion can have the correct shape for the wrong reasons , as we showed to be the case for the @xmath0-@xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath1 model , where it is due to the interplay between the effects of the longer - range hopping and spin - fluctuations .",
    "the same dispersion is obtained for the simplified three - band model , however in this case the spin - fluctuations play essentially no role , so the underlying physics is very different .",
    "this difference is very likely to manifest itself in other properties , therefore these models are not equivalent despite the similar dispersion of their quasiparticles .",
