    "the statistical properties of interacting spins on the lattice are of fundamental importance for our understanding of equilibrium phase transitions in nature . among them",
    "the most studied candidate is the ising model  @xcite in one , two , and three spatial dimensions finding application in a wide range of physical systems ranging from pure and random ferromagnets  @xcite to neurons  @xcite and hadronic matter  @xcite . for @xmath1 spatial dimensions the usual ising model for a lattice with infinite size possesses a thermal phase transition of second order , signaling the spontaneous symmetry breaking of mirror symmetry and the emergence of a ferromagnetic ( for attractive spin - spin interaction ) phase .",
    "this transition is characterized by the presence of a critical temperature @xmath2 at which a scale - free behavior dominates the underlying phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "the absence of a characteristic scale at the critical point is related to the divergence of the correlation length @xmath3 which in turn leads to the appearance of a variety of power laws with associated critical exponents .",
    "one of the main tasks in the study of models showing critical behavior is the determination of the values of these exponents which are then related to the respective universality classes .    for @xmath4 the ising model with next - neighbor interactions",
    "is analytically solvable  @xcite while for @xmath5 one has to rely on numerical simulations and other approximate type of solutions for its study , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "employing numerical methods constrains the mathematical analysis on lattices with finite size introducing an additional scale in the problem .",
    "this adds a complication in the development of methods to calculate the critical temperature as well as the critical exponents , usually solved by the so called finite - size scaling analysis  @xcite .",
    "this requires the determination of observables in lattices of increasing size in order to extrapolate to the infinite size limit . coming back to the 2d ising model , despite of being analytically solvable , it offers a playground for testing a variety of simulation algorithms  @xcite and in fact a very hard one , since its finite - size scaling analysis possesses severe peculiarities due to the presence of significant , non - universal , logarithmic corrections  @xcite .",
    "a dominant feature of the critical state in ising - like systems , consequence of the absence of a characteristic length scale , is the formation of self - similar ordered clusters of spins with fractal geometry",
    ". the associated fractal dimension of the resulting set of ordered clusters is related to the isothermal critical exponent @xmath0 which in turn determines the universality class of the undergoing transition .",
    "thus , the calculation of the exponent @xmath0 is a very significant task in the simulations of critical systems .",
    "usually , in order to obtain the value of the exponent @xmath0 one can either calculate the fractal dimension of the ordered clusters at @xmath6  @xcite or estimate the so called constrained effective potential  @xcite . for lattices with finite sizes the fractal geometry is an approximate property expressed through self - similar structure between two scales , the constrained effective potential acquires finite volume corrections and the critical temperature is replaced by the pseudocritical one , making the related analysis a highly non - trivial task .",
    "nevertheless the aforementioned methods work quite well for the case of the 3d ising model  @xcite .",
    "however they practically fail to give the right answer in the 2d case since they suffer from the presence of large finite - size corrections , that are hard to control .    in the present work",
    "we develop a method to calculate the critical exponent @xmath0 for ising systems based on properties of the magnetization time series after thermal equilibrium is reached .",
    "the idea is to consider the mean magnetization time series obtained by averaging over a connected small subset of the lattice .",
    "the main advantage of considering such small domains relies on the fact that the number of the microstates determining their thermodynamic properties decreases exponentially with decreasing domain size .",
    "thus , for small domains a much better covering of the available phase space can be achieved . on the other hand",
    "the domains are always open systems and therefore their thermodynamic properties are quite different from those of the entire ( closed ) lattice . based on the distribution of the mean magnetization values within such a small domain one observes that each domain equilibrates at its own effective temperature .",
    "in fact with decreasing size the effective temperature decreases too .",
    "the method of analysis of the domain magnetization time series at equilibrium makes use of fact that for a closed system the distribution of waiting times in the neighborhood of the  false \" vacuum , exhibiting the spontaneous symmetry breaking , is known for temperatures @xmath7 .",
    "namely at @xmath8 the distribution is a power law with an exponent directly related to the isothermal critical exponent @xmath0  @xcite , while for @xmath9 the power law gets gradually destructed and exponential tails appear .",
    "however , for small to moderate waiting times the power - law description is still valid and the connection to @xmath0 holds too  @xcite .",
    "we use here this information to extract the isothermal critical exponent @xmath0 for an ising system .",
    "our basic assumption , validated by our numerical results , is that the waiting - time distributions derived in refs .",
    "@xcite are valid also for an open ising spin system in a thermal environment .",
    "thus , we consider an ensemble consisting of domains of increasing size , parts of an ising lattice at the corresponding ( pseudo)critical temperature . for each such domain",
    "we calculate the mean magnetization as a function of time for a long time interval .",
    "time is measured in single spin flips of the entire lattice .",
    "based on this time series we calculate the distribution of waiting times in the neighborhood of @xmath10 for each domain @xmath11 and from these distributions we determine @xmath0 . for very small domains",
    "the corresponding effective temperature is also extremely small and the distribution of the waiting times becomes pure exponential containing no information for the critical exponent @xmath0 .",
    "thus we use a cutoff on the minimum size of the considered domains .",
    "we apply this approach to the 2d ising model on the square lattice with nearest - neighbor interactions and we obtain a highly accurate estimate for @xmath0 . since the developed method is quite general , it can in principle be applied to a wide class of spin lattices in two , but also higher dimensions .",
    "the rest of paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : strategy ] we present the general strategy and the method of analysis employed to calculate @xmath0 for arbitrary spin models of ising type on the lattice . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we apply the proposed method to the case of the 2d ising model on the square lattice and we discuss the obtained results . finally , our concluding remarks are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider the fluctuations of the magnetization for a spin model of the typical ising form at thermal equilibrium defined by the hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath12 where as usual @xmath13 and @xmath14 indicates summation over nearest neighbors . the condition @xmath15 restricts the following considerations to the ferromagnetic case , although most of the obtained results are expected to hold more generally .",
    "we are interested for the time evolution of the magnetization calculated in a connected compact domain @xmath16 , subset of the entire lattice .",
    "thus , the observable we focus on is defined via @xmath17 @xmath18 counts the number of sites in @xmath16 and @xmath19 is the time unit measured in the minimum time needed for the flip of a single spin .",
    "clearly @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the total number of sites of the lattice .",
    "when @xmath22 approaches @xmath21 then @xmath23 approaches the total magnetization of the spin lattice @xmath24 .",
    "an important property of the magnetization time series is that it carries information of the approach to criticality , clearly manifested during relaxation in the effect of critical slowing down  @xcite .",
    "the imprints of criticality are present also to the post - equilibrium dynamics , as demonstrated in ref .  @xcite .",
    "it is the latter information we will use in the present approach .",
    "in fact it is based on the observation that close to the critical point the magnetization time series becomes _ sticky _ in the neighborhood of the minimum of the effective potential of the magnetization which undergoes the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "this behavior resembles intermittent dynamics close to a bifurcation  @xcite .",
    "calculated in @xmath25 domains of a square ising lattice with linear size @xmath26 for various values of @xmath18 : ( a ) @xmath27 , ( b ) @xmath28 , and ( c ) @xmath29 . in panel",
    "( d ) the corresponding distribution for the entire lattice is shown . in each plot",
    "the arrows indicate the half - variance region around the mean value @xmath30 used in the calculation of the waiting - time distribution.,width=8 ]    let us assume that local equilibrium , i.e. equilibrium with the domain @xmath16 , is reached before the establishment of global equilibrium . then , after reaching global equilibrium , the domain magnetization time series @xmath23 fluctuates around a stationary mean value .",
    "the fluctuations define a probability distribution @xmath31 $ ] characteristic for the considered domain . for a periodic lattice",
    "the exact position of the domain is irrelevant and the distribution @xmath32 depends only on the size of @xmath16 .",
    "in fact each domain of different size is characterized by a different probability distribution @xmath32 at equilibrium .",
    "this is quite plausible since pseudocritical temperatures calculated for lattices of different size increase with decreasing lattice size . according to this reasoning",
    "the pseudocritical temperature of the entire lattice will be equivalent to an effective temperature below the pseudocritical one for smaller domains embedded in the lattice .",
    "this can be clearly seen in the distribution @xmath32 which is expected to attain the spontaneously broken form for each such domain .",
    "concerning criticality the main claim of the present work is that one can use the time series @xmath23 ( leading to @xmath32 is the post - equilibrium phase ) to decode information related to the isothermal critical exponent @xmath0 .",
    "based on @xmath23 it is straightforward to calculate the waiting times @xmath33 in the neighborhood of the false vacuum at @xmath34 .",
    "there is no strict definition of the term `` neighborhood '' here and the half of the variance of the distribution @xmath32 can be used as a typical neighborhood size .",

    "( [ eq : lamdiscr ] ) becomes a pure power law with @xmath46 .",
    "thus the exponent @xmath47 encodes information of the isothermal critical exponent @xmath0 .",
    "interestingly enough , this information is also encoded in the waiting - time distribution around the false vacuum just after the spontaneous symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding distribution @xmath48 attains the form @xmath49 ^{\\frac{\\zeta(l)}{\\zeta(l)-1 } } } , \\label{eq : lamdisbcr}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are further characteristic exponents .",
    "note that in both eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lamdiscr ] ) and ( [ eq : lamdisbcr ] ) above , the under - scripts @xmath52 and @xmath53 refer to critical and below critical regimes . for an infinite system @xmath54 while @xmath55 tends to a non - universal finite value greater than 1 . for small @xmath56",
    "the density @xmath57 behaves as a power law @xmath58 while for large @xmath56 it decays exponentially @xmath59 .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ eq : lamdisbcr ] ) can be used to estimate @xmath0 for @xmath60 .",
    "this task will be fulfilled in the next section . using a set of coexisting domains @xmath11 of different sizes @xmath61 embedded in an ising lattice",
    ", we will first determine the waiting - time distribution @xmath62 for each such domain .",
    "then fitting the resulting distribution with a power law in the small @xmath56 region we will determine the exponent @xmath50 and subsequently the isothermal critical exponent @xmath0 .",
    "the main assumption here is that each domain can be considered as an ising lattice of smaller size than the size of the lattice it is embedded into .",
    "the ising spins of the entire lattice , not belonging to the considered domain , form a thermal environment for this domain at a temperature which depends on the domain size @xmath61 .",
    "there is a good reason for adopting this scenario : as it will be demonstrated in the next section the properties of small domains are obtained with much higher accuracy than those of the larger domains probably due to an exponentially better covering of the corresponding microstate space .",
    "this leads to a robust estimation of the isothermal exponent @xmath0 .",
    "of course the size of the domains should not arbitrarily decrease since in this case eq .",
    "( [ eq : lamdisbcr ] ) is not valid any more .",
    "we apply the method of analysis described in the previous sec .  [",
    "sec : strategy ] on the square - lattice ising model attempting to calculate the isothermal critical exponent @xmath0 . in the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ising ] ) we use the homogeneous case @xmath63 for all pairs @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we investigated the equilibrium dynamics of the ising spins , mainly for a lattice set - up with linear size @xmath26 .    in the pre - equilibrium phase the spin dynamics",
    "is simulated using the wolff s cluster algorithm  @xcite , which is a variant of the original swendsen - wang algorithm  @xcite , for reasons that are exemplified below . in the swendsen - wang algorithm ,",
    "small and large clusters are created . while the destruction of critical correlations is predominantly due to the large clusters",
    ", a considerable amount of effort is spent on constructing the smaller clusters . in wolff s implementation , no decomposition of the entire spin configuration into clusters takes place . on the contrary ,",
    "only a single cluster is formed , which is then always flipped .",
    "if this cluster turns out to be large , correlations are destroyed as effectively as by means of the large clusters in the swendsen - wang algorithm , without the effort of creating the smaller clusters that fill up the remainder of the lattice .",
    "if the wolff cluster turns out to be small , then not much is gained , but also not much computational effort is required . as a result , critical slowing down using the wolff implementation is suppressed even more strongly than in the swendsen - wang case .    after reaching equilibrium , a hybrid algorithm is employed involving mainly single spin flips mixed with rare wolff s steps to increase ergodicity .",
    "the latter is reflected in the smooth form obtained for the magnetization histograms .",
    "actually the obtained results are robust against changes of the simulation algorithm provided that time is expressed in single spin flips .",
    "thus , for example , employing wolff s cluster algorithm one has to take into account the size of the cluster when assigning a characteristic time to the cluster flipping .",
    "this increases the corresponding waiting times .    in our calculations we used square domains of linear sizes @xmath66 .",
    "the pseudocritical temperature @xmath67 is estimated through the magnetization histogram as the minimum temperature for which symmetry breaking is not yet globally established . in fig .",

    "these domains equilibrate locally to a lower temperature than that of the entire lattice . when this temperature is not too far from the pseudocritical one , then the waiting - time distribution carries information of the critical point related to @xmath0 , as shown in ref .",
    "furthermore , it can be calculated with higher accuracy since the number of microstates of the smaller domain is exponentially reduced compared to that of the entire lattice . for small to moderate values of the waiting times ,",
    "the associated distribution is a power law with an exponent which is related to @xmath0 and can be estimated employing a suitable fitting procedure .",
    "subsequently the sequence of the fitted exponents as a function of the increasing domain size can be used for an accurate determination of @xmath0 .",
    "the proposed method has been applied to the 2d ising model on the square lattice providing remarkably good results .",
    "let us note here that our choice to use the 2d ising ferromagnet as a platform model was dictated by the existence of an exact analytical result of the isothermal exponent , so that a direct comparison was possible .",
