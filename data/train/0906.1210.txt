    "this is a strong evidence that the emergence of magnetic flux is an efficient process for magnetic helicity injection .",
    "the cme observed at 06:50 ut associated with this m1.6 flare very probably ejects part of this injected helicity in the heliosphere .    in section 3",
    "we have described in detail the emerging region . the diverging flow pattern of the emerging flux ( nw for bz @xmath45 0 and se for bz @xmath45 0 , bz being the normal component of the magnetic field ) , and the shape of the bz patterns ( especially in the bz@xmath460 region ) , both are highly suggestive of magnetic `` tongues '' ( figure [ tongue ] ) .",
    "the observed longitudinal magnetic field is approximately bz because the region is close to the disk center .",
    "`` tongues '' with such an orientation and evolution indicate the emergence of a flux tube with right hand twist , i.e. positive magnetic helicity , h@xmath460 @xcite .",
    "this sign corresponds to the hemispheric helicity rule discussed by , who found that @xmath47 70 @xmath48 of southern active regions have h@xmath460 , as the region studied by us .    in section 4 ,",

    "` j ' shaped ribbons , the twisted flux tube should have a positive helicity . note that this qsl interpretation is also consistent with the propagation of brightenings ( see section 4.1 ) , in the frame of slipping or slip - running reconnection @xcite .",
    "for the same event we find a good agreement between the magnetic helicity sign of the emerging flux and the signature of reconnection in the corona ( figure [ tongue ] ) .",
    "this kind of association was never found before in a targeted study of a particular region .",
    "analyzed the eruption of a kink - unstable filament accompanied by a flare having j shaped ribbons but did not describe the emergence phase of the region .",
    "regarding the `` tongues '' , only a few papers have described such phenomena ( , ) , and they have not associated them with flare signatures .",
    "at the periphery of the active region 10365 , secondary arc - shaped brightenings are observed at the beginning of the main flare on 27 may , 2003 .",
    "these secondary ribbons are visible in h@xmath0 ( r@xmath23 , r@xmath24 in figure 6 ) and in euv ( soho / eit figure 7 )    at the periphery of the active region , we observe loops in 195   connecting these secondary ribbons with the central part of the region and it is clear that they changed their directions during the flare ( see the direction of loop l1 before the flare and the direction of loop l@xmath23 after the flare)(figure [ ha_mdi ] ( e , f ) .",
    "the secondary ribbons do not belong to the main flare , they correspond to the loops connecting relatively stable polarities of the network .",
    "active region noaa 10365 is highly sheared close to the main inversion magnetic line . however , at large - scales in the active region we infer that the corona is in a near potential state , as is frequently observed far from magnetic inversion lines @xcite .    the h@xmath0 and euv secondary ribbons can be interpreted by means of a topological analysis of the coronal magnetic field above the active region noaa 10365 calculated from a lfff model @xmath49 . for simplicity , we used a potential field model , with @xmath0=0 .",
    "this approximation is justified since we are dealing with fields that are far from the main current - carrying emerging and erupting twisted fields , the latter can not be modelled in this approximation .",
    "therefore we do not model the ` j'-shaped ribbons .",
    "magnetic extrapolations in a potential configuration show the existence of null points , separatrices , larger quasi - separatrix layers at high altitudes that could be responsible for the brightening of the secondary ribbons (; ; ) .",
    "the lfff extrapolation method is the one used in the database of french online magnetic extrapolations ( fromage ) .",
    "it is based on the decomposition of the observed longitudinal field ( z=0 ) in harmonics using the discrete fast fourier transform .",

    "all are co - aligned with the mdi magnetogram at 06:34:11 ut . the last panel represents a 3d view of the extrapolated magnetic field lines in a box smaller than the computation box , to see better the connectivities .",
    "note that since the magnetic field lines drawn in red in the central part of the region are not reliable , this area is strongly sheared due to the rotating emerging flux and the potential approximation is not appropriated , as we have mentioned above .",
    "the magnetic field lines joining places out of the active regions are drawn in yellow .",
    "these field lines are rather arbitrary because of the effects of the periodicity of the method and because of the negative flux imbalance of the active region .",
    "the green / dark blue lines correspond to loops connecting the secondary ribbon r@xmath50/r@xmath51 to the eruptive area in the center of the active region . though not observed , we consider that these large - scale and weakly sheared loops exist because of the continuous presence of the secondary ribbons .",
    "the light blue lines are associated to ribbon r@xmath52 .",
    "the results of the potential field extrapolation show what follows .",
    "the ribbons r@xmath50 and r@xmath51 visible in the eit images and in h@xmath0 ( msdp ) are well explained using this approach . the lines with the ends in these positive polarities and going towards the periphery of the region map well the loops directed toward the west and the south in the images of eit/171 (see figure [ ha_mdi ] ( e , f ) and [ extra ] ( a , b ) ) .",
    "the pattern of field lines linked to r@xmath52 indicates that this zone is more eruptive than we expected because numerous lines connect to the main flare .",
    "some blue lines are also linked to a small bright plage .",
    "the overlying field lines indicate the possibility of the existence of a null point where some high altitude coronal reconnection could have occurred , i.e. in the zone between the red , dark blue and the yellow lines in the north of the active region ( figure [ extra ] , arrow ) .",
    "indeed , the co - alignment with the h@xmath0 msdp image shows that the secondary ribbons are located at the footpoints of the lines that come from this zone .",
    "different scenarios could explain the triggering of this high altitude reconnection and its manifestation as secondary remote ribbons . in case of a pre - brightening of the secondary ribbons before the flare",
    ", we could infer that we see a signature of the breakout model @xcite as observed in some events (; ) . in the case of brightenings occurring at the same time as the flare",
    ", these could be a remanant of an arc - shaped moreton wave or eit wave surrounding the active region (; ) .",
    "the brightenings observed in our case seem to be only the stationary part of the eit waves that explained by joule heating at the sites of qsls .",
    "described the sequential chromospheric brightenings ( scb ) that appear to be different from the moreton / eit waves .",
    "they explained these scb as the footpoints of field lines that extend into the corona , where they are energized in sequence by magnetic reconnection as coronal fields tear from the chromosphere during the eruption .",
    "we studied the m1.6 flare of may 27 , 2003 , occurring in the magnetically complex active region noaa 10365 .",
    "we used multi - wavelength observations , which include different instruments : the msdp operating in the meudon solar tower , rhessi , trace , soho / eit and soho / mdi .",
    "the evolution of the photospheric magnetic configuration shows that the active region noaa 10365 is characterized by the emergence of a twisted large magnetic flux tube .",
    "as the twisted flux is rising , diverging flows lead to a peculiar pattern of the photospheric longitudinal magnetic field .",
    "the elongated polarities , positive and negative , indicate that a right hand twisted flux tube emerges exhibiting two elongated `` tongues '' @xcite .",
    "this implies to an increase of positive helicity , as also noticed by .    in h@xmath0 as well as in trace",
    "1600   we observe a double ` j ' shaped ribbon distribution .",
    "this corresponds to a positive magnetic helicity signature .",
    "the asymmetric sheared distribution of the non - thermal hxr sources observed by rhessi in the 25 - 50 kev range also confirms this result .",
    "it is the first time that we have been able to find circumstantial evidence for the same sign of helicity in the flux emergence and the eruption signatures , although it has already been predicted that sunspot whorls , tongues , ` j'-shaped ribbons or sigmoids are signatures of magnetic helicity of the same sign according to their shape ( see the review by ) .    regarding secondary arc - shaped ribbons , observed at the periphery of the active region , we are able to correlate them with separatrices found in potential field extrapolation using the code from the database fromage .",
    "two scenarios are possible to explain the brightenings of the secondary ribbons : a breakout of the overlying magnetic field lines before the main flare as proposed , and/or some compression and ohmic dissipation produced in separatrices during the flare , as proposed by to explain the components of moreton / euv waves .",
    "unfortunately , the lack of high cadence observations with soho / eit and the limited field of view of trace do not allow to conclude if either scenario indeed applies here .",
