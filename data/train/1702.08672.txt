    "<S> simple arguments based on equilibrium thermodynamics do not predict this steady state , although they give the correct temperature requirements for cooling . while it was shown that utilizing squeezed states allows the refrigerator to transition from a heating to cooling regime , hence demonstrating that squeezing could be used as a quantum fuel , when directly compared to the thermal work reservoir we could also observe a diminished performance of the refrigerator . </S>",
