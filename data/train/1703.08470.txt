    "there are many reasons , both from experimental observations and theoretical considerations , to expect physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) , such as the hierarchy problem , neutrino oscillations and dark matter .",
    "many numerous attempts have been done and are still in progress to build new physics models which can explain these puzzles . among them , some well - known examples are the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite and the two - higgs - doublet models ( 2hdm ) @xcite , so the latter is known as the simplest model . in many extensions of the standard model ( sm ) such as the 2hdm",
    ", the higgs sector of the sm is enlarged typically by adding an extra doublet of complex higgs fields . in the 2hdm , after spontaneous symmetry breaking , the two scalar higgs doublets @xmath6 and @xmath7 yield three physical neutral higgs bosons ( h , h , a ) and a pair of charged - higgs bosons @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "+ the observation of a ( singly-)charged - higgs boson in the current and future runs of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) would clearly indicate a definitive evidence of new physics beyond the sm . from the element @xmath8 of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix @xcite , it is found that the top quark is decaying dominantly through @xmath9 in the 2hdm @xcite , providing that the top quark mass ( @xmath10 ) , bottom quark mass ( @xmath11 ) and the charged - higgs boson mass ( @xmath12 ) satisfy the condition : @xmath13 . in this situation",
    ", one may expect measurable effects in the top quark decay width and decay distributions due to the @xmath0-propagator contributions , which are potentially large in the decay chain @xmath14 .",
    "+ at the lhc , it is expected to have a cross section @xmath15 ( nb ) at design energy @xmath16 tev @xcite . with the lhc design luminosity of @xmath17@xmath18s@xmath19 in each of the four experiments",
    ", one may expect to have a @xmath20 pair per second so that with this remarkable potential the lhc can be considered as a superlative top factory which allows one to search for the charged - higgs bosons in the subsequent decay products of the top pairs @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "new results of a search on the charged - higgs bosons in the proton - proton collision at a center of mass energy of @xmath23 tev are reported by the cms @xcite and atlas @xcite collaborations at the lhc , and we shall discuss on these results and the restrictions imposed over the mssm @xmath24 parameter space in section [ sec : three ] . in our numerical analysis we restrict ourselves to the unexcluded regions of this parameter space .",
    "as was mentioned , due to @xmath8 of the ckm matrix the top quark almost exclusively decays to b - quark via @xmath25 , in the 2hdm . on the other hand ,",
    "b - quarks hadronize , via @xmath26 , before they decay so that the decay process @xmath27 is of prime importance and it is an urgent task to predict its partial decay width as realistically and reliably as possible . therefore",
    ", at the lhc of particular interest would be the distribution in the scaled b - hadron energy ( @xmath28 ) in the top quark rest frame so that the study of this distribution is proposed as a new channel to indirect search for the charged higgs bosons . to study the scaled energy spectrum of b - hadrons we determine the quantity @xmath29 .",
    "+ according to the factorization theorem of the qcd - improved parton model @xcite , the b - hadron energy distribution can be determined by the convolution of the partonic differential decay width @xmath30 of the subprocess @xmath25 , with the nonperturbative fragmentation function ( ff ) @xmath31 , as @xmath32 where , @xmath33 stands for the scaled - energy fraction of the bottom quark and the @xmath31-ff describes the splitting process @xmath26 in which @xmath34 refers to the unobserved final state particles . in ( [ azi ] ) , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the factorization and renormalization scales , respectively , and the integral convolution is defined as @xmath37 .    in @xcite",
    ", we studied the energy spectrum of the bottom - flavored mesons through unpolarized top quark decays in the 2hdm at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of the qcd radiative corrections . in @xcite",
    ", we studied the spin - dependent energy distribution of b - mesons produced through polarized top decays in the massless scheme or zero - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( zm - vfns ) @xcite where the zero mass parton approximation is also applied to the bottom quark .",
    "this massless approximation simplifies the evaluation of the nlo qcd corrections largely but at the price of losing the accuracy of analysis .",
    "for example , by this approximation the results for the energy spectrum of b - mesons are independent of the model selected .    in the present work ,",
    "we impose the effects of bottom quark mass on the spin - dependent energy spectrum of b - mesons employing the general - mass variable - flavor - number ( gm - vfn ) scheme in which we preserve the b - quark mass from the beginning .",
    "our calculations are done in a special helicity frame where the polarization direction of the top quark is evaluated with respect to the b - quark three - momentum @xmath38 . as will be shown",
    ", the results are different in two variants of the 2hdm and it is found that the nlo corrections with @xmath39 to be significant , specifically , when the type - ii 2hdm is considered .    in the sm , due to @xmath8 the top quark decays dominantly through the decay mode @xmath40 . in @xcite",
    ", we investigated the energy distribution of b - mesons produced in polarized and unpolarized top quark decays in the sm .",
    "for the unpolarized top decays , the total distribution of the b - hadron energy is obtained by the summation of two contributions due to the decay modes @xmath9 ( in the 2hdm ) and @xmath40 ( in the sm ) , i.e. @xmath41 . the same result is valid for the polarized top quark decay as long as the spin direction of the polarized top quark is evaluated relative to the b - quark three - momentum , as in our present work .",
    "thus , at the lhc any deviation of the b - meson energy spectrum from the sm predictions can be considered as a signal for the existence of charged higgs .",
    "although , the sm contribution is normally larger than the one coming from the 2hdm ( this comparison is studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but there is always a clear separation between the decay channels @xmath42 and @xmath25 in both the @xmath43 pair production and the @xmath44 single top production at the lhc , this point is mentioned in @xcite .    as a last point ; for the decay chain @xmath14 one has @xmath45 in the narrow width approximation for the higgs boson . for the numerical values applied in this work , the branching ratio @xmath46 @xcite , to a very high accuracy . therefore , the results presented in this work are also valid for the decay chain @xmath47 .",

    "here , we concentrate on the decay process @xmath48 in the general 2hdm , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the doublets whose vacuum expectation values give masses to the down and up type quarks , respectively , and a linear combination of the charged components of @xmath6 and @xmath7 also gives the physical charged higgs @xmath1 ( @xmath50 ) . the parameter @xmath51 is defined in the following .",
    "basically , the dynamics of the current - induced @xmath52 transition is embodied in the hadronic tensor @xmath53 , where @xmath54 denotes the spin of the top quark . at the nlo qcd radiative corrections , only two types of intermediate states are contributed ; @xmath55 for the born level term and @xmath4 one - loop contributions and @xmath56 for the @xmath4 tree graph contribution . in the sm , where one has @xmath42 , the weak current is given by @xmath57 while in the 2hdm , the current is given by @xmath58 .",
    "generally , in models with two higgs doublets and generic coupling to all the quarks , it is difficult to avoid tree level flavor changing neutral currents , therefore , we limit ourselves to models that naturally stop these problems by restricting the higgs coupling . as may be found in @xcite , the first possibility is to have the doublet @xmath6 coupling to all bosons and the doublet @xmath7 coupling to all the quarks ( called model i in the following ) .",
    "this model leads to the coupling factors as @xmath59 where , @xmath60 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two electrically neutral components of the two higgs doublets and the weak coupling factor @xmath61 is related to the fermi s coupling constant by @xmath62 .",
    "+ in the second possibility ( called model ii ) , the doublet @xmath7 couples to the right - chiral up - type quarks ( @xmath63 ) while the @xmath6 couples to the right - chiral down - type quarks . in this model",
    "the coupling factors read @xmath64 these models are mostly known as type - i and type - ii 2hdm scenarios .",
    "the type - ii is the higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) up to susy corrections @xcite .",
    "two other models ( models iii and iv ) are also possible which are explained in our previous work @xcite in detail .",

    ", we just mention that the analytical results presented for the partonic process @xmath65 are the same both in models i and iv and also in models ii and iii . + in the rest frame of a polarized top quark decaying into a b - quark and a higgs boson ( and a gluon at nlo ) , the final - state particles @xmath66 define an event frame .",
    "relative to this event plane , the polarization direction of top quark can be defined . in this work ,",
    "we analyze the decay mode @xmath67 in the rest frame of the polarized top quark where the three - momentum of the bottom quark points into the direction of the positive @xmath68-axis and the polar angle @xmath69 is defined as the angle between the polarization vector of top quark and the @xmath68-axis , see fig .  1 of ref",

    "in the notation above , the first and second terms in the curly bracket correspond to the unpolarized and polarized differential decay rates , respectively . as usual , we define the scaled - energy fraction of the bottom quark as @xmath73 the @xmath4 radiative corrections to the unpolarized differential width @xmath74 have been studied in @xcite , extensively , and the nlo qcd corrections to the polarized partial rate @xmath75 in the zm - vfn scheme ( with @xmath76 ) are studied in @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we compute the nlo qcd radiative corrections to the polarized partial rate @xmath77 in the gm - vfn scheme where @xmath39 is considered from the beginning .",
    "these analytical results are new and presented for the first time .",
    "it is straightforward to compute the born term contribution to the partial decay rate of the polarized top quark in the 2hdm in the presence of the b - quark mass .",
    "the born term amplitude for the process @xmath48 can be parameterized as _ @xmath78 _ , so for the squared amplitude one has : @xmath79 , where we replaced @xmath80 in the unpolarized dirac string by @xmath81 in the polarized state . then",

    "charged higgs bosons @xmath0 are predicted in many extensions of the standard model consist of , at least , two higgs doublets , of which the simplest are the two - higgs - doublet models ( 2hdm ) so the discovery of them would clearly indicate unambiguous evidence for the presence of new physics beyond the sm . although , the charged higgs bosons have been searched for in high energy experiments , in particular , at the tevatron , atlas and cms but they have not been seen so far and a definitive search is a program that still has to be carried out by the cern lhc .    in this work , which is a fundamental extension of our previous work , we introduce a channel to indirect search for the charged higgs bosons .",
    "in fact , since the main production mode of light charged higgses in the 2hdm is through the top quark decay , @xmath25 , and whence bottom quarks hadronize ( @xmath198 ) before they decay , then the study of b - meson energy spectrum in the decay mode @xmath27 would be of prime importance at the lhc . in other words , at the lhc any deviation of the b - meson energy spectrum from the sm predictions @xcite can be considered as a signal for the existence of charged higgs .    in @xcite , using the massless or zm - vfn scheme ( with @xmath76 ) we studied the spin - dependent energy distribution of b - mesons ( @xmath220 ) produced through the polarized top decays in a special helicity coordinate system , where the event plane lies in the @xmath221 plane and the b - quark three - momentum is considered along the @xmath68-axis . in this system the polarization vector of the top quark is evaluated relative to the b - quark three - momentum . in the zm - vfn scheme ,",
    "since all information on the @xmath11 dependence of the b - hadron spectrum is wasted , then our results are reliable just for the type - i 2hdm scenario . in the present work",
    ", we studied the same decay mode in the gm - vfn scheme where @xmath39 is considered from the beginning , however , considering the b - quark mass effects makes the calculations so complicated . unlike the massless results , the massive decay rates are extremely dependent on the scenario selected in the 2hdm , specifically , when the type - ii 2hdm scenario is concerned .",
    "our results show that the most reliable predictions for the b - hadron energy spectrum are made in the gm - vfn scheme .",
    "note that , since for the branching ratio of the decay @xmath222 one has @xmath46 to a very high accuracy , then the results presented in this work for @xmath194 are also valid for @xmath223 .",
    "our formalism elaborated in this work can be also extended to other hadrons , such as pions , kaons and protons , etc . , using the nonperturbative @xmath224 ffs extracted in @xcite , relying on their universality and scaling violations .",
