    "in 1987 durnin introduced non - diffracting @xmath6 bessel beams as members of a family of solutions to the homogeneous helmholtz equation , with distinctive properties , _",

    "the zero order , @xmath0 , bessel beam has captured most attention due to its peculiar intensity distribution , which is focused on the propagation axis , besides non - diffracting propagation @xcite . + whilst mathematically viable , bessel beams are not square integrable , _",

    "good approximation exists , namely bessel - gauss beams . introduced by gorin _",
    "@xcite these solutions to helmholtz homogeneous equation resemble the ideal @xmath6 bessel beam with the sole difference that they bear finite power ; and , therefore , can be realized experimentally , while retaining the primordial characteristics of self - reconstruction and diffraction - free propagation for lengths of interest to many optical applications , _",

    "_ @xcite were the first to show that it is possible to generate bessel - gauss beams by means of a circular slit and a lens placed one focal length away .",

    "_ @xcite and otero @xcite independently used holograms to alter gauss beams and produce zero and first order bessel - gauss beams ; lately , zhan @xcite has shown that it is possible to generate them by using a radially polarized beam and surface plasmon resonance .",
    "alternatively cong @xcite used phase elements to generate zero order bessel - gauss beams .",
    "recently novel designs have used waveguides to produced diffraction - free beams , _ v.gr .",

    "@xcite experimentally showed that cylindrical waveguides can produce truncated bessel - gauss beams ; and tsai _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that is possible to use an acoustic tunable lens to generate this family of beams .",
    "+ the afore mentioned methods produces high quality beams .",
    "nonetheless their design and fabrication on photonic integrated circuits ( pic ) or planar lightwave circuits ( plc ) would involve complex processing stpdf , rendering the integration into most pics platforms impractical .",
    "it is a matter of debate whether resonator / waveguide designs ( see for example @xcite ) could be used for this purpose . in our experience on such devices ,",
    "the quality of the beam , and conversion efficiency critically depend on the coupling efficiency .",
    "moreover the converted beam free space propagation is limited to @xmath7 @xcite . hence the motivation to attain a fully integrated gauss to @xmath0-bessel - gauss micro - convertor based on current @xmath8 foundry technology is justified . if viable , it could be readily integrated into semiconductor - chip - based optical elements of great importance to a manifold of optical applications .",
    "for instance they have been shown to increase the scanning resolution and tissue penetration depth of optical coherence tomography ( oct ) systems by @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "in durnin s primordial design , an impinging gauss beam diffracts from the surface of an axicon lens @xcite , forming a converging wavefront and thus giving raise to the bessel - gauss beam .",
    "analytically it can be described by means of diffraction at the fresnel limit .",
    "however accurate this method could be , it presumes the outbound field to extent infinitely in the transversal direction in order to comply with the boundary conditions @xcite . to avoid this complication",
    ", we will assume hereafter the output beam to be @xmath0-bessel - gauss as defined by gori _",
    "@xcite , _ i.e. _ the superposition of a gauss and @xmath0-bessel profiles . +",
    "it could be contended that only a pic - integrable - axicon lens would suffice to achieve the desired conversion",
    ". such lens , though , is equivalent to the fabrication of a continuous alteration of the index of refraction , albeit homogeneous , over a conic volume , posing practical and non - trivial integration problems when it is manufactured using the well - established silicon fabrication technologies , namely the difficulty to shape the conic surface . to alleviate this conundrum",
    ", we seek a practical profile of the refractive index that can act as feasible substitute for the axicon lens , suited for integration into current silicon foundry and manufacturing technologies . + before proceeding any further",
    ", it is important to remark that non - singular graded refractive indexes ( grin ) can not yield perfect non - diffracting beams as proven by hayata @xcite .",
    "however a refractive index mapping can potentially achieve high quality conversion from a gauss beam to a @xmath0-bessel - gauss beam , which is different from the fundamental bessel beam presented by durnin _",

    "a heterogeneous medium , the transformation device in ragion @xmath10 has a refractive index map that needs to be calculated in order to echieve the desired beam transformation .",
    "the device is embedded in a homogeneous medium @xmath11 , where bessel and gauss beams are known solutions to the helmholtz equation .",

    "+ in reality , the manipulation of permeability , @xmath20 , is complex . on that account the transformation medium @xmath10 is set to be non - magnetic , with some constant value for @xmath20 .",

    "_ the adjoint problem @xcite , linear sampling @xcite , variational methods @xcite , and lately transformation optics @xcite .",
    "to find a solution to this quandary , we developed a numerical technique based on the variational method and the adjoint problem .",
    "+ we begin by noting that if the input and output beams are symmetrical around the propagation axis @xmath56 , and does as well the field in the transformation region , then we can scale down the problem to two - dimensions : @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the longitudinal and transversal direction , respectively .",
    "concerning our matter at hand both bessel and @xmath0-bessel - gauss beams are symmetric around the propagation axis ; moreover the transformation field as described by the above equations is also symmetric around the axis @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , our problem can be scaled down to a two dimensional numerical scheme .",
    "+ accordingly , the simulation space is discretized on a grid size @xmath58 by @xmath59 .",
    "the solver is given an initial guess of the permittivity map @xmath60 across the region @xmath10 at every point @xmath61 .",
    "the solution to equation [ eq2 ] is computed via a variational approach as described in @xcite : at every point @xmath62 the transversal function of @xmath60 is determined by solving equation [ eqforeps ] to the boundary conditions ( see equation [ eq4 ] ) : @xmath63 and @xmath64 ; and the field at that point @xmath65 .",
    "this iterative approach is carried for every point @xmath62 .",
    "thus the transversal shape of @xmath60 , and consequently that of @xmath66 , is determined to match the resulting field to the ideal transformation given by equation [ eq4 ] . + this method solely does not guarantee that the solution will be exempted of extreme or singular values , withal the variational method is especially sensitive numerical approximations @xcite . to account for the latter and work out the extrema in the refractive index ,",
    "we implement a solution coming from the adjoint problem @xcite .",
    "the extreme and singular values are approximated to the closest value in the defined range .",
    "we then propagate the initial gauss beam through the device and determine how much the field at every point diverges from the ideal transformation of equation [ eq4 ] , including as well the near and far fields .",
    "an iterative refinement on this grid regions follows , as described in @xcite , to match the numerical computation output to the ideal @xmath0-bessel - gauss beam .",
    "the beam propagation method is used to propagate the initial gauss beam through the heterogeneous region @xmath10 . + it is important to note that both , the variational and adjoint problem methods , while widely tested may render inexact solutions due to numerical approximations which can lead to instability and are in general related to the limited resolution of any numerical method .",
    "to counterweight this difficulties the general approach is to use smaller grid sizes even at the expense of computational time increasing exponentially .",
    "the transformation functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 are plotted in figure [ fig.fg ] .",
    "the initial guess for the permittivity map is a gaussian profile in the transversal direction @xmath57 for all points along @xmath56 , width @xmath69 and a maximum peak of @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
