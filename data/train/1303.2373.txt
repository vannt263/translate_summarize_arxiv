    "the cahn  hilliard equation @xcite is often used to model microstructures arising from spinodal decomposition in , say , polymer mixtures .",

    "such a tendency is indeed confirmed by numerical modelling of the cahn  hilliard equation @xcite and is also in agreement with stability analysis of similar models @xcite .    one feature of the cahn ",

    "conventional lithographic techniques are used to create trenches in a silicon wafer  then the trenches are filled with block copolymer which orders into lamellae parallel to the sidewall on annealing @xcite .",

    "we have also found a new class of frozen waves  the ` two - wave solutions ' , but these seem to be unstable and , thus , less important than the usual , one - wave type .    we have also made a more general  and potentially more important  conclusion regarding the energy approach to studies of stability .",
    "if a family of solutions exists and one of them minimizes the energy functional , this does not necessarily mean that all other solutions are unstable .",
    "furthermore , the stability of the minimizer solution can not be guaranteed either : even though it is stable with respect to the perturbation of ` shifting along the family of solutions ' , another perturbation can still destabilize it .    physically , our results imply that when lamellar microstructures of block copolymers are used to template nanowires , one must ensure that only the desired state is created .",
    "this may become more of a critical concern as larger numbers of nanowires are to be created within a single trench . in practice",
    ", some control over this can be exerted via the annealing schedule .",
    "it should also be noted that a kinetically stable quenched state may be selected rather than a true time independent solution to the modified cahn ",

    ", one would expect that ( [ a.2 ] ) is somehow perturbed , but still keeps its structure as a single curve on the @xmath198 plane .",
    "furthermore , the large-@xmath27 part of the ` general ' dispersion relation should not differ much from that of ( [ a.2 ] )  as , for rapidly oscillating @xmath25 , the term involving @xmath24 in equation ( [ 8 ] ) is negligible .            as a result ,",

    "9 , in turn , shows the onset of instability brought by a change of the period of the base wave .",
    "one can see that the waves with @xmath206 are first to lose stability ( which agrees with our asymptotic analysis of the case @xmath86 ) .",
    "finally , we mention that two exact solutions were found for the eigenvalue problem ( [ 8])([9]):@xmath207 in the latter case the disturbance can be found analytically , @xmath208 , and it corresponds to infinitesimal shift of the base wave",
