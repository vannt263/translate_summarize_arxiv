    "although much work has been done on _ the boson _ , found in 2012 at the lhc with a mass of about @xmath2  gev @xcite , there is no definite answer yet whether it is the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson or not .",
    "cp property and self - interaction are two important check points . compared with the latter ,",
    "the former is more easy to examine in present and coming experiments .",
    "differing from the cp - even state in sm , _ the boson _ can be explained as an ambiguous cp defined state , like a mixing of a cp - even state and a cp - odd state in the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) @xcite .",
    "it suggests a kind of cp violation ( cpv ) effect .",
    "the cp mixing angle has been constrained by the higgs experiment signal in much of the literature @xcite .",
    "additionally , the cpv effect can also arise from another source , namely , cpv interactions beyond the sm . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "cpv couplings in @xmath3 vertices ( with @xmath4 ) are required to describe the general tensor structures appearing in high energy experiments . other cpv interactions with defined cp parity higgs",
    "are often be investigated in terms of high dimension operators in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , two kinds of cpv effect , ambiguous cp defined state and cpv interactions , can correct higgs production and decay channels measured by atlas and cms , individually and coherently .",
    "the two must also be analyzed together .",
    "indeed , there is no reason to neglect one or other .",
    "differing from articles addressing a single cpv source , the purpose of this paper to present a combined analysis of the two kinds of cpv effect in observations of _ the boson _",
    ", thereby providing a better means to discriminate between the sm higgs and beyond .    to start a general investigation , we first review a higgs electroweak chiral effective theory in sec.[sec.lag ] .",
    "the proposal in ref.@xcite is a development with a scalar higgs from the electroweak chiral lagrangian in ref.@xcite . as electroweak symmetry",
    "can be broken according to many models that go beyond the sm , such as the strong coupled higgs model , where the lagrangian adopts a nonlinear - realized goldstone boson to describe electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the physical higgs after electroweak symmetry broken is only treated as a singlet scalar .",
    "we add cpv higgs interactions to the lagrangian to complete it in @xmath5 order .",
    "the effective higgs lagrangian provides a larger parameter space to investigate cp properties of _ the boson _ . in sec.[sec.hvv ] , we investigate the higgs interactions with weak gauge bosons .",
    "these couplings provide not only cp conserved vertexes but also cpv form . on the other hand , they are consistently associated with higgs productions and decay at the lhc .",
    "the relation between the @xmath3 tensor structure and low - energy coefficients of the lagrangian is studied .",
    "theoretical constraints are also proposed from unitarity limits in @xmath6 scatterings . in sec.[sec.phenom ] , we classify five interesting cases according to the cpv source .",
    "five classes are identified and we calculate the higgs decay width into the different channels of each class . to avoid complexity in the calculations of higgs production , we choose the sum of signal strengths @xmath7 as a benchmark to define @xmath8 relative ratios of branching ratios @xmath9 . based on this study , we fit the parameters in higgs effective theory to the experimental signal strength at @xmath10  tev and in sec.[sec.fit ] give the optimal parameter values and ranges for the different cases .",
    "finally , a short summary is given in sec.[sec.summary ] .",
    "in the section , we review the construction of a nonlinear - realized effective higgs lagrangian presented in @xcite and generalize it to include cpv terms .",

    "is labeled by a singlet scalar @xmath13 .",
    "the covariant derivatives of the goldstone fields are written @xmath14 here , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 are @xmath18 and @xmath19 gauge fields , respectively .",
    "we adopt @xmath18 covariant building blocks @xcite @xmath20 to express the effective higgs lagrangian .",
    "as @xmath13 is a singlet scalar , it couples to an effective field operator @xmath21 in any way @xmath22 the high power of the higgs field implies that a strongly coupled case appearing at energy scale @xmath23 has been recovered .",
    "the factor including the higgs field in eq.[eq.higgsfunction ] can be integrated into a random function for @xmath13 , i.e. , the higgs field @xmath13 is counted as order @xmath24 .",
    "the lowest order of the chiral lagrangian is just that of the higgs potential @xmath25 the details of @xmath26 depend on the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking . in general , the function can be expressed as a power series in the higgs field @xmath27 that includes the mass term ( for @xmath28 ) and all possible self - interactions .",
    "the next - to - leading order is @xmath29 for this lagrangian , @xmath30 in which @xmath31 takes the scale of spontaneous breaking for electroweak symmetry and @xmath32 denotes trace in the weak isospin space .",
    "the first term is the lagrangian of the nonlinear sigma model .",
    "the second corresponds to leading - order custodial symmetry - violating interactions .",

    "cpv interactions are not vanishing even if cp mixing angle tends to zero ; * case 4 : the most general higgs with all parameters free  this is an extension of case 3 .",
    "ambiguous cp defination is not required to come from cp eigenstate mixing .",
    "these cases completely describe all possible cp properties of _ the boson _ .",

    "the unitarity limit of @xmath0 and @xmath1 scatterings only requires @xmath64 to vanish and keeps @xmath65 independent . by fitting signal strengths of the higgs ,",
    "the pseudo - scalar coupling @xmath106 and anomalous coupling @xmath71 obviously exhibit deviations to the sm results .",
    "the allowed area of @xmath71 is not noticeably larger when more free parameters are included from cases 1 through 4 .",
    "all cases have shown that there are a abundant parameter space , even if unitarity limit is severely set to arbitrary large energy .",
    "so , the two kinds of cpv from ambiguous cp definition and anomalous couplings can coexist . even under these results",
    "come from an imprecise signal strength , which will be improved at the updated lhc in the near future .",
