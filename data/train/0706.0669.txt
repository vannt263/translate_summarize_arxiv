    "gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most energetic explosions that take place in our universe , with a typical energy of @xmath6 released on a timescale of between a millisecond and a few thousand seconds .",
    "the release of such a considerable amount of energy over such a short period requires an outflow that is relativistic @xcite and is likely to be anisotropic @xcite .",
    "the energy within the outflow is released primarily though shocks .",
    "the grb is thought to be produced through internal shocks from interactions between successive shells of ejecta @xcite .",
    "subsequently an afterglow is emitted as the outflow is decelerated through collisionless shocks with the external medium @xcite .",
    "a forward shock propagates into the external medium and emits from x - ray to radio wavelengths , and a reverse shock travels back through the ejecta and peaks at longer wavelengths than the forward shock @xcite .",
    "the afterglow can reveal many properties of the progenitor and its surroundings .",
    "currently , the most up to date model @xcite allows the use of the temporal and spectral indices to indicate the nature of the surrounding medium , whether it is a uniform density medium , or a medium with a density that is decreasing radially as expected for a stellar wind e.g @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the particle density and @xmath9 is the radius from the grb .",
    "the indices also indicate the location of the observing band relative to the synchrotron self absorption frequency @xmath10 , the peak frequency @xmath11 and cooling frequency @xmath12 .",
    "some grb afterglows have a period of slow decline in their lightcurves ( @xmath13 , where @xmath14 ) @xcite , which is generally accepted to be due to continued energy injection @xcite .",
    "this energy could be due to a central engine that is long lasting @xcite , later shells catching up and colliding with slower shells that were emitted earlier @xcite , or the slow release of energy stored in the form of poynting flux @xcite .",
    "the end of energy injection is signalled by an increase in decay rates of the afterglow lightcurves to @xmath13 , where @xmath15 .",
    "currently the most effective observatory for studying grbs and their early afterglows is _ swift _ , which has now been in operation for over two years .",
    "it has the ability to observe emission ranging from @xmath16-rays to optical with the three on - board telescopes , namely the burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xcite 2005 ) , the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite 2005 ) and the ultra violet and optical telescope ( uvot ; @xcite 2005 ) .",
    "the bat covers a large area of the sky allowing of order 100 bursts to be detected per year .",
    "when the bat has been triggered by the grb , the satellite slews automatically allowing the xrt and the uvot to begin observing as soon as possible , usually within @xmath17 of the burst trigger .",
    "_ swift _ is thus able to observe both the initial @xmath16-ray explosion and the following early afterglow .    this paper looks at grb  050802 , a burst that appears to challenge the standard picture . at the end of the shallow decay",
    "the x - ray afterglow breaks to a steeper decay , while the optical afterglow continues to decay as a power - law without a break .",
    "if both the x - ray and optical arise from the same component and if the x - ray break were due to the end of energy injection then the optical lightcurve would be expected to break at the same time . such behaviour has been noted recently in 6 _ swift _ grb afterglows @xcite of which grb  050802 is currently the best example .",
    "this burst has a x - ray lightcurve with two distinct breaks and it was observed for 1.2@xmath18s .",
    "it also had an optically bright afterglow ( @xmath1916 magnitude at early times ) that was well sampled in 6 filters of the uvot up to 1  @xmath20  s and thereafter observed with the white uvot filter . in this paper",
    "we discuss the possible models that could explain this behaviour .",
    "we will use the convention flux @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 being the temporal and spectral indices respectively .",
    "we assume the hubble parameter @xmath24@xmath25 and density parameters @xmath26=0.7 and @xmath27=0.3 .",
    "uncertainties are quoted at 1@xmath28 unless otherwise stated .",
    "the bat was triggered by grb  050802 at 10:08:02  ut on the @xmath29  august  2005 @xcite .",
    "the lightcurve rises for 5s to the first of three peaks and has a @xmath30s ( 90 % confidence level ) .",
    "the fluence in the @xmath31 band is @xmath32 to @xmath33 confidence level @xcite .",
    "observations with the xrt and uvot began 289s and 286s respectively , after the bat trigger@xcite .",
    "both the xrt and uvot continued to observe until @xmath34 after the burst trigger .",
    "the xrt began observations by locating the burst with image mode ( i m ) .",
    "after the burst was located , data were taken in windowed timing ( wt ) mode for 163s .",
    "a fading uncatalogued source was found within @xmath35 of the bat position @xcite and was confirmed as the x - ray counterpart of grb  050802 .",
    "480s after the burst trigger , the xrt changed modes and continued observations in photon counting ( pc ) mode .",
    "uvot observations showed a fading , uncatalogued source at ra=@xmath36@xmath37@xmath38 , dec=@xmath39@xmath40@xmath41 @xcite . following the trigger ,",
    "a series of automated exposures were taken in the three optical and three ultra - violet filters .",
    "a log of the observations is given in table [ tab : uvotpoints ] .",
    "the observations consisted of an initial 100s ` finding chart ' exposure in the v - band , 10s exposures in each passband for 7 rotations of the filter wheel , followed by a sequence of @xmath42s and @xmath43s exposures .",
    "later observations ( after @xmath44s ) , were taken in the uvot white filter .",
    "the afterglow was also imaged and detected with the 2.6 m shain telescope , 8hrs after the burst , with r and i band magnitudes of 20.6 and 20.2 respectively @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations were carried out with alfosc on the nordic optical telescope .",
    "several absorption features were detected providing a redshift measurement of @xmath45 ( @xcite 2005a @xmath46 2005b ) .",
    "@xcite discovered an extended source within 1  of the uvot afterglow location , which they propose could be the host galaxy .",
    "the xrt data were reduced using the xrt pipeline software v2.0 .",
    "source and background counts were taken from the cleaned event files using extraction regions , in order to construct spectra and lightcurves .",
    "events of grade 0 - 2 were used for the wt mode and 0 - 12 were used for the pc mode . for the wt mode data we used a 40 pixel strip for the source extraction region and a 40 pixel strip for the background extraction region . in the pc mode",
    "data the first 2.5ks of data were found to be piled - up and so required the use of an annular extraction region .",
    "the size of the region that was affected by pile up was determined by comparing the radial profile of the afterglow with a model of the xrt point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the radial profile and the model psf are inconsistent at radii less than 2.5 pixels ( @xmath47 ) , so we used an inner radius of 2.5 pixels and an outer radius of 30 pixels ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the size of the source extraction region for the rest of the pc data was 30 pixel ( @xmath48 ) radius . for all pc data",
    ", background counts were extracted from a circular region of radius 80 pixels ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "appropriate response matrices ( rms ) were taken from the swift calibration database , caldb 20060424 and effective area files were constructed using the standard xrt software . a correction factor was calculated and applied to the piled - up section of the xrt lightcurve to account for the excluded , piled up pixels .",
    "fortunately , the source was not located near the bad pixel columns and so no correction was required .",
    "the uvot event files were screened for bad times ( e.g. south atlantic anomaly passage , earth - limb avoidance ) and the images were corrected for mod-8 noise using the standard uvot software .",
    "the images were transformed to sky coordinates and then corrected for the @xmath50 uncertainty in the aspect of the spacecraft pointing using bespoke software .",
    "counts for the afterglow were extracted using an aperture of radius @xmath51 for the optical filters and @xmath52 for the ultra - violet filters .",
    "background subtraction was performed using counts extracted from a larger region offset from the source position .",
    "the measured count rates were aperture - corrected to radii of @xmath47 for the v , b and u filters and 12@xmath53 for the uv filters .",
    "these were then translated to magnitudes using the standard uvot zero - points ( see table [ tab : uvotpoints ] ) .",
    "the optical lightcurve is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lateopticallc ] .",
    "the lightcurve from each filter of the uvot was normalized to the v filter .",
    "the normalization factor for each filter ( see table [ tab : uvotnorm ] ) was calculated by taking the average count rate through the filter in the 400s-1000s time range , and dividing this value by the average count rate in the v filter over the same time interval .",
    "later observations were obtained with the uvot white filter ; these were normalized to the equivalent v count rates as follows .",
    "the optical - uv spectral energy distribution ( sed ) was modelled using the average count rates from the v , b , u , uvw1 , uvm2 and uvw2 filters in the 400s-1000s time range . the",
    "optical / uv response matrices were then used to predict the ratio of the v to white count rates .",
    "seds were produced spanning the optical to x - ray range for early ( 400s-1000s ) and late ( 35ks-55ks ) times .",
    "for each period , the average count rates of the exposures in each uvot filter were used to produce the optical spectral values . for the x - ray part of each sed a spectrum",
    "was extracted in the relevant time range .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,<,<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in summary , we have determined that the x - ray lightcurve can be divided into 3 segments with two breaks at 420s and 5000s . throughout the afterglow",
    ", there is no evidence for x - ray spectral evolution .",
    "we also find that the optical lightcurve decays as a single power - law , which has a slightly steeper decay than the second segment of the x - ray lightcurve .",
    "we have determined the earliest possible time that the optical lightcurve could have changed its decay rate to match that of the third x - ray segment to be 19ks , which is 14ks after the last x - ray break .    in the following subsections",
    ", we will look in detail at the x - ray afterglow to examine the origin of the x - ray breaks and to determine the best fitting closure relations between the temporal and spectral slopes .",
    "then we shall discuss the question of why the x - ray lightcurve breaks at 5000s while the optical lightcurve continues to decay as a power - law .",
    "several mechanisms will then be investigated to find a compatible model for the production of the x - ray and optical afterglow .",
    "we begin by looking at the first break to see what we may learn .",
    "the break occurs at @xmath54s , which is preceded by a rise from 286s with a slope of -0.80@xmath55 .",
    "the break is then followed by a gradual decay with a slope of @xmath56 .",
    "the rise and the successive slow decay can be regarded as a broad peak in the lightcurve and it may be attributed to ` flaring ' activity @xcite or could be the early phase of the jet interacting with the external medium , giving rise to the forward shock @xcite . however , it is not possible to discriminate between the two mechanisms .",
    "flares often have different spectra to the afterglow , but if this is a flare it may be so small we would not expect to see any spectral variability . on the other hand , we can not tell if this is the early rise of the afterglow as we have too little data prior to the peak . an additional contribution to the second segment from a large flare",
    "may also be excluded as a power - law fit to the x - ray lightcurve between 1000s and 3000s results in a slope of @xmath57 with @xmath58/d.o.f=21/38 .",
    "typically , x - ray afterglows are analysed by applying the closure relations given by @xcite to the x - ray spectral and temporal indices .",
    "these relations are an aid in determining the location of the observed x - ray band relative to the synchrotron frequencies ( @xmath59 ) and the environment in which the the burst occurs .",
    "we skip the first segment of the x - ray lightcurve as the closure relations are not applicable to a lightcurve that is rising .",
    "we begin by applying the simplest non - injected relations to the second segment , in which @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the only closure relation that agrees without the requirement of energy injection at 3@xmath28 confidence level , is @xmath62 this relation applies to a wind or ism medium with @xmath63 , but , this relation is not appropriate for grb  050802 as the value of the energy index @xmath64 , determined through @xmath23=@xmath64/2 is @xmath64=1.78@xmath650.08 .",
    "values of @xmath64@xmath662 require a different set of closure relations provided by @xcite , of which none satisfies the second decay of grb  050802 .",
    "more complex closure relations , which include a third parameter to account for energy injection , are provided by @xcite . in these models",
    "the luminosity is assumed to evolve as l(t)=@xmath67/@xmath68 where @xmath69 is the luminosity index and @xmath70 is the time for the formation of a self - similar solution , which is approximately the deceleration time .",
    "the luminosity index @xmath69 must be @xmath661 for the energy injection to affect the afterglow dynamics .",
    "we found that there are two injected closure relations that are consistent with @xmath2 and @xmath71 .",
    "the first relation is @xmath72 this closure relation is for a wind medium with slow cooling electrons with either @xmath73 or @xmath74 and where @xmath69=@xmath75 .",
    "the second possible energy injected relation is @xmath76 this relation is for a uniform medium with slow cooling electrons with either @xmath77 or @xmath78 and where @xmath69=@xmath79 . for the closure relations given in equations [ equ:3 ] and [ equ:4 ] , @xmath80 and so @xmath81 .    when the closure relations are applied with the indices of the third segment , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 , we find that the most consistent closure relation without energy injection is @xmath84 which is consistent at 3.5@xmath28 confidence .",
    "all other non - injected closure relations are ruled out at a minimum of 4@xmath28 .",
    "equation [ equ:1 ] is for electrons that are slow cooling within the range @xmath11@xmath66@xmath85@xmath66@xmath12 in a wind medium . again",
    "a value for the energy index may be determined though @xmath80 with @xmath64=2.76@xmath30.08 .",
    "generally , the energy index is expected to remain constant throughout the x - ray afterglow , unless it is changed by energy injection @xcite .",
    "therefore , the application of the closure relations to the x - ray temporal and spectral indices suggests that the second segment is energy injected and the third segment is not , and therefore that the break between the second and third segments at @xmath865000s is due to the discontinuation of energy injection . at this point",
    "it is worth pointing out that the second and third segments of grb  050802 are consistent with the second and third segments of the canonical lightcurve presented by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , from the application of the closure relations above we would come to the same physical explanation as @xcite and @xcite for this temporal behaviour : that the break between the two segments corresponds to the end of energy injection .",
    "having looked at the x - ray afterglow in isolation , we will now investigate whether this physical picture is compatible with the observed optical emission .",
    "the standard afterglow is based on the assumption of a single relativistic outflow @xcite and we will begin by considering models of this type before considering multi - component outflows .",
    "we start by considering an afterglow in which the emission in both the x - ray and optical bands is produced predominantly by the forward shock .",
    "if we compare the decay of the optical lightcurve with the segments of the x - ray lightcurve we find that the optical decay is similar , although not identical to , the slow ` energy injected ' decay of the second segment .",
    "this would suggest that the optical lightcurve is also characteristic of an energy - injected afterglow .",
    "since the x - ray lightcurve breaks at 5000s , suggesting the end of energy injection , and the optical lightcurve continues with a shallow decay indicative of energy injection , we first consider the possibility that the electrons responsible for producing the optical emission continue to receive energy while the x - ray emitting electrons do not .",
    "there are two possible mechanisms for continued energy injection .",
    "these are the arrival of additional shells of material at the shock region or the release of energy stored in the form of poynting flux . in the first case , the injected energy changes the fireball dynamics , but can only change the balance of x - ray to optical emission and produce a break in one of the lightcurves if @xmath11 or @xmath12 pass through one of these bands .",
    "however , we can rule out the passage of one of these breaks through the x - ray or optical afterglow because there is no break in the optical lightcurve and there is no change in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "this therefore rules out continued energy in the form of blast waves and so we consider continued energy injection in the form of poynting flux .",
    "energy is supplied in the form of poynting flux when there is a rotating compact object that has a magnetic field , @xmath87 .",
    "the flux is converted to kinetic energy when kink instabilities cause the magnetic field lines to reconnect in the outflow @xcite .",
    "the energy density of poynting flux is @xmath88 , and within the reconnection region the energy available per particle for particle acceleration is @xmath89 @xcite . to decrease the photon energy",
    "so that further emission is below the x - ray band , requires a decrease of the average particle energy .",
    "the xrt is sensitive over more than a decade in photon energy , therefore a decrease in the average photon energy from above the xrt energy band to below the xrt energy band requires a factor @xmath9010 change in @xmath87 and therefore a factor of @xmath91 change in the energy density of poynting flux @xcite .",
    "this implies a large change in the overall rate of energy injection , which is inconsistent with the continued power - law decay in the optical .",
    "a reverse shock is an alternative means for producing optical emission without x - ray emission and so we now examine the possibility that this could sustain the optical emission of grb  050802 after the x - ray lightcurve has broken .",
    "the reverse shock will travel back through the ejected matter and will emit as long as it is passing through ejecta .",
    "the reverse shock emission will cease when it passes over the last ejected shell @xcite .",
    "the shock crossing time is expected to be approximately the duration of the grb , but if energy continues to be injected into the afterglow by the arrival of further shells the reverse shock may continue for as long as the energy injection phase . if the end of energy injection occurs at 5000s , as suggested by the x - ray lightcurve , then we should expect that the reverse shock must cease at approximately 5000s .",
    "therefore , this is not the required mechanism as the optical lightcurve has no break until at least 19ks .",
    "@xcite have proposed that it is possible to sustain a power - law decay in the optical , while the x - ray lightcurve shows a break due to the end of energy injection , if the microphysical parameters are changing with time .",
    "the microphysical parameters that must change to keep the optical temporal decay as a power - law are : the fraction of post - shock energy in the magnetic fields @xmath92 , the fraction of post - shock energy that is given to electrons @xmath93 and the blast - wave kinetic energy e @xcite .",
    "these parameters are expected to evolve with lorentz factor @xmath94 , if they evolve at all . in the scenario proposed by @xcite",
    ", the cooling frequency @xmath12 lies between the optical and x - ray bands . in this case",
    ", there should be a slope change of @xmath95 between the x - ray and optical bands and @xmath12 moves to lower frequencies with time @xcite .",
    "for grb  050802 , through the fitting of a broken power - law with a fixed @xmath95 to the 400s-1000s sed ( see section 4.2 ) , the maximum energy , at which a break could be present , was determined to be 0.02kev .",
    "we examined the optical to x - ray seds to see if the x - ray and optical lightcurves can be explained by @xmath12 moving to lower frequencies with time as expected in the model of @xcite . in this model the largest change in the ratio @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the x - ray count rate and @xmath98 is the v band count rate corresponds to the motion of @xmath12 from its highest allowed value to below the optical pass band , at which point the optical emission lies on the same power - law spectral segment as the x - ray emission . in the broken power - law fit to the 400s-1000s sed , the highest allowed value of @xmath12 at 3@xmath28 confidence is 0.06kev .",
    "therefore we refited the 400s-1000s sed with @xmath12 fixed at 0.06kev , then reduced the value of @xmath12 to below the uvot spectral range and so determined that the smallest @xmath96 value allowed by this model is @xmath99 .",
    "the observed range of @xmath96 extends to much lower values than this ( fig .",
    "[ fig : opticalxrayratio ] ) .",
    "we find that the weighted mean of the data points more than @xmath100ks after the bat trigger is @xmath101 , which is @xmath102 below the lowest allowed value of @xmath99 , thus allowing the model of @xcite to be ruled out .",
    "we now look in to the optical to x - ray sed further and ask : to what extent can single component models be ruled out completely ? as discussed in section 4.2 , a power - law fit to the late time ( 35ks-55ks ) sed provides a poor fit and the best fit value of @xmath23 is softer than the x - ray spectral index for segment 3 , which includes the 35ks-55ks time interval . in this respect ,",
    "we note that there is no evidence for any evolution in the x - ray spectral index at any point in the afterglow and the weighted mean of the indices found in the 3 segments of the x - ray lightcurve gives @xmath23=0.88@xmath30.03 .",
    "to see why the fit to the late time sed is poor we show the x - ray spectrum extrapolated to lower energies using this spectral slope ( @xmath23=0.88 ) as a dashed line in both panels of fig [ fig : sedearly ] .",
    "the dashed line lies above the optical and uv data points as expected for an afterglow with significant extinction . in section 4.2",
    ", we determined that at @xmath103 confidence , the host galaxy extinction is greater than 0.8 and 1.1 in the b and u bands respectively , no matter which models we choose for the extinction and continuum .",
    "in addition , the galactic extinction is 0.1 for both the b and the u bands .",
    "after correction for extinction , the b and u band fluxes in the late time sed lie significantly above the dashed line .",
    "as described in section 4.2 , this power - law can be ruled out with @xmath9099 per cent confidence , implying at 99 per cent confidence that the region responsible for the x - ray emission can not produce all of the optical emission at late times , no matter where @xmath12 and @xmath11 lie . since single component outflows are unable to represent the late time sed satisfactorily , we now consider multi - component outflows to see which of these models are able to reproduce the observed lightcurves and seds .",
    "a multi - component outflow is one consisting of two or more components that have different bulk lorentz factors .",
    "the simplest model is one of two components : a narrow jet and a second wider , but slower jet that surrounds the narrow component .",
    "this geometry may be generated by the narrow jet giving rise to a wider and slower component @xcite , where the bulk @xmath94 decreases over time and produces a jet with angular structure .",
    "alternatively , the two components may be formed at the same time for example when neutrons and protons decouple in a neutron - rich , hydroydynamically accelerated jet from a neutron star or from the neutron - rich accretion disk of a collapsed massive star @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that within such a neutron - rich jet , the wide component has greater energy than the narrow component so that the wider component is able to dominate at late times . in both cases , the narrow component will produce the x - ray emission , whereas the optical emission will be produced by the wider component as it travels at lower lorentz factors than the narrow component .",
    "this picture can be used to explain bursts such as grb  021004 and grb  030329 @xcite .",
    "the wider jet is expected to reach the undisturbed medium at a slightly later time than the narrow jet .",
    "thus , the wide component may be observed as a later start for the optical lightcurve when compared to the x - ray lightcurve , or on an established optical lightcurve , the arrival of the wide jet to the external medium may be shown as a late rise / bump or a change in the decay slope .",
    "there are three options within a two - component jet we will investigate to see if one could have produced the observed lightcurves of grb  050802 .",
    "all of these options involve energy injection , which is introduced through shells of material .",
    "the options are : energy injection with the ejected shells wide enough to refresh both components of the jet with a lorentz factor that decreases over time ( so that after 5000s the shells no longer reach the shock in the narrow component ) , the cessation of energy injection at 5000s in one component only and , finally , the continuation of energy injection for the duration of the afterglow , but with the narrow component producing a jet break at 5000s .",
    "the first option is that energy injection is distributed uniformly throughout both jets and continues for a sustained period of time .",
    "initially , the shells have a wide enough angular distribution , and travel at a @xmath94 large enough , to reach the forward shock produced by both components .",
    "both the x - ray and the optical afterglows will appear energy injected .",
    "as time goes by , the lorentz factor of the freshly ejected shells decreases .",
    "eventually , the ejected shells will not travel at a lorentz factor large enough to reach the shocked region in the narrow component , but will still be able to reach the wide component .",
    "this will cause a break to be seen only in the x - ray afterglow .",
    "however , the freshly ejected shells will still travel at @xmath94 large enough to reach the wide component and therefore the optical lightcurve will continue to appear energy injected .",
    "this much appears to be consistent with the data because , as discussed in section 5.2 , the optical lightcurve appears to be energy injected for its entire observed duration and does not break with the x - ray lightcurve .",
    "however , as the wide component is slower than the narrow component , the wide component will absorb shells ( i.e receive energy ) at a faster rate than the narrow component .",
    "therefore , the optical emission is expected to decay less rapidly than the x - ray emission . for grb  050802 , the opposite is actually observed : in the optical the decay index @xmath104 , while the x - ray second segment has a decay index of @xmath60 , thus this model is excluded .",
    "the second option calls for the x - ray break at 5000s to have been caused by the cessation of energy injection in the narrow component , while injection continues in the wide component .",
    "however , this implies that the energy is injected as a hollow jet at late times and we consider this to be an unattractive solution on physical grounds , and lacking in testable predictions .",
    "the third option is that energy is continuously injected into both components and the x - ray break at 5000s results from a jet break of the narrow component @xcite .",
    "the spectral indices of the x - ray segments support this model as there is no spectral change over the break , as is expected for a jet break .",
    "a jet break may be produced within a laterally expanding or a non - expanding jet .",
    "the closure relations for these cases are provided by @xcite . in order for this scenario to be viable we have to find a post jet - break closure relation that has consistent energy injection , external medium , synchrotron frequencies and electron spectral index to that of the pre jet - break closure relation . the closure relation that satisfies this uses eq 35 of @xcite , and is : @xmath105 this relation is independent of the grb host medium and is for a laterally expanding jet with @xmath106 .",
    "the relation provides a value of @xmath69=@xmath107 , which is consistent at the 99 per cent confidence level with the value of @xmath69 obtained through the closure relation in equation [ equ:4 ] .",
    "the consistency with equation [ equ:4 ] implies that this burst originated in a uniform ism and not a wind medium as suggested in section 5.1 .",
    "furthermore , we can use the second x - ray break time to infer the opening angle of the narrow beam and to put a lower limit on the angle of the wide component .",
    "we calculated the angles using the following expression from @xcite : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the isotropic energy of the burst , @xmath8 is the density of the medium and @xmath110 is the efficiency of converting energy in the ejecta into @xmath16-rays .",
    "we use values of @xmath111=0.2@xmath112ergs ( in the range 15 - 350 kev ) and grb efficiency @xmath110=0.2 . approximating the circumburst medium as a spherical , uniform gas cloud of radius @xmath113 , the particle density @xmath8 ,",
    "may be estimated simply as @xmath114 . the cloud radius for gas and dust to survive the grb ,",
    "may be estimated using fig .",
    "8 of @xcite .",
    "this shows that the obscuring medium must extend to @xmath115 cm , implying a number density of @xmath11630 @xmath117 .",
    "thus , the value for the narrow component is estimated to be @xmath118 and for the wide component the opening angle is @xmath119 .",
    "we recognise that these angles are only approximate because they depend weakly on the bolometric energy , the efficiency of the burst and on the particle density of the external medium .",
    "this model requires that energy be continually injected into both components of the jet for the observed duration of the burst .",
    "the time scale over which this energy injection takes place is more than an order of magnitude larger than @xmath120s , which is the duration of energy injection required to explain the canonical x - ray afterglow @xcite .",
    "this situation may seem unusual , but grb  050802 is not the first burst that has required discrete or continuous energy injection for an extended period .",
    "a few examples of bursts that have required long duration energy injection are grb  021004 , xrf  050406 and grb  060729 @xcite .",
    "the continuation of energy injection well beyond the jet break time will produce shallower post jet break slopes than the non - injected case and these may be mistaken for the discontinuation of energy injection .",
    "this would lead to the surprisingly small number of reported jet breaks in the _ swift _ era @xcite .",
    "however , the mechanism that could be responsible for long duration ( @xmath121s ) energy injection is uncertain .",
    "currently , the most favoured scenario is one in which the duration of the central engine is short , but where the ejecta are emitted with shells of varying velocities @xcite .",
    "the shells will order themselves before reaching the external medium and will form a continuous flow of shells . in this case , small time scale fluctuations need not be observed in the power - law lightcurves and the central engine is not required to be particularly long lived .",
    "this model would allow the break to occur only in the x - ray lightcurve because the narrow and wide components travel at different @xmath94 , and the narrow component is beamed into a smaller angle .",
    "therefore , the two component outflow with continued energy injection and a jet break in the narrow component is our favoured hypothesis for producing the observed lightcurve of grb  050802 .",
    "the result from this paper has wider implications for our understanding of grbs .",
    "segments two and three of the x - ray lightcurve of grb  050802 have the same characteristics as the segments two and three of the canonical x - ray afterglow lightcurve @xcite .",
    "if we had looked at the x - ray data alone , then our explanation for the second and third x - ray segments of grb  050802 would have been equivalent to the explanation proposed by @xcite and @xcite for the canonical lightcurve : an energy injected decay followed by a ` normal ' decay . however , when the optical observations are taken into account , this explanation is no longer attractive . instead , a more plausible explanation is a two component outflow with the break in the x - ray lightcurve likely to be due to a jet break .",
    "our results suggest that without the optical lightcurve the interpretation of grb afterglows may not be correct .",
    "this paper has investigated grb  050802 , an unusual burst because the optical decays as a power - law , while the x - ray breaks twice .",
    "we have analysed optical and x - ray data gathered from the xrt and uvot instruments onboard _",
    "swift_. observations continued with both the xrt and the uvot up until 1.2@xmath122s .",
    "the analysis of the afterglow began by looking at the origin of the three power - law segments in the x - ray lightcurve .",
    "the x - ray lightcurve commences with a rise until 420s .",
    "the second segment decays slowly with @xmath2=0.63@xmath30.03 until 5000s .",
    "the third and last segment decays faster with a slope of @xmath4=1.59@xmath30.03 .",
    "the optical lightcurve decays as a single power - law with @xmath123=0.82@xmath30.03 .    through modelling of the 400s-1000s x - ray to optical sed",
    ", it was determined that the best fit is a power - law with milky way extinction . however ,",
    "when extinction in the host galaxy is accounted for , the optical points lie above the x - ray power - law at late times , indicating that the optical afterglow could not be produced by the same component as the x - ray emission .",
    "this result rules out single component afterglows with 99 per cent confidence .",
    "the next logical step was to examine a multi - component outflow .",
    "several variations of a two component jet , the simplest multi - component outflow , were investigated .",
    "of all the possibilities , we find the most physically self - consistent model is one in which both a narrow and wide component are energy injected for the duration of the observed afterglow and the x - ray break at 5000s is due to a jet break in the narrow component .",
    "this paper has wide implications for the grb community .",
    "we have found that the explanation obtained by examining only the x - ray data of grb  050802 differs remarkably from the answer obtained by examining the optical and x - ray emission together .",
    "our results suggest that without the optical lightcurve the correct interpretation of grb afterglows may not be possible .",
