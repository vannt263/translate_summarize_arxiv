    "relativistic shells have found applications in an impressive list of different scenarios , such as sources of vacuum gravitational fields @xcite-@xcite , cosmological models @xcite and @xcite , gravitational collapse @xcite , canonical quantization of gravity @xcite and @xcite , higher dimensional models in brane world , quantum gravitational collapse @xcite , entropy of black holes , motion of thin clouds surrounding an exploding star @xcite , sources of  phantom \" fields and dark energy @xcite . in spite of the wide range of their applications , very few analytical solutions in closed form are known even in spherical symmetry .",
    "exceptions are the dust ( i.e. zero pressure ) shells , which were completely analyzed already in the pioneering work by israel @xcite , @xcite , and solutions with linear - barotropic equations of state of the form @xmath0 with a constant @xmath1 . in the present paper",
    "we discuss the general exact solution for shells satisfying an equation of state in closed form @xmath2 with some general assumption of physical reasonableness on the behavior of the function @xmath3 .",
    "our solutions include as particular cases the linear e.o.s .",
    "cited above but also , for instance , non - linear polytropic equations of state of the form @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the qualitative behavior of spherical shells always presents two  branches \" , an ",
    "astro - physically relevant \" branch in which the weak energy condition is strictly satisfied , and a  phantom \" branch in which the density remains positive but the active gravitational mass @xmath5 is strictly negative .",
    "we consider a spherical shell in vacuum .",
    "the shell  separates \" a portion of minkowski space (  interior \" ) from schwarzschild space of arbitrarily fixed mass parameter @xmath6 (  exterior \" ) .",
    "the field equations relate the jump of the exterior curvature with the matter content of the shell , i.e. a surface distribution of stress - energy .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that such equations can be written as follows : @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the  radius \" of the shell as a function of the proper time on the shell , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the surface ( rest - frame ) energy - density and the surface pressure ( due to spherical symmetry , the two eigenvalues of the stress are equal , i.e. the material is necessarily a  two - dimensional perfect fluid \" ) and the  effective potential \" @xmath12 is given by @xmath13    the equations ( [ conser ] ) and ( [ rpunto ] ) contain three unknowns , and become a closed set once a further relation has been given .",
    "this has been achieved in various ways in the literature ; for instance , one can assign the pressure profile as a  a priori \" known function @xcite and calculate the corresponding density profile .",
    "however , in this way , the resulting  equation of state \" , i.e. the relationship between density and pressure which holds during the dynamics may turn out to be unphysical . here",
    ", we are going to consider the case of a closed equation of state of the barotropic type , namely @xmath14 . in this case , as we shall see , the equations above decouple and the dynamics can be qualitatively analyzed .",
    "the function @xmath15 has to satisfy a certain set of assumptions which assure the physical reasonability of the model .",
    "it seems that a reasonable compromise between generality and physical reasonableness can be obtained assuming that @xmath16 is a continuous , monotonic function , differentiable except perhaps at @xmath17 , where its value vanishes .",
    "these assumptions comprise a wide range of equations of state and , in particular , the linear - barotropic ( @xmath18 with a constant @xmath19 ) that has been widely studied in the literature @xcite , @xcite , and the polytropic case @xmath20 ( both these e.o.s .",
    "reduce to the newtonian polytropes in the weak field regime @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "if the weak energy condition is required , then solutions have to be selected in such a way that @xmath21 , and on such solutions the effective gravitational mass @xmath22 must be non negative",
    ". therefore the requirement @xmath23 has to be added .",
    "however , shells with positive density but negative effective mass are of interest on their own , for instance as toy models for sources of dark energy ( `` phantom '' fields , see e.g. @xcite , exotic matter and wormholes , see @xcite ) , thus we shall consider also this possibility in what follows .",
    "we take initial data @xmath24 and consider the behavior of the solutions of the ordinary differential equation @xmath25    first of all , we notice that it can be reduced to a quadrature @xmath26    thus , if the function @xmath27 is integrable in neighborhood of @xmath28 , the density diverges then this occurs at a finite non zero value @xmath29 ( with @xmath30 ) (  case a \" ) . if instead the function @xmath27 is not integrable in neighborhood of @xmath28 , the density can diverge only as @xmath31 approaches zero (  case b \" ) .",
    "further , a straightforward analysis shows that the following cases have to be distinguished : + case i ) : @xmath32 for any @xmath10 :    in this case each solution is strictly decreasing from @xmath28 to zero ( one among behaviors a or b occurs ) .",
    "weak energy condition is always satisfied .",
    "since @xmath17 is a solution , if @xmath33 is continuous in @xmath17 the standard uniqueness theorem for ode gives @xmath34 as @xmath35 .",
    "for completeness we notice , however , that one could also conceive models in which @xmath33 has a finite jump in @xmath17 . in this case",
    "a loss of uniqueness occurs at a finite value @xmath36 ( at which the solution goes to zero and can be prolonged to be zero , thus giving a sort of  evaporation \" of the shell ) .",
    "we thus have four qualitatively different cases reported in figures 1 - 4 .",
    "+ case ii ) : there exist a zero ( at @xmath37 ) of the function @xmath38 :    clearly @xmath39 is a regular solution at which no loss of uniqueness can occur .",
    "thus the behavior depends on the initial datum for @xmath10 :    ( iia ) if @xmath40 then all solutions are strictly decreasing and approach from above @xmath37 as @xmath35 ; one among cases a and b occurs .",
    "weak energy condition is satisfied everywhere .",
    "( iib ) if @xmath41 then all solutions are strictly increasing and approach @xmath37 from below as @xmath35 ; their behavior  in the past \" intersects @xmath17 where a loss of uniqueness occurs .",
    "weak energy condition is violated everywhere because the density is positive but @xmath42 is strictly negative .",
    "two behaviors must still be distinguished : if the derivative @xmath43 has no zeroes , the solutions come out from zero with infinite tangent , if it has a zero the solutions have a flex point , and the matching at @xmath17 is smooth in this case .",
    "all in all we have the four qualitatively different cases reported in figures 5 - 8 .",
    "once the behavior of the energy function @xmath44 is known the corresponding qualitative behavior of the shell radius @xmath9 can be read off from the  effective potential \" equation ( [ rpunto ] ) .",
    "first of all , we notice that , due to the presence of the @xmath45 term , the potential always diverges at the left end side of the interval of definition , in all the eight qualitatively different cases discussed above .",
    "the behavior at the other extreme is divergent as well in the cases i without loss of uniqueness and in all cases ii ( where @xmath12 diverges as @xmath31 goes to infinity ) .",
    "thus in all such cases the potential is a continuous curve positively diverging at the extremes , and it follows that it has an absolute minimum .",
    "the dynamics is allowed in both the neighborhoods of the extremes , and it is allowed everywhere if @xmath12 is positive at the minimum .",
    "bouncing or also oscillating behaviors can appear as well , if the minimum is negative and therefore there is at least one region in which the dynamics is not allowed .",
    "shells with general equation of state can thus be viewed as very useful ",
    "toy \" models for astrophysical objects , in order to investigate the effect of the equation of state on the dynamics in several physically interesting scenarios .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
