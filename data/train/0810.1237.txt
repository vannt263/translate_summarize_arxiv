    "in the last decades , _ synchronization _ of chaotic dynamics became a subject that has attracted of lot of attention book , fujisaka , pikovsky1,pikovsky2,grassberger , pecora , carroll .",
    "in fact , from a theoretical point of view , this phenomenon seems to contradict the inheriting sensibility to initial conditions of chaotic dynamics . on the other hand ,",
    "the interest in this kind of phenomenon comes from the possibility of using the unpredictable chaotic trajectories as a carrier signal in communication channels . in this context , high dimensional systems with multiple positive lyapunov exponents , i.e. , _ hyperchaotic dynamics _",
    "@xcite , have been proposed as a resource for improving the security in the communication schemes .",
    "synchronization of hyperchaotic systems has therefore also become an area of active research kocarev , peng , lair , ali , parker .",
    "chaotic dynamics described by differential delay equations arise in the description of many different kind of situations , such as physiology mackey , foss , biology @xcite , economy @xcite , laser physics @xcite , etc .",
    "as is well known , a high dimensional chaotic attractor characterizes these infinite dimensional systems .",
    "it has been shown that the lyapunov dimension of the attractor is proportional to the characteristic delay time of the dynamics gibbs , farmer , procaccia , berrer .",
    "therefore , _ _ synchronization of hyperchaotic nonlinear delay dynamics__has also been extensively explored from both a theoretical point of view as well as a resource for communication schemes @xcite .",
    "a new aspect introduced in this case is the possibility of synchronizing two chaotic dynamics with a time shift , giving rise to the phenomenon of anticipated voss1,voss2,voss3,pyragas , masoller , zanette , mirasso , tang , toral , shore , heil ( or retarded ) synchronization , i.e. , one of the chaotic systems ( slave or receiver system ) follows the chaotic trajectory of the other one ( master or transmitter system ) with an advanced ( or retarded ) time shift .    in any real experimental setup",
    "where chaotic synchronization is observed one is naturally confronted with two undesirable effects that avoid reaching a perfectly synchronized regime .",
    "the characteristic parameters of both systems are not exactly the same , small _ parameter mismatch _ may induce clearly observable effects @xcite . also , departure with respect to the perfectly synchronized manifold may also be due to intrinsic _ _  noise fluctuations _ _ present in both systems @xcite .",
    "both effects have been analyzed in the literature .",
    "nevertheless , due to the chaotic character of the dynamics , in general it is hard to obtain an analytical estimation of these effects , which in fact may depend on the specific nature of the chaotic systems as well as on the coupling scheme used to achieve synchronization .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a simple analytical description of the phenomenon of synchronization of hyperchaotic delay dynamics , considering realistic situations such as the presence of parameter mismatch as well as the presence of intrinsic noise fluctuations in both synchronized systems .",
    "we demonstrate that this goal can be achieved when the synchronized dynamics are in a _ fully - developed chaos regime _ @xcite .",
    "in this situation , the corresponding chaotic attractor does not have any stable periodic orbit and its basin of attraction fills out almost the whole available domain .",
    "these properties suggest that the nonlinear delay contribution terms of the chaotic dynamics may be statistically equivalent to an ergodic noise source . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , this property , in a long time limit and depending on the characteristic parameter values , is in fact valid for a broad class of scalar delay dynamics .",
    "therefore , our _ main idea _ consists in replacing the full set of coupled delay chaotic evolutions that lead to synchronization by a set of _ correlated langevin evolutions _ obtained from the original chaotic ones after replacing the nonlinear delay contributions by a noise term .",
    "since the final langevin equations are linear , their statistical properties can be obtained in an exact analytical way , providing a simple framework for characterizing the synchronization phenomenon .",
    "departure with respect to perfect synchronization is characterized in terms of a _ similarity function _",
    "@xcite , which measures the degree of correlation between the quasi - synchronized dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
