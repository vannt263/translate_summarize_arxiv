    "the study of numerical methods of quantum mechanics has become an exciting and increasingly active field of research , not only because numerical methods are extremely important as simulation instruments , but also because they help understand the underlying functioning of the quantum theory .",
    "such is the case of density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) , which has played an important role in this sense since its inception .",
    "time evolving block decimation ( tebd ) has appeared more recently and integrates elements of dmrg with concepts of quantum computation .",
    "both dmrg and tebd have inspired a number of variants such as tdmrg , itebd , mps , mera and peps , to mention just a few @xcite .",
    "however , there exist instances where the lack of efficient simulation protocols is yet an issue . here , a proposal in this direction is explored , namely , a method that can be used to simulate real as well as imaginary quantum evolution under more relaxed conditions than those encountered in standard tebd applications .",
    "this paper expands on the themes first addressed in reference @xcite , and can be seen as its continuation , especially in what concerns to the inclusion of interaction and the treatment of non - unitary transformations .",
    "many of the efforts devoted during recent times to the study of efficient simulation options have been motivated by the remarkable advancement in cold atom experiments and the possibility of probing fundamental theoretical models in the laboratory @xcite . as a result , applications of numerical methods based on tensor states are getting increasingly common in descriptions of quantum gases in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "tensor states display an assortment of properties that can be exploited to absorb symmetries and implement transformations selectively rather that on the whole hilbert space @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the present work tensor states are used as a tool that allow to put in practice the design outlined throughout the analysis that follows .",
    "let us introduce the bose - hubbard hamiltonian in one dimension as follows @xmath0 being @xmath1 , while @xmath2 and @xmath3 satisfy @xmath4=\\delta_j^k$ ] and @xmath5=0 $ ] for @xmath6 .",
    "operators @xmath2 and @xmath7 represent the @xmath8th mode .",
    "if these modes are associated to wannier functions with no significant overlap in position @xcite , as it is normally the case in applications of the bose - hubbard model , then @xmath8 numbers a site in a quantum chain . in order to allow for benchmarking against tebd ,",
    "open boundary conditions are embraced , @xmath9 , yet the validity of the central arguments here is not tied to such a specific kind of boundary conditions . moreover ,",
    "periodic boundary conditions were used in @xcite .",
    "the bose - hubbard model undergoes a continuous phase transition from mott insulator to superfluid and its phase diagram as well as its phenomenology has been worked out in various contributions @xcite .",
    "+ the standard version of tebd makes use of the trotter - suzuki expansion ( tse ) @xcite to decompose the evolution operator as a product of transformations involving only nearest neighbor sites .",
    "this is done by splitting the evolution operator in two sub - evolutions , each generated by a part of the hamiltonian grouping every other term of the sum in ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "the approach is efficacious , but it delimits the spectrum of applications to hamiltonians with nearest - neighbor hopping or interaction , and open boundary conditions too . here",
    "it is proposed to separate the hamiltonian into single - particle and many - particle operators , such as they are understood from a second - quantization perspective , and then write the evolution operator as a composition of infinitesimal evolutions for each part .",
    "a second order split can thus be considered as follows @xmath10 knowing that @xmath11 the only request being that the terms appearing in @xmath12 , i.e. , the interaction , must be local , but @xmath13 can take any form as long as it remains single - body . under the action of single - particle transformations",
    ", it is known that the mode operators inherit the properties normally assigned to states and in particular a form of linearity that in turn induces a form of unitariety which governs the coefficients of the mode operators .",
    "it is this unitariety that will be important for the development of the current proposal and should be differentiated from the most common and general notion of unitariety .    independently of the formulation of the exponential split , the simulation protocols that have relevance in this study",
    "employ the tensorial representation and the updating routines for one- and two - site transformations on a quantum chain that were first introduced in @xcite . in coherence to this",
    ", the cost of a given computation is reported by the variable @xmath14 , which establishes , in the shape of a polynomial , the maximum number of arithmetic operations necessary to calculate the action of an operator on at most two consecutive sites of the chain .",
    "it will be seen that all these elements play a role in the conception and testing of the methodologies that are the focus of this review .    in the next section",
    "the fundamentals of the technique , here referred to in general as mode folding ( mf ) , are explained .",
    "then it is seen how interaction is incorporated and how the whole proposal performs against characteristic parameters and in comparison to tse .",
    "subsequently , it is shown how to work with non - unitary transformations and the particularities found in the calculation of ground states .",
    "it is pointed out that different versions of the proposal can be used together in cases where ground state and evolution are both required , such as in studies of quench dynamics .",
    "alternative approaches and conclusions are presented in the last part .",
    "a solution of the schrodinger equation for a system of identical particles is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "@xmath18 is the number of modes and @xmath19 is the total number of particles .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) that @xmath20 .",
    "if only single - particle transformations are considered ( @xmath21 ) , then the evolution modes behave linearly ( for the sake of clarity , time dependencies are stressed in some of the subsequent expressions )    @xmath22    the coefficients in this expression depend essentially on @xmath13 through a closed system of dynamical equations .",
    "unitary operations on @xmath23 can be seen as transformations that act simultaneously on every @xmath24 .",
    "there are two types of such transformations that have applications in the folding method .",
    "the first one affects mode operators individually and is used to make the coefficients real .",
    "such an effect is achieved by implementing the inverse of @xmath25}(t ) = e^ { i \\phi_{l , k}(t ) \\hat{a}_l^{\\dagger } \\hat{a}_l } , \\text { } \\phi_{l , k}(t ) = \\arg c_{l , k } ( t ) , \\label{eq:7}\\ ] ] getting as a result @xmath26 . when this is done consecutively for @xmath27 only real coefficients",
    "are left in the equivalent of eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) with @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath29 s can then be redefined as the absolute values of the original coefficients .",

    "\\label{eq:12}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the fact that the change on the coefficients is unitary is pivotal to the ensuing discussion .",
    "after making @xmath32 it follows @xmath33 as a result , operator @xmath34 is neutralized in @xmath24 . in order to see the complete action of these operations , let us propose a view in which the evolved modes appear stacked as shown by ( [ eq:14 ] ) .",
    "transformations affect all the coefficients vertically aligned .",
    "in the first part of the proposed protocol , all the coefficients in the first row of the stack , i.e. , those belonging to @xmath35 , are stripped from their complex phases employing transformations of the first kind .",
    "notice that once this has been completed , all the coefficients in the stack have most likely changed , not just the ones in the first row .",
    "the next step consists in making @xmath36 disappear from the first row by operating on the two columns at the left of the stack , as indicated in ( [ eq:14 ] ) , and then making @xmath37 .",
    "this cancellation technique is repeated systematically , advancing toward the right , until all the operators except @xmath38 are eliminated from the first row , as indicated by ( [ eq:15 ] ) and ( [ eq:16 ] ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that the last of these operations entails the cancellation of all but the top @xmath38 in the column at the right extreme of the stack , by virtue of the unitariety of all previous transformations and the fact that the modes are orthonormal . at the end of this first series ( or layer ) of changes ,",
    "the first mode has been folded and the stack of operators appears just like ( [ eq:17 ] ) .",
    "the second layer of operations is aimed at folding the second mode and has a very similar structure , but it is carried without reaching the first mode , lest it unfolds .",
    "the scheme goes on in an orderly manner until the stack is left with a different operator in every level . at this point",

    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , into single - particle and many - particle step evolutions .",
    "the tensorial representation of the state is obtained applying the unitary transformations related to mf , which account for the single - particle step , as well as the many - particle step using the updating protocols demonstrated in ref .",

    "the following error measure is introduced @xmath48 , where @xmath49 comes from a tensorial representation and @xmath50 from a standard matricial analysis .",
    "it can be seen in figure [ fig1](a ) that different versions of mf produce results with distinct accuracies .",
    "it can also be seen that the best estimation is given by the inverse mf , although the difference with the next best estimation is rather marginal .",
    "the observed optimal parameter is @xmath51 , but in general the appropriate @xmath47 depends on the distribution of coefficients in ( [ eq:14 ] ) . for small values of @xmath45",
    "the distribution is tight and the optimal @xmath47 is short .",
    "likewise , @xmath47 should grow with increasing @xmath45 .",
    "it is empirically seen that the best performance is achieved when the smallest considered coefficient is approximately of the same order of magnitude than the square root of machine accuracy .",
    "the reduction in correctness observed when more coefficients are included occurs because substantial error is transmitted to some folding angles calculated using coefficients with an insufficient number of significant figures at the beginning of each layer of calculations .",
    "contrariwise , no such a tendency is observed in the inverse scheme since , even though poorly estimated coefficients are retained , the folding routine starts by the biggest coefficients on each layer .",
    "this makes inverse mf reliable , although it requires the inclusion of all the folding operations .",
    "normal folding taking less coefficients is numerically more efficient , but a little bit less exact .",
    "figures [ fig1](b ) and [ fig1](c ) show the characteristic behavior of the error as a function of time for different values of the time slice .",
    "for relatively large @xmath45 , @xmath52 s growth is essentially polynomial . as @xmath45 diminishes , the corresponding error curves scale down until for an optimal time slice the error starts showing saturation . as @xmath45",
    "diminishes further , the error scales up but the saturation profile remains .",
    "it can therefore be argued that while the theoretical error is gradually suppressed with decreasing @xmath45 , the computing error caused by division by small numbers augments .",
    "similarly , the optimal value @xmath53 seems to be independent of the values given to @xmath47 and @xmath45 .",
    "however , the dependence of the error with respect to @xmath14 is rather characteristic . making @xmath14 slightly smaller than its optimal value produces exponentially growing deviations from the actual state at very early times .",
    "this contrasts with the behavior of @xmath52 in simulations where although the time slice has been chosen well above its optimal value , @xmath14 has remained at or above its equilibrium value . in such cases",
    "the error growth is polynomial and the simulation can be sustained for quite longer intervals . in this sense",
    "it can be said that a right estimation of @xmath14 is more important for numerics than the chosen @xmath45 .",
    "this feature is encountered in both mf and tse simulations .",
    "the comparative graphs depicted in figures [ fig1](d ) and [ fig1](e ) suggest that the difference in terms of deviations from the correct state between mf and tse is minimal over a wide range of values of the ratio @xmath54 .",
    "since it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that folding alone delivers results with a tolerance of the order of machine accuracy , it follows that the observed error is mostly due to the splitting of the evolution operator into single- and many particle parts and that such an error is comparable to the one produced by tse . in terms of efficiency , because both approaches seem to require the same @xmath14 , the determinant factor is the number of transformations effectuated on pairs of modes per loop in a computer routine , i.e. , the number of updates of the tensorial representation necessary to advance the state a time @xmath45 . in a second order version",
    "such a number is approximately @xmath55 for tse and @xmath56 for mf .",
    "the difference can be understood in terms of the cost associated to the inclusion of more hopping terms in mf , in contrast to the less - strict neighbor approach dictated by tse .",
    "ground states play a prominent role in the study of quantum systems and it is known that they usually display less entanglement than dynamical states . as a consequence ,",
    "the associated simulation cost in terms of tensor states is manageable to a great extent .",
    "simulation protocols that rely on mps can be formulated as variational methods .",
    "this is the case of dmrg , where the ground state is found as the network that minimizes the energy .",
    "another approach is to realize the limit @xmath57 as an iteration of an infinitesimal imaginary - time evolution of length @xmath58 .",
    "such is the strategy followed in the context of tebd and it is also the approach adopted here .",
    "the crux of the problem is that imaginary - time evolutions are not unitary , ergo the foundation of the mps updating method @xcite and the folding technique is compromised . to deal with the issue it is important , on the one hand , to use a sufficiently small `` imaginary '' time slice @xmath58 , so that the corresponding advancement is close enough to unitary and the updating protocols work . on the other hand ,",
    "it is necessary to find a folding protocol that is not as heavily dependent on the unitariety of the evolution operation .",

    "is the fact that , as long as @xmath14 is optimal , the symmetry of the state is correctly reproduced by the folding method in spite of the relatively large number of operations correlating modes that are distant .",
    "all this reaffirms that little error is genrated by the folding process alone , even in the presence of interaction .",
    "one advantage of mf is that real- and imaginary - time versions can be used in conjunction to simulate quench dynamics where the initial state is set to the ground state of a hamiltonian with dominant interaction .",
    "this is especially useful when the evolution is governed by a single - particle hamiltonian .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] exemplify this approach using the ground states featured in figure [ fig5 ] as initial states .",
    "after interaction and confining potential have been switched off , atoms evolve freely toward a fluctuation - dominated phase . in the time span",
    "considered , the atom cloud does not expand significantly beyond its initial domain , instead , there is an increase in hopping across the whole extent of the cloud . as longer times",
    "are addressed , the simulation cost soars .",
    "the techniques introduced in this work make use of the basic idea of folding of modes to develop numerical routines that calculate the quantum state .",
    "although each application is different , the essence of every method is the same .",
    "certainly , the folding idea is potentially versatile and may give rise to additional simulation protocols . to give an example of another application ,",
    "let us conceive the dynamical modes as a superposition of the hamiltonian eigenvectors as follows @xmath84 so that @xmath85 initially , making @xmath86 , the superposition lacks the exponential terms .",
    "therefrom , the first move is to fold @xmath87 using unitary transformations until only @xmath88 remains . without further action",
    ", @xmath88 is automatically expelled from the updated versions of all the other @xmath89 s .",
    "next , the single - particle operation @xmath90 is applied .",
    "the inverses of the transformations employed to fold @xmath87 are then executed in reverse order .",
    "this brings @xmath87 back into the superposition , but accompanied by the term @xmath91 , leaving the other @xmath89 s as they were at the beginning .",
    "an analogous sequence is then applied , focusing this time on @xmath92 , in order to incorporate @xmath93 .",
    "the rest of the protocol ensues in a logical manner until all the exponentials are introduced .",
    "the transformations are then collected and put together to assemble an evolution operator that can be implemented in terms of tensor states .",
    "a very similar scheme can be formulated to handle non - unitary transformations .",
    "the problem is that the corresponding numerics is not very stable owing to the recurrent folding - unfolding sequence , but the proposal is perfectly valid .",
    "additional folding schemes will be reported in future contributions .",
    "numerical techniques with applications to interacting systems have been introduced and probed .",
    "the proposals are developed in the context of local interactions and are based on the idea of mode folding and on the efficient use of tensor states .",
    "real as well as imaginary time implementations of the evolution operator are discussed , elaborating on the handling of each particular case .",
    "the method compares well with tse in terms of accuracy and simulation time .",
    "however , its potential mainly resides , on the one hand , in the possibility of managing hopping of arbitrary scope , and on the other hand , in the perspective that it offers about the role of single - body- and many - body structures in the calculation of a quantum state . as an extension",
    ", it would be interesting to consider the prospects of folding of fermionic modes .",
    "as it is known , the sign - problem prevents the effective use of tse .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the alternative path taken by mf somehow allows to circumvent the adverse effects of fermion algebra .",
