    "dust in damped ly @xmath0 ( dla ) systems has important implications for studies of the chemical evolution of the universe @xcite .",
    "dust absorption is correlated with metallicity so the more metal rich systems will be underrepresented in dla surveys using magnitude limited samples of background targets . evidence for dust in dla systems comes from the statistics of the spectral slopes of the background quasars .",
    "quasars with dla systems have , on average , redder spectra @xcite .",
    "the background control quasars have a range of spectral slopes , so the confirmation of reddening in any individual dla system is usually not possible by this method .",
    "evidence for dust in dla systems also comes from studies of the column density ratios of certain ions , in particular cr ii / zn ii @xcite .",
    "cr is more readily depleted by grain formation than zn which normally undergoes very little dust depletion .",
    "@xcite find low metallicities based on zn , with [ @xmath12zn / h@xmath13 is the base 10 logarithm of the abundance ratio of a / h divided by the solar a / h ratio .",
    "] = @xmath141.03 for @xmath11 @xmath15 1.5 , a large scatter , and little or no evolution of metallicity with redshift .",
    "the dust content in these low metallicity systems is low mainly because the systems are low metallicity but also because the available metals are not efficiently converted to dust .",
    "based on cr ii / zn ii and other line ratios , the dust  to  metals ratio is estimated to be @xmath16 0.5 times that of the local galactic ism @xcite . the combination of low metallicity and the 0.5 fractional dust  to  metals ratio relative to galactic leads to the result that dust should mainly show up in dla systems in the selective depletion of certain elements , like cr , while the typical extinction due to dust is small , @xmath17 @xmath16 0.1 @xcite .",
    "however , there is still some uncertainty in the interpretation of the observed element abundances in dla systems because the overall pattern may not match the combined effect of early @xmath0 process ( sne ii ) enhancement combined with dust depletion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". there may be a problem with the use of zn as a metallicity indicator because super  solar values of [ zn / fe ] might result from early zn production by sne ii nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "if zn is not a good metallicity indicator , then [ cr / zn ] is an unreliable indicator of dust when cr is apparently depleted by only a small amount relative to zn .",
    "a more direct detection of dust in individual dla systems is possible by the observation of the 2175    dust feature thought to be produced by graphitic dust grains ( draine 1993 ; will and aannestad 1999 ) .",
    "somewhat less direct evidence for dust is the presence of diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) which are known to correlate with @xmath18 and other dust indicators in our galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "dibs have been observed in only a few extragalactic objects : the lmc ( vladilo et al . 1987 ) and ngc 5128 ( cen a ) ( dodorico et al . 1989 ) and toward some dusty starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "a search for the 2175    feature in a sample of quasars with dla systems by @xcite yielded no detections .",
    "pei et al . suggest that galactic type dust is ruled out in these systems and that the dust absorption may have an extinction curve similar to that associated with either the small magellanic cloud or the large magellanic cloud .",
    "the smc extinction has essentially no 2175    feature while the lmc extinction has a weaker 2175    extinction feature relative to galactic extinction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a broad 2175    feature has been detected by @xcite in a composite spectrum created by aligning 96 quasar mg ii absorption systems .",
    "the nature of the composite spectrum and the relatively shallow feature found by @xcite make any dust  to  gas ratio and extinction curve determination very uncertain .",
    "a galactic type 2175    feature has recently been discovered in a quasar absorption system at @xmath19 by @xcite .",
    "this system was found in the analysis of the spectra of the gravitationally lensed quasar sbs 0909@xmath20532 .",
    "the 2175    feature is apparent in the ratio of the spectra from the two lines  of  sight .",
    "such lines  of  sight are very valuable for determining extinction curves because the extinction can be determined independently of the underlying spectral shape .",
    "because the absorption is probably due to the lensing galaxy @xcite , the selection properties of these systems differ from the absorption survey selected high column density and dla absorbers .",

    "this paper concludes with a brief summary ,  5 .",
    "ao 0235 + 164 was observed with hst / stis on 11 february 1998 ( ut ) in the spectroscopic mode .",
    "the observations consisted of stis nuv - mama g230l ( 15703180   ) , stis ccd g430l ( 29005700   ) , and stis ccd g750l ( 523610266   ) spectra , with total integration times of 12,833 s ( 5 orbits ) , 2874 s ( 1 orbit ) , and 2160 s ( 1 orbit ) respectively .",
    "all of the data were obtained using the 0.5 arcsec wide slit .",
    "the data were reduced using stsci stsdas software .",
    "the g750l observation was flat fielded using a contemporaneous flat field exposure to correct fringing . a comparison of the spectrum before and after the fringing correction shows that the corrected spectrum is free from apparent structure due to residual fringing . before performing a @xmath25 analysis on these three spectra ,",
    "the flux - corrected stis g230l spectrum was adjusted by multiplication by 0.98 to match the g430l spectrum where the spectra overlap .",
    "observations of ao 0235 + 164 from the keck observatory were obtained as part of a program to study the galaxies near ao 0235 + 164 ( p.i .",
    "e. m. burbidge ) .",
    "the observations were obtained on 1997 november 7 ( ut ) with the keck ii 10 m telescope and the lris low resolution spectrograph . a 300 g / mm 5000    blaze grating provided a wavelength coverage of 4000    to 9000    ( with order overlap ) and a resolution ( with a 1.0 arcsec wide slit ) of about 10    fwhm and 2.5    per pixel sampling .",
    "the spectrum of ao 0235 + 164 discussed in this paper is from an 1800 s integration at a slit pa = 0 degrees that was chosen to include ao , a faint galaxy due north of ao , and object a. the integration begun at ha = 1:05 east and the beginning airmass was 1.02 .",
    "the data were reduced using vista .",
    "figure 1 shows the hst stis and keck lris spectra .",
    "the 1.0 arcsec wide slit keck lris observation of ao 0235 + 164 was scaled by 1.58 , the ratio of fluxes between an 8.7 arcsec wide and 1.0 arcsec wide slit observation of feige 110 , the standard star observed at the beginning of night . because slit losses can vary depending on guiding and seeing",
    ", the absolute flux of the 7 november 1997 keck spectrum of ao 0235 + 164 has a large uncertainty , of order @xmath3 20% .",
    "the keck observations during the short , half night , program were intended to measure emission lines in faint nearby galaxies , especially [ o ii ] @xmath263727 at @xmath22 = 0.524 , and were not particularly well suited for high signal  to  noise spectra of ao itself .",
    "the keck spectrum of ao 0235 + 164 shows structure in the 7000 to 9000    range due to less than perfect fringe correction and residuals from atmospheric absorption bands at about 6900     and 7600   .",
    "a comparison of the stis and keck spectra scaled to match each other around 6000    shows that the keck spectrum is somewhat steeper than the hst stis spectrum below 7000   .",
    "the difference is marginally significant since it amounts to @xmath3 5% , which is about the maximum uncertainty that is expected in the relative flux calibration for the keck lris spectrum . at wavelengths longer than 7000    the keck spectrum is not reliably flux calibrated due to order overlap .",
    "the highly variable ao 0235 + 164 was about a factor of 2 brighter on 11 february 1998 during the stis observations than on 7 november 1997 , some 4 months earlier .",
    "asca observation of ao 0235 + 164 started on february 11 , 1998 at 7:58 ut .",
    "the observation lasted for about 16 hours , and yielded about 15 ks of useful data .",
    "the data were reduced in a standard manner , where the screening criteria were the same as those used in the reduction of the 1994 asca data for this object by @xcite . in our analysis",
    ", we used the data reduction tools provided by heasarc ; the most recent tools available as of january 1 , 2003 .",
    "this includes the standard response matrices for gis detectors , and matrices derived from standard calibration files via the sisrmg tool for the sis detectors .",
    "the effective area files were calculated using the ascaarf tool v. 3.10 using the standard asca calibration files .",
    "all reduction of the sis data was performed in the bright2 mode . for further analysis",
    ", the data were binned such that there were at least 20 counts in each new energy bin , and the energy range for spectral fits was restricted to the bandpass of 0.5 - 10 kev for all four instruments .",
    "for all four detectors , the background was extracted from the same image as the source , avoiding any obvious point sources .",
    "the background - subtracted source count rates were respectively @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 counts s@xmath31 in sis0 , sis1 , gis2 , and gis3 detectors .",
    "we saw no measurable variability of the count rate within the span of our observation .",
    "note that those count rates were roughly 2.5 times greater than the count rates during the 1994 asca observation .",
    "the spectral fitting of the data was entirely analogous to that reported in @xcite : data from all four detectors were fitted to a single common model , including a power law continuum , modified by photoelectric absorption . in agreement with the previous spectra ,",
    "the inferred column was in excess of the galactic value .",
    "we fixed the galactic column to @xmath32 @xmath6 @xcite , and assumed that the excess would be due to the intervening system at @xmath33 .",
    "for the purpose of comparison with the previous asca data sets , we assumed ( incorrectly , as we argue below ) that the entire excess absorption ( beyond the galactic value ) is at @xmath33 and obeys solar abundances . with this , the equivalent hydrogen column density at @xmath33 was fitted to be @xmath34 @xmath6 , which , within errors , was consistent with the values measured via previous asca and rosat observations . the energy power ",
    "law index @xmath0 was @xmath35 and the @xmath36 for the 1998 asca data was 260 for 263 pha bins .",
    "this indicates that the spectrum was harder in 1998 than in 1994 when @xmath0 was @xmath37 , but this was not surprising , as the indices already differed between the previous asca and rosat observations , conducted @xmath38 months apart . as mentioned above , the source was brighter than in the 1994 asca observation : the 2 - 10 kev model flux for the feb .",
    "1998 data was @xmath39 erg @xmath6 s@xmath31 , vs. @xmath40 erg @xmath6 s@xmath31 in feb .",
    "figure 2 shows the 1998 asca x - ray spectrum of ao 0235 - 164 .    since the absorption values inferred from the rosat and the two asca data sets were consistent with a single value , in our subsequent analysis we fitted all three data sets simultaneously , assuming constant effect of the combined absorption .",
    "we assumed that the intrinsic spectrum of the bl lac object is a simple power law , but we allowed the normalization and the power law index to vary from one data set to another to account for the observed continuum variability .",
    "we used the rosat and 1994 asca data reduced in a manner given in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we performed the analysis using the current calibration files for asca and rosat , but there was no discernible difference between the two analyses .",
    "as above , we fixed the galactic absorption at @xmath32 @xmath6 .",
    "regarding the modeling of the intervening absorption , we followed the approach of @xcite , where we assumed that the absorption at @xmath33 consists of two components , both parameterized via equivalent hydrogen column density .",
    "one component , having the primordial composition of elements , consists of pure hydrogen plus 76 % of the solar abundance value of helium ( by number of atoms ) .",
    "the other component represents all processed elements with their relative ratios to each other at the solar value , but it contains no hydrogen , and only 24 % of the solar abundance value of helium . such an approach is necessary , since the helium in the primordial absorber has an effect on the absorption even in the asca band .",
    "it also allows us to immediately estimate the metallicity of the intervening absorber since the ratio of the processed column to the column inferred from the damped ly @xmath0 analysis yields the metallicity of the intervening system in solar units .",
    "given the modest energy resolution of the asca or rosat detectors , no discrete spectral features were detected in any data sets .",
    "with this , the relative contributions of either absorption component are highly correlated , and this is clearly illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "while the best - fit values of the primordial and processed columns would be respectively @xmath41 @xmath6 and @xmath42 @xmath6 , yielding @xmath36 of 528.5 for 535 pha bins , fixing the primordial column at @xmath43 @xmath6 ( based on the dla fit  see  3.1 ) increases @xmath36 only to 530.0 , and implies that the column density of the processed material is @xmath44 @xmath6 . with this , we immediately find the metallicity of the intervening system , @xmath8 , to be @xmath45 solar ( the quoted uncertainty includes the range of x - ray measurements and the uncertainty of the h i column based on the stis spectrum , added in quadrature ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the stis nuv mama g230l spectrum of ao 0235 + 164 in the region around the dla line at @xmath1 = 0.524 and a @xmath25 fit to g230l spectrum from 1690   to 2240  .",
    "this fit gives @xmath2 = 5 @xmath3 1 @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "the one @xmath46 uncertainty includes both the formal error and an estimate of some of the systematic uncertainties .",
    "the one @xmath46 formal error in @xmath2 from the @xmath25 fit and the associated curvature matrix is ( @xmath47 ) @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "the continuum level , continuum slope , and @xmath18 at @xmath11 = 0.0 were left as free parameters in this @xmath25 fit so the uncertainties in these values entered the @xmath2 formal uncertainty in the proper way from the cross terms in the curvature matrix .",
    "possible systematic errors result from the unknown shape of the local continuum .",
    "the continuum may deviate from a power law , and there are uncertainties in the shape of the @xmath1 = 0 and @xmath1 = 0.524 dust absorption extinction curves .",
    "weak metal lines in the @xmath1 = 0.524 and @xmath1 = 0.852 absorption systems occur in the wings of the dla profile along with possible ly@xmath0 forest contamination with some uncertainty in the relative line strengths .",
    "these systematic errors were investigated by repeating the fitting process assuming different shapes for the continuum and different line strengths for the weak lines .",
    "the relative strengths of all the weak lines are not completely arbitrary .",
    "each line , modeled as a voigt profile with a single component , has a strength determined by the column density of the ion producing the line .",
    "solar abundances were sometimes used as a guide to determine ranges for column density ratios between selected ions .",
    "for example , the si ii column density is constrained to be less than the c ii column density in the model for the absorption lines produced by the @xmath1 = 0.524 dla system .",
    "some lines , such as those from si ii , are constrained by multiple lines from si ii within this spectral range .",
    "other absorption lines , including the lines that are ly @xmath0 forest lines , are only constrained by the data . repeating the @xmath25 fit after excluding from the model spectrum all the weak lines that are not well detected , and treating all of the observed structure on the wings of the dla line as noise , results in a higher @xmath2 estimate ; @xmath2 = 7 @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath6 . but this model spectrum does not fit the core of the observed dla line as well as the @xmath2 = 5 @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath6 model .",

    "ao 0235 + 164 , the background radio source is very compact .",
    "thus the @xmath7 estimate for the ao 0235@xmath20164 @xmath1 = 0.524 dla system may be somewhat more robust than the @xmath7 estimates in some other dla systems .",
    "however there is an added uncertainty for ao 0235@xmath20164 because the @xmath1 = 0.524 h i 21 cm absorption is time variable @xcite .",
    "an inspection of the 14 epochs of h i 21 cm absorption displayed by @xcite , obtained over a four year period from 1977 to 1981 , shows that , although there are large ( up to a factor of two ) changes in individual components , the added uncertainty to @xmath7 due to variability is not large , @xmath53 20% peak to peak , if the 21 cm absorption stays within the range observed by @xcite .",
    "other systematic errors in @xmath7 are more difficult to estimate and the @xmath360 k uncertainty given above reflects only the error in @xmath2 combined in quadrature with @xmath320% as a rough estimate for the effects of variability .",
    "as discussed above in $ 2.3 , the total metallicity in the @xmath1 = 0.524 dla system can be estimated from the observed @xmath2 and x - ray absorption .",
    "the main elements contributing to the x - ray absorption in the rosat / asca bands at the column inferred here are oxygen , and to a lesser extent , carbon and iron .",
    "the x - ray absorption measurement is particularly valuable , as the inferred column includes a contribution of all phases of the the absorber , not just the gas phase .",
    "the observed @xmath2 = 5 @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath6 from the dla fixes the hydrogen column in the `` primordial '' component . with a fixed `` primordial '' component ,",
    "the spectral fit to the x - ray data above gives a metallicity @xmath8 = 0.72 @xmath3 0.24 @xmath9 , where again , the range of allowed x - ray absorption and the uncertainty in @xmath2 are added in quadrature .",
    "there is some added uncertainty due to the time variable nature of the absorber given our use of x - ray data which are at least in part , non - simultaneous with the stis data . adding in a 20% additional uncertainty due to variability ( a rough estimate based on the maximum range of 21-cm variability observed by @xcite  see above ) increases the uncertainty to @xmath3 0.28 .",
    "so our final metallicity is @xmath8 = 0.72 @xmath3 0.28 @xmath9 .",
    "it is interesting to juxtapose the comparison of the h i absorption data and the x - ray column for ao 0235 + 164 against those measured in another dla system at slightly lower redshift , @xmath54 , located in front of pks 1127 - 145 ( which is at @xmath55 ) .",
    "this system shows an h i column of @xmath56 10@xmath5 @xmath6 , quite similar to the column in ao 0235 + 164 .",
    "chandra observations of this object revealed excess x - ray absorption above the expected galactic value @xcite .",
    "however , this excess is significantly smaller than in ao 0235 + 164 , indicating that the metallicity is less than 0.17 @xmath9 , much lower than in ao 0235 + 164 .",
    "this implies that the metallicity of the ism varies significantly from one galaxy to another .",
