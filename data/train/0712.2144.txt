    "the present paper is a continuation of our previous work on shell sources of the levi - civita spacetime ( lc ) @xcite .",
    "the thin - shell formalism @xcite provides insight into the physical meaning of the parameters appearing in the metric and can set limits on their admissible ranges .",
    "our aim is to extend the studied spacetimes to include a non - zero cosmological constant @xmath0 . in the present - day cosmology , the role of spacetimes with @xmath1 has grown significantly since models with a positive effective cosmological constant describe the inflationary phase and , moreover , recent observations still seem to indicate that our universe indeed has @xmath1 . on the other hand , the anti de sitter spacetime ( ads )",
    "has come to the fore from a more theoretical perspective in light of the conjecture relating string theory in asymptotically ads space to a non - gravitational conformal theory on the boundary at spatial infinity .",
    "however , the motivation for considering material systems with cylindrical symmetry in asymptotically ads spacetimes comes also from the ` classical general relativity ' .",
    "it is well known that with @xmath2 , the asymptotics of cylindrically symmetric static spacetimes representing _ infinite _ sources is very different from that of spatially _ bounded _ static sources . as we shall indicate below , with @xmath3 , the asymptotic forms of the metrics due to material cylinders and bounded sources are closely related .",
    "it is therefore of interest to study the effects of both positive and negative cosmological constants on the matter sources of cylindrical spacetimes . at present , we restrict ourselves to static spacetimes since the involved effects are still rich enough while the number of free parameters is lower and thus it is easier to interpret our results . in general , we admit spacetimes outside and inside the shell to have different values of @xmath0if the cosmological constant is considered to be vacuum energy , such assumption is not unnatural ( and , indeed , has been made in literature in case of spherical shells giving rise to the so - called domain walls @xcite ) .",
    "we can also introduce flat or ads spacetime inside the cylinder .",
    "although in this work we only consider static metrics and their sources , we also realize their possible applications as background spacetimes in the study of gravitational waves produced by material sources  specific simple perturbations of cylindrical spacetimes allow a rather explicit treatment @xcite .",
    "the line element of a static , cylindrically symmetric spacetime with a non - zero cosmological constant ( lc@xmath0 ) was independently derived in @xcite and @xcite . in cylindrical coordinates @xmath4 ( the standard range of @xmath5 is ensured by the presence of the conicity parameter @xmath6 ) the metric reads @xmath7 where @xmath8 @xmath9 is related to the linear mass density of the source , and for @xmath1 we have @xmath10 while for @xmath3 we substitute trigonometric functions by their hyperbolic counterparts and @xmath0 by @xmath11see [ derivation of the metric ] .",
    "the trigonometric functions in ( [ metric , positive lambda ] ) are multiplied by such constants that in the limit @xmath12 or @xmath13 the metric smoothly approaches the lc case ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "thus , the dimensions of @xmath14 and @xmath15 are general powers of length as is the case in the standard form of the lc metric @xcite . by redefining @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "we can convert coordinates to the usual dimensions of length .",
    "[ discussion of asymptotics]the advantage of the studied spacetimes over the lc case is that for @xmath3 , far away from the symmetry axis , @xmath18 , they approach the anti de sitter solution ( ads ) unlike lc that does not approach the minkowski spacetime .",
    "we show explicitly that if we transform a schwarzschild - anti de sitter black hole ( sads ) from schwarzschild to horospherical coordinates then far away from @xmath18 , the leading - order diagonal terms are identical to the lc@xmath0 expansion ( and to ads ) and the second - order terms have the same dependance on the radial coordinate , @xmath19 , which is to the first order the proper distance from the axis .",
    "this indicates that the properties of cylindrical shells with @xmath3 might be of importance in the study of finite massive objects in contrast to the asymptotically minkowskian spacetimes and the lc solution .    moreover , lemos @xcite found an interesting class of cylindrically symmetric 4d solutions with @xmath3 called black strings .",
    "( see section 5 in @xcite ) . ]",
    "these spacetimes describe the fields of charged , rotating strings that generally feature singularities and horizons and are asymptotically anti de sitter far away from the axis of symmetry .",
    "we clarify here the relation of static , uncharged black strings to the general lc@xmath0 solutions and find non - singular sources of such spacetimes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we discuss various properties of lc@xmath0 spacetimes , in particular , their relation to the black - string metrics and their asymptotic form , we introduce suitable quantities characterizing their spatial geometry and conicity ( we also correct some minor misprints in the literature ) .",
    "the shell sources of lc@xmath0 are constructed in section 3 where we analyze the physical properties of matter forming the shells and find the resulting restrictions on the lc@xmath0 parameters .",
    "we relegate a number of issues into 3 appendices . in [ derivation of the metric ] , we derive the lc@xmath0 metric following @xcite and point out several interesting details such as its precise relation to the ads spacetime .",
    "[ asymptotics ] gives the resulting form of the asymptotic expansion of ( [ lc+lambda ] ) for @xmath3 and compares it to the sads spacetime .",
    "finally , in [ bound on m1 ] , we discuss the admissible range of the mass per unit length for shell sources of the lc@xmath0 spacetimes .",
    "it is important to realize that the lc@xmath0 solutions ( [ lc+lambda ] ) are not conformally flat unless we put @xmath2and thus also not conformal to ( anti ) de sitter spacetime  since the weyl tensor is non - zero . in general , the solutions are of petrov type i except for some special values of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the killing vectors @xmath20 , and @xmath21 the metrics admit additional killing vectors in special cases : @xmath22 in the vicinity of the axis , @xmath23 , ( [ lc+lambda ] ) behaves as the lc solution . after replacing @xmath24",
    ", we find the roles of @xmath25 and @xmath5 interchanged .",
    "this indicates that the case @xmath26 corresponds to planar rather than cylindrical symmetry ( confer the first killing vector in ( [ killing vectors ] ) ) .",
    "the solution with @xmath1 is periodic in @xmath19 with a period @xmath27 ; it contains curvature singularities at @xmath28 integer except for special cases of @xmath9 @xcite ; there is no limit @xmath29 and the metric is _ not _ asymptotically de sitter .    for @xmath3",
    ", there are no singularities apart from the axis . after a simple rescaling of @xmath30 we find that asymptotically at @xmath29 , the metric ( [ lc+lambda ] ) has the form @xmath31 which is a part of ads in horospherical coordinates ( see [ derivation of the metric ] ) .",
    "this makes the asymptotics of cylindrical solutions with @xmath3 more realistic than the case @xmath2 .",
    "[ discussion of asymptotics part ii]if we approach infinity in any direction not parallel to the axis then the leading terms of the asymptotics of the metric coincide with those of spatially isolated sources . for @xmath32",
    "this is not the case since the asymptotics of the lc solution is _ not _ minkowskian and we have no natural ( asymptotically flat ) infinity that would enable us to define static observers . to illustrate this",
    ", we compare the asymptotics of ( [ lc+lambda ] ) and that of schwarzschild - ads spacetime in horospherical coordinates in [ asymptotics ] .",
    "it is of interest that lc@xmath0 with @xmath3 includes the static , uncharged black - string metric of @xcite .",
    "if we set @xmath33 in ( [ lc+lambda ] ) and introduce new coordinates @xmath34 we obtain : @xmath35 with @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "this is the form of the black - string metric of equation ( 2.3 ) in @xcite .",
    "@xmath39 corresponds to the mass per unit length of the black string calculated at radial infinity using the hamiltonian formalism of brown and york @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is instructive to compare @xmath39 to the mass per unit length of the shell sources we find in section [ induced energy - momentum tensor ] .    to illustrate some other properties of lc@xmath0 , we summarize the circumferences @xmath40 of the rings @xmath41constant at special radii @xmath19 in .",
    "@xmath42    for example , with @xmath1 and @xmath43 \\cup [ 1/4,1/2 \\ , ] $ ] the circumference remains finite everywhere , including @xmath18 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath18 represents the axis ( zero circumference ) for @xmath44 and any value of @xmath0 .",
    "if we also require that @xmath45 has an infinite circumference for @xmath1 then the range of @xmath9 is more limited : @xmath46 . for @xmath3 ,",
    "the circumference is always infinite at @xmath29 and we find @xmath44 again .    in order to characterize the conicity of cylindrically symmetric spacetimes in a geometrical way , we define the following two quantities @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the proper radius ( in our case identical to @xmath19 ) and the circumference @xmath40 is introduced above . in case of cosmic strings with @xmath49 , both @xmath50 and @xmath51 coincide everywhere with the conicity parameter @xmath6 .",
    "close to the axis , these quantities behave as follows @xmath52 where @xmath53 is defined in ( [ definition of a using sigma ] ) .",
    "they do not contain @xmath0 and are identical to the levi - civita case .",
    "in general , @xmath51 can even be negative , nevertheless , for @xmath54 and for @xmath55 , @xmath51 is positive everywhere . for @xmath1 , we find that as we approach the singularity at @xmath45 the value of @xmath51 is proportional to @xmath56 and thus it vanishes unless @xmath57 . for @xmath3 ,",
    "we find at radial infinity that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are both positive and decrease as a power of @xmath0 times @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .    considering the above properties , we conclude that the intuitive ranges of @xmath9 are as follows : with @xmath54 and with @xmath60 . if we also include the behavior of geodesics we can further restrict the latter to @xmath61 .",
    "to construct shell sources of lc@xmath0 , we imagine two cylindrical regions of the spacetimes with metrics ( [ lc+lambda ] ) and independent parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 . we shall also consider minkowski and ads solutions as the interior spacetimes . as required by the israel formalism @xcite , we glue the boundaries @xmath64 and",
    "@xmath65 together in such a way that the induced 3-metric on the surfaces with intrinsic coordinates @xmath66 is identical from both sides ; the induced metric can always be made flat by rescaling the intrinsic coordinates as the metric only depends on the radial coordinate @xmath19 .",
    "we also require the proper circumference of the two cylinders to be the same .",
    "this identification induces a 3-dimensional energy - momentum tensor on the junction hypersurface .",
    "the induced tensor is diagonal and its components read .",

    "note that the ( global ) conicity parameters @xmath69 of the metric do not appear in these ( local ) expressions . if we take the limit @xmath70 and use the transformation formulae given in @xcite we recover precisely the induced energy - momentum tensor of the levi - civita metric @xcite , equation 3 .",
    "let us turn to the interpretation of the induced energy - momentum tensor .",
    "one of the simplest models is a shell of counter - rotating photons . then the trace @xmath71 which implies @xmath72 note that this condition does not involve @xmath73 . if , in addition , we require @xmath74 we obtain the solutions @xmath75 with an arbitrary integer @xmath76 .",
    "these solutions are due to the periodicity of the metric and are difficult to interpret : we either have singularities outside the shell or , alternatively , we have to construct an infinite series of coaxial cylinders to cut out all the singularities .",
    "however , for a _ negative _ cosmological constant , we only have a single solution , namely @xmath77 , which can be non - singular both in- and outside of the shell .",
    "admitting still both signs of @xmath0 , we now wish to find the form of the induced energy - momentum tensor that can be interpreted as a shell of photons counter - rotating in the @xmath78-direction with @xmath79 constant ( ` azimuthal ' photons ) or , possibly , moving along the @xmath79-direction with @xmath78 constant ( ` axial ' photons ) . since we wish to avoid the singularity along the axis we must set @xmath80 or @xmath81 . substituting into ( [ induced tensor with lambda ] ) , denoting the mass per unit length of the shell measured by static ( geodetical ) observers @xmath82 ( with @xmath40 the circumference of the shell and @xmath83 its surface energy density ) , and with @xmath84 , we summarize the results in the following :    [ trivial photons ] @xmath85    for @xmath1 , although some cylindrical shells are ` physical ' ( @xmath86 ) , the exterior metric always contains singularities . in the case @xmath87",
    ", we need to extend the solution through a coordinate singularity . however , this is not the case with @xmath3 , which is also described in if we formally only consider @xmath76 even and put @xmath88 . clearly , the only physically acceptable solutions are those with @xmath89 , so that @xmath80 , @xmath90 , which corresponds to cylinders of azimuthal photons . in the limit",
    "@xmath70 these results go over to the lc case of @xcite , section 3 .    as in the simpler @xmath2 case , there are no cylinders of purely axial photons .",
    "one expects this for @xmath3 due to its attractive character .",
    "however , with @xmath1 , one might have hoped that the repulsive effects of the cosmological constant might permit such a solution ; this was our original motivation .",
    "nevertheless , the singularities located at @xmath91 do not allow this .",
    "since we wish to discuss primarily smooth and physical metrics ( [ lc+lambda ] ) we shall be mainly concerned with lc@xmath0 spacetimes with @xmath3 . only in these cases",
    "we do not encounter singularities at @xmath91 .",
    "we first assume @xmath92 and put @xmath93 so that there is no singularity on the axis ; we shall consider also minkowski and ads regions inside the shells ",
    "then the axis is regular automatically .",
    "let us first notice that condition ( [ photons with lambda ] ) is also relevant to the massive - particle interpretation .",
    "in this case we require @xmath94 with @xmath3 we obtain a simple condition @xmath95 .",
    "( this condition becomes more involved for @xmath1 . )",
    "we begin by considering counter - rotating azimuthal streams of massive particles .",

    "also , observe that in general @xmath109 for @xmath110 and that the curves @xmath111 are monotonically increasing for all values @xmath3 and @xmath112 .",
    "[ discussion of limits on m1 ] given the results for the levi - civita spacetimes with @xmath2 , we expect that there is an upper bound on @xmath102 .",
    "this , indeed , can be seen from figure 1 : the mass per unit length @xmath102 reaches its maximum value of 1/4 just for the lc case @xmath2 .",
    "as @xmath113 increases the maximum of @xmath102 ( located always at @xmath90 ) decreases .",
    "this behavior can be proved analytically from ( [ mass_per_unit_length ] ) .",
    "it is physically intuitive in view of increased gravity due to the presence of the negative cosmological constant .",
    "a more detailed analysis reveals that the upper bound on @xmath114 holds also in more general cases with different @xmath0 s if @xmath115 as shown in [ bound on m1 ] .",
    "next we focus on _ perfect - fluid _ interpretation of the induced energy - momentum tensor .",
    "if we require @xmath80 , @xmath92 , and @xmath116 and substitute this into ( [ induced tensor with lambda ] ) we obtain a simple relation @xmath117 this enables us to express the density @xmath118 and pressure @xmath119 of the fluid as functions of @xmath100 ( or of circumference @xmath40 ) , @xmath0 , and @xmath104 . for a given @xmath40 and @xmath0",
    "this amounts to an implicit equation of state given by relations @xmath120 . for the graphs of @xmath102 and @xmath121 , see",
    "; here we only point out that @xmath102 can exceed 1/4 unless we impose further conditions , such as the dominant energy condition @xmath122 for any circumference of the cylinder .",
    "the admissible range of the lc parameter reads @xmath123 ( or @xmath124 $ ] with the dominant energy condition ) .",
    "we now turn to the case with flat spacetime inside the cylinder .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath125 , @xmath80 , @xmath126 , and thus may be considered a ` domain wall ' in 3 + 1 dimensions . for perfect",
    "fluid , the relation @xmath127 ( cf .",
    "( [ induced energy - momentum tensor ] ) ) implies @xmath128 substituting this expression back into ( [ induced tensor with lambda ] ) , we obtain a relation between density and pressure : @xmath129 which does not depend on @xmath130 and is thus identical to the levi - civita case .",
    "the expressions for @xmath131 and the pressure @xmath121 read @xmath132 the numerator of the last expression is always positive ( @xmath126 ) and thus if we require positive and finite pressure we must have @xmath133 .",
    "we have @xmath134the last expression corresponds to the lc case , see @xcite . for @xmath102 to be positive we must have @xmath135 or @xmath136 . in combination with the restrictions on the pressure we conclude @xmath123 .",
    "in this interval of @xmath104 , we get @xmath137 just like in the levi - civita case ( however , @xmath102 becomes negative for sufficiently large @xmath138 ) .",
    "let us yet mention solutions with minkowski inside and azimuthal particles .",
    "in this case we obtain @xmath139 the numerator of ( [ m - lcl vfi ] ) is always positive and thus @xmath140 .",
    "since @xmath141 we must further have @xmath142 $ ] . then @xmath143 .",
    "the bounds on @xmath104 and @xmath102 are just the same as in the levi - civita case .",
    "we now consider the anti de sitter spacetime in horospherical coordinates ( [ ads in horospherical coordinates ] ) inside the cylinder with @xmath144 .",
    "first fact to mention here is that the circumference at @xmath18 is @xmath145 and to reach the axis ( zero circumference ) , we need to go farther , to @xmath146 .",
    "therefore , the radial proper distance ( measured directly by @xmath19 ) from the axis to the surface of the cylinder is always infinite .",
    "we thus include within the cylindrical shell a vast part of the ads space and we can expect the influence of @xmath0 to be strong .",
    "indeed , unlike in lc@xmath0 , there are for example no circular geodesics at constant _ horospherical _ coordinates @xmath147 in ads .",
    "in addition , we find that we can not interpret the shell energy - momentum tensor in terms of either massive particles or photons .",
    "perfect fluid requires @xmath90 necessarily .",
    "equation ( [ induced tensor with lambda ] ) implies @xmath148 inverting the last expression in the form of a series @xmath149 we notice that for small pressure , @xmath150 , which corresponds to ` 2d null fluid ' .",
    "notice that @xmath151 is not bounded for large @xmath100 .",
    "this is not very surprising as the anti de sitter metric inside of the shell is the asymptotical form of the metric ( [ lc+lambda ] ) and thus this shell is equivalent to a shell with the same form of metric on both sides of the cut and with @xmath152 .",
    "this , however , is in sharp contradiction to the assumption @xmath153 which is a necessary condition for @xmath137 ( see [ bound on m1 ] ) .",
    "another interesting case is the black - string metric of @xcite .",
    "this is a typical example where we can explore the physical meaning of the parameters by finding non - singular sources of the spacetime .",
    "let us thus use the ads spacetime inside our cylindrical shell and the black - string spacetime ( [ black - string metric ] ) with the same cosmological constant outside .",
    "this yields an induced energy - momentum tensor that corresponds to perfect fluid .",
    "the shell must necessarily be located above the horizon ( @xmath154{4m}/\\sqrt{-\\lambda/3}$ ] , see [ black - string metric ] ) .",
    "the proper mass per unit length of these cylinders , @xmath155 , reads @xmath156 with @xmath157 .",
    "if we let @xmath158 , @xmath102 vanishes while it reaches its limiting value @xmath159 for cylinders just above the horizon and we are not able to construct more massive cylinders . as shown in @xcite , @xmath39 is the mass of a cylindrical strip of spacetime defined by unit coordinate length along the @xmath25-axis which is coordinate dependent and the corresponding proper length vanishes on the axis and diverges at radial infinity .",
    "if we define @xmath160 as the mass of a section of a unit _ proper _ length , we obtain a different maximum value @xmath161 . in both cases , however , it turns out that @xmath102 is proportional neither to @xmath39 , nor to @xmath160 , confirming that it measures a different physical property of the solution .",
    "we considered static , vacuum , cylindrically symmetric spacetimes with a non - zero cosmological constant , their geometrical properties , and their sources formed by cylindrical shells of counter - rotating photons or dust and of perfect fluid .",
    "we have shown that even with @xmath162 , the lc parameter must be confined to the interval @xmath108 $ ] , i.e. , the same range as for @xmath2 . to the first order",
    ", it determines the mass @xmath102 per unit length of the source .",
    "the range of @xmath102 is no longer bounded by 1/4 .",
    "this fact thus represents the main difference from the levi - civita case .",
