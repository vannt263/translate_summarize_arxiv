    "red galaxies contain the majority of the stellar mass at low redshift ( hogg et  al .",
    "2002 ) , so understanding their formation and assembly is one of the key goals of both observational and theoretical extragalactic astronomy .",
    "the stellar populations of these galaxies are dominated by an old component , with little ongoing star formation ( e.g. , tinsley 1968 ) .",
    "observationally , it is unclear if this star formation occurred in situ at @xmath15 , or if these stars formed in lower mass galaxies which were later assembled via galaxy mergers . simulations of red galaxy evolution predict varying assembly and star formation histories , with some papers concluding that assembly takes place primarily at high redshift ( e.g. , meza et  al .",
    "2003 ; naab et  al . 2005 ) while others suggest it continues today ( e.g. , de lucia et  al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram of low redshift galaxies provides several important clues about the assembly of red galaxies . at low redshift",
    "there is a tight locus of red galaxies in color - magnitude space ( e.g. , bower , lucey , & ellis 1992 ; hogg et  al .",
    "2004 ; mcintosh et  al .",
    "2005 ) , with the most luminous red galaxies being slightly redder than less luminous red galaxies .",
    "this indicates that red galaxies of a given luminosity and metallicity have similar star formation histories , at least over the last few @xmath16 .",
    "a red galaxy locus is also observed within the @xmath17 cluster and field galaxy populations ( van dokkum et  al .",
    "2000 ; blakeslee et  al . 2003",
    "; bell et  al . 2004 ; willmer et  al .",
    "the absence of very massive star - forming galaxies at low redshifts indicates that the most massive red galaxies are either formed at high redshift or they are assembled via mergers at @xmath11 .",
    "as the colors of red galaxies are a function of luminosity , mergers of red galaxies should produce galaxies slightly blueward of the color - magnitude relation , and thus increase the scatter within the relation .",
    "mergers of red galaxies , perhaps without significant merger - triggered star formation ( dry mergers ) , have been observed at low redshift ( e.g. , lauer 1988 ; van dokkum 2005 ) , but it is unclear how large a role they play in galaxy formation . while there have been valiant attempts to measure the galaxy merger rate with redshift ( e.g. , le fvre et  al . 2000 ;",
    "bell et  al .",
    "2006 ) , there is debate about the selection function of merger candidates and the duration of observable galaxy mergers . at low redshift , measured rates of red galaxy stellar mass growth via mergers span from @xmath18 per @xmath16 ( masjedi et  al .",
    "2006 ) to @xmath19 per @xmath16 ( van dokkum 2005 ) .",
    "the space density of red galaxies with redshift is a relatively direct measure of the galaxy assembly history , and has fewer uncertainties than measurements of the galaxy merger rate . at the redshifts where galaxy assembly takes place , the space density of galaxies as a function of stellar mass will evolve with redshift . while conceptually simple , it is difficult to measure the galaxy space density accurately , as @xmath0 @xmath20 red galaxies are optically faint and their strong spatial clustering ( e.g. , brown et  al .",
    "2003 ) results in significant cosmic variance . despite these difficulties ,",
    "several groups have used measurements of the space density of galaxies with redshift to constrain red galaxy evolution and assembly ( e.g. , lilly et  al .",
    "1995 ; lin et  al . 1999 ; chen et  al . 2003",

    "( 2005 ) provides a useful summary of prior studies , and describes their varying conclusions .",
    "the prior literature provides several plausible scenarios for @xmath11 red galaxy evolution , including passive evolution , assembly via dry mergers , formation from fading blue galaxies , or a combination of the above .",
    "this is the first in a series of papers which will discuss the assembly and evolution of @xmath11 red galaxies detected by the multiwavelength imaging surveys of the entire botes   field .",
    "other papers in this series will measure the stellar mass function , spatial clustering , and agn content of red galaxies . in this paper",
    "we present the evolving @xmath1-band luminosity function of @xmath21 red galaxies , and discuss the resulting implications for red galaxy evolution and assembly . while the rest - frame @xmath1-band is not ideal for tracing stellar mass , it has the advantages of being within the well studied optical wavelength range and remaining within the observed @xmath22 passbands of the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ) for redshifts of @xmath11 .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we provide an overview of the ndwfs and _ spitzer _ irac shallow survey in  [ sec : surveys ] .",

    "the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ) is an optical ( @xmath22 ) and near - infrared ( @xmath28 ) imaging survey of two @xmath29 fields with telescopes of the national optical astronomy observatory ( jannuzi & dey 1999 ) .",
    "a thorough description of the observing strategy and data reduction will be provided by b.  t.  jannuzi et al . and",
    "a.  dey et al .",
    "( both in preparation ) .",
    "we utilize the third ndwfs data release of optical imaging with the mosaic - i camera on the kitt peak 4-m telescope . to obtain accurate optical colors with fixed aperture photometry across the botes  field ,",
    "we have smoothed copies of the released images so the stellar point spread function ( psf ) is a moffat profile with a full width at half maximum of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the subfield @xmath32 ( each subfield is roughly one mosaic - i field - of - view ) has poor seeing in the @xmath33 and @xmath34-bands , and has been excluded from this study .      the irac instrument ( fazio et  al .",
    "2004 ) on the _ spitzer _ space telescope provides simultaneous broad - band images at @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",

    "2005 ; elston et  al .",
    "2006 ; brodwin et  al .",
    "2006 ) . in this paper",
    "we utilize the @xmath35 and @xmath41 imaging to remove contaminants ( e.g. , stars , quasars ) from our galaxy sample and for empirical photometric redshifts . the observed @xmath42 $ ] color of @xmath11 red galaxies is a superb redshift indicator , due to the redshifting of the @xmath43 @xmath44 stellar opacity feature ( e.g. , simpson & eisenhardt 1999 ; sawicki 2002 ) .",
    "we detected sources using sextractor @xmath45 ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) , run in single - image mode on the @xmath46-band images of the ndwfs third data release .",
    "the ndwfs botes  field comprises of 27 optical subfields , each of which are @xmath47 in size , that are are designed to have overlaps of several arcminutes .",
    "individual objects can be detected in multiple subfields , which is particularly useful for photometric calibration , though the effective exposure time generally decreases towards subfield edges .",
    "for this paper , we only include objects which are detected within nominal subfield boundaries , which we define to have overlaps of only tens of arcseconds . in these small overlap regions ,",
    "we search for objects with @xmath46-band detections in multiple subfields and retain the detection with the highest quality data ( i.e. , without bad pixels or with the longest exposure time ) . to minimize the number of faint spurious galaxies in our catalog , we exclude regions surrounding very extended galaxies and saturated stars .",
    "we also exclude regions that do not have good coverage from both the ndwfs and the irac shallow survey .",
    "the final sample area is @xmath2 over a @xmath48 field - of - view .",
    "we used our own code to measure aperture photometry for each object in the optical and irac passbands . to reduce contaminating flux from neighboring objects , we used sextractor segmentation maps to exclude pixels associated with neighboring objects detected in any of the three optical bands .",
    "we corrected the aperture photometry for missing pixels ( from the segmentation maps or bad pixels ) by using the mean flux per pixel measured in a series on @xmath49 wide annuli surrounding each object position .",
    "accurate @xmath50 uncertainties for the photometry were determined by measuring photometry at @xmath51 positions within @xmath52 of the object position and finding the uncertainty which encompassed 68.7% of the measurements .",
    "we also use the median of the fluxes measured at these positions to subtract small errors which could be present in our sky background estimate .",
    "typical random uncertainties for @xmath46-band @xmath53 diameter aperture photometry are @xmath54 magnitudes at @xmath55 , increasing to @xmath56 magnitudes at @xmath57 .",
    "typical random uncertainties for @xmath58 @xmath53 aperture photometry are @xmath59 magnitudes at @xmath60=16 $ ] , increasing to @xmath56 magnitudes at @xmath60=19 $ ] .    to verify the accuracy of our uncertainties and to search for systematic errors , we added artificial galaxies to our data , recovered them with sextractor , and measured their photometry .",
    "the artificial galaxies have ( 1948 ) profiles truncated at seven half - light radii ( though our results are not particularly sensitive to the truncation radius ) , which were then convolved with our psf .",
    "figure  [ fig : sys ] plots the offset between total and measured luminosities for these galaxies .",
    "this offset is due to flux outside outside of our @xmath53 diameter aperture , and is a predictable function of half - light radius .",
    "the observed half - light radius is a function of both galaxy luminosity and redshift , and we discuss corrections from @xmath53 aperture photometry to total magnitudes in  [ sec : rest ] . after accounting for this predicted offset , we find that the difference between the input and measured photometry is within the quoted @xmath50 uncertainties @xmath61 of the time .",
    "it is useful to compare our photometry with sextractor s @xmath62 , which is often used to measure `` total '' magnitudes in galaxy surveys ( e.g. , bell et  al .",
    "2004 ; zucca et  al .",
    "while sextractor is an extremely useful tool for source detection , photometry and classification , it can not be expected to provide perfect measurements of all objects in all surveys . using the same artificial galaxies",
    "as described above , we find 80% of the mag_auto measurements differ from the total magnitude by more than the quoted @xmath50 uncertainty .",
    "this is due to sextractor s assumption that the sky background is gaussian random noise without source confusion , which is only a valid approximation for some imaging data .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : sys ] that mag_auto is closer to a total magnitude than @xmath53 aperture photometry , though it has systematic errors which are a function of apparent magnitude .",
    "in addition , its random errors are 40% larger than @xmath53 aperture photometry . the systematic error with magnitude may be due to the elliptical mag_auto aperture being defined using the second - order image moments of object pixels above an isophotal threshold .",
    "it is therefore plausible that the mag_auto aperture is slightly too small for relatively extended faint galaxies .",
    "luminosity functions using mag_auto for total magnitudes may have systematics of @xmath63 magnitudes at faint magnitudes , though the exact size of this offset will depend both on the imaging data and user defined sextractor parameters .",
    "accurate luminosity functions require corrections for galaxy flux which falls beyond the photometric aperture .",
    "we determined redshifts for our galaxies using the empirical annz photometric redshift code ( firth , lahav , & somerville 2003 ; collister & lahav 2004 ) .",
    "when a sufficiently large training set is available , empirical photometric redshifts are as precise or better than other techniques ( e.g. , csabai et  al .",
    "2003 ; brodwin et  al .",
    "this approach does restrict us to @xmath11 , where thousands of spectroscopic redshifts are available in botes   to calibrate the photometric redshifts .",
    "annz uses artificial neural networks to determine the relationship between measured galaxy properties and redshift .",
    "it does not use any prior assumptions about the shape of galaxy spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , though it does assume the relationship between galaxy properties and redshift is a relatively smooth function .",
    "annz works best when the training set is a large representative subset of the science galaxy sample .",
    "the basis of our training set is galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the botes  field .",
    "the ongoing agn and galaxy evolution survey ( ages , c.  s.  kochanek  et  al .  in preparation ) of botes  has obtained spectroscopic redshifts of @xmath64 @xmath65 galaxies , using the mmt s hectospec multiobject spectrograph ( fabricant et  al .",
    "2005 ) . at fainter magnitudes ,",
    "most of the spectroscopic redshifts are from various spectroscopic campaigns with the w.  m.  keck , gemini , and kitt peak observatories , which have jointly resulted in redshifts for several hundred galaxies .",
    "we trained and measured photometric redshifts using the @xmath53 aperture photometry and the 2nd order moments of the @xmath46-band light distribution . for training and determining photometric redshifts we used @xmath66 magnitudes ( lupton , gunn , & szalay 1999 ) rather than fluxes or conventional @xmath67 magnitudes .",
    "annz does not produce accurate photometric redshifts with fluxes that span a vast dynamic range , while conventional magnitudes only measure positive fluxes .",
    "we only use @xmath66 magnitudes when estimating annz photometric redshifts and use conventional magnitudes throughout the remainder of the paper . the second order",
    "image moments are useful for reducing the number of bright galaxy photometric redshifts with large errors .",
    "in particular , they reduce photometric redshift outliers produced by low redshift edge - on spirals whose dust lanes produce colors similar to higher redshift objects .",
    "as we do not want the shape measurements to be a function of @xmath46-band depth , which varies slightly across botes , we measure the 2nd order moments with pixels above an @xmath46-band surface brightness of @xmath68 .",
    "we applied several restrictions to the training set to improve the photometric redshifts of @xmath11 red galaxies .",
    "we restricted the training set to @xmath69 spectroscopic galaxies , so @xmath70 galaxies did not perturb the annz photometric redshift solution for @xmath69 galaxies . while we include red galaxies with x - ray and radio counterparts in our final sample ,",
    "these objects are overrepresented in our spectroscopic samples and a small fraction of these sources could have unusual colors due to the contribution of the agn .",
    "we have therefore excluded objects with counterparts in the _ chandra _ xbotes   survey ( kenter et  al .",
    "2005 ; murray et  al . 2005 ; brand et  al .",
    "2006 ) or the first radio survey ( becker , white , & helfand 1995 ) from the photometric redshift training set .",
    "the small number of galaxies with unusual apparent colors which remained in the training set were removed with apparent color cuts which are a function of spectroscopic redshift .    at @xmath71",
    ", there are only 280 red and blue galaxies fainter than @xmath72 with spectroscopic redshifts in the training set , which is less than ideal for training annz .",
    "as the shape of the galaxy color - locus at any given redshift is relatively simple and smooth , we were able to increase the size of the training set by adding interpolated objects to the training set .",
    "we did this when we found galaxies within 0.02 in redshift and within 0.5 in @xmath73 color of each other .",
    "as red galaxies at @xmath11 follow relatively tight color - magnitude ( e.g. , bower et  al .",
    "1992 ; bell et  al .",
    "2004 ; mcintosh et  al . 2005 ) and size - luminosity relations ( e.g. , bender , burstein , & faber 1992 ; shen et  al .",
    "2003 ) , we were able to extrapolate the training set to fainter magnitudes by making faint copies of bright objects with slightly altered photometry and image size parameters .",
    "as the colors and sizes of galaxies are a very strong function of redshift , approximations of the color - magnitude and size - luminosity relations at a given redshift are sufficient for the photometric redshift training set .",
    "figure  [ fig : train ] plots the color - color and color - magnitude diagrams of training set galaxies at @xmath74 , along with interpolated and extrapolated objects .    in figure",
    "[ fig : photoz ] we plot the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts of 4314 objects which meet our red galaxy selection criteria ( which we discuss in  [ sec : sample ] ) , including radio and x - ray sources .",
    "we also provide estimates of photometric redshift uncertainties for a series of redshift and apparent magnitude bins in table  [ table : photoz ] .",
    "the uncertainties were determined using the relevant percentiles , and do not assume a gaussian distribution of photometric redshift errors .",
    "as the observed range of galaxy colors broadens with increasing apparent magnitude , at the very least due to photometric errors , the random errors of the photometric redshifts also increase with apparent magnitude .",
    "measured systematic errors are much smaller than the random errors listed in table  [ table : photoz ] .",
    "the accuracy of our red galaxy photometric redshifts are comparable to the best broad - band photometric redshifts available in the literature ( e.g. , mobasher et  al .",
    "the @xmath50 uncertainties of our photometric redshifts are @xmath75 in redshift at @xmath76 , and this decreases to @xmath77 at @xmath78 .      to measure the rest - frame absolute magnitudes and colors of ndwfs galaxies , we used maximum likelihood fits of & charlot ( 2003 ) sed models to the @xmath22 @xmath53 diameter aperture photometry . throughout this paper",
    "we use solar metallicity models with a ( 1955 ) initial mass function , a formation redshift of @xmath79 , and exponentially declining star formation rates .",
    "these models provide a reasonable approximation of the observed seds of red galaxies . unlike empirical templates ,",
    "the & charlot ( 2003 ) models allow us to estimate stellar masses and star formation rates , which we will use in future papers ( k.  brand  et  al . and a.  dey  et  al . , both in preparation ) . for this paper",
    ", we will only use the rest - frame optical colors and absolute magnitudes .",
    "other stellar population models can be fitted to red galaxies , though changing models has little impact on our @xmath1-band luminosity functions and our conclusions .",
    "shifting the formation redshift results in different @xmath80 models being fitted to the red galaxies , but the model @xmath1-band luminosity evolution of red galaxy stellar populations at @xmath11 changes by @xmath81 magnitudes or less . changing from a ( 1955 ) to a ( 2003 ) initial mass function decreases",
    "galaxy stellar masses by 25% , but has little impact on the predicted evolution of galaxy optical colors and luminosities .",
    "models with low metallicities are bluer than the reddest galaxies , while models with 1.5 times solar metallicity are offset from observed @xmath22 galaxy loci from @xmath82 to @xmath83 .    as with all current galaxy sed templates and models , there are small systematic errors .",
    "the @xmath80 models do not perfectly match the evolving rest - frame @xmath84 colors of red galaxies at all redshifts , and the @xmath80 models overestimate the apparent @xmath85 colors of @xmath86 red galaxies by @xmath87 magnitudes . as discussed in  [ sec : litcomp ] , we expect these systematics to have a modest impact on our luminosity functions .",
    "the @xmath53 aperture photometry captures 86% or less of the total flux .",

    "2003 ) and assume @xmath91 ( fukugita , shimasaku , & ichikawa 1995 ) , so @xmath92=1.0 - 0.26(m_b-5{\\rm logh}+21.81).\\ ] ] the @xmath50 dispersion around this relation is only @xmath93 for the most luminous red galaxies ( shen et  al .",
    "2003 ) , while the offsets between @xmath53 and total magnitudes in figure  [ fig : sys ] are a relatively weak function of half - light radius .",
    "this simple relation should therefore provide accurate corrections between @xmath53 aperture and total photometry .",
    "the size - luminosity relation must change with redshift due to the evolution of red galaxy stellar populations .",
    "we assume the size - luminosity relation undergoes pure luminosity evolution described by a & charlot ( 2003 ) @xmath94 stellar synthesis model with a formation redshift of @xmath79 .",
    "this model fades by @xmath95 @xmath1-band magnitudes between @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : uvz ] , the @xmath94 model approximates the color evolution of @xmath96 red galaxies .",
    "the luminosity evolution of the fundamental plane for @xmath97 early - type galaxies ( e.g. , van dokkum & stanford 2003 ; treu et  al .",
    "2005 ) is also comparable to this model , though less luminous galaxies probably exhibit more rapid luminosity function ( treu et  al . 2005 ; van der wel et  al .",
    "stellar population synthesis models with @xmath98 have less than @xmath99 of their total star formation at @xmath11 . while this is a tiny amount of star formation , it does result in more rest - frame color and luminosity evolution than passive evolution models without any @xmath11 star formation .",
    "changing the value of @xmath80 by @xmath100 alters the model @xmath0 rest - frame @xmath84 colors and @xmath1-band luminosity evolution by @xmath75 magnitudes . after accounting for the evolving size - luminosity relation and our @xmath30 point spread function , we find the @xmath53 diameter aperture captures 75% of the flux of a @xmath101 galaxy at @xmath102 .",
    "red galaxies do not exclusively have ( 1948 ) profiles ( e.g. , blanton et  al . 2003 ; driver et  al .",
    "2006 ) , and this could affect our estimates of galaxy total magnitudes . to investigate this , we determined the offsets between @xmath53 aperture and total magnitudes for ( 1968 ) profiles with indices between 2 and 6 . for galaxies with half - light radii of @xmath103 ,",
    "the offset differs from that determined with a ( 1948 ) profile by @xmath54 magnitudes . changing the truncation radius from @xmath104 to @xmath105 half - light radii",
    "only changes the offset between @xmath53 aperture and total magnitudes by @xmath106 magnitudes for galaxies with @xmath107 .",
    "this offset can be increased by using larger truncation radii , though this results in a systematic difference between the model and measured offset of @xmath53 and @xmath108 aperture photometry for red galaxies .",
    "as the expected evolution of red galaxy stellar populations is on the order of @xmath95 @xmath1-band magnitudes per unit redshift , small errors in our corrections from @xmath53 aperture to total magnitudes should have little impact upon our results and conclusions .    to verify the accuracy of our model , we compared the measured and predicted difference between @xmath53 and @xmath108 aperture photometry for red galaxies .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : ap46 ] , our simple model provides a good approximation of what is observed in our red galaxy sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : ap46 ] also illustrates the absolute magnitude dependence of our model .",
    "this dependence results in the aperture corrections at fixed _ apparent _ @xmath46-band magnitude increasing with redshift .",
    "it is therefore plausible that an estimator of total magnitudes could work well for the majority of @xmath55 galaxies , which are at @xmath109 , but have systematic errors for @xmath55 galaxies at @xmath102 .",
    "accounting for flux outside the aperture is crucial for measuring the total magnitudes of @xmath11 galaxies .",
    "the rest - frame distribution of galaxy colors is bimodal ( e.g. , hogg et  al .",
    "2004 ) , and selection criteria for red galaxies typically fall near the minimum between the red and blue galaxy populations ( e.g. , madgwick et  al . 2002 ; bell et  al . 2004 ; faber et  al .",
    "we apply a similar approach for this work , and use the following rest - frame color selection criterion ; @xmath110 our criterion selects galaxies with rest - frame @xmath84 colors within @xmath111 magnitudes of the evolving color - magnitude relation of red galaxies .",
    "this criterion allows comparison with the recent literature and is very similar , though not identical , to the criterion of ( 2004 ) .",
    "our selection criterion is plotted in figure  [ fig : cmr ] along with the observed color distribution of red galaxies .",
    "our selection criterion has slightly more tilt than the observed color - magnitude relation of @xmath112 red galaxies .",
    "if we use @xmath113 aperture photometry instead of @xmath53 aperture photometry , the observed color - magnitude relation of @xmath112 red galaxies moves blueward and steepens .",
    "however , as this has little impact upon the measured luminosity function , we continue to use @xmath53 aperture photometry , which has smaller random uncertainties than @xmath113 aperture photometry .",
    "the measured space density of the most luminous red galaxies does not depend on the details of our selection criterion , as these galaxies mostly lie along the color - magnitude relation .",
    "we can therefore easily compare our luminosity functions for @xmath114 red galaxies with those of 2dfgrs , sdss , combo-17 , and deep2 ( madgwick et  al .",
    "2002 ; bell et  al . 2004",
    "; faber et  al . 2005 ; willmer et  al .",
    "2005 ; blanton 2005 ) , all of which use slightly different galaxy selection criteria .",
    "the fraction of blue galaxies increases with decreasing luminosity , so the measured space density of @xmath9 red galaxies is a stronger function of the red galaxy selection criteria .",
    "if we shift our criterion blueward by @xmath115 magnitudes our measured space density of @xmath116 red galaxies increases by @xmath117 .",
    "we limit the absolute magnitude range in each of our redshift bins so we can determine accurate redshifts and have a highly complete sample .",
    "almost all of the galaxies in our final sample are detected in @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath46 and the two irac bands . to evaluate the completeness of our sample , we added artificial galaxies to copies of the @xmath46-band images and recovered them with sextractor .",
    "the artificial galaxies had ( 1948 ) profiles truncated at 7 effective radii , and we measure the completeness for a range of effective radii and apparent magnitudes . as illustrated in figure  [ fig : comp ] , our catalogs are more than 85% complete for @xmath118 galaxies with half - light radii of @xmath49 or less .",
    "our measurements of the luminosity function , which we discuss in  [ sec : lf ] , include small corrections for this incompleteness .",
    "contaminants can not be rejected from photometric redshift surveys on the basis of their spectra , so these surveys can be more susceptible to contaminants than comparable spectroscopic surveys .",
    "this contamination can include stars , quasars , and galaxies with large photometric redshift errors .",
    "we therefore apply apparent color and morphology cuts to minimize contamination while retaining a highly complete sample of red galaxies .",
    "we have applied apparent color cuts to exclude objects whose colors differ from those expected for @xmath21 red galaxies .",
    "these color cuts are designed to remove most stars , quasars and @xmath119 galaxies from our sample .",
    "our cuts may exclude a small percentage of red galaxies with unusually large photometric errors , but as these galaxies could also have large redshift and luminosity errors , it is preferable to exclude them from our measurement of the luminosity function . as the distribution of red galaxy apparent colors does not form a simple shape in color space , we use a total 17 color cuts to exclude objects from the sample .",

    "red galaxies at @xmath3 may have their luminosities systematically underestimated by @xmath207 magnitudes by deep2 , and we therefore conclude that different measures of total magnitudes contribute to the difference between our work and the prior literature .",
    "different surveys use different sed models and templates to derive rest - frame galaxy properties from observed photometry .",
    "figure  [ fig : kin ] compares rest - frame magnitudes and colors derived with the & charlot ( 2003 ) @xmath80 models and ( 1996 ) templates for our red galaxy sample .",
    "the absolute magnitudes exhibit small differences , as the observed @xmath46-band is very close to the rest - frame @xmath1-band at @xmath102 .",
    "in contrast , the rest - frame @xmath84 colors show systematics as large as 0.2 magnitudes .",
    "this will have minimal impact on the bright end of the luminosity function , as the most luminous red galaxies lie along the color - magnitude relation , which can be identified empirically .",
    "the greatest impact from sed errors will be at lower luminosities , as sed errors will shift red galaxy selection criterion relative to the the color - magnitude relation . a @xmath81 magnitude shift in our @xmath84 selection criterion results in our @xmath130 and @xmath138 values changing by @xmath208 .",
    "if the ( 1996 ) templates are better models of @xmath3 red galaxy seds than the & charlot ( 2003 ) @xmath80 models , our principal conclusions remain unchanged .",
    "the @xmath84 color - magnitude relation still evolves , but the mean color and luminosity of red galaxy stellar populations evolves less rapidly than predicted by the @xmath94 model .",
    "even if our @xmath102 @xmath138 measurement has a @xmath209 error , the stellar mass contained within the red galaxy population must increase with decreasing redshift . if we reduce the luminosity evolution of red galaxy stellar populations , a revised @xmath178 model without mergers will provide a better fit to the observations in figure  [ fig : m ] than our current model .",
    "we have measured the evolution and assembly of red galaxies over the last @xmath8 , using the evolving @xmath1-band luminosity function of @xmath21 red galaxies .",
    "our sample of 39599 @xmath21 red galaxies , selected from @xmath2 of imaging , is an order of magnitude larger in size and volume than comparable @xmath3 red galaxy samples .",
    "accurate photometric redshifts were determined using the empirical annz photometric redshift code and photometry from both the noao deep wide - field and _ spitzer _ irac shallow surveys .",
    "the accuracy of these redshifts has been verified with spectroscopy , and is comparable to the best broad - band photometric redshifts in the literature .",
    "we find the color - magnitude and size - luminosity relations of red galaxies evolve with redshift , and this evolution can be approximated by a & charlot ( 2003 ) @xmath94 stellar population synthesis model .",
    "the size - luminosity relation predicts a significant fraction of the galaxy flux is at radii of several arcseconds , even at @xmath3 .",
    "luminosity functions which do not account for this underestimate the space density of red galaxies at high redshift , and overestimate the assembly rate of red galaxies at @xmath11 .",
    "we find the luminosity density , @xmath138 , of red galaxies increases by @xmath168 from @xmath6 to @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath1-band luminosity of a @xmath94 stellar population model increases by 213% over the same redshift range . if red galaxy stellar populations fade by @xmath95 magnitudes from @xmath0 to @xmath6 , the stellar mass contained within red galaxies has approximately doubled over the past @xmath8 .",
    "blue galaxies are being transformed into @xmath9 red galaxies at @xmath11 , after a steady decline or rapid truncation of their star formation .",
    "the evolution of the most luminous red galaxies at @xmath11 can not be dominated by fading blue galaxies , as blue galaxies with large stellar masses are exceptionally rare at @xmath11 .",
    "we have measured the evolution of @xmath13 red galaxies using @xmath178 , the absolute magnitude corresponding to a fixed space density of @xmath210 .",
    "our measurements of @xmath178 , along with those we derived from the literature , show that the stellar masses of the most luminous red galaxies evolve slowly at @xmath11 .",
    "a & charlot ( 2003 ) @xmath94 model , with little stellar mass evolution and normalized to the 2dfgrs , only overestimates @xmath178 by @xmath211 magnitudes at @xmath14 .",
    "we therefore conclude that @xmath12 of the stellar mass contained within today s @xmath212 red galaxies was already in place within these galaxies at @xmath14 . while red galaxy mergers have been reported in the prior literature , such mergers do not rapidly increase the stellar masses of @xmath13 red galaxies between @xmath0 and the present day .",
