    "this type of stochastic motion was introduced by matheron and de marsily ( mdm)@xcite to describe the hydrodynamic dispersion of dynamically - neutral tracer in a sedimentary layered rock formation .",
    "although the longitudinal bias averaged over an infinite number of transverse layers is zero , the typical bias over a finite number of layers is a fluctuating quantity which is a decreasing function of the number of layers that a random walk visits .",
    "this non - vanishing residual bias underlies the faster than diffusive transport of the model . in an infinite system",
    "it has been established that the typical horizontal displacement @xmath16@xcite and that the configuration averaged distribution of longitudinal displacements has the form @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "there are also strong fluctuations in the probability distribution between different samples of the velocity field , as well as a very slow convergence to the asymptotic limit .",

    "the survival probability in a finite system with absorbing boundaries at @xmath18 and the same unidirectional random velocity field has been studied previously@xcite ; however this system exhibits fundamentally different behavior than the semi - infinite system that is treated here .    in the absence of a velocity field",
    ", it is well known that in the semi - infinite system @xmath0 asymptotically decays in time as @xmath19@xcite . because the velocity field in the mdm model has no net longitudinal bias , it is not immediately obvious how the behavior of @xmath0 will be affected .",
    "naively , one might expect that the dominant contribution to @xmath0 will arise from those velocity configurations whose average bias is directed away from the boundary .",
    "this is indeed the case , and from this starting point , we present a simple argument which suggests that the survival probability , averaged over all realization of the velocity field , is proportional to @xmath20 .",
    "this prediction is in excellent agreement with our numerical results .",
    "= 2.5in=1.95 in 0.3 in 0.15 in    interestingly , a @xmath20 decay of the survival probability has been found previously for diffusing particles in a semi - infinite two dimensional system with a unidirectional zero - bias , but deterministic velocity field of the form @xmath21@xcite .",
    "although the mechanism that leads to @xmath5 in this class of velocity fields is different than that for the mdm model , the two systems share the feature that their velocity fields have no average bias in @xmath22 .",
    "it would be interesting to determine whether a @xmath20 decay of the survival probability is characteristic of all semi - infinite systems with a zero - mean longitudinal velocity field .    in the next section ,",
    "we give a heuristic argument which suggests that @xmath23 .",
    "we then present corroborating numerical simulations in sec .",
    "we also find that the spatial probability distribution of the surviving particles provides insight into the formulation of a continuum equation of motion for the longitudinal probability distribution in an unbounded geometry .",

    "iv , we infer this equation of motion and , from its solution , determine the correct asymptotic longitudinal probability distribution in the unbounded geometry .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion in sec .",
    "we first present our argument for the the time dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "the basic idea is that the dominant contribution to this average arises from the subset of all velocity configurations whose net bias is away from the boundary , _",
    "i.  e. _ , in the @xmath24-direction .",
    "conversely , configurations with a bias along @xmath25 will give individual contributions to @xmath0 which decay exponentially in time and thus should be asymptotically negligible .    to determine which of the positively - biased velocity configurations give the dominant contribution to @xmath0 ,",
    "consider a discrete realization of the mdm model on the square lattice in which the velocity is either @xmath26 or @xmath27 with equal probability for a given value of @xmath2 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions in the transverse direction are employed , so that the system is a semi - infinite cylinder consisting of @xmath28 rows . for concreteness ,",
    "the initial condition is @xmath29 , _ i.  e. _ , a ring of particles is initially placed at @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the lattice spacing . in this system ,",
    "the probability that there are @xmath32 positively biased rows and @xmath33 negatively biased rows is @xmath34 , with @xmath35 . in a time @xmath36 , the number of layers visited by a random walk is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the transverse ( microscopic ) diffusivity . by transforming from @xmath39 to the velocity @xmath40 ,",
    "the distribution of velocities within @xmath28 layers is @xmath41 .",
    "\\label{pv}\\ ] ] because this distribution is strongly cut off when the argument of the exponential is greater than one , we expect that the dominant contribution to @xmath0 will arise from those velocity configurations whose net bias is within the range @xmath42 .    for a positively biased velocity configuration",
    ", we now estimate the residual survival probability in the long time limit under the assumption that @xmath28 is finite . in this case",
    ", the particle will uniformly sample the transverse extent of the system and it is sensible to characterize the bias by its mean value @xmath43 . if @xmath43 is small , or more properly the peclet number @xmath44 is small , then for @xmath45 the bias is irrelevant and consequently @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the initial position of the particle@xcite .",
    "however , for @xmath48 , convection dominates and returns to the origin become extremely unlikely .",
    "hence @xmath0 should `` stick '' at the value attained when @xmath49 .",
    "this implies that the asymptotic behavior of the survival probability is simply , @xmath50 .",
    "this same result can also be obtained with additional effort from a more rigorous approach in which one solves the one - dimensional convection - diffusion equation on the domain @xmath3 with the initial condition @xmath51 and then computes @xmath0 by integrating this probability density over all @xmath3 .    for the mdm model",

    "we now present numerical evidence to support the prediction that @xmath23 . for simulating the particle motion ,",
    "we propagate the probability distribution for each velocity configuration exactly@xcite .",
    "the microscopic motion is defined by the rule that in a single time step , a particle hops equiprobably by @xmath53 in the @xmath2-direction and by a distance sign@xmath54 in the @xmath22-direction on the square lattice , where @xmath55 is the velocity field at the @xmath2-coordinate of the particle before the hopping event ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "accordingly , the probability that a particle is at @xmath56 at time @xmath36 evolves according to @xmath57 for each velocity configuration , probability propagation yields the exact distribution in the presence of the absorbing boundary up to the maximum time specified .",
    "we have performed the average over velocity configurations in two complementary ways  either an average over a representative sample of velocity configurations , or an exhaustive average over all velocity configurations for relatively small systems .",
    "the former is straightforward to implement , but the effect of rare configurations on the results is unknown .",
    "the latter , on the other hand , gives the exact result for an infinite system , albeit only for short times .",
    "this exactness allows one to test for systematic trends in the data , an analysis which is not feasible when averaging over a representative set of velocity configurations .    a typical result for @xmath0 up to @xmath58 , based on an average over 50 velocity configurations on a cylinder of width 400 , is shown in fig .  2",
    "the average bias of these 50 configurations turns out to be @xmath59 . beyond approximately 50 time steps ,",
    "the data for the survival probability is quite linear and a least - squares power law fit to the data in this time range yields the exponent of @xmath60 .",
    "further , the slope between successive data points , or local exponent estimate @xmath61 deviates from @xmath62 by less than 0.002 for @xmath63 ( inset ) . to check",
    "that finite width effects do not substantially affect the results , we also considered shorter times , @xmath64 and a slightly narrower system ( @xmath65 ) , and averaged over 250 realizations .",
    "the average bias of these configurations turns out to be @xmath66 .",
    "this case yielded a best fit exponent of @xmath67 .",
    "these two data sets strongly suggest that @xmath23 in the long time limit .",
    "however , because the average is performed only over an infinitesimal fraction of all velocity configurations , it is possible that extreme configurations could alter the results .",
    "for this reason , we now investigate the exact behavior of @xmath0 for short times by averaging over all velocity configurations .",
    "= 3.0in=3.0 in 0.05 in 0.1 in    in this complete enumeration , we consider odd values of @xmath28 for convenience . because of the periodic transverse boundary conditions , many of the @xmath68 configurations are identical up to cyclic permutation and reflection symmetry . to carry out the enumeration , we first encode each velocity configuration as a binary sequence . using bit manipulation techniques",
    ", we identify the `` irreducible '' representation of this binary sequence , defined as the smallest equivalent integer number obtained by performing all possible cyclic permutations of the initial binary sequence .",
    "this same procedure is then repeated on the reversed initial binary sequence .",
    "thus to each binary sequence there is a unique irreducible binary sequence . by this mapping",
    ", we only need consider the irreducible configurations and weight each by their degeneracy in performing the average over velocity configurations .",
    "for example for @xmath69 , 25 , 27 , and 29 , the number of irreducible configurations are 92,205 , 337,594 , 1,246863 , and 4,636,390 , compared , _",
    "e.  g. _ , to @xmath70 . for each irreducible configuration",
    ", we then perform the exact probability distribution propagation .",
    "this complete enumeration provides the exact value of @xmath0 for an infinite system up to @xmath71 time steps , while finite width crossover effects gradually begin to play a role for later times .",
    "= 3.0in=3.0 in 0.05 in 0.1 in    we therefore typically carried out the probability propagation for up to @xmath72 time steps and exploited the crossover in @xmath0 to interpret our results .",
    "a plot of @xmath73 versus @xmath74 should initially show power law behavior , indicative of the infinite system behavior , and then cross over to a non - zero constant because of finite width effects .",
    "thus a plot of the local exponent @xmath75 ( here defined as the slope between every other data point ) versus @xmath76 should initially provide an estimate of the exponent of @xmath0 , while the crossover effect determines the time range over which the exact data is relevant for the infinite system . in fig .",
    "3 , this local slope , is plotted versus @xmath76 for system widths @xmath28 between 15 and 29 .",
    "initially , @xmath75 is decreasing nearly linearly in @xmath76 , but subsequently there is the expected crossover to the asymptotic value of zero . in the regime where the data is relatively linear ,",
    "we compute the intercepts of successive data points at @xmath77 as an estimate of the asymptotic value of the exponent ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "as @xmath28 increases , this data exhibits : ( i ) non - monotonic trends in the data ( _ e .",
    "g. _ , the location of the minimum ) which disappear only for @xmath78 , ( ii ) more stable extrapolated values as @xmath28 increases , and ( iii ) the minimum value of the extrapolated exponent  which we adopt as the best estimate of the exponent for a given value of @xmath28  is increasing systematically in @xmath28 and appears to be converging to @xmath62 . while there is slow convergence to asymptotic behavior which gives rise to considerable subjectivity in analysis , we believe that the trends in the data support the hypothesis that @xmath79 .",
    "= 3.0in=3.0 in 0.05 in 0.1 in",
    "in addition to investigating @xmath0 , we also examined the probability distribution of the surviving particles .",
    "this quantity provides an alternative understanding for the first - passage process , as well as useful fundamental insights about the continuum description of mdm model .",
    "specifically , we study @xmath80 , the configuration averaged longitudinal probability distribution of particles which have not yet been absorbed by time @xmath36 .",
    "we expect that this probability distribution can be written in a scaling form    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the average longitudinal displacement of the survivors at time @xmath36 .",
    "monte carlo simulations clearly indicate that @xmath83 , as in the case when there is no absorbing boundary present@xcite . because @xmath84 , we can determine the coefficient @xmath85 by integrating eq .",
    "( [ pxt ] ) over @xmath22 and thereby write @xmath86 where @xmath87 . because of the absorbing boundary , @xmath88 must equal zero , leading to the expectation that @xmath89 will vanish as a power law as @xmath12 . consequently",
    ", we write @xmath90 with @xmath91 as @xmath12 , and @xmath10 vanishing faster than any power law for @xmath14 .    a plot of the scaling function @xmath89 versus @xmath92 is shown in fig .  4 for @xmath93 , 1023 , and 4095",
    "there is a small but systematic variation in the data for different times , with the small-@xmath92 behavior steepening and the large-@xmath92 tail growing for larger time .",
    "nevertheless , reasonable data collapse is obtained in which @xmath89 qualitatively exhibits the expected power - law and rapid cutoff asymptotic behaviors for small and large @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "we attribute the small deviation from scaling on slow convergence to the asymptotic limit ( see below ) .",
    "such a phenomenon was observed previously in the probability distribution for an infinite system@xcite , and similar slow convergence effects can be anticipated here as well .",
    "= 3.0in=3.0 in 0.05 in 0.1 in    the exponent @xmath94 in eq .",
    "( [ bpxt ] ) can be obtained by demanding consistency between the time dependence of @xmath0 and that of the first - passage probability . if @xmath23 , then from the general relation@xcite between @xmath0 and the first passage probability to the boundary , @xmath95 , we have @xmath96 . on the other hand for a normalized initial condition ,",
    "the first passage probability coincides with the flux to @xmath4 .",
    "now as @xmath97 , eq .",
    "( [ bpxt ] ) gives @xmath98 since the flux is obtained by performing an appropriate spatial derivative of this limiting probability distribution , an operation which does not affect the temporal behavior , we conclude that @xmath99 to recover the correct @xmath9 time dependence for the flux .",
    "however , the data in fig .  5 does not exhibit this behavior because of finite time effects . for small @xmath92 ,",
    "the numerical value of @xmath10 at @xmath100 is non - zero but decreasing with time .",
    "correspondingly , the value of @xmath92 at this first data point is non - zero but also decreasing with time .",
    "this anomaly in the small-@xmath92 data renders a simple power law fit inadequate .",
    "however , such a naive fit to the data in the range @xmath101 gives the estimates 0.483 , 0.479 , 0.476 , 0.470 , and 0.464 , respectively , for the exponent @xmath94 in @xmath8 for the 5 aforementioned time values .",
    "other analyses , such as computing the first derivative of @xmath89 ( which should diverge as @xmath102 ) and determining the exponent of the small-@xmath92 dependence , lead to a similar quantitative conclusion . while the anticipated value @xmath99 is not obtained , we believe that better agreement with theory would emerge if it were practical to extend our monte carlo simulations to much longer times .",
    "the existence of this power - law prefactor further suggests that in a continuum description , the configuration averaged flux can be obtained via @xmath103 such a scale - dependent diffusivity can be heuristically justified by appealing to a taylor diffusion description of the motion in the mdm model@xcite . in a time @xmath36 , a particle typically explores @xmath104 transverse layers .",
    "the typical bias within this number of layers is then proportional to @xmath105 or @xmath106 .",
    "thus in a time scale @xmath36 , the typical longitudinal distance travelled by a particle is @xmath107 .",
    "because these segments of length @xmath108 are randomly in the @xmath24 or @xmath25 direction and the time interval between segments is of order @xmath36 , we infer an effective longitudinal diffusion ( or dispersion ) coefficient @xmath109 , as written in eq .",
    "( [ fluxa ] ) .",
    "let us now pursue the consequences of this scale dependent diffusion coefficient for the longitudinal motion . if the longitudinal flux @xmath110 is indeed proportional to @xmath111 , then substituting this into the continuity equation @xmath112 leads to the effective equation of motion @xmath113 we can easily solve this equation by applying scaling . assuming that @xmath114 , we rewrite the partial derivatives in @xmath22 and @xmath36 in terms of a derivative with respect to @xmath115 , to recast the equation of motion as @xmath116 here the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath92 .",
    "one integration immediately yields @xmath117 the constant of integration equals zero because @xmath118 faster than any power law as @xmath14 .",
    "a second integration then gives @xmath119 , from which we conclude that the longitudinal probability distribution has the form @xmath120 this functional form coincides with that obtained previously by a different method@xcite in which the dominant contribution to the large-@xmath92 tail of @xmath8 arises from extreme `` stretched '' trajectories in unlikely velocity configurations .",
    "thus the observation of the large-@xmath92 tail for @xmath8 from the numerical data in fig .",
    "5 can again be anticipated to be problematical ; much more extensive simulation would be needed .",
    "we have investigated the time dependence of the configuration averaged survival probability , @xmath0 , in a semi - infinite two - dimensional system for diffusing particles which are also driven by a unidirectional random zero - mean velocity field , @xmath1 .",
    "a qualitative argument suggests that @xmath23 , a prediction which is in excellent agreement with numerical results .",
    "we also examined the longitudinal spatial probability density of the surviving particles , @xmath8 .",
    "interestingly , although the numerical evidence supporting the prediction that @xmath121 is strong , the numerical data for @xmath8 indicates slow convergence to the scaling limit and some inconsistency with the behavior of @xmath0 itself .",
    "similar anomalies in the probability distribution occur in the unbounded geometry@xcite , due to the contribution of extreme velocity configurations in the average .",
    "it is surprising that the behavior of @xmath0 is apparently relatively insensitive to the contribution of such extreme configurations .",
    "an interesting byproduct of the spatial distribution of the surviving particles is that the form @xmath122 is suggested as the appropriate expression for the particle flux .",

    "it will be worthwhile to test this prediction and also the general prescription for obtaining an effective equation of motion from the behavior of the particle flux near an absorbing boundary .",
    "finally , the behavior of @xmath0 for a semi - infinite system with a longitudinal mdm velocity field can be easily generalized to arbitrary spatial dimension @xmath108 . from classical results@xcite ,",
