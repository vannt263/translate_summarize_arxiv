    "the reasons for interest in @xmath7 radiative decays are manifold .",
    "these decays yield information on low energy hadron physics , providing insight into the controversial issue of @xmath4 mixing . from the experimental side ,",
    "new data are expected from the kloe experiment at the da@xmath8ne @xmath7-factory@xcite , where a large sample of @xmath7 decays will be collected , which will considerably improve the presently available statistics@xcite .    in the following",
    "we study @xmath0 , @xmath1 decays using qcd sum - rules@xcite . after surveying @xmath9 mixing",
    ", we consider the coupling of the strange pseudoscalar current to @xmath5 and @xmath6 , preliminary to our analysis of @xmath7 decays .",
    "though we work with interpolating currents defined in the quark flavour basis , our results do not depend on any mixing scheme , providing mixing scheme independent qcd predictions .",
    "+ we also consider the coupling of @xmath5 and @xmath6 to the strange and non - strange axial currents , identifying the results with the decay constants in the flavour basis mixing scheme and estimating the mixing parameters .",
    "finally , we give conclusions .",
    "@xmath4 mixing is a much debated subject .",
    "the once conventional description introduced a single mixing angle in the octet - singlet flavour basis@xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been shown@xcite that a proper treatment requires two angles with a redefinition of the particle decay constants .",
    "an equivalent description adopts the quark - flavour basis instead of the octet - singlet one@xcite , in which such constants are defined as : @xmath10 with @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "the decay constants are written according to the following mixing pattern : @xmath13 feldmann@xcite has shown that , since @xmath14 , this mixing framework is simpler , being specified quite accurately in terms of a single angle @xmath15 .",
    "let us define : @xmath16 , and compute this quantity using qcd sum - rules starting from the two - point correlator : @xmath17|0 > \\label{cor_a}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 .",
    "the correlator ( [ cor_a ] ) is given by the dispersive representation : @xmath19 for low values of @xmath20 , @xmath21 receives contribution from the coupling of the @xmath5 to the pseudoscalar current",
    ". hence we can write ( we discuss later possible subtractions ) : @xmath22 assuming that higher contributions start from an effective threshold @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 can also be computed in qcd by expanding the @xmath25-product in ( [ cor_a ] ) by an operator product expansion as the sum of a perturbative term plus non - perturbative ones proportional to vacuum condensates .",
    "dispersively writing the perturbative term too , we have : @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 are computed in qcd .",
    "now we implement quark - hadron duality , assuming that @xmath30 and @xmath31 give the same result when integrated above @xmath23 .",
    "this leads to the sum - rule : @xmath32 now we apply to both sides of ( [ sr ] ) a borel transform , defined as @xmath33=lim_{q^2 \\to \\infty , \\ ; n \\to \\infty , \\ ; { q^2 \\over n}=m^2}\\ ; { 1 \\over ( n-1 ) ! } ( -q^2)^n \\left({d \\over dq^2 } \\right)^n f(q^2 ) \\ ; , \\label{tborel}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is a generic function of @xmath35 and @xmath36 is known as the borel parameter .",
    "this operation improves the convergence of the sum rule and eliminates the contribution of subtraction terms in ( [ disp ] ) .",

    "we vary the strange quark mass in the range : @xmath44 gev@xcite and @xmath23 below the @xmath6 pole between @xmath45 gev@xmath46 .",
    "since @xmath36 is an unphysical parameter , we look for a range of its values ( stability window \" ) where the sum - rule is almost independent of @xmath36 .",
    "we fix @xmath36 in @xmath47 $ ] gev@xmath46 and , considering the uncertainty on @xmath48 and on @xmath23 , we get@xcite : @xmath49 let us now consider : @xmath50 . an analogous calculation gives : @xmath51 \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have raised the threshold up to @xmath52 as to pick up the @xmath6 pole too . using @xmath53 gev and in the stability window",
    "@xmath54 $ ] gev@xmath46 for @xmath36 , we obtain@xcite : @xmath55",

    "we compute @xmath77 for negative values of @xmath76 , and then extrapolate the result to @xmath78 . and @xmath79 , which allows us to remove single poles in the @xmath68 and @xmath69 channels ( `` parasitic '' terms ) . ] since we only know the magnitude of @xmath56 , it is @xmath80 that is determined .",
    "we use : @xmath81 gev , @xmath82 gev ( obtained from the experimental datum on @xmath83@xcite ) .",
    "we use two values of the @xmath7 threshold : @xmath84 gev@xmath46 ; the @xmath5 threshold is chosen as in section  3 .",
    "the extrapolation to @xmath78 gives @xmath85 ; the uncertainty is obtained varying all the input parameters in the sum rule . from this result",
