    "social networking services are widely used in modern society as illustrated by the alexa s top 500 global sites statistics where _ facebook _ and _ linkedin _ rank @xmath18nd and @xmath19th respectively in 2014 .",
    "such popularity has enabled governments and third - party enterprises to massively collect social network data , which eventually can be released for mining and analysis purposes .",
    "the power of social network analysis is questionless .",
    "it might uncover previously unknown knowledge such as community - based problem , media use , individual engagement , amongst others .",
    "sociology is a trivial example of a field that certainly benefits from social graphs publication .",
    "many other fields ( _ e.g. , _ economics , geography , or political science ) and systems ( _ e.g. , _ service - oriented systems , advertisers , or recommended systems ) improve their decisions , processes , and services , based on users interaction .    however , all these benefits are not cost - free .",
    "an adversary can compromise users privacy using the published social network , which results in the disclosure of sensitive data such as e - mails , instant messages , or relationships . a simple and popular approach to prevent",
    "this privacy problem is _ anonymization _ by means of removing potential identifying attributes .",
    "doing so , aggregate knowledge still can be inferred ( _ e.g. , _ connectivity , distance , or node degrees ) while the `` who '' information has been removed . in practice , however , this naive approach is not enough for protecting users privacy .",
    "what makes social network anonymization a challenging problem is the combination of the adversary s background knowledge with the released structure of the network . considering a social network as a simple graph , in which individuals are represented by vertices and their bidirectional relationships by edges , the adversary s background knowledge about a victim may take many forms , _",
    "e.g. , _ vertex degrees , connectivity , or local neighborhood .",
    "this structural knowledge , together with the released graph , is often enough to perform _ passive attacks _ where the users and their relationships are re - identified  @xcite .",
    "other privacy attacks exist . in 2007 , backstrom _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced _ active attacks _ based on the creation and insertion in the network of _ attacker nodes _ controlled by the adversary .",
    "the attacker nodes could be either new accounts with pseudonymous or spoofed identities ( sybil nodes ) , or legitimate users in the network who collude with the adversary .",
    "attacker nodes establish links with other nodes in the network ( also between themselves ) aiming at creating a sort of fingerprint in the network .",
    "once the social graph is released , the adversary just need to retrieve such a fingerprint ( the attacker nodes ) and use it as a hub to re - identify other nodes in the network .",
    "backstrom et .",
    "al . proved that @xmath20 attacker nodes in the network can compromise the privacy of arbitrary targeted nodes with high probability , which makes active attack particularly dangerous .",
    "several active attacks to social graphs have been proposed .",
    "they could even target random nodes in the network as recently shown in @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , no privacy measure aimed at evaluating the resistance of a social graph to this kind of attack exists .",
    "the lack of such a measure prevents the development of privacy - preserving methods with theoretically proven privacy guarantees .    in this article",
    "we define _",
    "@xmath0-anonymity _ ; a privacy measure that can be applied to real - life social graphs in order to measure their resistance to active attacks .",
    "the proposed privacy measure copes with adversaries whose background knowledge concerning a node @xmath21 and a subset @xmath5 of attacker nodes is the metric representation of @xmath21 with respect to @xmath5 .",

    "@xmath1-metric antidimension_. we propose a true - biased algorithm whose computational complexity and success rate can be adjusted .",
    "empirical results show that our algorithm finds @xmath1-antiresolving basis in random graphs of order at most @xmath16 with a success rate above @xmath15 .",
    "our algorithm has been also used to determine the privacy offered by two real - life social graphs against active attacks .",
    "finally , we provide theoretical results on the @xmath1-metric antidimension of graphs , such as paths , cycles , complete bipartite graphs and trees .",
    "the rest of this article is structured as follows .",
    "section  [ sec_related_work ] briefly reviews the literature on privacy - preserving publication of social network data .",
    "section  [ sec_antiresolving_sets ] presents the metric representation as a reasonable definition of the adversary s background knowledge .",
    "it also introduces the @xmath1-metric antidimension as the basis for the privacy measure @xmath0-anonymity . in section [ sect - algo ]",
    "we present a true - biased algorithm for computing the @xmath1-metric antidimension of a graph , and evaluate the proposed algorithm through experiments .",
    "preliminary results ( mathematical properties ) on the new problem ( the @xmath1-metric antidimension ) are provided in sections [ sec_metric_antidimension ] and [ section - trees ] ( the later specifically addresses the case of tree graphs ) .",
    "section  [ sec_conclusions ] draws conclusions and future work .",
    "a social graph @xmath2 is a simple graph where @xmath22 represents the set of social actors and @xmath23 their relationships .",
    "both vertices and edges could be enriched with attribute values such as weights representing trustworthiness or labels providing meaning .",
    "we consider , however , social network data in its most `` simplest '' form , _",
    "i.e. _ , a simple graph without further annotation .",
    "privacy breaches in social networks are mainly categorized in identity disclosure or link disclosure  @xcite . to perform such attacks adversaries rely on background knowledge , which is usually defined as structural knowledge such as vertex degrees  @xcite or neighborhoods  @xcite .",
    "the assumptions on the adversary s background knowledge determine the type of privacy attacks and the corresponding countermeasures .",
    "privacy - preserving methods for the publication of social graphs are normally based on the well - known concept @xmath1-anonymity  @xcite adapted to graphs .",
    "@xmath1-anonymity , initially proposed for microdata , aims at ensuring that no record in a database can be re - identified with probability higher than @xmath24 . to do so",
    ", identifying attributes should be obviously removed , and any combination of non - identifying attribute values should not be unique in the database . in practice ,",
    "not all the attributes need to be combined , because they do not belong to the adversary s knowledge .",
    "this leads to the concept of _ quasi - identifier _",
    ", that is , an attribute that can be found in external source of information and , combined with other quasi - identifiers , can uniquely identify a record in the database .",
    "even though graphs can be represented in tabular form and , thus , graph @xmath1-anonymity can be defined in terms of quasi - identifying attributes  @xcite , graph @xmath1-anonymity is typically defined in terms of structural properties of the graph rather than on attributes .",
    "for instance in  @xcite , the adversary s background knowledge is defined as a _ knowledge query _",
    "@xmath25 evaluated for a given target node of the original graph @xmath10 .",
    "the knowledge query @xmath25 allows the creation of a candidate set consisting of @xmath26 . in other words , all the nodes in the network matching the query @xmath27 are equally likely to be the target node @xmath28 .",
    "this simple concept is the basis of several passive attacks and privacy - preserving methods in the publication of social graphs  @xcite .",
    "other privacy notions based on entropy rather than on @xmath1-anonymity have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "this type of privacy measure is better suited for methods based on random addition , deletion , or switching of edges .",
    "the perturbation could be made in such a way that the number of edges or the degree of the vertices are preserved  @xcite .",
    "however , empirical results obtained in  @xcite suggest that random obfuscation poorly preserves the topological features of the network .",
    "passive attacks to social networks can be combined with active attacks .",
    "in addition to structural knowledge , in an active attack the adversary manages to control a subset of nodes ( attacker nodes ) of the original graph @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the attacker nodes aim at creating links with their victims by either identity theft or cloning of existing users profiles  @xcite .",
    "they also establish links between themselves so as to build a subgraph @xmath29 of attacker nodes with the following properties : i ) @xmath29 can be efficiently identified in @xmath10 and ii ) @xmath29 does not have a non - trivial automorphisms . once @xmath29 has been identified , the adversary is able to re - identify neighbor nodes of @xmath29  @xcite or even arbitrary nodes in the network  @xcite .    performing active attacks is not easy , given that there exist several detection mechanisms of attacker or sybil nodes in a network  @xcite .",
    "however , such defenses strongly depend on assumptions on the topological structure of the social network , which does not hold in many real - world scenarios  @xcite .",
    "actually , recent works aim at mitigating , instead of preventing , the impact of sybil attacks  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a group of users who collude in order to breach the privacy of other users in the network can be also regarded as attacker nodes .",
    "other types of active attacks exist .",
    "for instance , the maximal vertex coverage ( mvc ) attack consists in attacking a few nodes so as to delete as many edges of the network as possible . in this attack , the attacker tries to convince some users to leave the social network in order to reduce the number of residual social ties .",
    "metrics to quantify the impact of mvc attacks have been studied in  @xcite .",
    "mvc is not a privacy attack , though .",
    "while there exist several published active attacks to social graphs , there does not exist yet a rational privacy metric for evaluating the resistance of social graphs to this type of privacy attack . to overcome this problem , in this article we introduce @xmath0-anonymity ; a privacy notion based on @xmath1-anonymity and the metric representation of nodes in a graph .",
    "note that , privacy notions with the same name has been already proposed .",
    "for instance , feder and nabar proposed @xmath0-anonymity where @xmath30 represents the number of common neighbors of two nodes  @xcite .",
    "this notion was later generalized by stokes and torra in  @xcite . in our privacy notion",
    ", however , @xmath30 represents an upper bound on the @xmath1-metric antidimension of the graph .",
    "interested readers could refer to  @xcite for further reading on privacy - preserving publication of social graphs .",
    "in this section we define the metric representation of nodes with respect to a set of attacker nodes @xmath5 as the adversary s background knowledge .",
    "we also introduce the resulting privacy measure , named @xmath0-anonymity , and its related mathematical problem : the @xmath1-metric antidimension .",
    "vulnerabilities in an anonymized social graphs are better understood once the adversary s knowledge has been properly modeled .",
    "this knowledge can be acquired from public information sources and through malicious actions . in practice",
    ", the adversary could even be a close friend , which makes the publication of social network where users can not re - identify themselves a reasonable privacy goal .",
    "adversary s background information in passive attacks is typically modeled as structural knowledge on the network .",
    "this is a sort of _ global _ view that provides adversaries with the ability to partition the set of nodes into equivalence classes of structurally equivalent nodes .",
    "the strongest of those structural relations is automorphism  @xcite .",
    "two vertices @xmath21 and @xmath31 are automorphically equivalent if there exists an isomorphism from the graph to itself such that @xmath21 maps to @xmath31",
    ". other types of structural relations are based on vertex degrees , connectivity , or local neighborhood .",
    "intuitively , structurally equivalent vertices are indistinguishable with respect to the considered structural property .",
    "however , adversaries controlling attacker nodes in a network are undoubtedly more powerful .",
    "in addition to the global view , they have a _ local view _ determined by the relationship of the attacker nodes with the network . to illustrate this",
    "let us consider the graph shown in figure  [ fig : graph : path ] .",
    "with respect to the vertex degree property , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are indistinguishable .",
    "they are easily re - identifiable by either an adversary or a legitimate user owning the vertex @xmath34 and knowing its distance to @xmath32 and @xmath33 , though .",
    "a first step towards modeling such local view was given by hay et al .",
    "@xcite , who defined the concept of _ hub fingerprint queries_. a hub is a relevant node in the network with high degree and high centrality , and a hub fingerprint for a target node @xmath28 is a vector of distances from @xmath28 to hub vertices . although not explicitly mentioned in  @xcite , the largest hub fingerprint for a target node @xmath28 is indeed the _",
    "metric representation _ of @xmath28 with respect to the hub vertices .",
    "we formally define this concept as follows .",
    "[ def_vertex_representation ] let @xmath2 be a simple connected graph and @xmath8 be the length of the shortest path between the vertices @xmath21 and @xmath31 in @xmath10 . for an ordered set @xmath35 of vertices in @xmath22 and a vertex @xmath31 , we call @xmath36 the _ metric representation _ of @xmath31 with respect to @xmath5 .    similarly to hay et al . work  @xcite , we define the adversary s background knowledge about a target node @xmath21 as the metric representation of @xmath21 with respect to @xmath5 . in this article , however , we assume @xmath5 to be any subset of attacker nodes rather than hub vertices only .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the concept of metric representation is also the basis of two weel - known concepts : resolving sets and metric dimension ( cf . definition  [ def : resolving ] ) .",
    "both have been already motivated by problems related to unique recognition of an intruder position in a network  @xcite , where resolving sets were called _ locating sets_. the name `` resolving set '' is due to harary and melter @xcite , who introduced the concept in 1976 .",
    "[ def : resolving ] let @xmath2 be a simple connected graph . a set @xmath37 is said to be a _ resolving set _ for @xmath10 if any pair of vertices of @xmath10 have different metric representations with respect to @xmath5 .",

    "the parameter @xmath1 is used as a privacy threshold , whilst @xmath30 is an upper bound on the expected number of attacker nodes in the network .",

    "a fair assumption , for example , is that the number of attacker nodes is significantly lower than the total number of nodes in the network . to further explain the role of @xmath1 and @xmath30 in definition  [ def_graph_anonymity ] we provide the following example result .",

    "according to figure  [ fig : rates ] , both algorithms perform poorly for @xmath161 . however , when @xmath142 they already achieve a success rate above @xmath15 , which is further improved by the more computationally demanding versions of algorithm  [ alg_antiresolving ] and algorithm  [ alg_antiresolving_basis ] that consider @xmath143 .    the difference between figure  [ figure : set ] and figure  [ figure : basis ] suggests , as expected , that finding a @xmath1-antiresolving basis is harder than finding a @xmath1-antiresolving set .",
    "notwithstanding , algorithm  [ alg_antiresolving_basis ] performs above @xmath15 when @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "it is also worth remarking that , even though figure  [ fig : rates ] hints that the success rate of both algorithms monotonically decreases with @xmath1 , our algorithms have @xmath162 of success rate if @xmath1 is equal to the order of the graph .",
    "this is because @xmath163 and , thus , all the nodes in the graph should be contained in a @xmath1-antiresolving set according to lemma  [ theo_1 ] .    in the previous section we provided a theoretical impossibility result whereby a graph",
    "can be proven to not contain a @xmath1-antiresolving set . in figure",
    "[ fig : ratio ] , we show that such impossibility result can be achieved by random graphs ; with small probability though .",
    "it seems also that the percentage of negative results monotonically increases with @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , it is easy to prove that this percentage reaches its minimum ( @xmath164 ) and maximum ( @xmath162 ) when @xmath1 takes its minimum ( @xmath165 ) and maximum ( @xmath166 ) value , respectively .",
    "however , proving the monotonicity of the percentage of negative results with respect to @xmath1 looks challenging and cumbersome .",
    "figure  [ fig : ratio ] also shows that the increase of the success rate of both algorithms when @xmath119 grows is due to an increase on both the number of positive and negative results .",
    "this section ends with the evaluation of two real - life social graphs with respect to the proposed privacy measure .",
    "the first graph , named _ facebook graph _ in what follows , consists of @xmath167 ego - networks from facebook  @xcite .",

    "the second graph describes an online community of students at the university of california  @xcite . in total , @xmath171 students were registered in the network and @xmath172 links were created .",

    "taking into account the previously presented empirical results on synthetic data , we used for the analyses algorithm  [ alg_antiresolving_basis ] with @xmath142 as a good trade - off between performance and success rate .",
    "the results are as follows .",
    "the panzarasa graph contains a @xmath53-antiresolving basis of size @xmath53 .",
    "this means that this graph does not satisfy @xmath51-anonymity for @xmath173 unless @xmath174 , which is a meaningless scenario .",
    "similarly , the @xmath1-metric antidimension of the facebook graph is @xmath53 for @xmath175 .",
    "hence , it satisfies @xmath176-anonymity only ; the lowest privacy guarantee with respect to our privacy measure .",
    "our results show that neither the panzarasa nor the facebook graph provide privacy guarantees against active attack .",
    "this is not surprising since these graphs have not been anonymized to prevent any type of structural attack .",
    "future work thus should be oriented to anonymization methods that consider @xmath51-anonymity as a privacy goal .",
    "in the next two sections we provide some primary theoretical results on the @xmath1-metric antidimension problem .",
