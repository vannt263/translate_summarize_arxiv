    "in the minds of many scientists , the moon is a dead world .",
    "indeed , the moon shows little activity compared to many bodies of its size or larger .",
    "internal movements tend to be very low amplitude ( see nakamura et al .",
    "1981 , for example ) and the native atmosphere is typically at total atomic / molecular number density below @xmath2 @xmath3 at the lunar surface ( hodges 1975 , hoffman & hodges 1974 ) with a mass of 20 - 30 tonnes .",
    "some geological features are suggestive of recent activity ( e.g. , schultz , staid & pieters 2001 , 2006 ; c.f . ,",
    "strain & el - baz 1980 ) , but not overwhelming in number . as little as 3  gy ago",
    ", however , the moon has suffered a major fraction of its surface covered by a high - temperature , refractory basalt .",
    "cooling models predict that the moon has evolved to have a lithosphere of essentially a single crustal plate many hundreds of km thick ( e.g. , spohn 2004 & op cit . ) ; however , it is natural to wonder what evidence might exist for residual volcanic activity persisting to the present .",
    "this might be manifest in the form of volatile release to the surface through partial breaching of the crust s integrity in the form of lithospheric fracturing due to massive impacts , or stresses from tides or mascons interacting with overlying crust ( reindler & arkani - hame 2001 ) . in this paper",
    "i consider indications of rapid changes that may occur on the moon due to internal or intrinsic processes . in accompanying papers",
    "we propose how to advance our understanding of this situation beyond its current ambiguity .",
    "transient lunar phenomena ( tlps , called ltps by some authors ) are predominantly optical - wavelength effects , typically reported by observers monitoring the moon visually through a telescope ( with a few exceptions discussed below ) .",
    "their physical nature is unknown and even their reality is a point of dispute .",
    "( i discuss in  3 episodic lunar gas discharges that i do not call tlps _",
    "per se _  while some authors do  but their relation to tlps is a crucial theme of this paper . )   tlps are usually brightenings or dimming / obscurations of the lunar surface , sometimes changing color - usually reddish but occasionally blue or violet .",
    "( some early observers refer enigmatically to tlps only as lunar `` volcanoes '' . )",
    "tlps are localized , nearly always to a radius much less than 100 km , often as unresolved points ( less than an arcsecond - about 1.9 km at the earth - moon distance ) .",
    "there are classes of phenomena , however , that some authors call tlps that involve the whole moon and , while interesting , will fall outside our discussion ( some examples : spinrad 1964 , sanduleak & stocke 1965 , verani et al .",
    "i do not discuss phenomena tied to solar eclipses ( but retain a few during lunar eclipses ) , and will omit events where the particular location is unspecified , including several events involving the extension of the cusps of the crescent moon .",
    "tlps are reported on timescales from `` instantaneous '' ( probably a few tenths of a second due to small meteorite impacts ) to several hours .",
    "tlps are reported for many sites over the lunar surface , but are far from randomly distributed ; a key question is whether this is physical or a severe observer bias .",
    "even casual investigators of tlps notice something unusual associated with the region around the crater aristarchus .",
    "this includes the adjacent crater herodotus , and schrter s valley ( vallis schrteri ) flowing from `` cobra - head '' ( or `` cobra s head '' ) , which together occupy the southeastern quarter of the compact , raised aristarchus plateau of @xmath440,000 km@xmath5 within the huge ( @xmath6 km@xmath5 ) mare region oceanus procellarum , but close to the mare imbrium boundary .",
    "( vallis schrteri was once selected as the landing site for apollo 18 , later cancelled along with apollos 19 and 20 .",
    ")   aristarchus is among the brightest nearside lunar craters , sometimes _ the _ brightest , sometimes visible to the unaided eye from earth along with perhaps copernicus and tycho ( which each produce less than 5% of the tlp reports of aristarchus ) , and one of the youngest .    more than copernicus , aristarchus is distinguished by its stark contrast to the surrounding dark background ( but this is unlike other tlp - producing features on the plateau ) .",
    "once the region was intensely active , with volcanic flows and eruptions , and many sinuous rilles remain , likely old lava channels , including the most voluminous on the moon , vallis schrteri .",
    "not only is this region responsible for @xmath450% of the visual telescopic tlp reports ( but also likely receives a disproportionate fraction of the observing attention ) , undeniably objective lunar anomalies of a transient , physical nature occur in the aristarchus region , as detailed below .",
    "several experiments on apollo lunar missions , orbiting and surface , as well as on _ lunar prospector _ , were designed to detect and identify gases in the tenuous lunar atmosphere , both ions and neutral species , plus decay products from gaseous radioactive isotopes . even though some of these spent only days or weeks operating near the moon , most observed evidence of sporadic outgassing activity , including events that seem unassociated with anthropogenic effects .",
    "this paper treats the correspondence between this activity and tlps . to establish",
    "if tlp behavior is connected with the physics of the lunar environment , in paper ii we explore ways in which this might be so , and in paper iii , i explore ways in which this understanding can be increased with technologically - accessible , systematic observations .    in the next decade , numerous spacecraft and humans will visit the moon again .",
    "this offers an unprecedented opportunity to study the atmosphere of the moon , but will also introduce transients from human activity that may complicate our understanding of this gas and what it can disclose regarding the lunar interior s structure , composition and evolution .",
    "we must evaluate the current results now and expand upon them rapidly to exploit our upcoming opportunity to explore the moon in its still pristine state .",
    "tlp as observed are apparently rare events , and therefore the tlp database is largely anecdotal . furthermore ,",
    "since tlps are observed for short durations , there is rarely the opportunity to introduce possibly corroborating observations , such as photography or spectroscopy . for these reasons , primarily ,",
    "the reputation of tlps among many scientists is suspect , and also their explanation is largely unsettled .",
    "nonetheless , tlps represent a large database , cataloged by the great efforts of winfred cameron , barbara middlehurst and others , and if the reality of tlps can be evaluated they might offer a potentially interesting method to study the moon .    in the companion to this work ( paper 0 ) , the statistical structure of the tlp database",
    "is investigated in terms of the sensitivity of the results ( that is , the consistent rate at which specific lunar features produce tlp reports ) to parameters that might betray human observer bias or error .",
    "paper 0 concludes that to the extent that one can test the effects of human bias / errors , they appear important only during one historical period ( the most recent ) , and otherwise the behavior of tlp source features are impressively consistent , qualitatively .",
    "these tests imply @xmath7% of tlp reports are inconsistent and therefore suspect , but that many , quite possibly the majority , indicate a consistent phenomenon untied to the non - lunar variables involving the manner of observation .",
    "below i will review the arguments for statistical consistency from paper 0 by considering such a `` robustness test , '' but first deal with a few auxiliary issues .",
    "there are several works which have studied tlps in terms of the fraction of various kinds of events e.g. , brightenings , dimmings , obscurations , red and blue - colored events .",
    "classification and analysis of tlp categories have been discussed at length in the literature ; refer to cameron ( 1972 ) for an effective overview .",
    "of 113 reports in middlehurst ( 1977a ) involving enhanced brightness in blue and/or violet , 101 of them involve j.c .",
    "bartlett , composing most of his total of 114 reports ( between 1949 and 1966 ) , most of those ( 108 ) involving aristarchus .",
    "in contrast only 9 of 12 total non - bartlett blue / violet events occur in the same years ( during which 47% of all reports occur ) .",
    "we must correct for this somehow , either by rejecting all blue / violet events or all reports by bartlett ; i choose the latter .    a total of 71 reports in middlehurst et al .",
    "( 1968 ) include duration estimates ( which can be interpreted to better than a factor of 2 ) .",
    "of course this is not a statistical sample , but the reports indicate prolonged occurrences ; binned in @xmath8 intervals from 60s to 19000s ( with the longest event being 18000s and the shortest 60s ) the duration distribution is : 60 - 190s , 7 reports ; 191 - 600s : 9 ; 601 - 1900s , 27 , 1901 - 6000s , 23 ; more than 6000s : 5 .",
    "these effects are not so rapid as to not allow reinspection ( albeit by the same observer in most cases ) .",
    "there are four cases in middlehurst et al .",
    "( 1968 ) described as sudden , isolated flashes of light , and these are not correlated with meteor showers ( the tlps occurring on 1945 october 19 , 1955 april 24 , 1957 october 12 , and 1967 september 11 ) .",
    "none of these are well - placed with respect to known meteor showers .",
    "( april 23 is the peak of the pi puppids , but these are strong only near the perihelion of comet 26p / grigg - skjellerup , which occurred in 1952 and 1957 , not 1955 . )   suggestions for other mechanisms for short - lived tlps include piezoelectric discharge ( kolovos et al .  1988 , 1992 - which also includes an interesting recorded tlp observation ) . in paper 0 we show that evidence indicates that minimal impacts visible from earth will occur on sub - second timescales , while even the brightest and rarest impacts will be visible for only a few seconds .    even if very large impacts can produce events of sufficiently long duration , it is clear from model computation e.g. , morrison et al .  ( 1993 ) that the fresh impacts seen in _ clementine _ and other data sets can not sustain such activity .",
    "this indicates that the great majority of tlp reports can not be generated by impacts , which leaves open the possibility that their geographical distribution is not random .",
    "the spatial distribution might be expected to carry detailed information about the tlp mechanisms , assuming observer selection effects can be removed",

    ". this may be due to the greater extent of maria ( and mare boundaries : see the following ) on the western side .",
    "the primary spatial modulation of the report rate , that has been noticed previously , beyond just the frequency at specific sites is the tendency of reports to avoid the deep highlands and to some degree the mid - mare plains , but instead to congregate in the vicinity of the maria / highland interface ( cameron 1967 , 1972 , middlehurst & moore 1967 , buratti et al .",
    "even aristarchus / vallis schrteri / cobra s head / herodotus in the midst of oceanus procellarum rests on a giant block of about 40,000 km@xmath5 ( probably from a previous mare basin impact ) elevated 2 km above the mare plain , although this might easily be a special case .    how do we deal statistically with the horrendous selection effects introduced into this data set by the patterns and biases of the observers , most of whom never intended that their reports form part of a statistical database ?",
    "this is as much a historical and even a psychological question as a physical / mathematical one ; however , there are some regularities that we might exploit .",
    "first , the pattern of tlp observer behavior seems to have changed significantly in the mid-20th century , when well - publicized reports such as alter ( 1957 ) drew attention to tlps and particular locations such as alphonsus and aristarchus .",
    "many observers after that era concentrated specifically on sites such as these in an effort to maximize success in detecting a tlp . prior to this era",
    ", i see little evidence ( paper 0 ) that observers were drawn _ a priori _ nearly as much to specific sites .",
    "middlehurst ( 1977a ) has reviewed historical reports extensively and comes to a similar conclusion .",
    "indeed , many reports from previous centuries neglect to fully specify the site of their tlp .",
    "i can not fully appreciate the observing motivations of astronomers from so long ago , but there is little written indicating special sites such as aristarchus as targets of propagating popular or professional attention in terms of tlps ( paper 0 ) .",
    "aristarchus did receive wider scrutiny in 1911 when r.  wood indicated that it might contain high concentrations of sulfur , but this did not produce a spate of aristarchus tlp reports . indeed , wood discusses volcanism in the context of aristarchus ( sometimes known as `` wood s spot '' ) and seems unaware of the number of tlp reports in the vicinity ( wood 1911 ) . in paper 0 earlier works by w.h .",
    "pickering ( 1892 , 2004 ) on aristarchus and lunar activity are detailed , but these show no evidence of having inspired later tlp reports . furthermore , birt ( 1870 ) and whitley ( 1870 ) provide a historical overview ( 17871880 ) of visual observations of aristarchus ( and herodotus ) while conducting a spirited debate about the nature of features including possible changes in their appearance .",
    "they mention small , possible changes , but give them no special significance , nor mention anything that today we might refer to as a recognized tlp phenomenon ( or at least a human tendency to report tlps ) .",
    "a different statement is made by elger ( 1884 ) , who again reviews aristarchus , herodotus and the surrounding plateau .",
    "while he does not mention anything like tlps , he makes a telling statement : `` although no part of the moon s visible surface has been more frequently scrutinized by observers than the rugged and very interesting region which includes these beautiful objects , selenographers can only give an incomplete and unsatisfactory account of it ... ''    paper 0 also contains a more quantitative treatment of the extent to which observations of transients in aristarchus might be significantly causally correlated , suffice it here to say that there is little evidence of this , before 1957 .",
    "this lack of signifcant correlation can also be considered an `` integral constraint '' on the importance of observer preconception as to the existence of tlps as an important factor ( for aristarchus , at least ) in determining the observation selection function ; furthermore , they provide no evidence for a `` hysteria signal '' of false reports due to special attention .",
    "elger s statement above implies that the ratio of observing time for aristarchus and the plateau versus equal areas not near the limb is at least of order unity , and probably more .",
    "we will see on the basis of @xmath0rn alpha particle measurements from apollo and _ lunar prospector _ in sections below that this can not with any reasonable probability imply that tlps occur all over the moon at the rate reported as in aristarchus ( and hence we are not simply being fooled because human observers spend more time looking at the aristarchus plateau ) .",
    "there is a pause in the frequency in tlp reports in both the cameron ( 1978 ) and middlehurst ( 1968 ) catalogs , and indeed the break in reports 1927 - 1931 divides the middlehurst catalog at the median epoch in the catalog .",
    "i will exploit this to compare both halves of the sample and eliminate over - reporting artifacts by rejecting the higher of the two counts for a given lunar feature in the manner that one can use to remove artifacts from two exposures in a sequence of the same picture with a poorly defined non - poisson noise component .",
    "specifically , i bin the counts seen in figure 1 into 300 km square `` pixels '' and take the smaller of the two counts for each pixel from before and after 1930 , producing figure 2 . since each pixel can be labeled with the name of the feature(s ) identified by the observers in the reports that filled that pixel , i list the corrected count for each feature or group of features ( table 2 ) . within each pixel",

    "the latter is a rejection consideration in less than 10% of the cases .",
    "this resulting count from this entire procedure is likely to be much more robust against selection biases than the distribution shown in figure 1 , or for that matter similar plots shown by previous authors who did not impose an artifact rejection algorithm .",
    "i am assuming in effect that there are quantitatively different observing strategy results during these two time periods , which are capable of producing spurious peaks in the geographic distribution of reports , but do not completely neglect any area of the nearside moon , excepting geometric effects such as limb foreshortening or lunar phase selection due to evening / morning viewing times , which are independent of time when averaged over the libration period ( between one day and one sidereal month ) .",

    "alphonsus in particular involved reports ( except one ) only since the alter ( 1957 ) observations , which precipitated a great deal of amateur interest . beyond aristarchus ,",
    "plato is still a prominent feature with 15 counts , but besides these two craters only grimaldi and messier survive with more than one count ( having only two apiece ) .",
    "if the frequency of tlps at a given site varies radically on the timescale of centuries down to a few decades , features might drop from table 2 .",
    "this selection filter is meant to sacrifice completeness in this case for reliability .",
    "depending on the long - term fluctuations in tlp behavior , there may be additional , significant tlp sites than what appears in table 2 .",
    "for the sake of further discussion in this paper i assume the rates are constant on these timescales .",
    "plato is a distinct , flooded crater on the northwestern edge of mare imbrium , so is about 3.5 gy old or older .",
    "it sits near mountainous regions such as montes alps , and appears very dark in comparison , and is very different than aristarchus in visual appearance .",
    "it can be striking in its long shadows stretching across its face when near the terminator .",
    "some observer descriptions sound suspiciously like reports of this normal activity , but most do not correspond to normal appearance ( see haas 2003 ) . in 1854 - 1889",
    "there were four reports involving at least some experienced observers noting extremely bright point sources that appeared for 30 min up to 5 h ( the longest duration report considered here ) ; it is unclear if these reports might have influenced each other .",
    "there are few reports involving red sources ( 3 not during eclipse ) ; there are many reports of cloud - like appearance .    in detail , if a feature is reported in an unbiased way , one should expect the count @xmath10 in table 1 related to @xmath11 in table 2 by @xmath12 on average , for the case of taking the lowest of two values deriving from the same poisson distribution . for aristarchus",
    "@xmath13 vallis schrteri @xmath13 cobra - head @xmath13 herodotus , the total in table 1 is @xmath14 , whereas @xmath15 , so the comparison is consistent with a fraction @xmath16 of reports being real .",
    "this is 86% for plato , and essentially 100% for grimaldi and messier ( within the limits of small number statistics ) .",
    "this implies that approximately 70 events should have been detected in the aristarchus plateau before 1930 at the intensity at which the moon was observed during that interval .",
    "since this represents approximately half of the tlp reports during this time , during which most reports occurred between 1700 and 1930 , it seems consistent with approximately one tlp per two years across the sample .",
    "the rate since 1930 for the aristarchus region is about four times the report rate prior to this , and it is unclear how much of this is real increase in event coverage versus false detections",
    ". it may be simply the effect of the production of many , inexpensive telescopes .",
    "taking the pre-1930 rate just inferred as a lower bound and adjusting for the fact that the moon is only observable about 20% of the time from the places where observers were posted ( accounting for sun / earth / moon position and weather ) , it seems tlps occur at least twice yearly on average , approximately",
    ". the corresponding rate after 1930 , which might have an observing duty cycle closer to unity , but might still suffer from residual spurious reports , is about once per month .    in paper 0 ,",
    "i perform additional robustness tests largely independent of this one , requiring consistency by ( 1 ) taking the median of four comparably - sized historical subsamples ( before year 1877 , 1877 - 1930 , 1930 - 1956 , after 1956 ) , or by taking the median of just the first three subsamples , ( 2 ) taking the median over the season of year of the tlp report , before 1956 , and ( 3 ) the median over subsamples grouping the reports by geographical location of the observer , before 1956 . despite that these should be different in their sensitivity to observer bias and error",
    ", they nonetheless give similar results : alphonsus , as well as ross d and gassendi , largely disappear ; aristarchus remains as by far the strongest signal , followed by plato ( about three times weaker ) . to slight degree recent impacts tycho , kepler and copernicus become stronger signals in these other tests .",
    "even most of the weak features in table 2 remain ; eratosthenes occasionally appears at a slightly stronger level .",
    "mare crisium is the only signal to vary significantly in strength between the different robustness estimates , in some cases reaching half the strength of plato .",
    "since it is actually two `` pixels '' in diameter , i am unsure that this should even be included as a feature in this analysis . on the whole",
    ", however , the consistent behavior of the main features in the sample lends credence to the notion that this approach has some validity .",
    "we are testing whether given features are robust either in human observing behavior , or in the long - term variability of the actual physical processes producing tlps at given sites .",
    "at least i have varied the former in several significant ways and find its effects to be consistent for most features , and inconsistent primarily in those features where history casts some suspicion .",
    "figure 2 as well as figure 1 appears to retain the property that the points are clustered around the mare / highland interface . to develop the locus for this boundary is a challenge , but guided by the observation by li and mustard ( 2000 ) that the highlands and maria have distinct compositions and that this is immediately apparent in uv / visible flux ratio maps such as those available from _ clementine _ ( see also whitaker 1972 for uv / ir ) .",
    "we would like to develop a statistical test exploiting the separation between a given tlp site and the closest boundary segment .",
    "this depends on not only the length of this curvilinear boundary but also its hausdorff index ( as in a mandelbrot set ) and flux ratio threshold , somewhat arbitrarily ( see appendix i ) .",
    "i intend to explore this further , but for now a simple hand - drawn curve based on _ clementine _ maps indicates that the points in table 2 ( weighted by report count ) are about 7 times closer to the boundary than random points , which is a statistically significant result ( at the @xmath17% level ) .",
    "this tlp correlation still suffers from the objection that some observer effect might manufacture reports at the mare / highland boundary , however , even after circumvention of the fractal / threshold problem .",
    "when i remove the points in table 2 from table 1 and correlate the residuals , i get a @xmath18 greater closest boundary separation , but this is for more points and hence significant at a very high level . whatever is causing the tlp / boundary correlation appears to survive even in the points that did not pass the more robust tlp report filter , so there appears to be a residual effect of this mechanism , whatever it is , in the rejected points .",
    "a natural explanation might be that many of the less active points are real , but create a tlp sufficiently rarely so as to not repeat over decades or even centuries , in which case the total tlp rate might be doubled or more .",
    "the maria / highland boundary signifies several additional geophysical and mineralogical transitions : the change in albedo and uv / ir and uv / optical properties already mentioned  which is tied to composition ; an apparent correlation with rille structures corresponding to lava flows draining into mare basins , presumably ( whittaker 1972 ) ; and even changes in electrical conductivity properties presumably related to deep basalt concentrations and differing structure and cooling due to the ancient presence of lava ( vanyan et al .  1979 ) .",
    "the cooling of the maria and highlands were very different ( reindler & arkani - hamed 2001 ) , which might lead to a situation in which mascons that tend to underlie the maria that were supported at early times might come to strain the surrounding material as the maria cool .",
    "since the highlands are heavily fractured , while the maria are more `` annealed , '' the mare / highland boundary might also be the location where basalt - entrained gas might most easily escape .",
    "most importantly , as we shall see below , there is significant evidence for enhanced outgassing at the mare / highland interface , and this , i speculate , might be due to the release of trapped maria gas , treated in more detail in  3.3 .",
    "i deal in paper 0 with several works considering explanations of tlps as non - lunar or non - physical ( usually observer - effect ) mechanisms . to summarize here ,",
    "none of these seem to explain more than a small minority of tlp reports , although one or two issues are left as loose ends",
    ".    any scientist should be skeptical of any conclusion based solely upon the existing optical data base of tlp reports .",
    "most of them are anecdotal , not independently verified , and involve no permanently recorded signal that did not pass through the human visual cortex .",
    "many of the observers are not professional , and some are not even very experienced .",
    "our results above indicate that a significant number are of inconsistent rates , and might be spurious .",
    "the onus of the argument must burden those who would convince us that tlps are real . when it comes to locating a spurious effect that might explain the bulk of tlp reports as unrelated to the vicinity of the moon , absence of evidence is not evidence of absence .",
    "given the inability heretofore to test a reported tlp in a timely manner with sufficiently complementary measurements , we must ask if any other physical effects firmly tied to the lunar environment are correlated with tlps .",
    "a investigation by cameron ( 1967 , 1972 ) and middlehurst ( 1977a , b ) into correlations with several possible lunar parameters turn up primarily null relations e.g. , lunar anomalistic period ( time between perigees ) , and lunar age ( phase ) , and find some correlation with perigee and crossing of the earth s magnetopause and bow shock , plus a strong correlation with local sunrise which might be a selection effect based on observers attraction to this area of higher contrast .",
    "middlehurst ( 1977a , b ) also claims a statistically significant positional correlation between tlps and shallow moonquakes ( from nakamura et al .  1974 ) , which separately have been tied to @xmath19ar release ( hodges 1977 , binder 1980 ) .",
    "one transient phenomenon which occurs on a regular basis is the elevation of a tenuous dust layer at the local shadow terminator as observed by lunokhod - ii ( severny et al .  1975 ) and surveyor 7 ( gault et al .",
    "1968a , b , rennilson 1968 ) ( and perhaps detected extending to high altitudes by astronauts on apollos 10 , 17 and perhaps 8 and 15 - criswell & freeman 1975 ) , which criswell ( 1972 ) ties to electrostatic dust elevation at the terminator caused by photoelectric ejection in daylit areas creating a voltage up to 550 v within about 1 cm of a shadow s edge .",
    "few tlps are consistent with this mechanism , however . for the remainder",
    "we need to find some mechanism to create such a disturbance near the lunar surface if tlps are to be believed .",

    "this describes exactly what is observed . a simple non - parametric test comparing the distribution of corrected tlp counts versus alpha episodic activity , such as a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov test , provides a very low degree of rejection of the null hypothesis , indicating that the sample distributions could easily be identical among these features .",
    "furthermore , the fraction of the lunar surface represented by the sites listed in table 2 is very small , only about 11% even if one includes each entire `` pixel , '' and much smaller if one restricts the area to the feature alone or the region actually spanned by tlp reports for each feature . despite this , all four alpha episodes land within this area .",

    "at the outset , the alsep seismic record offers fascinating but confusing insight into the physical nature of tlps , in that it provides a third dimension and enough information for considering physical mechanisms , and appears to point to at least two .",
    "i postpone most discussion of local physical mechanisms ( such as changes in albedo during explosive outgassing and coronal discharge ) to paper ii , but will touch on possibilities here for explaining the tlp spatial distribution .",
    "why is gas leaking out of the moon , preferentially at the maria edges and around aristarchus , a recent impact on an elevated region among maria ?",
    "there are several possibilities .",
    "first and most simply , the mare / highland interface is the one place where the fractured structure of the highlands interacts stratigraphically with more structurally sound mare basalts .",
    "this leads to compositional boundaries and fractures in highlands materials acting as channels to the surface for trapped gas related to mare emplacement . in the case of aristarchus , the pervasive volcanic conduits that fed the materials that created the plateau act as channels for residual gases",
    "a second idea is that @xmath19ar might derive from high kreep minerals since buried by mare basalt , and that the quickest way for this gas to escape is via subsurface migration in cracks below the maria , reaching the surface concentrated at mare edges . in this picture",
    "outgassing is potentially driven by purely radiogenic production , not requiring recent volcanism .",
    "this idea is troubled by the complex nature of igneous highland rock , which presumably underlie the maria , that in some cases are high in kreep composition , but in many cases kreep - poor ( simon & papike 1985 ) .",
    "it is uncertain which rock underlies the maria in question .",
    "also , this picture would presumably indicate large amounts of outgassing in the highlands far from mare edges .",
    "hodges ( 1977 ) argues that @xmath19ar arises many hundreds of km deep below the surface , with the outgassed @xmath19ar rate amounting to 3 tonne / y , about 6% of the total internal radiogenic production .",
    "( this will be higher if a significant fraction is ionized , consistent with side results : vondrak et al .",
    "1974 . )",
    "runcorn ( 1974 ) proposes a model wherein episodic lava effusion can lead to the production of mare mascons in layers denser than a single basalt mass , and that cracks caused by the resulting strain of support can surround the maria and extend through the lithosphere .",
    "these can lead to moonquakes and also channels by which gas can escape perhaps to produce tlps ( friesen 1975 , runcorn 1977 ) .",
    "this is supported by the ( weak ) correlation of tlps with maximal tidal stress ( middlehurst 1977b ) .    to study this",
    "i look at the compilation of shallow moonquakes ( nakamura et al .  1979 ) from the alsep seismograph array ( concentrated on the equatorial near side ) and plot their locations ( figure 3 ) . with only 26 well - localized points",
    ", the distribution at first appears random ( excepting an overwhelming tendency for events to congregate on the near side , with the greatest angular distance away from earth being only 11@xmath24 onto the far side  to some extent just a sensitivity issue ) , visual inspection of figure 3 indicates a tendency for these to favor the maria and even their edges , as nakamura et al .",
    "point out .",
    "again , i will calculate later a mare - edge correlational significance , which depends on the threshold adopted for compositional differences maps which effectively distinguish mare and highlands , and hence has a fractal nature that needs further study in order to produce a result not affected by arbitrary criteria , but for now i take at face value nakamura et alia s statement , which appears secure at the 99.9% level based on the same mare / highland curve drawn in  2.5 .    even though the entire sample of shallow moonquake loci is only 26 events over eight years , one notes the total absence of the aristarchus plateau from the signal ; either it was quiescent during this time , or gas leaks through its cracks without being stimulated by strong moonquakes .",
    "given that this plateau contributes 61% of reports in figure 2 , the spatial distribution of shallow moonquakes differs from this at the level of @xmath52 probability of being a random result .",
    "it may be that the massive impact which occurred at aristarchus only @xmath4450 my ago has made the process of gas finding fractures to the surface easier ; the same might be said of tycho , copernicus and kepler , the most prominent , recent , nearside impacts my ( zisk et al .",
    "1977 ) and @xmath53 my ( knig et al .  1977 ) ,",
    "compared to copernicus : 900 my ( silver 1971 ) , tycho : 96 my ( knig et al .",
    "1977 , arvidson et al .  1976 ) , and kepler :",
    "@xmath54 my ( knig et al .  1977 ) and",
    "@xmath55 my ( basilevsky et al .  1977 ) .",
    "] , none of them on the mare / highland interface but nonetheless prime tlp sites that survive the robustness sieve , and with kepler being a site of detected @xmath0rn outgassing .",
    "this idea is perhaps borne out by the distribution of tlp report locations near aristarchus , which while not sampled uniformly , nonetheless seems to show a concentration centered around the aristarchus impact , rather than the whole plateau itself .",
    "( of the 40 events near aristarchus localized to within about 10 km , 11 are contained within the 1500 km@xmath5 of the crater itself , and all are within the southwesternmost @xmath56 km@xmath5 of the plateau , which totals @xmath57 km@xmath5 in area . )",
    "there are no good shallow moonquake matches with any particular sites , beyond the mare edge tendency .",
    "( none of the total of 28 moonquakes , localized or not , land closer than 1.5 d to a tlp report : on 1972 september 16/17 being the closest  not statistically significant . )   on the other hand , the rate of moonquakes is very similar to our estimate for mare / highland boundary tlps , which may not be totally a coincidence .",
    "somewhat paradoxically , deep moonquakes ( nakamura 2005 ) , which are usually thought to occur at depths ( 500 km@xmath58 km ) unassociated with mare basalt plains e.g. , bulow , johnson & bills ( 2006 ) , are evidently correlated with mare edges as well .",
    "this is even a stronger result than for shallow quakes .",
    "there are only two ( or three ) deep moonquakes near aristarchus , out of a total sample of 98 ; again the recent impacts aristarchus , tycho , copernicus and kepler are not sites of major deep moonquake activity , while they are the sites of tlp reports and @xmath0rn outgassing .",
    "the correlation between the tlp reports shown in figure 1 ( or figure 2 ) and deepmoon quakes in figure 3 is amazing , but there are limits to it : as well as fresh impacts , the correlation around to plato is diffuse at best , spread over hundreds of km , and includes shallow events .    moonquakes seem to be correlated with tlps and presumably outgassing in terms of the large - scale mare / highland boundary pattern , but not on a finer scale ( in space or time ) .",
    "the two classes of events appear to be associated , but not directly correlated in detail in a way indicating a prompt causal sequence .",
    "a correlation does not guarantee a physical relation .",
    "i will ask later whether this apparent smearing of the correlation might be due to time delay or spatial dislocation , subsurface .",
    "the presence of shallow moonquakes and outgassing events on the mare edges may be a sign of the settling of mare basalt plains , as above .",
    "this can be studied further by the examination of concentric fault or graben structures ( lucchitta & watkins 1978 ) , and is consistent with it . in this case",
    ", typical mare plate edges are settling no more than about 100 m over 3 gy , or a rate under a few tenths of a @xmath59 m per year around their circumference .",
    "is this sufficient to release the observed gas ? as a simple model for illustration here , consider that the grinding front of this mare slippage , if as long as the curve in figure 2 ( @xmath410000 km ) , will pulverize @xmath60 tonne y@xmath32 of rock for each 100 km depth of active fault , depending on the details of the slippage face . from wilson & head ( 2003 ) , a reasonable estimate for the entrained gas content",
    "might be @xmath61 by mass .",
    "this may liberate gas in large quantities ; in paper ii , i will discuss how much gas is needed to support the observational signatures discussed above , tending toward 10 - 30 tonne y@xmath32 , depending on how many and which species . the way in which this gas reaches the surface , how long it takes , and how much it spreads from its source in the interior ( as well as the total amount of gas and what fraction thereof )",
    "will be regulated in part by the nature of this grinding and how deeply it extends .",
    "of course we could also see gas leaking from elsewhere in the maria , not just along the edges , if the settling ( and impacts ) cause them to fracture ( which they almost certainly do ) .",
    "one final calculation is whether the mare - edge signal simply involves the edge , or might involve fractures throughout , as one might suspect . a glance at appendix",
    "i would indicate that the later case probably dominates for many of the datasets , although curiously perhaps not for deep moonquakes and definitely not for tlps that have passed the robustness test . a larger dataset for",
    "both tlps / outgassing and deep / shallow moonquakes will help illucidate what mechanisms are in play .",
    "what is the cause of tlp reports in major , fresh impacts tycho , kepler and copernicus ?",
    "certainly they cause extended fractures , but their fractured / breccia lens extends down only about 1/3 of the crater diameter ( hanna & phillips 2003 ) , and the fractures themselves less than the crater diameter ( ahrens et al .",
    "these barely penetrate the crust , if at all , but do perforate the mare basalt . alternatively , buratti et al .",
    "2000 hypothesize that gas may be released by avalanches down these young surfaces , or the outgassing itself may activate mass wasting .",
    "aristarchus is unique in being about 30 times more active than any one of the other three young craters ; it is also the only such crater that arguably lands on the mare / highlands boundary ( the aristarchus plateau being highland - like both in terms of both elevation and composition - although with differences in mafic concentration : mcewen et al .  1994 . )",
    "regardless of this issue , the heightened activity level overlooks the singular nature of the plateau .",
    "this region contains the largest density of sinuous rilles , and vallis schrteri is by many times the largest such rille on the moon ( zisk et al .",
    "these are capable of having filled most of the volume of oceanus procellarum ( whitford - stark & head 1980 ) .",
    "the procellarum kreep terrane ( pkt ) is a unique region consisting primarily of oceanus procellarum and mare imbrium ( jolliff et al .  1999 , haskin et al .  2000 ) , and may contain much of the thorium in the moon , despite covering only about 17% of the surface . while in the pkt maria imbrium and humorum correspond to large mascons ( like most of the large non - pkt maria : serenitatis , crisium and nectaris ) , procellarum is notably mascon - free ( see konopliv et al .",
    "procellarum does not correspond to a well - defined , localized basins , and following runcorn ( 1974 ) , is either shallow or was filled without solidifying between lava effusion episodes .",
    "it is worth noting that the south pole - aitken basin ( spa ) is antipodal to the eastern pkt .",
    "the spa center is quoted variously as 41@xmath24.5s to 60@xmath24s , and 174@xmath24.5e to 180@xmath24e ( hiesinger & head 2004 , leikin & sanovich 1985 , wood & gifford 1980 ) , whereas the pkt centroid at 29@xmath24n , 28@xmath24w is 950 km away ( depending somewhat on the background level set for the th @xmath62-ray background : lawrence et al .",
    "1998 ) ; the spa and pkt are both roughly 2500 km across .",
    "this recalls the hypothesis ( schultz & gault 1975 ) that the spa impact should produce a huge concentration of fractures on the opposite side of the moon , in the form of a radial column reaching from the deep interior to the surface ( due to spherical aberration effects in concentrating reflecting seismic waves ) .",
    "since the spa is so large but shallow ( 12 km bottom to rim ) , and shows no extreme compositional deviations from surface crust ( pieters et al .",
    "1997 , c.f .",
    "lucey et al .  1998 ) , this leads to the hypothesis that the spa impact was a low - velocity , glancing blow ( schultz 1997 ) , which can lead to an offset between the initial impact ( and resulting antipode fracture column ) and the actual center of the crater of many hundreds of km or even @xmath63 km away .",
    "there is no obvious disturbance at the apparent antipode ( close to the southern edge of mare frigoris near plato ) , whereas schultz ( 2007 ) would like to place the antipodal fracture column near the center of the pkt to explain evidence of recent outgassing ( schultz et al .",
    "2001 , 2006 ) and similar features",
    ".    we would argue that the center of the aristarchus / kreiger / prinz volcanic activity ( at about 28@xmath24n , 46@xmath24w , 470 km from the pkt centroid , away from the center of imbrium ) , thought to be the major source of the pkt effusion , is an even more likely spa antipodal feature . obviously , a large portion of the pkt originated within imbrium crater , but if the terrane is due to spa antipodal eruption , the aristarchus activity ( and to a lesser extent marius hills ) probably contributed much of the remainder .",
    "one objection to both hypotheses , however , is the unknown direction of the low - angle approach of the spa impactor .",
    "the thickest elevation of highlands material is to the north and east of spa , which would place the impact antipode to the north and west , although large amounts of spa ejecta must be found in the nearside southern highlands ( peterson et al .",
    "( if the spa impact began opposite aristarchus , ejecta would be thrown in the direction of mare orientale - presumably a later impact which may have redistributed much spa ejecta . )",
    "if the spa antipode eruption concept is valid , it seems likely to involve the pkt and thereby the volcanic activity near aristarchus .",
    "if this is the case , the outgassing seen there now may be the residual of this , connected with low - level activity plausibly involved with the deep moon .",
    "the further study of outgassing and the gas composition might offer many insights into the lunar interior and evolution .",
    "for instance , the fact that we see gas derived from heavier elements like uranium bespeaks only partial differentiation of the interior , which might be probed additionally by understanding the behavior of very light volatiles , a topic requiring much future work regarding tlps .",
    "in this paper , i study and cross - correlate various transient effects occurring on the moon : radon outgassing , moonquakes and optical transients .",
    "the latter are somewhat problematic because they are the most heterogeneously surveyed . at the same time , this tlp database is much larger , offering the possibility that we might remove the effects of observer selection bias and false reports .",
    "this is worthwhile , because lunar outgassing , whether tied to tlps or not , would be a rare event , and the combined observational survey power of human observers since the invention of the astronomical telescope would be by far the most potent way to study these events if they are optically active .",
    "while in the near future , robotic telescopes will supplant this database ( see crotts et al .",
    "2007 ) , it is fortunate that i can produce consistent signals from these data with a variety of robust sieves probing the structure of the database in various ways .    the tlp data set is frought with selection effects and almost certainly at least some false reports , for which explicit correction is problematic .",
    "nonetheless , the striking spatial correspondence between the distributions of @xmath0rn episodic release and a sample of tlps once they are culled of the more obvious selection biases and bad data is strong evidence that lunar outgassing is an important contributor to tlps , with a probability at the 99.99% level or greater . since there is little evidence in the tlp database and literature of a `` hysteria signal '' before 1956 which might be due to inexperienced or overenthusiastic observers significantly polluting the sample with false reports , the most likely systematic effect that might remain is overattention to certain features by observers not seeking tlps .",
    "however , this can not explain the geographical distribution of reports .",
    "this is because the tlps are confined to the same very small area as @xmath0rn activity ( hence they are almost certainly related ) , but tlps are also highly concentrated on aristarchus ( as may be @xmath0rn ) .",
    "if the preponderance of aristarchus reports were due to an observer selection bias only , the implied amount of outgassing in the rest of the tlp region would be at least two orders of magnitude greater than in aristarchus alone ( and more than three orders of magnitude if extended to the entire near side ) . as well as seeming increasingly implausible in terms of observer behavior",
    ", this selection bias hypothesis would violate these physical constraints ( the number of @xmath0rn episodes detected being 4 , not a few hundred or several thousand ) .",
    "at least as it applies to aristarchus , and presumably the rest of the sample , much of the geographical structure must be due to real variation in tlp rates near the lunar surface , not selection biases .",
    "the related , but independent , correlation between lower - level tlp sites and @xmath46po concentration is nearly as strong , and statistically ( although not physically ) independent , indicating long - term as well as episodic correlation .",
    "the @xmath0rn signal is almost certainly due to outgassing , because none of the known effects associated with the mare / highlands interface listed in  2.5 would enhance @xmath33u and therefore @xmath0rn ( and therefore @xmath46po ) .",
    "the radon must be transported to these regions , presumably mixed with other gas , presumably through subsurface cracks .",
    "the same applies to sites such as aristarchus .",
    "there may be other important mechanisms , but the evidence above indicates that gas leaking from the moon somehow changes the surface appearance in the optical at least for limited periods of time .",
    "these events appear to occur around aristarchus and perhaps plato , grimaldi , and recent impact craters , and may well occur at lower rates in a broad distribution of locations .",
    "tlps can be used as a probe of lunar outgassing .",
    "it appears that gas may leak out of the moon for two reasons : because of the tectonic sagging of the mare basalt , and some other mechanism that directs gas out of impact fractures but does not produce detectable moonquakes .",
    "both may be in play at the aristarchus plateau and the latter at kepler , tycho and copernicus , all recent , major impacts there and elsewhere .",
    "surprisingly , there is an amazing correlation between the locus of tlps not including massive , fresh impact craters , and the distribution of deep moon quakes .",
    "the production of gas , and perhaps how this differs between these two kinds of sites , has the potential of becoming a new way to dissect the lunar interior structure and composition .",
    "there may be a connection of tlp activity near aristarchus to the massive eruptions there that produced much of the procellarum kreep terrane .",
    "since the pkt is antipodal to the south pole - aitken basin , the fractures caused by the this giant impact on the other isde of the moon may have provided a channel for residual outgassing from the interior at aristarchus .    in the following papers",
    "i will discuss the likely implications and possible ways to enlarge our understanding of the connection between tlps and lunar outgassing . in paper ii",
    ", i will discuss reasonable , simple models that help us understand how gas might leak from the moon and how that may produce tlps . in paper iii ,",
    "i propose several simple and powerful techniques which might be exploited to learn about the internal structure , composition and evolution of the moon employing experiments involving observations from earth and from the vicinity of the moon , and how these might relate to human activity there .",
    "i would like to thank my colleagues jani radebaugh , denton ebel , caleb scharf , michael joner , daniel austin , patrick cseresnjes and alex bergier for useful discussion .",
    "also i thank yosio nakamura and the referees for their input .",

    "( you know who you are ! )",
    "as alluded to in the main text , the correlations of different samples with the edges of the maria is an example of a mandelbrot `` coast of brittain '' problem ( mandelbrot 1983 ) , and is in particular sensitive to the smoothing scale , which we will see below is a severe consideration in the case of the aristarchus plateau .",
    "he have drawn a mare / highland boundary `` by hand '' aided by _ clementine _ albedo and uv / visible flux maps , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "compared to the locus several point distributions are correlated , and the probability is calculated in two fashions as to the probability of this correlation occurring at random : 1 ) measure the mean separation @xmath64 between a given point in the sample distribution to the nearest segment of mare / highland boundary , divide this by mean separation @xmath65 for a completely uniform distribution of points distributed over the lunar surface , then raise this ratio @xmath66 ( always less than one ) to the exponent equal to the number of points @xmath67 , yielding a random probability @xmath68 .",

    "<S> transient lunar phenomena ( tlps ) have been reported for centuries , but their nature is largely unsettled , and remains controversial . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> i the database of tlp reports is subjected to a discriminating statistical filter robust against sites of spurious reports , and produces a restricted sample that may be largely reliable . </S>",
    "<S> this subset is highly correlated geographically with the catalog of outgassing events seen by the _ apollo 15 , 16 _ and _ lunar prospector _ </S>",
    "<S> alpha - particle spectrometers for episodic @xmath0rn gas release .    </S>",
    "<S> both this robust tlp sample and even the larger , unfiltered sample are highly correlated with the boundary between mare and highlands , as are both deep and shallow moonquakes , as well as @xmath1po , a long - lived product of @xmath0rn decay and a further tracer of outgassing . </S>",
    "<S> this offers a second significant correlation relating tlps and outgassing , and may tie some of this activity to sagging mare basalt plains ( perhaps mascons ) .    additionally , low - level but likely significant tlp activity is connected to recent , major impact craters ( while moonquakes are not ) , which may indicate the effects of cracks caused by the impacts , or perhaps avalanches , allowing release of gas . </S>",
    "<S> the majority of tlp ( and @xmath0rn ) activity , however , is confined to one site that produced much of the basalt in the procellarum terrane . </S>",
    "<S> since this terrane is antipodal to the huge south pole - aitken impact , it seems plausible that this tlp activity may be tied to residual outgassing from the formerly largest volcanic effusion sites from the deep lunar interior .    in paper </S>",
    "<S> ii of this series we discuss likely theoretical implications of past and present outgassing and its connection to tlps . </S>",
    "<S> paper iii presents methodologies for remote and in - situ observations of tlps and manifestations of lunar outgassing . </S>",
    "<S> these include several ground - based methods which can be implemented immediately .    with the coming exploration in the next few years by a fleet of robotic spacecraft , followed by human exploration , </S>",
    "<S> the study of tlps and outgassing is both promising and imperiled . </S>",
    "<S> we will have an unprecedented opportunity to study lunar outgassing , but will also deal with a greater burden of anthropogenic lunar gas than ever produced , probably more than the natural atmosphere itself . </S>",
    "<S> there is a pressing need to study the lunar atmosphere and its potential sources while it is still in its pristine state .    </S>",
