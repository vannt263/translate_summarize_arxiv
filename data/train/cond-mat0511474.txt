    "many studies have reported occurrence of fluctuations and noise in biological systems and the role played by the noise , always present in natural systems @xcite .",
    "the stochastic nature of living systems and the related noise - induced effects ranges from bio - informatics @xcite , population dynamics @xcite , to virus dynamics and epidemics @xcite .",
    "noise existing in biological systems is due to environmental fluctuations and it is usually taken into account as a multiplicative white noise @xcite . the white noise is usually defined as a continuous stochastic process with zero mean and correlation function @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the noise intensity . however when we reproduce this noise in discrete time with step @xmath2 for computer simulations , we consider rectangular pulses with width @xmath3 and some distribution of probabilities for their heights . in this case",
    "the randomness is in the amplitude of noise pulses .",
    "we call this noise a discrete white noise source . in this paper",
    "we will consider both continuous and discrete noise sources .",
    "starting from markovian white noise we will introduce some memory obtaining a quasi - periodical process , which is strongly nonmarkovian .    in some population dynamics models",
    ", the noise must be positive at all times and often the randomness is due to stochastic natural events , that can be represented as pulses occurring at random times .",
    "we consider therefore a white noise source as a series of positive pulses at random times .",
    "to obtain zero average , if it is necessary , we can subtract the positive mean value .    in our model",
    "the discrete white noise at @xmath4-th step can be expressed as    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the amplitude of pulses , which we set constant for simplicity , @xmath7 is a random value , distributed homogeneously in the interval @xmath8 $ ] , @xmath9 is the theta function ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 is the probability per unit time to have a pulse and @xmath12 is the probability per one step to have a pulse . to obtain a time series of noise we extract random values @xmath7 at every time step @xmath3",
    "the average distance between pulses @xmath13 , can be considered as an effective period @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 ) .",
    "the noise average is @xmath16 , and the correlation function is different from zero only during the step @xmath3 . from formal point of view",
    "this noise is therefore white .",
    "the continuous white noise is obtained in the limit @xmath17 .",
    "this noise is usually expressed as a sequence of @xmath18-shape pulses at random times @xmath19",
    "@xcite    @xmath20    where    @xmath21    with @xmath22 the initial time , and @xmath23 the random time distances between neighboring pulses .",
    "the probability distribution is @xmath24 , where @xmath13 is distributed in the interval @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "of course the effective period @xmath26 and the mean value @xmath27 are the same as for discrete noise , and here we consider them as constant parameters .",
    "we will use both continuous ( [ pulse_noise ] ) and discrete ( [ noise1 ] ) descriptions of the noise .",
    "for some biological applications should be interesting to consider a noise source with some delay @xmath28 after each pulse .",
    "the system has memory during time @xmath28 and the next pulse is forbidden during this time .",
    "this process is suitable to obtain noise sources with varying degree of randomness , ranging from white noise , as we defined it above ( @xmath29 ) , to quasi - periodical process ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "so the probability distribution of random time distances @xmath23 is    @xmath31    where @xmath13 is distributed in the interval @xmath32 $ ] , @xmath33 is the probability per unit time to have a pulse . if @xmath34 , then @xmath35 .",
    "the first moment of @xmath13 is therefore easily derived as    @xmath36    for fixed effective period @xmath37 , the probability density @xmath33 increases as memory @xmath38 increases .",
    "this probability is equal to @xmath39 , when we have periodical process in discrete time ( @xmath40 ) . for continuous time , the probability of pulse per unit time @xmath41 , when @xmath42    for the discrete process the standard deviation of the noise is the weighted sum of this quantity during delay ( which is zero ) and that after delay @xmath43 , with the related probabilities . all parameters after delay we will mark by tilde . so we obtain    @xmath44    for the variance after delay we have    @xmath45    where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are taken for the time after delay .",
    "substituting ( [ var2 ] ) into ( [ var1 ] ) and taking into account ( [ period ] ) we obtain    @xmath48    so we have an increasing @xmath49 as the memory of the system decreases .",
    "the standard deviation achieves its maximum value @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "when the memory is maximum @xmath52 , the process is not random , so @xmath53 .    for the continuous noise process it is useful to calculate the spectral density .",
    "the characteristic function for @xmath13 is the fourier transform of the probability density @xmath54    @xmath55    by using the relation between the spectral density of the process @xmath56 and the characteristic function of @xmath13 , derived in ref .",

    "the power spectrum of the noise @xmath59 is shown in fig .",
    "[ power spectrum ] , for three values of memory parameter , namely @xmath60 .",
    "we see that at @xmath61 the spectrum is a series of @xmath62-function - like pulses with harmonics at @xmath63 . for @xmath64",
    "the spectrum density is almost constant , and corresponds to white noise .",
    "for all cases , the spectrum density is quasi - periodical with distance between maxima equal to : @xmath65",
    "the pulse noise model can be useful to describe some different physical and biological systems , where random processes with delay are present",
    ". it can be useful to describe and to understand the behavior of an epidemiological infection inside a population with a big number of individuals .",
    "in particular the number of contacts between ill and healthy people can be modelled as our noise with memory , where the delay describes the incubation period of the illness .",
    "so we can compare development of illnesses with different incubation periods .",
    "another possible application is the neuronal response to an electrochemical pulse .",
    "in fact the response time of a neuron , activated by a pulse , can depend on temperature and other parameters .",
    "moreover our pulse noise model allows to regulate the periodicity , and this should play an important role in the neural network field .",
    "the pulse noise source can also represent an alternative way to describe population dynamics of interacting species , previously modelled using stochastic resonance phenomenon @xcite .",
    "this should be very useful when a periodicity , connected with environmental parameters , is present .",
    "we start to analyze the role of the noise with memory considering a simple system described by the equation    @xmath66    where @xmath59 is the the noise with memory , @xmath67 is a negative constant , and @xmath68 can be a species density in population dynamics or the number of infected people in epidemics .",

    "an instability occurs and the illness exhibits a divergent behavior . by setting constant the value of the average period @xmath73 , time series of the infection density are obtained for different values of the delay @xmath38 , which represents the time before a new pulse can occur .",

    "[ time_series_2 ] we show the same quantities @xmath59 and @xmath68 , for the same parameter setting with @xmath78 .    in both figures an exponential behavior of @xmath68 appears with fluctuations more pronounced , when the noise source is white ( @xmath79 ) ( see figs .  [ time_series_1]a and [ time_series_2]a ) .",
    "for correlated noise we have a quasi - periodical process . the exponential behavior is decreasing ( see fig .  [",
    "time_series_1]b ) or increasing ( see fig .",
    "[ time_series_2]b ) depending on the value of parameter @xmath70 with respect to the critical value @xmath71 .",
    "we observe clearly that the noise memory affects directly the fluctuations of the number of infected people @xmath68 .",
    "using noise with zero memory we find that the critical value is @xmath80 .",
    "the noise memory also affects the exact value of @xmath71 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath70 is near the critical value with zero memory , the time behavior of the average number of infected people changes from increasing to decreasing exponential behavior , depending on the value of the noise memory . in fig .",
    "[ time_series_3 ] we report the time behavior of the average ensemble @xmath81 for different values of noise parameters @xmath70 and @xmath38 .",

    "we see that for @xmath87 ( critical value for white noise with zero memory ) , by increasing the noise memory from zero to @xmath88 , an instability - stability transition occurs . the average number of infected people changes from increasing ( ( a ) in fig .  [ time_series_3 ] ) to decreasing ( ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ time_series_3 ] ) exponential behavior .",
    "the noise with memory described above is a very useful tool for modelling quasi - periodical processes in nature .",
    "the parameter of periodicity allows to distinguish deterministic and random processes , and to adjust model to a real process accordingly .",
    "when this noise is included into the equation as a multiplicative noise , we can see qualitatively different behavior of the system in dependence on the noise amplitude and the periodicity parameter of the noise source .",
    "the role of the noise memory is to induce an enhancement of fluctuations of the number of infected people @xmath68 and to shift the critical value . when the noise parameter @xmath70 is near the critical value with zero memory , a stability - instability transition occurs . for epidemic dynamics",
    "we find that , for pulse amplitude parameter less than the critical value ( @xmath89 ) , we obtain quick recovering .",
    "moreover we find that the role of the noise memory , that is the incubation period , is to reduce the amplitude of the fluctuations of the infected people .",
    "this causes a more regular time behavior of the illness .",
    "finally concerning population dynamics of some species , this noise can represent situations in which the species density growth is a quick process , and the decreasing process is continuous in time .",
    "the delay @xmath38 should represent the time taken by the individuals of the species to become adult .",
    "so we could estimate the dependence of population dynamics on this parameter , with all other ones fixed .",
