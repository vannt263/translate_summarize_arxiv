    "the origin of mass is one of the fundamental and fascinating subjects in physics .",
    "about 99% of mass of matter in the world originates from the strong interaction , which provides the large constituent quark mass @xmath11 .",
    "such a dynamical fermion - mass generation in the strong interaction can be interpreted as spontaneous chiral - symmetry breaking ( @xmath12sb).@xcite    in the strong interaction , however , there is other type of dynamical mass generation than @xmath12sb .",
    "for instance , gluons , which are massless in perturbation qcd , seem to have a large effective mass as @xmath13,@xcite due to non - perturbative effects .",
    "actually , glueballs , which are ideally composed only by gluons , have a large mass , e.g. , about @xmath14.@xcite the same holds for charm quarks .",
    "whereas the current mass of charm quarks is about 1.2gev at the renormalization point @xmath15 = 1gev , the constituent charm - quark mass in the quark model is set to be about 1.6gev .",
    "the about 400mev difference between the current and the constituent charm - quark masses could be explained by dynamical mass generation without @xmath12sb , since there is no chiral symmetry for such heavy quarks .",
    "these examples imply mass generation without @xmath12sb in the strong interaction .",
    "we therefore conjecture that large dynamical mass generation generally occurs even without @xmath12sb in the strong - interaction world , i.e. , _ all colored particles have a large effective mass generated by dressed gluon effects._@xcite in this study , we investigate the system of colored scalar particles , which do not have chiral symmetry .",
