    "this intrinsic josephson effect can be seen in the multi - branch structure of the @xmath2-@xmath3 characteristic , each branch corresponding to a well - defined number of junctions in the resistive state.@xcite the intrinsic josephson effect is observed also in the behaviour of the material in external magnetic fields and under microwave irradiation.@xcite    recently subgap structures in the @xmath2-@xmath3-characteristic have been discovered as intrinsic properties of the material,@xcite which could be explained by the coupling between the intrinsic josephson oscillations and phonons.@xcite this interaction is mediated by the oscillating electric field in the josephson junction , which excites vibrations of charged ions in the material . in our previous investigations @xcite",
    "we used a simple model of a system of damped harmonic oscillators in order to describe the dynamics of oscillating ions in the barrier .",
    "we were able to derive an analytic expression for the dc - current density @xmath8 as function of the dc - voltage @xmath3 for one resistive junction @xmath9 where the voltage @xmath3 is related to the josephson oscillation frequency @xmath10 by @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the dielectric function of the oscillating ions . from this result",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath2-@xmath3-curve has a maximum at the frequency ( voltage ) where the real part @xmath13 of the phonon - dielectric function vanishes , which corresponds to a longitudinal eigenfrequency of the phonon system .    with appropriate values for the josephson plasma freqency @xmath14 , the quasiparticle conductivity @xmath15 , the critical current denstiy @xmath16 , and the frequencies , dampings and oscillator strengths of phonons in the dielectric function we were able to fit the experimental results for the sub - gap structures in the @xmath2-@xmath3-curves perfectly .",
    "in addition to this , the identification of the maxima of the structure with phonon frequencies provides a natural explanation , why the position of the resonances is completely independent of temperature , magnetic field and the geometry of the probe .",
    "the voltage positions of these resonances can also be related to structures in optical experiments,@xcite in particular to the reflectivity for oblique incidence@xcite .    despite the clear evidence of the effect a general theory for the coupling between josephson oscillations and phonons is still missing and",
    "shall be presented in the following . in particular , in refs .",
    "the phonon frequencies and the oscillator strengths in the dielectric function were not specified .",
    "the clarification of this point and the extension to a general lattice dynamical model including acoustical and optical branches will be one of the main topics of the following investigation .",
    "another topic concerns the coupling of josephson oscillations in different resistive junctions .",
    "we will show how phonons lead to a coupling of the phases of josephson oscillations in different resistive junctions .",
    "this will be discussed in detail for two resistive junctions and general results will be given for large stacks of resistive junctions .",
    "a phase - locking in a stack of josephson junctions is important for applications of such systems for high - frequency mixers and detectors .",
    "the excitation of phonons by josephson oscillations in conventional single josephson junctions has been observed already a long time ago.@xcite also in the @xmath2-@xmath3 curves of break - junctions of cuprate - superconductors @xcite structures due to phonons might have been identified .",
    "the physical mechanism described here can also be applied to these cases but our formalism is particularly suited to treat stacks of josephson junctions with phonons in the frequency range between the josephson plasma frequency and the gap - frequency .",
    "it is not our intention to explain the details of the @xmath2-@xmath3-characteristic of tbcco and bscco by a realistic lattice dynamical calculation .",
    "this is impossible at the moment for the complicated anisotropic superconductors with variable doping showing this effect .",
    "furthermore this would require a detailed theory of superconductivity and the josephson effect in two- and three - layer systems including information about the superconducting bands , charge distribution , and charge susceptibility between the layers and inside the cuo@xmath4 planes which is not available yet .",
    "therefore we discuss a simple model system with superconducting mono - layers where the conduction electron charge is distributed homogeneously along the layers , and a lattice dynamical model with only two phonon bands showing already the basic features of a full theory which will be expected also for realistic systems .",
    "we start the discussion with a definition of our model and a short derivation of the basic josephson equations for a stack of josephson junctions .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath17 superconducting layers separated by insulating barrier material of thickness @xmath18 forming a stack of josephson junctions .",
    "we treat the superconducting layers as homogeneous metal sheets with a uniform electron distribution along the layers . in this paper",
    "we treat only the case of a uniform tunneling current with a constant bias - current and neglect magnetic field effects due to the current flow . in this case",
    "all quantities are constant along the layers .",
    "such an approximation is reasonable for a stack of junctions which is short with respect to the josephson penetration length but long enough to neglect finite size effects in the ionic polarisation .",
    "the tunneling current density @xmath19 from layer @xmath20 to @xmath21 creates ( two - dimensional ) charge density fluctuations @xmath22 on the layers related by the continuity equation @xmath23 these charge fluctuations create electric fields @xmath24 ( in the c - direction ) in the barrier between layer @xmath20 and @xmath21 which are constant inside each barrier and are related to the charge fluctuations by the maxwell equation : @xmath25 or @xmath26    assuming that the current density @xmath19 for the first and last barrier is fixed by the bias current density @xmath27 , then with help of eqs .",
    "( [ cont],[maxwell1 ] ) the tunneling current density @xmath19 in all the other junctions is related to the bias current density @xmath27 by @xmath28 the last term is the displacement current density related to the charge fluctuations on the layers . in the following",
    "we denote this term by @xmath29 in order to relate the present results to the usual notation of the resistively shunted josephson junction ( rsj ) model , however , one should keep in mind the microscopic origin of this term .    in the following we approximate the tunneling current by a superposition of a josephson supercurrent density and a quasiparticle current density .",
    "then we have for each junction : @xmath30 the josephson current density @xmath31 depends on the gauge invariant phase difference @xmath32 between layers @xmath20 and @xmath21 at positions @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "it is related to the average total electric field in the barrier @xmath35 by the second josephson equation @xmath36 here small corrections to eq .",
    "( [ 2jos ] ) for layered superconductors which are discussed in refs .   are neglected . for the quasi - particle current density we will use in the following an ohmic form @xmath37 with a constant conductivity @xmath15 .",
    "the generalisation to more realistic forms @xcite is straightforward .",
    "the crucial point where the phonons come into play is the relation between the field @xmath38 , which is created by the charge fluctuations on the superconducting layers alone , and the average electric field eq .  ( [ totale ] ) @xmath39 which contains also the averaged field @xmath40 created by the ionic displacements in the barrier .",
    "this will be discussed in detail below .    before we do this",
    "let us summarize the most important parameters which characterize the josephson system : the first one is the ( bare ) josephson plasma frequency @xmath14 defined by @xmath41 the second one is the so - called characteristic frequency defined by @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the voltage where the quasiparticle current density equals the value @xmath16 .",
    "it is of the order of the superconducting energy gap and is a measure of the dissipative properties of the junction . in our simple model with a constant conductivity",
    "we have @xmath44 .",
    "the ratio @xmath45 is the mccumber parameter , which is @xmath46 for the strongly anisotropic cuprate - superconductors .",
    "moreover , for these materials there exist phonons with frequencies in the range @xmath47 .    typically the time - dependence of the phase difference @xmath48 can be written in the so - called resistive state as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the time - average of the phase velocity which is non - zero for a junction in the resistive state .",
    "it determines the dc - voltage @xmath51 across the junction . in the asymptotically stable state and for large values of the mccumber parameter",
    "@xmath52 the oscillating part @xmath53 is small and oscillates with the frequency @xmath10 .",
    "now let us turn to the discussion of lattice vibrations .",
    "quite generally the lattice displacement of an ion of type @xmath54 with mass @xmath55 , charge @xmath56 in unit cell @xmath57 is determined by the following equation of motion @xmath58 here @xmath59 is the local driving field at the equilibrium position @xmath60 of the ion generated by the charge fluctuations @xmath61 on the superconducting layers . note that the vibrating ions may be both in the barrier material and on the superconducting layers .",
    "the superconducting electrons are assumed to move together with the ions of the layers .    while the rsj - equations for the phases are highly non - linear , the relations between lattice displacements and electric fields are linear , consequently we may analyse the response for each frequency @xmath10 separately . with a harmonic ansatz of the form",
    "@xmath62 we obtain for the amplitude @xmath63 here @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the dynamical matrix @xmath66 defined by @xmath67 the force - constant matrix contains the quantum - mechanical short - range interactions but also the short - range and long - range coulomb interactions ( the latter being of the form @xmath68 ) between the ions , but not the fields set - up by the conduction electrons on the layers .",
    "the eigenfrequencies @xmath69 are therefore by construction the _ bare _ phonon frequencies in the absence of the conduction electron charge fluctuations @xmath61 .",
    "they include possible renormalisation by intra - atomic electronic polarisation .    for the further discussion it is convenient to label the lattice dynamical unit cells by @xmath70 with @xmath71 denoting the superconducting layer",
    "in which the lattice cell is contained ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . then the z - component of the position vector @xmath72 for @xmath73 does not depend on @xmath74 and we may write @xmath75 .",
    "furthermore the origin of the unit - cell may be chosen on the superconducting layer , so that @xmath76 .    in our model for the superconductivity in the layers we have to assume that the mobile electronic charge is spread out uniformly along the layers , because a microscopic theory connecting the superconducting bands and the atomic sites in the cuo@xmath4-layers is still missing .",
    "therefore the field @xmath77 does not depend on the position @xmath78 along the layer and has only a z - component . in eq .",
    "( [ displacement ] ) only modes with @xmath79 appear and we may write for the displacement amplitude in z - direction of an ion of type @xmath54 in barrier @xmath20 : @xmath80    now let us specify the driving field @xmath81 for the ions in more detail : summing up the electric fields created by the charge fluctuations on the different layers we find : @xmath82 note that for ions _ inside _ the barrier the driving field does not depend on the position @xmath83 of the ion and is equal to the constant field @xmath84 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ maxwell2 ] ) : @xmath85    in order to find a relation between the lattice displacements and the driving field we introduce the fourier transformation @xmath86 then @xmath87 with the @xmath88-dependent effective charge @xmath89 and consequently @xmath90 thereby the vanishing of @xmath91 for @xmath92 and for ions on the layers reflects the fact that for alternating electric fields in the barriers no net force is acting on the superconducting layers .    next we want to relate the driving field to the average total electric field @xmath93 in the barrier because this field is connected with the phase difference @xmath94 by the second josephson - equation ( [ 2jos ] ) .",
    "the microscopic total electric field @xmath95 is the sum of the fields set - up by both the charge - fluctuations and the displaced ionic charges : @xmath96 .",
    "as @xmath97 is assumed to be constant inside the barrier and independent of x we may replace the other two fields also by their averages across the barrier and over one unit cell along the layer .",
    "for the averaged fields we have then the relation : @xmath98    the field @xmath40 in the barrier can be calculated from the difference of the scalar potentials on layers @xmath20 and @xmath21 produced by the ionic displacements averaged over the area of one unit - cell as @xmath99 here @xmath100 is the volume of one unit cell .",
    "the factor @xmath101 results from the fact that displacements of ions ( with @xmath102 ) on a layer do not contribute to the potential on the same layer .",
    "note that this field for @xmath79 does not depend on the ionic displacements in other barriers and is closely related to the ionic polarisation in the same barrier . defining a generalised polarisation by @xmath103 we may write for the displacement in the barrier @xmath104 which has the usual form as in the macroscopic maxwell theory .",
    "going over to a fourier transformation the relation @xmath105 between the polarisation and the driving field is obtained with @xmath106 and the oscillator strength @xmath107 the special combination of phase factors contained in @xmath108 eq .",
    "( [ zt ] ) are a consequence of the different contribution of ions on and between the superconducting layers to the electric field in the barrier .",
    "using @xmath109 we can solve for @xmath110 : @xmath111 the relation @xmath112 defines an effective longitudinal dielectric function @xmath113 this function has zeros at the eigenfrequencies @xmath114 of the dynamical matrix . due to the form of the oscillator strengths eq .",
    "( [ osc ] ) only modes with polarization in the c - direction contribute . as the electric field @xmath93 is constant along the layers we have @xmath115 and only longitudinal modes in the c - direction couple , therefore the zeros of @xmath116 are exactly at the longitudinal eigenfrequencies of the dynamical matrix .    in the case of a single dispersionless phonon - mode with frequency @xmath117 the function @xmath118 can be directly compared with the dielectric function used in ref .  .",
    "in fact , in this case @xmath118 can be written as @xmath119    the form of the longitudinal dielectric function @xmath120 eq .",
    "( [ ephon ] ) , which we have introduced here , is different from the transverse dielectric function @xmath121 in both functions different eigenfrequencies and oscillator strengths enter , however in the limit @xmath122 , which is only relevant in optical experiments , the values of both functions are equal .",
    "finally a comparison of our theory with theoretical investigations in ref .",
    "are in order . in principle",
    "there are two different electron - phonon coupling mechanisms , which may couple josephson oscillations and phonons : 1 .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction between the ionic charges and the charges of conduction electrons , 2 .",
    "the dependence of the tunneling matrix element on lattice displacements .",
    "the first mechanism is considered in our work , the second in ref .  .",
    "both mechanisms require a different theoretical treatment ( on a diagrammatical basis the two mechanisms would correspond to different diagrams ) .",
    "it has been argued in ref .",
    "that in the layered cuprate superconductors the charges of the ions in the insulating barrier between superconducting layers are unscreened and therefore have a strong interaction with conduction electrons in the cuo@xmath4-layers .",
    "we therefore considered this mechanism for our treatment of the coupling between josephson oscillations and phonons .",
    "though we did not write down a hamiltonian for the interacting system our method nevertheless is a full microscopic theory which treats the electron - phonon interaction on a random - phase - type level by describing the interaction with the help of internal fields .",
    "this approximation is sufficient as long as we do not want to consider the electron - phonon interaction inside the superconducting layers and treat exchange effects between different superconducting layers .",
    "according to the rsj - like model derived in eq .",
    "( [ rsj0 ] ) the current density in junction @xmath20 is @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the electric field in junction @xmath20 set - up by the charge fluctuations of conduction electrons . as pointed out in the previous section this field",

    "( [ pol ] ) as @xmath125 .",
    "the polarisation has to be calculated self - consistently from the ionic displacements and depends linearly on the electric field .",
    "let us discuss first the case of one resistive junction at @xmath126 in the middle of a large stack while all other junctions @xmath127 are in the superconducting state .",
    "then as mentioned previously all the oscillations are governed by one frequency @xmath10 , and we can write for the phase for @xmath126 : @xmath128 while for @xmath127 we have @xmath129 in the stationary state @xmath130 oscillates with the same frequency @xmath10 , @xmath131 higher harmonics can be neglected for @xmath46 . in this limit the fluctuations @xmath130 are small and we may use the expansion @xmath132 while for @xmath133 we have @xmath134    the bias current density @xmath27 on the l.h.s . of the rsj - equations eq .",
    "( [ rsj1 ] ) is time - independent and equal for all junctions , while the quantities on the r.h.s have both time - independent and oscillating components .",
    "let us discuss the equations for the non - resistive junctions ( @xmath127 ) first . here",
    "the dc - component is : @xmath135 this fixes the constant part of the phases in the non - resistive junctions and relates it to the bias current .    for the oscillating part of eq .",
    "( [ rsj1 ] ) one obtains : @xmath136 or @xmath137 with the reduced josephson plasma frequency @xmath138    now we discuss the resistive junction at @xmath126 . keeping only the lowest harmonic we find @xmath139 the dc - component of the rsj - equation eq .",

    "the @xmath2-@xmath3-curve switches back to the superconducing state of the junction .",
    "another important effect of the coupling between josephson oscillations and phonons is the synchronisation ( phase - locking ) of josephson oscillations in different resistive junctions , which would be absent without phonons in short junctions , which are homogeneous parallel to the layers .",
    "we want to illustrate this for the case of two resistive junctions coupled by one narrow optical phonon branch .",
    "the second branch of the @xmath2-@xmath3-curve which corresponds to two resisitve junctions has a rather complex structure already for one phonon band .",
    "this is shown schematically in fig .",
    "if we denote the two dynamical states of the first branch by @xmath213 and @xmath214 , then on the second branch with two resistive junctions either both junctions are in state @xmath213 ( label @xmath215 ) , both junctions are in state @xmath214 ( label @xmath216 ) or one junction is in state @xmath213 while the other junction is in state @xmath214 ( label @xmath217 ) .",
    "note that in the latter case the oscillation frequencies of the two junctions are different .",
    "in the case of well separated resistive junctions the voltages of a structure for a given bias current are determined by @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 .",

    "note that this formula applies only for the states @xmath215 and @xmath216 , because in the derivation we have assumed that the two junctions oscillate with the same frequency .",
    "a similar formula can also be derived for the state @xmath217 . in that case",
    "the phases are meaningless because the two junctions oscillate with different frequencies and are essentially decoupled .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we show examples calculated for a narrow optical band with @xmath223 and the light ion oscillating in the barrier . here",
    "the different analytical solutions are shown together with numerical results for neighboring resistive junctions , @xmath224 ( a ) , and two resistive junctions separated by 1 or 2 superconducting junctions , @xmath225 ( b ) , @xmath226 ( c ) .",
    "it is plausible that in the case of neighboring resistive junctions out - of - phase josephson oscillations ( @xmath227 ) favor a coupling to phonons at the edge @xmath228 of the brillouin zone , while the coupling of in - phase oscillations ( @xmath229 ) is strongest for zone - center phonons at @xmath197 .",

    "the numerical results follow the in - phase solution . fig .",
    "[ fig7]c shows results for @xmath234 .",
    "the results obtained for two resistive junctions show that the peak position in the @xmath2-@xmath3-curve depends only slightly on the distance between the resistive junctions .",
    "more important is the fact that phonons are able to synchronise the phases of josephson oscillations in different resistive junctions .",
    "this is important for the use of such systems in high - frequency applications .",
    "we have checked this numerically for the case of a block of many resistive junctions . for frequencies @xmath10 close to a phonon eigenfrequency @xmath231 at the edge of the brioullin zone",
    "the josephson field oscillations in neighboring junctions differ by a value close to @xmath235 . for frequencies close to @xmath236 near the @xmath237-point the josephson oscillations are nearly in phase .",
    "these phase - locked dynamical states are reached from arbitrary initial conditions for the phases .",
    "there is also a synchronisation of josephson oscillations for frequencies far away from phonon resonances .",
    "we did not yet investigate the stability of these states systematically but we expect these to be less stable than at frequencies close to a phonon resonance .",
    "recently the explanation of the subgap resonances in refs .   with the phonon coupling mechanism presented here could be well confirmed by raman measurements on the same samples @xcite and infrared reflectivity experiments with grazing incidence,@xcite where the latter allows to determine both longitudinal and transverse modes ( see table [ phonon_tab ] ) .",
    "small deviations of the order of @xmath238 may be attributed to the fact that in optical experiments and in the intrinsic josephson effect different averages over @xmath239 of the dielectric functions are relevant .",
    "note that in our theory modes which are raman active at @xmath197 may couple to intrinsic josephson oscillations also for @xmath240 .",
    "earlier experimental data,@xcite which are obtained from polycrystalline samples , show the same qualitative behaviour , but differ in detail .    with the help of rigid - ion @xcite and shell - model calculations @xcite some of the more pronounced structures",
    "can be connected with certain elongation patterns of the ions in the unit cell .",
    "for example , the peak in the @xmath2-@xmath3-curve at 4.64 thz in tl@xmath4ba@xmath4ca@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath241 seems to be due to a ( cu , ba)-mode .",
    "the qualitative features of the subgap resonances have already been explained with the help of the phonon interpretation in ref .",
    ": the position of the resonance is independent on temperature , magnetic field and the geometry of the probe , while the intensity of the structure varies @xmath242 with the critical current density @xmath243 .",
    "also the behaviour of the position and intensity of the structures in external pressure are in agreement with the phonon explanation and formula ( [ iv - curve ] ) .",
    "one of the main qualitative features of the general theory with dispersive phonon bands , which goes beyond the local oscillator model used in refs .  , is the possibility to describe resonances at van - hove singularities , which appear e.g. at the upper band edge of the acoustical phonon band .",
    "this might be an explanation for a resonance seen in ref .   at @xmath244 mv ( @xmath245 ) in the @xmath2-@xmath3-characteristic of tl@xmath4ba@xmath4ca@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath241",
    ", because the same frequency is expected by lattice dynamical calculations @xcite for the upper edge of the acoustical band , and there are no optical phonon bands in this low frequency range .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows a fit of a @xmath2-@xmath3-curve calculated with the two - atomic chain model ( and some additional damping ) to the experimental results from ref . .",
    "similarily in bscco the upper edge of the longitudinal acoustical phonon band , which has been detected in inelastic neutron scattering at @xmath246 mev @xcite , might correspond to a less pronounced phonon resonance in the intrinsic josephson effect at @xmath247 mv ( @xmath248 2.38 thz ) , which seems to be invisible in optical experiments . nevertheless at the present time this interpretation is not yet fully conclusive , as the instrumental resolution of @xmath249 mev in the neutron scattering experiment is still rather large compared with the accuracy in the measurement of the @xmath2-@xmath3-curve .",
    "also the effect of the two van - hove singularities at the optical band edges on the @xmath2-@xmath3-curve as discussed above might have been seen in the satellite structures at 5.17 thz ( 10.7 mv ) and 5.6 ( 11.6 mv ) in the @xmath2-@xmath3-curve of bscco @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is further supported by the theoretical prediction of the bandwidth @xmath250 and the fact that the assignment of no other phonon mode is plausible .",

    "2 . in the case of several resistive junctions , where several analytical solutions are obtained , the numerical result follows only one of the analytical solutions .",
    "the stability of the different analytical solutions is currently investigated .",
    "it seems to be that the solution which gives a minimum for the interaction energy between polarisation and the electric field generated by the josephson oscillations at a given frequency is most stable .",
    "the phonons thus serve to synchronise the josephson oscillations in different resistive layers , which is important for the application of such systems as high - frequency devices .    in this paper",
    "we have considered only the case of a current distribution in the c - direction which is homogeneous along the layers .",
    "we neglected all magnetic field effects assuming that all quantities are uniform along the layers . for real systems",
    "this is an artificial approximation , because the current induced magnetic field can never be avoided completely .",
    "nevertheless , we argue that this is a valid approximation for the intrinsic josephson systems forming a mesa structure of about fifty layers with a width of several @xmath256 and a thickness which is much smaller .",
    "such a junction is still short with respect to the length @xmath257 describing the variation of the phase - difference along the layers ( in order to avoid completely the spontaneous formation of vortices , which have a smaller diameter , the mesa width should not exceed 1 - 2 @xmath256 ) .",
    "therefore the treatment of the superconducting layers as metal sheets with a uniform charge distribution , the creation of uniform polarisation fields and the neglect of @xmath258 in the calculation of the longitudinal dielectric function is justified for the systems investigated .",
    "this will be different in the case of longer junctions and strong external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "in particular the flow of vortices and their interaction with phonons has to be investigated in this case @xcite .",
