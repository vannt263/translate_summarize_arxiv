    "in statistical physics , self - duality in the sense of kramers and wannier maps the high temperature regime of a given model with its low temperature regime . in two dimensions ,",
    "examples of self - dual theories are provided by the 2 ( ising),3 and 4 states potts , the ashkin teller , and the clock models .",
    "all of them can be represented in terms of an electromagnetic coulomb gas @xcite , allowing to understand this self - duality as an exchange of the electric and magnetic components of the charges of the equivalent coulomb gas @xcite .",
    "this self - duality allows to locate the transition point , whose study requires however a full renormalization group study , either directly on the coulomb gas formulation @xcite or on the associated sine - gordon theory @xcite .",
    "more than fifteen years ago , cardy uncovered a generalization of this simple duality by adding a topological coupling between magnetic and electric charges of a two flavors coulomb gas @xcite .",
    "motivated by the study of oblique confinement in four dimensional @xmath1 lattice gauge theory with a topological @xmath2 term , formulated a coulomb gas where the presence of the @xmath2 term considerably enlarge the usual kramers wannier duality @xmath3 to the full modular group @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this @xmath2 coupling was later extended to higher dimensions in @xcite . by analogy with",
    "the work of kramers and wannier , derived the location of the numerous transition points in the presence of this topological coupling , as the invariant points of the modular group .",
    "the purpose of this article is to explicitly study using the renormalization group the scaling behaviour of an extension of the cardy - rabinovici model . besides the critical behaviour associated with the transition points identified by cardy , this renormalization study allows to find the scaling flow of the model : the fixed points defining different phases are defined and related to the transitions points .",
    "we thus find a condition that two different phases must fullfill to be related by a transition .",
    "this is , to our knowledge , the first explicit renormalization of a two dimensional modular invariant model .    besides the applications of this extended coulomb gas to the previously cited statistical models in two dimensions and to fermion models in 1 + 1 dimension via its sine - gordon representation ,",
    "such two dimensional modular invariant theories are of interest for the study of the global phase diagram of the quantum hall effect .",
    "this effect correspond to the quantization of the transverse conductivity @xmath5 of a two dimensional gas of electrons in a strong transverse magnetic field , and it is now well understood in terms of the microscopic laughlin waves functions @xcite .",
    "the problem of the nature of the transitions between the different quantum hall fluids is of particular interest and remain unsolved .",
    "in particular the notion of superuniversality was proposed to explain the similar behaviour of all the transitions in the global phase diagram of the quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "such a superuniversality can be deduced from a duality of the underlying model , relating all the transition points with each other .",
    "indeed the similarity between the phase diagram of @xcite and the expected renormalization flow diagram in the two parameters scaling model of the quantum hall effect was noticed @xcite before this proposal . later on related more precisely the properties of this phase diagram with the presence of a @xmath6 symmetry , in the framework of a two parameters @xmath7 scaling theory .    on the other hand ,",
    "the experiments of @xcite on the transition between the @xmath8 and the hall insulator have shown a reflection relation between the nonlinear current density and electric field on both side of the transition . within the effective description of the quantum hall effect ,",
    "this reflection was interpreted as a duality which exchanges the electric and magnetic component of the low lying excitations @xcite .",
    "motivated by these experimental results , several authors focused on modular invariant models @xcite .",
    "even though no derivation of a microscopic modular invariant model exists , these studies focused on the general constraint from the modular symmetry on the phase diagram and expressions for the conductivity at the transitions @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of the modular invariant coulomb gas we study in this paper is expected to mimic the one of the quantum hall effect . as an explicit renormalization of a modular invariant model in two dimension",
    ", we expect this study to be helpfull for the description of the critical behaviour of the quantum hall transitions .    in another context",
    ", it is interesting to notice that modular invariant coulomb gas also appeared in the work of on the dissipative motion of a charged particle in two dimension in a transversed magnetic field and a periodic electric potential . using a mapping to a one dimensional version of the model of @xcite",
    ", these authors found a phase diagram as a function of the dissipation strength and the magnetic field which resembles the diagram obtained from our renormalization study .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in the section [ part : sg ] we define the model both in its sine - gordon version and as a lattice villain model with topological @xmath2 term .",

    "the purpose of this letter is thus to study explicitly the behaviour of the modular invariant coulomb gas ( [ action ] ) under the renormalization group .",
    "without a @xmath2 ( m ) term , the electromagnetic coulomb gas ( [ action ] ) can be renormalized either by following the ( anderson - yuval ) kosterlitz scheme @xcite or directly by an operator product expansion in the sine - gordon formulation @xcite .",
    "both methods amounts to study the product of the parafermion operators ( [ parafermions ] ) and give the same results .",
    "hence for seek of simplicity , we will follow the kosterlitz approach , extending the classical method to the presence of the @xmath2 term ( see @xcite for a detailed review of this method ) .    upon coarse graining the model by increasing the hard - core cut - off @xmath67",
    ", we leave the partition function ( [ partition ] ) invariant by defining scale dependent coupling constants and fugacities .",
    "three different contributions to these variables have to be considered : naive rescaling , fusion and annihilation of electromagnetic charges .",
    "the naive rescaling comes simply from the change of cut - off in the integration measure and the interaction @xmath81 : its gives the eigenvalue of the fugacities @xmath61 . upon infinitesimal increase of the cut - off @xmath82 ,",
    "the distance between two neighbors charges can become less than the new cut - off @xmath83 .",
    "when these two charges form a dipole , we integrate them out ( annihilation of charges ) , while we simply glue them into a single charge otherwise ( fusion of charges ) . in this last case",
    "we get a correction to the fugacity of the new charge , which together with the naive rescaling , reads the following scaling equation for the fugacities : [ rg - brut ] @xmath84 with the notation @xmath85 .    in the other case , the small dipoles we annihilate upon coarse graining screen the interaction between distant charges . in the partition function ( [ partition ] ) , the term involving two ( non zero ) charges @xmath86 and @xmath86 distant from @xmath87 can be expanded in @xmath88 ( the distance between distant charges ) and yields @xmath89 where @xmath90 and we have defined the composite electric component of the charges @xmath91 . using the antisymmetry of @xmath18 and reexponentiating this contribution , we can check the renormalisability of the model to order @xmath92 as this contribution can be cast into a contribution to the matrices @xmath93 and the fugacities .",
    "we obtain the following corrections to @xmath94 and @xmath41 to the order @xmath92 :    @xmath95 y^{2}_{{\\bf n}_{s},{\\bf m}_{s}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    notice the antisymmetry of the correction ( [ rg - m ] ) to @xmath18 .",
    "we can now derive the renormalization flow from these scaling equations .      in the following we will restrict our study to the model ( [ model - specific ] ) .",
    "contrarily to the usual case where the fugacities of electromagnetic charges are symmetric both in @xmath96 and @xmath58 @xcite , here this symmetry is broken by the presence of the @xmath2 coupling .",
    "as seen above with the t symmetry , changing @xmath96 to @xmath97 amounts to change also @xmath2 to @xmath98 , and similarly with the transformation @xmath99 .",
    "the only symmetry which does not modify either @xmath94 or @xmath2 corresponds to @xmath100 , which ensures the neutrality of the gas for any value of the couplings .",
    "hence we can not assume the @xmath58 or @xmath96 parity of the fugacities @xmath101 as the condition @xmath102 will not be preserved by the rg .    for the model ( [ model - specific ] )",
    "we need only to consider charges satisfying @xmath103 .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath104 for @xmath105 . the above rg equations ( 9 )",
    "can then be written in a more pleasant way , using the notation @xmath106 and @xmath107 : @xmath108 y_{n , m}^{2}+ { \\cal   o } ( y^{3})\\\\ \\label{rg2-t }   & & \\partial_{l } t = - 4\\pi^{2}p~ x \\sum_{n , m}m ( n+tm ) ~ y_{n , m}^{2}+ { \\cal   o } ( y^{3})\\\\\\label{rg2-y } & & \\partial_{l } y_{n , m}=2\\left(1-\\frac{p}{4x } ( n+tm)^{2 } -\\frac{p}{4}xm^{2 } \\right ) y_{n , m } + { \\cal   o } ( y^{2 } ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the last equation the non linear term from ( [ rg - m ] ) has been forgotten , being subdominant around each transition point .",
    "however it has to be taken into account when analyzing the topology of the whole phase diagram .",
    "the above rg equations correspond to the starting point of our analysis of the different transitions .",
    "their invariance under the duality transformations is made more explicit if we write them as a single equation for the complex coupling constant @xmath109 : @xmath110 on this last equation , the invariance under duality of the flow ( @xmath111 ) is obvious .",
    "the invariance under duality of these beta functions , which was assumed in previous studies of modular invariant models , have important consequences : as the axis @xmath112 is invariant ( in the limit of vanishing fugacities ) and thus correspond to a flow line of the above equations , we know from the action of the modular group on this flow line that all the flow lines of the phase diagram are either straigth lines or arcs of circles .",
    "the flow diagram obtained by numerically integrating these equations is shown on figure [ figure1 ] , where only charges with @xmath113 have been taken into account .      to derive the phase diagram from the renormalization analysis",
    ", we first find the domains where a charge @xmath104 proliferate .",
    "such a charge proliferate , or equivalently the parafermion operator ( [ parafermions ] ) associated with a charge @xmath114 is relevant , when the associated fugacity increases under rescaling . from the renormalization eigenvalue of the fugacities in ( [ rg2-y ] )",
    "we deduce that the pure electric charges @xmath115 are relevant only for @xmath116 . for @xmath117 the composites charges @xmath104 become relevant inside the circles @xmath118 $ ] centered on @xmath119 of radius @xmath120 .",
    "all this circles are thus tangent to the axis @xmath121 ( see figure [ figure1 ] ) .    each circle [ n , m ] is caracterised by a ratio @xmath122 instead of @xmath123 , as all charges @xmath124 with @xmath125 are generated under renormalization in this circle ( see figure [ figure1 ] ) .",
    "in the following we will write @xmath122 where @xmath58 is the minimal magnetic charge allowed in the circle .",
    "under renormalization , in a circle @xmath122 , @xmath106 flows to zero while @xmath126 is renormalized to @xmath127 .",
    "hence each rational point of the axis @xmath121 correspond to a fixed point of the rg , caracterising a given phase .",
    "the phase @xmath128 , stable for @xmath116 , can be viewed as a special circle of infinite radius , caracterised by @xmath129 . in this phase @xmath130 and @xmath126",
    "is slightly renormalized to a ( non universal ) real value .",
    "below @xmath131 and between all these circles , all the fugacities renormalize to zero , which correspond to a neutral phase of the coulomb gas , caracterised by non universal renormalized @xmath94 and @xmath2 and vanishing fugacities .    transitions in this phase diagram are a priori of two different types : the transitions between two circles caracterised by different ratio @xmath132 and the transition between a phase with relevant charge @xmath104 and the neutral phase .",
    "transitions of the first kind correspond to tangent points between circles in the phase diagram .",
    "such points exist only when @xmath133 .",
    "for @xmath134 , the circles overlap and these transitions are no more accessible by the present perturbative study , while for @xmath135 all circles with different ratio @xmath132 are disconnected and these transitions disappear . in the following",
    "we will consider in more detail the case @xmath133 , whose phase diagram is shown on figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "a transition between two phases ( ratios ) @xmath136 and @xmath137 is allowed if the two corresponding circles are tangent to each other , which can be written @xmath138 the corresponding transition point is located in @xmath139 . to analyze further these transitions",
    ", we need to remark that any circle @xmath132 can be deduced from the circle @xmath140 by succesive application of the transformations @xmath141 and the duality @xmath78 .",
    "moreover the circle @xmath140 itself is the image under @xmath78 of the line of phase transitions @xmath142 .",
    "the transition points between the phase @xmath140 and other @xmath143 ( see figure [ figure1 ] ) are all images under @xmath78 of the transitions points between @xmath144 $ ] and the phases @xmath145 $ ] , which themselves are related to the transitions @xmath144\\leftrightarrow [ 0,1]$ ] by action of @xmath79 and @xmath146 .",
    "thus all the transition points between two ratios @xmath132 and @xmath147 correspond to the same critical behaviour .",
    "similarly all transitions between a phase @xmath132 and the neutral phase ( no charge condensate ) are images of the transition between @xmath144 $ ] and this phase .",
    "we can now study these two transitions perturbatively in the @xmath101 .",
    "first at a transition between @xmath148 and @xmath149 we can write renormalization equations for the distance orthonormal to the transition point @xmath150 while the distance perpendicular to this axis is not renormalized to lowest order . using @xmath151 and @xmath152 we obtain",
    "@xmath153 which correspond to a kosterlitz - thouless like diverging correlation length @xmath154 . in both phases ,",
    "the correlation functions of the parafermion operators decays exponentially : @xmath155    the transition between the neutral phase and a circle @xmath132 is describe by a critical point with one marginal direction ( tangent to the circle ) and the same diverging correlation length . while the correlation function have the same kind of exponential decays from the circle side of the transition , they decay algebraically in the neutral phase : @xmath156",
    "within the context of the two parameters scaling theory of the quantum hall effect , the first idea consists in identifying the coupling of the coulomb gas model with the components of the conductivity tensor of the electron gas @xmath157 .",
    "the ratio @xmath132 defined in the above study naturally translate into the filling factors of the quantum hall states : each circle of the flow diagram correspond to a given quantum hall fluid and the renormalization equations we obtain provide the expected asymptotic value for this conductivity : @xmath158 . following this analogy",
    "we can find that transitions between two filling factors @xmath159 are allowed if they satisfy the expected relation ( [ relation - transition ] ) .",
    "all the allowed transitions between two plateaux are in the same universality , being related by the duality d ( [ dual ] ) which exchange the electric and magnetic charges , as in @xcite , thus supporting the superuniversality hypothesis@xcite .",
    "however we notice that in our flow diagram , filling factors with any denominators exist , while only even denominators are expected for quantum hall fluids .",
    "moreover fixed points corresponding to filling factors ( circles ) with even and odd denominators are related by modular transformations : hence one can not avoid the even denominators in this model .",
    "this result has to be related with recent works @xcite which reveal that the symmetry hidden behind the quantum hall hierarchies should be the subgroup @xmath160 of @xmath4 instead of the whole modular group .",
    "this subgroup is generated by the transformation @xmath161 ( instead of @xmath162 in this study ) which preserves the oddness of filling factors .",
    "this transformation , when restricted to the axis @xmath112 ( imaginary axis ) , correspond to @xmath163 .",
    "hence it does not exchange the high and low temperature phases of the usual electromagnetic coulomb gas@xcite .",
    "thus an extension of the usual electromagnetic model to a @xmath160 invariant theory will not simply correspond to the addition of a topological term as for the model studied in this article .    to conclude ,",
    "let us comment on the comparison with the recent studies which focus on the constraint on the beta function from the modular symmetry @xcite . this study ( together with @xcite ) assume a modular ( or @xmath160 ) symmetry in a model with two parameters @xmath7 , and derive the general form of the beta functions of this model . in our work the model ( [ partition ] )",
    "possess an infinite number of coupling constants corresponding to the electromagnetic charge fugacities .",
    "thus a direct comparison between the beta functions is not possible .",
    "however it should be noticed that our renormalization procedure provide the first explicit example of the commutation of the modular symmetry and the renormalization , which is the central hypothesis of @xcite .",
