    "the standard scenario for the chemical evolution of the galactic halo ( see e.g. tinsley 1979 ) is based on the different yields of type ia and type ii supernovae .",
    "it is well established that type ii supernovae mostly produce the so - called @xmath5-elements ( o , ca , mg , s , si and ti ) while type ia supernovae are responsible for the synthesis of the fe - group ( fe , co , ni , zn ) .",
    "given a different life - times of both types of supernovae ( 10@xmath6 years for type ii and 10@xmath7 years for type ia ) , it is expected that there will be overabundance of @xmath5 elements at [ fe / h]@xmath8 . at first glance",
    ", this behavior is observed in many metal - poor halo star ( mcwilliam 1997 ) .",
    "the precise trends of the [ @xmath5/fe ] ratio versus [ fe / h ] are still not clearly established .",
    "for instance , low [ @xmath5/fe ] ratios were found in several metal - poor halo stars ( carney et al .",
    "1997 ) and a rather complicated picture emerged from the comprehensive work by idiart & thevenin ( 2000 ) who studied [ ca / fe ] and [ mg / fe ] ratios in 252 halo and disk stars . on the other hand ,",
    "the [ o / fe ] ratio in unevolved stars show a linear rise ( israelian , garca lpez & rebolo 1998 , israelian et al .",
    "2001 ) with a slope @xmath40.33@xmath90.02 in the metallicity range 0@xmath10[fe / h]@xmath11 .",
    "apparently there is no general agreement about a unique @xmath12 [ @xmath5/fe]@xmath13 at [ fe / h]@xmath141 for @xmath5-elements such o , ca and mg .",
    "this statement can be extended to another @xmath5-element : sulphur .    in his extensive analysis franois ( 1987 , 1988 ) was able to delineate the [ s / fe ] trend down to the metallicity [ fe / h]=@xmath41.6 suggesting that the [ s / fe ] ratio in the halo could be constant at a value around 0.6 .",
    "the goal of this letter is to investigate whether unevolved halo stars at lower metallicities support the proposed trend .",
    "the observations were carried out in 2000 august 17 - 19 using the utrecht echelle spectrograph ( ues ) at the nasmyth focus of the 4.2-m wht at the orm ( la palma ) .",
    "the ccd detector was a 2148@xmath152148 pixel@xmath16 site1 .",
    "we obtained echelle spectra with a slit width @xmath31 which cover the wavelength range between 5220 and 9150   in 20 orders at a spectral resolving power of @xmath17 .",
    "all spectra were background and scattered light subtracted , flat - fielded and extracted using standard iraf procedures .",
    "the flat - field correction was attempted with a fast rotator , tungsten lamp and dome flats .",
    "however , the best correction from a severe fringing in the near - infrared was achieved with high quality dome flats .",
    "the wavelength calibration was performed with a th  ar lamp giving a dispersion of 0.087 pixel .",
    "the final signal - to - noise ratio of our spectra is provided in table 1 .",

    "these @xmath18-values combined with the equivalent widths 28 and 11 m  of the sulphur doublet derived from the high - resolution solar atlas ( kurucz et al .",

    "sulphur yields from standard type ii supernovae have been computed by many authors ( e.g. , woosley & weaver 1995 ; thielemann , nomoto , & hashimoto 1996 ) . the [ s / fe ] ratio in the ejecta is sensitive to the amount of mass going into the compact object formed during the supernova explosion ( i.e depend on the adopted mass cut ) .",
    "there is a range of values for this mass cut which can perfectly provide [ s / fe ] yields consistent with the observations .",

    "their computations show that [ s / fe ] ratios as those found in very low - metallicity stars can easily be produced in these explosions .",
    "for instance , it can be seen from table 2 of nakamura et al .",
    "( 2001 ) that the he core with a mass 16  m@xmath32 and 10@xmath1510@xmath31 erg explosion energy is able to provide a ratio [ s / fe]@xmath31.1 in the final ejecta .",
    "it is possible that the linear trend of [ s / fe ] can be explained by an increasing role of hypernovae in the early epochs of the galaxy formation ( i.e. , [ fe / h ] @xmath8 ) .",
    "the estimated galactic rate of type ic hypernovae is @xmath33  yr@xmath34 ( hansen 1999 ) but it could have been much higher in the early galaxy .",
    "small mass - loss rates due to the low metallicity in the first generations of massive halo stars could have led to large helium cores and the conservation of the primordial angular momentum .",
    "since hypernovae are favored by stars with a large helium core mass and rapid rotation , a significant sulphur production in the early galaxy could have been a rather common phenomenon .",
    "similar ideas have been put forward by qian and wasserburg ( 2001 ) to explain a linear rise in the [ o / fe ] ratio .",
    "extension of their model for the sulphur case would be very interesting .    additional observational support for large amounts of sulphur synthesized during type ii supernova / hypernova explosion comes from the analysis of the chemical composition of the low - mass star orbiting the black hole in the x - ray binary system gro j1655 - 40 ( israelian et al . 1999 ) .",
    "@xmath5 elements are uniformly enhanced in the atmosphere of the secondary star , and in particular a large amount of sulphur [ s / h]@xmath30.9 was found in the secondary star . most probably , this is a result of contamination from the matter ejected after supernova or hypernova explosion of the black hole stellar progenitor ( israelian et al . 1999 ,",
    "brown et al . 2000 ) . very recently ,",
    "combi et al . (",
    "2001 ) have detected a bubble in the large - scale hi distribution around gro j1655 - 40 providing new evidence for a supernova explosion in this system .",
    "another possible explanation for the monotonic increase in [ s / fe ] at low [ fe / h ] is related to a delayed deposition of the supernova synthesized products into the ism due to differences in transport and mixing . choosing a short mixing time ( @xmath3 1myr ) for oxygen ( a volatile ) , and longer mixing time ( @xmath3 30myr ) for fe ( refractory ) , ramaty et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001 ) suggest that [ o / fe ] should rise monotonically with a slope which is consistent with the observations of israelian et al .",
    "( 1998 , 2001 ) .",
    "a similar trend is also predicted ( ramaty et al .",
    "2001 ) for a volatile element like sulphur . as dicussed by ramaty et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001 ) , it is not necessary that other @xmath5-elements like mg and si follow the same trend as o and s since they are refractory elements with much longer mixing time in the ism . in summary , while more observations are clearly needed at very low metallicities in order to confirm the trend delineated in the present work , our new measurements do not seem to support a [ s / fe ] @xmath12 versus [ fe / h ] in halo stars .",
