    "superconducting junctions with topologically non - trivial barriers are predicted to host majorana bound states @xcite .",

    "candidates with high potential for the detection and manipulation of the majorana fermion @xcite are superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) @xcite .",
    "the appearance of majorana bound states in superconducting junctions enables tunneling of quasiparticles with charge @xmath2 across the junction , which doubles the josephson periodicity , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the doubled periodicity is predicted to lead to the absence of odd integer shapiro steps in individual junctions , and a squid modulation period of 2@xmath4 instead of the usual @xmath4 periodicity , with @xmath5 the magnetic flux quantum in superconductivity @xcite .",
    "experimental efforts have been made to contact superconductors to topologically non - trivial states @xcite .",
    "josephson effects have been observed , and squids have been reported @xcite .",
    "the first signatures of a majorana fermion , characterized by a zero bias conductance peak , have been observed in superconductor - semiconducting nanowire junctions @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , so far only @xmath4 periodic dependences have been observed .",
    "relaxation to equilibrium states @xcite , quantum phase slips @xcite , and the large bulk shunt present in contacts with topological insulators so far , may reduce the 2@xmath4 periodicity .",
    "a key question therefore is how to optimize the majorana character . here , we study extrinsic parameters that can be controlled to optimize the @xmath6 signal from the majorana fermion in dc squids composed of junctions containing both @xmath7 and @xmath6 components in different proportions .",
    "our main observation is that the squid parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 are important parameters altering the periodicity .",
    "furthermore , a superconducting interferometer will have the periodicity of the component with the smallest periodicity .",
    "nonetheless , even in dc squids with topologically trivial components the majorana character strongly influences the dc squid characteristics .",
    "this study is also of relevance for dc squids composed of junctions with higher order periodicities , occurring in sns and sfs systems @xcite .    ) and single electron tunneling by virtue of the majorana fermion ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the relative contribution of these two processes is determined by the factor @xmath8 .",
    "we analyze two scenarios , in ( a ) the superconductor is macroscopic and is in the trivial state , @xmath9 and in ( b ) the superconductor is in the topologically non - trivial state , @xmath10 . doubled periodicity is only observed when there is a topologically non - trivial state in the entire ring , as in ( b ) .",
    "however , the unusual current phase relation changes the dc squid characteristics even when the ring is not entirely topologically non - trivial.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in the next session we introduce fluxoid quantization in superconducting rings composed of topologically trivial and non - trivial parts",
    ". then we will use the fluxoid quantization conditions to determine the critical current in the squid under applied magnetic fields and derive the voltage state assuming that the junctions can be described with the resistively and capacitively shunted junction model .",
    "the fluxoid quantization in a superconducting loop @xmath11 leads to @xmath12 periodicity , with @xmath13 related to the charge carrier @xmath14 in the loop . in macroscopic systems , @xmath9 , but for mesoscopic systems on the order of the superconducting coherence length @xmath15 @xcite and systems including majorana fermions , @xmath13 can be either 1 or 2 depending on parity conservation @xcite . integrating the phase of a superconducting loop containing @xmath16 josephson junctions results in :    @xmath17    here",

    "we will consider scenarios where the superconductor is either trivial @xmath9 or topologically non - trivial @xmath10 . also we will consider the junctions to be trivial @xmath24 , topologically non - trivial @xmath25 or that both charge carrier types are present in the junctions .",
    "when the junctions are topologically non - trivial , but the superconductor is macroscopic , quantum phase slips can occur in the superconductor so that @xmath13 can be different from @xmath22 .",

    "we consider the dc squid to be symmetric , except for the current phase relationship of the individual junctions .",
    "inclusion of asymmetry ( e.g. inductance , critical current or capacitance asymmetry ) is easily included .",
    "however , inclusion will only lead to asymmetrical squid characteristics , and will not change the periodicity .",

    "the @xmath6 component is due to single electron tunneling by virtue of the majorana fermion resulting in the 4@xmath42 current phase relationship periodicity .",
    "the critical current for an applied external field is obtained by finding the solution of the fluxoid quantization equation with the maximal critical current .",

    "the decrease in modulation depth by increasing the @xmath6 component looks similar to increasing @xmath0 in standard squids .",

    "the damping of the current modulation with increasing bias voltage is characterized by @xmath72 , independent on the current phase periodicity , and squids with @xmath6 component junctions have therefore a smaller current modulation where the modulation is inverted , compared to standard squids . choosing a large @xmath0 will decrease the damping term and increase the amplitude of the voltage resonances .",

    "bulk shunting likely introduces @xmath7 terms in the current phase relation .",
    "quantum phase slips @xcite and quasiparticle poisoning @xcite will be relevant for all proposals , relaxing the system to @xmath7 periodicity .",
    "therefore , increasing the @xmath6 component is important for all these proposals .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is easily tunable .",
    "this squid parameter depends on the inductance , determined by the squid geometry , and independent of the individual junctions .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 is a junction parameter and therefore more difficult to tune .",
    "however , varying the length and width of the junctions and controlling the interface transparency tune @xmath1 .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied dc squids containing two topologically non - trivial barriers .",
    "the 2@xmath4 periodicity stemming from the majorana fermion can only be detected in non - trivial dc squids .",
    "however , even loops containing topologically trivial elements are influenced by the presence of junctions with @xmath6 components .",
    "this is observed both in the critical current modulation by flux and the resonance voltage .",
    "the squid parameters can be used to increase the relative component ; increasing @xmath0 is found to largely increase the component with the largest periodicity .",
    "the @xmath67 relation is altered when both components are present , and both components can be maximized at different bias currents , determined by the resonance voltage . in recently fabricated s - ti - s junctions , @xmath1 is usually low due to bulk shunting .",
    "this increases the resonance voltage to a regime where the damping is higher , which complicated observing a clear difference between @xmath4 and @xmath58 periodicities . decreasing this bulk",
    "shunt would therefore simplify the 2@xmath4 periodicity observation .",
    "nonetheless , the strong effect of @xmath0 ; large @xmath0 increases the 2@xmath4 component over 100 times , allows the detection of the majorana fermion , under the right intrinsic circumstances ( e.g. no relaxation to equilibrium ) , in dc squids composed of present day s - ti - s junctions .",
    "this result is also of relevance to devices where the majorana character is induced via other means , such as in semiconducting nanowires with strong rashba spin orbit coupling .",
    "tuning @xmath0 in combination with ac measurements to prevent relaxation paves the way to the observation of exotic properties of the majorana fermion .",
