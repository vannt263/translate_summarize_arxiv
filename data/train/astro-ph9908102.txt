    "it is of considerable interest to identify structures of galaxies at z@xmath71 to study the evolution of both galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) are obvious signposts around which to search for clusters at z@xmath71 . in hall & green ( 1998 ; hereafter hg98 ) we presented imaging of 31 rlqs at z=12 which revealed an excess population of predominantly red galaxies .",
    "most candidate excess galaxies seds are consistent with them being at the quasar redshifts and red due to high age or metallicity , but some are consistent with being heavily dust - reddened galaxies , and/or background galaxies at z@xmath72.5 . here and in hall _ etal . _",
    "( 1999 ) we present new observations of these fields and further analyses of existing data which strengthen many of our previous conclusions .",
    "in the past few years , narrow - band surveys have typically yielded a few detections per survey of h@xmath2 emitters at @xmath12 ( see teplitz , mclean & malkan 1999 ) .",
    "our rlq fields make promising targets for narrow - band searches for h@xmath2 emission at the quasar redshifts .",
    "we would hope to detect galaxies whose seds suggest they are dust - reddened and thus possibly actively star - forming and not to detect galaxies whose seds suggest they are old and dust - free .",
    "we observed q  0835 + 580 with irtf using a circularly variable filter ( cvf ) , q  2149 + 212 with cfht using a special narrow filter , and q  2345 + 061 with both .",
    "there is a @xmath13 detection in each of the three fields and two @xmath14 detections in the q  2345 + 061 field .",
    "q  0835 + 580  ( h@xmath21 ) is an unremarkable faint blue galaxy with sfr@xmath15=14.7@xmath162.5 @xmath17  yr@xmath18 .",
    "based on @xmath19-band data for this field , we estimate sfr@xmath20=5.3@xmath160.3 @xmath17  yr@xmath18 , in good agreement with sfr@xmath15 given the various uncertainties ( e.g. no correction for dust extinction has been made to either value ) .",
    "none of the nine very red galaxies within 20  of q  0835 + 580 were detected in h@xmath2 , strengthening the case for them being red due to age or metallicity instead of dust ( if they are at the quasar redshift ) .    in the q  2345 + 061 field ,",
    "the candidate h@xmath2",
    "emitter seen with irtf ( sfr@xmath15 = 4.9@xmath160.1 @xmath17  yr@xmath18 ) is not confirmed with cfht , but the irtf cvf is three times wider than the cfht narrow - band filter .",
    "if the h@xmath2 excess observed with irtf is real , the line must lie outside the cfht filter .",
    "conversely , the two @xmath14 detections ( sfr@xmath15=1.8@xmath160.4 @xmath17  yr@xmath18 ) are seen with cfht but not irtf .",
    "hoever , given the relative widths of the filters , lines of the strength seen in the cfht data could be present but lost in the noise in the irtf data .",
    "five detections over 10.156  in these three fields ( all among our top ten cluster candidates ) gives a surface density of 0.5@xmath21  arcmin@xmath22 , @xmath330 times higher than previous shallower surveys , even targeted ones .",
    "the deep cfht h@xmath2 images show that there are only three quasar - associated galaxies with star formation rates of @xmath23 within fields @xmath31  mpc wide centered on q  2149 + 212 and q  2345 + 061 .",
    "this is a lower limit which neglects extinction and the velocity dispersion of the clusters , but it illustrates the potential of deep wide - field narrow - band data in studying star formation rates in high redshift clusters .",
    "the presence of a number of galaxies with seds strongly indicative of substantial dust reddening in our rlq fields ( see hg98 ) suggested that they might be detectable sub - mm sources .",
    "thus we observed the fields of q  0835 + 580 , q  1126 + 101 , and q  2345 + 061 with scuba on the jcmt .",
    "the reduced jiggle maps were cross - correlated with the beam map and correlation coefficients measured ; a high value was required to accept any potential source as real .",
    "q  2345 + 061 was detected at @xmath24 , and q  1126 + 101 at @xmath25 .",
    "only one other source , dubbed q  1126 + 101 ( sm1 ) , is securely detected , but the limits on our relatively short exposures can only rule out luminosities @xmath1110@xmath26  l@xmath27 for galaxies at the quasar redshifts .",
    "q  1126 + 101 ( sm1 ) has two possible counterparts .",
    "the closest is a candidate quasar - associated red galaxy with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the next closest has a moderate @xmath32 and with @xmath33 is almost certainly foreground to the quasar .",
    "photometric redshifts and spectral types for the objects may help determine which i d is most plausible .",
    "we are calculating photometric redshifts and spectral types for objects in z@xmath71 quasar fields with multicolor imaging data to verify the existence of excess galaxies at the quasar redshifts or beyond , investigate such galaxies seds , and remove secure foreground objects from consideration for future spectroscopy . to compute photometric redshifts , a solar metallicity gissel model with synthetic kurucz spectra ( bruzual & charlot 1996 )",
    "was calculated for ages 020  gyr and z=04 assuming either an instantaneous burst or a constant sfr and with dust added using the calzetti ( 1997 ) extinction law for ten values of @xmath8@xmath5@xmath9 from 0 to 1.6 .",
    "fluxes were computed and compared to observations to construct @xmath34 contour plots in age-@xmath35 space for each value of @xmath8@xmath5@xmath9 for each sfr scenario .",
    "we present preliminary results on one object .",
    "q  1126 + 101 ( 425 ) was studied since it is the brightest `` j - dropout '' ( @xmath4@xmath5@xmath6@xmath72.5 ) in its field and it has a very red @xmath35@xmath5@xmath4@xmath72.7 . for",
    "either a constant sfr or instantaneous burst ( the latter being shown in figure 1 ) , the lowest @xmath34 is given by @xmath8@xmath5@xmath9@xmath30.5 . with @xmath36=3.5@xmath160.5 ,",
    "the object is background to the @xmath35=1.54 quasar at @xmath799.9% confidence for all @xmath8@xmath5@xmath9@xmath370.7 . for a constant sfr",
    ", the very red colors of q  1126 + 101 ( 425 ) require @xmath8@xmath5@xmath9@xmath70.5 at any @xmath35 to remain younger than the universe in any reasonable cosmology .",
    "the required dust is consistent with its @xmath4@xmath5@xmath6 color being redder than that of hr10 , the prototypical dusty ero ( extremely red object ) .",
    "however , the prediction of hg98 that this particular object would be at the quasar redshift seems to be erroneous .",
    "instead , it appears to be a member of the other @xmath4-band dropout population proposed in hg98 , namely galaxies at z@xmath112.5 which have red @xmath4@xmath5@xmath6 colors due to the redshifted 4000  break .",
    "these and other observations ( hall _ etal . _ 1999 ) are good evidence for galaxy overdensities around z@xmath71 rlqs , and for a population of red galaxies at z@xmath112.5 .",
    "if confirmed by spectroscopy with 8-m class telescopes , it may prove worthwhile to extend rlq host cluster searches to z@xmath72 by searching for  @xmath4-dropout \" galaxies ."
