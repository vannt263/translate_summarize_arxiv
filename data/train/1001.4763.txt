    "the study of ultracold atomic systems has received much attention in recent years , motivated largely by the prospect of realizing novel strongly correlated many - body physics .",
    "a series of remarkable experimental breakthroughs have produced an extremely well - controlled physics playground  @xcite .",
    "the latest breakthrough is the ability to associate atoms via a feshbach resonance to form ultracold molecules in the ro - vibrational ground state  @xcite , and the jila group has achieved a nearly degenerate gas of ground state polar molecules  @xcite .",
    "this is a true milestone in the program , since strong dipolar interactions between degenerate molecules in the presence of an external electric field allow for the design of exotic hamiltonians  @xcite and are expected to give rise to exciting phenomena including roton softening  @xcite , supersolidity  @xcite , artificial photons  @xcite , bilayer quantum phase transitions  @xcite , and multi - layer self - assembled chains  @xcite for bosonic molecules , and spontaneous interlayer superfluidity @xcite , itinerant ferroelectricity  @xcite , fermi liquid anisotropy  @xcite , fractional quantum hall effect  @xcite , wigner crystallization  @xcite , biaxial nematic phase  @xcite , topological superfluidity  @xcite , and a @xmath1 topological phase  @xcite for fermionic molecules .",
    "most , if not all , of these novel quantum phases will require temperatures on the order of @xmath2 or less ( with @xmath3 the fermi temperature ) , which will require further experimental advance .",
    "efforts to overcome the current obstacles of collisional instability and insufficient cooling are already underway , though , and given the rate of progress in reaching the current state - of - the - art , the future is bright  @xcite .",
    "however , it is worthwhile to ask what interesting effects one might be able to observe in the immediate future with the temperature on the order of @xmath3 .    from a condensed matter perspective ,",
    "the very idea of having a @xmath4 interaction rather than the usual coulomb interaction is intriguing .",
    "such a system has no parallel in solid state materials , and study of the previously unmotivated problem of many - body physics in a system interacting via a @xmath4 potential is still in its infancy .",
    "of course , the actual form of the inter - molecular interaction potential is quite complicated , particularly at short range , and the scattering and stability of the molecules are sensitive to these details @xcite .",
    "further investigation is required to allow full quantitative comparison between theory and experiment . for our purposes ,",
    "though , it is sufficient to take a @xmath4 interaction with some undetermined short - range cutoff ; the low - energy many - body physics of a stable , dilute gas should not depend qualitatively on the short - range details .",
    "it is then appropriate to consider what quantum many - body effects might be calculated for a gas with @xmath4 interactions that could be observed in cold polar molecule experiments .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the compressibility ( or equivalently , the ordinary sound dispersion ) , zero sound dispersion , and effective mass at finite temperatures comparable to those achieved in current experiments .",
    "these quantities should be readily accessible to experiment , and we present the first calculations to include thermal effects , as well as some trap effects .",
    "as these calculations are carried out within a leading order perturbation approximation in the dipolar coupling constant , we are working within the standard weak - coupling theory in the sense of the landau fermi liquid theory .",
    "this is the first theory one must do before one does anything else for the dipolar systems .    for dipolar interactions , in contrast to the familiar coulomb case",
    ", the weak - coupling regime corresponds to the _ low_-density limit .",
    "this is fortuitous , since current experiments can not achieve high densities without significant loss rates .",
    "for all practical purposes , the leading - order perturbative results are exact at typical experimental densities . however , lower densities correspond to higher @xmath0 , necessitating the calculations be done for finite temperature . as the density",
    "is increased , the leading - order perturbative results should remain qualitatively correct as long there is no phase transition to break adiabaticity .",
    "for very high densities one will enter the interesting strong - coupling regime and the weak - coupling theory will fail in a systematic way , but this regime is completely inaccessible at present in dipolar molecular systems .    in two - dimensional semiconductor - based electron systems and in graphene",
    ", studying compressibility experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite has been an important tool for studying quantum many - body effects in coulomb systems . in these two - dimensional condensed matter systems with the @xmath5 coulomb interaction , the hartree - fock approximation works remarkably well for understanding compressibility , even in the strongly interacting regime .",
    "this is a general result of the frequency independence of the compressibility , and not specific to the coulomb interaction .",
    "we allow for different trap geometries by considering uniform three - dimensional ( 3d ) , two - dimensional ( 2d ) , and one - dimensional ( 1d ) gases , as well as a nonuniform 3d gas in a periodic potential along @xmath6 .",
    "we find that under certain conditions the compressibility varies nonmonotonically with temperature .",
    "a closely related quantity with the same temperature dependence , @xmath7 ( with @xmath8 the fermi energy and @xmath9 the chemical potential ) , also varies nonmonotonically with density , even for temperatures on the order of @xmath3 .",
    "the zero sound speed and effective mass also exhibit nontrivial dependencies .",
    "however , in 3d , propagation of zero sound requires lower temperatures than currently feasible . in 2d and 1d , though , we find that zero sound propagates undamped even at experimentally realistic temperatures , assuming that the intermolecular potential behaves like @xmath4 at short enough distances .",
    "in the low - dimensional situations , the geometry with dipoles aligned perpendicular to their separations is particularly relevant as this is the most stable configuration conducive to our approximation of a @xmath4 interaction , so we will focus on this case .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : vq ] we review the form of the dipolar interaction in momentum space . in section  [ sec : results ] we present analytic low - temperature expansions for the self - energy , compressibility , and effective mass of a uniform system , as well as numerical results for arbitrary temperature .",
    "we also present numerical results for the zero sound mode . in section  [ sec : multilayer ]",
    "we numerically obtain the compressibility and low - lying collective modes for the spatially inhomogeneous case of a 1d periodic external potential dividing the 3d cloud into multiple quasi-2d layers . in section  [ sec : exp ] , we discuss experimental observation of quantum many - body effects in the compressibility , and we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] . in appendix",
    "a , we briefly compare with the case of coulomb interactions .",
    "we consider a gas of one - component fermionic molecules with number density @xmath10 , each possessing dipole moment @xmath11 , aligned by an external electric field @xmath12 so that the inter - molecular interaction potential at large separation @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the angle between @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
