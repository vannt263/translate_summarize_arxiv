    "the discovery of long - lived afterglow emission from gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has revolutionized the field by enabling redshift determinations and host galaxy identifications . in addition , by interpreting the emission in the theoretical framework of a relativistic shock wave expanding into a circumburst medium , broadband afterglow measurements can constrain the explosion geometry and energetics , as well as the properties of the surrounding medium @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic evolution of the blast - wave is strongly influenced by the the total energy in the shock , the geometry of the outflow and the density structure of the medium into which it is expanding .",

    "however , initial searches for an optical afterglow were unsuccessful until variable emission was identified at radio wavelengths @xcite .",
    "subsequent observations of the radio position uncovered a faint optical counterpart @xcite , as well as a relatively bright near - infrared ( nir ) transient @xcite . because of the delay in the identification of the optical afterglow , the early optical monitoring was somewhat sparse . in spite of the eventual detection of optical and nir counterparts ,",

    "we interpret the data in the framework of the cosmological fireball model ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , in which an energetic explosion accelerates a small amount of matter to ultrarelativistic velocities .",
    "internal shocks within this flow produce the burst event itself , while the relativistic shock propagating into the surrounding medium produces the afterglow .    in the model",
    ", we assume the ultrarelativistic shock transfers a constant fraction of its total energy to the magnetic field ( @xmath9 ) as well as a constant fraction to shocked , thermalized electrons ( @xmath10 ) . as in strong subrelativistic shocks",
    ", the electrons are assumed to be accelerated into a power  law distribution of energies ( p@xmath11 ) and they radiate via synchrotron emission under the influence of magnetic fields .",
    "this produces a broken power  law spectrum",
    "whose peak and spectral breaks evolve in time according to the shock s behaviour @xcite , set by the total energy in the shock , the geometry of the ejecta and the density of matter surrounding it .",
    "the specific model we used to fit the data is outlined in some detail in harrison  ( 2001 ) .",
    "it includes the effects of inverse compton ( ic ) scattering on the shock evolution and emitted radiation spectrum as prescribed by sari & esin ( 2001 ) .",
    "it allows for a conical ( jet - like ) outflow geometry with half - opening angle @xmath12 ( using the treatment given by sari , piran & halpern ( 1999 ) ) , and for expansion into a medium of constant density @xmath13 , or a medium with a density gradient , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath14 . the latter density profile would be typical of a medium altered by the wind of a massive star ( in this case the grb progenitor ) .",
    "in addition , we calculate and include radiative corrections to the shock energy . this is a refined method as compared to the adiabatic evolution typically assumed in our previous work @xcite .",
    "we approximate the radiative evolution by treating the shock at each moment as though it were instantaneously adiabatic , with an energy calculated at that particular time .",
    "this is an appropriate treatment as long as losses are moderate , with the change in energy being slow .",
    "in addition to the basic input physics describing the evolution of the fireball outlined above , the broadband model for grb afterglows incorporates several additional effects resulting from propagation of the radiation between the fireball and the observer .",
    "these include interstellar scintillation in the centimeter radio regime , dust extinction in the optical / nir regime , and a contribution to the emission from the host galaxy of the grb .",
    "these features are evident in the data , and must be included to derive accurate model parameters .",
    "interstellar scintillation ( iss ) , due to the turbulent ionized gas of our galaxy distorting wavefronts propagating to the observer , can be important at radio wavelengths @xcite",
    ". we account for iss by first estimating the fractional variation in the flux density expected by these distortions @xcite .",
    "this uncertainty in the model flux is added in quadrature to the statistical uncertainties in the measured values when estimating @xmath15 .",
    "dust within grb host galaxies ( either in the circumburst environment or along the line of sight ) is a source of extinction for optical / nir afterglows @xcite which must be accounted for in modeling the optical spectrum .",
    "the frequency dependence of the extinction curve is uncertain , since we know little about the ism properties of the  host galaxy . for , the observed red optical to near - ir afterglow spectrum",
    "@xcite suggests a steep extinction curve .",
    "the best characterized ( relatively ) steep extinction law is for the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "we therefore adopt the smc bar extinction curve from weingartner & draine ( 2001 ) , which is parameterized by the extinction level @xmath16 in the rest frame of the host galaxy .",
    "other extinction curves were used in model attempts and did not substantially change the results . depending on its luminosity , the host galaxy of the grb may contribute a background level which dominates the total brightness at late times .",
    "this is observed as a flattening of the light curves , chiefly in the optical and ir . for",
    ", we include a constant term for the r , i , h and k to represent the host emission , and the values of these terms are fit by the model .",
    "the j - band only includes a single data point , so we interpolate the host term between the i and h fits .",
    "evidence for host emission has also been observed at centimeter wavelengths @xcite , again deduced from late - time flattening of the lightcurve .",
    "the radiation at these wavelengths would most likely result from synchrotron and thermal bremsstrahlung in galaxies undergoing substantial star formation @xcite .",
    "we include the possibility of centimeter host emission in our model , where we fit for the normalization at 1.43 ghz , and scale other bands as @xmath17 . in light of recent claimed detections of grb hosts at submillimeter wavelengths",
    "@xcite , we consider the possibility of a submillimeter host , and allow for such a component in the fit , with a modified blackbody as in frail  ( 2001 ) , parameterized by its flux at 350 ghz . this last host component was found not to be required for our best model .",
    "the afterglow model described in  [ sec : fitting ] was fit to the data summarized in tables [ tab : optical]-[tab : table - jcmt ] .",
    "in addition , we included all previously published data in the x - ray @xcite , optical @xcite , and radio @xcite bands .",
    "we converted the x - ray measurements to flux values using a photon index of 2.4 .",
    "we corrected the optical data for absorption in our galaxy @xcite before converting to flux densities using the factors in bessell ( 1979 ) for the optical and bessell & brett ( 1988 ) for the near - ir bands . to account for any cross - calibration uncertainty",
    ", we have added in quadrature 5% uncertainties to all the measured fluxes .    the model which best describes this broadband dataset is a collimated outflow expanding into a constant density medium .",

    "the @xmath15 for the fit is 116.4 for 92 degrees of freedom .",
    "although we derived fits for three representative redshifts ( @xmath18 ) , the results of which are all shown in table  [ tab : model ] , we confine our detailed comments below to the @xmath19 solution .",
    "this choice of representative redshifts was made based upon the range of likely @xmath20 for this burst .",
    "very high redshifts @xmath21 are not considered as they are not compatible with the underlying host s colors , as detailed in ",
    "[ sec : host ] .",
    "a redshift @xmath22 is considered implausible due to the lack of lines expected to be detected ( if @xmath22 ) in several spectra taken of the host .",

    "many of the basic conclusions do not depend on the redshift , or can be easily scaled given the information below . in  [ sec : alter ] we discuss some of the limitations of our best fit , as well as some alternate models which also fit the data , but only with unphysical parameters .    in the best model for @xmath19 ,",
    "the isotropic - equivalent fireball energy at the time when the fireball evolution becomes nearly adiabatic ( @xmath25 ) is approximately @xmath26  ergs .",
    "the measured gamma - ray fluence for this grb is @xmath27 erg @xmath28 ( @xcite ) , so the isotropic gamma - ray energy is @xmath29 erg .",
    "the large energy budgets inferred for both the shock @xmath25 and the emitted gamma - ray radiation @xmath30 derived assuming isotropy are greatly reduced in this model by the relatively large degree of collimation ( jet opening angle of @xmath31 ) .",
    "a similar degree of collimation has been inferred previously in grb afterglows :",
    "grb has @xmath32 @xcite and grb has @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "for a two - sided jet this implies a total energy in the fireball shock of @xmath34  ergs , similar to the energy released in supernovae .",
    "likewise , for @xmath19 the geometry - corrected gamma - ray energy is reduced to @xmath35 erg , a value that is in good agreement with the mean of @xmath36 erg derived from a larger sample @xcite .",
    "we note the total energy is similar ( @xmath37 ) for @xmath38 , and a factor of about three higher for @xmath39 .",
    "the energy quoted in table [ tab : model ] is a lower limit on the true initial energy of the blastwave since it is derived at a time @xmath40=6.1 d , when the lowest energy electrons can cool within the dynamical timescale of the system .",
    "observationally , this corresponds to the time when the cooling break @xmath41 crosses the spectral break which results from the low - energy cutoff in the input electron energy spectrum , @xmath42 .",
    "this criterion separates the two regimes of radiative losses ; early times when radiant energy results in a decrease in the blastwave energy with time , and late times when the blast - wave evolution is adiabatic . for our best model ,",
    "radiative losses are important , but not extreme even at early times , since the fraction of energy in radiating electrons is not dominant ( @xmath10=12% ) .",
    "we estimate that from the time the grb ends ( @xmath43  10 - 100s post - trigger ) , to when the blastwave is nearly adiabatic , the energy drops by a factor of five .",
    "if we restrict the interval to begin when the first afterglow data were measured , ( @xmath44 d for the first data point to @xmath45 ) , the energy drops by a factor of 1.6 . from the time @xmath46 until late times the energy drops by only 15% .",
    "the energy in the fireball derived from our model significantly exceeds the emitted gamma - ray energy , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath47 . as discussed above , the initial fireball energy will be even larger if radiative losses are taken into account .",
    "this is the case for the majority of grb afterglows with energies derived from model fits ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . in the fireball model , it is likely that the energy remaining in the shock during the afterglow exceeds that of the prompt gamma - ray emission of the grb event itself ; this will be the case for a radiative efficiency of @xmath48 50% during the grb .",
    "the radiative efficiency of internal shocks driving the prompt grb are expected to be @xmath43  10% , not @xmath49  50% , leaving most of the initial shock energy in the fireball @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the energy fraction in magnetic field , @xmath5017% , to that in the electrons , @xmath10=12% , determines the relative importance of comptonization .",
    "compton scattering can contribute significantly to the total cooling rate if the ratio of electron to magnetic energy fractions is greater than unity @xcite .",
    "in our best model for , this ratio is of order unity ,",
    "so comptonization does not dominate the electron cooling , but it is a non - negligible effect .",
    "flux from compton scattering can in fact be seen peaking in the x - rays in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ]  and  [ fig6 ] , largely as a result of the steep electron spectral index . for an electron energy spectral index of 2 , with equal energies in each logarithmic frequency interval ( the infinite - energy limit ) , the ic luminosity would be lower than the synchrotron luminosity at all frequencies , and no ic peak would be observable in the spectrum .",
    "the index of @xmath51 derived for the best model puts less energy in each successive decade above the peak frequency . with a significant circumburst electron density providing a non - negligeable opacity to compton scattering",
    ", the peak of the ic flux density , above the synchrotron peak , dominates the total flux near the x - rays .",
    "the circumburst medium density derived from the model , @xmath52 @xmath3 , is comparable to that of grb @xcite and that of several other bursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "this relatively high density , in reference to an average galactic ism , can be inferred from the measured value of the self - absorption break @xmath53 @xcite , which is shown in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "the frequency @xmath54 depends upon other fundamental parameters besides the ambient density ( @xmath55 ) , and in this particular case the high @xmath54 results from the relatively high density , combined with a moderate electron energy fraction .",
    "models with low circumburst densities ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath2 @xmath3 ) can not be fit to the data by adjusting the energy and electron fraction .",
    "highly radiative models , with large electron energy fractions , can provide reasonable fits to the data , but the densities ( depending on the redshift of the fit ) vary from approximately the same as to an order of magnitude greater than those for the best model ( see  [ sec : alter ] ) .",
    "we infer the presence of measurable flux from the grb host galaxy in the optical from the late - time flattening of the lightcurves ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . in the final epoch of our optical observations",
    "the measured brightness of r=26.53@xmath80.22 ( see table [ tab : optical ] ) is essentially entirely due to the host , and is only 1.5 mag fainter than the median r magnitude for known grb host galaxies @xcite .",
    "our measured magnitude differs from the preliminary value of r=27.7@xmath80.3 given by holland _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) .",

    "this steep slope , however , is not reflected in the host spectrum .",
    "the afterglow at 0.7 days after the burst is significantly redder ( r@xmath56i=2.7@xmath80.4 ) than the host galaxy ( r@xmath56i=0.2@xmath80.3 ) itself ( note that the quoted r@xmath56i above are corrected for galactic extinction ) . from the absence of a strong @xmath57 break in the host spectrum , we can rule out a redshift of @xmath58 for .",

    "if real , a radio host at @xmath68jy would be about 1/3 the host flux density found for grb @xcite .",
    "we note that the submillimeter data are in good agreement with the afterglow model ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) , and we do not require any host contribution in this band .",
    "the best fit model given in  [ sec : ag ] , while not a unique interpretation of the data , is a self - consistent solution that derives reasonable values for the blastwave energy @xmath69 , the opening angle @xmath12 , the ambient density @xmath13 and the parameters of the shock ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) .",
    "a collimated outflow expanding into a constant density medium describes _ all _ the data well , addressing puzzling features described in previous attempts to fit this afterglow @xcite without invoking a very high redshift or other additional components .",

    "a similar behavior was also observed for the afterglow of grb @xcite . within the context of the standard fireball model",
    "there are three ways to produce this behavior . first , if the flux evolution is observed after collimation of the ejecta becomes evident in the light curve decay ( _ i.e. _ , post - jet ) , then @xmath75 ( @xcite ) . for our best model ,",
    "this is what produces the observed peak flux cascade .",
    "alternately , a density gradient @xmath76 in the surrounding medium ( a stellar wind model ) will give @xmath77 @xcite .",

    "formally , this model fits the data better than the `` best model '' presented in the previous section , however , it reaches the unphysical edge of parameter space , and with extreme radiative losses our near - adiabatic treatment breaks down and can not be fully trusted .",

    "in addition to the unphysical assumption about the electron energy partition , this model also has an electron spectral index approaching two , and hence a diverging total energy .",

    "even a fairly comprehensive dataset such as this can not constrain fundamental parameters without knowing the distance .",
    "this is because the synchrotron emission can be reproduced at different @xmath20 simply by rescaling the physical parameters by appropriate powers of @xmath93 .",
    "only `` second order '' effects such as host extinction , the ic component and radiative corrections do not directly re - scale with @xmath94 . in principle , we could include @xmath20 as a free parameter in the model , and fit for the best value . in practice , however , the combination of the sparseness of the real dataset , and the uncertainties in the model prevent any unique redshift determination .",
    "this is evident from table  [ tab : model ] , where we show a good fit with reasonable physical parameters for all three redshifts .",
    "the absence of a strong break in the host galaxy spectral colors ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) allows us to place an upper limit on the host redshift .",
    "spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fittings to host colors may place a stronger constraint ( _ e.g. _  @xcite , concerning the 970228 event ) , especially if the factor of @xmath43 four decline from k - band to i - band can be modelled by a balmer break",
    ". further hst imaging in optical bands might prove fruitful in this regard .",
    "the absence of a redshift is responsible in part for the relatively large and uncertain estimate of the electron index @xmath70 in our best model .",
    "the post - jet evolution of the optical light curves is determined by @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this data is sparsely sampled at early times ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , prior to when the host galaxy dominates the light .",
    "likewise , the index @xmath70 determines the shape of the synchrotron spectrum , and should therefore be derivable from the measurements . at optical wavelengths , however , there is a degeneracy between @xmath70 and the dust extinction law  the latter of which can depend sensitively on @xmath20 . lacking any knowledge about the extinction properties of dust in high redshift galaxies we adopted the smc extinction law .",
    "neither the x - ray spectral slope , nor the x - ray to optical flux ratio can break this degeneracy , since the contribution from inverse compton scattering alters the x - ray flux normalization as well as the spectrum .",
    "finally , we note that both our best solution and the highly radiative solution fail to predict the early radio emission at 8.46 ghz ( @xmath95 d ) .",
    "this level of fluctuation is too great to be accounted for by the estimated iss effects .",
    "prompt , short - lived radio emission in excess of the normal afterglow component has been detected toward other grbs @xcite .",
    "this is usually attributed to radiation from a reverse shock @xcite , and we suggest that this may explain the bright early - time radio point for .",
    "the new observations presented here , along with the data in the literature , form a complete collection of broadband measurements for the afterglow from the bright burst  beginning from early to late times . we have used these data together with a comprehensive fireball model to deduce fundamental physical parameters of the event ( energy , geometry , density ) and to measure the properties of the host galaxy .",
    "the late - time optical / nir data shows that the host is significantly bluer than the afterglow .",
    "thus we reject the hypothesis that the very red afterglow colors were due to lyman-@xmath24 absorption in the intergalactic medium to a very high redshift source .",
    "all of the afterglow s features can be explained over a wide range of @xmath20 by a model in which the ejecta are collimated in a jet .",
    "significant dust extinction is inferred within the host galaxy and a moderately high circumburst density @xmath83 @xmath3 is required .",
    "although this collimated model is not a unique solution to the data , it explains the red optical / nir color and the cascade in the peak flux from submillimeter to centimeter wavelengths ( see  [ sec : alter ] ) without resorting to an extreme redshift @xmath96 or requiring additional complications in the host galaxy s properties .",
    "models which invoke isotropic geometry require such complications , circumburst densities up to 10 times higher , as well as large , unphysical radiative corrections . correcting the isotropic - equivalent gamma - ray energy release for the collimation , for @xmath91 we obtain @xmath97  ergs .",
    "this value is typical of other events to date and is easily accounted for by current progenitor models .",
