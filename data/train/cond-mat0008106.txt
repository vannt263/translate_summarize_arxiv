    "in this paper , we have shown consistency of the mfss assumption ( [ s_hom ] ) and the cfss assumption ( [ g_hom ] ) , which puts previous papers on mfss on a firmer footing . as the consistency is shown in an asymptotic sense for large system sizes @xmath2 , the result does not necessarily imply that both finite - size scaling theories work equally well for given finite system - sizes .",
    "in fact , it might be the case that in one ensemble or the other , the finite - size scaling region may be reached for smaller system sizes and the quantities under investigation may converge faster towards their infinite system value .",
    "it is worth noting that the mfss assumption ( [ s_hom ] ) also includes the case where @xmath45 is independent of one or more of the variables indicated .",
    "this leads to the astonishing observation that even for a microcanonical entropy which is _ independent of the system size _ , canonical quantities show system size dependence according to the cfss laws ( see ref .",
