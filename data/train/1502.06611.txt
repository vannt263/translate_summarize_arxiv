    "these calibration frames were used to correct for blaze efficiency , pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations , and also to provide a first order flux calibration using the expected photon counts from the blackbody unit .",

    "although maser velocities are primarily at @xmath92  km  s@xmath1 , absorption by gas in small , shocked clumps could explain the small covering fraction required by our analysis .",
    "given the above , we posit that the h@xmath3o absorption observed with exes arises in hot , dense gas at the base of the blue - shifted outflow .",
    "water emission attributed to the outflow component is observed with hifi in multiple transitions as a broad feature @xcite , but is centered closer to the systemic velocity of the envelope than the absorption we see .",
    "analysis of the h@xmath3o outflow emission by @xcite indicates a temperature of @xmath9390  k and column density of @xmath94  @xmath9 , similar to results found by @xcite who analyzed unresolved h@xmath3o absorption observed with pacs on _ herschel _ , finding @xmath95  k and @xmath96  @xmath9 .",
    "these values are significantly below what we find , suggesting that exes and hifi / pacs observations trace different components . between the broad and narrow water emission observed with hifi , the broad absorption observed with exes , and the abundant maser spots , it is evident that the water - containing gas in afgl  2591 is both spatially and kinematically complex .",
    "interpreting the various observations of h@xmath3o in afgl  2591 in unison will require utilizing a physical model that includes radiative transfer accounting for absorption , stimulated and spontaneous emission , and collisional ( de-)excitation , as well as kinematic and geometric effects .",

    "analysis of the level populations assuming @xmath83 results in @xmath8  @xmath9 for lte at @xmath10  k. line profiles best match the blue - shifted outflow component , and we ascribe the absorption to hot , dense gas at the base of the outflow .",
