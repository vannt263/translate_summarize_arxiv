    "but the ansatz strongly suppresses the role of vector mesons by a factor of @xmath145 , since one obtains @xmath146 in the skyrme - term - stabilized soliton solution .",
    "for example , this factor amounts to 0.56 , 0.25 and 0.09 for the cases of @xmath147(892 mev ) , @xmath148(2010 mev ) and @xmath149(5325 mev ) , respectively .",
