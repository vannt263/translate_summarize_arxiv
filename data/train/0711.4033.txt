    "single electron tunneling through molecular bridges in nanodevices is inevitably accompanied by excitation of vibrational modes .",
    "vibration - assisted processes usually manifest themselves in tunneling through nanodevices as phonon satellites , which arise around main resonance peaks ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . however , phonon assistance may _ induce _ resonance peak due to interplay with magnetic degrees of freedom in transition metal - organic complexes ( tmoc ) .",
    "appearance of kondo - type zero bias anomaly in tunneling through tmoc was predicted recently @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider multiphonon processes in kondo tunneling in presence of magnetic field .",
    "we discuss the fine tuning effect of magnetic field on the kondo tunneling induced by multiphonon processes in a situation , where the ground state of tmoc with even occupation is a spin singlet . in this case",
    "the kondo resonance in tunneling arises when the phonon emission compensates the gap between one of projections of the excited high - spin and the ground zero spin state of tmoc .",
    "then the kondo - like effect arises due to singlet / triplet transitions , which can be treated as effective spin - flip processes @xcite .",
    "phonon - assisted electron tunneling through tmoc as well as tunneling through other nanoobjects ( quantum dots , nanotubes , ets ) is described within a framework of anderson model supplemented with the terms describing vibrational degrees of freedom and their interaction with electron subsystem @xcite @xmath0 here @xmath1 stands for the electrons in the @xmath2-shell of tmoc .",
    "it includes strong coulomb and exchange interaction , which predetermine the spin quantum numbers of the corresponding electron configuration @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is even ) ) , @xmath5 contains electrons in the metallic leads playing role of source @xmath6 and drain @xmath7 in the electric circuit , @xmath8 is responsible for electron tunneling between tmoc and leads , @xmath9 describes vibrational degrees of freedom in tmoc , and the interaction between electronic and vibrational subsystems is given by the last term @xmath10 . following the approach developed in @xcite",
    "we choose the phonon - assisted tunneling as a source of this interaction and represent vibrational subsystem by a single einstein mode @xmath11 .",
    "then three last terms in ( [ h1 ] ) are written as @xmath12 here the operators @xmath13 stand for phonons , @xmath14 describe electrons in the leads @xmath15 and the d - shell of tm ion , respectively , @xmath16 is the electron - phonon coupling constant .",
    "when deriving ( [ h2 ] ) we assumed that the coupling is strong enough , so that multiphonon processes are treated exactly by means of the lang - firsov canonical transformation ( cf .",
    "another canonical transformation of schrieffer - wolff ( sw ) type @xcite excludes @xmath8 from the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) and maps it on an effective hilbert subspace with fixed ( even ) number of electrons , singlet ground state and low - lying triplet excited state of tmoc .",
    "the effective sw - like hamiltonian is @xmath17 ( see @xcite ) . here",
    "[ the first two terms in ( [ h3 ] ) ] is represented only by spin degrees of freedom , @xmath19 is the energy of singlet - triplet ( s - t ) transition , @xmath20 is the spin operator and its @xmath21-projection , @xmath22 is the parameter of zeeman splitting in external magnetic field @xmath23 .",
    "the electron spin operator is given by the conventional expansion @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the pauli vector .",
    "unlike the conventional sw hamiltonian , our hamiltonian ( [ h3 ] ) contains one more vector @xmath26 , which describes three components of s - t transitions @xcite .",
    "this vector will be specified below .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction is now built into the effective exchange constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 . here",
    "@xmath29 are the energies of addition of an electron from the leads to the tm ion in a triplet and singlet states , respectively .",
    "the essence of the mechanism of phonon - assisted kondo cotunneling as it was formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite , is that the spin excitation energy gap @xmath30 which quenches the conventional kondo effect in a nanoobject with even occupation , may be compensated by the energy of virtual phonon emission / absorption processes . as a result",
    "the zero bias anomaly ( zba ) arises in tunnel conductance in spite of the zero spin ground state of the nanoparticle .",
    "this mechanism implies fine tuning @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the characteristic kondo energy , which is rather restricttive condition .          to make situation more flexible",
    ", we address here to the case of strong electron - phonon interaction and apply magnetic field as an additional tuning instrument .",
    "the main ideas are illustrated by figs .",
    "the zeeman term in the hamiltonian ( [ h3 ] ) is responsible of splitting of the triplet state @xmath36 into 3 components with spin projections @xmath37 . if the condition @xmath38 is satisfied ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) , then the states @xmath39 form effective vector operator @xmath40 with components @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , which acts effectively as a spin 1/2 operator and enters the sw hamiltonian ( [ h3 ] ) ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "the term @xmath44 is responsible for kondo - type resonance tunneling in accordance with the mechanism proposed in @xcite for zero magnetic field , where all three components of spin @xmath45 are involved .",
    "if the resonance condition is fulfilled for @xmath4-phonon processes , @xmath46 then the kondo tunneling is assisted by virtual excitation of @xmath4-phonon `` cloud '' ( fig .",
    "if the condition @xmath47 is valid , then the opposite spin projection @xmath48 is involved in kondo tunneling , and the vector @xmath40 has the components @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , which renormalizes the bare vertex @xmath52 due to phonon emission / absorption processes and logarithmically divergent parquet insertions .",
    "this dressed vertex is shown in fig .",
    "[ fvert1 ] . to use the feynman diagrammatic technique ,",
    "the spin operators are represented via effective spin - fermion operators @xcite .    .",
    "solid and dashed lines denote spin - fermion and conduction electron propagators , all parquet series are incorporated in the insertion shown by the square box .",
    "the multiphonon propagator is shown by the wavy line .",
    ", width=132 ]    the wavy line corresponds to a single - phonon propagator in the case shown in fig .",
    "then the straightforward calculation similar to that presented in @xcite gives for the corresponding vertex @xmath53}\\right ) } { 1-(\\rho j_r ) ^2\\log^2\\left(\\displaystyle\\frac{d}{{\\rm max}[k_bt , h,|\\delta-\\hbar\\omega - h|]}\\right)}\\right]~.\\ ] ] here @xmath54 is the temperature , @xmath55 is the effective width of the electron conduction band and @xmath56 is the density of states on the fermi level .",
    "the tunnel transparency @xmath57 is proportional to @xmath58 , and it is seen from ( [ g1 ] ) , that the kondo peak arises as a zba in @xmath57 , provided @xmath59 . if the multiphonon processes are involved in accordance with fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , then the wavy line in the diagram for @xmath60 corresponds to the multiphonon propagator @xcite weighted with pekarian distribution , and the vertex function transforms into a sum of phonon satellites @xmath61      here @xmath64 is the huang - rhys factor and @xmath65 is the polaron shift .",
    "this equation is valid at @xmath66 and @xmath67 , otherwise the satellites smear into a single hump around the maximum of pekarian distribution . since @xmath68 only one phonon replica satisfying the condition @xmath69 survive at _ given _ magnetic field @xmath23 .",
    "this means that changing @xmath23 one may `` scan '' the pekarian function in a certain interval . in case illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] second system of satellites arises with kondo peaks satisfying condition @xmath70 .",
    "since phonon - assisted kondo tunneling is essentially non - equilibrium process , one should estimate the contribution of decoherence and dephasing effects .",
    "similar problem was discussed in @xcite for a situation where the gap @xmath30 is compensated by finite source - drain bias . to evaluate these effects",
    ", one should calculate the damping of s - t excitation ( imaginary part of the corresponding self energy stemming from the vertex part shown in fig .",
    "[ fvert1 ] ) . performing calculations in analogy with @xcite ,",
    "one gets for the lifetime @xmath71 the estimate @xmath72 this damping should be compared with the kondo energy extracted from ( [ g1 ] ) , @xmath73 .",
    "the competition between two quantities reminds that between the indirect exchange @xmath74 and the kondo energy in the doniach diagram for kondo lattices @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the doniach dichotomy , in our case @xmath32 dominates in the most part of the phase space because @xmath75 contains small parameter @xmath76 comparing to @xmath77 ( see fig . [ fig5 ] ) thus , the spin - phonon relaxation is not detrimental for the phonon - assisted kondo effect for realistic model parameters .",
    "one more interesting situation is the case where two vibration modes exist in a molecule , one of which may be put in a resonance with the state @xmath78 at some field @xmath79 , whereas another one may be tuned to the state @xmath80 at @xmath81 .",
    "[ ftwo ] ) .        to conclude",
    ", we have demonstrated that the multiphonon emission / absorption processes may initiate kondo effect in tmoc with the ground singlet state in a situation where the electron tunneling from metallic reservoir to a @xmath2 orbit of tm is accompanied by polaronic effect in molecular vibration subsystem .",
    "the release of vibrational energy compensates the singlet - triplet gap in the spin excitation spectrum . varying the zeeman splitting in external magnetic field",
    ", one may scan the pekarian distribution of kondo - phonon satellites in tunneling conductance .",
    "magnetic field tuning changes drastically the character of phonon - assisted kondo screening . in zero magnetic field",
    "the spin @xmath45 is underscreened by phonon - assisted kondo processes @xcite , whereas the zeeman splitting results in reduction of effective spin from 1 to 1/2 and hence to complete kondo screening .",
    "one make hope to observe this phenomenon in the device with suspended nanotube , which plays part of a quantum dot@xcite .",
    "the frequency of the stretching mode in this nanotube is comparable with the values of magnetic field used in standard experiments ( @xmath82 ) , so one may hope that the zero bias anomalies in kondo tunneling assisted with one and two phonons ( @xmath83 in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) may be detected in this device .",
