    "the poisson random hypergraph model ( introduced in @xcite ) which is the subject of this paper may be considered as a step towards developing random combinatorial structures which one can fit to real - world phenomena . with this aim in mind , the class of hypergraphs in which every edge has the same number of vertices , whilst being a clean and elegant object",
    ", may be too narrow to be useful .",
    "we find it remarkable that , despite the flexibility afforded by its large number of parameters , the class of poisson random hypergraphs admits tractable computations for the asymptotic size of key structures .",
    "it is conventional in random combinatorics to impose a uniform rather than a poisson structure . for large @xmath0 , this makes little difference so long as one is concerned with ",
    "local \" random variables , for example , the number of edges at a given vertex .",
    "a global poisson structure is natural probabilistically in that it maximizes independence . in contrast , in the uniform case , by specifying an exact total number of hyperedges of a given size , one imposes dependencies at a global level which may be considered unnatural . for many questions , including those addressed in this paper",
    ", we would expect to find similar asymptotic behaviour for poisson and uniform models .",
    "this has already been verified by one of us  @xcite in respect of the numbers of identifiable vertices .",
    "suppose we have a set of vertices @xmath7 of size @xmath0 .",
    "then for @xmath8 a sequence of non - negative real numbers , we define a poisson random hypergraph with parameters @xmath9 to be a random map @xmath10 such that @xmath11 whenever @xmath12 , with @xmath13 independent .",
    "then @xmath14 is the number of hyperedges over @xmath15 ( so that we are allowing multiple edges over a set ) .",

    "continue until there are no more patches on the hypergraph .",
    "then the order of this collapse does not affect the set of vertices eventually removed ( see @xcite ) , called the set of _ identifiable _ vertices , which we denote by @xmath30 .",

    "in order to provide intuition about essential edges , we consider first the case of a random graph with patches .",

    ".    a 2-edge in a random graph with patches is essential if and only if removing it splits its component into two disconnected components , exactly one of which has a patch on it .",
    "in particular , edges in cycles are not essential ; an edge in a path between two patches is not essential ; edges in components with no patches can not be essential ( they are not even identifiable ) . all edges in a tree - component with a single patch are essential .",
    "we now describe a connection with the 2-core of a random graph , that is the maximal subgraph with minimum degree 2 .",
    "( the 2-core consists of all vertices on cycles and on paths between cycles . )",

    "we do not attempt to provide a fully rigorous discussion .",
    "it is known ( see pittel  @xcite ) that the giant component consists of its own 2-core and a _ mantle _ of trees , each sprouting from a different vertex of the 2-core . the proportion of vertices in the giant 2-core is a.a.s .",

    "one lands on the giant component .",
    "then the process of identification basically picks out the giant component ( and a few other smaller tree - like components which we may neglect because they are of size at most @xmath79 ) .",
    "thus , the proportion of identifiable vertices is @xmath80 which corresponds to the size of the giant component . as edges in cycles",
    "can not be essential , the essential edges in the giant component must almost all be found in the mantle . because the mantle is like a forest",

    "<S> we collapse the hypergraph by running the following algorithm to exhaustion : pick a vertex having a @xmath4-edge and remove it ; collapse the hyperedges over that vertex onto their remaining vertices ; repeat until there are no @xmath4-edges left . </S>",
    "<S> we call the vertices removed in this process _ identifiable_. also any hyperedge all of whose vertices are removed is called _ identifiable_. we say that a hyperedge is _ essential _ if its removal prior to collapse would have reduced the number of identifiable vertices . </S>",
    "<S> the limiting proportions , as @xmath5 , of identifiable vertices and hyperedges were obtained in @xcite . in this paper , we establish the limiting proportion of essential hyperedges </S>",
    "<S> . we also discuss , in the case of a random graph , the relation of essential edges to the 2-core of the graph , the maximal sub - graph with minimal vertex degree @xmath6 .    </S>",
