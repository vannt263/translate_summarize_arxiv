    "extended theories of gravity ( etgs ) are acquiring more and more interest in modern astrophysics and cosmology due to several inescapable issues and shortcomings that , in principle , could be addressed by revising or extending general relativity ( gr ) @xcite . in particular , observational and theoretical issues related to dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) could be encompassed in a new picture where gravitational interaction is depending on the scale of the self - gravitating systems without requiring further material ingredients @xcite that , up to now , seem extremely elusive ( see the recent results of the lux collaboration 2013 ) .",
    "in particular , one of the most famous observational issues which needs dm , in addition to the visible one , concerns dynamics of stellar objects in galaxies , a problem arising since the beginning @xcite . the disagreement between the observed and expected mass needed to explain dynamics soon revealed to be present even at cosmological scales @xcite . besides , the observed accelerating behavior of the hubble flow @xcite needs to be addressed at fundamental level either by revising the standard cosmological model or finding out cosmic fluids capable of giving rise to cosmic acceleration .",
    "it is however worth pointing out that the possibility to consider modifications of the newtonian dynamics should be taken into account not only when considering the coupling of matter and gravity field of each - other influencing distinct objects , but also in the case of self - gravitating systems .",
    "these can be of different types and sizes : collapsing molecular clouds , instability strip and main sequence stars , hyper - massive stars , and post - evolved very compact objects such as magnetars @xcite .",
    "in particular , exotic compact objects are not only matter of speculative theories but are gaining observational evidence of their presence @xcite and very often escape interpretation in the framework of standard newtonian theory . specifically , the structure and evolution of very massive stars is a key field of investigation for interpreting peculiar objects like gamma ray burst ( grb ) .",
    "the nature of progenitors could play a crucial role in determining the energetics and hydrodynamical processes related to the central engine in order to provide the observed enormous amount of @xmath1 erg of electromagnetic energies .",
    "suitable candidates for grb progenitors are thought to be wolf - rayet stars with hydrogen - stripped envelopes and masses of the helium core @xmath2 .",
    "additionally , numerical simulations claim for the possibility of pair - instability supernovae with @xmath3 as possible progenitor , if not for all , at least for a part of grbs @xcite .",
    "it is thus evident that addressing the problem of stellar stability over a wide range of masses and radii has important implications for several aspects of their pre- and post- evolutionary history .",
    "these theoretical issues can be considered valid both at descriptive and predictive level : from one side there is the need to explain the existence of objects which seem to have masses higher than their expected value ( _ i.e. _ volkoff magnetars ) ; from the other side , providing theoretically stable stellar models ( not yet observed ) can have important implications both for stellar evolution and for testing gravity . in particular , modified gravity theories may lead to extra branch of solutions for neutron stars as recently pointed out in @xcite .",
    "in general , the stability of stellar structures is strictly related to the hydrostatic equilibrium conditions .",
    "equations governing such equilibrium contain the gradient of the gravitational potentials and are , ultimately , related to the field equations governing the coupling between matter and gravitational field . in the newtonian theory ,",
    "if the thermodynamical relations of stellar structures are determined by a polytropic equation of state between pressure and density , the gravitational potential @xmath4 is determined through the well known lane - emden equation ( lee ) .",
    "the weak - field approximation in gr case leads to a generally non - linear second - order differential equation governing the behaviour of the gravitational potential over the polytropic stellar structure @xcite .",
    "however , when the hilbert - einstein action is modified considering a function @xmath0 of the ricci scalar , in particular , if we expand this function up to @xmath5 , the weak field equations lead to a system of coupled modified poisson equations between @xmath4 and the scalar curvature invariant @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this means , equivalently , that two gravitational potentials have to be considered being the field equations of fourth order @xcite .",
    "this system gives rise to a _ modified lane - emdem equation _",
    "( mlee ) for @xmath4 which contains an additional convolutional term related to the yukawa - like correction in the gravitational potential @xcite .",
    "the importance of this term depends on the interaction length - scale over which it acts .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider numerical solutions of mlee coming from @xmath0-gravity .",
    "we want to show that , beside standard stellar structures , coming from the newtonian limit of gr , other structures could be addressed .",
    "the eventual detection of such structures could constitute a formidable test for alternative theories of gravity , in particular for etgs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ due ] we review briefly how the mlee comes out in the context of @xmath0-gravity . in section [ sect_algorithm ] ,",
    "a description of the algorithm used to numerically integrate the mlee is given . in section [ results ]",
    "we show the numerical results for some values of polytropic index comparing them with gr results . in particular",
    ", we discuss the role of the yukawa - like correction coming out in the newtonian potential .",
    "stellar masses and gravitational energy binding are calculated in section [ cinque ] .",
    "finally , discussions and conclusions are drawn in section [ sei ] .",
    "the modified lane - emden equation ( mlee ) has been derived in the context of @xmath0-gravity , for self - gravitating systems in the linear approximation of weak field @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to that paper for the mathematical details and its derivation . here , we briefly report the the most relevant steps . + in the metric approach ,",

    "the affinities are the standard christoffel symbols @xmath16 .",
    "the adopted signature is @xmath17 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the field equations ( [ fieldequationhog ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the einstein tensor and @xmath20 is the curvature energy - momentum tensor that comes out when we introduce curvature higher order terms in the lagrangian @xcite .",

    "as we can see , in the right side of equation ( [ et ] ) , there are two fluids : a standard matter fluid and a curvature fluid . in this way we can treat even the etgs as the gr in the presence of two sources ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we recall that the energy momentum for a perfect fluid considered is the following @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the pressure and @xmath43 is the energy density of perfect fluid .",

    "+ here , using the above equation ( [ hoeq ] ) and after some calculations , we get the general form of the mlee which reads as @xmath59    where @xmath60 is a dimensionless radius given in units of the polytropic radius , which is defined as    @xmath61    the dimensionless function @xmath62 gives the gravitational potential normalized to its central value    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the central density , while @xmath50 and @xmath31 are the constant and the index of the polytropic equation of state    @xmath65    the quantity @xmath66 in the right - hand side of equation ( [ le_equation ] ) is related to the effective length scale of the yukawa - like correction term to the newtonian potential . defining @xmath67 ,",
    "we may write @xmath68 ; when @xmath69 , @xmath70 , the gravitational potential asymptotically becomes newtonian , and the right - hand side term of equation ( [ le_equation ] ) goes to zero , in turn recovering the gr case .",
    "it is well know that analytical solutions for the classical lane - emden equation exist only for three values of the polytropic index @xmath31 , equal to 0 , 1 and 5 , respectively . of these",
    ", only @xmath71 and @xmath72 give finite - radius solutions .",
    "the situation of course gets even more complicated in the case of mlee , for its full integro - differential nature in this case analytical solutions are available only for @xmath31=0 ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a systematic investigation of polytropic stellar structures thus requires the developement of numerical methods aimed at obtaining general solution of equation ( [ le_equation ] ) .",

    "[ le_equation ] ) at the nodes @xmath92 are computed by mean of a linear interpolation .    as we are interested in finding self - consistent solutions , which in turn correspond to determine the stellar radius of the polytropic star , it is worth pointing that @xmath95 is not given by hand as a free parameter , but at each iteration it is determined by the value of @xmath96 such that @xmath97 .",
    "in this way , the two input parameters required to derive a full solution of equaton ( [ le_equation ] ) are the polytropic index @xmath31 and the product @xmath98 . bearing in mind that @xmath99 and @xmath100 defines the characteristic scale of the yukawa - like correction to the newtonian potential , the quantity @xmath101 just expresses the yukawa lenght scale in units of the polytropic radius @xmath102 . the fastness in the convergence of the iteration procedure depends on the initial guess of the @xmath89 function , and we found that the setting @xmath103 provides convergence after just a few iterations",
    "the robustness of the solving algorithm described in section [ sect_algorithm ] allowed us the possibility to explore the solutions of the mlee for any value of the poliyropic index @xmath104 and the yukawa length scale @xmath105 and compare them with the case of gr .",

    "[ zmax_vs_lyuk ] . for clarity plotting purposes",
    "we show results for values of @xmath31 from 1 to 3 with stepsize of 0.5 . from the figure",
    "it can be seen that the deviations from the gr - values occur in a range @xmath112 , which does not approximatively depend on the politropic index @xmath31 .",
    "the region characterizing the deviations between gr and @xmath0 solutions has a sharp increase around @xmath113 , followed by a plateau and a subsequent fast transition to the classical solution at @xmath114 . for @xmath115",
    "the right hand part of the plateau also shows a secondary superposed increase of @xmath95 before the steep decay to the classical solution and specularly in the region around @xmath116 the value of @xmath95 is slightly lower than its gr - solution .",
    "it is also worth noting that in all cases @xmath117 , or @xmath118 , thus the yukawa correction term , no matter which is its true value in the considered region , acts on a characteristic length scale lower than the stellar radius .",

    "the most relevant result is that in @xmath0-gravity masses and associated gravitational energy binding values can exceed up to 50% of their classical value for @xmath146 .",
    "furthermore , we have two characteristic gravitational radii , the standard schwarzschild one @xmath147 where @xmath129 is defined by equation ( [ mass_wz ] ) and , as we have seen , a length related to the yukawa correction . keeping in mind the definition of @xmath102 , equation ( [ poly_radius ] ) , and defining @xmath148 , where @xmath149 and @xmath150",

    "this means that a second gravitational radius , acting on scales larger than the schwarzschild radius , can be defined . from a dynamical point of view , in principle , this fact can be interpreted as the possibility to stabilize more massive self - gravitating systems that can not be achieved in standard gr . in other words ,",
    "very massive exotic objects that could not be obtained as solutions of the standard theory of stellar structures could be achieved in the framework of @xmath0-gravity .",
    "the developement of an efficient algorithm aimed to solve the lane - emden equation for stellar structures in @xmath0-gravity allows to open unexplored possibilities for self - graviting systems and stellar structures . in particular , we have seen that higher - order gravitational corrections give the possibility to extend the range of stable stellar structures by inducing a further characteristic gravitational radius that , if compared with the schwarzschild one can rule these new structures .    in general , one can get more massive structures that remain stable .",
    "these toy - models have of course to be refined considering also values of physical interest for the costant @xmath50 of the polytropic relation , the central density @xmath142 and other secondary parameters .",
    "specifically , a further numerical step and refinement will consist in building up realistic stellar models where the structure is divided into a given number of shells , each with its own polytropic equation @xmath160 . for each @xmath75 shell",

    "this would be particularly desired for main sequence model with a central nuclear burning core surrounded by a convective envelope .",
    "besides , the algorithm could work also to describe structures out of the main sequence , peculiar objects and systems in the instability strip since boundary conditions on the mlee are less restrictive with respect to those requested for standard lee .",
    "finally , as discussed in @xcite , in the case of observation of self - gravitating systems that escape standard description of gr , this could constitute a straightforward testbed for alternative theories of gravity .",
