    "@xcite implications of channelling have been discussed in terms of a specific modelling of this effect for the case of the dama nai(tl ) detector ; it is shown that the occurrence of channelling makes the response of this detector to wimp - nucleus interactions more sensitive than in the case in which channelling is not included .",
    "therefore , when applied to a wimp with a coherent interaction with nuclei , the inclusion of the channelling effect implies that the annual modulation region , in the plane of the wimp - nucleon cross section versus the wimp mass , is considerably modified as compared to the one derived without including channelling .",

    "more specifically we examine the properties of our supersymmetric population of light relic neutralinos in terms of the possible antimatter components generated by their pair annihilation in the galactic halo .",

    "they represent regions where the likelihood - function values differ more than 4@xmath2 from the null hypothesis ( absence of modulation ) @xcite .",
    "the scatter plot is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig:00 ] .",
    "it is remarkable that light neutralinos are able to provide a good fit to the experimental data .",
    "this occurs for values of @xmath11 and @xmath28 which are in the low - medium side of their own physical ranges , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath29 ( 170  220 ) km sec@xmath15 and @xmath30 gev @xmath20 . the light neutralinos involved in this fit stay in the mass range @xmath31 gev .",
    "we remark that in case the channelling is not included , the dama regions would be sizeably displaced as compared to the ones displayed in fig .",
    "2 , similarly to what is shown in fig .",
    "an example of the effect of including channelling in the determination of the annual modulation region , when the a1 model for the df is taken , is explicitly displayed in fig . 7 of ref . [ 1 ] . as already remarked before , in connection with fig .",
    "1 , for wimp masses @xmath32 30 gev , the wimp - nucleon cross section involved in the annual modulation effect decreases sizeably , when channeling is included , up to more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this implies that , not including channelling , the fit of the experimental data with light neutralinos would require values of @xmath28 ( @xmath33 gev @xmath20 ) higher than the ones previously derived . also @xmath11 would be in the high side of its physical range .",
    "these properties are of relevance for the implications which will follow .",
    "when the channelling effect is taken into account and no rotation of the halo is considered , it turns out @xcite that the features of the annual modulation region in the @xmath34 plane do not differ much when the galactic df is varied , for many of the galactic dfs considered in ref .",

    "@xcite ) or for an isothermal model with a non - isotropic velocity dispersion ( b1 model of ref .",
    "@xcite ) the physical situation is very similar to the one depicted in fig .",

    "further insight into the properties of light neutralinos are expected from the future results of the dama / libra experiment @xcite .",
    "we wish also to stress that the distribution of wimps in the galaxy could deviate from the models mentioned above , mainly because of the presence of streams . for modification of the annual modulation region in these instances",
    "see ref.@xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in the numerical derivation given above , also uncertainties of other origin may intervene .",
    "suffice it to mention that the sizeable uncertainties which affect strength of the coupling of the neutralino to the nucleon @xcite .    in this paper , among the searches for wimp direct detection",
    "we discuss only the dama / nai experiment , since this is the only experiment having at present the capability to measure the annual modulation effect , which is a distinctive feature for discriminating the signal against the background in a wimp direct search @xcite . for updated reviews about other experiments of wimp direct detection ,",
    "see ref . @xcite .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , among the various searches for indirect signals due to annihilation of light wimps , the cosmic rays antiprotons provide the most significant constraints . for this reason",
    "we now examine how this kind of limits applies to the light neutralinos singled out by the dama / nai annual modulation regions .",
    "so - called secondary antiprotons are produced in the galaxy via interaction of proton and helium cosmic rays with the interstellar hydrogen and helium nuclei .",
    "a thorough calculation of the secondary antiproton spectrum has been performed in ref.@xcite , where the antiprotons generated by spallation processes are propagated using a two  zone diffusion model described in terms of five parameters .",

    "[ fig:02 ] shows that , for values of the diffusion parameters close to the minimal set , present antiprotons data do not set constraints . for values of the diffusion parameters around the median set , we have that : in case a , most of the neutralino configurations with @xmath47 and a few with @xmath0 remain unconstrained ; in cases b and c only subsets of neutralinos with @xmath47 survive .",
    "when the diffusion parameters approach the values of the maximal set , only very few susy configurations survive in case a. from fig .",

    "we have proved that these annual modulation data are fitted by light neutralinos which arise naturally in supersymmetric models where gaugino mass parameters are not related by the a gut  scale unification condition .",
    "the precise range of the neutralino mass which fits the annual modulation data depends on how the wimp galactic distribution function is modelled and on a number of other assumptions , such as those mentioned in sect .",

    "we have then shown that the populations of light neutralinos selected by the annual modulation regions are consistent with present data on galactic antiprotons . we have also derived the intervals of the diffusion parameters which provide this agreement in correlation with the specific galactic halo model . for instance , for neutralinos with a mass of 20 gev and a cored isothermal model with @xmath18 km s@xmath15 we have @xmath50 and @xmath51 kpc when @xmath52 gev @xmath20 ; instead when @xmath53 gev @xmath20 , @xmath41 may go up to 15 kpc with a range of @xmath36 which progressively shrinks to @xmath54 , when @xmath41 increases .    we have also shown that future measurements of galactic antiprotons and antideuterons will offer , together with the upcoming data from dama / libra , very interesting perspectives for further investigating the light neutralino populations selected by the annual modulation data . in case of models with a corotating halo or with triaxial spatial distributions , not investigated in the present paper , also heavier neutralinos can be involved .",
    "finally , a word of caution should be said concerning the fact that the distribution of wimps in the galaxy could deviate from the models mentioned above , mainly because of the presence of streams and/or clumpiness . in such instances ,",

    "<S> the dama collaboration has recently analyzed its data of the extensive wimp direct search ( dama / nai ) which detected an annual modulation , by taking into account the channelling effect which occurs when an ion traverses a detector with a crystalline structure . among possible implications , </S>",
    "<S> this collaboration has considered the case of a coherent wimp - nucleus interaction and then derived the form of the annual modulation region in the plane of the wimp - nucleon cross section versus the wimp mass , using a specific modelling for the channelling effect . in the present paper we first show that light neutralinos fit the annual modulation region also when channelling is taken into account . to discuss the connection with indirect signals consisting in galactic antimatter , in our analysis we pick up a specific galactic model , the cored isothermal - sphere . in this scheme </S>",
    "<S> we determine the sets of supersymmetric models selected by the annual modulation regions and then prove that these sets are compatible with the available data on galactic antiprotons . </S>",
    "<S> we comment on implications when other galactic distribution functions are employed . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that future measurements on galactic antiprotons and antideuterons will be able to shed further light on the populations of light neutralinos singled out by the annual modulation data . </S>"
