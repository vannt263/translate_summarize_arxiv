    "since the pioneering work of oppenheimer and snyder@xcite the final state of a star undergoing gravitational collapse has occupied a significant standing in relativistic astrophysics . an interesting extension of this problem is to include heat flow to a spherically symmetric model as a realistic model of a radiating star in gravitational collapse .",
