    "lorentz- and cpt - violating theories in @xmath0-dimensions have been object of intensive investigation in the latest years @xcite-@xcite . an odd - cpt lorentz - violating model ( with a chern - simons - like term )",
    "was pioneering considered in the context of classical electrodynamics by carroll - field - jackiw @xcite , by setting up a simple way to realize the cpt- and lorentz - breakings in the framework of the maxwell theory . in a general perspective , an extension of the minimal @xmath1 standard model incorporating odd- and even - ctp terms was developed by colladay  & kostelecky @xcite as a low - energy limit of a lorentz covariant model valid at the planck scale .",
    "this master model undergoes a spontaneous symmetry breaking , generating an effective action that incorporates lorentz violation and keeps unaffected the @xmath1 gauge structure and the energy - momentum conservation .",
    "this standard model extension ( sme )  has then been investigated under diverse aspects @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the carroll - field - jackiw model@xcite , in spite of predicting several interesting new properties and a potentially rich phenomenology , is a model plagued with some serious problems , like the absence of stability and causality in the case of a purely timelike background , @xmath2v@xmath3 even so , this theory has been fairly - well discussed under a number of different aspects , like the following ones : ( i ) the birefringence ( optical activity of the vacuum ) , induced by the fixed background @xcite,@xcite , ( ii ) the investigation of radiative corrections @xcite , ( iii ) the consideration of spontaneous breaking of u(1)-symmetry in this framework @xcite , ( iv ) the search for a supersymmetric lorentz - violating extension model @xcite , ( v ) the study of vacuum cerenkov radiation @xcite , photon decay process @xcite , and some other points .",
    "the great interest aroused by such an issue has motivated the study of lorentz - violating theories in lower dimensions . in this sense ,",
    "a dimensional reduction ( to @xmath4 of the lorentz - breaking maxwell electrodynamics , endowed with the carroll - field - jackiw term ( @xmath5 ) @xcite , has been recently performed @xcite , yielding in a gauge invariant planar quantum electrodynamics ( qed@xmath6 ) composed by a maxwell - chern - simons gauge sector , a klein - gordon massless scalar field @xmath7 , and the fixed 3-vector @xmath8 , responsible for the lorentz - violation . as for the physical consistency of this model ,",
    "some of its general features have been investigated .",
    "one has then verified that the complete model is stable and preserves causality and unitarity without any restrictions @xcite .",
    "therefore , the full model supports a consistent quantization for both time- and spacelike backgrounds .",
    "furthermore , the classical motion equations and solutions of this lorentz - violating planar model were considered as well @xcite , revealing interesting deviations in relation to the pure mcs case , like the absence of screening in the electric sector for a purely timelike background and manifest anisotropy for a purely spacelike background .",
    "the carroll - field - jackiw model has been also considered in the context of a @xmath9 spontaneous symmetry breaking , yielding an abelian - higgs lorentz - violating model in ( 1 + 3 ) dimensions endowed with stable vortex configurations @xcite . in a further work @xcite ,",
    "one has carried out the dimensional reduction of this master model to ( 1 + 2 ) dimensions , obtaining a planar lorentz - violating lagrangian with the higgs sector .",
    "the consistency of this model was properly analyzed at the classical level , revealing preservation of causality , stability and unitarity for both time- and spacelike backgrounds , in a similar way to the case addressed to in ref .",
    "recently , one has also investigated the presence of vortex configurations in this planar framework @xcite , and it has been found out that there may appear stable configurations of electrically charged vortices which induce an aharonov - casher phase for  neutral particles .    to study lorentz - violating theories ,",
    "we have adopted a general procedure that consists in investigating and setting up its classical aspects before addressing to the second - quantized case . with this program in mind , we have discussed the consistency ( causality , unitarity and stability ) of the higgs - carroll - field - jackiw model both in ( 1 + 3 ) and ( 1 + 2 ) dimensions , based on the dispersion relations that are read off as poles of the propagators .",
    "this task may indeed indicate the eventual presence of non - physical modes , such as spacelike poles ( tachyons ) and negative - norm 1-particle states ( ghosts ) .",
    "once one has thereby fixed the parameters of the model and selected the situations for which the spectrum does not display unphysical excitations , then it is sensible to carry out the second quantization of the system .    in the present paper ,",
    "one follows this general procedure , now focusing the attention on the classical electrodynamics that stems from the u(1 ) broken phase of the planar version of the abelian higgs cfj model .",
    "the main goal is to describe the influence of the lorentz - violating background on the solutions associated with a system of point - like charges , bearing in mind the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , which revealed the possibility of having new physics induced by the presence of the background ( as the vanishing of the screening associated with the mcs electrodynamics , for instance ) . in this sense ,",
    "one first writes down the tree - level lagrangian of the u(1 ) broken phase of the higgs - abelian model worked out in ref .",
    "@xcite ; it is composed of a mcs - proca gauge sector coupled to a klein - gordon massive field by means of the lorentz - violating term .",
    "the associated classical equations of motion ( the extended maxwell equations ) and wave equations ( for the potential @xmath10 ) are written in the sequel .",
    "such equations correspond to the ones of the usual mcs - proca electrodynamics supplemented by terms that depend on the background vector .",
    "so , it might be expected that the solutions we find correspond to the mcs - proca ones corrected by background - dependent terms .",
    "indeed , this is the case .",
    "proceeding further , solutions for field strengths and potentials have been found for point - like charges ( both for purely timelike and spacelike backgrounds ) , exhibiting @xmath11-dependent corrections with respect to the pure mcs - proca counterparts .",
    "specifically , in the case of a purely timelike background , exact algebraic solutions are attained by means of fourier integrations .",
    "both the scalar and vector potentials are given in terms of linear combinations of modified bessel functions @xmath12 and behave at the origin and far from it in much the same way as the pure mcs - proca solutions ; the difference always occurs at some intermediary radial region .",
    "since these bessel functions decay exponentially , it is evident that the associated solutions present a strong screening , typical to the case where the physical intermediation is played only by massive particles .",
    "it has also been noticed that the scalar potential @xmath13 exhibits a familiar form , similar to the mcs - proca solution .",
    "however , it may significantly differ from the latter potential in the case of a small proca mass @xmath14 or a large background @xmath15 in which case it becomes attractive in some radial range . as for the vector potential @xmath16one is able to write down a solution rather similar to the mcs - proca counterpart , without qualitative alterations . however , these solutions may differ substantially at intermediary distances for the case in which @xmath17 .",
    "plots are introduced to illustrate the points alluded to here .",
    "on  the other hand , in the case of a purely spacelike background , the fourier integrations result to be no more exactly soluble , implying the necessity of employing approximations which lead to algebraic solutions of great complexity ( in leading order in v@xmath18 ) .",
    "the presence of spatial - anisotropy becomes a manifest property , in the form of correction terms with a clear dependence on the angle determined by the fixed background ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the scalar potential worked out consists of a complex combination of bessel and radial functions @xmath20 ; its forms near and far from the origin are qualitatively similar to the mcs - proca case : it vanishes for @xmath21 and goes as @xmath22 for @xmath23 . concerning the vector potential",
    ", it also appears as a lengthy combination of bessel and radial functions @xmath24 exhibiting anisotropy terms . in spite of the involved complexity ,",
    "this potential presents an identical behavior to the mcs - proca counterpart near and away from the origin . a graphical analysis",
    "reveal that the presence of the background does not amount to qualitative or sensitive modifications on the the mcs - proca solutions , since the small magnitude of the background compared with the chern - simons parameters ( v@xmath25 .",
    "the method of investigation adopted here has yielded solutions for the klein - gordon field as well , revealing an analogous structure to the scalar potential both in the purely timelike and spacelike backgrounds .",
    "moreover , it is important to point out that such solutions recover the pure mcs - proca results in limit of a vanishing background @xmath26 which is a necessary condition to attest the validity of the solutions found out .    in short ,",

    "vi , we conclude by presenting our final remarks .",

    "the higgs field is not  considered in the lagrangian above once we work in the u(1 ) broken phase and the unitary gauge has been chosen ; as a consequence , this field has its own kinetic term and does not mix , as far as only bilinear terms are considered , with the gauge - field part of the action .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the field propagators related to lagrangian ( [ lagrange3 ] ) were properly evaluated and taken as starting point to analyze the consistency of this planar model , which has revealed to be totally causal and unitary for both timelike and spacelike backgrounds .",
