    "<S> introduction symmetric unions ( see section [ s2 ] for definitions ) were first introduced by kinoshita and terasaka in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> christoph lamm began a systematic investigation in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the main questions which motivate the study of symmetric unions is the following .    </S>",
    "<S> [ mainquestion ] does every ribbon knot admit a symmetric union presentation ?    </S>",
    "<S> in @xcite it is shown that all ribbon knots up to ten crossings have a symmetric union presentation . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the result is extended to all 2-bridge ribbon knots . in @xcite eisermann and </S>",
    "<S> lamm introduced a natural notion of _ symmetric equivalence _ between symmetric union presentations providing a list of symmetric reidemeister - like moves . </S>",
    "<S> this notion is further investigated in @xcite where a refined version of the jones polynomial is adapted to this setting .    </S>",
    "<S> one way to measure the complexity of a given ribbon knot @xmath6 is to consider its _ ribbon number _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 which is the minimal number of ribbon singularities among all ribbon disks spanning @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> every symmetric union presentation has an obvious symmetric ribbon disk associated with it , therefore it makes sense to define the _ symmetric ribbon number _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 of a given ribbon knot @xmath6 . set @xmath8 if @xmath6 does not admit a symmetric union presentation . </S>",
    "<S> keeping question [ mainquestion ] in mind it is natural to compare the ribbon number and its symmetric version for a given knot . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the complexity of a symmetric union presentation ( as measured by the symmetric ribbon number ) can be arbitrarly large even for knots with @xmath9 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ maintheorem ] for each positive integer @xmath10 there exists a ribbon knot @xmath3 such that @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> we do not know if any of the ribbon knots in the family @xmath11 admits a symmetric union presentation and we suspect that many of them do not . </S>",
    "<S> these knots are constructed as satellites of the simplest non trivial ribbon knot , i.e. the connected sum of a trefoil knot with its mirror image . the proof is based on the fact that for any ribbon knot @xmath12 gives un upper bound for the heegaard genus of the branched double cover along @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that there is a similar inequality involving the _ free genus _ of @xmath6 .    in section [ s2 ] </S>",
    "<S> we briefly review basic properties of symmetric unions and we establish the inequalities we need . in section [ s3 ] </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the family @xmath11 and give an estimate for the heegaard genus of their branched double covers which is needed to complete the proof of theorem [ maintheorem ] .    </S>",
    "<S> symmetric unions , branched double covers and the free genus[s2 ] a _ symmetric union presentation _ of a knot is a diagram obtained in the following way . </S>",
    "<S> we start with the symmetric diagram of a connected sum between a knot and its mirror image , and then we add crossings on the axis of symmetry </S>",
    "<S> . see figure [ ex ] for some examples taken from @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> see also @xcite for a formal definition .    </S>",
    "<S> the obvious reflection will fix the knot except near crossings on the axis which are necessarly reversed . </S>",
    "<S> more generally one can talk about symmetric diagrams , these will represents links that bounds ribbon surfaces consisting of annuli , mobius strips and disks . </S>",
    "<S> each symmetric union diagram describes an obvious ribbon disk spanning the given knot , see figure [ simdisk ] for an example .        </S>",
    "<S> this disk is obtained by joining symmetric points with a straight line ( see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we call such disks _ symmetric ribbon disks_. recall from @xcite that every ribbon disk ( and more generally every ribbon surface ) in @xmath13 admit a diagram , called a _ band diagram _ , made up from the elementary pieces shown in figure [ banddiagrams ] .             </S>",
    "<S> the second picture represents a _ </S>",
    "<S> junction_. the third picture represents a _ band crossing _ and the fourth one a ribbon singularity . </S>",
    "<S> our first observation is that symmetric ribbon disks admit a nice combinatorial characterization in terms of band diagrams .    </S>",
    "<S> [ keybservation ] every symmetric ribbon disk admits a band diagram without any band crossings nor junctions . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , every ribbon disk that has a band diagram without band crossings or junctions is a symmetric ribbon disk .    </S>",
    "<S> first note that each crossing on the axis corresponds to a half twist of a band which is a portion of the symmetric ribbon disk . as a first step we momentarily remove all these twists by smoothing crossings on the axis as shown in figure [ smooth ] .        </S>",
    "<S> recall that the disk is obtained by joining symmetric points with a straight line orthogonal to the symmetry plane . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the projection of the disk onto the symmetry plane consists of an arc with selfintersections ( double points ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example by projecting the symmetric ribbon disk in figure [ simdisk ] on its symmetry plane we get the curve in figure [ selfint ] .        </S>",
    "<S> each smooth point on this curve corresponds to a properly embedded interval in the ribbon disk while double points correspond to ribbon singularities . </S>",
    "<S> the desired band diagram may be obtained by slightly perturbing this projection as follows . </S>",
    "<S> first we modify the projection in a neighbourhood of each double point as shown in figure [ perturbing ] .        </S>",
    "<S> the perturbation is obtained by rotating each band on its core , this may be done in two different ways which correspond to the two rows in figure [ perturbing ] . </S>",
    "<S> now we slightly perturb the rest of the projection which appears as a collection of arcs . </S>",
    "<S> each arc will appear as a band after a rotation on its core . </S>",
    "<S> finally note that all these local choices for the rotation of bands can produce band twists . </S>",
    "<S> specifically twists will arise each time two adiacent bands are rotated in opposite directions .    </S>",
    "<S> now the original crossings on the axis can be restored . </S>",
    "<S> each crossing on the axis correspond to a half twist of a band of the ribbon disk . </S>",
    "<S> this band may be located in the projection we just obtained and the half twist can be reinserted . </S>",
    "<S> the band diagram obtained in this way has no band crossings and no junctions .    </S>",
    "<S> conversely suppose we are given a band diagram of a ribbon disk without band crossings and without junctions . </S>",
    "<S> near each ribbon singularity we may change the projection to obtain a pair of arcs intersecting trasversely in a single point ( see figure [ perturbing ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we may do the same for the bands connecting these ribbon singularities . </S>",
    "<S> each band will look like an arc outside small regions corresponding to band twists . near each ribbon singularity </S>",
    "<S> we may choose a plane parallel to the projection plane that cuts each band along its core . </S>",
    "<S> we may assume that all these planes coincide because all ribbon singularities are connected by band in planar fashion . </S>",
    "<S> we may also assume that the plane cuts each band connecting two ribbon singularities along its core ( except near band twists ) . </S>",
    "<S> all these adjustments may be carried out without altering our projection . </S>",
    "<S> note that the reflection across this plane fixes the knot except near the band twists . </S>",
    "<S> a symmetric union diagram can be obtained by projecting the knot onto any plane orthogonal to symmetry plane .    </S>",
    "<S> [ re ] the band diagram obtained in the above proof has the same number of ribbon singularities as the original symmetric ribbon disk .    </S>",
    "<S> [ rebis ] proposition [ keybservation ] holds in the more general context of symmetric diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> every symmetric link bounds a ribbon surface consisting of disks , annuli and mobius bands . </S>",
    "<S> a suitable projection can be chosen so that this surface can be described via a band diagram without band crossings and without junctions . </S>",
    "<S> the proof is the same as that of proposition [ keybservation ] .    </S>",
    "<S> before we explore some consequences of proposition [ keybservation ] we introduce some notation . </S>",
    "<S> given a knot @xmath6 we indicate by @xmath14 the _ free genus _ of @xmath6 , i.e. the minimal genus among all seifert surfaces spanning @xmath6 whose complement have free fundamental group ( these are sometimes called _ regular _ seifert surfaces ) . </S>",
    "<S> we denote by @xmath15 the branched double cover of @xmath13 branched along @xmath6 . finally for any closed orientable 3-manifold @xmath16 we denote by @xmath17 its heegaard genus .    </S>",
    "<S> [ inequalities ] let @xmath6 be a ribbon knot , and let @xmath18 be a symmetric ribbon disk which minimizes the number of ribbon singularities .    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 has free fundamental group and its rank equals @xmath0 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21    the first assertion is clear from the proof of proposition [ keybservation ] and remark [ re ] .     </S>",
    "<S> that lifts to a heegaard decomposition of @xmath15 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> choose a band diagram for @xmath18 without band crossings and without junctions . </S>",
    "<S> we can enclose each ribbon singularity in a ball whose boundary intersects the knot in exactly eight points . </S>",
    "<S> now we can connect these balls with unknotted tubes disjoint from @xmath18 , in this way we obtain a decomposition of @xmath13 into two balls @xmath22 and @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> each pair @xmath24 is homeomorphic to the standard ball containing a trivial braid , therefore this decomposition lifts to a heegaard decomposition for @xmath15 of genus @xmath25 ( see figure [ exbis ] for an example ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inequality follows .    </S>",
    "<S> let us fix again a band diagram for @xmath18 without band crossings and without junctions and an orientation for @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> near each ribbon singularity there are four possible oriented configurations as shown in figure [ orientedconfigurations ] .        by flipping the horizontal band if necessary </S>",
    "<S> we may assume that only the first two cases occur . </S>",
    "<S> now assume , momentarly , that there are no band twists in our diagram . </S>",
    "<S> in this situation the seifert algorithm will produce a regular seifert surface @xmath26 whose genus is precisely @xmath0 . to see this note that near each ribbon singularity the oriented resolution gives four arcs corresponding to the four bands connected to the ribbon singularity . </S>",
    "<S> all but two of the seifert circles will appear as an arc on two ribbon singularities ( once these are appropriately resolved ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the number of seifert circles of @xmath26 is @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the euler characteristic is @xmath28 from which we obtain @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to check that band twists do not alter the computation we made above because they do not change the seifert graph associated to @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> the family @xmath11[s3 ] in this section we will construct an infinite family of ribbon knots @xmath11 such that @xmath4 and @xmath30 . this fact together with the second assertion of proposition [ inequalities ] will conclude the proof o[lemma]f theorem [ maintheorem ] . the idea is to start with a very simple ribbon knot and then replace a piece of unknotted band with a knotted one , this operation will change the knot and its ribbon disk without changing its ribbon number . see figure [ ribsat ] for an example .    </S>",
    "<S> first we recall some basic terminology and facts from @xcite . by a _ </S>",
    "<S> tangle _ </S>",
    "<S> we mean a pair @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a 3-ball and @xmath33 is a pair of properly embedded arcs in @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> two tangles @xmath34 are _ equivalent _ if there is an homeomorphism of pairs from @xmath31 to @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> a tangle is said to be _ untangled _ is it is equivalent to the trivial tangle ( these are usually called _ rational _ tangles ) . </S>",
    "<S> a tangle is _ locally unknotted _ if every 2-sphere which meets @xmath33 transversely in two points bounds a ball which meets @xmath33 in an unknotted arc . </S>",
    "<S> finally a locally unknotted tangle which is not untangled is said to be _ </S>",
    "<S> prime_. given two tangles @xmath31 , @xmath35 and a homeomorphism @xmath36 a link can be obtained by identifying the boundaries of the two tangles via @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> we say that such a link is obtained as the _ sum of the tangles _ @xmath31 and @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> we will also need the notion of _ partial sum _ between tangles . </S>",
    "<S> this operation consists in identifying a @xmath38 pair in the boundary of a tangle with a similar pair in the boundary of another tangle so that the result is still a tangle .    </S>",
    "<S> [ lick]@xcite let @xmath31 be a prime tangle . </S>",
    "<S> its branched double cover @xmath16 is irreducible and its boundary @xmath39 is incompressible .    </S>",
    "<S> we recall from @xcite the following theorem .    </S>",
    "<S> [ bound ] there exists a constant @xmath40 such that for every closed , orientable and irreducible 3-manifold @xmath41 of heegaard genus @xmath42 and every collection @xmath43 , @xmath44 of disjoint incompressible tori in @xmath41 at least two of them @xmath45 and @xmath46 are parallel .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath47 and @xmath48 be the tangles depicted in figure [ tangles ] . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath3 be the knot obtained as an iterated partial sum of the tangle @xmath47 and @xmath10 copies of the tangle @xmath48 as depicted in figure [ ribsat ] .    as is clear from the picture each @xmath3 is a nontrivial knot bounding a ribbon disk with two ribbon singularities . </S>",
    "<S> moreover it is easy to show that every ribbon disk with less than two ribbon singularities is bounded by the trivial knot ( for these and other considerations on the ribbon number see for instance @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that @xmath4 for each @xmath49 .        for each positive integer @xmath50 </S>",
    "<S> there exists @xmath51 such that @xmath52    it is shown in @xcite that the tangles @xmath47 and @xmath48 are prime and that summing prime tangles gives prime knots . </S>",
    "<S> by @xcite a link in @xmath13 is prime if and only if its branched double cover is irreducible . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that each @xmath53 is an irreducible 3-manifold .    . </S>",
    "<S> each sphere lifts to an incompressible torus in the branched double cover ]    by theorem [ lick ] each sphere depicted in figure [ ribsat ] lifts to an incompressible torus in @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath10 disjoint incompressible tori , in order to apply theorem [ bound ] we only need to show that these tori are pairwise non parallel . </S>",
    "<S> choose a pair of tori and assume by contradiction that they are parallel . </S>",
    "<S> by dehn filling each boundary component we would obtain a lens space . </S>",
    "<S> this filling may be chosen so that it corresponds to the sum of trivial tangles in @xmath13 which gives a cable of a connected sum of trefoil knots . </S>",
    "<S> since this knot is not a 2-bridge knot its branched double cover can not be a lens space . </S>"
