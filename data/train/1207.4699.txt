    "the rapid development of high precision techniques for the experimental control of ultracold quantum gases offers a clean way to study static and dynamical properties of interacting many - body lattice systems @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are realizations of strongly correlated or complex quantum systems composed of many particles .",
    "experiments controlling the populations of higher orbitals and bands in periodic potentials are now at hand @xcite .",
    "this facilitates the study of many degree - of - freedom systems . moreover , many - body quantum quenches , non - equilibrium dynamics and real - time controlled sweep dynamics can be realized in the experiments @xcite .",
    "this offers very good advantages for a better understanding of the underlying diffusion processes taking place not only in real space , but , more generally , in the hilbert space @xcite . in this latter context ,",
    "aspects of integrability of quantum systems are crucial for predictions on , for instance , their relaxation dynamics and further thermalization @xcite .    in this paper we present a case study of a complex many - body system including two strongly coupled energy bands . as we sketch in sec .",

    "our system represents a paradigm for the many - body physics , in which the dynamics can be steered by the parameters ( tilt , interaction strength , potential depth ) , thus implementing very different dynamics .",
    "while the mean - field transport ( weakly interacting limit ) and the single particle limit are well studied for one - dimensional wannier - stark systems @xcite , even the simplest many body version , a one - band bose - hubbard model with(out ) tilt , allows one to tune between regular and quantum chaotic evolutions @xcite . in our problem , depending on the choice of parameters , full complexity in the interband transport in hilbert space can be reached by sweeping predetermined initial states over resonant tunneling regions .",
    "this is possible since the strongest interband coupling occurs at resonantly enhanced tunneling ( ret ) between energy bands @xcite . at resonant conditions ,",
    "we find a clear crossover from regular to quantum chaotic spectral statistics as a function of a few system parameters .",
    "the complexity in the energy spectrum determines the transport across the many avoided crossings at ret when the force becomes time - dependent .",
    "this not only generalizes results on the weakly interacting limit @xcite , but relates to the largely open problem of many - body landau - zener processes in the presence of strong particle interactions @xcite . as direct applications",
    "we show how the spectral properties influence the diffusion in hilbert space .",
    "we characterize different realistic scenarios for which relaxation toward equilibrium and spectral localization on the one hand and diffusion on the other hand take place .",
