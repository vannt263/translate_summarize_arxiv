    "owing to its extraordinary properties  @xcite , graphene has already been implemented in various kinds of applications / devices  @xcite and led to the emergence of a new class of materials ; ultra - thin two - dimensional crystal structures .",
    "nowadays , among the members of this new era , especially the ultra - thin transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) have attracted considerable interest.@xcite even though , they are only few - atom - thick , mx@xmath3-type structures have remarkable chemical and mechanical stability@xcite and offer new physics as various quantum confinement effects amplified in quasi - two dimension @xcite . as a result of this confinement effect , the band gap increases and transforms to a direct band gap with decreasing number of layers which makes them promising candidates for nanoscale field - effect transistors and for solar cell applications.@xcite recently , possibility of vacancy creation in tmds under electron irradiation,@xcite bandgap transition in tungsten dichalcogenides@xcite , existence of tightly bound negative",

    "we find that the @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes are almost degenerate for bulk wse@xmath2 whereas these modes are well separated for other members ( mos@xmath3 , mose@xmath3 and ws@xmath3 ) of the tmds .",
    "interestingly , this degeneracy is lifted as the dimensionality is lowered from 3d ( bulk limit ) to 2d ( monolayer ) where the @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes are separated by @xmath412 @xmath5 .",
    "calculated vibrational spectrum show that the lifting the degeneracy is closely related to the uniaxial strain induced on monolayer wse@xmath2 due to interaction with the substrate and/or sample preparation procedure .",
    "lastly , we show that the band gap of wse@xmath2 goes through rather soft indirect to direct band gap crossover from bulk to monolayer and the band gap shows almost triple band degeneracy for bi and tri - layers as evidenced by our photoluminescence measurements .",

    "the thickness of the wse@xmath2 flakes was confirmed by three complementary methods , atomic force microscopy ( afm ) , raman spectroscopy , and photoluminescence ( pl ) .",

    "phonon frequencies and phonon eigenvectors were calculated by using both the density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt)@xcite and the small displacement method.@xcite",
    "similar to graphite , wse@xmath3 crystals possess lamellar structure with bernal stacking where the individual layers are weakly coupled to the adjacent layers by van der waals ( vdw ) forces . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a - b ) , each monolayer wse@xmath3 ( 1h - wse@xmath2 ) consists of se - w - se atoms wherein tungsten atoms are sandwiched between trigonally arranged sheets of selenium atoms .",
    "our calculations reveal that bulk wse@xmath3 has an 1.21 ev indirect band gap where the valence band maximum ( vbm ) is located both at the k symmetry point while the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) is along the @xmath8-k direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) green - dashed curve ) .",
    "we note that conduction bands located at k and @xmath8-k is only separated by 0.04 ev in energy and hence we expect that its electronic properties will be strain and dimensionality dependent as a result of significant changes in the hybridization .",
    "since bulk wse@xmath2 is an indirect band gap semiconductor , the photoluminescence signal is expected to be rather weak for bulk wse@xmath3 as observed in fig .",

    "we see that in contrast to the general case , for wse@xmath2 , lda and gga band dispersions differ significantly .",
    "while gga finds single layer wse@xmath2 as a semiconductor with a direct bandgap of 1.56 ev , lda gives indirect bandgap of 1.68 ev .",
    "here , both lda and gga finds vbm at the k symmetry point and cbm is located at k ( in between @xmath8 and k ) point in gga ( lda ) .",
    "it appears that the gga exchange correlation better approximates the ground state characteristics of the wse@xmath2 crystal structure .",
    "here it is also worth to note that spin - orbit interaction results in two significant effects on the electronic band dispersion : ( i ) shifting down the valence band energies at the @xmath8 point ( ii ) band splitting at the vicinity of k and m symmetry points . clearly , the existence of an intrinsic electric field breaks the inversion symmetry in the crystal structure .",
    "therefore , it is seen that the degeneracy of the doubly degenerate valence and conduction bands of single layer wse@xmath2 are removed by spin - orbit interaction and a band splitting occurs .",
    "furthermore , when the spin - orbit interaction is taken into account in our calculations , conduction band edges at k and k-@xmath8 points show band splitting that allows various direct and indirect transitions ( even in few - layered wse@xmath2 structures ) . in our study",

    ", bilayer wse@xmath2 possesses almost triple band gap degeneracy where the k@xmath9k and k@xmath9@xmath8-k gap values are almost degenerate and the difference between first and second cbms is @xmath10(k)=40 mev which is close to thermal broadening ( @xmath430mev ) . as a result of this band degeneracy , the integrated pl intensity ( fig .",

    "we use raman spectroscopy which is one of the most useful non - destructive technique for the characterization of low - dimensional materials .",
    "our measurements reveal that the most prominent raman peak for bulk wse@xmath2 is located at 252.2 @xmath5 ( fig .",

    "interestingly , for flakes thinner than four layers , an additional peak appears at roughly 5 - 11 @xmath5 above the first order raman peak .",

    "similar to the mos@xmath3 and mose@xmath3 counterparts,@xcite the unitcell of bulk wse@xmath2 has eighteen phonon branches corresponding to six acoustic and twelve optical phonon modes . while the modes at @xmath4170 ( @xmath4300 ) @xmath5 are 4-fold ( 2-fold ) degenerate , six modes become almost degenerate at @xmath4250 @xmath5 at the @xmath8 point . for a better understanding of the phonon spectrum and the prominent peak in the measurement",

    "[ fig2](b ) and ( c ) .",

    "only the e@xmath15 mode is raman - active .",
    "however , in backscattering experiments on a surface perpendicular to the c - axis , the e@xmath15 mode is forbidden and is not observed in our experiments .",
    "furthermore , the decomposition of the six - fold phonon branch at @xmath4250 @xmath5 ( at @xmath8 point ) can be described as @xmath21 . among these the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes",
    "are raman - active and are degenerate in energy . as a result of this degeneracy",
    ", only one raman peak can be observed in our measurements at 250 @xmath5 .",
    "next , we pay attention to the emergence of the second raman peak in few and single layer wse@xmath2 that appears @xmath411 @xmath5 above the main peak .",
    "though , from bulk to single layer wse@xmath2 , there is no visible change in the calculated phonon dispersion ( figs .",
    "[ fig2](b , d , e ) , our measurements show that a new peak develops ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ) and this new peak appears to be very sensitive to the number of layers .",
    "for single layer wse@xmath2 , decomposition of the vibration representation is calculated to be @xmath22 .",
    "here , the @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 modes correspond to the @xmath26 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes for bulk respectively .",
    "since the @xmath24 and @xmath27 modes are almost degenerate , only one raman peak is expected to be observed in the experiment which contradicts our experimental results . before discussing more on the discrepancy",
    ", we note that presence of contaminants at the wse2/interface and/or directly bonded to the tmd monolayer might cause small alterations to the raman spectrum .",
    "however , if the contaminants are directly bonded ( chemisorption ) to the tmd , one would expect to observe drastic differences in the raman spectrum as a result of renormalization of phonon dispersion . since the overall monolayer raman spectrum is similar to few - layer",
    ", we eliminate this possibility .",
    "if the contaminants are chemically interacting locally , this would change the raman signal from those local regions ( bloch waves intermix ) but would be small comparing to overall raman signal due to the geometrical considerations and reduced raman sensitivity of the locally interacting region . to explain the emergence of the new peak , we consider external factors , such as compressive and tensile strain acting on few - layer and monolayer wse@xmath2 flakes , which is likely to be induced by the interaction with the substrate .",
    "to test the possibility of strain effects on wse@xmath2 as the origin for such splitting of the raman peak , we calculate the phonon dispersion of monolayer wse@xmath2 after applying 1@xmath28 biaxial compressive and tensile strain . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , such biaxial deformation only results in a collective softening / hardening of the vibrational modes and does not lift the degeneracy of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 in single layer ) implying that these modes remain degenerate as long as the hexagonal symmetry of the monolayer wse@xmath2 is retained .",
    "next , we apply uniaxial strain that is likely to occur along with the biaxial strain on monolayer wse@xmath2 exfoliated on si / sio@xmath2 surface . for hexagonally ordered crystal structures uniaxial strain can be applied in two main directions : armchair and zigzag ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ) .",
    "interestingly , in the presence of uniaxial strain , degeneracy of the branches forming the most prominent raman peak are broken .",
    "while most of the modes between 200 - 280 @xmath5 loose their symmetry that determines the raman activity , our symmetry analysis shows that two of the branches that correspond to the @xmath24 ( lower ) and @xmath25 ( upper ) modes are still raman active . for compressive ( tensile ) uniaxial strain along the armchair direction",
    "the difference between the @xmath24 and @xmath25 modes is 16 ( 18 ) @xmath5 .",
    "similarly , for compressive ( tensile ) strain along the zigzag direction , splitting is calculated to be 13 ( 17 ) @xmath5 . here",
    "the @xmath24-@xmath25 splitting induced by uniaxial strain is in good agreement with our experimental data .",
    "it is worth to note that independent from the direction of both tensile and compressive strains both have the same splitting effect on the raman peaks .",
    "according to our phonon dispersion calculations performed on bulk wse@xmath2 , the out - of - plane ( a@xmath15 ) and in - plane ( e@xmath16 ) modes are degenerate in energy , consistent with the experimental measurements taken on bulk wse@xmath2 .",
    "experimentally , as the dimension is lowered from 3d to 2d ( bulk to monolayers ) , raman mode located at around @xmath4  250 @xmath5 splits in two peaks at @xmath4  250 @xmath5 and 261 @xmath5 . to provide an explanation for the broken degeneracy , we recalculate the phonon dispersion of monolayer wse@xmath2 under uniaxial and biaxial strain / stress .",
    "our theoretical results imply that the degeneracy of these two modes is lifted only if the crystal symmetry is broken , i.e. in the presence of uniaxial strain .",
    "when the monolayer wse@xmath2 is under very little unaxial strain or stress , our theoretical calculations show a remarkable match with the experimental data . considering above arguments , we next argue about the possible origin of uniaxial strain on thin wse@xmath2 flakes . since our sio@xmath2 substrates typically display 4 - 8   surface roughness ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](d - e ) ) that is of the same order of a single unit cell thickness , even perfect sio@xmath2/wse@xmath2 interface is likely to induce a mild strain to the wse@xmath2 monolayer .",
    "the presence of the surface roughness on sio@xmath2 can be observed clearly when compared to sapphire which yields only 1 - 2   surface roughness .",
    "typically , these rough features are asymmetric in shape and therefore strain induced on the few - layer wse@xmath2 is expected to have both biaxial and uniaxial component .",
    "however , since the biaxial strain does not lift the degeneracy only the uniaxial component of the total strain results in raman peak splitting .",
    "moreover , in the presence of residual contaminants at the wse@xmath2/sio@xmath2 interface and/or residues deposited after the exfoliation step , the effect of strain is likely to be amplified . from this perspective",
    ", monolayers are most affected by the strain effects while thick flakes remain mostly unaltered .",
    "another scenario might be associated with the unintentional strain induced during the exfoliation process . in such case ,",
    "the wse@xmath2 monolayers are deposited on the sio@xmath2 substrates during the exfoliation and is not necessarily related to the surface residue .",
    "however , we note that our results were confirmed on 50 different wse@xmath2 monolayers where the same results have been found making this scenario .",
    "another indirect confirmation of presence of uniaxial strain comes from the changes in the pl peak position .",
    "we also note that the band gap at the k - k symmetry point is expected to be independent from the dimensionality . on the contrary ,",
    "pl measurements show that the k - k gap increases abruptly for the monolayer , likely due to the presence of small uniaxial strain ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](g ) ) as is confirmed by our dft calculations .",
    "we also point out that in the presence of large density of defects , the degeneracy can be lifted .",
    "however , similar measurements taken on more than fifty independently prepared samples makes this case unlikely .    in conclusion , phonon dispersion and the electronic properties of bulk to monolayer wse@xmath2",
    "have been studied both experimentally and theoretically . unlike the other members of the tmds",
    ", the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes are degenerate in bulk wse@xmath2 and the degeneracy is lifted for as the dimension is lowered . on the contrary to our experimental results , calculated phonon dispersion show that these modes remain degenerate independent from the dimensionality .",
    "however , theoretically the degeneracy is only lifted when the crystal symmetry is broken , i.e. in the presence of unaxial strain which might be induced by the interaction with the substrate , residues , and/or exfoliation process .",
