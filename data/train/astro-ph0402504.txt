    "the dynamical structure of disc galaxies is dominated by angular momentum . therefore , understanding the origin of angular momentum in these systems is crucial in any theory of galaxy formation . in the current paradigm for structure formation",
    ", dark matter is assumed to be cold and collisionless and luminous galaxies form by gas infall into dark matter halos , which grow by gravitational accretion and merging in a hierarchical fashion ( white @xmath6 reese 1978 ) .",
    "fall @xmath6 efstathiou ( 1980 , hereafter fe80 ) proposed that the sizes of galactic disks are linked to the angular momentum of their parent dark matter halos .",
    "this theory is able to produce disks with sizes that are in agreement with observations , if the gas initially had the same specific angular momentum as dark matter halos show today and if the gas preserved its specific angular momentum during the protogalactic collapse phase .",
    "the angular momentum of galaxies results from torques due to tidal interactions with neighbouring structures , acquired early , before the halo decoupled from the hubble expansion .",
    "many models for the formation of galactic disks have been proposed , based on the picture of fe80 .",
    "most of them incorporate the mass accretion history of halos and are able to reproduce many properties of observed disk galaxies ( e.g. mo , mao @xmath6 white 1998 ; firmani @xmath6 avila - reese 2000 ; van den bosch 2000 ) .",
    "however , in these models , the angular momentum of the dark matter halos is assigned without accounting for their merging history .",
    "recent results from numerical n - body simulations have pointed out that the effect of major mergers is to increase the mean angular momentum content of the halos ( gardner 2001 , g01 hereafter ; vitvitska et al .",
    "this is explained by the orbital angular momentum of the merging halos which dominates the final net angular momentum of the remnant ( g01 ) .",
    "however , numerical simulations that incorporate gas dynamics have difficulties to make realistic disk galaxies in the current cosmological paradigm . in most simulations ,",
    "the disks are smaller , denser and have much lower angular momenta than observed disk systems .",
    "simulations show that galaxies are built up by merging of baryonic subclumps , rather than smooth accretion of gas .",
    "most of the gas cools at the centre of subhalos and spirals toward the center of the parent halo , transferring orbital angular momentum to the surrounding dark matter ( e.g. navarro @xmath6 steinmetz 2000 ) .",
    "more acceptable fits to real disk systems can be found if heuristic prescriptions of stellar feedback are included in the simulations ( sommer - larsen et al .",
    "2003 ; abadi et al .",
    "2003 , robertson et al .",
    "however , even in these simulations the disk systems typically contain denser and more massive bulges than observed in late - type galaxies .",
    "most of the previous work has focused on angular momentum properties of halos that had at least one dominant major merger during their evolution . in this letter",
    "we explore the angular momentum properties of halos that did not experience any major merger since redshift 3 and that are in principle good candidates to host bulgeless galaxies .",
    "we demonstrate that even these galaxies have an angular momentum problem that is directly related with the spin of their dark halos and can not be solved easily by energetic feedback processes .",
    "we performed three simulations within a @xmath0cdm cosmological universe with @xmath7 , @xmath8=0.7 , @xmath9=h@xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the simulated volume was 15 @xmath13 mpc box size in all runs .",
    "each simulation was performed using the publicly available version of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gadget ( springel , yoshida @xmath6 white 2001 ) .",
    "all runs started at redshifts sufficiently high to ensure that the absolute maximum density contrast @xmath14 .",
    "the simulations began from a spatially uniform grid of @xmath15 equal - mass particles with plummer  equivalent softening comoving length of @xmath16 kpc .",
    "the particle masses was @xmath17 @xmath13 m@xmath18 .",
    "we identify halos with the classic friend - of - friend ( fof ) method using a linking length that corresponds to the mean interparticle separation at that density contour that defines the virial radius of an isothermal sphere , @xmath19^{-1/3}$]=0.15 , where @xmath20 is the particle number density and @xmath21 is the corresponding virial density .",
    "all halos at z=0 with masses between m@xmath22 @xmath13 m@xmath18 , containing at least 1000 particles are included in the analyses .",
    "this restriction limits the influence of numerical effects on global halo properties .",
    "disks with non - negligible bulge components of @xmath23 , with b and d the bulge and disk mass , respectively , require a major merger which involved at least 10% of their final mass ( i.e. at least 100 particles ) .",
    "our focus on halos with final particle numbers of at least 1000 therefore guarantees that we do nt miss any relevant major merger events due to softening .",
    "we also did not find a dependence of our results on the adopted mass range of dark halos at @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , neglecting smaller halos will not affect our conclusions .",
    "the angular momentum of a galaxy , @xmath25 , is commonly expressed in terms of the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath26gm@xmath27where @xmath28 is the total energy , and m is the total mass .",
    "the halo spin parameter distribution in simulations is found to be well approximated by the log - normal function : + @xmath29 \\frac{\\rm{d}\\lambda}{\\lambda}\\ ] ] in practise , it is more convenient to use the modified spin parameter ( bullock et al .",
    "2001 ) : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the specific angular momentum . for a @xmath0cdm cosmology",
    "the log - normal parameters are found to be @xmath32 and @xmath33=0.5 - 0.6 ( bullock et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "we trace each identified halo backward in time , following the mass of the most massive progenitor as a function of redshift during @xmath34 .",
    "our results do nt change if we include major mergers at higher redshifts since they in general do nt include a last mass fraction .",
    "in addition , the gas content of halos with such a high redshift is probably large and the result of a major merger is very unclear ( bullock et al . 2001 ) .",
    "we start when the mass of the most massive progenitor is 30% of the z=0 mass . assuming instead 50% of the halo mass at present time does not change the results . to identify mergers ,",
    "we denote a halo as a major merger remnant if at some time during @xmath34 its major progenitor was classified as a single group in one output , but two separate groups with a mass ratio@xmath35 in the preceeding output",
    ". the critical mass ratio of 4:1 for a major merger event is based on results of n - body simulations which show that at least such a mass ratio is required in order to produce a spheroidal elliptical galaxy with a surface density profile that agrees with observations of early - type galaxies ( burkert & naab 2003 , bn03 hereafter ) .",
    "we find that 1:1 and 2:1 mergers are much more frequent than 3:1 or 4:1 mergers , in agreement with earlier results by khochfar @xmath6 burkert ( 2004 ) , based on an analyses of a much larger cube . as discussed earlier , we expecte our identified halo population to be complete at z=0 for masses",
    "@xmath36 m@xmath18 . a slight incompleteness for 4:1 mergers right at this mass limit",
    "is expected which should however not affect our results , as 4:1 mergers in this limited mass range are very rare . for each halo",
    "we identify the time of the last major merger .",
    "we assume that accretion events and minor mergers encrease the mass of the disk component whereas major mergers convert all the available gas into stars and destroy disks , forming a stellar spheroid ( bn03 ) . neglecting galactic winds and assuming a universal baryon fraction for all infalling substructures , the final ratio between bulge mass b and the sum of bulge and disk mass ( b+d ) is given by the ratio of the dark halo mass at the time of the last major merger , divided by the dark halo mass at @xmath24 .",
    "fig.1 shows the b/(b+d ) ratio at z=0 of halos analysed in one of our simulations as a function of their spin parameter @xmath37 . for better visualisation",
    "we just plot the results of one run as the other two runs show similar trends .",
    "different symbols are used to denote halos that have their last major merger at different epochs ( see legend in fig.1 ) .",
    "the plot shows that the halo spin parameter is a function of the ratio between bulge mass and total baryonic mass .",
    "many halos with high b/(b+d ) ratios also show higher @xmath37 values than the average @xmath38 in the log - normal distribution ( filled symbols in fig.1 ) .",
    "most of these halos experienced a recent major merger in the redshift range @xmath39 .",
    "halos that have not experienced any major mergers from 0@xmath40 , show a log - normal distribution with @xmath41 , significantly lower than the value of 0.035 corresponding to the average referred to all halos .",
    "this finding confirms previous results that the last major merger event is affecting the final halo spin parameter distribution ( g01 ; vitvitska et al .",
    "2002 , peirani et al .",
    "2002 ) . in order to test",
    "how reasonable is to set to zero in fig.1 the bulge masses of halos that have not experienced any major merger from 0@xmath40 , we traced back the `` quiescient '' halos , attributing bulge masses different from zero to those halos with the last major merger occurs before z=3 .",
    "they show bulge mass b between 1%-7% of the sum of bulge and disk mass ( b+d ) .",
    "since we are interested in bulgeless galaxies , we focus here on halos with a quiet merging history dominated by minor mergers and accretion which corresponds to roughly 10% of all halos",
    ". it would be interesting to compare the theoretically predicted frequency of bulgeless galaxies with observations .",
    "this would however require a much larger survey with higher resolution and larger box sizes which we postpone to a subsequent paper .    in the general picture of fe80",
    ", disks should have the same distribution of total specific angular momentum as the dark matter halos , with the same value for the spin parameter , @xmath42 .",
    "this is expected because all the material experiences the same external torques during the early expansion phase before separating into two distinct components as a result of dissipative processes during the collapse phase .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that gas and dark matter have identical angular momentum distributions after the protogalactic collapse if cooling is ignored ( van den bosch et al .",
    "2002 ) . during the protogalactic collapse phase ,",
    "if cooling is included , baryons lose most of their initial angular momentum to the dark matter by dynamical friction ( navarro @xmath6 steimetz 2000 ) , resulting in galactic disks that are smaller than observed . suppression of early cooling of the gas by energetic heating e.g. through supernovae is invoked as a mechanism to prevent this angular momentum catastrophe .",
    "we find however that disk - dominated late - type galaxies inhabiting halos that have not experienced a major merger have a distribution of @xmath43 that peaks around a value of 0.023 which is substantially smaller than expected from observed rotation curves . to demonstrate that we use the results of van den bosch , burkert @xmath6 swaters ( 2001 , bbs hereafter ) who determined spin parameters for galactic disks of 14 late - type bulgeless dwarf galaxies .",
    "fig.1 shows the spin parameters of their galaxies , assuming a mass - to - light ratio of unity in the r band .",
    "the result is surprising : none of our models lies in the region of the diagram covered by the observational data .",
    "fig.2 ( top panel ) shows the probability distribution of the spin parameter of halos that did not experience any major mergers since z=3 ( dashed region ) and compares it with the normalized probability distribution of @xmath43 for the sample of galaxies measured by bbs .",
    "the dwarf galaxies show a distribution that follows a log - normal with an average value for @xmath44 , and a dispersion of @xmath45 .",
    "this is a factor of 3 larger than predicted by the numerical simulations .",
    "again , galactic disks would be too small .",
    "it is remarkable that multiplying the @xmath37 values of simulated halos by a factor 3.15 ( dotted histogram in fig.2 ) reproduces the peak and dispersion of the observed @xmath43 distribution quite well .",
    "thus , the discrepancy could be due to a systematic underestimation by a factor of 3 of the product r@xmath46v@xmath47 in the bbs sample .",
    "however , if r@xmath46v@xmath47 is increased of a factor of 3 , then m@xmath47 increases of a factor of @xmath48 , which implies a factor 5 smaller baryon fraction .",
    "the inferred baryon fraction in the bbs sample is already quite small ( see fig.3 of bbs ) .",
    "this solution therefore appears to be very unlikely . on the other hand , the dispersion @xmath33 derived from the observations is in good agreement with the dispersion 0.36 , derived for disk galaxies , based on an analysis of 1000 sb - sdm galaxies ( de jong @xmath6 lacey 2000 ) . in the bottom panel of fig.2",
    "we show the probability distribution of the spin parameter of the entire halo population ( thin solid line ) .",
    "the distribution is a log - normal with @xmath49 and a width @xmath50 .",
    "the value for @xmath51 is somewhat smaller than previous analysis ( g01 ; bullock et al .",
    "it is however still within the statistical uncertainties that will in future work be reduced by analysing larger cubes .",
    "the figure also shows the frequency of sub - populations are also included in the total halo histogram showing the result if major merger are defined as mergers with mass ratios @xmath52 ( thick solid line ) , @xmath53 ( dotted line ) and @xmath54 ( long - dashed line ) , respectively . note that the spin distributions of the late - type dwarfs in the bottom panel of fig.2 is in disagreement with all theoretical distributions .",
    "another point of concern could be a dependence of rotational properties on galaxy mass . in our simulations",
    "all analysed halos have masses between m@xmath22 @xmath13 m@xmath18 which is a factor of 10 to 100 larger than the inferred virial mass of the observed dwarf galaxies of the bbs sample .",
    "one might argue that halos of lower mass have higher spin parameters , although it is well known that the spin parameter distribution of halos is independent of mass ( lemson @xmath6 kauffmann 1999 ) .",
    "we have investigated this question and find no correlation between @xmath37 and @xmath55 of the quiet halos in our simulations .",
    "if bulgeless galaxies have not experienced any major mergers during their evolution our analysis shows that their dark halos are characterized by systematically lower angular momentum than observed .",
    "halos without major mergers acquire their specific angular momentum through tidal torques in the early epochs of evolution ( barnes @xmath6 efsthatiou 1987 ) , when the density contrasts were small , in accordance with the prediction of the linear theory . in fig.3 , top panel ,",
    "the spin parameter evolution of the major progenitors of two representative halos is shown . due to the lack of any major merger event",
    ", there is no sharp increase in @xmath37 which is characteristic for major mergers .",
    "instead , @xmath37 is almost constant and slightly increasing with time , proving that minor mergers and accretion does not affect or significantly decrease @xmath37 , in contradiction with claims of vitvitska et al .",
    "the bottom panel shows that the halos aggregate mass gradually by accretion of small subhalos .",
    "robertson et al . (",
    "2004 ) have recently presented the results of a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation where they form an extended , bulge - less disk galaxy . in our sample of `` quiescent '' halos ,",
    "there is one case with high spin value ( @xmath56 at z=0 ) , increasing more than a factor of 2 from z=0 and z=3 and no major merger during that time . in its accretion history ,",
    "mergers with mass ratio 1:5 , 1:6 seem to be enough to spin up the halo , although they are unlikely in cdm scenario .",
    "thus , of course this object could be a good candidate to be a bulgeless galaxies and we are resimulating it with higher resolution ( donghia et al . in preparation ) , but can not be considered as a representative `` quiescient '' halo .",
    "robertson et al .",
    "2004 could have simulated an object with similar properties , although the authors do nt report the spin parameter value or the accretion history of their object .",
    "the net result seems to be that tidal torques generate halos with typical spin parameters of @xmath57 whereas data for bulgeless galaxies indicate halos with values of @xmath58 .",
    "one might worry that our result is affected by the adopted small cosmological volume of 15 @xmath13 mpc box size , that might suppress torques by by larger - scale structures .",
    "however tidal forces scale as @xmath59 .",
    "compared to the forces that are generated by structures at a mpc distance , structures located at distances of 10 mpc need to have the mass @xmath60 larger than at 1 mpc to have the same effect on protogalaxies . at 100 mpc",
    ", the mass of the structure would have to be even@xmath61 times larger to torque protogalaxies efficiently , which is unlikely .",
    "in addition , our results are in agreement with the models of g01 for a larger volume of 100 mpc box size .    at the moment",
    "it is not at all clear how one can reconcile the observations and theory .",
    "it is known that the spin parameter distribution for the collapsed objetcs is insensitive to the shape of the initial power spectrum of density fluctuations , to the environment and the adopted cosmological model ( lemson @xmath6 kauffmann 1999 ) .",
    "a modification of the nature of dark matter does not seem to solve the problem either .",
    "recent works show that warm dark matter halos have systematically smaller spins than their counterparts in @xmath0cdm ( knebe et al . 2002 ; bullock , kravtsov @xmath6 colin 2002 ) , although in this scenario the presence of pancakes could provide more efficient torques on the protohalos .",
    "feedback was invoked as a mechanism to prevent the process of drastic angular momentum loss of infalling gas .",
    "( bbs ; maller , dekel @xmath6 somerville 2002 ) .",
    "however , we have shown here that the dark halos that experienced no major mergers have already too low an angular momentum to produce the observed disks and no feedback process is know that would increase the the specific angular momentum of the gas .",
    "the origin of extended bulgeless disk galaxies remains a puzzle .",
