    "the idea of embedding our universe in a higher dimensional space has attracted a considerable interest recently , due to the proposal by randall and sundrum that our four - dimensional ( 4d ) spacetime is a three - brane , embedded in a 5d spacetime ( the bulk )  @xcite . according to the brane world scenario , the physical fields ( electromagnetic , yang - mills etc . ) in our 4d universe are confined to the three brane .",
    "only gravity can freely propagate in both the brane and bulk spacetimes , with the gravitational self - couplings not significantly modified .",
    "even if the fifth dimension is uncompactified , standard 4d gravity is reproduced on the brane .",
    "hence this model allows the presence of large , or even infinite non - compact extra dimensions .",
    "our brane is identified to a domain wall in a 5d anti - de sitter spacetime . in the brane world scenario ,",
    "the fundamental scale of gravity is not the planck scale , but another scale which may be at the tev level ( for a review of the dynamics and geometry of brane world models see  @xcite ) . due to the correction terms coming from the extra dimensions ,",
    "significant deviations from the standard einstein theory occur at very high energies   @xcite .",
    "gravity is largely modified at the electro - weak scale of about @xmath0  tev .",
    "the cosmological and astrophysical implications of the brane world theories have been extensively investigated in the physical literature  @xcite .",
    "the static vacuum gravitational field equations on the brane depend on the generally unknown weyl stresses , which can be expressed in terms of two functions , called the dark radiation @xmath1 and the dark pressure @xmath2 terms ( the projections of the weyl curvature of the bulk , generating non - local brane stresses )  @xcite .",
    "several classes of spherically symmetric solutions of the static gravitational field equations in the vacuum on the brane have been obtained in  @xcite . as a possible physical application of these solutions the behavior of the angular velocity @xmath3 of the test particles in stable circular orbits",
    "has been considered  @xcite .",
    "the observed properties of the rotational galactic curves  @xcite can be naturally explained in the brane world models , without introducing any additional hypothesis .",
    "the galaxy is embedded in a modified , spherically symmetric geometry , generated by the non - zero contribution of the weyl tensor from the bulk .",
    "the extra terms , which can be described in terms of the dark radiation term @xmath1 and the dark pressure term @xmath2 , act as a `` matter '' distribution outside the galaxy .",
    "the particles moving in this geometry feel the gravitational effects of @xmath1 , which can be expressed in terms of an equivalent mass @xmath4 ( the dark mass )  @xcite .",
    "the role of the cross - over length scale in the possible explanation of the dark - matter phenomenon in the brane world model was investigated in @xcite .",
    "similar interpretations of the dark matter as a bulk effect have been also considered in  @xcite .    for standard general relativistic spherical compact objects the exterior space - time",
    "is described by the schwarzschild metric . in the five dimensional brane world models , the high energy corrections to the energy density , together with",
    "the weyl stresses from bulk gravitons , imply that on the brane the exterior metric of a static star is no longer the schwarzschild metric @xcite .",
    "the presence of the weyl stresses also means that the matching conditions do not have a unique solution on the brane ; the knowledge of the five - dimensional weyl tensor is needed as a minimum condition for uniqueness .",
    "static , spherically symmetric exterior vacuum solutions of the brane world models have been obtained first in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "the first of these solutions has the mathematical form of the reissner - nordstrom solution of the standard general relativity , in which a tidal weyl parameter plays the role of the electric charge of the general relativistic solution @xcite .",
    "a second exterior solution , which also matches a constant density interior , has been derived in @xcite .",
    "other vacuum solutions of the field equations in the brane world model have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "generally , the vacuum field equations on the brane can be reduced to a system of two ordinary differential equations , which describe all the geometric properties of the vacuum as functions of the dark pressure and dark radiation terms  @xcite . in order to close the system of vacuum field equations on the brane",
    "a functional relation between these two quantities is necessary .",
    "hence , a first possible approach to the study of the vacuum brane consists in adopting an explicit equation of state for the dark pressure as a function of the dark radiation .",
    "the explicit form of this equation can be obtained by assuming that the brane obeys different geometrical or physical conditions .",
    "the existence of the group of the homology transformations on the brane uniquely fixes the form of the equation of state @xcite ) . by assuming that the vacuum admits the group of conformal motions leads to the full determination of the equation of state of the dark pressure @xcite . by imposing the condition of the constancy of the rotational velocity curves for particle in stable orbits closes the system of the field equations , and the dark radiation and pressure",
    "can be obtained explicitly @xcite .",
    "this approach has the advantage of making predictions that may be tested directly by observations .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to consider an alternative possibility for constraining the equation of state of the dark pressure on the brane .",
    "the structure equations of the vacuum can be transformed to an autonomous system of two differential equations , which in turn may be reduced to a single , second order differential equation .",
    "a second order differential equation can be investigated in geometric terms by using the general path - space theory of kosambi - cartan - chern ( kcc - theory ) inspired by the geometry of a finsler space @xcite .",
    "the kcc theory is a differential geometric theory of the variational equations for the deviation of the whole trajectory to nearby ones . by associating a non - linear connection and a berwald type connection to the differential system ,",
    "five geometrical invariants are obtained .",
    "the second invariant gives the jacobi stability of the system @xcite .",
    "the kcc theory has been applied for the study of different physical , biochemical or technical systems ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    as a toy model for the applications of the kcc theory for the study of the jacobi stability of the vacuum in the brane world models we consider the case of the linear equation of state for the dark pressure , @xmath5 .",
    "the vacuum on the brane is jacobi stable only for a very limited range of the proportionality constant @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and it is jacobi unstable for all the other possible values of @xmath6 .",
    "hence the natural physical requirement of jacobi stability provides a very strong constraint on the equation of state of the dark pressure , and on the physical / geometrical properties of the model .",
    "such a constraint can not be obtained from the linear ( lyapunov ) stability analysis , which is also considered in detail .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "the field equations for the vacuum on the brane are written down in section ii .",

    "the linear stability analysis of the structure equations of the vacuum for a linear equation of state for the dark pressure is performed in section v. the jacobi stability of the structure equations is analyzed in section vi .",
    "we discuss and conclude our results in section vii .",
    "in the present section we briefly describe the basic mathematical formalism of the brane world models , present the field equations for a static , spherically symmetric vacuum brane , and discuss some of their consequences .",
    "we start by considering a five dimensional ( 5d ) spacetime ( the bulk ) , with a single four - dimensional ( 4d ) brane , on which matter is confined .",

    "the basic equations on the brane are obtained by projections onto the brane world .",
    "the induced 4d metric is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the space - like unit vector field normal to the brane hypersurface @xmath33 . in the following we assume @xmath34 . in the brane world models only gravity can probe the extra dimensions .    assuming a metric of the form @xmath35 , with @xmath36 the unit normal to the @xmath37 hypersurfaces and @xmath38 the induced metric on @xmath37 hypersurfaces , the effective 4d gravitational equation on the brane takes the form  @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the local quadratic energy - momentum correction @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the non - local effect from the free bulk gravitational field , the transmitted projection of the bulk weyl tensor @xmath43 , @xmath44 , with the property @xmath45as@xmath46 .",

    "the einstein equation in the bulk and the codazzi equation also imply the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor of the matter on the brane , @xmath54 , where @xmath55 denotes the brane covariant derivative .",
    "moreover , from the contracted bianchi identities on the brane it follows that the projected weyl tensor obeys the constraint @xmath56 .",

    "the jacobi ( in)stability is a natural generalization of the ( in)stability of the geodesic flow on a differentiable manifold endowed with a metric ( riemannian or finslerian ) to the non - metric setting . in other words , we may say that jacobi unstable trajectories of a dynamical system behave chaotically in the sense that after a finite interval of time it would be impossible to distinguish the trajectories that were very near each other at an initial moment .",
    "we have found that there is a good correlation between the linear stability of the critical point @xmath246 and the robustness of the corresponding trajectory to small perturbations . indeed , for small values of the parameter @xmath249",
    "the saddle point is also jacobi unstable ( @xmath250 and @xmath251 ) , while the stable spiral obtained for @xmath252 is also robust to a small perturbation of all trajectories .",
    "it is interesting to remark that for the interval @xmath253 , the stable node is actually jacobi unstable .",
    "in other words , even the system trajectories are attracted by the critical point @xmath246 one has to be aware of the fact that they are not stable to small perturbation of the whole trajectory .",
    "this means that one might witness chaotic behavior of the system trajectories before they enters in a neighborhood of @xmath246 .",
    "we have here a sort of stability artifact that can not be found without using the powerful method of jacobi stability analysis .",

    "<S> we analyze the stability of the structure equations of the vacuum in the brane world models , by using both the linear ( lyapunov ) stability analysis , and the jacobi stability analysis , the kosambi - cartan - chern ( kcc ) theory . in the brane world models the four dimensional effective einstein equations acquire extra terms , called dark radiation and dark pressure , respectively , which arise from the embedding of the 3-brane in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> generally , the spherically symmetric vacuum solutions of the brane gravitational field equations , have properties quite distinct as compared to the standard black hole solutions of general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> we close the structure equations by assuming a simple linear equation of state for the dark pressure . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum is jacobi stable only for a small range of values of the proportionality constant relating the dark pressure and the dark radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the unstable trajectories on the brane behave chaotically , in the sense that after a finite radial distance it would be impossible to distinguish the trajectories that were very near each other at an initial point . </S>",
    "<S> hence the jacobi stability analysis offers a powerful method for constraining the physical properties of the vacuum on the brane . </S>"
