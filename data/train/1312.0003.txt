    "there are several ways to test the geometry of a cosmological model and its expansion , i.e. , that redshifts of the galaxies are cosmological and not due to an alternative mechanism ( narlikar 1989 ; lpez - corredoira 2003 , section 2.1 ; lpez - corredoira 2006 )",
    ". however , almost all of the cosmological tests are entangled with the evolution of galaxies and/or other effects .",
    "hubble diagrams ( laviolette 1986 ; schade et al .",
    "1997 ; marosi 2013 ) , tolman surface  brightness tests ( lubin & sandage 2001 ; andrews 2006 ; lerner 2006 ) , angular size tests ( kapahi 1987 ; kellerman 1993 ; lpez - corredoira 2010 ) are all affected by the evolution of galaxies at high redshifts . so far , there are no standard rods in physical objects .",
    "the ultra - compact radio sources which were claimed in the past to be free of evolutionary effects are now thought to present some evolution as well ( lpez - corredoira 2010 ; pashchenko & vitrishchak 2011 ) .",
    "lpez - corredoira ( 2010 ) thinks that the huge size evolution necessary to fit an angular size test with an expanding universe is not understood , but it still depends on our understanding of the galaxies rather than on pure cosmological approaches .",
    "baryonic acoustic oscillations ( baos ) in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) or in the large scale structure are usually thought to be standard rods to measure the cosmological expansion ( e.g. , rassat & refregier 2012 ) ; however their features in the power spectrum are not a direct observable quantity free of assumptions ( one must assume at least that bao peaks represent a faint imprint of the sound waves in the clustering of galaxies and matter today excited by the initial inflationary perturbations , i.e. the assumption that the scenario of standard cosmology is correct ) and these peaks could be generated with other cosmological assumptions different from the standard interpretation of acoustic peaks ( lpez - corredoira & gabrielli 2013 ) .",
    "time dilation tests in type ia supernovae ( snia ) look like one of the most successful tests in favor of the expansion of the universe ( goldhaber et al . 2001 ; blondin et al .",
    "2008 ) , but they do not serve to test the geometry of the universe , and there are still some problems in the interpretation . the fact that sne ia light curves are narrower when redder ( nobili & goobar 2008 ) is an inconvenience for a clean test free of selection effects . other selection effects and the possible compatibility of the results with a wider range of cosmological models , including static ones ,",
    "were also pointed out by lpez - corredoira ( 2003 , section 2 and references therein ) , brynjolfsson ( 2004b ) ; leaning ( 2006 ) ; crawford ( 2009b , 2011 ) ; holushko ( 2012 ) , and laviolette ( 2012 , section 7.8 ) .",
    "moreover , neither gamma - ray bursts ( crawford 2009a ) nor qsos ( hawkins 2010 ) present time dilation , which is puzzling .    there are , of course , the cmbr anisotropies as a way to test cosmological models ; they are , perhaps , the most important support for the standard model",
    ". however , one should find an independent confirmation , because it is possible to generate / modify cmbr anisotropies by mechanisms different than the standard cosmology ( narlikar et al .",
    "2007 ; angus & diaferio 2011 ; lpez - corredoira & gabrielli 2013 ; lpez - corredoira 2013 ) and/or contamination ( lpez - corredoira 2007 ) .    the microwave background temperature measured from rotational excitation of some molecules as a function of redshift ( molaro et al . 2002 ; noterdaeme et al .",
    "2011 ) is another possible test and was quite successful in proving the expansion : results from noterdaeme et al .",
    "( 2011 ) with the exact expected dependence of @xmath4 are impressive . nonetheless , there are other results which disagree with that dependence ( krelowski et al .",
    "2012 ; sato et al .",
    ". it might be due to a dependence on collisional excitation ( molaro et al .",
    "2002 ) or bias due to unresolved structure ( sato et al .",
    ".    the temperature of the intergalactic medium as a function of redshift might also be useful to constrain more directly the geometry of the universe . at present",
    ", it is typically inferred to be 20,000 k ; there is no evidence of evolution with redshift ( zaldarriaga et al .",
    "2001 ) , which is puzzling in an expanding universe .    here",
    ", we propose an alcock & paczyski ( 1979 ) cosmological test : an evaluation of the ratio of observed angular size to radial / redshift size ( see detailed explanation in section [ .method ] ) .",
    "the main advantage of this test is that it does not depend on the evolution of the galaxies , but only on the geometry of the universe .",
    "however , the redshift distortions ( kaiser 1987 ; hamilton 1998 ) do also have an influence .",
    "although there already have been many attempts to carry out this test ( see references in section [ .2pcf ] ) , here we adapt the method ( sections [ .method ] and [ .2pcf_calc ] ) and focus on the application as a test for any cosmological model , whereas other authors assume the standard cosmology and just fit some of their parameters",
    ". we apply it to three spectroscopic surveys with a total of @xmath5 galaxies up to redshift 0.8 and @xmath6 qsos at higher redshifts ( sections [ .application ] and [ .fitcosmo ] ) .",
    "as will be discussed in section [ .conclusions ] , this test will give us information about which cosmological model fits better .",
    "hence , this is a cosmological test free of entanglement with evolution , for checking both the geometry and the expansion of the universe .",
    "certainly , this exercise is not going to solve the question once and for all , but the method is a possible way to do it with the increasing possibility of future huge spectroscopic surveys .",
    "the key point of the test is based on the fact that the two - point correlation function in a distribution of galaxies in the real space must have spherical symmetry , that is , it only depends on the distance between the sources and not on any of the two angles which define the relative position between the two sources .",
    "this means that the fall of the two - point correlation function as a function of the distance must be the same either along the line of sight ( @xmath7 ) or perpendicular to it ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the distance of two sources along the line of sight is given by the difference of redshift , @xmath9 , and depends on the cosmological model .",
    "the distance of two sources in the direction perpendicular to the line of sight is given by the angular separation , @xmath10 , and also depends on the cosmological model ; this is precisely what gives meaning to the angular - size tests .",
    "the comoving distance between two sources at redshift @xmath11 separated by a relatively small @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( radians ) in the redshift - space is ( see appendix  [ .cosmomodels ] ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the speed of light , @xmath14 is the hubble constant , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are functions which depend on the cosmological model . for the standard concordance model ( with the equation of state for the dark energy @xmath17 ) : @xmath18 @xmath19 see appendix [ .cosmomodels ] for their dependence in other cosmological models ; they are plotted in figure [ fig : models ] .",
    "all models have in common that @xmath20 , but there are already some differences for low z there are some differences ; in appendix [ .cosmomodels ] , we give the limits of @xmath21 for @xmath16 . for high @xmath11 ,",
    "the differences are even higher . the possibility of deriving @xmath16 free of selection effects , evolution , redshift distortion , etc . , would tell us which theoretical model is correct .    furthermore , note that even assuming the standard model as correct , the derivation of @xmath16 would allow us to determine @xmath2 and @xmath22 . for low @xmath11 in the concordance model ( equation ( [ lowz_1 ] ) ) :",
    "@xmath23 , so a high  precision measurement of @xmath16 in the local universe could give us a direct measurement of @xmath2 ( and consequently @xmath22 , assuming @xmath24 ) .",
    "this measurement of @xmath16 is possible , as we will see next .",
    "as said , the two - point correlation function of a distribution of galaxies ( @xmath25 ) should only depend on the comoving distance , @xmath26 , in the real space for a given redshift , i.e. , @xmath27 .",
    "for the redshift - space ( @xmath28 ) , there is no spherical symmetry because we also have the redshift - space distortions in the field @xmath25 produced by the peculiar velocities of the gravitational infall . in the linear regime of fluctuations , assuming @xmath29 ( this is an acceptable approximation for scales @xmath30 @xmath31mpc , e.g. , ross et al .",
    "2007 ; sylos labini et al .",
    "2009 ; see also figure [ fig : xi0 ] ) with distortion parameter @xmath32 , @xmath33 , \\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the cosine of the angle between @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; @xmath37 ; and the function @xmath38 is ( matsubara & suto 1996 ) : @xmath39 hence , in polar coordinates @xmath40 , @xmath41 : @xmath42@xmath43 , \\]]@xmath44 where @xmath45 stands for certain amplitude .",
    "note that we do not use @xmath46 , like most of the references that talk about the anisotropic two - point correlation function , because we are not assuming any cosmology a priori .",
    "the advantage of the expression in equation ( [ xi ] ) is that it relates an observable function totally free of any modeling to the cosmology implicit in the values of @xmath16 , and the redshift - space distortions implicit in @xmath32 .",
    "if we wanted to calculate @xmath46 , we would have to obtain @xmath47 and @xmath48 using a given cosmological model and change / rescale this calculation every time we wanted to test another model .    in figure",
    "[ fig : elipses ] , the effect of the redshift distortion is illustrated . if we had no redshift distortions ( @xmath49 )",
    ", @xmath50 would not depend on @xmath34 and , for a fixed @xmath11 , when we plotted @xmath25 in the plane of @xmath51 , @xmath9 , the isocontours would be ellipses with axial ratios @xmath16 of the second / first axes ( figure [ fig : elipses]c ) . for the general case , we must consider redshift distortions .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 takes into account , as said , the large - scale effects of linear @xmath11-space distortions ( hamilton 1998 ) .",
    "usually , in a standard scenario , it is related to cosmological information as @xmath52 ( kaiser 1987 ) , where @xmath53 is the bias parameter , but here , in general and for any cosmological scenario , @xmath54 will be simply a parameter from which we will not extract any further information",
    ". we must be aware that kaiser s formalism was developed for the standard cosmology including expansion ; however , this remains valid for any model , provided that the meaning of @xmath54 is changed .",
    "in general , it is valid when the gravitational infall is given such that @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the velocity field and @xmath57 the matter overdensity ( in the linear regime ) ; this yields even for a static universe .",
    "the continuity and euler equation remain the same thing in all models , but the poisson equation changes with the gravitational model as well as the evolution of the linear growth of overdensities , thus giving rise to different equivalences of @xmath54 with the cosmological parameters .    the small - scale random motion of the galaxies",
    "should also be included in an analysis with small bin size : we should convolve equation ( [ xi ] ) with a gaussian distribution of @xmath9 ( e.g. , ross et al .",
    "2007 , section 4.2 ) to get the correct @xmath50 ; however , we will neglect this correction since the dispersion of velocities is @xmath58 300 km s@xmath59 ( ross et al .",
    "2007 ) , equivalent to @xmath60 , which is much smaller than our bin sizes .",
    "the low values of @xmath10 in which the features known as the `` fingers of god '' ( jackson 1972 ) are observed are not explored here .",
    "obtaining @xmath16 for different values of @xmath11 and comparing it with theoretical predictions of different cosmological models ( figure [ fig : models ] ) , perhaps allowing for some variation of @xmath2 instead of a fixed value , is theoretically a good way to constrain cosmology .",
    "nonetheless , a difficulty arises from the quasi - degeneracy between the variations of @xmath16 and @xmath32 , i.e. between geometric and dynamic distortions , respectively .",
    "the range of possible cosmological models compatible with the data for some free @xmath54 is too large ( e.g. , ross et al . 2007 ) , thus making it difficult to disentangle geometric and dynamic distortions .",
    "there are some methods to obtain @xmath32 from @xmath25 ( e.g. , hamilton 1992 , 1998 ; tocchini - valentini et al .",
    "2012 ) or from @xmath61 in a sample of galaxies ( patiri et al .",
    "2012 ) , but they depend on @xmath16 .",
    "nonetheless , there are ways to attack the problem .",
    "some approaches to our problem try to fit @xmath54 for the different cosmological models [ that is , fixing @xmath16 ] and adopt as valid cosmological the one which gives better fit to the function @xmath25 ( e.g. , marulli et al . 2012 ) .    here",
    "we carry out something similar : a weighted fit , but as a function of @xmath9 and @xmath51 , instead of @xmath48 and @xmath47 , and , in order to solve better the quasi - degeneracy of @xmath54 and @xmath63 , we set a constraint for @xmath54 to follow @xmath64an amount which is independent of @xmath63 .",
    "we exclude from the fit the pixel ( 1,1 ) , because it contains higher nonlinear effects of the correlation and errors from binning . in practice , instead of taking strictly @xmath65 ( equivalent to @xmath66 ) , we take @xmath67 , i.e. , the first column ( for the galaxies samples ) .",
    "the effect of random velocities or the `` finger of god '' is negligible in the calculation of this last quantity for our bin sizes of @xmath68 ( for the galaxies samples ) : numerical calculations give errors of @xmath69% in @xmath70 with respect to the inclusion of velocity dispersions in @xmath9 with a gaussian distribution of @xmath71 , which is negligible in comparison with other sources of errors .",
    "if we obtained @xmath72 , we would set @xmath73 and recalculate the error bar to get 68% probability in the range @xmath74 within 1@xmath75 .",
    "the error bars of @xmath76 , @xmath63 and @xmath54 are given by the values which produce a @xmath77 + 3.5 $ ] ( the value of 3.5 defines the region with a 68% confidence level ( cl ) in a three - free - parameter fit ; avni 1976 ) .",
    "note that the error bars of @xmath54 and @xmath63 should include both the transmitted errors for a fixed value of @xmath76 and the variations of those values due to the variation of @xmath76 within the range of its error bar ; we will do so throughout this paper .",
    "tests have been carried out with monte carlo simulations and we could see that we recover approximately the introduced parameters . for instance , in figure [ fig : montec ] , we show the recovered values of @xmath78 versus the introduced values of the fit @xmath79 in a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the conditions are @xmath80 , different values of @xmath81 , and noise with relative rms equal to @xmath82 with @xmath83 over an area subdivided into 8x8 bins of size 0.0025 . as can be observed ,",
    "we recover roughly the value of @xmath63 plus some noise .",
    "many authors have already realized on the advantages of using the anisotropic correlation function to measure the ratio of observed angular size to radial / redshift size and applied it as a possible way to constrain cosmological models .",
    "it was analyzed in ballinger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , marulli et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , phillips ( 1994 ) for quasar pairs , ryden ( 1995 ) for voids , kim & croft ( 2007 ) for clusters , and nusser ( 2005 ) for radio emission in the epoch of reionization , among others .",
    "it was applied to real data of several surveys with galaxies ( blake et al .",
    "2011 ) , luminous red galaxies ( ross et al . 2007 ; okumura et al .",
    "2008 ; chuang & wang 2012 ; reid et al . 2012 ) , lyman - break galaxies ( da ngela et al .",

    "2009a ) , cross - correlation of galaxies and cluster of galaxies ( mountrichas et al .",
    "2009b ) , and voids ( sutter et al .",
    "2012 ) , among others .",
    "most of these authors analyzed the correlation on small scales ( @xmath84 @xmath85mpc ) and very few of them ( okumura et al .",
    "2008 ; chuang & wang 2012 ) use larger scales .",
    "let us suppose we have a survey completely covering some area with some homogeneous criterion .",
    "the method to calculate the anisotropic two - point correlation function is as follows .",
    "we generate another mock survey in the same area with a random ( poisson ) distribution of galaxies and with the same distribution of redshifts as the data .",
    "then we use a generalization of the landy & szalay ( 1993 ) algorithm to get the anisotropic two - point correlation function ,    @xmath86    @xmath87 where dd , rr , dr and rd are the number of data  data , random  random , data  random and random  data pairs , and",
    "@xmath88 denotes their normalization to data  data , i.e. , @xmath89 ; @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the total number of sources in the data and in the random sample ; @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the total number of sources in the data and in the random sample which contribute as first object in the pair for a given @xmath11 ( within some interval of redshifts ) .",
    "notice that @xmath94 and @xmath95 because we remove as first object of the pair the sources which are within an angular distance from a border of the survey lower than @xmath96 .",
    "consequently , dr is slightly different from rd : the parent galaxies ( the first character @xmath97 or @xmath98 ) are limited to a zone away from the borders of the selected area , whereas the second character includes all the galaxies of the catalog within a given distance from the parent source . in our case",
    ", we take a number of random points equal to the number of sources in the data . however , the result of the algorithm is independent of that number , provided that it is at least as large as the number of data points ( sylos labini et al .",
    "2009 ) and it is high enough to avoid the production of further noise due to sampling errors . the relative error of @xmath99 is equal to the inverse of the root square of the number of pairs ( betancort - rijo 1991 ; ross et al . 2007 ) but , since we manage a huge number of pairs both in the real data and in the random sample , this error is small in comparison to other errors .",
    "this number must not be very high in order to have a reasonable computation time to calculate the number of pairs .",
    "other estimators of the two - point correlation function give very similar results even at large scales ( e.g. , landy & szalay 1993 ; porciani & norberg 2006 ; ross et al .",
    "2007 ; sylos labini et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the error of @xmath50 is evaluated through a field - to - field method ( ross et al .",
    "2007 , section 2.4 ) : @xmath100 ^ 2 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath101 is the total number of subsamples ( fields ) , and the index @xmath102 indicates the statistics within the subsample @xmath102 . in our case , we take by default @xmath103 , dividing the covered region of the sky into 10 subregions .",
    "although landy & szalay ( 1993 ) claim that the error given by their estimator should be nearly poissonian , the poissonian error significantly underestimates the total error at large distances ( ross et al .",
    "2007 , section 2.4 ) .",
    "the jackknife or bootstrap methods provide errors of the same order ( ross et al .",
    "2007 , section 2.4 ) ; however , if there were important large - scale variations of the correlation , the jackknife or bootstrap algorithms would underestimate the total rms measured in the field - to - field algorithm ( lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "2010 ) . for point distributions",
    ", there is a component of the total error that is caused by the finiteness of the number of points ( betancort - rijo 1991 ) and is closely related to that given by the resampling techniques such as jackknife or bootstrap .",
    "the field - to - field fluctuations also include intrinsic fluctuations in the large - scale structure of galaxies .",
    "this technique of field - to - field is equivalent to carrying out several independent realizations , one for each of the subsamples in which is divided the whole , equivalent to analyzing the rms in multiple mock catalogs generated randomly , with the advantage that here we can be pretty sure that the generated subsamples obey perfectly the statistical distribution of the real sky since they are part of the whole real sky , whereas mock catalogs may depend on how the algorithm generates the samples .",
    "one may wonder whether the correlations between the different subsamples can change the rms of equation ( [ errxi ] ) with respect to the real one , i.e. , whether the terms of the covariance matrix are significant .",
    "the answer is that this effect is negligible provided that @xmath104 ( see appendix [ .2subsamples_tpcf ] ) , which is true in our case .",
    "therefore , the field - to - field algorithm seems an approximate method to take all the errors into account in a simple and direct way .",
    "using all available galaxies in a catalog would be better in order to gain higher signal - to - noise in the statistics , provided that the criterion of selection of sources does not vary with the position . in principle",
    ", this is possible for cosmological purposes , since cosmological parameters are totally independent of the evolution of galaxies or their clustering .",
    "the function @xmath16 will only depend on the cosmological model .",
    "also , @xmath16 does not depend on the kind of sources examined or the wavelength ; we can even mix different types of sources for different @xmath11 without @xmath105-corrections , so the selection effects ( malmquist bias and others ) will not have any influence on the result . in a limiting - magnitude survey covering some area , we will have more luminous sources at higher redshifts , different observed `` at - rest '' wavelengths , etc . , but it does not matter in the measurement of the geometry of the universe .",
    "nonetheless , one must take into account the effect of a variable @xmath106 in the calculation of the two - point correlation function .",
    "if the maximum comoving radius , @xmath28 , were very small , and the galaxies within a sphere of radius @xmath107 were similar in their properties , @xmath25 might be calculated as usual in a homogeneous space .",
    "but in our case , we must consider some effect of variation for larger @xmath28 due to the variability of @xmath106 within the considered effects , mainly because of the malmquist bias .",
    "this variability of the mean density produces a contribution to the two - point correlation function , which must be subtracted in order to see only the contribution from the clustering of galaxies .",
    "this correction is    @xmath108    where @xmath25 is the measured correlation , and @xmath109 is the correlation given by a random ( i.e. , uncorrelated , locally poisson ) distribution of sources within a field @xmath106 . in appendix [ .varrho ]",
    ", we demonstrate that , neglecting terms of @xmath110 with @xmath111 , @xmath112    this correction will be applied to our calculations .",

    "2013 ; dawson et al . 2013 ) will target , when finished , 1.5 million galaxies in ten thousand square degrees , @xmath113 , selected in color  magnitude space to be high - luminosity systems at large distances .",
    "the selection criteria are the union of two cuts designed to select targets in two different redshift intervals .",

    "these selection criteria produce a roughly constant comoving space density @xmath128 @xmath129mpc@xmath130 to @xmath131 with a slight peak at @xmath132 followed by a declining space density to @xmath133 .",
    "the average accuracy in the redshift determination of these sources is @xmath134 ( dawson et al .",
    "the survey has started in the fall of 2009 and is planned to be finished in approximately 2014 july . at present , we use the boss data release 10 version 5 to do statistical analyses of large - scale structure ( anderson et al .",
    "2012 ) with uniform coverage .",
    "some masks were applied to avoid regions with some saturated sources or low completeness ( anderson et al .",
    "this subsample contains 830,089 galaxies . in this sample",
    ", we use the galaxies within @xmath135 ( 793,573 galaxies ) . given the considerations in section [ .vardens ] , we do not need a homogeneous sample with respect to the variation in @xmath11 .",
    "some malmquist bias is expected to be introduced , even if the sources were selected to be kept almost constant for some range of redshifts , but our procedure can use samples with variable @xmath106 .",
    "nonetheless , in order to assure homogeneity in the angular scale and avoid border effects , we select as first object in pairs which contribute to the two - point correlation function only those of them whose circles of angular radii @xmath136 radians are totally covered ; indeed , for more security , we require them to be totally covered within a distance of @xmath137 in the sdss sample .",
    "thus , the number of parent galaxies ( first one of the galaxies in a pair for the correlation calculation ) is 456,451 .",
    "these are divided into three redshift bins , as is described in table [ tab : ybg ] .",
    "we also take into account that the minimum separation between fibers is sep@xmath138 radians , so we must add @xmath139 to the value of the mean @xmath51 for the lowest @xmath140 bin , which is negligible in our scales .",
    "previous analyses of the anisotropic correlation function with previous releases of boss data were also carried out by white et al .",

    "( 2012 ) , although with different scales , methods and purposes from the present paper .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we observe in table [ tab : chi2 ] that some @xmath141 are much lower than unity for @xmath142 , more than would be expected statistically .",
    "this indicates two things : ( 1 ) the previously mentioned fact that the 18 points are not totally independent , and ( 2 ) the well - known fact that the scientific community tends to publish results with a dispersion much lower than expected statistically from the error bars , which means that either the error bars were overestimated , or there is a bias in the publication of results towards the preferred value ( croft & dailey 2011 ) .",
    "we also find some probabilities which are lower than 0.05 ( excluded at a 95% cl ) or even lower than 0.01 ( excluded at a 99% cl ) .",

    "we see that the probabilities are very low for some cases in the subsamples of 11 points or the whole sample of 18 points ; the subsample of 7 points is not conclusive but it shows the same trends in the probabilities , which indicates that the exclusion of some cosmological models is robust .",
    "the application of the alcock  paczyski test using the anisotropic two - point correlation function was shown here to be a useful tool for discriminating among different cosmological models without any a priori assumptions .",
    "we have seen that the major caveat is the disentanglement with the redshift distortions produced by the peculiar velocities of gravitational infall , but it is still possible to separate both effects .",
    "the error bars are large for the determination of the ratio of observed angular size to radial / redshift size , @xmath16 ; however , with large collections of data from many surveys , it is possible to get some constraints in cosmological models .",
    "we have applied our method to three surveys within sdss : galaxies from sdss - iii / boss , and qsos from both sdss - ii and sdss - iii / boss .",
    "we have not used the survey of galaxies from sdss - ii because most of their galaxies are at @xmath145 , and the condition of completeness within a radius @xmath136 would reduce enormously the sample of parent galaxies , producing a result much poorer than with boss galaxies .",
    "the alternative of exploring smaller distances in the correlation would alleviate this constraint of completeness areas ; however , it would introduce the problem of the `` fingers of god '' , which we have not taken into account here because they are expected to produce a negligible effect at the scales we were using .",
    "furthermore , we have used some estimations of @xmath16 given directly or indirectly by the literature , leading to the results in table [ tab : chi2 ] or in figure [ fig : models2 ] .",
    "we observe that there are four cosmological models excluded within @xmath1% cl : einstein  de sitter , open ",
    "friedman cosmology without dark energy , flat quasi - steady - state cosmology ( qssc ) , and a static universe with a linear hubble law .",
    "two models fit the data with a higher probability : concordance cosmology , and static universe with tired light redshift .    for the standard concordance model ( @xmath146 ) ,",
    "we have set constraints on @xmath2 to produce a better fit to the data ; they are : @xmath3 , which is in agreement with values derived from other independent methods .",
    "note , however , that , since we have not used any a priori assumptions , neither about the redshift distortion model nor other constraints including other data , the error bars here are larger than those derived from other methods  e.g .",
    ", a recent analysis of cmbr data with _ planck",
    "_ gives @xmath147 ( planck collaboration 2013 ) .",
    "if we also allow a free value for the equation of state of the dark energy , @xmath148 , instead of a fixed value of -1 , we get as a best fit : @xmath149 , @xmath150 . certainly , our method here is not the best one to explore the possible values of the cosmological parameters once the cosmology is established ; this could be much improved with further constraints , as ross et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and okumura et al .",
    "( 2008 ) did , but this was not our goal in this paper .",
    "we have focused on a method to test cosmological models without any a priori assumption .",
    "the qssc model is excluded at a @xmath1% cl , but the fit is better ( excluded with a probability of 98.0% instead of 99.56% ) with parameters @xmath151 and @xmath152 , which lead to @xmath153 .",
    "this is compatible with the previously established value for the @xmath154-field density of @xmath155 ( banerjee & narlikar 1999 , with the angular redshift test ) or @xmath156 ( banerjee et al .",
    "2000 , with sne data ) .",
    "the main problem with these fitted values is that they lead to the maximum redshift of an observable galaxy at @xmath157 , and we know there are galaxies beyond that .",
    "anyway , a flat qssc appears to have a very low probability to be a valid model according to only the present analysis .",
    "all these considerations are for a flat qssc universe ; if we allowed curvature ( @xmath158 ) , a wider range of probabilities could be obtained .",
    "the static models are not totally excluded from the present analysis .",
    "the one with a linear hubble law is excluded ( assuming , as we did , that the linear regime applies and that the peculiar velocity of the galaxies is irrotational , i.e. , with zero vorticity , as predicted by the usual gravitational growth theories ) , but not the one with tired - light hypothesis to explain the redshift .",
    "this tired - light model is also supported by some other tests , such as the angular size test ( lpez - corredoira 2010 ; laviolette 2012 ,  7.4 ) or differential galaxy number counts versus magnitude ( laviolette 2012 ,  7.7 ) .",
    "fitting the hubble diagram as @xmath159 , with @xmath160 being the luminosity distance , is not good with sne data using a `` simple '' tired light assumption ( where @xmath161 ; the factor @xmath162 stems from the fact that the luminosity is proportional to @xmath163 and is inversely proportional to @xmath164 due to the redshift without expansion , i.e. , without time dilation ) .",
    "however , the fit is acceptable using a `` plasma '' tired light redshift ( @xmath165 ; lpez - corredoira 2010 ) , and it is quite good with gamma - ray bursts even up to @xmath166 with a tired - light model of type @xmath167 ( marosi 2013 ) .",
    "future spectroscopic surveys with significantly more sources , coverage , and depth , will be able to improve the present results .",
    "in particular , at high redshift we still have few spectroscopic qsos , so the error bars are large ( see how noisy the correlations are in figs . [",
    "fig : elipses2q ] , [ fig : elipses2q2 ] ) .",
    "one exception is the point from da ngela et al .",
    "( 2005b ) at @xmath168 : @xmath169 ( note , however , that , looking at figure 5 of da ngela et al .",
    "( 2005b ) , one could say that @xmath170 is quite likely within 1@xmath75 , and consequently the error bars might be somewhat larger ) .",
    "as it can be observed in figure [ fig : models ] , accurate values of @xmath63 at @xmath171 will be able to discern between the two successful cosmological models in this paper : @xmath0cdm ( concordance ) and static model with tired - light redshift . also",
    ", very accurate measurements of @xmath63 at low @xmath11 would be able to test which one is the correct , since @xmath23 for the concordance model , whereas @xmath172 for the tired - light one .",
    "it is also worth noting that the most important contribution stems from the already available data from previous analyses of the anisotropic correlation function , combining the results of six references .",
    "the contribution of the data ( @xmath143 ) analyzed in this paper does not change significantly the confidence levels of exclusion of the different cosmological models because we get higher error bars .",
    "note , however , that we can not guarantee that the results of those six references with somewhat lower error bars are correct . in principle , from the experience developing this paper , the conclusion that comes up is that the quasi - degeneracy between the values of @xmath54 and @xmath63 for the fit of @xmath50 is a severe problem which produces huge error bars of @xmath63 and , consequently , the alcock & paczyski method only becomes powerful when we join the results from different surveys .",

    "the values most used are @xmath212 , @xmath217 , @xmath218 , and @xmath219 ( banerjee et al .",
    "2000 ; narlikar et al . 2002 ; vishwakarma 2002 ; narlikar et al . 2007 ) , which imply @xmath220 and @xmath156 , but i avoid them because they do not allow galaxies to be fitted with @xmath221 .",
    "parameters with a curvature different from zero ( @xmath158 ) also give results that are very close in the angular size test ( banerjee & narlikar 1999 ) .",
    "static euclidean model with linear hubble law for all redshifts : @xmath222 , @xmath223",
    "@xmath224 @xmath225 + these simple relations indicate that redshift is always proportional to angular distance , i.e. , a hubble law .",
    "we assume in this scenario that the universe is static .",
    "the caveat is to explain the mechanism as different from the expansion or the doppler effect , which gives rise to the redshift .",
    "this cosmological model is not a solution that has been explored theoretically or mathematically .",
    "however , from a phenomenological point of view , we can consider this relationship between distance and redshift as an ad hoc extrapolation from the observed dependence on the low - redshift universe .",
    "tired - light static euclidean model : @xmath222 , @xmath226 + @xmath227 + @xmath228 .\\ ] ] + for very low @xmath11 , @xmath229 + this is again a possible ad hoc phenomenological representation which stems from considering that the photons lose energy along their paths due to some interaction , and the relative loss of energy is proportional to the length of that path ( e.g. laviolette 1986 ; brynjolfsson 2004a , section 5.8 ; ashmore 2011 ; laviolette 2012 , section 7.3 ) , i.e. , @xmath230 .",
    "given two rectangular adjacent regions where we want to calculate the two - point correlation function of parent objects embedded in each region within an angular distance @xmath10 , we want to calculate the number of common pairs in both subsamples .",
    "both regions have a width , @xmath231 , and height , @xmath232 , and they are in contact through the vertical divisory line , as shown in figure [ fig:2subsamples_tpcf ] .",
    "given any parent source in the left box at any height with completely covered circle , the probability that the second object of the pair within an angular distance @xmath10 is in the right box is : @xmath233 where @xmath234 is the fraction of the circle in the right box , according to figure [ fig:2subsamples_tpcf ] : @xmath235@xmath236 hence , @xmath237    therefore , the number of common pairs separated by an angular distance @xmath10 is @xmath238 .",
    "this gives us the degree of dependence of the calculation of the two - point correlation function in both adjacent subsamples .    if we took the horizontal direction as the right ascension and the vertical direction as the declination ( as will be done in this paper ) , and the whole sky is divided into @xmath101 subsamples , each pair of adjacent subsamples would have an average @xmath239 .",
    "the subregions would not be rectangular but slices of constant r.a .",
    "width ; this can be translated into an average @xmath240 ( @xmath241 stems from @xmath242 ) .",
    "thus , the average number of common pairs in adjacent regions would be @xmath243 for @xmath244 , there are only common pairs among the adjacent subsamples , not with the regions that are not in contact ; therefore if we select two random subsamples , the probability of a pair to have a common pair in both subsamples is @xmath245 multiplied by a factor @xmath246 ( 2 is the number of adjacent regions , and @xmath247 are the total number of subsamples except the first selected one ) .",
    "we neglect the pairs near the polar caps , which are very few in comparison with the rest of the pairs ; in the application of the present paper , there are no sdss galaxies near the polar cap so their contribution is almost null .",
    "therefore , the degree of correlation among subsamples ( which would generate some terms in the covariance matrix ) is roughly ( we approximate @xmath248 for high values of @xmath101 ) @xmath249 an amount which is much lower than the one for low @xmath10 ; it can be considered negligible ( @xmath250 ) for @xmath251 .",
    "from the definition , a poisson distribution of sources with constant mean density in the space gives a null two - point correlation function .",
    "but if there is some variation of the mean density with redshift , even locally preserving the random / poisson distribution of sources , it will give a non - null contribution :"
