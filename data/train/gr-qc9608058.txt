    "the main aim of this paper is to provide a detailed interpretative investigation of the vacuum plane - symmetric spacetimes of general relativity .",
    "some generic motivating reasons may be adduced for that .",
    "firstly , the presence of so - called topological defects ( monopoles , cosmic strings , domain walls and textures ) , arising from cosmological phase transitions ( symmetry breaking ) , have become quite fashionable in the study of the very early universe , particularly as concerns their deep consequences for large - scale structure formation and cosmic background radiation anisotropies@xcite-@xcite .",
    "all these objects have peculiar gravitational properties ; generic walls or shells ( and also textures , to that effect ) , however , seem to have a slightly more acceptable ( mathematical ) behavior in the sense that , contrarily to one- or two - dimensional trapped regions , their spacetimes can be described by curvature tensors well defined as mathematical distributions@xcite .    secondly , the casimir effect associated with the vacuum bounded by two infinite parallel plates , when treated in a fully consistent way , should take into account the proper gravitational field of the plates @xcite . in this setting , it turns out to be an issue for quantum field theory in curved spacetime .",
    "thirdly , when trying to formalize , in a more precise way , the equivalence between inertial and gravitational effects , the problem of what the general relativistic model of a spatially homogeneous gravitational field is has to be faced .",
    "its resolution , from a naive newtonian point of view , suggests again the paying attention to the vacuum plane - symmetric solutions of einstein s field equations . of course , the determination of the newtonian gravitational field outside a static , infinite , uniformly dense planar slab is a trivial exercise ; however , as we shall see , the general relativistic situation is not so plain .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : psv ] , we expose the properties of taub s plane - symmetric vacuum model : isometries , singularity , kinematics of the observers adapted to the symmetries , timelike and null geodesics ( including geodesic deviation for timelike ones ) .",
    "these aspects have already been dealt with in the literature@xcite-@xcite ; however , not only for the sake of completeness and fixing conventions , but also for further clarification and generalization do we delve again into them . in sec .",
    "[ sec : boundaries ] , we study the asymptotic structure as well as the newtonian limit . in sec .  [",
    "sec : junction ] , we prove that taub s global solution is the limit of the mirror - symmetric matching of two taub domains , to the `` left '' and `` right '' of a negative mass planar shell . in sec .  [",
    "sec : discussion ] , we discuss the main implications of our results and present a conclusion .",
    "we also provide an appendix where the plane - symmetric vacuum solutions are shown , via cartan s invariant technique , to be parametric limits of a generalized schwarzschild family of spacetimes .    the signature of the metric , except for sec .",
    "[ sec : junction ] , is @xmath0 ; also @xmath1 .",
    "[ sec : psv ]      einstein s _ vacuum _ field equations , without cosmological term , for a plane - symmetric geometry , will be satisfied by only three distinct _ single _ ( without any essential constants of integration ) solutions@xcite : taub s static metric , kasner s spatially homogeneous , and minkowski metric .    * taub s geometry ( t ) : @xmath2 with coordinate ranges @xmath3 * kasner s geometry ( k ) : @xmath4 with coordinate ranges @xmath5    the similarity of taub s and kasner s geometries to rindler s and milne s universes , respectively , is to be noticed .",
    "the coordinate ranges for taub s and kasner s models given above are those where the solutions are regular . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the only nonvanishing carminati - mclenaghan algebraic invariants@xcite for taub s and kasner s solutions are : @xmath6 and @xmath7   + where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "as concerns taub s solution , we call attention to the following properties : ( i )  it is _ curved _ ; ( ii )  it is not only plane - symmetric , but also _ static _ ; ( iii )  it has a timelike singularity at @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) ; ( iv )  its algebraic invariants vanish when @xmath12 ( suggesting it is asymptotically flat at spatial infinity in the @xmath13 direction ; cf . sec .",
    "[ sec : boundaries ] ) .",
    "kasner s solution presents the `` dual '' properties : ( i )  it is also _ curved _ ; ( ii )  it is not only plane - symmetric , but also _ spatially homogeneous _",
    "( beware : it is _ not _ stationary ! ) ; ( iii )  it has a spacelike singularity at @xmath14 ; ( iv )  its algebraic invariants vanish when @xmath15 .      the motion of the observers adapted to those coordinate systems @xmath16 @xmath17 is covariantly characterized by the kinematic quantities@xcite : acceleration @xmath18 , expansion @xmath19 , shear @xmath20 and vorticity @xmath21 . for the models under consideration , we have only the following nonvanishing quantities @xmath22    @xmath23    we see that the adapted observers of taub s , eq .",
    "( [ taub ] ) , solutions constitute a _ rigid nonrotating accelerated frame _ , whereas those of kasner s , eq .",
    "( [ kasner ] ) , solutions constitute a _ deforming nonrotating geodesic frame_. the results for taub s observers are obvious since they are manifestly static ( i.e. , their four - velocities are proportional to irrotational timelike killing vector fields of the respective geometries ) , so that they remain at rest with respect to one another and with respect to the singularity too .",
    "this is a consequence of the physically more intuitive fact that the proper time , as measured by a static observer , for a photon to travel to and back from a second static observer is independent of the emission event .",
    "half this proper time defines the so - called _ radar distance _ between the two observers , which is a coordinate - independent concept .",
    "specifically , for taub s spacetime , this radar distance between two static observers @xmath24 and @xmath25 with respective spatial coordinates @xmath26 and @xmath27 , as measured by @xmath24 , is given by @xmath28 as explicitly displayed , this radar distance is _ not _ symmetric , a feature which already happens to rindler s observers in minkowski spacetime and is due to the relativity of the simultaneity for the different instantaneous inertial frames attached to each observer .",
    "we also notice that , as the radial coordinate distance @xmath29 to show that free particles are `` repelled '' from the singularity .",
    "the lagrangian for the geodesics of metric ( [ taub - r ] ) is    @xmath30 ,     \\label{lagrangian}\\ ] ]    where a dot denotes a derivative with respect to an affine parameter @xmath31 ( the proper time , for timelike geodesics ) .",
    "we have exactly three linearly independent killing vector fields , so that the corresponding canonical momenta are conserved :    @xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    furthermore , the invariance of the character of the geodesic ( @xmath35 , for null or timelike geodesics , respectively ) implies now    @xmath36    with    @xmath37    and    @xmath38    the motion in the coordinate @xmath39 is thus reduced to a usual one - dimensional problem with the _ effective potential _ ( [ effpot ] ) and _ r coordinate _ acceleration @xmath40 from either ( [ charinv])([parmom ] ) or ( [ parmom]),([r - accel ] ) , we see that we have two qualitatively distinct cases , according to the mass and@xmath41or the initial conditions of the test particle : ( a )  massless particles in purely `` perpendicular '' motion ( @xmath42 ) ; ( b )  massive particles ( @xmath43 ) or massless particles in `` transverse '' motion ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "case ( a ) implies @xmath45 . these null geodesics _",
    "do _ attain the singularity .",
    "case ( b ) implies @xmath46 when @xmath47 and @xmath48 when @xmath49 .",
    "these geodesics can _ never attain _ the singularity .",
    "in fact , _ all _ massive geodesic particles or even generic ( @xmath50 ) massless geodesic particles are _ repelled _ from the singularity as described by the static observers @xmath51 .",
    "this is clear from the following . as shown at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : metrics ] , the static observers are at rest with respect to each other and with respect to the singularity . since the @xmath39 coordinate for a geodesic particle eventually increases without bound , it will cross the static observers receding further and further away from the singularity .",
    "furthermore , a geodesic particle initially at rest will be displaced to increasing values of @xmath39 , as can be derived from ( [ r - accel ] ) .",
    "this implies that , relative to the static observers , a geodesic particle is accelerated away from the singularity .",
    "this description is consistent with the negative mass interpretation for the sources of taub s spacetime , as discussed at the end of this subsection , in the appendix and in sec .",
    "[ sec : junction ] .",
    "case ( a ) above can be further examined by the trivial integration of ( [ charinv ] ) , taking into account that @xmath52 : @xmath53 here we have chosen the initial condition @xmath54 . replacing ( [ purperp - r ] ) into ( [ energy ] ) , ( [ xmom ] ) and ( [ ymom ] ) allows us to determine the remaining parametric equations of these geodesics : @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 with the choice @xmath58 .",
    "these null geodesics may reach the boundaries @xmath59 ( to be defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : boundaries ] ) , but , as we see from ( [ purperp - r ] ) , they take an infinite interval of affine parameter to reach them .    the case of massive particles ( @xmath43 ) in purely `` perpendicular '' motion ( @xmath60 ) is also easily dealt with as regards the ( inverse ) parametric equation of motion for the coordinate @xmath39 , leading to @xmath61 where , again , @xmath62 and the @xmath63 sign corresponds to the outgoing motion and the @xmath64 sign to the incoming one .",
    "these results will be useful presently ( cf . secs .",
    "[ sec : boundaries ] and [ sec : junction ] ) .    to further interpret the model ,",
    "let us now calculate , from the geodesic deviation equation , the relative acceleration between two geodesics at instantaneous rest with respect to the singularity ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "we find @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 note that the signs in the above equations are the opposite of the corresponding ones in the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "thus , a set of two freely falling particles released from rest ( as just described above ) may behave in two characteristic ways : ( a )  if their initial spatial positions have equal @xmath69 and @xmath70 but different @xmath39 , their relative distance will instantaneously decrease , while being repelled from the singularity ; ( b )  if their initial spatial positions have equal @xmath39 but different @xmath69 and/or @xmath70 , their relative distance will instantaneously increase , while being repelled from the singularity again .",
    "contrary to the case of the curvature field being spatially homogeneous ( independent of @xmath39 ) , as occurs in the newtonian theory for the gravitational field * g * , the plane symmetry of the metric field does not imply homogeneity ( neither in the metric nor the curvature fields ) : analogous space - time measurements ( such as those for the geodesic deviation ) at events with different @xmath39 coordinates furnish distinct results .      some intuition on the nature of the source ( singularity ) of taub s ( global ) spacetime might also be expected to arise from a study of the families of metrics to which it belongs .",
    "the problem with this argument is twofold : ( i )  a given metric may be a parametric limit of several disjoint families of metrics , ( ii )  a given family of metrics may have different limits , for the same limiting values of its parameters , when the limiting process is carried out in different coordinate systems .",
    "this has been first pointed out by geroch@xcite , who presented schwarzschild s metric in three different coordinate systems , such that , as the mass tends to @xmath71 , the limiting result is either singular , minkowski s metric or kasner s ( spatially homogeneous ) metric .",
    "due to the resemblance between kasner s and taub s metrics , one naturally wonders whether the latter is also a limit of the schwarzschild family of metrics as the mass tends to @xmath71 ; the answer , however , is negative , since the only petrov type d such limits are minkowski s and kasner s ( spatially homogeneous ) spacetimes@xcite .",
    "still , coordinate systems exist , for this schwarzschild family of metrics , such that , now in the limit @xmath72 , one ends up with taub s metric@xcite . in the appendix",
    ", we analyze a generalized schwarzschild family of metrics , which family is closed in the sense of geroch @xcite .",
    "this analysis is carried out by means of cartan scalars , which characterize a given geometry independently of coordinate systems , and the above results are explicitly derived in an invariat way and also cast in a wider context .",
    "it is expedient to mention here some other families to which taub s metric belongs .",
    "first , we have two subfamilies of weyl s static vacuum metrics@xcite : the levi - civita metrics and the parnovski - papadopoulos metrics",
    ". then we have the generalized kasner metrics@xcite .",
    "finally , also the robinson - trautman vacuum solutions@xcite and the kerr - schild solutions@xcite .",
    "in this section , we introduce coordinate systems which render explicit the null boundary structure of the spacetime and also characterize a weak field limit to taub s geometry .",
    "let us consider the static plane - symmetric taub metric in the form @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) and introduce in the manifold of ( [ tds2 ] ) the kruskal - type coordinate system ( @xmath75 ) defined in table 1",
    ".    in this coordinate system , the metric ( [ tds2 ] ) assumes the form @xmath76 we note that the curvature tensor of ( [ ds2 t ] ) tends continuously to zero as @xmath77 .",
    "asymptotic coordinates may be introduced such that ( [ ds2 t ] ) becomes regular on @xmath78 ( cf .",
    "table 1 ) .",
    "the boundaries @xmath78 are in fact two flat null surfaces at infinity ( @xmath59 ) , which we shall denote by @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( cf .",
    "[ i1 ] ) , and correspond to the asymptotically flat regions of the spacetime .",
    "if , in ( [ tds2 ] ) , we extend the domain of the coordinate @xmath39 to @xmath81 , the resulting manifold of the geometry ( [ tds2 ] ) is the union of a kasner ( k ) spacetime to a taub ( t ) spacetime , with the singular locus @xmath11 as a common boundary .",
    "the kasner spacetime corresponds to the domain @xmath82 , its singularity @xmath11 having now a spacelike character .",
    "a typical plane @xmath83 of kasner s spacetime is represented in fig .",
    "the metric in k is given by @xmath84 expression ( [ ds2k ] ) is obtained by interchanging @xmath85 and @xmath86 in the metric components of ( [ ds2 t ] ) .",
    "note that in the k region @xmath87 , and @xmath83 are still timelike and spacelike coordinates , respectively .",
    "a further coordinate system is now introduced ( cf .",
    "table 1 ) , which will be useful in examining the asymptotic form of taub s metric . in the coordinate system @xmath88 ,",
    "taub s geometry ( [ ds2 t ] ) assumes the form @xmath89    and kasner s geometry ( [ ds2k ] ) becomes , @xmath90 the null infinities of taub s geometry are now expressed by @xmath91 and analogously for kasner s geometry .",
    "the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ i4 ] make explicit the relation between the @xmath83 and @xmath92 coordinates .",
    "although we have introduced coordinate systems ( cf .",
    "table  [ coordinates ] ) where the asymptotic boundaries of taub s geometry are characterized and explicitly exhibited ( the two flat null infinities @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and the spatial infinity @xmath95 ) , the metric in these coordinate systems is not well defined in the boundaries . in order to give a regular expression for taub s metric in a neighborhood of the boundaries @xmath93 and @xmath94 , we therefore introduce two new sets of asymptotic coordinates ( cf . table 1 ) .",
    "we rewrite ( [ ds2tg ] ) as @xmath96 near @xmath93 we have @xmath97 , and we may expand the above line element as @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 we note that the line element @xmath101 is the minkowski one in coordinates @xmath102 . indeed ,",
    "let us realize a further coordinate transformation ( cf .",
    "table 1 ) , which casts @xmath101 into the form @xmath103 and all components of @xmath104 in this new coordinate system are at least @xmath105 , as well as its first and second derivatives .",
    "therefore , in the coordinate system @xmath106 the metric near @xmath93 is regular , as well as its first and second order derivatives , and differ from the minkowski metric by a small perturbation @xmath104 which tends to zero as @xmath107 .",
    "an analogous expansion may be realized in a neighborhood of @xmath94 : @xmath108 .",
    "this may be obtained from the expressions of the above paragraph by the obvious substitution @xmath109 .",
    "we can now discuss the weak field limit for taub s geometry .",
    "equation ( [ gmm ] ) suggests the introduction of a cartesian coordinate system at infinity , namely , @xmath110 , defined in table 1 .",
    "thus , when @xmath111 for finite @xmath112 , we have @xmath107 and @xmath113 , with @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , the region described by @xmath115 for finite @xmath112 is a neighborhood of the spatial infinity @xmath95 of fig .",

    "this configuration of the gravitational field ( in a neighborhood of @xmath95 ) is the nearest to a homogeneous gravitational field we may achieve in the static plane - symmetric taub geometry . in the past literature , this problem of the nonrelativistic limit to a static plane - symmetric metric was considered in ( * ? ? ?",
    "the treatment there is , however , incomplete : a coordinate system is introduced where taub s metric is put in the form @xmath127 , where @xmath104 is a small ( in a specific region ) deviation of the minkowski metric , @xmath101 .",
    "nevertheless , the connection and curvature tensor components are not small ( of the order of @xmath104 ) in that region , unless he specifies that @xmath128 , thus fixing the asymptotic region ( @xmath129 ) as the region of true nonrelativistic limit ; in this case , the above coordinate system is well defined only in the asymptotic region ( cf .",
    "* eq .  ( 12 ) ) ) .",
    "furthermore , since taub s metric has no essential free parameter in it , there simply does not exist a quantity which would play the role of the mass density of the source .",
    "[ sec : junction ]    we now implement a _ mirror - symmetric _ junction of two taub domains by means of a _ negative _ mass shell , in order to show that taub s original spacetime ( [ taub ] ) may be naturally viewed as the limit of this matched one as the surface energy density of the shell approaches @xmath130 . to this end",
    ", we shall take advantage of israel s shell formalism @xcite , following all his conventions inclusively ; in particular , the signature of the metric , in this section , is + 2 .",
    "the four - dimensional manifolds @xmath131 and @xmath132 will be taken as taub domains ; specifically , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , that is @xmath131 is `` on the right side '' of the original taub singularity and @xmath132 is `` on its left side '' .",
    "we are assuming that the @xmath135 surfaces have the topology of a plane ( * r*@xmath136 ) and we can thus assign to the symmetry @xmath137 a natural meaningful interpretation as a mirror or specular symmetry .",
    "this interpretation seems to be unwarranted for other choices of topology of the @xmath138 surfaces ( cf .  sec .",

    "( [ taub ] ) ] identical : @xmath144 thus automatically satisfying the first junction condition .",
    "the verification of the second junction condition requires the calculation of the extrinsic curvatures of @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "the unit normal vector to @xmath145 ( directed from @xmath132 to @xmath131 ) will have components @xmath146 and @xmath147 , relative to the charts @xmath148 and @xmath149 , given by @xmath150    for an intrinsic basis of tangent vectors to @xmath145 , we will choose three orthonormal vectors * e*@xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) of components @xmath153 and @xmath154 , relative to the charts @xmath148 and @xmath149 , given by @xmath155    the extrinsic curvature of a hypersurface with unit normal @xmath156 can be calculated as @xmath157 which furnishes @xmath158    lanczos equation @xcite , @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the jump in the extrinsic curvature , then determines the surface energy - momentum tensor of a shell : @xmath161    thus , if we suppose the shell is a perfect fluid one , with proper four - velocity @xmath162 we are forced to recognize that it has a _ negative _ surface energy density .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath163 approaches @xmath164 , thus realizing the matching ever closer to the original taub singularity , we are naturally lead to interpreting it as an infinite uniform _ plane _ distribution of negative diverging surface energy density .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the repulsion of geodesics found in sec .",
    "[ sec : geodesics ] and the limit for infinite negative mass .",
    "in this paper , we carried out an extensive investigation of the local and global properties of taub s ( static ) geometry , and by extension , of kasner s ( spatially homogeneous ) geometry",
    ". first , we studied the geodesic motion , by using the method of the effective potential .",
    "we showed , in a manifestly coordinate - independent way , that massive ( @xmath43 ) free particles eventually recede from the singular locus , no matter what initial conditions are attributed to them . only massless ( @xmath165 )",
    "particles can attain the singularity , even so provided their motion is purely `` perpendicular '' ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "this enlarges upon some results in the literature@xcite .",
    "second , we showed that taub s metric is one of the limits of a family of schwarzschild s spacetimes , which is closed in the sense of geroch@xcite .",
    "this limit corresponds to the mass parameter approaching infinitely negative values .",
    "this analysis is carried out by means of cartan scalars , which characterize in an invariant way a given geometry .",
    "third , we built several new plane - symmetric models , by conveniently matching taub , rindler ( minkowski ) and kasner domains .",
    "fourth , we also uncovered the asymptotic structure ( null , timelike and spacelike infinities ) of taub s solution .",
    "fifth , we obtained the complete weak field limit in asymptotically flat regions , proving that , at spatial infinity , we may have a nonrelativistic approximately homogeneous configuration ; however , this can not be associated to a truly newtonian limit due to the absence of any essential parameters which could be related to the mass density of the source or , in other words , taub s solution is a single one , not a family of solutions ( like schwarzschild s one , for instance ) .",
    "we will now take the opportunity to make some generic comments on related current literature .    in a recent paper@xcite",
    ", bonnor discusses the difficulties which arise in the interpretation of the solutions of einstein s field equations , due to the coordinate freedom to describe the metric .",
    "although we agree with this general idea of his papers , we do not believe that his preferred ( semi - infinite line mass ) interpretation of taub s vacuum static plane symmetric metric is the _ only _ tenable one .",
    "indeed , locally isometric manifolds can be extended to global manifolds with distinct topological properties ; this extension can not be fixed by purely local ( in a given coordinate system ) considerations ( isometries , geodesics , etc . ) , which are doomed to inconclusiveness .",
    "for instance , the @xmath167 flat maximally symmetric surfaces of ( [ taub ] ) can be conceived of as immersed in * r*@xmath168 either as topological planes or topological cylinders , which are , of course , locally indistinguishable .",
    "what does really seems promising , from the physical point of view , to settle the issue of interpretation is the realization of experiments which probe the large - scale structure of the spacetime .",
    "another criterion , one of simplicity , we have advanced is the _ mirror - symmetric _ matching of sec .",
    "[ sec : junction ] , which reproduces the global taub solution in the limit of infinitely negative surface energy density of the plane shell .",
    "in short , it seems to us that the nature of the source , from a purely mathematical point of view , is a matter of _ consistent choice _ of topology .",
    "we should not conclude without recalling an elegant heuristic argument of vilenkin@xcite , which might explain the unreasonableness of looking for a physically viable model for an infinite plane of constant positive surface density @xmath169 .",
    "consider , in the alleged plane , a disk of radius @xmath170 , which contains the total mass @xmath171 ; thus , above a critical radius , given by @xmath172 , the disk will have more mass than its corresponding schwarzschild mass , and it should collapse ( incidentally , the same argument does not hold for a line or string ! ) .",
    "of course , compelling as this argument seems , its validity rests on , at least , two tacit assumptions : ( i )  the intrinsic geometry of the plane is euclidean , so that the disk s area is @xmath173 , ( ii )  the _ hoop conjecture_@xcite , since we are dealing with a nonspherically symmetric system .",
    "vilenkin s argument might then explain why all the proposed models in gr for an infinite homogeneous plane end up with either a flat space solution with an appropriate topology or a constant distribution of _ negative _ mass . in fact , in the literature , there have appeared two distinct proposals for the general relativistic problem of a static , infinite , uniformly dense plane .",
    "the first one@xcite is locally isometric to taub s plane - symmetric static vacuum spacetime ; the second one@xcite is a rindler domain , locally isometric to the minkowski spacetime .",
    "if we insist that a plane massive configuration may exist in gr , we must cope with the possibility of negative mass configurations , with an exterior solution given by taub s geometry .    as a last remark ,",
    "one might be tempted to consider the models inspected in this paper as purely academic ones ; however , already in nonquantum gravitational theory , the issue of negative mass has a longstanding history , of which a relativistic landmark is afforded by bondi s classic paper@xcite .",
    "also , from a quantum point of view , it was early recognized that the weak energy condition can not hold everywhere@xcite .",
    "nowadays , this result has acquired a renewed interest because , besides the already mentioned cosmological interest of topological defects@xcite-@xcite , of its import to the possibility of construction of time machines @xcite and avoidance of singularities @xcite .",

    "since @xmath197 is not present in the cartan scalars , once @xmath178 is given and a solution for @xmath197 of the corresponding vacuum condition is found , any other solution with the same @xmath178 can be transformed in this first one by a suitable coordinate transformation .",
    "thus , the line element is determined by the values of @xmath178 and @xmath179 only . moreover , since @xmath189 depends on the @xmath39 coordinate , by a suitable coordinate transformation , its dependence on @xmath179 can be eliminated .",
    "thus , a member of this family of metrics is characterized by the sign of @xmath179 , i.e. , @xmath198 and the combination @xmath191 of @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "therefore , one can always make a coordinate transformation such that @xmath178 becomes @xmath199 , @xmath164 or @xmath200 and @xmath201 , @xmath199 or @xmath202 , respectively .",
    "accordingly , the generalized schwarzschild family may be divided into the following sub - families :    one can make @xmath203 and @xmath204 , corresponding to the schwarzschild line element with @xmath205 .",
    "one can make @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "this we shall call the anti - schwarzschild line element with @xmath205 .",
    "one can make @xmath208 .",
    "the factor @xmath191 becomes zero .",
    "therefore the only parameter is the sign of @xmath179 and its absolute value can always be made equal to @xmath209 ( for @xmath210 the line element becomes singular ) .",
    "one can make @xmath211 leading to a single metric , namely kasner s one , ( [ kasner - r ] ) . from ( [ ec ] ) , the cartan scalars are @xmath212 one can make @xmath213 leading to a single metric , namely taub s one , ( [ taub - r ] ) . from ( [ ec ] ) , the cartan scalars are @xmath214 the last two line elements are special cases of the kasner - type metric @xcite , @xmath215 , where @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "to recover ( [ eckasner ] ) we may choose @xmath219 , @xmath220 , @xmath221 and @xmath222 ; and to recover ( [ ectaub ] ) we may choose @xmath219 , @xmath220 , @xmath221 and @xmath223 .",
    "therefore , the generalized schwarzschild family ( [ ds2 ] ) may be divided into two one - parameter families , namely the schwarzschild family and the anti - schwarzschild family plus the kasner metric ( [ kasner - r ] ) and the taub metric ( [ taub - r ] ) . the analysis of the cartan scalars shows some interesting features of the parameters and functions appearing in the original line element ( [ ds2 ] ) . as concerns taub s metric , we showed that it is a particular case of the generalized schwarzschild family with @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "although the parameter @xmath179 is still arbitrary , it can be absorbed away by a coordinate transformation and taub s geometry is thus independent of parameters : it is a _ single _ solution , not a family .",
    "a consequence of this fact emerges in the weak field limit ( [ phi ] ) , which has no essential parameter .    from the cartan scalars ( [ ec ] ) , we see that , as @xmath226 , the limits depend only on the sign of @xmath179 and not on @xmath178 , therefore the schwarzschild and the anti - schwarzschild families have the same limits .",
    "the limiting procedure we adopt is that of @xcite , where we choose limits for @xmath189 and find the limits of the other cartan scalars .",
    "the possible limits for @xmath189 are ( i ) @xmath164 , ( ii ) a nonzero constant and ( iii ) an arbitrary function of the coordinates .",
    "( i ) if @xmath227 , then all cartan scalars ( [ ec ] ) tend to zero , therefore both families tend to minkowski spacetime ( which is petrov type 0 ) .",
    "( ii ) as discussed by @xcite , petrov type d metrics can not have @xmath189 constant while the other components of the weyl spinor are zero .",
    "( iii ) if @xmath189 tends to an arbitrary function of the coordinates , then as @xmath228 both families tend to the kasner metric ( [ kasner - r ] ) and as @xmath229 both families tend to the taub ( [ taub - r ] ) as can be easily seen comparing the the cartan scalars obtained in the limit with those of kasner ( [ eckasner ] ) and taub ( [ ectaub ] ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , different functional forms of the limit of @xmath189 do not lead to different limits , since coordinate transformations can take one form to the others .",
    "this analysis covers all petrov type d and 0 limits .",
    "geroch @xcite introduced the concept of a closed family of metrics , i.e. , a family that contains all its limits . considering the family of metrics defined by ( [ ds2 ] )",
    ", we can say that it is closed under petrov type d and 0 limits as @xmath179 tends to @xmath71 or @xmath130 .    as a matter of completeness ,",
    "we mention that the limits of the generalized schwarzschild family as @xmath230 and @xmath231 or @xmath225 are exactly the same as the limits as @xmath232 .",
    "this can be easily seen from the cartan scalars ( [ ec ] ) , noting specially the expression of @xmath190 .",
