    "late  type t dwarfs ( t @xmath15 600 k ) are among the dimmest , coldest and least massive products of star formation . as cooling brown dwarfs ( bds ) , these objects sample a broad range of age and mass , from old , relatively massive relics of the earliest epochs of galactic star formation to recently  formed planetary ",

    "despite its astronomical utility , high  resolution spectroscopy of late t dwarfs is exceedingly rare .",

    "the fire spectrograph @xcite was installed and commissioned on the baade magellan telescope at las campanas observatory during march and april 2010 .",
    "fire is a single - object spectrograph with two modes : a cross  dispersed echellette mode with moderate resolution ( @xmath24 ) , and a longslit low resolution mode ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the spectrum is imaged on a hawaii-2rg chip , with continuous coverage from 0.85 - 2.5 @xmath18 m . in the cross  dispersed mode ,",
    "the spectrum is spread over 21 orders , with some overlap in wavelength coverage at the edges of each order .",
    "target acquisition is achieved with a second nir imager and mauna kea observatory @xmath26 filter focused on the entrance slit .",
    "fire was designed to be sensitive , employing the latest generation of hgcdte detectors while limiting the number of reflective and transmissive surfaces , resulting in a zero - point of @xmath27 mag ( for 1  count  pixel@xmath14  s@xmath14 across @xmath28 ) for the echelle mode .",
    "on april 6 , 2010 ut , we obtained four 900s exposures of ugps  0722@xmath205 in fire s echelle mode .",
    "the sky was clear with no cloud cover , and seeing was @xmath29 in @xmath26 at the time of observation .",
    "the 0@xmath30 slit was used and aligned with the parallactic angle and the airmass was @xmath31 .",
    "the exposures were dithered along the slit in a abba pattern and a fowler sampling of 8 was employed .",
    "an a0v star , hip 63714 , was observed for telluric correction and flux calibration purposes .",

    "a combination of oh telluric lines and thar arc images were used to determine the wavelength solution along the center of each order and its tilt in the spatial direction , which was used to construct a two dimensional vacuum wavelength map .",
    "the typical uncertainty of the wavelength solution was 0.15 pixels , corresponding to 0.04 - 0.4 angstroms depending on the order .",
    "a 2d sky model was constructed using basis splines @xcite and subtracted from each order .",
    "this step eliminates the need for abba - type dithers for sky subtraction .",
    "an optimal extraction routine was then performed on each order @xcite , extracting the object flux onto a heliocentric rest frame wavelength grid .",
    "telluric corrections were incorporated into the pipeline using a modified version of _ xtellcor _ from spextool @xcite .",
    "telluric absorption was quantified by comparing the telluric stellar spectrum to a model vega spectrum reddened using the @xmath32 color of hip 63714 , velocity shifted , and broadened using the 1.005  @xmath33 h  i pa  @xmath34 line as a line kernel .",
