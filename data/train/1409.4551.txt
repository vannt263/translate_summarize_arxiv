    "our networks of coupled circuits are composed of units which are known as a common motif in neural and genetic networks in different realizations .",
    "the basic motif is found whenever bistable units are coupled to negative feedback loops .",
    "the motif consists of a first species @xmath0 that activates itself in a positive feedback loop , while it also activates a second species @xmath1 in a negative feedback loop that acts as its own repressor .",
    "examples are signaling systems like the slime mold dictyosthelium discoideum @xcite , the embryonic division control system @xcite , or the mapk - cascade @xcite , and the circadian clock @xcite .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite , this motif shows three regimes , characterized by different attractors , when a single bifurcation parameter is monotonically increased : excitable behavior , where the system approaches a fixed point ( if the perturbation from the fixed point exceeds a certain threshold , the system makes a long excursion in phase space before it returns to the fixed point ) , limit - cycle behavior , and again excitable behavior .",
    "the individual dynamics resembles fitzhugh - nagumo units @xcite .",
    "so it is more complex than bistable systems , phase oscillators or repressilators , and when these units are coupled , it should not come as a surprise that the resulting dynamics can be rather versatile .    here",
    "we consider two cases : a coupled set of minimal size , these are two units with mutually repressive coupling , and a large set of the order of a few thousands of these units , coupled with repression on two - dimensional grids .",
    "the first case will illustrate the proliferation of attractors induced by the coupling , and the kind of bifurcations which influence the complex structure of the attractor landscape ; the latter one reveals collective coherent behavior that resembles an individual unit and allows for possible applications in genetic or cellular networks .",
    "the system of two units may function as a synthetic device like a toggle switch , for which the system here can toggle between eight different regimes in a two - dimensional parameter space .",
    "the parameter space is spanned by the bifurcation parameter @xmath2 , which is related to the production rate of the first species @xmath0 , and the coupling strength @xmath3 .",
    "the different regimes are characterized by their attractors .",
    "the attractors can be fixed - point solutions or synchronized oscillations with different patterns of phase - locked motion .",
    "a single regime may have multistable stationary states .",
    "in such a situation it is of interest how we can control the return to a given initial state after we perform a closed path in parameter space .    for the larger system",
    "we choose a two - dimensional grid of @xmath4 oscillators . as for an individual unit , also",
    "the collective behavior of the whole ensemble can be easily tuned via a single ( namely the same ) bifurcation parameter to vary from collective fixed - point to synchronized limit - cycle to collective fixed - point behavior .",
    "this option exists for a wide range of parameters for different lattice topologies , boundary conditions and initial conditions .",
    "the very patterns of phase - locked motion in the oscillatory regime and the combination of fixed points in the other regimes depend , however , on the geometry , the choice of free or periodic boundary conditions , and the random or structured initial conditions .",
    "in particular we indicate applications to patterns in the so - called segmentation clock . in relation to the segmentation clock",
    "it is an open question which mechanism is responsible in particular for the arrest of genetic oscillations .",
    "our coupled circuits initiate and arrest the oscillations via two bifurcations of the same dynamics , once a single parameter is monotonically changed .",
    "therefore we speculate that the same kind of mechanism may be realized in the segmentation clock , without any need for finetuning some parameters or relying on external interference .    as a remarkable transient phenomenon",
    "we describe the emergence of target waves that are seemingly emitted from a single site on the grid , so that the symmetry between the uniformly equipped oscillators is dynamically broken .",
    "these waves look like a self - organized pacemaker and fade away after several thousand time units , a period that may be sufficiently long to have an impact on biological systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we present the model .",
    "[ sec3 ] is devoted to a detailed bifurcation analysis of the toggle switch and a partial extrapolation of bifurcations to larger system sizes , including some results about the functioning as a toggle switch . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we summarize the results of numerical simulations for the larger system size and point to possible biological applications .",
    "a summary and outlook is given in sec .",

    "the interaction between the two units is realized by repression between two individuals of species @xmath0 . ]    in this model , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are two different species .",
    "although from a statistical physics point of view the identity of @xmath0 , @xmath1 is not important , we shall assume here that @xmath0 , @xmath1 are two different protein types .",
    "this is in line with the original motivation of this model as a coarse - grained description of some genetic circuits . the protein @xmath0 activates its own production ( transcription in the biological language ) and also the production of the protein @xmath1 , which in turn represses the production of @xmath0 . in this way",
    ", we have a self - activating bistable unit which is coupled to a negative feedback loop . the simplest , idealized implementation of this unit has been analyzed on a deterministic level , with protein concentrations as the only dynamical variables , and it is known to produce oscillations in a certain range of model parameters @xcite . in particular , the model studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , which we adopt here , assumes that the protein production rates depend on the concentrations @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the two protein species as follows : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ratio of the half - life of @xmath0 to that of @xmath1 .",
    "here we shall focus on the case @xmath9 , that is when the protein @xmath1 has a much longer half - life than @xmath0 with a slow reaction on changes in @xmath0 , while @xmath0 has a fast response to changes in @xmath1 .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 sets the strength of repression of @xmath0 by @xmath1 .",
    "we shall assume @xmath11 , so that already a small concentration of @xmath1 will inhibit the production of @xmath0 .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 determines the basal expression level of @xmath0 .",
    "we set this parameter to anything larger than zero but much smaller than one , so that the system can not be absorbed in the state @xmath13 and , simultaneously , the production rate of @xmath0 is small for @xmath14 .",
    "the hill coefficients ( powers of @xmath5 , @xmath6 on the r.h.s . of eqs .",
    "( [ eq - det11])-([eq - det12 ] ) ) are chosen as in @xcite .",
    "we keep them fixed throughout the paper .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 is the maximal rate of production of @xmath0 for full activation ( @xmath15 ) and no repression ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "this will be one of our tunable parameters which we will use to control the behavior of our model , also when these units are coupled .",
    "this parameter seems to be also the easiest one to control in real , experimental systems @xcite .",
    "the different fixed - point and oscillatory regimes of such an individual unit are separated by subcritical hopf bifurcations ( for a definition see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) with corresponding hysteresis effects @xcite .    from now on ,",
    "we do no longer distinguish between the species and their concentrations in the notation and write @xmath17 for the corresponding concentrations .",
    "we consider coupled units with only repressing couplings ( for simplicity , since the effect of activating couplings can be compensated by an appropriate choice of geometry , see @xcite ) according to @xmath18 here @xmath19 labels the units .",
    "the parameters @xmath2 , @xmath10 , @xmath12 and @xmath8 are chosen uniformly over the grid , and @xmath10 , @xmath12 and @xmath8 with the same values as introduced for a single unit , that is @xmath20 , @xmath21 , so without any finetuning , and kept fixed throughout the paper like the hill coefficients .",
    "we should remark that the bifurcation diagram and the synchronization properties may alter if one of these parameters would change . for a system of two coupled repressilators it was shown @xcite that the very hill coefficients and reaction time scales ( in our case also implicitly kept fixed ) can dramatically influence the type of synchronization , so that it is not the mere network topology of activating or repressing couplings that determines the synchronization .",
    "therefore our conclusions should be understood to hold for given fixed values of these parameters .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 is also chosen independently of the lattice site , but as a bifurcation parameter it is varied between @xmath22 and @xmath23 or @xmath24 , depending on the repressive coupling strength , parameterized by @xmath3 , being weak ( @xmath25 ) or strong ( @xmath26 ) , respectively .",
    "in general @xmath3 is chosen with the same value on all bonds and in opposite directions , although we shall briefly discuss the effect of choosing it asymmetrically in the toggle switch in section [ secbifurcation ] . finally , the adjacency matrix elements @xmath27 take values 1 if there is a directed coupling from @xmath19 to @xmath28 and zero otherwise .",
    "the adjacency matrix will be chosen to represent different lattice topologies as explained later in the corresponding sections .",
    "in the following we encounter fold bifurcations , sub- or supercritical pitchfork bifurcations and sub- or supercritical hopf bifurcations . in our four - dimensional system",
    "a hopf bifurcation may amount to the lost of stability in all rather than in only two directions .",
    "this can lead to the birth of saddle - limit cycles rather than stable or unstable limit cycles .",

    "the reason is that it is the single parameter @xmath2 , whose monotonic increase allows to turn on the collective oscillations in a first bifurcation and to arrest these oscillations later in a second bifurcation .",
    "its tuning therefore provides a mechanism for controlling the duration of collective oscillations in a simple way , without external interference and without finetuning of parameters . because of its simplicity , such a mechanism may be realized in biological applications . in particular it may be relevant for the segmentation clock .",

    "a delayed coupling theory was developed as a phenomenological mesoscopic description of the vertebrate segmentation in terms of phase oscillators to represent cyclic gene expression in the cells of the psm .",
    "the oscillators are coupled to their neighbors with delay and have a moving boundary , describing the elongation of the embryo axis .",
    "they are equipped with a profile of natural frequencies that is particularly designed to slow down the oscillations and stop them at the arrest front .",

    "so far , negative feedback loops were identified in the zebrafish , where certain dimers repress the genes of their components @xcite , but no indications for self - activating loops have been found so far .",
    "this does , of course , not exclude their existence . on the modeling side , for comparison we simulated both , a system of coupled repressilators , and our system of coupled circuits in the limit of very strong coupling . in this case",
    "the control of the duration of oscillations failed in the sense that the first and third fixed - point regime either were absent or the oscillatory regime is replaced by a chaotic one .",
    "so our mechanism does not seem to work with simpler building blocks , blocks without positive self - activation .    from a more general perspective",
    "the role of positive feedback loops in combination with negative ones was studied in @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that in general a combination of interlinked positive and negative feedback loops of interacting genes allows to adjust the frequency of a negative feedback oscillator while keeping the amplitude of oscillations nearly constant . at the same time",
    ", the combination with a positive feedback loop makes the system more robust against perturbations , and therefore improves its reliability .",
    "although it seems to be open whether these observations are relevant for the segmentation clock , these results together with our observations may trigger a search for self - activating loops on the experimental side of the segmentation clock .      among the variety of transient patterns such as spirals , rectangular or plane waves , it is of particular interest that we see also target waves , emitted from units that act like dynamically generated pacemakers , this means in a self - organized way . in an ensemble of oscillators ,",

    "+ from the jacobian of a system of @xmath202 units , evaluated at the homogeneous fixed point , one can read off that the number of hopf bifurcations increases sub - linearly in @xmath202 . for @xmath202 units we can have up to @xmath202-fold hopf bifurcations with n pairs of complex conjugate eigenvalues whose real part changes sign at the same time ( as we saw for the two and four units ) .",
