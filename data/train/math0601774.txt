    "first , let us briefly recall what functional quantization is and how it was introduced .",

    "the _ voronoi quantization _ of an @xmath19-valued random vector @xmath20 _ with respect to the codebook @xmath21 _ is simply the projection of @xmath22 onto @xmath21 following the nearest neighbor rule , that is @xmath23 where @xmath24 @xmath25 being a borel partition of @xmath19 satisfying , for every @xmath26 , @xmath27 then , the @xmath28-mean quantization error ( @xmath29 ) is defined by @xmath30 this quantity is finite provided @xmath31 . the set @xmath21 is called an @xmath32-_codebook _ or @xmath32-_quantizer_. it can be shown that such random vectors @xmath33 are the best approximation of @xmath22 among all @xmath21-valued random vectors . the minimal @xmath32th quantization error of @xmath22",

    "the @xmath28-integrability assumption then reads @xmath38    it is still an open question whether @xmath28-optimal @xmath32-quantizers for gaussian random vectors always exist in an abstract banach space setting ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "however , in many situations of interest for processes , including all the@xmath1,dt)$]-spaces , @xmath39 , the existence of at least one such @xmath28-optimal codebook has been established ( provided @xmath40 ) .",
    "note , however , that this is not the case for the space @xmath41)$ ] of continuous functions . for more details on the existence problem for optimal quantizers",
    ", we refer to  @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", optimal @xmath28-quantizers always exist when @xmath42 , @xmath43 . in this finite - dimensional setting ,",
    "this problem is known as _ optimal vector quantization _ and has been extensively investigated since the early 1950s with some applications to signal processing and transmission ( see  @xcite or  @xcite ) .    in @xmath44-dimensions ,",
    "the convergence rate of @xmath45 is given by the so - called zador theorem , @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the density of the absolutely continuous part of the distribution @xmath48 of @xmath22 and @xmath49 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "since the early 2000 s , much attention has been paid to the infinite - dimensional case .",

    "many results have been obtained for several families of processes with special attention having been paid to gaussian processes and ( brownian ) diffusion processes by several authors .",
    "thus , in the purely hilbert space setting ( @xmath51 , @xmath52,dt)$ ] ) , the sharp rate of quantization of the brownian motion @xmath53}$ ] is given ( see  ( 3.6 ) in  @xcite ) by @xmath54,dt ) ) \\sim \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\,t}{\\pi(\\log n)^ { 1/2}}.\\ ] ] the existence of such a _ sharp rate _ for brownian motion has been extended to @xmath1,dt)$ ] spaces for @xmath55 ( see  @xcite ) . similar sharp rates ( with an explicit constant ) hold for a wide class of gaussian processes , including the fractional brownian motions for which we have @xmath56,dt ) ) \\sim \\frac{c(h , t)}{(\\log n)^{h}},\\ ] ] where @xmath57 denotes the hurst parameter of the fractional brownian motion @xmath58 , the ornstein  uhlenbeck process , the brownian sheet , and so on , in the purely hilbert space setting ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the exact rate has also been established in  @xcite ( section  3 ) for a wider class of gaussian processes . in  @xcite , these results are based on the ( sharp or exact ) asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues of high order of the karhunen ",
    "love expansion of the gaussian process . as a byproduct",
    ", this approach provides very simple explicit sequences of rate - optimal asymptotic quantizers ( provided that the karhunen ",
    "love expansion of the process itself is accessible ) .",
    "their numerical implementation has lead to some unexpectedly promising numerical applications in finance , especially for the pricing of path - dependent options like asian options in several popular models of asset dynamics ( black  scholes , stochastic volatility heston and sabr models , etc . ) .",
    "for these aspects , we refer to  @xcite or  @xcite .",
    "we also mention applications of quantization to statistical clustering of data ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) and some more recent developments concerning functional data investigated in  @xcite and  @xcite .    for gaussian processes ,",
    "an important connection with the small ball probability problem has been made ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "some exact or sharp rates of convergence for different classes of brownian diffusions have also recently been proven ( see  @xcite ) with a rate driven by @xmath59 .    the common feature shared by all these results",
    "is that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the exponent @xmath60 that controls the @xmath61-quantization rate of these processes in the @xmath62 scale and their mean pathwise regularity , that is , the largest exponent @xmath60 that satisfies @xmath63\\qquad \\|x_t - x_s\\|_{l^r(\\mathbb{p})}\\leq c_r|t - s|^a.\\ ] ]    although such a correspondence is not really surprising given the connection between quantization rate and small ball probabilities in the gaussian setting , this naturally leads to an attempt to derive a general abstract result that connects these two features of a process .",
    "this is the aim of section  [ upper - bound ] of this paper , in which we show that the mean pathwise regularity always provides a universal upper bound for the @xmath64-quantization rate ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "we then retrieve the rate obtained by more specific approaches for all the processes mentioned above .",
    "we also extend to general brownian diffusion processes and even general it processes the rate formerly obtained for specific classes of diffusions in  @xcite .",
    "we also obtain some first quantization rates for some classes of lvy processes .",
    "the main technique is to expand a process on the simplest wavelet basis  the haar basis ( known to be unconditional when @xmath66)and to use a nonasymptotic version of the zador theorem ( a slight improvement of the pierce lemma ; see  @xcite ) .    at this point , the next question is to ask conversely whether this always provides the true quantization rate . in this nave form ,",
    "the answer to this question is clearly `` no '' because equation  ( [ meanpathcont ] ) only takes into account the mean pathwise h \" older regularity of a process and one can trivially build ( see  @xcite ) some processes with smoother mean regularity ( like processes with @xmath67 , @xmath68 , trajectories ) .",
    "we do not extend our approach in that direction , for the sake of simplicity , but there is no doubt that developing techniques similar to those used in section  [ upper - bound ] , one can connect higher order mean pathwise regularity and quantization rate , as in the hlder setting .",
    "this would require an appropriate wavelet basis .",
    "in fact , we point out in section  [ levylevy ] , devoted to general lvy processes , that the answer may be negative  the quantization rate can be infinitely faster than the mean pathwise regularity  for different reasons in connection with the dimensionality of the process : a poisson process is , in some sense , an almost finite - dimensional random vector which induces a very fast quantization rate which does not take place in the @xmath69 scale , although the mean pathwise @xmath4-regularity of a poisson process is hlder [ and depends on @xmath70 ; see , e.g. ,  ( [ poissrle1 ] ) and  ( [ poissrge1 ] ) ] .",
    "conversely , we emphasize , via on several classes of examples , that the upper bound derived from mean regularity provides the true rate of quantization .",
    "this follows from a comparison with the lower bound that can be derived from small deviation results ( see ,  e.g. ,  @xcite or the remark below theorem  [ upper1 ] which elucidates the connection between functional quantization and small deviation theory ) .",
    "thus , we prove that our approach yields the exact rate for a wide class of subordinated lvy processes ( including symmetric @xmath21-stable processes ) .    the main result of section  [ levylevy ] is theorem  [ levyrate ] , which provides a functional quantization rate for a general lvy process @xmath22 having no brownian component : this rate is controlled by the behavior of the lvy measure @xmath71 around @xmath72 ( e.g. , the index of @xmath22 for a stable process ) . as an example for lvy processes which have infinitely many small jumps , if the ( infinite ) lvy measure @xmath71 ( is locally absolutely continuous around 0 and ) satisfies @xmath73}\\nu(dx)\\leq\\frac { c } { |x|^{\\underline \\theta + 1}}\\mathbf{1}_{\\{0<|x| \\leq c]}\\,dx\\ ] ] for some @xmath74 $ ] , then , for every @xmath75 $ ] such that @xmath76 and @xmath77 , @xmath78,dt ) )   = o((\\log n)^{-{1}/{\\underline \\theta}}).\\ ] ] this makes a connection between quantization rate and the blumenthal ",
    "getoor index @xmath79 of @xmath22 when @xmath71 satisfies the above upper bound with @xmath80 .",
    "in fact , a more general result is established in theorem  [ levyrate ] : when the `` @xmath72-tail function '' @xmath81^c)$ ] has regular variation as @xmath82 goes to @xmath72 , with index @xmath83 , then @xmath84 ( see  @xcite ) and we establish a close connection between the quantization rate of @xmath22 and @xmath85 , @xmath86 . in many cases of interest , including @xmath21-stable processes and other classes of subordinated lvy processes ,",
    "we show that this general upper bound provides the exact rate of quantization ; it matches the lower bound estimates derived from the connection between quantization rate and small deviation estimates ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "when the lvy process does have a brownian component , its exact quantization rate is @xmath87 , like brownian motion [ when @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "when the lvy measure is finite ( then @xmath90 ) , we also establish some quantization rates for the compound poisson processes and show they are infinitely faster than the above ones . to this end , we design an explicit sequence of quantizers which can clearly be implemented for numerical purposes .",
    "in fact , the whole proof is constructive , provided the lvy measure is `` tractable '' enough .",

    "<S> our main tool is the haar basis . </S>",
    "<S> we then emphasize that the derived functional quantization rate may be optimal ( e.g. , for brownian motion or symmetric stable processes ) so that the rate is optimal as a universal upper bound . as a first application </S>",
    "<S> , we establish the @xmath3 upper bound for general it processes which include multidimensional diffusions . </S>",
    "<S> then , we focus on the specific family of lvy processes for which we derive a general quantization rate based on the regular variation properties of its lvy measure at  0 . </S>",
    "<S> the case of compound poisson processes , which appear as degenerate in the former approach , is studied specifically : we observe some rates which are between the finite - dimensional and infinite - dimensional `` usual '' rates .    and    .    . </S>"
