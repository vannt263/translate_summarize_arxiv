    "general relativity is based on the premises that the spacetime is curved affected by matter according to the einstein equation , and that the objects move along the spacetime geodesics .",
    "the gravitations are apparent phenomena of the inertial motions in the curved spacetime .",
    "this successfully explains why the motion in the  gravitational \" field is universal , i.e. blind to the object properties ( mass , charge etc . ) , and why the  gravitational \" forces are subject to the newton s law of gravitation ( within the ordinary precision ) .",
    "it is supported by further precise observations .",
    "it raises , however , another fundamental question why the spacetime is curved so as the einstein equation indicates .",
    "a possible answer was as follows : suppose our spacetime is a 3 + 1 dimensional embedded object like domain walls or vortices ( braneworld , @xcite@xcite ) in higher dimensional spacetime , and the gravity is induced through quantum fluctuations ( brane induced gravity , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the cosmological constant should be finely tuned .",
    "then , the brane - gravity field emerges as a composite , which obeys an einstein - like equation at least at low curvatures , just like in the case of the ( non - brane ) induced gravity theory @xcite@xcite .",
    "the ideas of the braneworld and the brane induced gravity have been studied extensively in the last three decades .",
    "physical models were constructed with topological defects in higher dimensional spacetime @xcite@xcite , and they were realized as ",

    "they were applied to the hierarchy problem with large extra dimensions , or with warped extra dimensions @xcite , @xcite@xcite .",
    "it was argued that the brane induced gravity would imply infrared modifications of the gravity theory @xcite@xcite .",
    "the ideas have been studied in wide areas including basic formalism , @xcite@xcite , brane induced gravity @xcite@xcite , particle physics phenenomenology @xcite@xcite , and cosmology @xcite@xcite with many interesting consequences .    in this paper , we establish a precise formalism to derive the expressions for the quantum induced effects on the brane . for definiteness",
    ", we follow the simplest model with the dirac - nambu - goto type dynamics @xcite .",
    "such a model was first considered in @xcite with scalar fields which we now interpret as the position coordinate of the brane in higher dimensions .",
    "such an interpretation motivated us to consider the model of braneworld as a topological object moving in higher dimensions in @xcite .",
    "the idea of the brane induced gravity has been considered repeatedly in the literature .",
    "they were , however , more or less naive both in model setting and derivation . here",
    "we present a comprehensive formalism from its foundation to the precise outcomes . among the quantum fluctuations , the only meaningful ones are those transverse to the brane .",
    "the quantum loop effects are divergent , which should be cutoff at the scale of the inverse thickness of the brane .",
    "we adopt the regularization scheme used in the original work @xcite , and calculate them at the one - loop level .",
    "we determine the coefficients of the induced cosmological and gravity terms , as well as those of the terms including the extrinsic curvature and the normal connection gauge field @xcite .",
    "the induction of the latter terms is characteristic of the brane induced gravity theory , distinguished from the ordinary ( non - brane ) induced gravity .",
    "it turns out that the induced - metric formula is converted into an einstein - like equation via the quantum short - distance effects .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , we define the model ( sec .  [ model ] ) , and then we derive the quantum effects ( secs .  [ fluctuations][calculation ] ) .",
    "we define the brane fluctuations ( sec .",
    "[ fluctuations ] ) , formulate the quantum effects ( sec .  [ quantum ] ) , specify the method to regularize the divergences ( sec .  [ cutoff ] ) , classify the possible induced terms according to symmetries ( sec .  [ classification ] ) , and calculate them via feynman diagram method ( sec .  [ calculation ] ) .",
    "then , we interpret the quantum induced terms , and show why the induced gravity can avoid the problem ( secs .  [ cosmological ] and",
    "[ induced gravity ] ) .",
    "the cosmological terms are fine - tuned ( sec .",
    "[ cosmological ] ) , and the einstein like gravity and other terms are induced ( sec .",
    "[ induced gravity ] ) .",
    "the final section ( sec .",
    "[ discussions ] ) is devoted to discussions .",
    "we consider a quantum theoretical braneworld described by the dirac - nambu - goto type lagrangian .",
    "we will see the quantum effects of the brane fluctuations give rise to effective braneworld gravity .",

    "we assume that @xmath15 appears nowhere other than in @xmath17 in the total lagrangian @xmath18 including the bulk lagrangian .",
    "the system is invariant under the general coordinate transformation of the bulk and the brane separately .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ ng ] ) is the simplest among those with this symmetry .",
    "note that we do not a priori have the kinetic term of the metric in the basic lagrangian ( [ ng ] )",
    ". it will be induced through quantum effects .",
    "the metric emerges as a composite field , and the gravitation is an induced phenomenon but not an elementary one .",
    "if this is successful , we achieve a great conceptual advantage , since it means that the familiar and important phenomenon of the gravitation is explained by the more fundamental ingredients .",
    "thus , it is worthwhile and urgent to examine what is true and what is not in this idea .",
    "this is the basic spirit of the induced gravity theory @xcite@xcite . as for the dynamics of the bulk metric",
    ", the situation is more vague and ambiguous .",
    "we do not know what is the dynamics , i.e. what kinetic term we have , and it is not clear even whether the kinetic term exists or not , i.e. whether it is dynamical or not .",
    "every case well deserves intensive investigations .",
    "it is too naive to take that the bulk einstein equation provides the brane einstein equation at the brane , because large discrepancies take place due to the extrinsic curvature terms",
    ". the brane moves according to its equation of motion and is deformed in manners different from what the naive gravity equation indicates .",
    "one may elaborate the elementary brane gravity from the elementary bulk gravity under specific conditions by hand in specific models @xcite",
    ", @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", many people relied on the mechanism of brane induced gravity to realize gravitation on the brane @xcite , @xcite , @xcite@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in the spirit of the brane induced gravity",
    ", we do not a priori assume elementary gravity , and we take it to be induced from more fundamental ingredients .",

    "we expect that this gives a good approximation at low curvature limit in many dynamical models of the braneworld ( e.g. topological defects , spacetime singularities , d - branes , etc . ) .",
    "it is remarkable that , as we shall see below , this simple model exhibits brane gravity and gauge theory like structure through the quantum effects .    for convenience of quantum treatments ,",
    "we consider the following equivalent lagrangian to ( [ ng ] ) : @xmath23    \\label{ng'}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is an auxiliary field , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the inverse matrix of @xmath24 .",

    "now @xmath24 in ( [ ngem ] ) is independent of @xmath15 , and , instead , we have an extra equation ( [ gmunu ] ) , which guarantees that @xmath24 is the induced metric .",
    "if we substitute ( [ gmunu ] ) into ( [ ngem ] ) , we obtain the same equation as ( [ ngem ] ) .",
    "thus the systems with the lagrangians @xmath17 and @xmath30 coincide .",

    "_ among the fluctuations , only those transverse to the brane are physically meaningful _ , because those along the brane remain within the brane and cause no real fluctuations of the brane .",

    "the arbitrariness of @xmath40 in choice under the condition ( [ ny ] ) gives rise to gauge symmetry under the group gl(@xmath33 ) of the general linear transformations of the normal space at each point on the brane .",

    "a problem of the definition ( [ fluctuation ] ) of @xmath50 is that @xmath50 lacks the bulk general - coordinate invariance .",
    "in fact , it is transformed in a complex way under the general coordinate transformations of the bulk . on the contrary",

    "the divergences can not be renormalized because the original action does not have these terms .",
    "they give rise to genuine quantum induced effects .",
    "thus , we have derived the quantum effects of the brane fluctuations . among them",

    "\\   y^m=0    \\label{confemb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] instead of the condition ( [ cosmcan ] ) .",
    "this is also an extremely unnatural fine tuning .",
    "thus , the present model is not satisfactory in natural understanding of the cosmological constant .",
    "it is , however , not a problem for the model alone , but a serious puzzle for general quantum theoretical models with gravity .",
    "it is an open problem , and we wish that it will be solved in the future . the problem will be partly addressed in our forthcoming paper . here ,",
    "we phenomenologically adjust the tiny cosmological term via fine tuning of ( [ cosmcan ] ) or ( [ confemb ] ) .",
    "if the cosmological term is suppressed , the main contribution in the quantum effects ( [ sdiv ] ) comes from the @xmath189 term .",
    "it is nothing but the einstein - hilbert action , which supply the kinetic term for the auxiliary field @xmath24 .",
    "the sign of the term is right one to give ordinary attractive gravity in accordance with the observation , and its magnitude indicates that the cutoff @xmath167 is order of the planck scale .",
    "the term with @xmath190 gives small corrections of @xmath191 as far as the brane curvature is small .",
    "the terms with @xmath149 , @xmath150and @xmath152 are the mass and interaction terms of the field @xmath56 .",
    "note that no kinetic term for @xmath56 appears .",
    "this is because the @xmath56 interacts with @xmath50 only in the combination @xmath192 , but not in single .",
    "the term with @xmath193 squared gives the kinetic and the interaction terms of the field @xmath55 as the gauge field .",
    "the fields @xmath55 and @xmath56 appear as fields on the brane .",
    "we should , however , be careful because they are not independent and are defined by ( [ amnmu ] ) and ( [ bmmunu ] ) in terms of @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "the quantum induced terms in ( [ sdiv ] ) modify the equations of motion . the equation ( [ ngem ] ) for @xmath194 is modified through the @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath152 and @xmath196 terms in ( [ sdiv ] ) .",
    "the classical solution @xmath194 is deformed according to it . the correction terms are suppressed by at least a factor of @xmath197 for small curvatures .",
    "the equation ( [ gmunu ] ) for @xmath24 , the induced - metric formula , is converted into the einstein equation with the @xmath198 correction terms and the energy momentum tensor for the fields @xmath50 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath194 .",
    "the equation ( [ gmunu ] ) holds as operator relation . in classical realizations",
    ", however , it suffers from a large quantum corrections .",
    "then , we no longer have the induced - metric formula .",
    "the metric @xmath24 emerges in the channel of intermediate quantum states composed of @xmath50 s , despite its absence in the original setup of the system ( [ ng ] ) .",
    "hence , it is interpreted as a composite of the brane fluctuation fields @xmath50 .",
    "then the natural question is what is the further quantum effects of the composite metric . within the semi - classical treatments",
    ", it suffices to calculate only the one loop diagrams .",
    "the system does not include multi - loop diagrams .",
    "this is the virtue of the linear definition ( [ fluctuation ] ) of the brane fluctuation . beyond the semi - classical approximation ,",
    "however , we should take into account the higher order diagrams with the internal lines of composite metric fields .",
    "the quantum induction mechanism of composite fields is common phenomena to various composite field theories @xcite .",
    "a class of non - renormalizable theories with this mechanism becomes equivalent to some remormalizable models ( with finite momentum cutoff ) under the  compositeness condition \" that the wave - function renormalization constant vanishes @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this renders us clues to formulate unambiguously the non - renormalizable theories at higher orders @xcite .",
    "for example , the nambu - jona - lasinio model is equivalent to the yukawa model with the vanishing renormalization constants of the scalar and the pseudoscalar fields , and the latter renders a unambiguous higher - order descriptions of the former .    in the present case , however , the induced composite field theory is the modified einstein gravity , and is not renormalizable .",
    "we have no definite way to calculate the quantum effects due to the metric itself at higher orders .",
    "it shares the problems with the general quantum gravity theories .",
    "so we can not apply all the achievements of the composite field theories with the compositeness condition .",
    "they are , however , very suggestive in considering properties of the quantum fluctuations . in composite theories , it is plausible that the quantum effects due to the composite would require different treatments .",
    "for example , if the cutoff for the composites is much smaller than that for the constituents , the effects can be suppressed @xcite . or",
    ", the 1/@xmath199 expansion would be useful , as is in the various composite field theories @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . we need further ideas and investigations for the more complete treatments .",
    "we can see in ( [ sdiv ] ) that the quantum effects give rise to the terms including the extrinsic curvature @xmath56 and the normal connection @xmath55 , in addition to the induced - gravity terms @xcite .",
    "the induction of these terms is characteristic of the brane induced gravity theory , distinguished from the ordinary ( non - brane ) induced gravity .",
    "the fact was recognized in @xcite and @xcite in the general braneworld scheme , and they were actually calculated in @xcite , @xcite for the domain - wall type braneworld .",
    "the forms of induced terms depend on the brane dynamics .",
    "the simplest case of the nambu - goto action was considered in @xcite within the four dimensional field theory . in the model , however , only the gravity is induced , but no other terms .",
    "this is because the spacetime spanned by the scalar fields is not the real one , and hence it assumes no symmetry of the whole spacetime involving the brane .",
    "therefore , we can not define the normal to the brane . on the contrary",
    ", the present model ( [ ng ] ) possesses general - coordinate invariance of the bulk , as well as that of the brane .",
    "therefore , the fluctuations along the brane is meaningless , and the only physical ones are those transverse to the brane , as are defined by ( [ ny])([yy+nn = g ] ) .",
    "this is the origin how it includes the @xmath200 and @xmath56 dependent terms .",
    "they should be determined according to the brane dynamics , as is done here .",
    "it would be an interesting and urgent subject to derive the induced terms in various brane dynamics , and seek for the models suited for applications",

    "<S> we present a comprehensive formalism to derive precise expressions for the induced gravity of the braneworld , assuming the dynamics of the dirac - nambu - goto type . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum fluctuations of the brane at short distances give rise to divergences , which should be cutoff at the scale of the inverse thickness of the brane . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the induced - metric formula is converted into an einstein - like equation via the quantum effects . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the coefficients of the induced cosmological and gravity terms , as well as those of the terms including the extrinsic curvature and the normal connection gauge field . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is the characteristic of the brane induced gravity theory , distinguished from ordinary none - brane induced gravity . </S>"
