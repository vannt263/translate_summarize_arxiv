    "the quark model presently plays a role in the classification of hadronic particles similar to the role played by the periodic table of chemical elements in the nineteenth century . from a microscopic viewpoint , the interaction holding the quarks together",
    "is often taken to be described by the yang - mills glue of quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "however , the qcd derivation of the quark confinement within the hadron is more than just a little obscure . in order to make contact with experiments , some effective model of confinement",
    "must be constructed .",
    "the models include bags or string fragmentation constructions .",
    "the word `` glue '' , within a given model , here denotes whatever the physical substance ( perhaps yang - mills gauge gluons ) that binds the quarks together .    of the qcd inspired quark binding pictures , perhaps the most popular among experimentalists is the string fragmentation model @xcite @xcite .",
    "this model can be partly understood as a consequence of the wilson closed loop conjecture@xcite . briefly ,",
    "wilson considered the action of sending a quark with qcd charge @xmath0 around a closed space - time path @xmath1 which bounds a space - time area @xmath2 ; i.e the vacuum wilson action @xmath3 is defined by @xmath4 where the subscript @xmath5 denotes path ordering .",
    "the wilson conjecture is that the action is proportional to the area for sufficiently large loops ; i.e. @xmath6 in order to see the physical significance of the proportionality constant @xmath7 , consider a rectangular space - time wilson loop as shown in fig .  1",
    ". the particle moves forward in time @xmath8 as a quark , space - like displacement @xmath9 as a string , backward in time @xmath10 as an anti - quark , and space - like displacement @xmath11 as a string .",
    "the area of the loop is @xmath12 where the negative sign comes from the factor @xmath13 in the lorentz metric for time - like intervals .",
    "the wilson loop action for this case is then given by @xmath14    for an observer of the loop , the physical situation is as follows : there exists a quark and an anti - quark at fixed points in space connected by a string of length @xmath9 .",
    "the string energy @xmath15 for this situation is contained in the action @xmath3 via the quantum mechanical rule for the time translation amplitude , @xmath16 the energy of the string of length @xmath9 is thereby @xmath17 the parameter @xmath18 in the wilson loop eq.(2 ) is merely the string tension .",
    "if the wilson conjecture holds true , then a meson which consists of a quark ( at position @xmath19 ) and an anti - quark ( at position @xmath20 ) exhibits confinement from a `` string potential energy '' @xmath21 more generally , if the action of wilson loops scales as the area , then a potential energy for @xmath22 constituent quarks obeys the scaling law @xmath23 where @xmath24    the purpose of this work is to examine the consequences of homogeneous scaling potentials for the partitioning of the hadron rest energy @xmath25 into quark energy and glue energy .",
    "if the hadron is made up of light quarks , then it turns out that wilson scaling implies that the rest energy of the hadron is in equal parts quark energy and glue energy .",
    "this equipartitioning of hadron rest energy is in experimental agreement with strong interaction data , as will be discussed in sec .",
    "if the hadron contains heavy quarks , then wilson scaling predicts deviations from the equipartition of energy rule .    in sec .",
    "ii , we consider the virial for an arbitrary number of quarks and derive a relativistic virial theorem which relates the total mean @xmath26-momentum of the quarks to that of the glue and an spatial integral over the trace of the quark energy - momentum tensor . in sec .",
    "iii , we show that for a hadron made of light quarks ( i.e. , in the limit of vanishing quark masses ) obeying wilson scaling , the mean energy carried by the quarks is equal to that carried by the glue . in sec .",
    "iv , we review briefly the well known data on the `` parton '' distributions in the best studied case of the proton confirming our theoretical results obtained in sec .",
    "we close the paper with some concluding remarks in sec .  v.",
    "if the positions and momenta of the quarks are denoted by @xmath27 and if , in the center of mass frame , the positions and momenta of the quarks are bounded , then the virial @xmath28 is also bounded .",
    "the internal ( center of mass frame ) wave function @xmath29 of a hadron having mass @xmath30 obeys @xmath31 hence , @xmath32\\psi \\right>=0.\\ ] ] the rate of change ( in time ) of the virial eq.(10 ) obeys @xmath33 where the velocity @xmath34= ( \\partial h_j/\\partial { \\bf p}_j)=c{\\bf \\alpha } _ j\\ ] ] is calculated from the dirac hamiltonian @xmath35 of the @xmath36 quark .",
    "if the quark mass is @xmath37 , then @xmath38 the force on the @xmath36 quark @xmath39\\ ] ] is calculated from a potential of the binding glue @xmath40 the potential obeys the wilson scaling eqs.(8 ) and ( 9 ) .    from the nature of the dirac hamiltonian eq.(15 )",
    ", it follows that @xmath41 while the euler equation corresponding to eq.(8 ) is well known to be @xmath42 the mean energy of the quarks , @xmath43 and the mean energy of the glue , @xmath44 are related via eqs.(13 ) and ( 18 - 21 ) as in the following    * virial theorem : * @xmath45    the second term on the right hand side of eq.(22 ) is related to the trace of the quark contribution @xmath46 to the mean local hadron stress - energy tensor ; i.e. @xmath47 the trace of the stress - energy tensor is simply expressed in terms of the local quark energy density @xmath48 and the local quark pressure @xmath49 ; i.e. @xmath50 thus , the virial theorem follows from eqs.(22 - 24 ) to read as @xmath51    finally , let us here relax the restriction of working in the hadron center of mass frame . in terms of the total four momentum of the hadron ( @xmath52 ) , @xmath53 where the four vector `` 3-volume components '' are defined via @xmath54 the above manifestly lorentz invariant form of the virial theorem eq.(26 ) is the central result of this section .",
    "for hadrons made up of light quarks , one expects the `` ultra - relativistic '' quark gas result @xmath55 .",
    "the precise theorem is that in the limit of vanishing quark masses @xmath56 eqs.(9 ) , ( 25 ) and ( 28 ) imply the equipartition of the hadron rest energy @xmath57 in wilson loop string models ; i.e. @xmath58    to see simply how eq.(29 ) arises , let us consider a simple model of mesons made up of a quark and an anti - quark and let us employ the string potential of eq.(7 ) ; @xmath59 where @xmath9 is the length of the string .",
    "the ultra - relativistic quark kinetic energy corresponding to a meson angular momentum @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 .",
    "the mass of the meson may be estimated by the minimum energy principle @xcite @xmath62 the physical string length @xmath63 then obeys @xmath64 while the mass squared determines a linear angular momentum trajectory @xmath65 for the above ( perhaps overly ) simple model , note that @xmath66 .",
    "thus , eq.(29 ) holds true .    however , the equipartition of energy in eq.(29 ) is _ not _ a trivial physics result .",
    "different models yield different partitions of the energy .",
    "for some `` bag '' models,@xcite @xmath67 , or more generally @xmath68 applying the virial theorem for this case yields @xmath69 on the basis of eqs.(29 ) and ( 34 ) and the discussion in sec .",
    "iv , it appears that string models are experimentally favored over bag models .",
    "our results from secs . ii and iii are that for light quark bound states such as the proton and the pion , we expect the @xmath70 rule for the momenta carried by the quarks and the glue . here",
    "we shall briefly discuss an experimental verification of this fact for the proton in the context of the parton model .",
    "as well known ( see for example @xcite@xcite ) , one defines a quark density @xmath71 , and antiquark density @xmath72 and a gluon density @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the fraction of the proton momentum .",
    "what has been found experimentally is that @xmath75 \\approx 0.5 .\\ ] ]    to quote ref.[9 ] , `` [ the above ] is an experimental result .",
    "it indicates that the quarks carry about @xmath76 of the proton s momentum .",
    "the rest is attributed to gluon constituents . ''",
    "there are similar albeit less accurate data for the pion structure function as well showing the equipartition of the pion momenta into quarks and glue .",
    "we expect sizeable deviations from the equipartition for large quark masses .",
    "present data for heavy quarks are not sufficiently accurate to allow for a quantitative test .",
    "in the preceding , we have derived a relativistic virial theorem valid for a generic hadron . for",
    "homogeneously scaling potentials , it connects the mean energy carried by the quarks , the glue and the trace of quark energy - momentum tensor integrated over the hadronic volume . for `` ordinary '' hadrons such as the pion and the nucleon , made of light quarks",
    ", it leads to the pleasing result that for the string model ( which satisfies the wilson area conjecture ) the mean quark energy equals the mean energy carried by the glue .",
    "there is ample experimental evidence via the quark and gluon densities verifying this @xmath70 rule for the case of the proton .",
    "( a less precise but positive confirmation is also found experimentally for the pion ) .",
    "the `` bag models '' generally fail in this respect .",
