    "in this work we calculate the free energy of qcd on the lattice , up to three loops in perturbation theory .",
    "we employ wilson gluons and the @xmath2 improved sheikholeslami - wohlert ( clover )  @xcite action for fermions .",
    "the purpose of this action is to reduce finite lattice spacing effects , leading to a faster approach to the continuum .",
    "dynamical simulations employing the clover action are currently in progress by the cp - pacs / jlqcd  @xcite and ukqcdsf  @xcite collaborations and therefore perturbative studies of properties of the qcd action with clover quarks are worthy of being undertaken .",
    "the free energy , in the simpler case of wilson fermions , was studied in  @xcite .",
    "the free energy in qcd on the lattice can be related to the average plaquette .",
    "the results find several applications , for example : a ) in improved scaling schemes , using an appropriately defined effective coupling which depends on the average plaquette ( see , e. g. , @xcite ) , b ) in long standing efforts , starting with  @xcite , to determine the value of the gluon condensate , c ) in studies of the interquark potential  @xcite , and d ) as a test of perturbation theory , at its limits of applicability .    indeed , regarding point ( d ) above , the plaquette expectation value is a prototype for additive renormalization of a composite , dimensionful operator .",
    "the vacuum diagrams contributing to such a calculation are power divergent in the lattice spacing and may well dominate over any nonperturbative signal in a numerical simulation .",
    "starting from the wilson formulation of qcd on the lattice , with the addition of the clover ( sw ) fermion term , the action reads in standard notation : @xmath3 , \\nonumber \\\\ s_f & = & \\sum_{f}\\sum_{x } ( 4r+m_b)\\bar{\\psi}_{f}(x)\\psi_f(x )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -{1\\over 2}\\sum_{f}\\sum_{x,\\,\\mu } \\left [   \\bar{\\psi}_{f}(x)\\left ( r - \\gamma_\\mu\\right ) u_{\\mu}(x)\\psi_f(x+\\hat{\\mu})+ \\bar{\\psi}_f(x+\\hat{\\mu})\\left ( r + \\gamma_\\mu\\right ) u_{\\mu}(x)^\\dagger \\psi_{f}(x)\\right]\\nonumber \\\\ & & + { i\\over 4}\\,c_{\\rm sw}\\,\\sum_{f}\\sum_{x,\\,\\mu,\\,\\nu } \\bar{\\psi}_{f}(x ) \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu } { \\hat f}_{\\mu\\nu}(x ) \\psi_f(x ) \\label{latact}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath4    here @xmath5 is the usual product of @xmath1 link variables @xmath6 along the perimeter of a plaquette in the @xmath7-@xmath8 directions , originating at @xmath9 ; @xmath10 denotes the bare coupling constant ; @xmath11 is the wilson parameter , which will be assigned its standard value @xmath12 ; @xmath13 is a flavor index ; @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "powers of the lattice spacing @xmath15 have been omitted and may be directly reinserted by dimensional counting .",
    "the clover coefficient @xmath16 is a free parameter for the purposes of the present calculation and our results will be presented as a polynomial in @xmath16 , with coefficients which we compute .",
    "preferred values for @xmath16 have been suggested by both perturbative ( 1-loop )  @xcite and non - perturbative  @xcite studies .",
    "we use the standard covariant gauge - fixing term  @xcite ; in terms of the vector field @xmath17 @xmath18 $ ] , it reads : @xmath19    having to compute a gauge invariant quantity , we chose to work in the feynman gauge , @xmath20 .",
    "covariant gauge fixing produces the following action for the ghost fields @xmath21 and @xmath22    @xmath23 + \\frac{i\\,g_0}{2 } \\,\\left[q_{\\mu}(x ) , \\delta^+_{\\mu}\\omega(x ) \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\   & & - \\frac{g_0 ^ 2}{12 } \\,\\left[q_{\\mu}(x ) , \\left [ q_{\\mu}(x ) , \\delta^+_{\\mu}\\omega(x)\\right]\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & &   - \\frac{g_0 ^ 4}{720 } \\,\\left[q_{\\mu}(x ) , \\left[q_{\\mu}(x ) , \\left[q_{\\mu}(x ) , \\left [ q_{\\mu}(x ) , \\delta^+_{\\mu}\\omega(x)\\right]\\right]\\right]\\right ] + \\cdots \\bigr)\\biggr\\ } , \\nonumber\\\\ & \\delta^+_{\\mu}\\omega(x ) \\equiv \\omega(x +",
    "{ \\hat \\mu } ) - \\omega(x)&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    finally the change of integration variables from links to vector fields yields a jacobian that can be rewritten as the usual measure term @xmath24 in the action :    @xmath25    in @xmath26 and @xmath27 we have written out only terms relevant to our computation .",
    "the full action is :    @xmath28    the average value of the action density , @xmath29 , is directly related to the average plaquette . for the gluon part",
    "we have : @xmath30 as for @xmath31 , it is trivial in any action which is bilinear in the fermion fields , and leads to : @xmath32 ( @xmath33 : number of fermion flavors ) .",
    "we will calculate @xmath34 in perturbation theory : @xmath35    the @xmath36-loop coefficient can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the contribution of diagrams without fermion loops and @xmath39 comes from diagrams containing fermions .",
    "the coefficients @xmath38 have been known for some time up to 3 loops  @xcite ( also in 3 dimensions  @xcite , where they are applied to `` magnetostatic '' qcd  @xcite and to dimensionally reduced qcd  @xcite ) .",
    "independent estimates of higher loop coefficients have also been obtained using stochastic perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the fermionic coefficients @xmath39 are known to 2 loops for overlap fermions  @xcite and up to 3 loops for wilson fermions  @xcite ; in the present work we extend this computation to the clover action .",
    "the calculation of @xmath40 proceeds most conveniently by computing first the free energy @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the full partition function : @xmath43 \\exp(-s )   \\label{z}\\ ] ] then , @xmath34 is extracted through @xmath44 in particular , the perturbative expansion of @xmath45 : @xmath46 leads immediately to the relations : @xmath47",
    "a total of 62 feynman diagrams contribute to the present calculation , up to three loops .",
    "the first 36 diagrams are totally gluonic , and the others have both gluon and fermion contributions ; these are shown in appendix a. the involved algebra of lattice perturbation theory was carried out using our computer package in mathematica . the value for each diagram is computed numerically for a sequence of finite lattices , with typical size @xmath48 .",
    "certain diagrams must be grouped into infrared - finite sets , before extrapolating their values to infinite lattice size ( diagrams 11 + 12 + 13 , 22 through 36 , 43 + 53 , 44 + 52 + 58 , 46 + 56 , 51 + 57 , 55 + 60 , 61 + 62 ) .",
    "extrapolation leads to a ( small ) systematic error , which is estimated quite accurately ; a consise description of the procedure is provided in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "diagrams in the shape of a triangular pyramid ( 18 , 19 , 20 , 49 , 50 ) are the most cpu demanding , since integration over the 3 loop momenta can not be factorized ; these diagrams were necessarily evaluated for smaller @xmath49 , but fortunately @xmath50 was already sufficient for a very stable extrapolation in these cases . diagram 40 vanishes identically by color antisymmetry .",
    "we have calculated @xmath56 , @xmath57 for typical values of the lagrangian ( unrenormalized ) fermion mass parameter @xmath0 , which is connected to the familiar hopping expansion parameter @xmath58 .",
    "our results are listed in appendix b. a complete _ per diagram _ breakdown of the results would be far too lengthy to present ; instead , for potential comparisons , we provide in appendix b a breakdown only for a particular value of @xmath0 .",
    "we list below some examples of values for @xmath34 , setting @xmath61 .",
    "for @xmath63 we have : @xmath64 for two degenerate flavors ( @xmath62 ) and @xmath65 ( corresponding to @xmath66 ) : @xmath67 c_{\\rm sw } = 2.0 : \\ & e_g = ( 1/3)\\ , g^2 & + 0.013663456(3 ) g^4 & + 0.0110200(13 ) g^6 \\end{array } \\label{m-0.518106}\\ ] ] for @xmath62 and @xmath68 : @xmath69 c_{\\rm sw } = 1.3 : \\   & e_g = ( 1/3)\\ , g^2 & + 0.025219798(9 ) \\ g^4 & + 0.0129659(5 ) \\",

    "the detailed results , tabulated in appendix b for arbitrary values of @xmath71 , @xmath33 , @xmath16 , show a very smooth behaviour as a function of @xmath0 ; consequently , one is able to reconstruct @xmath34 also for arbitrary values of @xmath0 by naive interpolation , to excellent precision .",
    "figure 4 depicts all diagrams contributing to the free energy at 1 loop ( diagram 1 ) , 2 loops ( 2 - 6 , 37 - 38 ) , and 3 loops ( 7 - 36 , 39 - 62 ) .",
    "solid ( curly , dashed ) lines represent fermions ( gluons , ghosts ) , and the filled square is the contribution from the measure part of the action . the filled circle , corresponding to the non - fermionic part of the 1-loop gluon self - energy , is given in figure 5",
    ".        tables i - iv provide a _ per diagram _ breakdown of our results , at a given value of @xmath0 ( @xmath68 ) , in order to allow for potential comparisons and cross checks .",
    "the total results for the coefficients @xmath56 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 are listed in tables v - viii , respectively , for a wide selection of @xmath0 values which are used in the literature .",
