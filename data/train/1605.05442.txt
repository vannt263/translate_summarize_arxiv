    "our real world is composed of a huge variety of systems , which function in various layers , such as technology , society , and biology , and are continuously growing in unstable environments .",
    "it is thus of great importance to capture the essence of these complex critical systems .",
    "the _ graph _",
    "@xcite or _ network _ is one of the most powerful tools , where the constituents of the systems are regarded as nodes and the interactions between the nodes as links .",
    "since it has been detected that networks representing real - world systems exhibit small - world properties @xcite and scale free ( heterogeneous ) properties @xcite in general , various topological characteristics have been demonstrated and salient results have been reported @xcite .",
    "one of the most important properties of a network is its robustness , that is , its tolerance to the malfunction of some nodes and/or links , which is frequently evaluated as an aggregated property , characterized as the structural phase transition of the emergence of a giant component ( gc ) @xcite .",
    "although vast studies have been conducted in this field , research remains insufficient , because in most studies network patterns were projected as a single layer and the effect exerted by the fact that real - world systems couple with one another was not realized .",
    "for the purposes of analyzing real - world networks more essentially , the concept of _ multilayer networks _ was developed and is considered a new paradigm of complex network science @xcite .",
    "the seminal work on multilayer networks is the analysis of the robustness of interdependent networks presented in @xcite .",
    "a mutually connected gc ( mcgc ) consisting of nodes that belong to a gc in each of all the layers collapses even if only a portion of the nodes has initially failed in one layer , triggering a chain of failures ( called the cascade phenomenon ) that spreads over all networks .",
    "this type of model may in fact be the most dependable because real - world systems in general are becoming increasingly dependent on one another @xcite .",
    "a different class of multiplex networks consists of those that couple with each other with antagonistic interlayer interactions , which are called antagonistic networks .",
    "several papers were published with regard to robustness of antagonistic networks with neutral degree - degree correlations @xcite .",
    "the theoretical framework was presented for analyzing the robustness on duplex antagonistic networks without initial failures in @xcite and later extended to include the failures in @xcite .",
    "although it was of surprise that these models exhibited the first order transition in the gc size , the definition of the antagonistic property of interlinks was artificial to some extent , in particular for numerical experiments . in our model the property of interlinks",
    "is defined simply at microscopic level : nodes that belong to the gc deactivate their replica nodes , while the other nodes , which do not belong to the gc , activate their replica nodes .",
    "in addition , we explicitly define that initial failures occur in layer @xmath0 .",
    "although our model is defined in a somewhat abstract manner , one may be able to regard it as a family of graph models for ecological systems @xcite .",
    "employing duplex networks instead of a single network , we represent habitat patches of two categories of species ( endangered species and the invasive ones ) and interactions in and between them ; the habitats of endangered species and those of invaders are projected on layer @xmath0 and layer @xmath1 respectively and the gc in each layer represents the largest and most significant habitat of the relevant layer .",
    "each interlayer link represents the antagonistic interaction because the invaders prey on the endangered species , while the latter are conserved , thus eradication program expels the former .    in this paper , we analyze the resilience of antagonistic duplex networks that suffer from failures , in terms of the following three factors : ( i ) the type of the initial failures ; ( ii ) the remaining effect of the initial failures ; and ( iii ) degree - degree correlations .",
    "two scenarios are examined featuring the two types of initial node failures in the the first layer @xmath0 : nodes randomly fail ( rfs ) or high degree nodes selectively fail , called targeted attacks ( tas ) .",
    "the result of the initial failures propagate to the confronting layer @xmath1 , which causes node failures at the second stage and the outcome return to the layer @xmath0 . at the third stage ,",
    "two possibilities are considered for the remaining effect of the initial damage . in one scenario , which is referred to as the _ quenched _ setting ( case q ) , the effect of the initial damage remains , such that failed nodes can not become active again .",
    "in contrast , in the second scenario , termed the _ free _ setting ( case f ) , all the nodes are free of the initial damage , which also implies that the nodes can be reactivated with the aid of replica nodes .    in the above - described realistic scenario ,",
    "case f corresponds to the situation in which endangered species can recover , while in case q , they can not even though invaders disappear in the area . in both cases percolation processes exhibit periodic phenomena , which were also reported in different model @xcite .",
    "in addition , we consider the effects of two types of degree - degree correlations , those between nodes within a layer ( intralayer degree - degree correlations ) and those between replica nodes ( interlayer degree - degree correlations ) . in general ,",
    "degrees in real - world networks are correlated @xcite , and therefore , the influence of degree - degree correlations is considered one of the most important topics in the research on multilayer networks @xcite .    as the main part of this paper , we address the development of an analytical framework based on the cavity method developed in statistical mechanics @xcite , which is categorized as a mean field approach @xcite , supposing a locally tree - like structure and utilizing bethe - peierls approximation . in our framework",
    ", we first describe the flow for computing gc size from a microscopic viewpoint , the formulation of which is extended to a macroscopic viewpoint and the expected gc size is analytically evaluated solving a set of self - consistent equations numerically .",
    "unfortunately , the results obtained in this fashion deviate from numerical ones , in particular in case f. the cause of the discrepancy lies in the assumption of self - averaging property that nodes of the same degree have equivalent statistical property though at each single instance local states of some nodes , which are affected from the hysteresis in the layer , deterministically contribute to global property of the relevant layer , namely gc size .",
    "the technique to efface the influence of the hysteresis is implicitly used for robustness analysis of multilayer interdependent networks @xcite and antagonistic networks @xcite . however ,",
    "this is not valid in the latter case , unlike the former case : some inactive nodes are regarded active , which may makes some of them belong to the gc , if it exists . although the fraction of these nodes is almost negligible @xcite , their existence may significantly influence the critical behavior of the system , namely whether the manner of the percolation transition is continuous @xcite or discontinuous @xcite . in keeping with the periodic phenomena",
    ", we heuristically describe the gc size at the microscopic level and extend it to the macroscopic one , the utility of which is confirmed comparing with the numerical ones .",
    "the percolation transition of each layer turns out to be continuous in both cases q and f in our model ; in particular , that of layer @xmath0 depends on the first stage and the critical point is determined only by intralayer topologies in layer @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the gc size depends on both interlayer and intralayer correlations , in particular the gc size in layer @xmath0 exceeds about half of the layer size .",

    "in this section , we present a brief outline of our model of antagonistic networks consisting of layers ( networks ) @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where the number of nodes in each layer is @xmath2 .",
    "they are generated separately in some initial configuration , where no isolated node exists in either network prior to the failure process .",
    "our model is seeded by initial damages that destroy a portion of the nodes in layer @xmath0 , chosen uniformly at random or targeted ( selected degree - dependent randomly ) with probability @xmath3 . as the result of the first stage",
    ", a gc may remain in layer @xmath0 , the order of size of which is typically @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 at the critical point exactly ) @xcite .",
    "we define that nodes that belong to the gc in layer @xmath0 deactivate their replica nodes in layer @xmath1 , while all the other nodes that do not belong to the gc activate their replica nodes which causes the failure of nodes in layer @xmath1 at the second stage , resulting in a gc in layer @xmath1 that differs from the gc in layer @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , all the nodes that belong to the gc in layer @xmath1 deactivate their replica nodes , while the rest of nodes activate their replica nodes .",
    "the difference between cases q and f corresponds to whether the initial damages remain or not in layer @xmath0 at the third stage : in case q , nodes are affected from both the initial damages and layer @xmath1 , while in case f , nodes are free from the initial damage and only affected from layer @xmath1 .",

    "this guarantees that the nodes in layer @xmath0 are active at the start of stage @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , the network topology is unchanged from stage @xmath8 . therefore , it is ensured that the nodes belong to the gc after the @xmath10 percolation process , and repeating this argument concludes that the nodes continue to constitute the gc for ever at stages @xmath11 .",

    "<S> in this study , we investigate the resilience of duplex networked layers ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) coupled with antagonistic interlinks , each layer of which inhibits its counterpart at the microscopic level , changing the following factors : whether the influence of the initial failures in @xmath0 remains ( quenched ( case q ) ) or not ( free ( case f ) ) ; the effect of intralayer degree - degree correlations in each layer and interlayer degree - degree correlations ; and the type of the initial failures , such as random failures ( rfs ) or targeted attacks ( tas ) . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate that the percolation processes repeat in both cases q and f , although only in case f are nodes that initially failed reactivated . to analytically evaluate the resilience of each layer </S>",
    "<S> , we develop a methodology based on the cavity method for deriving the size of a giant component ( gc ) . </S>",
    "<S> strong hysteresis , which is ignored in the standard cavity analysis , is observed in the repetition of the percolation processes particularly in case f. to handle this , we heuristically modify interlayer messages for macroscopic analysis , the utility of which is verified by numerical experiments . the percolation transition in each layer is continuous in both cases q and f. we also analyze the influences of degree - degree correlations on the robustness of layer @xmath0 , in particular for the case of tas . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis indicates that the critical fraction of initial failures that makes the gc size in layer @xmath0 vanish depends only on its intralayer degree - degree correlations . </S>",
    "<S> although our model is defined in a somewhat abstract manner , it may have relevance to ecological systems that are composed of endangered species ( layer @xmath0 ) and invaders ( layer @xmath1 ) , the former of which are damaged by the latter whereas the latter are exterminated in the areas where the former are active . </S>"
