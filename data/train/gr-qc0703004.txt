    "investigation of models of the early universe has a long history ( see e.g. refs .",
    "one of the basic direction is consideration of classical scalar fields . for such type of models",
    "the necessary inflationary evolution can be ensured by a corresponding choice of energy - momentum tensor which is equivalent to the hydrodynamic equation of state @xmath0 . in this case",
    "the exponential expansion of the universe is realized , and its size increase from the planck value up to macroscopic one .",
    "the subsequent redistribution of the field energy between kinetic and potential parts leads to fast oscillations of the field ( the so - called scalaron stage  @xcite ) and to realization of the effective equation of state @xmath1 .",
    "such fast oscillations with the planck energy density provide mass creation of elementary particles with subsequent filling of the universe by hot plasma . at the corresponding choice of initial parameters ,",
    "such a simple model solves the principal problems cosmology ( causality , homogeneity , flatness , e.t.c ) .    in this letter",
    "we offer the model of the early universe using the special form of the potential energy of scalar field : @xmath2 here @xmath3 are two real scalar fields with masses @xmath4 and self - coupling constants @xmath5 accordingly , @xmath6 is a normalization constant .",
