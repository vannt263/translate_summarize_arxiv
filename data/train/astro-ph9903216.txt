    "stars and ionized gas provide independent probes of the mass distribution in a galaxy . the comparison between their kinematics is particularly important in dynamically hot systems ( i.e. whose projected velocity dispersion is comparable to rotation ) .",
    "in fact in elliptical galaxies and bulges the ambiguities about orbital anisotropies can lead to considerable uncertainties in the mass modeling ( e.g. binney & mamon 1982 ; rix et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the mass distributions inferred from stellar and gaseous kinematics are usually in good agreement for discs ( where both tracers can be considered on nearly circular orbits ) , but often appear discrepant for bulges ( e.g. fillmore , boroson & dressler 1986 ; kent 1988 ; kormendy & westpfahl 1989 ; bertola et al .",
    "there are several possibilities to explain these discrepant mass estimates in galactic bulges :    1 .",
    "if bulges have a certain degree of triaxiality , depending on the viewing angle the gas on closed orbits can either move faster or slower than in the ` corresponding ' axisymmetric case ( bertola , rubin & zeilinger 1989 ) .",
    "similarly , the predictions of the triaxial stellar models deviate from those in the axisymmetric case : whenever @xmath4 , then @xmath5 ; 2 .",
    "most of the previous modeling assumes that the gas is dynamically cold and therefore rotates at the local circular speed on the galactic equatorial plane . if in bulges the gas velocity dispersion @xmath6 is not negligible ( e.g. cinzano & van der marel 1994 hereafter cvdm94 ; rix et al . 1995 ; bertola et al .",
    "1995b ) , the gas rotates slower than the local circular velocity due to its dynamical pressure support .",
    "cvdm94 showed explicitly for the e4/s0a galaxy ngc  2974 that the gas and star kinematics agree taking into account for the gas velocity dispersion . furthermore ,",
    "if @xmath6 is comparable to the observed streaming velocity , the spatial gas distribution can no longer be modeled as a disc ; 3 .",
    "forces other than gravity ( such as magnetic fields , interactions with stellar mass loss envelopes and the hot gas component ) might act on the ionized gas ( e.g. mathews 1990 ) .    in this paper",
    "we pursue the second of these explanations by building for ngc  4036 dynamical models which take into account both for the random motions and the three - dimensional spatial distribution of the ionized gas .",
    "ngc  4036 has been classified s0@xmath7(8)/sa in rsa ( sandage & tammann 1981 ) and s0@xmath8 in rc3 ( de vaucouleurs et al .",

    "it forms a wide pair with ngc  4041 with a separation of @xmath9 corresponding to 143 kpc at their mean redshift distance of 29 mpc ( sandage & bedke 1994 ) . in the carnegie atlas of galaxies ( hereafter cag ) sandage & bedke ( 1994 ) describe it as characterized by an irregular pattern of dust lanes threaded through the disc in an ` embryonic ' spiral pattern indicating a mixed s0/sa form ( see panel  60 in cag ) .",

    "a gaussian fit to field stars in the resulting image yielded a measurement of the seeing point spread function ( psf ) fwhm of @xmath29 .",
    "the sky subtraction and elliptical fitting of the galaxy isophotes were performed by means of the astronomical images analysis package ( aiap ) developed at the osservatorio astronomico di padova ( fasano 1990 ) .",

    "the abrupt variation in position angle ( @xmath57 ) observed inside @xmath30 leads to an isophote twist that can be interpreted as due to a slight triaxiality of the inner regions of the stellar bulge .",
    "anyway this variation has to be considered carefully due to the presence of dust pattern in these regions which are revealed by hst imaging ( see fig .  [ fig_hstphotometry ] ) .",

    "indeed to explain the luminosity of the optical emission lines measured for nearby ellipticals , mathews ( 1990 ) estimated that the ionized gas ejected from the orbiting stars merges with the hot interstellar medium in at least @xmath244 yr .",
    "if the gas clouds have at the beginning the same kinematics of their parent stars , this lifetime is sufficiently long to let the gaseous clouds ( which start with the same kinematics of their parent stars ) to acquire an own kinematical behaviour due to the deceleration produced by the drag force of the interstellar diffuse medium .",
    "the lifetime of the ionized gas nebulae is shorter than @xmath245 years if magnetics effects on gas kinematics are ignored ( as in our model b ) .    to have some qualitative insights in understanding the effects of a drag force on the gas kinematics we studied the case of a gaseous nebula moving in the spherical potential @xmath246 generated by an homogeneous mass distribution of density @xmath247 and which",

    "no contribution derives from the radial component @xmath263 of their velocities .",

    "the radial components of the cloudlet velocities ( typically of 30 - 40 , see fig .",
    "[ fig_drag ] ) are crucial to explain the velocity dispersion profile and to understand how the difference between the observed velocity dispersions and the model b predictions arises . if the clouds are decelerated by the drag force their orbits become more radially extended and the velocity ellipsoids acquire a radial anisotropy .",
    "this is a general effect and it is true not only in our case , in which the clouds initially moved onto circular orbits .",
    "so we expect ( in the region of the gaseous spheroid ) the observed velocity dispersion profile to decrease steeper than the one predicted by the isotropic model b. in fact inside @xmath269 the f97 ionized gas data show that the gas velocity dispersion does not already exceed 50 , even if its rotation curve falls below the circular velocities inferred from the stellar kinematics .",
    "given we do not know the the lifetime and the density of the cloudlets we can not make a definite prediction .    the drag effects could explain the differences between the observed and predicted velocities , if the decreasing of the tangential velocities ( showed in fig .",

    "a proper luminosity - weighted integration of the tangential velocities of nebulae along the line - of - sight has to be taken into account for the gaseous spheroid .",

    "+ moreover ( in the general case ) , the clouds are not all starting at the local circular velocity and also at any given radius we find either ` younger ' clouds ( just shed from stars ) and ` older ' clouds , which are coming from farther regions of the gaseous spheroid and are going to be thermalized . due to the nature of the drag force ( acting much more efficiently on fast - moving particles ) , it is easy to understand that the fast ` younger ' clouds will soon leave their harbours , while the slow ` older ' clouds will spend much more time crossing these regions .",
    "for instance , in the case of nebulae shed at the local circular velocity on a given plane ( described by eqs .",
    "[ eq_moto1 ] and [ eq_moto2 ] and shown fig  [ fig_drag ] ) at @xmath270 kpc ( where the circular velocity is @xmath271 ) we found that quite an half of the gas cloudlets are coming from regions between 0.97 and 1.1 kpc with tangential velocity between 150  and 127 .",

    "[ fig_halpha ] , it is not clear .",
    "the modeling of the stellar and gas kinematics in ngc  4036 shows that the observed velocities of the ionized gas , moving in the gravitational potential determined from the stellar kinematics , can not be explained without taking the gas velocity dispersion into account . in the inner regions of ngc  4036",

    "<S> we present the kinematics and photometry of the stars and of the ionized gas near the centre of the s0 galaxy ngc4036 . </S>",

    "<S> the observed gas rotation curve falls well short of the predicted circular velocity . over a comparable radial region </S>",
    "<S> the observed gas velocity dispersion is far higher than the one expected from thermal motions or small scale turbulence , corroborating that the gas can not be following the streamlines of nearly closed orbits . </S>",
    "<S> we explore several avenues to understand the dynamical state of the gas : ( 1 ) we treat the gas as a collisionless ensemble of cloudlets and apply the jeans equation to it ; this modeling shows that inside @xmath1 the gas velocity dispersion is just high enough to explain quantitatively the absence of rotation . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) alternatively , we explore whether the gas may arise from the ` just shed ' mass - loss envelopes of the bulge stars , in which case their kinematics should simply mimic that of the stars . </S>",
    "<S> he latter approach matches the data better than ( 1 ) , but still fails to explain the low velocity dispersion _ and _ slow rotation velocity of the gas for @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) finally , we explore , whether drag forces on the ionized gas may aid in explaining its peculiar kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> while all these approaches provide a much better description of the data than cold gas on closed orbits , we do not yet have a definitive model to describe the observed gas kinematics at all radii . </S>",
