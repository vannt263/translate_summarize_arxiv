    "the most important terms in such transport equations are those describing spatial diffusion along and across a mean magnetic field .",
    "parallel and perpendicular diffusion coefficients are mostly controlled by the turbulent magnetic fields of the plasma .",
    "first treatments of perpendicular diffusion were based on quasi - linear theory ( see jokipii 1966 ) which can be understood as a first - order perturbation theory . however , perturbation theory is usually based on the assumption that there is a small parameter .",
    "it is often stated in the literature ( see , e.g. , schlickeiser 2002 ) that this small parameter is the magnetic field ratio @xmath0 ( here @xmath1 is the total turbulent field and @xmath2 is the mean magnetic field ) . apart from the problem that this magnetic field ratio is usually not small in astrophysical scenarios , it was shown in the literature that a small value of @xmath0 alone does not justify the quasi - linear approach ( see , e.g. , shalchi 2009 for a detailed discussion of the problems associated with quasi - linear theory ) .    because quasi - linear theory is problematic ,",

    "however , nlgc theory does often not provide the correct result .",
    "this is in particular the case for slab turbulence , two - component turbulence with a dominant slab contribution , or three - dimensional turbulence with small kubo numbers .",

    "unlt theory uses an approach based on the cr fokker - planck equation in order to avoid simple approximations of such correlations .",

    "therefore , slab modes do not explicitly contribute to the perpendicular diffusion coefficient .",

    "[ q3l1 ] . clearly we can see that now the discrepancies between the different theories are much smaller .",
    "however , there is still a factor @xmath64 or even @xmath65 between the different theoretical results .",
    "again the observed effect can explain the value @xmath15 assumed in matthaeus et al .",
    "we also made calculations for smaller values of the magnetic field ratio @xmath0 to find that the effect coming from the implicit slab contribution is weaker .",
    "but here we have used @xmath62 and @xmath58 to explore the influence of the bendover scales . ]",
    "in the current paper we have revisited the problem of perpendicular diffusion of energetic particles in two - component turbulence . whereas it was shown",
    "before that the slab modes do not explicitly contribute to the perpendicular diffusion coefficient , we explored the implicit contribution in the current paper .",
    "we have derived the modified non - linear integral equation ( [ nlgc2 ] ) which can be approximated by eq .",
    "( [ finalapprox ] ) .",
    "this modification should provide another improvement compared to the original nlgc theory developed in matthaeus et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and the extended nlgc theory of shalchi ( 2006 ) .",
    "compared to earlier versions of the nlgc theory , the modified equations ( [ nlgc2 ] ) or ( [ finalapprox ] ) are not more difficult to evaluate numerically .    in figs .",
    "[ q0l10]-[q3l1 ] we have shown the perpendicular mean free path versus the parallel mean free path for different values of the scale ratio @xmath63 and different values of the energy range spectral index @xmath46 .",
    "both mean free paths are normalized with respect to the two - dimensional bendover scale @xmath47 .",
    "it can easily be seen that , in general , the implicit slab contribution reduces the perpendicular mean free path .",
    "matthaeus et al .",
    "( 2003 ) used @xmath54 and @xmath55 in their work and they compared the original nlgc theory with test - particle simulations .",
    "they found a difference between analytical theory and simulations but this difference can be balanced out by using the correction factor @xmath14 and by setting @xmath15 . in the current paper a possible explanation for this value",
    "is provided .",
    "the implicit contribution from the slab modes reduces the perpendicular mean free path as required to achieve agreement with simulations .",
    "the correction factor @xmath14 is no longer needed .    for @xmath60 and @xmath62 , which is in agreement with the values suggested by matthaeus et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we find a stronger effect .",
    "in particular for long parallel mean free paths , a strong reduction of the perpendicular mean free path can be observed .",
    "another parameter which influences the reduction discussed here , is the scale ratio @xmath63 .",
    "if this ratio is small , a stronger effect can be observed . for equal bendover scales , however , the perpendicular mean free path is only about a factor @xmath64 shorter as the one computed by using the original nlgc theory .",
    "a further theory for perpendicular diffusion was presented in shalchi ( 2010 ) where the unified non - linear transport ( unlt ) theory was developed . in the following",
    "we discuss which theory has to be used for which case .",
    "* solar wind turbulence is often approximated by a slab/2d composite model which is also known as two - component turbulence .",
    "we suggest to use the extended nlgc theory with implicit slab contribution developed in the current paper for this specific turbulence model .",
    "this theory is represented by eq .",
    "( [ nlgc2 ] ) which can be well approximated by eq .",
    "( [ finalapprox ] ) . * for full three - dimensional turbulence , the original nlgc theory , the extended theory and the approach developed in the current paper can not be used . for this case the unlt theory represented by eq .",
    "( [ unlt ] ) should provide an accurate description of perpendicular diffusion . in this case",
    "a critical parameter is the _ kubo number _ ( see shalchi 2015 for more details ) .",
    "the integral equation derived in the current paper should provide an accurate analytical description of perpendicular diffusion in two - component turbulence .",
    "it is straightforward to include further effects such as dynamical turbulence . in this case",
    "another term would occur in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ nlgc2 ] ) which would be associated with the correlation time of the two - dimensional modes .",
    "the situation is more complicated , however , if there is also a dynamical turbulence effect associated with the slab modes because in this case the explicit contribution of the slab modes can be diffusive ( see , e.g. , shalchi 2014 ) .      * to understand the acceleration of particles due to turbulence ( see , e.g. , lynn et al .",
    "2014 ) ; * for solar modulation studies ( see , e.g. , alania et al .",
