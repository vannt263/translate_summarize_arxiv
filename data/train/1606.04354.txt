    "the ability to efficiently respond to chemical stimuli is essential for the survival of many animal species , ranging from prokaryotic cells to much more complex organisms such as insects or birds . at the microscale , the mechanism which allows organisms to move under the influence of chemical stimuli",
    "is called _ chemotaxis _ @xcite .",
    "escherichia coli ( _ e.coli _ ) is one of the model organisms for studies about bacterial chemotaxis @xcite .",
    "thanks to its flagella , activated by bi - directional rotary motors , _",
    "e.coli _ is able to move towards more favorable environments by optimally alternating _ runs _ and _ tumbles _ , which approximately consist of straight lines and random `` turns '' , respectively .    the biochemical mechanisms underlying the chemotactic response of _",
    "e.coli _ are well understood at the molecular level @xcite . a sensing apparatus is devoted to detecting information about the environment , by measuring concentration of chemicals ( generally called , in this context , _ chemoeffectors _ ) .",
    "the arrangement and functioning of the receptors present on _ e.coli _ cellular membrane has been extensively investigated also from the theoretical point of view ( see , @xcite ) .",
    "the information collected by the receptors is transduced to the flagellar motors through the `` messenger molecule '' chey .",
    "the cytoplasmic concentration of its phosphorylated form chey - p varies according to the activity of the membrane receptors .",
    "the chey - p molecule then acts as a regulator of the activity of the flagella by binding to their motors .",
    "these are constituted by rings of fli molecules , arranged in units called _",
    "protomers_. motors are biased by the fli occupancies to rotate counterclockwise ( ccw ) or clockwise ( cw ) . when all the motors are in the ccw state , flagella form a bundle which propels the cell in a forward run ; if at least one motor is in the cw state instead , the bundle splits apart and the cell tumbles .",
    "such mechanism is an example of _ allosteric _ ( or _ indirect _ ) regulation , where the activity of protein complexes changes collectively upon independent binding of external molecules .",
    "the original model which encodes the concept of cooperativity in indirect regulation is the one proposed by monod , wyman and changeux ( mwc ) , commonly known as _ concerted _ model @xcite .    shortly after the paper by monod , wyman and changeux , eigen realized that the concerted model can be extended in order to offer a more graded interplay between the interactions within allosteric complexes and their binding affinities @xcite . when the interactions are local , this generalized model takes the name of _ conformational spread _ model ( see sec.[sec : cs ] ) and is nowadays understood in a statistical mechanical framework in the light of the ferromagnetic ising model , to which it is formally equivalent  @xcite .",
    "these allosteric models have found application in bacterial chemotaxis . in ref.@xcite",
    ", the authors showed how the mwc model is able to reproduce the activity of the flagellar motor of _",
    "e.coli _ as a function of the concentration of cytoplasmic chey - p . @xcite . in this paper",
    ", the authors recognized that the balance between the different chey - p affinity in the two activity states and the size of the motor protein complex was essential in explaining the observed cooperative behaviour of the switch .",
    "the mwc model turned out to be particularly suitable for describing the flagellar switch of _",
    "e.coli_ , in that it accounts for the correct degree of cooperativity with a proper choice of the parameters .",
    "the conformational spread model has been applied to bacterial chemotaxis , both for the membrane receptors @xcite and for the flagellar rotary motors @xcite . by means of a simulation of its associated glauber dynamics @xcite ,",
    "a numerical test of the conformational spread model against the experimental measurement of the rotation speed of the flagella has been performed @xcite .",
    "such analysis showed an excellent agreement between experiments and numerical simulations regarding several aspects of the dynamics , such as the switching time distribution at fixed values of the cytoplasmic chey - p concentration and the sensitivity of the switch upon small variation of chey - p .",
    "a more detailed numerical analysis of the model followed up @xcite , in which also other dynamical properties of the conformational spread model were quantified ( like the locked - state behaviour , namely , the time spent by the motor in a rotational state between two consecutive switches ) and a more precise estimation of the parameters of the model which best fit the experimental results was given .    from the analytical point of view ,",
    "one major obstacle to the study of the conformational spread model resides in the large number of states .",
    "the one - dimensional nature of the ring allows nonetheless for an exact calculation of its partition function at equilibrium via the transfer matrix method @xcite .",
    "however , no analytical treatment of the non - equilibrium behaviour of the model has ever been attempted , to our knowledge .    in this work we present an analytical derivation of the non - equilibrium properties of the conformational spread as a model of the flagellar switch .",
    "our analysis hinges upon the presence of a hierarchy of widely separated time scales , as confirmed by experiments .",
    "due to the strong interaction between the protomers , the coarsening of activity domains in the ring is much faster than the nucleation of a domain , _",
    "i.e. _ the transitions away from the state of all active or all inactive protomers .",
    "this allows the treatment of the whole motor as an allosteric switch in two different activity states ( cw and ccw ) , essentially described by the mwc model .",
    "the nucleation of a domain is in turn much more frequent than the binding / unbinding of a chey - p molecule by one protomer , which makes it possible to operate a quasi - static approximation for the number of bound chey - p and get a description of the slow binding dynamics , to which the activity is slaved .",
    "this separation of time scales allows us to reduce the complexity of the full conformational spread dynamics by progressively averaging the faster degrees of freedom and obtain , in the end , an effective cooperative model which captures the relevant features of the flagellar switch on the slowest time scales",
    ". the effective rates of the emergent `` coarse - grained '' cooperative binding model are expressed in terms of the rates of the original `` microscopic '' conformational spread model . in short ,",
    "the rationale of our approach can be schematically summarized as follows :        the paper is structured as follows : in sec.[sec : cs ] we present the conformational spread model , outlining its equilibrium properties and introducing the dynamics ( satisfying detailed balance ) which is relevant for our study and is the object of our multiscale analysis ; in sec.[sec:2mwc ] we show that , in our experimentally justified assumptions , it is possible to reduce the conformational spread to the concerted mwc model ; a further time - scale separation is the subject matter of sec.[sec:2bd ] , resulting in a cooperative binding model ( formally , a birth - and - death process with site - dependent rates ) that is compared with experiments in sec.[sec : bd ] .",
    "the ring of proteins forming the motor of the _ e.coli _ flagella has been shown to be very well described by the conformational spread model @xcite .",
    "this model consists in @xmath0 identical units , or _ protomers _ , each of which can appear in two different states , active ( @xmath1 ) or inactive ( @xmath2 ) : a protomer in the active state increases the probability of cw rotation of the motor , and of ccw rotation in the inactive state ( see fig.[fig : motor - configs ] ) .    ) and red ( active state , @xmath1 ) , while the grey spots represent the chey - p regulator .",
    "the motor rotates counterclockwise when most of the protomers are in the inactive state ( left ) and clockwise otherwise ( right ) . ]    moreover , each protomer can also bind a _ ligand _ , corresponding to the chey - p chemotactic regulator : we refer to the protomer as in the _ bound _ ( @xmath3 ) state when a ligand is attached to it , or _ unbound _ ( @xmath4 ) otherwise .",
    "therefore , the single protomers can be in 4 different states , corresponding to all the possible _ activity _ and _ binding _ configurations .",
    "the state diagram of a single protomer is depicted in fig.[fig : cs - states ] : the @xmath1 state is energetically more favorable than the @xmath2 state when a ligand is bound and vice versa .",
    "this property ensures that this is a good model for allosteric regulation .",
    "namely , a bias in the activity of the motor depends on the number of bound chey - p molecules : at fixed high concentration of cytoplasmic chey - p ( denoted by @xmath5 ) the motor will most probably spin clockwise .",
    "the state of the full system is specified by the sequence @xmath6 , where the subscripts label the @xmath0 protomers , @xmath7 indicates the activity state @xmath1 or @xmath2 , and @xmath8 stands for the binding state @xmath3 ( @xmath9 ) or @xmath4 ( @xmath10 ) : hence , the number of possible configurations of the ring with @xmath0 protomers is @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , the protomers are coupled via a nearest neighbour interaction , which depends on their activity states _ only _ : in particular , the energy is lowered by a quantity @xmath12 when the neighbouring protomers are in the same activity state @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out that the activity of the ring ( fraction of active protomers ) is more sensitive to small variations of concentration of ligands in the interacting case than in a system of @xmath0 independent protomers .",
    "therefore , the coupling is an essential ingredient which enhances the sensitivity of the whole complex .    ) , while the inactive ( ccw ) has lower energy when in the bound case ( @xmath13 ) ; the binding regulates the activity of the protomers .",
    "the notation and the general scheme has been borrowed from @xcite .",
    "on the right , the coupling energy : the `` ferromagnetic '' coupling ( independent of @xmath8 ) accounts for the high sensitivity of the response of the ring upon binding . ]",
    "the conformational spread model is very reminiscent of the ising model .",
    "in fact , if one associates to each protomer a _ spin _",
    "variable @xmath14 taking value @xmath15 when the protomer is active ( @xmath16 ) , or @xmath17 when it is inactive ( @xmath18 ) , one can represent the states of the system as @xmath19 and the equilibrium properties of the model are determined by the hamiltonian @xmath20 where @xmath12 is a positive constant and @xmath21 is the single - protomer contribution , reproducing the energy diagram in fig.[fig : cs - states ] , @xmath22\\sigma \\nonumber\\\\                  & - \\frac{1}{2}\\bigg[\\varepsilon_i + \\varepsilon_a - ( \\varepsilon_b^a + \\varepsilon_b^i + 2\\mu ) \\ell   \\bigg ] \\fs      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the one in eq.([eq : cs - ham ] ) is an ising hamiltonian with ferromagnetic coupling @xmath12 , where @xmath21 plays the role of an external local magnetic field , set by the occupation @xmath8 ; in eq.([eq : cs - energies ] ) , @xmath23 is the chemical potential , determined by the concentration of chey - p , @xmath5 , by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are reference chemical potential and concentration , respectively .",
    "hereafter , the notation @xmath27 and @xmath7 will be used interchangeably , according to the situation . the partition function",
    "@xmath28 ( where @xmath29 is the inverse temperature and the sum is done over the @xmath30 possible states of the ring of protomers ) has been calculated exactly via transfer matrix approach @xcite .",
    "the analytic results found therein fit very well the experimental curves @xcite of the ligand occupancy ( average fraction of bound protomers ) and the activity ( fraction of protomers in the @xmath1 state ) as a function of the concentration of chey - p .",
    "+ if on one hand the equilibrium properties of the conformational spread model are exactly known , on the other hand a full - fledged analytic treatment of the stochastic dynamics of this model seems difficult . in the definition of the conformational spread model given above",
    ", there is no prescription about the dynamics .",
    "a natural choice which satisfies detailed balance is the glauber - like @xcite markovian dynamics , used in numerical simulations of this model in refs.@xcite .",
    "in such prescription , the process @xmath31 which accounts for the kinetics of the conformational spread model is governed by the master ( kolmogorov ) equation @xmath32 \\comma\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the rates defined as @xmath35 where the product of kronecker @xmath36 indicates that the rates @xmath34 only involve one protomer at a time . each term in eq.([eq : cs - glauber ] ) is obtained from detailed balance up to multiplicative factors @xmath37 and @xmath38 : these constants account for typical time scales of the flipping and binding process , respectively .",
    "the constant @xmath39 in the spin - flip contribution is set by the strength of the coupling , @xmath40 .     from the single - body term in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : cs - ham ] ) :",
    "vertical arrows are labeled by the rates of activation / inactivation ; horizontal arrows by the binding / unbinding ones . ]    for a system made of a one protomer ( or for a single protomer in absence of interaction , @xmath41 ) , according to eq.([eq : cs - glauber ] ) , we define the constants @xmath42 and @xmath43 as the rates for activation and inactivation with @xmath44 , @xmath45 their counterparts for @xmath9 are @xmath46 the rates of binding and unbinding are respectively given by @xmath47 when it is in the activity state @xmath7 .",
    "the ratio between the rate constants @xmath48 is the _ dissociation constant _ of the binding process , @xmath49 : @xmath50 the dynamics of a single isolated protomer is depicted in fig.[fig : cs - single ] . the ratios of the rate constants @xmath51 and @xmath52 are determined by the equilibrium statistics , while their specific values affect the kinetics .",
    "it is worth noticing that the binding / unbinding rates at one protomer only depend on the state of the protomer itself and no other protomer in the ring : this assumption of independent binding is typical of allosteric models .",
    "deriving an exact solution for the conditional probability @xmath53 by directly attacking the kolmogorov equation ( [ eq : cs - glauber - master ] ) is far from being an easy task .",
    "however , as experiments show @xcite , in the flagellar motor regulation mechanism of _",
    "e.coli _ it is possible to identify a hierarchy of widely separated time scales .",
    "this opens up the possibility of operating a reduction of the set of states by gradually _",
    "integrating out_/_decimating _ fast degrees of freedom , operating a _ quasi - stationary _ approximation : the time scale of the slow degrees of freedom is much longer than the time needed for the fast variables to relax to a stationary distribution ; hence , the fast degrees of freedom enter the slow dynamics only through quantities averaged over such stationary distribution ( conditioned to the state of the slow variables ) @xcite . the application of such techniques to the study of the allosteric regulation of the motor of _ e.coli _ will be the subject of the following sections .",
    "the approximation scheme is depicted in fig.[fig : timescales ] .",
    "in the present problem , the fastest degrees of freedom are associated with the spin - activity variables : the ( concerted ) conformational transition between cw and ccw state is much faster than the time scale for binding / unbinding of chey - p , respectively occurring on typical times of @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in the associated glauber dynamics in eq.([eq : cs - glauber ] ) , this can be encoded in the limit @xmath56 .",
    "furthermore , it can be seen that the coarsening dynamics of the spin - activity variables occurs over time scales much shorter than the typical time interval between two successive nucleations of an activity domain , the latter setting the frequency of the switch from cw to ccw and vice versa , while the binding @xmath57 is fixed .",
    "this is due to the strong coupling between the neighbouring protomers , @xmath58 , or equivalently , @xmath59 . in this limit ,",
    "the transition rates away from the fully aligned configurations ( all @xmath14 equal ) are of order @xmath60 , while all other spin transitions are much slower , with typical rate @xmath61 .",
    "the discussion of this latter time - scale separation is the subject matter of this section : it will be shown that the strong coupling limit amounts to considering the conformational spread model effectively equivalent to the monod  wyman  changeux model , on the time scale of the switch . at the time",
    "scales typical of these fast processes , the binding state @xmath57 enters via a _ quenched _ external field term , playing a parametric role in determining the quasi - stationary distribution towards which the activity states relax .",
    "the slow binding dynamics will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the ferromagnetic coupling in the conformational spread model is an essential ingredient which accounts for high sensitivity of the motor to the variation of concentration of chey - p , due to the resulting cooperative response .",
    "the implementation of a large coupling @xmath12 is suggested by the experimental determination of this high sensitivity , quantified by a hill coefficient @xmath62 . as pointed out in @xcite , though",
    ", the estimation of the hill coefficient does not impose severe constraints on the parameters of the model , especially on @xmath12 ; in fact , the numerical simulations performed therein show that the sensitivity depends more strongly on the activation energy of the single protomer ( @xmath63 ) than on the cooperativity .",
    "however , combining the experimental knowledge of the hill coefficient with the information about other quantities , such as the mean locked state time and the mean switch time , ma et al .",
    "@xcite were able to provide a very precise estimation of @xmath12 , which is @xmath64 .",
    "for such value of @xmath12 the formation of domain walls is strongly disfavored . at equilibrium , in fact",
    ", the ratio between the probability of configurations with @xmath65 domains and the probability of a coherent one can be estimated as ( see ref.@xcite ) @xmath66 where the binomial factor counts all possible ways of dividing @xmath0 protomers into @xmath65 domains ; for @xmath67 , the limit @xmath68 corresponds to @xmath69 satisfied by the estimate of @xmath12 performed in @xcite .",
    "the stationary equilibrium configuration , at fixed binding states @xmath57 , is therefore concentrated only on the two states with all the protomers in the same state . from a dynamical point of view",
    ", this means that states with one or several domain walls are just short - lived transients between coherent states : as soon as a domain is nucleated inside a coherent configuration , it either immediately expands to invade the whole ring or is suddenly absorbed , typically much before another nucleation occurs .      to realize the fast `` emptying '' of configurations with several domain walls , it is necessary to analyse the structure of the transition rate matrix @xmath70 , when the limits of the time - scale separation ( @xmath71 ) are concerned .",
    "in the limit @xmath59 , in fact , the non - vanishing entries of the matrix @xmath34 , at frozen binding @xmath57 , are either of order @xmath60 , or of order @xmath37 : the latter rates ( slow ) are defined for transitions consisting in a nucleation of a domain , _",

    "i.e. _ motion and destruction of domain walls , and are denoted by @xmath73 .",
    "we can therefore write @xmath74 , with @xmath75 and @xmath76 where @xmath34 are defined in eq.([eq : cs - glauber ] ) , and @xmath77 indicates that the spin - activity variables in @xmath78 have all the same value .",
    "one notices that the coherent configurations ( all protomers active or inactive ) are the only absorbing states of the fast process , since in such cases the entries of @xmath73 vanish .",
    "the dynamics specified by @xmath73 forbids the creation of pairs of domain walls and only allows translation or absorption of domain walls . as a result ,",
    "the fast dynamics leads to one or the other coherent configuration with a typical rate @xmath79 .",
    "as an explicative example , the case of @xmath80 is depicted in fig.[fig : coarsening ] .     for a system of 4 protomers .",
    "grey boxes correspond to the states ; periodic boundary conditions are understood .",
    "arrows are drawn between two states ( or groups of states ) for which @xmath73 is non vanishing for some @xmath81 .",
    "in particular : reversible transitions are allowed between states with equal number of domain walls ; transitions to states with less domain walls are irreversible . starting from any state",
    ", the dynamics leads to one of the coherent configurations in a time @xmath82 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cs - glauber ] ) and ( [ eq : glauber - fast ] ) ] ; such states are the only two activity states in the mwc allosteric model . ]    on a time scale set by @xmath83 , the nucleation of an activity domain can occur . in the coherent activity configurations ,",
    "the process involving the spin - activity variables has slow rates @xmath72 .",
    "it is then possible to apply the standard techniques of time - scale separation @xcite , eliminating incoherent activity configurations from the dynamics at time scales comparable with @xmath83 or longer .",
    "the net effect of the fast coarsening dynamics is included in an effective way into rates , denoted by @xmath84 , which provide the description of the dynamics at the nucleation time scale : a concerted transition between the two coherent configurations @xmath2",
    "( all protomers inactive , @xmath85 ) and @xmath1 ( all active , @xmath86 ) , besides slow binding processes . in this model , the @xmath0-protomer complex can be in 2 different activity states , each of which present in @xmath87 binding configurations ( 2 for each protomer ) : therefore , the model contains @xmath88 states , and corresponds to the concerted allosteric model of monod , wyman and changeux ( mwc ) @xcite .    the structure of the state diagram of the mwc model with its rates @xmath84 is depicted in fig.[fig : mwcgen ] .     and @xmath89 ( differing only by the occupation of the protomer at the bottom of the ring ) .",
    "the spin - activity variables of the ring of protomers are involved in a fast concerted transition ( solid arrows ) , with rates @xmath84 depending on the occupation @xmath57 in a highly non trivial way .",
    "the transitions between different binding configuration is slow ( dashed arrows ) ; only one of the possible binding / unbinding transitions is explicitly represented , while the others are symbolically indicated by unlabeled arrows . ]    in the appendix , the decimation procedure leading from the conformational spread to the mwc model , in the case of @xmath90 has been worked out exactly . in general , the rate of a concerted switch from the activity state @xmath91 ( or @xmath1 ) to @xmath92 ( or @xmath2 ) is @xmath93 where @xmath94 denotes the state where all the spins but the @xmath95-th are in the state @xmath7 , and @xmath96 is the probability of absorption in the state @xmath97 conditioned to the initial state @xmath94",
    ".    a direct analytic derivation of the rates @xmath84 ( or the probabilities @xmath98 ) for a generic @xmath0-protomer ring can be extremely complicated .",
    "however , in the time - scale separation assumptions , the fast dynamics after the nucleation of an activity domain from a coherent state reaches one of its 2 absorbing states before another nucleation could possibly occur .",
    "this means that a calculation of the effective activity switching rates in the mwc model , does not require to include all the incoherent states , but only those with just two domain walls : the coarsening process can be seen as the expansion or contraction of the domain which has been nucleated .",
    "the nucleated domain can either expand until it invades the whole ring ( complete switch ) , or be `` absorbed '' back ( failed attempts ) .",
    "since the detailed balance is still respected by the rates in the decimated dynamics , all their pairwise ratios are fixed by the equilibrium distribution .",
    "hence , since the equilibrium distribution of the mwc model is known from the hamiltonian ( [ eq : cs - ham ] ) ( where the coupling part is just a constant term ) , it is sufficient to determine only _ one _ effective rate @xmath84 exactly . in the case where @xmath99 for all protomers , one is able to calculate the rate of switching from the @xmath2 to the @xmath1 state , by mapping the coarsening process into a simple birth and death process , the random variable being the size of the domain with active protomers ( see the appendix ) .",

    "since the single protomer has higher ligand affinity ( smaller dissociation constant @xmath111 ) when in the active state than in the inactive one , it is required that @xmath112 . from this last relation",
    "one realizes that the number of protomers sets the _ sensitivity _ of the switch : since @xmath113 , the larger @xmath0 , the larger the r.h.s of the condition given by eq .",

    "we notice that the fast dynamics has two absorbing states , which are the equilibrium configurations in the time - scale separation limit : these states are the coherent configurations , namely those with all the protomers in the same activity state ( all spins aligned ) .    on the slow time scales ( much longer than the coarsening process but much shorter than the binding )",
    ", we can calculate effective rates of passing from one coherent state to the other , given by eq.([eq : eff - mwc ] ) .",
    "these rates are limited by the rate of flipping one spin from the starting coherent configuration : this is the slow process , since such transition costs an energy @xmath169 .",
    "the rates are then affected by the probabilities that , once this flip has occurred , the process reaches the other coherent state and is not absorbed back in the starting coherent state : such probabilities are completely determined by the fast dynamics .",
    "the difficulty in calculating such probability stems from the fact that , for a generic number of protomers @xmath0 , a huge number of paths contributes , with amplitudes strongly dependent on the binding configuration @xmath57 .",
    "the general way of proceeding is presented in refs.@xcite .    in the simple example",
    "where @xmath90 , there are only two paths which give contribution to the concerted transition : the flip of the first spin followed by the flip of the second one , or the flip of the second followed by the flip of the first one .",
    "summing up the rates of these possible channels yields the effective rates of the concerted switch   is understood , but not made explicit in the notation . ] : @xmath170 and @xmath171 by substituting eqs.([eq : glauber - fast ] ) and ( [ eq : glauber - slow ] ) into these expressions , we find @xmath172 and @xmath173 even in this simple case with 2 protomers , the first time - scale separation yields effective rates which depend on the full binding state in a non trivial way , and not only on the sum @xmath100 .",

    "first of all , as we remarked in the main text , because of the time - scale separation , the fast coarsening process does not involve any state but the coherent ( which are the long - living states ) and the ones with only two domain walls .",
    "then , the coarsening is simply a motion of the domain walls , namely an expansion or contraction of the domain which has been nucleated , until one of the coherent states is reached .",
    "the expansion / contraction of this domain can happen by a flip of a spin at its right or left border : if the protomer occupancy @xmath8 is the same for all sites , it is not important at which side of the domain the expansion / contraction occurs",
    ". therefore , we can label the states visited by the coarsening process just by the number of protomers in the , _",
    "e.g. _ , active state ( spin up ) , denoted by @xmath177 : far from the absorbing states @xmath178 and @xmath179 , the rate of increasing or decreasing the number of active protomers is twice the rate of moving a domain wall ; the absorption rates from the state @xmath180 and @xmath181 , are the rates of absorbing the two domain walls .",
    "the process is schematically represented here ,        where the ( reduced ) magnetic field @xmath21 is the value of @xmath182 given by eq.([eq : magfield-2 ] ) specified to @xmath99 , so @xmath183 such ( negative ) value is responsible for the downward alignment of the spin - activity variables , namely favouring the inactive state .",
    "the solid arrows represent the fast rates , while the dashed ones are the slow rates of nucleation of one domain .    in the strong - coupling limit ,",
    "@xmath59 , and all the fast rates are asymptotically equal ; the coarsening dynamics is then formally described by a birth - and - death process with site - independent rates , defined on the integer numbers between @xmath184 and @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ as asymmetric random walk with absorbing boundary conditions .",
    "the probability of being absorbed in the state @xmath0 , starting from the state 1 , is easily calculated to be @xmath185 once multiplied by the slow exit rate from 0 to 1 , this gives the effective rate of switching from the inactive to the active state , in absence of ligands : @xmath186 where @xmath102 is the allosteric constant of the @xmath0-protomers mwc molecule , defined in the main text as @xmath187 .",
    "similarly , for the opposite switch , one has @xmath188 these rates are exact up to a correction of order @xmath189 , which is exponentially small in the coupling @xmath190 ( see sec.[sec : cs ] ) .",
    "we notice that the ratio between these switching rates is the allosteric constant @xmath102 , as expected from the detailed balance condition and from the hamiltonian ( [ eq : cs - ham ] ) .",
