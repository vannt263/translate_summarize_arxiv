    "since @xmath0 , two qubits are a ququart . does this entitle anyone to sell , as a source of ququarts , a source of qubits complemented with the instruction `` use twice '' ?",
    "marketing strategies aside , it seems that an honest answer depends on the users capacity of manipulating quantum information .",
    "if they are able to apply arbitrary operations , including entangling ones , on two consecutive qubits , then this is to them indeed a fully legitimate ququart source .",
    "if on the contrary the users are restricted in practice to act on each particle separately , for instance for lack of a quantum memory , then this source is nothing more for them than a qubit source that is being used twice .",
    "the last decade has seen the rise of device - independent certification : some important properties of quantum devices can be assessed by looking only at the observed input - output statistics .",
    "one among these properties is the hilbert space dimension of the system under study , for which one can obtain a lower bound .",
    "device - independent dimension witnesses ( didw ) _ exist both as prepare - and - measure schemes @xcite and as bell - type schemes @xcite .",
    "remarkably , discussion about the power of fixed dimensional quantum systems in simple cases is still topical  @xcite .",
    "but what dimension does one want to certify ?",
    "arguably not just the dimension of `` whatever is in the box '' ( which is ultimately infinite - dimensional anyway ) , but rather that of the degrees of freedom that one is able to manipulate . in the light of the first paragraph",
    ", we are then led to ask : is it possible for a didw to certify that the dimension of the measured state is at least 4 based on data coming from simply using a qubit system twice ? in this paper , we show that some didw can indeed be `` fooled '' in this sense .",
    "the experimental groups that have put effort in implementing proper higher - dimensional encoding @xcite may not be happy if others could base similar claims on mere sequential procedures .",
    "having brought this issue to the fore , we define _ the dimension irreducible under sequential operations _ , or simply _ irreducible dimension _ , and introduce a witness for irreducible dimension four .",
    "we then show that a pair of ququarts and suitable measurements can violate this witness : if this witness is implemented , one will guarantee that the observed statistics do nt come from sequential measurements on smaller - dimensional systems .",
    "we focus on bipartite scenarios involving two parties , alice and bob .",
    "alice s possible measurements are labeled by @xmath1 , and her outcomes @xmath2 .",
    "bob s measurements are labeled by @xmath3 , and his outcomes @xmath4 .",
    "device - independent statements rely only the family of probability distributions ( the `` _ _ behavior _ _ '' ) @xmath5 .    as the title of the original paper goes ,",
    "the family of inequalities derived by collins , gisin , linden , massar and popescu ( cglmp ) was meant to detect the nonlocality of high - dimensional quantum systems @xcite .",
    "these inequalities , that have two inputs and @xmath6 outputs for both parties ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , are therefore natural candidates for dimension witnessing : indeed , the first example of a didw was based on cglmp@xmath9 @xcite , and semi - device independent witnessing of dimensions up to 20 was reported using the cglmp family @xcite .",
    "the didw character of cglmp@xmath10 was studied more recently : it was found that a violation greater than @xmath11 lower - bounds the dimension of the measured system to entangled ququarts  @xcite .",
    "one of the behaviors that exceeds the latter bound is @xmath12 obtained by taking the maximally entangled state ( mes ) of two ququarts @xmath13 and performing the local projective measurement on the bases @xcite @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "indeed , one would find @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "consider now the following encoding of a ququart into two qubits : @xmath19 if both alice and bob perform this encoding , it is well known that the mes is mapped to the product of two two - qubit mess : @xmath20 , with @xmath21 . but here , also the optimal measurement bases and factor as _ sequential measurements_. for alice s ,",
    "bob s being analog , it reads : @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the eigenstates of @xmath24 .",
    "explicitly , this means that one can produce the behavior @xmath12 by the following sequential strategy :    1 .",
    "the source sends out a pair of maximally entangled qubits .",
    "given @xmath25 , alice measures her qubit in the basis @xmath26 ; given @xmath27 , bob measures his qubit in the basis @xmath28 .",
    "2 .   later , the source sends out a second pair of qubits .",
    "if alice obtained the outcome @xmath29 in her first measurement , she now measures the second qubit in the basis @xmath30 ; if she obtained @xmath31 , in the basis @xmath32 .",
    "bob follows the analog procedure .",
    "in particular , one ends up certifying dimension four on both sides , where only a two - qubit source ( admittedly used twice ) , single qubit local manipulations and classical feed - forward were implemented . in appendix",
    "[ appcglmp3 ] , we show that the qutrit dimension witness based on cglmp@xmath9 @xcite may also be violated using solely two - qubit sources and sequential single - qubit measurements .    hoping to better capture the experimental effort in proper high dimensional quantum experiments rather than sequential procedures ,",
    "we introduce the notion of _ dimension irreducible by sequential operations _ , or simply _ irreducible dimension _ , of a quantum behaviour ; and we provide an example of a didw that certifies irreducible dimension four .",
    "let us define a sequential @xmath6-dimensional model as consisting of :    * @xmath6-dimensional sources ( dimensionality ) , * operations and measurements performed sequentially on each @xmath6-dimensional system , possibly feeding forward the measurement outcomes ( sequentiality ) , and * arbitrary local classical processing and shared randomness .",
    "we then say that a behavior is _ sequential d - dimensional compatible _ if it can be obtained using a sequential @xmath6-dimensional model .",
    "the set of sequential @xmath6-dimensional compatible behaviors can be seen to be the closure - under - wiring of the set of @xmath6-dimensional quantum correlations  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , few explicit sets are known to be closed under wiring , and in general it is not known how to characterize the closure - under - wiring of a given set  @xcite .",
    "the smallest @xmath6 such that the behavior is sequentially @xmath6-compatible , is called the dimension irreducible by sequential operations , or simply the _ irreducible dimension _ of the system .",
    "every behavior that can be simulated with classical resources , including those describing prepare - and - measure schemes , has irreducible dimension 1 .",
    "just as for entanglement or nonlocality , nontrivial irreducible dimension must necessarily involve more than one party .",
    "the behavior @xmath12 has irreducible dimension 2 .    given the previous example , one may fear that any probability distribution can be achieved by combining sufficiently many sequential measurements on low dimensional quantum systems , rendering irreducible dimension witnessing a somewhat trivial exercise also in the quantum case .",
    "fortunately , this is not the case : there exist distributions that lower bound the dimension of the involved devices even when sequential strategies are considered .",
    "a witness for irreducible dimension four must rule out sequential measurements on consecutive qubits and qutrits .",
    "we do not know how to express all of these constraints as a function of the observed probability distributions @xmath33 in simple terms . in order to construct an example",
    ", we notice that an _ entangled measurement _ , one whose eigenvectors are entangled states , can not be sequential , since it can not even be simulated with bidirectional classical communication . besides , the minimal dimension to have entanglement is @xmath34 ( two qubits ) .",
    "thus , certification of such a measurement guarantees that a four - dimensional non - sequential operation is performed .",
    "the possibility of certifying entangled measurements was demonstrated in the entanglement - swapping configuration , i.e.  in a tripartite scenario , either assuming knowledge of the dimensions @xcite or in the fully device - independent setting @xcite . exploiting a recent result on self - testing @xcite , we construct an explicit probability point for a bipartite scenario , such that one of bob s measurements can be certified to be entangled .",
    "our point , denoted @xmath35 , uses four measurements for alice and five measurements for bob , each having four possible outcomes .",
    "the entangled measurement will be @xmath36 .",
    "we need the other measurements to first establish that both alice s and bob s systems are composed of two subsystems in a local separable state , which can not be assumed _ a priori _ in a device - independent setting .",
    "let us first leave @xmath36 aside .",
    "the parties label each of the four - valued input and outcomes @xmath37 as two bits : @xmath38 . if @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the unique probability point that violates maximally the chsh inequality , then the state shared between alice and bob is self - tested to the product @xmath41 of two maximally - entangled two - qubits states @xcite .",
    "thus certifies that there are indeed two subsystems in a separable state , both on alice s side ( denoted @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) and on bob s ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) .",
    "in this situation , if @xmath42 and @xmath43 are found entangled conditioned on the outcome of @xmath36 , then @xmath36 must be an entangled measurement on @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    in order to test entanglement on alice s side",
    ", we need suitable measurements , local on her subsystems  and we have got them already . indeed , it is an important feature of self - testing that not only the state , but also the measurements on the subsystems are self - tested as the optimal measurements for @xmath46 to violate the chsh inequality @xcite .",
    "thus we know that alice s measurements are @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , up to local isometries .",
    "now we have a simple recipe to finish the construction of @xmath51 : for the measurement labelled @xmath36 we choose the bell - state measurement ( bsm ) on @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which prepares @xmath42 and @xmath43 in states that violate chsh maximally for those measurements of alice .",
    "thus we ll have @xmath52 since , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , one must use a different chsh expression for each value of bob s outcome @xmath53 .",
    "all the details are given in appendix [ appbsm ] .",
    "in summary , if one observes @xmath54 defined by and , then the density matrix and measurement operators are acting on @xmath55 with @xmath56 , and the statistics can not be reproduced by sequentially measuring several smaller - dimensional ( qubit or qutrit ) sources .",
    "this setup can only be obtained with irreducible dimension four .",
    "in the previous section , @xmath54 is just one behavior , i.e.  a single point in probability space : as such , it will never be observed exactly . in order to have a _",
    "witness _ of irreducible dimension four , we need to discuss the robustness of this criterion . in other words , we want to guarantee that , if the observed probability point is not too different from @xmath54 , one party is still performing an entangled measurement .",
    "it is clear that there is a large room for robustness in the @xmath57 , i.e.  in the choice of the entangled measurement itself : any behavior that shows a violation of chsh ( not necessarily maximal ) for at least one value of @xmath53 would do .",
    "it is less easy to relax the self - testing part , because one immediately loses the sharp conclusion on the existence of subsystems .",
    "the same issue was present for the tripartite certification @xcite and was solved recently @xcite .",
    "we adapt these methods to the present bipartite case , using again tools from  @xcite .",
    "we consider a thought experiment involving our two parties , and give bob two qubits in a maximally entangled state .",
    "we then use a unitary swap operator to compare the projector corresponding to one eigenvalue of bob s with this maximally entangled state of two qubits .",
    "if this fidelity is larger than 1/2 , we conclude that the measurement is entangled .",
    "concretely , we define the 4-dimensional swap operator @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 is bob s projector corresponding to setting @xmath27 and outcome @xmath53 , and @xmath62 is the sum modulo 2 .",
    "this is a generalization of the partial swap used in  @xcite .",
    "we can then estimate the fidelity between the first projector of bob s fifth measurement @xmath63 and the maximally entangled state of two qubits as @xmath64.\\ ] ] in appendix  [ appfid ] we show that this fidelity is related to the fidelity of an entanglement swapping protocol using measurement @xmath63 to entangle two remote qubits .",
    "it thus detect its entangled nature .    to bound the quantity @xmath65 over all possible quantum realizations which are compatible with some behavior @xmath66 , we constructed an sdp matrix of size @xmath67 corresponding to a relaxation of the navascus - pironio - acn ( npa ) hierarchy @xcite .",
    "we then minimized @xmath65 over all such matrices which are compatible with the chosen quantum statistics .    considering",
    "the behavior produced when applying the measurements leading to the @xmath51 statistics on two werner states , we find a regime where @xmath65 must be greater than 1/2 ( c.f .",
    "appendix [ appsdp ] ) .",
    "the corresponding dual sdp program provides a certificate for this conclusion in the form of a bipartite bell inequality .",
    "this bell inequality is a witness of irreducible dimension .",
    "this conclusion is readily confirmed by computing the minimal fidelity @xmath65 which is compatible with some violation of the inequality @xmath68 ( c.f .",

    "values above @xmath70 , garantee that @xmath71",
    ". the maximal quantum violation of @xmath68 is @xmath72.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in this paper , we pointed out that some device - independent dimension witnesses can be violated with lower dimensional systems and sequential measurements on them .",
    "then we showed that this does not need to be the case : it is possible to construct witnesses that can not be violated in that way . in order to put this discussion on firm ground , we proposed the definition of the irreducible dimension of a quantum system and discussed its properties .",
    "a compact characterisation of the statistics achievable with sequential measurements would be of course very welcomed , but it amounts to characterising the closure - under - wiring of a set of correlations and is therefore likely to be a difficult problem . in absence of this full characterization , we showed one approach to construct witnesses of irreducible dimension , by adapting the certification of entangled measurements to the bipartite scenario .",
    "this naturally raises the question of whether the closure - under - wiring of other correlation sets could also be upper - bounded with a similar technique .",
    "different approaches may also be possible for this ( one that we tried for our set of interest but apparently led elsewhere is described in appendix  [ appe ] ) .    finally , given the presented results , one may wonder whether any conclusion can still be obtained if the condition of sequentiality used here is relaxed ( but keeping the condition that each source , operation and measurement device is @xmath6-dimensional ) .",
    "answering such a question goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , we note that excluding such models would allow one to certify the high - dimensionality of the quantum devices involved , without relying on a fixed underlying tensor structure .    at any rate , from now",
    "onwards , before implementing a didw it will be important to check which irreducible dimension it certifies ( if it comes to worst , by resorting to heuristic numerical optimisation ) .",
    "besides , a similar concern should be raised for non - di witnesses of high - dimensional entanglement .",

    "we will show how the qutrit dimension witness proposed in @xcite can be violated using three pairs of maximally entangled qubits and sequential qubit measurements .",

    "using the standard binary encoding , the maximally entangled qu-8it can be factorised into 3 pairs of maximally entangled qubits : @xmath74 the measurement bases of alice and bob will also factorise such that they can be done sequentially on the three qubits . following the notation in the main text ,",

    "the resultant eight outcome distribution can be coarse grained into a three outcome distribution by grouping the outcomes .",
