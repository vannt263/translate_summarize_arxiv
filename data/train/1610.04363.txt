    "the exchange symmetry in quantum mechanics refers to the invariance of a quantum system when two identical particles exchange positions . for electronic systems in particular",
    ", this symmetry leads to pauli s exclusion principle that makes necessary the use of antisymmetric , or fermionic , wave functions .",
    "however , in the theory of electronic structure , the term `` exchange '' is often used in the narrower context of an effective description that treats the interacting electrons as independent particles , assigning a spin - orbital ( @xmath0 ) to each one of them .",
    "the @xmath1-electron system is represented by a slater determinant ( @xmath2 ) built on the set of spin - orbitals @xmath3 and the electrons do not interact directly with each other but each electron lies in the effective field of the other @xmath4 electrons .",
    "the two principal examples of such effective , independent - particle descriptions are the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation @xcite and the kohn - sham ( ks ) scheme @xcite in density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite . based on the reference state @xmath2 of the model ,",
    "the definition of the exchange energy is given in the context of such an independent - particle theory , @xmath5 = - \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_\\sigma \\int\\int \\ !",
    "d{\\bf r } \\ , d{\\bf r } ' \\ , \\frac { | \\rho_\\phi^\\sigma ( { \\bf r } , { \\bf r } ' ) |^2}{|{\\bf r } - { \\bf r}'| } .\\ ] ] where @xmath6 with @xmath7 is the one - particle reduced density matrix of the reference slater determinant @xmath2 .",
    "hence , the exchange energy is defined differently in hf theory , where @xmath2 is the hf slater determinant @xmath8 , from dft where @xmath2 is the ks slater determinant @xmath9 .",
    "the two different definitions lead naturally to different representations of the exchange term ( local in ks , nonlocal in hf ) in the corresponding single - particle equations .    in hf",
    "the nonlocal fock exchange term acts in a different way on the occupied and on the virtual orbitals and this asymmetry can lead to counterintuitive and unphysical behaviour of the hf orbitals and their energies .",
    "for example , the virtual hf orbitals appear to be repelled by a charge of @xmath1 rather than @xmath4 electrons@xcite , a fact that has led to the interpretation of the virtual orbital energies as ( negative ) electron affinities , in an obvious extension of koopmans theorem @xcite . on the other hand , if we view that a virtual hf orbital represents an excitation of a ground state orbital , then the repulsion of the virtual orbital by a charge of @xmath1 rather than @xmath4 electrons becomes a qualitative error arising from the self - repulsion of the occupied orbital  accommodating the electron before excitation  with the virtual orbital hosting to the electron after excitation .",
    "ref.@xcite discusses a similar case of self - repulsion ( `` ghost - interaction '' ) in ensemble dft for excited states .",
    "the self - repulsion of the virtual orbitals and the asymmetry of the action of the fock operator on occupied and virtual orbitals leads to too high single - particle excitation energies and to poor band - structures with too large band gaps . in metals ,",
    "the density of states of the uniform electron gas is found to vanish at the fermi energy@xcite , predicting wrongly the behaviour of an ideal metal to be almost insulating .",
    "( however , see ref .  @xcite . )",
    "another qualitative error of these spurious self - repulsions is that in unrestricted hf theory there are no unfilled shells , i.e. , the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied orbitals are never degenerate , even in systems with odd number of electrons@xcite .",
    "finally , it seems counterintuitive that all the occupied hf orbitals turn out to have the same asymptotic decay@xcite .",
    "the asymmetry in the hf treatment of occupied and virtual orbitals is well known and there is significant work to correct it , e.g. by making rotations in the hilbert space of virtual orbitals@xcite .",
    "an elegant solution to this problem is to employ a common , local , multiplicative , single - particle exchange potential @xmath10 , that treats all orbitals , occupied and virtual , in a symmetric way . indeed , with the self - interaction - free `` exact exchange ''",
    "( exx ) potential in ks theory ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) single - particle properties , such as ionisation potentials@xcite , electron affinities@xcite , single - particle excitation energies and band structures@xcite are obtained accurately .",
    "we note that the exx potential can not be written explicitly in terms of the electron density , but it must be obtained indirectly from the density , by solving a fredholm integral equation of the first kind , known as the equation for the optimized effective potential ( oep ) method  @xcite . in the terminology of ks theory , when correlation is omitted the exx potential",
    "is also referred to as the exchange optimized effective potential ( xoep ) .    by comparison , in semi - local ks approximations ( such as the local density approximation , lda , and other related approximations )",
    "the cancellation of self - interactions is incomplete making the asymptotic decay of the exchange potential too fast , thus leading to inferior single - particle properties .",
    "in fact , the enforcement of the correct asymptotic behaviour is sufficient to improve considerably the accuracy of single - particle properties in these approximations  @xcite .    given that the exchange energy and exchange potential are not measurable quantities , the question arises about their dependence on the reference state of the effective model .",
    "for example , are there physical limits where this dependence can be expected to be either strong or weak ?",
    "this question will be investigated in the following , after obtaining the local exchange potential ( `` local fock exchange '' , lfx ) corresponding optimally to hf s nonlocal fock exchange term .",
    "the ks system is a virtual system of noninteracting electrons defined to have the same ground state charge density as the interacting system of interest .",
    "the ks system is determined by solving single - particle ( ks ) equations featuring the ks potential , which forces the noninteracting electrons to have the required density .    in dft , the ks potential ( functional derivative w.r.t .",
    "density of the noninteracting kinetic energy functional ) is the sum of the electron - nuclear attraction , @xmath11 , the hartree potential @xmath12 , and the exchange and correlation potential , @xmath13 ; the latter is the functional derivative w.r.t . the density of the exchange and correlation energy .",
    "in particular the xoep is the functional derivative of the exact exchange energy , given by the fock expression ( [ one ] ) in terms of the ks orbitals .    ref .",
    "@xcite gives an alternative ( to dft ) and direct way to obtain ab initio approximations for the ks potential , by minimizing an appropriate energy difference ( @xmath14 $ ] , see the variational principle ( 4 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the formalism in @xcite assumes some knowledge of the interacting ground state @xmath15 . also , we point out that although the theoretical scheme developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is based on wave function theory rather than dft , it still results in the usual ks single - particle equations employing the ( exact or approximate ) ks potential .    in the following , to derive the local potential that best simulates the nonlocal fock exchange term , we follow ref .",
    "@xcite , and use the hf ground state slater determinant @xmath8 in place of the interacting state @xmath15 .",
    "then , we search among all effective hamiltonians @xmath16 characterised by a local potential @xmath17 , @xmath18 for the one ( @xmath19 ) which adopts optimally @xmath8 as its own approximate ground state .",
    "the optimisation is achieved using the rayleigh ritz variational principle and minimising , over all local potentials @xmath20 , the non - negative energy difference , @xmath21 \\ge 0 , \\ { \\rm with } \\",

    "the difference of @xmath26 and the sum of the hartree potential and the electron - nuclear attraction defines the local fock - exchange ( lfx ) potential : @xmath27 compared with the exchange optimised effective potential ( xoep ) case , the functional derivative in ( [ fd ] ) is easier to obtain , as it does not involve the calculation of the orbital shifts@xcite .",
    "the local potential with the hf density was studied in the past but also recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was found that it provides an almost perfect approximation to xoep , avoiding mathematical issues in the implementation of xoep with finite basis sets .",
    "however , from our variational derivation we argue that lfx is actually more than a mere approximation to xoep : both potentials are optimal in rayleigh - ritz energy minimizations where we search for the effective hamiltonian @xmath23 that , either adopts the hf ground state @xmath8 optimally as its own approximate ground state ( lfx ) , or , whose ground state minimizes the hf total energy ( xoep ) . in either case , if the restriction of a local potential were relaxed , the hf hamiltonian would be the minimizing one .",
    "it follows that both the lfx potential and the xoep simulate optimally the nonlocal fock exchange term in the hf single - particle hamiltonian .    in the following",
    "we demonstrate that the xoep and the lfx potential share other characteristic properties associated in the literature with exchange . for example , they both form zero - order terms in separate power series expansions of the ks potential , where the first order corrections vanish  @xcite , as we show below . at the variational derivation of @xmath26 above ,",
    "if in place of @xmath8 we employed a finite - order expansion of the interacting ground state using mller - plesset ( mp ) perturbation theory ( pt ) @xcite , and then at each order performed the same optimisation , we would generate a corresponding mp series expansion for the ks potential . from brillouin",
    "s theorem @xcite , singly excited slater determinants do not couple directly with the hf ground state and so , the density of the mp ground state does not change from zero to first order .",
    "hence , in the mp expansion of the ks potential , the zero - order term is @xmath26 and the first - order correction vanishes .",
    "the same holds true for xoep @xcite in dft pt @xcite : the sum of the xoep , the hartree potential and @xmath28 , form the local potential in the zero - order effective hamiltonian @xmath23 , where , if we switch on electronic repulsion the electronic density will not change to first order .",
    "this result was re - derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , using a general version of the variational principle ( [ vphf ] ) .",
    "probably the most characteristic property of the exchange potential is that it is the functional derivative of the exchange energy ( [ one ] ) and as a consequence xoep satisfies the virial relation for exchange : @xmath29 + \\int dr \\ , \\rho({\\bf r } ) \\ , { \\bf r } \\ !",

    "consider now the perturbation treatment of the @xmath1-electron hf hamiltonian , with zero order @xmath33 ( eq .  [ dyo ] , with @xmath34 ) and perturbation @xmath35 , @xmath36 where by @xmath37 we denote the many - body , nonlocal fock exchange term .",
    "the zero order hamiltonian and the perturbation are composed of one - body operators ( both @xmath38 and @xmath33 have similar slater determinant eigenstates ) and hence the perturbation expansion in powers of @xmath39 is expected to converge fast .",
    "since they share the same ground state density , @xmath33 and @xmath38 can be connected with an adiabatic connection path along @xmath39 , for @xmath40 @xcite . then , following levy and perdew  @xcite we obtain , @xmath41 , to second order in @xmath39 , and consequently _ the lfx potential satisfies the virial relation for exchange _ ( [ ve ] ) _ to second order _ in this rapidly convergent expansion in @xmath39 .",
    "this explains the nearly perfect exchange - virial results in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we conclude that the difference between the xoep and the lfx potential is analogous to the difference in the definitions of the exact exchange energy in wave function theory and in dft .",
    "although the two potentials are mathematically different , they describe the same physics and consequently we expect the results of calculations employing these two potentials to be similar , at least in systems where exchange dominates over correlation ( weakly interacting ) .",
    "we now discuss our practical implementation method to calculate the lfx potential . the variational principle",
