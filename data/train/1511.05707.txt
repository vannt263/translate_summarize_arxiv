    "an important precedent here is alexander - hirschowitz theorem dealing with interpolation together with derivatives .",
    "very recently lower bounds for the dimension @xmath4 of the ambient space of the embedding were further improved by blagojevi , cohen , lck and ziegler for real @xcite and complex @xcite affine spaces .    while over the last 50 years the methods of algebraic topology improved the lower bounds on @xmath4 , still very few examples of efficient @xmath2-regular maps are known .",
