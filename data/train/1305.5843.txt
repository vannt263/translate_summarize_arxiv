    "to show that our approach can accurately probe the mechanical properties of _ e. coli _ and _ b. subtilis _ cells , we applied short pulses of hydrodynamic force to the cells and monitored their response ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "for this , the cells were grown in excess nutrients initially without flow . as the cells formed long , straight filaments , we applied a series of pulse - like flow .",
    "each of these pulses lasted for less than 10 seconds so that the effect of growth is negligible .",
    "2 and supporting video s1 show our typical experimental result .",
    "the cells bent transiently at each pulse , and fully recovered their shape immediately after the applied force was removed .",
    "we can explain the experimental results using the theory of linear elasticity .",
    "in the theory , the long filamentous cell can be considered as a cylindrical beam bending by a hydrodynamic force ( si text ) .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "2b is the comparison between data and theory for the tip position ( thus the degree of cell bending ) of the cell during a representative experiment in fig .",
    "2a . from these experiments",
    ", we extracted a flexural rigidity of @xmath2 n@xmath3m@xmath4 , comparable to the result of @xmath5 n@xmath3m@xmath6 obtained by mechanical manipulation of _",
    "e. coli _ cells using optical traps  @xcite .",
    "assuming a cell wall thickness of @xmath7 nm , this corresponds to a young s modulus of @xmath8 mpa .",
    "it should be noted that the small mismatch between the bacterium s diameter and the width of the end of the channel has to be taken into account , see the si text for further details .",
    "we also show in the si text that the turgor pressure does not contribute to the restoring torque .",
    "similar experiments were performed for _ b. subtilis _ ( see si fig .",
    "5 ) giving a young s modulus of @xmath9 mpa , consistent with past results @xcite .",
    "from these results , we conclude that both _",
    "e. coli _ and _ b. subtilis _ cells respond to fast mechanical perturbations as a linear elastic rod .",
    "the elastic deformation and recovery of the cells to pulse - like forces is consistent with the view that _ e. coli _ and _ b. subtilis _ cells can be considered as elastic cylindrical beams  @xcite . the linear elasticity theory",
    ", however , can not explain the observations that bacteria can also deform plastically  @xcite . for plastic deformations",
    ", we noticed that the cells in refs .",
    "@xcite were grown with geometric constraints for a duration comparable to or longer than their mass - doubling time .",
    "since these geometric constraints may exert forces on the cells , we hypothesized that external forces were transduced to the cell - wall synthesis machinery during growth .",
    "therefore , the force - transduction may cause differential growth , thus deformations , of growing cell walls .    as a first step to testing our hypothesis",
    ", we grew the cells with a constant hydrodynamic flow ( of the growth medium ) .",
    "the filamentous cells grew into a curved shape because of the continuous hydrodynamic forces ( fig .",
    "the curved shape of the cell , however , was not easily distinguishable from elastically deformed cells in fig .  2 . to confirm that the cells deformed plastically , we abruptly switched off the flow when the cells significantly bent",
    ". the cells did not recover their straight shape immediately , i.e. , they deformed plastically ( fig .",
    "3a and supporting video s2 ) .",
    "we repeated the experiments with non - growing filamentous cells , and the cells did not show plastic deformations despite long - term application of forces ( see si fig .",
    "we conclude that plastic deformations require both cell wall synthesis and application of forces for a duration over which substantial cell wall synthesis occurs .          the plastic deformation experiments in fig .",
    "3 unraveled an important feature of bacteria cell walls .",
    "as the external forces were removed , the cells always partially snapped back .",
    "this is clearly seen in the time trace of the cell s tip position ( fig .",
    "the partial snap back suggests that the cell bending in fig .  3 has _ both _ elastic and plastic components . in other words , external forces not only cause elastic bending , but may also lead to differential growth which further bends the cell",
    "the two components may be decoupled by removing the external forces , upon which the elastic component should vanish instantly .    to test our hypothesis",
    ", we developed a quantitative , phenomenological model that incorporates force transduction and growth .",
    "we describe below our model and its comparison with data .",
    "we found the data and theory in good quantitative agreement .",
    "our starting point for understanding the data is the theory of dislocation - mediated growth that we developed recently  @xcite .",
    "the model was inspired by recent experimental observations that , in both gram - positive  @xcite and gram - negative  @xcite bacteria , mreb proteins , associated with cell wall growth , move processively along the cell s circumference ( fig .",
    "processive circumferential insertions resemble the climb of edge dislocations in a two - dimensional crystal @xcite , and thus one can utilize the theory of dislocations well developed in materials science .    in the previous version of the growth model",
    ", we studied the motion of dislocations on a perfect cylinder in the absence of external forces  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the previous version can not account for deformations .",
    "we extended our theory to allow for differential growth by transduction of external stress to dislocations ( growth machinery ) .",
    "in our theory , tensile ( stretching ) stress can have two different effects : ( 1 ) increase the speed of processive motion of dislocations ( fig .",
    "4a ) or ( 2 ) reduce the activation energy for nucleation ( fig .",
    "compressive stress will have the opposite effect .",
    "the forces on the elongation machinery are given by the peach - koehler force  @xcite acting on dislocations : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the levi - civita tensor , @xmath12 is the stress tensor and @xmath13 the burgers vector characterizing the dislocation .    for the cylindrical geometry of the cells in our experiment",
    ", the theory predicts that the @xmath14 component of the stress tensor is the one which couples to the circumferential growth , where @xmath15 is the coordinate along the cell s long axis , see fig .",
    "1 . as the cell grows in the presence of a constant flow , a cell wall of thickness @xmath16 , length @xmath17 ( measured from the channel end to the cell tip ) and radius @xmath18 experiences a mechanical stress that depends on its position in the cell ( fig .",
    "4a ) : _ ( ) = , [ eq : stress ]    where @xmath19 is the azimuthal angle of the cylinder along the circumference ( @xmath20 for the cell front facing the flow , and @xmath21 for the back ) , @xmath22 the force per unit length induced by the flow , @xmath15 the position along the cylinder s axis and @xmath14 the mechanical stress induced by the flow .",
    "the surface directly facing the incoming flow feels a tensile stress ( surface - stretching force ) , whereas the other side feels a compressive stress ( which acts to shorten the distance between adjacent glycan strands ) .",
    "accordingly , the cell walls grow differentially , growing faster on the upstream side of the flow . in our experiments ,",
    "the external hydrodynamic force would increase the peach - kohler force by @xmath23 pn for the cell front ( at the channel end , for @xmath24 @xmath25 m ) , and decrease the force by the same amount on the opposite side .",
    "this force is comparable , for example , to the one generated by rna polymerase  @xcite .",
    "it is also comparable to the force due to the turgor pressure ( @xmath8 pn for _ e. coli _",
    "@xcite ) , and thus we expect the mechanical stress to significantly change the activation energy for enzymatic reactions ( see @xcite , p. 165 ) .",
    "this differential growth leads to a dynamically deformed cell shape . due to the large aspect ratio of the filamentous bacteria in our experiments , a relatively small asymmetry in growth leads to a large angular deflection . in the si text",
    "we show that the angular deflection due to differential growth in a small segment of the cell is given by : = , [ amplify ]    where @xmath26 is the net difference on opposite sides of the cell wall due to the asymmetric growth .",
    "therefore , for a small segment of length @xmath17 the relative asymmetry @xmath27 is  amplified \" by the aspect ratio @xmath28 .",
    "this amplification of differential growth often appears in nature , in a diverse range of systems such as the mechanics of plants and of the human gut  @xcite .",
    "a key result that emerged from our theory is a single dimensionless parameter @xmath29 that quantifies the relative contribution of the elastic and the plastic components of deformation .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 depends only on the intrinsic physical parameters of the cell , independent of the experimental conditions .",
    "we show in the supplementary information that = p r / y h , [ eq : e_v_p]where @xmath30 is the turgor pressure , @xmath18 the cell s radius , @xmath31 the young s modulus , and @xmath16 the thickness of the cell wall . for @xmath32 ,",
    "the elastic effects dominate , and there should be full snapback . for @xmath33 ,",
    "the nature of deformation is plastic , and there would be no snapback .",
    "we find @xmath29 is of order 1 for the measured values for _ e. coli _",
    "( see supplementary table 1 ) ,",
    "i.e. , the snapback should be _",
    "b. subtilis _ also has a similar @xmath29 value because _ b. subtilis _ has a proportionally thicker cell wall and higher turgor pressure ( supplementary table 1 ) .",
    "illustration of the differential growth driven by coupling between mechanical stress and cell wall synthesis .",
    "( a ) tensile ( stretching ) stress increases speed of processive motion of strand elongation machinery .",
    "compressive stress has the opposite effect .",
    "black arrows indicate the trajectories of activated dislocations .",
    "( b ) similarly , tensile stress will lower the activation energy for insertion of a new glycan strand , and compressive stress will increase it .",
    "( c ) asymmetric insertion of dislocations is enhanced by the large aspect ratio of the filamentous bacteria , leading to the large observed angular deflections.,width=8 ]    our predictions can be tested quantitatively by measuring the magnitude of snapback and relating it to @xmath29 .",
    "note that the local curvature is proportional to the local growth asymmetry on the front and back sides of the cell .",
    "we find that the slope of the line connecting the tip and the hinge of the cell is a good measure for the integrated differential growth [ @xmath34 , see fig .",
    "4 ] . with this ,",
    "our theory ( si text ) predicts that for small deflections the angles before and after snapback should be proportional , with a slope depending on @xmath29 : large values of @xmath29 imply a small slope ( since the relative importance of plastic deformations is smaller for larger turgor pressure ) .",
    "5 confirms this prediction .",
    "it shows the snapback events of 33 _ e. coli _ and 33 _ b. subtilis _ cells performed under 8 different experimental conditions . as predicted , data for each species collapse onto a master line regardless of the growth medium , temperature , and stokes force .",
    "the slope of the master line is approximately @xmath35 , consistent with a value of @xmath29 of order unity .      that our prediction is verified by two species of bacteria as evolutionarily distinct as _ e. coli _ and _ b. subtilis",
    "_ indicates that force transduction may have more general biological consequences for growth .",
    "for example , recent studies indicate that mechanical force plays a major role in cell - shape deformation leading to tissue morphogenesis in higher organisms  @xcite .",
    "if mechanical stress regulates the rate of cell wall synthesis , it should play a central role in shape regulation . on a cylinder",
    "the circumferential stress due to turgor pressure is twice as large as the stress along the cell s long axis .",
    "this difference in stresses will provide a natural cue for orienting the growth machinery and coordinating glycan strand insertions . in gram - positive bacteria , the stress regulation will further lead to a constant thickness of the cell wall by a negative feedback mechanism : the mechanical stress is inversely proportional to the thickness of the cell wall , and thinner parts of the cell wall will have larger stresses due to turgor pressure , leading to enhanced local growth .     of the tip before and after the snapback .",
    "error bars are omitted from several series for clarity , but are on the order of those shown .",
    "the snapback angle is approximately proportional to the initial angle of deflection when the angles are small , confirming the prediction of the dislocation - mediated growth theory ( si text ) .",
    "the @xmath361/2 slope shows that the contributions by the two fundamental modes of deformation ( elastic vs. plastic ) are comparable with one another , regardless of the temperatures and growth conditions.[fig : snapback],width=8 ]    note that , throughout the experiments , there were cell - to - cell variations in the bending rates , which was about @xmath37 % of the mean .",
    "this suggests that the variability of elastic constants between different cells might be smaller than what was found in earlier studies  @xcite .",
    "we have developed a simple , novel experimental approach to directly probe the mechanical properties of bacterial cell walls .",
    "our results indicate that the cell - wall growth rate depends on the mechanical stress , where faster growth is obtained for tensile ( stretching ) stress .",
    "this mechanism is likely involved in shape regulation and the maintenance of a stable rod - shaped cell over time .",
    "we found that bending forces cause the cell walls to grow differentially .",
    "the differential growth leads to persisting plastic deformations , whose recovery requires cell wall synthesis .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the elastic deformations by pulse - like forces .",
    "the elastic and plastic deformations represent two fundamental modes of cellular response to external mechanical forces , and can be decoupled experimentally as predicted by our theory .",
    "these effects can be revealed only by applying bending forces , and can not be studied by means which can only change the uniform pressures that have to exist inside and outside the cell walls ( e.g. , osmotic shocks ) : since cell - wall growth is not the bottle - neck for the cell growth rate @xcite , the growth rate is not dictated by the cell - wall synthesis rate .    in the future",
    ", it would be illuminating to study deformation behavior in other types of bacteria such as tip - growers  @xcite .",
    "based on the mechanism described here , unlike _ e. coli _ or _ b. subtilis _",
    ", we expect purely elastic deformations regardless of the duration of applied external forces . at the molecular level , direct observation of the asymmetric growth",
    "would provide critical information for the mechanism of cell wall synthesis .",
    "in particular , any changes in the speed of cell - wall synthesis rate or nucleation rate would be a direct test of our model .",
    "this would be a challenging , but experimentally feasible based on the technology available to us  @xcite .",
    "finally , it would be fascinating to study similar mechanisms in higher organisms .",
    "what is the role of forces in guiding the vast diversity of organism shapes in nature ?",
    "previous works have shown the importance of mechanical forces in controlling the shapes of mammalian cells , where the properties of the extracellular matrix can have a large effect on the shape of the cells  @xcite , their fate in differentiation  @xcite , and tissue morphogenesis  @xcite .",
    "the bacterial model system studied here provides insights into the growth process itself , indicating that coupling of mechanical forces should be taken into account to understand robust morphological regulation of single - cell organisms .",
    "+      to deform growing cells non - invasively by applying a well - defined force , we employed a microfluidic device ,  mother machine , \" previously developed by some of us  @xcite .",
    "this device ensures balanced growth of individual cells for hundreds of generations .",
    "furthermore , by controlling the flow speed in the device , the ambient buffer or the content of growth medium surrounding the cells can be switched within fractions of a second  @xcite .",
    "thus , we can tune the force applied to the growing cell since the force is directly proportional to the speed of the flow and the size of the cell @xcite .",
    "the force which we achieve in this setup far exceeds that attainable with afm and optical tweezers .",
    "also , our technique provides much more control of the applied forces in comparison , for example , with cells confined to microfluidic chambers of fixed or deformable shape .    for the purpose of our experiments , it was beneficial to work with filamentous cells with cell division suppressed .",
    "we grew the cells typically up to 50 @xmath1 m long .",
    "this allowed us to precisely monitor the deformation of the cells in the presence of external mechanical forces .",
    "for the _ e. coli _ experiments , we used strain mg1655 with sula under an inducible promoter ( gift from debu raychaudhuri , see a description of the plasmid pdb192 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and cytoplasmic yfp .",
    "sula inhibits polymerization of ftsz , and upon induction with 1 @xmath38 concentration of iptg the cells became filamentous .",

    "this strain is typically grown in the presence of 0.5% xylose ; filamentation is induced by removing xylose from the growth media .",
    "we used the hydrostatic pressure due to the controlled height difference between the inlet and outlet to control the flow through the device and achieve short ( subsecond ) response times of the flow velocity , as we verified using fluorescent beads . in the si text",

    "<S> for example , bacteria can significantly deform when grown with constraints  @xcite and yet are able to recover their native shape  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the mechanism underlying deformation and recovery , as well as the cues which regulate cell - wall growth , have not been well understood .    </S>",
    "<S> we have developed combined experimental and theoretical methods to directly address how mechanical stresses are involved in regulation of cell wall growth . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental approach is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> rod - shaped _ </S>",
    "<S> eschericia coli _ or _ bacillus subtilis _ cells are inserted into snuggly fitting micro - channels where they are grown in a controlled environment . </S>",
    "<S> filamention is induced in the cells by suppressing division , see the materials and methods section for further details .    </S>",
    "<S> the filamentous cell is subjected to precisely calibrated hydrodynamic forces . </S>",
    "<S> this simple approach has two notable advantages to previous methods : ( 1 ) we can directly probe the mechanical properties and responses of the cell walls _ non - invasively _ for a wide temporal range ( from @xmath0 1 second to over one hour ) ( 2 ) we can achieve force scales several orders of magnitude larger than what is possible by optical traps  @xcite or atomic force microscopy  @xcite . using this approach , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the cells can exhibit two fundamentally different modes of deformations , and recover from them . </S>",
    "<S> the first mode is _ elastic _ in that the cell recovers its shape as soon as the external force is removed . </S>",
    "<S> the other mode is _ plastic _ and requires growth for morphological recovery . </S>",
    "<S> the plastic deformations are due to _ differential growth _ , resulting from a coupling to mechanical stresses varying along the cell walls .    </S>",
    "<S> we also provide a theoretical framework that explains our experimental findings quantitatively . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea is that external forces are transduced to the activity of the cell - wall growth machinery . to explain shape deformations , we calculated the effect of force - transduction by extending the theory of dislocation - mediated growth of bacterial cell walls  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we found that , for pulse - like forces that are transient , the cell walls respond elastically in agreement with  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , if the duration of applied forces is comparable or longer than the timescale of cell - wall growth , the force - transduction causes differential growth of the cell walls and plastic deformations as seen in  @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 m . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section of the micro - channels is square ( approximately 1.2 @xmath1 m x 1.2 @xmath1 m . ) and the cells fit snuggly . </S>",
    "<S> cell division can be blocked by expressing sula proteins that inhibit formation of the ( ftsz ) constriction ring , so that we can induce large deformations and recovery of the cell for a long period . </S>",
    "<S> the cells were grown typically up to 50 @xmath1 m during measurements . </S>",
    "<S> controlled hydrodynamic forces are exerted on the cells by the viscous drag of the growth media ( si text ) . </S>",
