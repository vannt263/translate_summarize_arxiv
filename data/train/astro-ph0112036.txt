    "the doppler spectroscopy technique has been used in recent years to detect low amplitude , periodic radial velocity variations in @xmath260 nearby stars , which have been interpreted as due to planetary mass companions .",
    "this interpretation requires several assumptions , namely that the root cause of the variation is keplerian in nature ; that the companion mass ( m@xmath4 ) is substantially less than the mass of the primary ; and that one is seeing light from a single star as opposed to an unresolved , comparable - mass binary system @xcite .",
    "the quantity determined by the radial velocity observations is then m@xmath4sin(@xmath5 ) where @xmath5 is the unknown inclination of the orbital plane to our line of sight to the star .",
    "the argument usually advanced to suggest that the masses of the companions must be small assumes that the distribution of orbital inclinations is uniform so that , on average , @xmath6m@xmath4@xmath7m@xmath4sin(@xmath8 @xcite , which implies that the true companion mass can not be much greater than the minimum mass , m@xmath4sin(@xmath5 ) . note that this statement is only true for a large sample , and it does not preclude individual companions from having true masses that are significantly larger than their minimum mass .",
    "several pieces of work support the planetary mass interpretation .",
    "for example , @xcite have determined that the dynamical stability of the ups and system constrains the mass of the outer planet to be less than 1.43 times its minimum m@xmath4sin(@xmath5 ) value .",
    "there is also one case , hd209458 , for which the companion has been observed to transit the disk of the central star @xcite , hence giving a measure of both the companion radius and the inclination of its orbit .",
    "the companion mass of @xmath20.6 jupiter masses ( m@xmath3 ) is consistent with that of a giant planet . however , despite the statistical and dynamical arguments , and the special case of hd209458 , doubts have persisted that m@xmath4sin(i ) is nearly equal to m@xmath4  for several reasons .    using a combination of hipparcos and ground - based map ( multichannel astrometric photometer ) astrometry in conjunction with the orbital parameters derived from the radial velocity ( rv ) data ,",
    "@xcite have found that the m@xmath4sin(@xmath5 ) = 1m@xmath3  companion to @xmath9 crb is in a nearly face - on orbit with @xmath5 = 0.5 , and has a true mass of 115m@xmath3 , making it an m dwarf rather than a planetary - mass object . @xcite",
    "have used hipparcos astrometry to show that the m@xmath4sin(@xmath5 ) = 6.4m@xmath3  companion to hd10697 is actually a 38m@xmath3  brown dwarf in an orbit with an inclination of just 5 . a similar analysis combining the hipparcos and radial velocity data extended to the 30 systems with orbital periods in excess of ten days @xcite suggests that at least four of the 30 stars they analyzed have stellar mass companions , that is , m@xmath4@xmath10m@xmath3 , which in turn would require @xmath11 .",
    "if the distribution of inclinations in the sample is uniform , the probability of a system having an inclination @xmath12 is given by @xmath13cos(@xmath14 ) . for @xmath14=1 ,",
    "the probability would be 1.5@xmath15 , making it unlikely that even one such system would be observed in a sample of 2000 stars .",
    "this led han et al . to suggest that there might be a bias toward small inclination angles in the radial velocity studies .",
    "@xcite also finds statistically significant astrometric orbits with low inclinations for three out of four of the han et al .  potential stellar mass companions .",
    "however , @xcite argue that the trend to low inclinations is an artifact of the adopted reduction procedure , and that the astrometric data are not precise enough to allow the conclusion that a significant fraction of the rv companions have stellar masses .",
    "an independent line of evidence also raises the possibility of stellar mass companions for some of the 60 systems . among a subset of 9 of the stars of spectral type f with candidate",
    "planetary companions , suchkov & schultz ( 2001 ) have identified three potential binaries , hd19994 , hd89744 , and hd169830 , along with hd114762 ( private communication ) , based on the fact that they are overly bright for their spectral type and hipparcos distance .",
    "gonzalez et al . ( 2001 ) found that two stars with rv companions , hd37124 and hd46375 , are similarly too luminous for their spectral type and distance ; they might each be unresolved binary systems .",
    "however , they also note that a wide , long - period binary can not be ruled out , so the short period rv companion need not be the source of the  excess \" luminosity .",
    "another line of reasoning suggesting that the rv companions may not be planetary in nature comes from an analysis of the distribution of their eccentricities and orbital periods , which are statistically indistinguishable from those for single - line spectroscopic binaries ( sb1s ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , the apparent correlation of eccentricity with orbital period for the rv companions is similar to that for sb1s @xcite , and their bivariate probability distribution functions are again statistically indistinguishable ( stepinski & black 2001 )",
    ". the observed orbital properties also differ strongly from those of our own planetary system .",
    "the current data , interpreted as planetary systems with random inclinations , also does not lead to a simple theoretical picture ( e.g. , marcy et al .",
    "1999 ) , and there is currently no compelling dynamical argument to support the interpretation that all of the rv companions are planets , rather than brown dwarfs or stars in low inclination orbits . a determination of which companions ( if any ) are not planetary would facilitate the development of a dynamical model .",
    "astrometric observations of the stellar reflex motion induced by a companion can potentially remove the uncertainty in sin(@xmath5 ) , and thus determine the companion mass . the hubble space telescope ( hst ) fine guidance sensor 1r ( fgs1r ) can measure relative stellar positions to an accuracy @xmath20.3milliarcsecond ( hereafter mas ) , a factor of 3 - 5 improvement over that of hipparcos and map data . in this paper we present the results of a pilot program utilizing an observing technique designed to quickly search for perturbations larger than about 0.3mas to the position of @xmath0cnc ( hr3522 , hd75732 , 55cnc ) , a g8v star with an m@xmath4sin(@xmath5 ) = 0.88m@xmath3  companion in an orbit with a period of 14.65 days @xcite .",
    "han et al .",
    "report a preliminary reflex motion with a semi - major axis of 1.15mas for this star .",
    "we discuss our rationale for selecting this target and our observing strategy in section 2 , and our results in section 3 .",
    "detection of companion - induced reflex motion is complicated by the need to determine the typically much larger proper motion ( @xmath16 ) and parallax ( @xmath17 ) of the star , which normally requires observations over a baseline of at least one year . however",
    ", a carefully designed observing strategy can shorten this time dramatically provided an rv system with a relatively short period is chosen , and provided the individual astrometric observations can be made with sufficient precision .",
    "we therefore concentrated on stars from han et al .  with the following characteristics : relatively short period ; a large ( @xmath18mas ) reflex motion inferred to be present with at least moderate statistical significance ; and ones most likely to have companions that are m dwarfs or brown dwarfs ( their groups 2 and 3 ) .",
    "an additional criterion was the suitability of the target for fgs1r astrometry , namely , the availability and distribution of stars in the fgs field of view , needed to define the inertial reference frame . using these criteria , @xmath0cnc was determined to be the most suitable target .",
    "its predicted reflex motion of 1.15mas radius implies that the companion is an m - dwarf of 126m@xmath3  rather than the m@xmath4sin(@xmath5 ) value of 0.88m@xmath3 .",
    "however , the han et al .  result has only borderline statistical significance for this target , and therefore falls into their group 2 , stars for which they expect the majority of the companions to be brown dwarfs .",
    "we realized that we would detect a reflex motion with fgs1r only if the rv companion is more massive than about 40m@xmath3 which , to be consistent with the radial velocity data , implies that the inclination of its orbit would be nearly face on .",
    "( inclinations larger than about 2  imply a companion mass that is too small to produce an astrometric signature large enough to measure with hst . )",
    "our observing strategy was designed to optimize our ability to detect a perturbation with the known 14.65day period and low eccentricity of the companion s orbit , and the unknown value of @xmath19 ( the longitude of the ascending node ) .",
    "we performed a set of fgs1r observations in the one month period centered around the time of maximum parallax factor in right ascension ( ra ) ( hereafter @xmath20 ) on 1 may 2001 .",
    "we observed at pairs of epochs with times that were both phased with the companion s 14.65 day period ( p ) , and symmetric about the time of @xmath20 .",
    "explicitly , observations were executed in pairs occurring at the same phase from april 17 through may 16 .",
    "the relative phases for each epoch are shown in figure 1 .",
    "with additional observations on may 30 ( epoch 10 at @xmath21p ) , we monitored the star s position over more than two full orbits of the companion .",
    "the star s proper motion @xmath22 can then be determined from the epoch pairs without a simultaneous determination of its parallax . since the rate of change of the parallax as projected along declination , @xmath23 , was constant to within 1% at the time of @xmath20 , it simply added to @xmath24 as a constant .",
    "measurable reflex motion would manifest itself as a larger _ dispersion _ in the proper motions of the pairs .",
    "this strategy favors shorter period systems since the reflex motion is then more apparent , i.e. , less diluted by the star s much larger proper motion .",
    "epochs 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 8 each consisted of two hst visits , the other epochs of 1 visit .",
    "the data obtained in epoch 3 were severely degraded due to a loss of lock on guide stars part way through the observing sequence , so the proper motion measurement utilizing data from the epochs 3 ( @xmath25p ) and 7 ( @xmath26p ) temporal pair could not be made .",
    "each visit consisted of one hst orbit .",
    "all observations were obtained at a fixed hst roll angle and pointing , and the observing sequence for each visit consisted of 45 observations of @xmath0cnc interspersed with 14 observations of each of the 7 reference stars .",
    "one of the reference stars , @xmath9cncb , is the proper motion companion to @xmath0cnc .",
    "observations of this star were unsuccessful in the first 6 epochs due to incorrect input coordinates .",
    "in a given hst orbit the relative positions of the stars were determined with a precision of about 1mas , as illustrated by the residuals for @xmath0cnc  shown in figure 2 .",
    "data from multiple epochs were combined by a standard 6 parameter plate solution using the gaussfit program ( jeffereys , fitzpatrick , & mcarthur 1987 ) .",
    "the solution yields the proper motion of @xmath0cnc and @xmath0cncb , and a catalog of star positions in ( @xmath27,@xmath28 ) space , along with residuals to these quantities .",
    "when combining data from visits restricted to the @xmath29 temporal pairs defined above , the parallactic displacement along ra is not an issue since it is common to such data sets .",
    "however , when other visits are included in the analysis , the parallax of @xmath0cnc must be accommodated in the solution .",
    "since it was not possible to solve for the parallax ( because of the short interval over which the observations were made ) , we adopted the hipparcos value of @xmath30mas for @xmath0cnc and @xmath9cncb , while constraining the parallax and proper motion of the remaining reference stars to zero . to determine our sensitivity to the choice of @xmath17",
    ", solutions were done with @xmath31mas .",
    "the residuals in the astrometric catalog produced for each assumed value of @xmath17 were essentially constant , indicating that our particular choice of @xmath17 was not important provided it was correct to within a few percent .",
    "the residuals of the star positions in the derived astrometric catalog were small , 0.270.45mas for @xmath27 , and 0.280.60mas for @xmath28 , ( see figure 2 ) with the exception of those for @xmath9cncb , which were @xmath21 mas , attributable to the fact that it was observed in only 5 of 15 hst orbits .",
    "the derived proper motions for @xmath0cnc and @xmath9cncb were ( @xmath32,@xmath33)= ( @xmath34 and ( @xmath35 mas / yr respectively . the error bars include the cumulative 1-sigma errors from all the fitted parameters .",
    "this compares with the hipparcos values of @xmath36 for @xmath0cnc .",
    "the difference between our proper motion and the hipparcos value is most likely due to unmodeled , but small , proper motion of one or more reference stars , which ca nt be accurately measured over such a short time .",
    "we emphasize that our technique and results do not depend on an accurate determination of the absolute proper motion , but rather on the differential accuracy with which we can determine it among epochs and epoch pairs , so a systematic offset from the hipparcos value is not relevant .",
    "we used three different techniques to search for reflex motion and to gauge the sensitivity of our measurements .",
    "first , we fixed the inclination at @xmath37 and the period of the companion to p=14.65days and solved for the phase and radius of the reflex motion , along with residuals of these values , using data from all 10 epochs .",
    "this solution yielded a reflex motion with a radius of @xmath38mas , i.e. , a non - detection .",
    "second , we again fixed the inclination and period of the companion , then in simulations imposed a range of values for the phase angle and radius of the reflex motion on the data , and solved for the phase and radius ( again using data from all 10 epochs ) to assess how accurately we could recover them if such perturbations were present .",
    "the recovered values of ( @xmath39,@xmath40 ) matched the imposed values to within the residuals computed by the model for @xmath41mas .",
    "from this test we concluded that our observations would have detected any 14.65day period circular reflex motion with a radius in excess of 0.3mas at 1.5@xmath42 .",
    "no such motion was seen in the real data .",
    "our final and most sensitive test for detecting the reflex is to look for dispersions in the proper motions computed from the @xmath29 temporal pairs taken at epochs with identical parallax factor @xmath43 .",
    "the proper motion computed from epochs ( 1,9 ) and ( 3,7 ) , each pair taken at the same star / companion orbital phase , should agree and be the real proper motion . unfortunately , as mentioned earlier , the astrometry obtained in epoch 3 were compromised , so only the data from epochs ( 1,9 ) could be used to measure a ",
    "reflex - free \" proper motion .",
    "table 1 (  measured \" ) shows the values of ( @xmath16 ) computed from the three remaining @xmath29 temporal pairs .",
    "as expected , the average value of ( @xmath16)=(516,251)mas / yr derived from the pairs is very close to that derived using the data from all 10 epochs .",
    "however , the dispersion of @xmath24 is nearly a factor of three larger than that of @xmath22 , due primarily to the ( 1,9 ) pair , which we attribute in part to the fact that the epoch 1 and 9 observations consisted of only a single hst orbit , while the epoch 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 observations consisted of two hst oribts each .",
    "note that the change of the star s position due to its orbit around the star - companion barycenter has a position angle which is 180@xmath44 different in epochs ( 2,8 ) relative to that in epochs ( 4,6 ) ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "therefore any astrometric signature of the star s companion would manifest itself most dramatically in the the proper motions computed from these epoch pairs .",
    "the data from epochs ( 4,6 ) take on particular significance because they span the shortest time interval among the temporal pairs , hence any detectable reflex motion is least diluted by the star s true proper motion computed from this pair .    to illustrate this",
    ", we conducted a series of simulations whereby we again impressed upon the data a circular reflex motion with a 14.65 day period , along with semi - major axes of 0.3 , 0.5 and 1.0mas , and a variety of phase angles .",
    "the results of these simulations are shown in table 1 . as expected ,",
    "because it is the  reflex free \" pair , the epochs ( 1,9 ) proper motion shows no change due to the imposed perturbation , while the ( 4,6 ) pair has changed significantly , even for the smallest 0.3mas perturbation . in these simulations ,",
    "a reflex motion is absorbed into the proper motion computed from each @xmath29 temporal pair .",
    "therefore , the greater the reflex , the larger the _ dispersion _ in the values of ( @xmath45 ) , even though the perturbation has little effect on the average value of the proper motion computed from all the temporal pairs . for example , the measured dispersion in ( @xmath45 ) is ( 5,14 ) , while that from the simulation with ( @xmath46)=(0.3mas,103 ) is ( 18,15 ) and that from ( @xmath46)=(0.3mas,13 ) is ( 5,25 ) .",
    "we take the _ ratio _ between the standard deviation of the measured proper motion and the perturbed proper motion as a rough ( and very conservative ) estimate of our ability to detect a real perturbation to the proper motion .",
    "the standard deviations in table 1 are computed in the conventional fashion , i.e. , as the square root of @xmath47 divided by @xmath48 using the three epoch pair values listed in the table for the three cases presented . for",
    "the 0.3 , 0.5 and 1.0mas perturbations these ratios ( average for the two phases presented in table 1 ) are 3 , 4 , and 7 .",
    "comparison of the measurements and simulations for only the ( 2,8 ) and ( 4,6 ) pairs would in fact be a more valid ( and less conservative ) measure of the sensitivity because the ( 1,9 ) pair is unaffected by the perturbation , and would give an even larger ratio .",
    "we therefore conclude that a reflex motion of 0.3mas is conservatively ruled out at about the 3@xmath42 level , and any reflex motion with a semi - major axis in excess of 0.5mas is firmly ruled out at greater than 4@xmath42 .    in summary ,",
    "the strategy we chose for attempting to astrometrically detect and measure a reflex motion of @xmath0cnc with hst / fgs1r yielded the anticipated sensitivity . with just 14 orbits of hst time over a 30 day interval we were able to conclusively rule out the preliminary 1.15mas perturbation proposed by han et al .",
    "furthermore , we ruled out at the 3@xmath42 level a perturbation with an amplitude greater than about 0.3mas .",
    "this places an upper limit of @xmath230m@xmath3  on the mass of @xmath0cnc s companion , implying that it is a sub - stellar object .",
    "we emphasize that this observing technique is fully capable of detecting the larger and more statistically significant astrometric perturbations for , e.g. , @xmath9crb and hd195019 found by han et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and pourbaix ( 2001 ) if they are real .",
