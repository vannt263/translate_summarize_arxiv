    "close - in exoplanets , as for mercury , venus and the majority of the natural satellites in the solar system , are supposed to undergo significant tidal interactions , resulting that their spins and orbits are slowly modified .",
    "the ultimate stage for tidal evolution is the synchronization of the spin and the circularization of the orbit ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the spin evolves in a shorter time - scale than the orbit , so long - term studies on the tidal evolution of exoplanets usually assume that their rotation is synchronously locked , and therefore limit the evolution to the orbits .",
    "however , these two kinds of evolution can not be dissociated because the total angular momentum must be conserved .",
    "synchronous rotation can only occur when the eccentricity is very close to zero .",
    "otherwise , the rotation rate tends to be locked with the orbital speed at the periapsis , because tidal effects are stronger when the two bodies are closer to each other .",
    "in addition , in presence of a companion body , the eccentricity undergoes oscillations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and the rotation rate of the planet shows variations that follow the eccentricity @xcite . as a consequence , some unexpected behaviors can be observed , such as a secular increase of the eccentricity . in this letter",
    "we provide a simple averaged model for the orbital and spin evolution of an exoplanet with a companion ( sect.2 ) , and apply it to the hd117618 planetary system ( sect.3 ) .",
    "we then give an explanation for the eccentricity pumping ( sect.4 ) , and derive some conclusions ( sect.5 ) .",
    "we consider here a system consisting of a central star of mass @xmath0 , an inner planet of mass @xmath1 , and an outer companion of mass @xmath2 .",
    "we use jacobi canonical coordinates , with @xmath3 being the position of @xmath1 relative to @xmath0 , and @xmath4 the position of @xmath5 relative to the center of mass of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we further assume that @xmath8 , that the system is coplanar , and that the obliquity of the planet is zero .",
    "the inner planet is considered an oblate ellipsoid with gravity field coefficients given by @xmath9 , rotating about the axis of maximal inertia , with rotation rate @xmath10 , such that ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) j_2 = k_2  .",
    "@xmath11 is the gravitational constant , @xmath12 is the radius of the planet , and @xmath13 is the second love number for potential .",
    "since we are interested in the secular behavior of the system , we average the motion equations over the mean anomalies of both orbits .",
    "the averaged potential , quadrupole - level for the spin ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , octopole - level for the orbits , and with general relativity corrections ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is given by :    @xmath14    where c_0 =  , c_1 =  , c_2 =  , c_3 =  .",
    "@xmath15 is the semi - major axis ( that can also be expressed using the mean motion @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 is the eccentricity , and @xmath18 is the difference between the longitudes of the periastron , @xmath19 .",
    "we also have @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "the contributions to the orbits are easily obtained using the lagrange planetary equations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : e_=  , _ = -  .",

    "can thus be reduced to one degree of freedom .    in our model , we additionally consider tidal dissipation raised by the central star on the inner planet .",
    "the dissipation of the mechanical energy of tides in the planet s interior is responsible for a time delay @xmath28 between the initial perturbation and the maximal deformation . as the rheology of planets",
    "is badly known , the exact dependence of @xmath28 on the tidal frequency is unknown .",
    "several models exist ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but for simplicity we adopt here a model with constant @xmath28 , which can be made linear @xcite .",

    "we neglect the effect of tides over the longitude of the periastron , as well as the flatenning of the central star .",
    "their effect is only to add a small supplementary frequency to @xmath35 , similar to the contributions from the general relativity ( for a complete model see * ? ? ?",
    "under the effect of tides alone , the equilibrium rotation rate , obtained when @xmath36 , is attained for ( eq.[090515a ] ) : = f(e _ ) = = 1 + 6 e_^2 + o(e_^4 )  .",
    "usually @xmath37 , so tidal effects modify the rotation rate much faster than the orbit . it is thus tempting to replace the equilibrium rotation in expressions ( [ 090515b ] ) and ( [ 090515c ] ) . with this simplification ,",
    "one obtains always negative contributions for @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xcite , = - 7 k_ f_6(e _ ) e_^2  , e_= - k_ f_6(e _ ) ( 1-e_^2 ) e _  , with @xmath40 thus , the semi - major axis and the eccentricity can only decrease until the orbit of the planet becomes circular ( fig.[fig1]a ) .",
    "however , planet - planet interactions can produce eccentricity oscillations with a period shorter , or comparable to the damping timescale of the spin . in that case , the expression ( [ 090520a ] ) is not satisfied and multi - planetary systems may show non - intuitive eccentricity evolutions , such as eccentricity pumping of the inner orbit ( @xmath41 increases while @xmath25 decreases ) .",
    "as an illustration of the eccentricity pumping , we apply our model to the hd117618 system .",
    "this sun - like star ( @xmath42 ) has been reported to host a single saturn - like planet on a eccentric orbit @xcite .",
    "the residuals of the best fitted solution to the observational data are 5.5 m/s , so we assume that any additional companion with a doppler shift semi - amplitude smaller than this value is presently undetected , that is , any planet with @xmath43 and @xmath44au .    in our simulations",
    "we adopt for the observed planet the same geophysical parameters as for saturn , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and a dissipation time lag @xmath48s ( which is equivalent to @xmath49 ) .",
    "since the semi - major axis of the planet undergoes tidal dissipation , its value was certainly larger when the system formed .",
    "we then adopt @xmath50au as initial value for all simulations .",
    "the initial eccentricity is chosen such that @xmath51 when @xmath52 , the present observed values ( tab.[table1 ] ) .",

    "the observed eccentricity would be around 0.1 , and we still needed to explain the high initial value near 0.7 .",
    "we now add a companion to the system with @xmath60 , @xmath61au , and @xmath62 , and set @xmath63 . at first",
    ", we only consider dissipation in the spin ( eq.[090515a ] ) and neglect its effect on the orbit ( eqs.[090515b],[090515c ] ) , in order to highlight the eccentricity pumping ( fig.[fig1]b ) .",
    "we then clearly observe this effect , the eccentricity of the inner planet rising up to 0.7 .",
    "we also observe that the eccentricity of the outer planet is simultaneously damped , because of the conservation of the total angular momentum ( eq.[110819b ] ) .",
    "orbital and spin evolution can not be dissociated , so we then integrate the full system ( fig.[fig1]c ) .",
    "we observe that the initial behavior of the system is identical to the situation without dissipation on the orbit ( fig.[fig1]b ) .",
    "however , as the eccentricity increases , the inner planet comes closer to the star at periastron , and tidal effects on the orbit become stronger . as a consequence , the semi - major axis decreases and the damping effect on the eccentricity ( eq.[090515c ] ) overrides the pumping drift .",
    "the system ultimately evolves into a circular orbit .",
    "the present configuration is attained around 4gyr of evolution , which is compatible with the present estimated age of the star .",
    "the pumping effect is then responsible for a delay in the final evolution of planetary systems and may explain the high values observed for some of them ( tab.[table1 ] ) .",
    "finally , we repeat the integration of the full system , but with a smaller - mass companion @xmath64 at @xmath65au .",
    "the companion eccentricity is still @xmath62 , but the inner planet now begins with @xmath66 ( fig.[fig1]d ) .",
    "the initial evolution is still similar to the previous simulation ( fig.[fig1]c ) , except that the eccentricity oscillations of both planets are higher , because the orbits are closer . since the companion mass is smaller , its eccentricity also decreases more than before , and reaches zero around 3gyr . at this stage , the angle @xmath67 stops circulating , and begins librating around @xmath68 .",
    "the two orbits are then tightly coupled and evolve together , showing an identical behavior to close - in planets with a few days of orbital period ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a consequence , the evolution time - scale is much longer , allowing the inner planet to maintain high eccentricity for longer periods of time ( fig.[fig1]d ) .",
    "the present eccentricity is only observed after 6gyr .    1truecm",
    "in order to understand the unexpected behavior of the eccentricity during the initial stages of the evolution , we can perform some simplifications in the equations of motion without loss of generality ( sect.2 ) .",
    "we can neglect tidal effects on orbital quantities ( eqs.[090515b],[090515c ] ) , which is justified since @xmath69 ( eq.[090514 m ] ) .",
    "the only contribution of tides is then on the rotation rate ( eq.[090515a ] ) . the semi - major axis and the mean motion are thus constant , and the eccentricity only varies due to the gravitational perturbations ( eq.[110816h ] ) . in addition , we linearize the set of equations of motion in the vicinity of the averaged values of @xmath70 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the solution of ( [ 090520a ] ) , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 . in the following , @xmath75",
    "is expressed as a function of @xmath76 and @xmath77 using the conservation of the angular momentum ( eq.[110819b ] ) .",
    "then , the set of equations of motion ( [ 110816h ] , [ 110819a ] , [ 090515a ] ) reduces to : e_= - a  , = g + g_x x + g_e e _  , x = -_x x + _ e e _  , with a = _ 31  , @xmath78 g_x = _ 1  , @xmath79 _ x = k_f_1(e_0 )  , _ e = -k _ ( f_1 ( e_0 ) x_0 - f_2(e_0 ) )  , where @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "we neglected the octupole terms since @xmath82 , the contributions from @xmath83 , and assumed that @xmath84 .    at first order ,",
    "the precession of the periastron is constant @xmath85 , and the eccentricity is simply given from expression ( [ 110812b ] ) as e_= ( g t + _ 0 )  , where @xmath86 .",
    "that is , the eccentricity @xmath24 presents periodic variations around an equilibrium value @xmath87 , with amplitude @xmath88 and frequency @xmath89 . since @xmath90 ,",
    "the above solution for the eccentricity can be adopted as the zeroth order solution of the system of equations ( [ 110812b]@xmath59[110812d ] ) . with this approximation ,",
    "the equation of motion of @xmath76 ( [ 110812d ] ) becomes that of a driven harmonic oscillator whose the steady state solution is x = ( g t + _ 0 - )  , with @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "the rotation rate thus presents an oscillation identical to the eccentricity ( eq.[110812e ] ) , but with smaller amplitude and delayed by an angle @xmath93 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "using the above expression in equation ( [ 110812c ] ) and integrating , gives for the periastron : = g t + _ 0 + ( g t + _ 0 - ) + ( g t + _ 0 )  .",
    "finally , substituting in expression ( [ 110812b ] ) and using the approximation @xmath94 gives @xmath95 or , combining the two products of periodic functions , @xmath96 the two middle terms in the above equation can be neglected since they are periodic and have a very small amplitude ( @xmath97 ) . however , the last term in @xmath98 is constant and it adds a small drift to the eccentricity , = t  .",
    "the drift is maximized for @xmath99 , it vanishes for weak dissipation ( @xmath100 ) , but also for strong dissipation ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "note that the phase lag @xmath93 between the eccentricity ( eq.[110812e ] ) and the rotation variations ( eq.[110920a ] ) is essential to get a drift on the eccentricity .",
    "that is why the eccentricity pumping was never observed in previous studies that did not take into account the spin evolution .",
    "the major difference when we consider the full non - linearized problem is that the drift ( eq.[110902b ] ) can not grow indefinitely .",
    "indeed , when the eccentricity reaches high values , the drift vanishes ( fig.[fig1]b ) . moreover , tidal effects are also enhanced for high eccentricities and counterbalance the drift ( eq.[090515c ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the drift on the eccentricity is never permanent , although it can last for the age of the system ( fig.[fig1]c , d ) .    in order to observe the pumping effect ,",
    "the eccentricity should not be damped , while the damping timescale of the spin of the planet should be of the order of the period of eccentricity oscillation .",
    "this is valid for gaseous planets roughly within @xmath102 .",
    "about half of the planets in this range present eccentricities higher than 0.3 ( tab.[table1 ] ) .",
    "this is somehow unexpected , since the time - scale for damping the eccentricity ( @xmath103 ) is shorter than the age of those systems ( tab.[table1 ] , fig.[fig1]a ) .",
    "thus , unless the initial eccentricity of those planets was extremely high , one may suspect of the existence of undetected companions that help the eccentricity to maintain the present values .",
    "in this letter we have shown that , under some particular initial conditions , orbital and spin evolution can not be dissociated .",
    "indeed , counterintuitive behaviors can be observed , such as the secular augmentation of the eccentricity .",
    "this effect can last over long time - scales and may explain the high eccentricities observed for moderate close - in planets .",
    "the variations in the flattening of the inner planet due to rotation ( eq.[101220a ] ) is a key element to pump the eccentricity by means of @xmath104 ( eq.[110902b ] ) .",
    "we have considered an instantaneous response to the rotation in @xmath9 , but a time delay until the maximum deformation is reached is to be expected .",
    "this may increase the phase lag between the eccentricity forcing ( eq.[110812e ] ) and the precession angle oscillations ( eq.[110812 g ] ) .",
    "it results that the drift effect on the eccentricity can be even more pronounced than the one presented here ."
