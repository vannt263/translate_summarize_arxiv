    "the discovery of high curie temperatures ( @xmath6 ) in some diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms)@xcite has created a renewed interest in the study of the properties of these materials due to their potential role in spintronics devices if above room temperature @xmath6 s are achieved.@xcite    when a iii - v compound is magnetically doped the added holes can gain kinetic energy by moving in the bands formed by the hybridized orbitals or magnetic energy by interacting with the spin of the localized magnetic impurities .",
    "the kinetic term induces delocalization and it is usually studied in momentum space ; the magnetic term tends to localize the carriers and it is natural to study it in real space . in the limit of large mn doping",
    "the kinetic term should prevail while in the very diluted regime the magnetic term has to be accurately considered .",
    "most studies of dms are based in one of these two extreme limits .",
    "however , in order to understand the intermediate region between both extremes powerful non - perturbative techniques are needed .",
    "the goal of this work is to provide such a tool .",
    "the band structure of zinc - blende type semiconductors has been accurately obtained using a variety of different approaches such as pseudopotential methods , tight - binding techniques , and by careful consideration of the symmetries involved through the application of group theory.@xcite however , many of these calculations involve a large number of orbitals per site making them unsuitable for simulations of doped systems with present day computers .",
    "the successful luttinger - kohn model,@xcite that describes the top of the valence band of semiconductors with diamond structure is very useful to study hole doping in cases of strong hybridization . when the doped holes are not localized they go into the valence band and a formulation of the problem in momentum space is appropriate .",
    "this approach , known as the valence band or hole - fluid scenario , has already been applied to dms@xcite providing results that would be valid in a regime in which the doped holes are uniformly distributed in the crystal and the randomness in the impurity distribution becomes irrelevant . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that in the limit of strong dilution the doped holes will have a tendency to become localized at the mn impurities . in this",
    "extreme regime holes move by hopping through overlapping orbitals and this behavior is better described in real space .",
    "the study of this limit has been carried out only at a phenomenological level using tight binding hamiltonians that , while taking into account the random position of the impurities , do not provide a realistic band description of the bands resulting from the overlaps of the atomic orbitals involved.@xcite    the goal of this paper is to provide a realistic , yet simple , tight - binding - like hamiltonian , in real space , that reproduces the top of the valence band of zinc - blende type semiconductors with the smallest possible number of degrees of freedom per site , and that handles the interactions between the doped holes and the randomly distributed magnetic impurities . it will be shown that six orbitals per site are needed to capture experimental properties of the dms even in the case of a strong spin - orbit ( so ) interaction in which , naively , only four orbitals are relevant at the top of the valence band.@xcite this model reproduces the curie temperatures observed experimentally for various values of mn doping and compensations and it captures the curie - weiss behavior of the magnetization curves in the low compensation regime .",
    "it also predicts that for mn doped gaas the curie temperature would pass through a maximum value @xmath7 for @xmath8 suggesting that higher mn doping is not the route to achieve room temperature @xmath6 with gaas .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the general tight binding approach is described in section ii ; section iii is devoted to systems in which the spin - orbit interaction can be neglected ; the spin - orbit interaction is considered in section iv by working in a basis formed by total angular momentum eigenstates @xmath9 ; section v is devoted to the discussion of coulomb interactions and how to handle the possibility of mn@xmath0 doping .",
    "numerical results in finite systems for a variety of materials are presented in various subsections of section vi ; conclusions and a summary appear in section vii . in the appendix",
    "the change of basis matrices are provided .",
    "although we will provide a hamiltonian that can be applied to any iii - v semiconductor with zinc - blende type structure , we will use mn doped gaas as our example . in gaas ,",
    "the ga and as atoms bond covalently .",
    "both atoms share the electrons that they have in their 4s and 4p shells .",
    "ga shares 3 electrons while as shares 5 .",
    "the hybridized orbitals have character @xmath10 .",
    "although the @xmath11 and @xmath12 orbitals have to be considered in order to obtain the correct band structure , we are interested in light hole doping for which we will focus only on the valence band , since to facilitate numerical simulations we need to minimize the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "it is well known that around the @xmath2 point the valence band of gaas has @xmath13 character , which arises from the original @xmath12 orbitals.@xcite thus , in order to construct the simplest model that captures this feature we will consider only the @xmath12 orbitals .",
    "the three @xmath12 orbitals @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 in each ion can be populated with particles with spin up or down .    to study gaas",
    "we should consider two interpenetrating fcc lattices separated by a distance @xmath17 were @xmath18 is the underlying cubic lattice parameter .",
    "the ga ions seat in one of the fcc lattices and the as ions in the other .",
    "each ion has 4 nearest neighbors of the opposite species located at @xmath17 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "since we are only interested in obtaining the valence band we are going to consider the bonding combinations of the ga and as @xmath12 orbitals.@xcite this leads to an effective fcc lattice with three @xmath12 bonding orbitals at each site that can be occupied by particles with spin up or down .",
    "thus , working in this @xmath22 basis there are 6 states per site of the fcc lattice .",
    "we will consider the nearest neighbor hopping of these particles to construct the effective tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "the twelve nearest neighbors are located at @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 considering the four sign combinations for the three sets of points provided .    in order to calculate the hoppings we follow slater and",
    "koster.@xcite the nearest neighbors in our effective fcc lattice are the second nearest neighbors in the original diamond structure . from table",
    "we see that the relevant overlap integrals in this case are @xmath26 @xmath27,\\ ] ] and @xmath28 .",

    "( we are following slater s notation ) , it follows that @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are equal to 0 or @xmath36 .",
    "then the hoppings to the twelve neighbors that we will label by @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 taking the values @xmath40 , @xmath41,and @xmath42 , are :    @xmath43= -t_{xx}^{\\parallel } , \\eqno(2a)\\ ] ] if either @xmath44 or @xmath45 or @xmath46 if neither @xmath39 nor @xmath38 are equal to @xmath47 , and @xmath48 = \\mp t_{xy } , \\eqno(2c)\\ ] ] with the minus ( plus ) sign for the case in which @xmath38 and @xmath39 have the same ( opposite ) sign . also notice that the interorbital hopping is only possible when @xmath37 and ab are in the same plane , i.e. , there is no perpendicular interorbital hopping .",
    "if the doped mn ions go into the parent compound as mn@xmath1 replacing ga@xmath0 , it means that a hole is doped into the @xmath12 hybridized orbitals which form the valence band of the undoped semiconductor .",
    "this allows us to write a hamiltonian that takes into account the nearest neighbor hopping of the holes in the @xmath12 orbitals using the hoppings calculated above , and their magnetic interaction with the localized randomly doped mn@xmath1 ions : @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 creates a hole at site @xmath52 in orbital @xmath47 with spin projection @xmath53 , @xmath54=@xmath55 is the spin of the mobile hole , the pauli matrices are denoted by @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the localized mn@xmath1 spin @xmath58 at site @xmath59 ( covering only a small fraction of the total number of sites @xmath60 since mn replaces a small number of ga ) .",
    "@xmath61 are the hopping amplitudes for the holes that were defined in section ii , and @xmath62 is an antiferromagnetic ( af ) coupling between the spins of the mobile and localized degrees of freedom.@xcite the density @xmath63 of itinerant holes is controlled by a chemical potential .",
    "the sites * i * belong to an fcc lattice and the versors @xmath64 indicate the 12 nearest neighbors of each site * i * by taking the values @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , with @xmath68 .",
    "notice that we have only three different hoppings : two intraorbital ones @xmath69 and @xmath70 and the interorbital ones @xmath71 . all have the same absolute value ( but not always the same sign ) for all combination of orbitals and neighbors . the interorbital hoppings that have the sign reversed are the ones towards sites labeled by @xmath38 and @xmath39 with opposite signs , i.e. @xmath72 . also notice that the interorbital hoppings occur only in the planes defined by the two orbitals , i.e. , they vanish in the direction perpendicular to the plane were the two orbitals are @xmath73 .",
    "this can be seen in the expressions provided in eq.(1 ) .    in order to obtain the material specific values of the hopping parameters we will write the hamiltonian matrix in momentum space for the undoped case , i.e. , eq.(3 ) with @xmath74 .",
    "we can use table ii or iii in ref . to do this task .",
    "the result is given by , @xmath75 for spin up and an identical block for spin down .",
    "here @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 with @xmath80 , @xmath81 , where in slater s notation @xmath82 , with @xmath18 the zinc - blende lattice constant and @xmath83 are the momentum components along @xmath84 , or @xmath85 .",
    "we mentioned in the introduction that luttinger and kohn studied the movement of holes in the valence band of semiconductors with the diamond structure .",
    "working in momentum space they found an expression for the hamiltonian matrix that describes the top of the valence band , i.e. , the neighborhood of the @xmath2 point . in the @xmath22 basis",
    "the matrix has the form :    @xmath86    there is an identical block for spin down .",
    "@xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are constants that can be defined in terms of the luttinger parameters @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 ( ) which are material specific . the accepted values for gaas are @xmath93.@xcite the constants are given by : @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 where @xmath34 is the mass of the bare electron .",
    "remembering that eq.(5 ) is an approximation valid for the top of the valence band ( i.e. the @xmath2 point ) , we can expand the cosines and sines in eq.(4 ) and we obtain the matrix shown in eq.(5 ) if we disregard a constant term along the diagonal that just shifts the top of the valence band to @xmath97 instead of 0 . comparing the coefficients",
    "we obtain expressions for the hoppings in terms of the luttinger parameters and the lattice constant @xmath98:@xcite @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 since our goal is to write a tight - binding hamiltonian for holes that will dope at most the bottom of the band , we will reverse the signs of the hoppings since the band obtained in eq.(5 ) gets reflected with respect to zero by reversing the signs of @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89.@xcite then , for gaas , @xmath102 , @xcite and from eq.(7 ) we obtain : @xmath103    it is important to notice that the evaluation of the hopping parameters given by eq.(7 ) requires three independent parameters to fix their values . however , if we look at the expression for the hoppings given in eq.(2 ) in terms of overlap integrals it would appear incorrectly as if only two parameters were necessary and the three hoppings should be interrelated .",
    "the evaluation eq.(7 ) is more accurate though because it considers , in a phenomenological way , the influence of the neglected bands in the shape of the valence band at @xmath2 .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction is important in gaas and in other iii - v semiconductors in which the ion v has a large mass .",
    "it mixes the angular momentum ( @xmath104 for the @xmath12 orbitals ) with the holes spin degrees of freedom producing states with @xmath13 and @xmath105 . in a cubic lattice with the diamond symmetry , luttinger and",
    "kohn showed that at the @xmath2 point the states with @xmath105 get separated from those with @xmath13 which are the relevant states at the top of the valence band . as a result ,",
    "naively only four states per site , instead of six , become relevant when the spin - orbit interaction is considered and the doping is light.@xcite however , as it will be shown in section vi , at the levels of doping of interest ( @xmath106% ) the heavy and light hole states that become populated are sufficiently separated from the @xmath2 point that the @xmath107 contribution becomes important .    to take into account the spin - orbit interaction",
    "we will have to perform a change of basis from @xmath22 to @xmath9 .",
    "this change of basis has been studied by kohn and luttinger.@xcite    the luttinger - kohn matrix ( eq.5 ) in the @xmath9 basis is presented in eq.(a8 ) of ref ..",
    "the six states that form the basis are : @xmath108 applying the same change of basis to @xmath109 with @xmath110 given in eq.(4 ) we obtain the @xmath111 matrix @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the change of basis matrix provided in appendix i.    @xmath114    with @xmath115 @xmath116 @xmath117 @xmath118 @xmath119 @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the spin - orbit splitting which is tabulated for different materials.@xcite the matrix in eq.(10 ) agrees with eq.a8 in ref . in the limit of small @xmath122 .",
    "now we need to calculate the hoppings in real space between the 6 orbitals characterized by @xmath13 and @xmath123 and @xmath124 and @xmath105 with @xmath125 .",
    "to do this , we need to express the @xmath126 operators that appear in eq.(3 ) in terms of the @xmath126 operators in the basis @xmath9 with the help of the basis transformation given in the appendix :    @xmath127    and @xmath128    we obtain : @xmath129 @xmath130 @xmath131 and @xmath132 @xmath133 @xmath134 replacing in eq.(3 ) and rearranging the terms we find that the intraorbital hoppings are given by :    @xmath135 @xmath136 @xmath137    @xmath138    now let us consider the inter - orbital hoppings between orbitals with @xmath139 :    @xmath140 @xmath141 @xmath142 and @xmath143 where @xmath144 in the above expressions .",

    "in this section we will consider , at a phenomenological level , the effects of mn doping that go beyond the mere introduction of a localized spin at the doping site @xmath216 and the addition of holes into the system .",
    "up to this point we have implicitly assumed that the mn @xmath217 levels are deep into the valence band of the parent compound so that when a mn ion replaces ga in gaas , ga@xmath0 is replaced by mn@xmath1 and a hole is introduced in the @xmath12 orbitals . in this case , negative charge with respect to the background at the mn site creates an attractive coulomb potential for the hole which , in the case of one single mn ion , contributes to producing a bound state at 0.1ev above the top of the valence band.@xcite this bound state is expected to generate an impurity band at least for very light amounts of doping .",
    "this impurity band , due to hybridization , eventually will merge with the valence band as the amount of doping increases . for gaas",
    "it is believed that the merging occurs for @xmath218@xcite and for this reason the coulomb interaction is not expected to play a role in the relevant doping regime .",
    "however , the explicit addition of a coulomb term to the hamiltonian is important in order to reproduce the gaas behavior at very low dopings and , in materials for which the hole binding energy is larger , such as gap and gan.@xcite thus , below , in subsection a , we are going to describe how to introduce coulomb attraction in our model .",

    "the coulomb potential between the localized impurities and the doped holes is neglected in most models for dms@xcite since the magnetic interaction appears to be sufficient to capture qualitatively many properties of these materials including ferromagnetism , and because it is believed that at the levels of doping for which the material is metallic it will not play a relevant role.@xcite however , these assumptions need to be confirmed by actual calculations .",
    "very few attempts to include the coulomb interaction studying its effects with unbiased approaches have been carried out .",
    "the case of a single mn impurity in gaas was studied in ref .. they considered the long range coulomb potential suplemented by a central cell correction with a square - well shape that is routinely applied in calculations of bound state energies for impurities in semiconductors.@xcite this is the portion of the potential that is expected to be relevant at higher doping since the long - range part will be screened .",
    "this effect has been incorporated by many authors@xcite by considering an on - site central - cell potential of the form : @xmath219 the value of @xmath220 varies widely in the literature .",
    "many authors determine it by finding the value that added to @xmath156 reproduces the energy of the single hole bound state.@xcite however , the value of @xmath220 depends strongly on the characteristic of the model used such as the total bandwidth , the number of orbitals , etc . in other investigations",

    "it was proposed that a nearest - neighbor range potential should be used , and mc calculations performed on a highly doped single orbital model showed that an impurity band generated by the on - site potential vanished when a nearest - neighbor range potential of the same strength was used . in the fcc lattice considered here , the extended potential has the form @xmath221 where @xmath220 is added at the site i in which the impurity is located and at its 12 nearest neighbors i+@xmath222 .",

    "calculations using both eq.(32 ) and ( 33 ) will be presented in section vi.e .",
    "the phenomenology described in the previous subsection is expected to occur when the mn @xmath217 orbitals lie deep into the valence band so that mn@xmath1 replaces the iii@xmath0 ion and the doped hole goes into the @xmath12 orbitals . however ,",
    "if the mn @xmath217 levels were in the parent compound s gap , the iii@xmath0 ion could be replaced by mn@xmath0 with the hole in its @xmath224 shell .",

    "thus , we will follow a more phenomenological approach by introducing only one extra orbital , which will add two extra degrees of freedom per mn due to the spin of the hole .",
    "for this purpose , we extend the six orbital model described by eq.(31 ) by adding an extra orbital at the impurity sites that can be populated by holes with spin up or down . to simplify the calculations we will consider an extra s - like orbital .",

    "@xcite this approximation would certainly simplify numerical simulations since the number of degrees of freedom per lattice site is reduced from six to four .",

    "the band dispersions under the four - orbital approximation ( continuous line ) agrees with the dispersions for the six - orbital case ( dashed line ) only in a very small region about @xmath2 with radius @xmath276 while the study of many representative dopings such as @xmath277 with @xmath278 involves states at a radius @xmath279 .",

    "@xmath281 , and @xmath282 directions the heavy - hole dispersion is well reproduced for a large momentum range but the very close in energy light - hole state is not captured by the 4 orbital approximation .",
    "even worse , along the @xmath283 direction , the flatness characteristic of the heavy - hole band is missed in the 4 orbital approach .",
    "thus , the 4 orbital model would only be adequate to describe very lightly doped cases ( probably in the insulating regime ) beyond the reach of finite lattice simulations and not very relevant for the high @xmath6 regime .",
    "0.3 cm    an example of the shortcomings of the 4 orbital model is the incorrect form of the magnetization m as a function of temperature ( t ) that it provides . in fig.5a the magnetization curve for @xmath277 mn",
    "doped gaas calculated with the 4-orbital approximation ( circles ) is compared with the one given by eq.(31 ) ( diamonds ) .",
    "the curie - weiss ( cw ) shape observed in experiments@xcite is only captured by the 6-orbital model@xcite while the 4-orbital approximation reproduces the concave shape observed in previous numerical efforts dealing mostly with single orbital models.@xcite in addition , the value of @xmath6 is underestimated in this approach .",
    "as pointed out in the previous subsection , a problem of early unbiased numerical efforts was the failure to reproduce the curie - weiss shape of the magnetization curves obtained in experiments of mn doped gaas with low compensation . while this shape was characteristic of most mean - field based approaches@xcite , a concavity consistent with percolative behavior was observed otherwise.@xcite    according to our results the cw behavior is very sensitive to the dispersion curves and the number of orbitals .",
    "numerical simulations of the model presented here have shown that the spin - orbit interaction is crucial to obtain the cw shape of the magnetization curves.@xcite in fig.5a we present magnetization curves obtained in lattices with 256 ga ions for @xmath284 , @xmath277 , and the hole density @xmath278 .",
    "the curve with @xmath285 , indicated with diamonds , is in excellent agreement with the experimental data for mn doped gaas exhibiting cw behavior .",

    "the luttinger parameters are @xmath298@xcite and we use @xmath299ev . in this case we obtain a magnetization curve with an almost linear temperature dependence ( squares in fig.5b ) . this linear behavior has been obtained in measurements of ( ga , mn)p with @xmath300@xcite but it is not clear whether it will continue up to 8.5% doping if this value were reached .    for completeness , we also present the results for ( ga , mn)n .",
    "a @xmath301k , well above room temperature , is obtained in this case .",
    "this result is in agreement with mean - field predictions , assuming the doped mn in the state mn@xmath1,@xcite and with some experimental measurements.@xcite the effects of mn-@xmath217-level participation will be discussed in subsection e.      many studies of dms are based on reasonable assumptions on the properties of the ground state .",
    "some researchers work in the `` high doping '' regime assuming that the doped holes are uniformly distributed in the system and effectively doped into the valence band of the material .",
    "this is the so - called valence - band scenario@xcite in which the disorder configurations of the mn ion are disregarded .",
    "the other approach , known as the impurity - band regime,@xcite considers the limit of very low doping in which the holes electrically bound to the impurity cores start forming an impurity band due to the overlap of the wave functions . in this case",
    "the disordered positions of the mn ions would play an important role .",
    "although each scenario must be valid in opposite doping regimes , it is not clear when the crossover between the two occurs ( since it is a function of @xmath5 , @xmath156 , and other parameters ) and which one better describes the experiments is controversial . even for ( ga , mn)as both descriptions are applied to the case of @xmath5=8.5% .",
    "a way of shedding light on this issue is by studying the evolution as a function of @xmath156 , and for different values of @xmath5 , of the four degenerate states at the top of the valence band ( @xmath2 point ) of the parent compound .",
    "this splitting is due to the interaction of the doped holes with the localized spins and it was briefly described when the classical limit was discussed in section iv.a . for small values of @xmath156 , at values of @xmath5 in the metallic regime according to mott s criterion , it is expected that the mean - field approach ( assuming uniform hole distribution ) should be a good approximation .",
    "the calculations indicate@xcite that the levels will split following a linear behavior in @xmath302 , i.e. , @xmath303 and @xmath304 with @xmath177 given in eq.(23 ) and ( 24 ) .    we have evaluated the eigenvalue distribution for different mn disorder configurations ( indicated with different symbols in fig.6 ) as a function of @xmath156 for @xmath5=8.5% ( fig.6a ) and 5% ( fig.6b ) . for both values of @xmath5 it can be seen that the mean - field prediction is accurate for @xmath305ev ; for @xmath156=1.2ev , i.e. , the accepted value for gaas , the eigenvalues have lower energies than the mean - field ones indicating a stronger distortion of the bands due to the interactions",
    ". however , the eigenvalues appear to be independent of the disorder configurations indicating that the holes are non - localized ; this uniform hole distribution continues up to @xmath306ev which is the value at which our numerical simulations indicate that an impurity band starts to develop in the density of states.@xcite for larger values of @xmath156 there is a large spread in the eigenvalue distribution as a function of the disorder .",
    "notice that the effects of disorder are much stronger for @xmath5=5% than for @xmath5=8.5% which corroborates the assumption that the role of disorder diminishes as @xmath5 increases .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , in disagreement with the mean - field expectation that the spread in the eigenvalue distribution should increase with @xmath5 , we actually observe that as @xmath5 increases the width of the eigenvalues band decreases .     for ( a ) @xmath179 and ( b ) for @xmath180 in a 256 sites lattice .",

    "<S> we present a hamiltonian in real space which is well suited to study numerically the behavior of holes introduced in iii - v semiconductors by mn doping when the iii@xmath0 ion is replaced by mn@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the actual lattice with the diamond structure . </S>",
    "<S> since the focus is on light doping by acceptors , a bonding combination of iii and v p - orbitals is considered since the top of the valence band , located at the @xmath2 point , has p character in these materials . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> an effective model in which the holes hop between the sites of an fcc lattice is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> we show that around the @xmath2 point in momentum space the hamiltonian for the undoped case is identical to the one for the luttinger - kohn model . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbit interaction is included as well as the on - site interaction between the spin of the magnetic impurity and the spin of the doped holes . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of coulomb interactions between mn@xmath1 and holes , as well as mn@xmath0 doping are discussed . through large - scale monte carlo simulations on a cray xt3 supercomputer , </S>",
    "<S> we show that this model reproduces many experimental results for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and that the curie temperature does not increase monotonically with @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the cases of mn doped gap and gan , in which mn@xmath0 is believed to play a role , are also studied . </S>"
