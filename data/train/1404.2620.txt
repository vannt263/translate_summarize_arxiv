    "spiral arm structures are the beautiful structures that have fascinated astronomers for a long time .",
    "one of the long - time mysteries of the spiral arm was the so - called `` winding - dilemma '' . from the observations of the rotation curve of disc galaxies",
    ", it is known that the stars in the inner region of the disc rotate faster , i.e. the angular speed is higher , than the stars in the outer region .",
    "therefore , if the spiral arm is a material arm , i.e. the spiral arm is moving at the same speed as the stars , the spiral arm should wind up quickly ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "spiral density wave theory described in @xcite solved the issue by considering the spiral pattern as a density wave .",
    "then , the density wave can be a rigidly rotating feature with a constant pattern speed , irrespective of the stellar rotation speed , and consequently long - lived .",
    "recently , thanks to the powerful computational facilities , the resolution of three - dimensional n - body simulations has improved significantly , and the artificial heating from which the previous low - resolution simulations suffered is minimized ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such high - resolution simulations allow us to study further the spiral arm theory .",
    "however , even with such high - resolution simulations , so far no single n - body simulation reproduces a long - standing spiral arm feature such as that is suggested in @xcite @xcite .",
    "recent studies show that the spiral arms in the numerical simulations are transient and recurrent ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite demonstrated that the spiral arm was rotating with the same speed as the stars , i.e. co - rotating ( see also * ? ? ? * ) , and therefore winding .",
    "still in each snapshot , the spiral arms are always apparent , and the spiral arms are constantly forming and disrupting , i.e. recurrent , with a lifetime of about 100 myr . although the co - rotating spiral arm leads to the winding - dilemma , @xcite demonstrated that the spiral arms were disrupted before they wound up completely , and the pitch angle of the spiral arms correlated with the shear rate of the disc , as observed ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "interestingly , the winding nature of the spiral arm seen in n - body simulations can naturally explain the observed scatter in the correlation between the pitch angle and the shear rate ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more thorough discussion ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the spiral arms in n - body simulations were forming with a similar mechanism to the so - called swing amplification theory suggested by @xcite and @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , while the swing amplification is considered to happen at a single co - rotation radius , where the spiral arm pattern speed is consistent with the rotation speed of the stars , in the numerical simulations the co - rotation resonance occurs at all radii , and the swing amplification is happening ( or propagating ) at every radius .",
    "this is one of the current explanations for the transient and winding spiral arm features . in others , for example",
    ", the transient features of the spiral arm can be interpreted as overlapping multiple - wave modes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where each mode appears around the co - rotation radius and is relatively long lived . still , there is no clear explanation of the origin and nature of the spiral arms , which remains as a challenge for the galactic astronomer .",
    "interestingly , there is also observational evidence against long - lived spiral arms .",
    "for example , @xcite analysed the pattern speed of the spiral arm as a function of radius for ngc 1068 using their generalized version of the method from @xcite , so - called tremane - weinberg method .",
    "they showed that the pattern speed of the spiral arm decreases with radius , and therefore the lifetime of the spiral arm must be short .",
    "similar pattern speeds were also observed with the same technique in other galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the accuracy and validity of the tremaine - weinberg method are still needed to be tested against the future observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another observational test is the so - called `` offset '' method .",
    "if there is a long - lived rigidly rotating spiral arm , one can define the co - rotation radius .",
    "since the angular velocity of gas and stars is observed to be faster in the inner region , the gas and stars in the region inside ( outside ) the co - rotation radius will move faster ( slower ) than the spiral arm .",
    "the gas component piles up in the spiral arms , experiencing a shock that induces star formation @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the youngest stars born from the molecular clouds in the spiral arms would be found slightly ahead of the arm traced by the molecular gas , if located within the co - rotation radius , and behind the arm outside of the co - rotation radius .",
    "therefore , if we observe the tracers of the different stages of star formation , such as hi , co and h@xmath4 , an offset among them as a function of radius would be expected .",
    "by combining h@xmath4 imaging and @xmath5 near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) data , @xcite distinguished the regions with ongoing star formation and the regions with star formation a few hundred million years ago in the grand - design spiral galaxy , m100 .",
    "contrary to the expectation from the density - wave theory , no offset was found between these two regions .",
    "the same conclusion was reached in @xcite , although some studies claimed to find a significant offset for some galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the milky way is a ( barred ) spiral galaxy ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which we can observe in great detail .",
    "for example , the detailed map of hi and co observations provide the global position and kinematics of the spiral arm in the gaseous phase ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "star clusters provide us with reasonable photometric distances , and young star clusters can be used to trace the spiral arm and also measure the pattern speed of the spiral arm using a similar technique to the offset method mentioned above ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the influence of the spiral arms on the stellar motion has also been measured and compared with the models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the maser sources associated with high - mass star forming regions are recognized as a unique source to trace the spiral arm structures , because very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations allow their parallaxes and proper motions to be measured with great accuracy , @xmath6 @xmath7as .",
    "for example , recently the bar and spiral structure legacy ( bessel ) survey and japanese vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ) provided the parallaxes and proper motion measurements for over 100 maser sources @xcite .",
    "in the future , the european space agency s _ gaia _ satellite ( launched in december 2013 ) will produce accurate measurements of the parallax and proper motion for about a half billion disc stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "to study the nature of the spiral arms from these observations , we need to compare the observational data with the theoretical prediction from different scenarios of the origins of spiral arms .",
    "although there are many successful studies for reconstructing the galactic bar structure and the pattern speed by comparing the observational data with the theoretical model prediction , it is more complicated for the spiral arms ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "@xcite assumed the rigid rotation of the spiral arm , and made predictions of the radial velocity distribution of stars in the cases of different number of arms , pitch angles and pattern speed .",
    "@xcite studied how the rigidly - rotating spiral structures affect the stellar kinematics and the distribution of radial and rotational velocities of the stars ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite studied the vertex deviation map from both rigidly - rotating spiral arms and transient spiral arms .",
    "@xcite discussed the origin of the large peculiar velocities observed for the maser sources at that time @xcite .",
    "they argued that such large peculiar velocities are difficult to be explained with the density wave theory , but using n - body / smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations , they showed that the observed large peculiar velocities of the maser sources can be reproduced by the transient and recurrent spiral arms .",
    "therefore , more predictions for the observable signatures from the transient and recurrent spiral arms in the numerical simulations should be valuable for future and on - going observational surveys .    in this paper , we study the kinematic structure of both the star and gas components around a spiral arm in a simulated barred galaxy similar in size to the milky way .",
    "the simulated galaxy has a transient , recurrent and co - rotating spiral arm similar to that seen in @xcite .",
    "we target a spiral arm similar to the perseus arm .",
    "we then make a prediction of the observational signatures of the kinematics of the stars and gas around the perseus arm , if it is also a transient , recurrent and co - rotating spiral arm .",

    "* ) . however , the effect of the assumed static dark matter halo is expected to be small for transient spiral arms which we focus on in this paper . furthermore , a live dark matter halo is often modeled with particles more massive than disc particles , which may introduce some scattering and heating ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , in the interest of computational speed and a more controlled experiment , we use a static dark matter halo .",

    "the colours of the dots indicate the angular momentum change of the star particles during the @xmath55 myr evolution from the time step that we focus on . the short time window of @xmath5640  myr is chosen to highlight the angular momentum change at the snapshot .",
    "the stars in the trailing ( leading ) side of the spiral arm tend to gain ( lose ) angular momentum .",
    "this trend is much clearer in the edge of the arm , compared to around the centre of the arm where there are stars gaining ( losing ) angular momentum at the slightly leading ( trailing ) side of the spiral arm .",
    "@xcite showed that the angular momentum loss and gain was due to the tangential force from the spiral arm , and the stars at the leading ( trailing ) side lost ( gained ) angular momentum at each time .",
    "the tangential force is highest at the edge of the spiral arm , and changes the sign at the centre of the spiral arm . as a results , the radial migration due to the spiral arm is more effective at the edge of the spiral arm than around the centre of the spiral arm .",
    "also note that , the position of the stars in fig .  [ disvrot - fig ] is at the snapshot we chose , but the angular momentum gain and loss is measured within the time bin of @xmath5640  myr .",
    "stars around the centre of the spiral arm can easily move to the other side of the spiral arm within 40 myr , which blurs the trend of the loss and gain of angular momentum with respect to the side of the spiral arm .",
    "radial migration ( change of the angular momentum ) is happening at all radii , because the spiral arm is co - rotating with the stars , which is consistent with @xcite .",
    "a large range of rotation velocities are seen around the spiral arm .",
    "[ vrothis - fig ] compares the distribution of the rotation velocity in the trailing side and the leading side , where we selected the star particles in the distance range between 1 and 2 kpc away from the location of the spiral arm ( the solid line in fig .",
    "[ snap - fig ] ) at each line of sight . as shown in @xcite , in general , stars in the trailing ( leading ) side rotate slower ( faster ) , because they tend to be apo - centre ( peri - centre ) phase .",
    "still , there are some stars which rotate very fast ( slow ) , but are in the trailing ( leading ) side of the spiral arm . especially in the leading side , the rotation velocity distribution shows ( at least ) two peaks .",
    "although one of the peaks is faster than the peak of the rotation distribution in the trailing side and close to the circular velocity , the other peak is slower than the peak in the trailing side .",
    "the slowly rotating stars in the leading side are also visible in fig .",
    "[ disvrot - fig ] .",
    "following @xcite , we identified stars with v@xmath57165 km  s@xmath14 in the leading side ( d@xmath588 kpc ) at @xmath59 deg and tracked their evolution .",
    "they were located at an inner radius very close to the arm , but slightly in the trailing side , when the spiral arm was forming .",
    "they were at the peri - centre phase then , and were accelerated by the spiral arm formation .",
    "consequently , they overshoot the spiral arm , and at the time of the snapshot they are at the apo - centre phase and are decelerated by the arm , which leads to their slow rotation .",
    "we also tracked the stars rotating faster than 250 km  s@xmath14 in the trailing side ( d@xmath583 kpc ) of the arm at @xmath59 deg .",
    "they were rotating at a larger radius before the spiral arm formed .",
    "they were slightly in the leading side of the arm , when the spiral arm starts forming .",
    "then , they were passed by the spiral arm , i.e. moved from the leading side to the trailing side , just before the time step selected .",
    "they are close to the peri - centre phase at the selected time step .",
    "these particles will pass the spiral arm , i.e. they will move from the trailing side to the leading side , after this time step .",
    "therefore , the particles are orbiting around the spiral arm .",
    "the particles that have this type of the orbit are called `` non - migrators '' in @xcite .",
    "the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ disvrot - fig ] show the rotation velocity of the gas component as a function of distance from the observer in the same line - of - slight as the upper panels . because the gas component does not have the epicyclic motion which leads to the variation in the rotation velocities for stars",

    "( as seen in fig .",
    "[ snap - fig ] at @xmath59 deg , there is a bubble induced by sne , which disturbs the kinematics of the gas component . )",
    "we consider this to be the result of the radial migration of the gas .",
    "for example , the gas in the trailing side gains angular momentum and moves to larger radii .",
    "because the spiral arm is trailing , if the migrating gas is accelerated up to the same speed as the gas at the new radius , it will pass the centre of the arm .",
    "to stay in the trailing side at the new outer radius , it should be accelerated to a slightly slower rotation velocity than that of the spiral arm .",
    "the opposite is required in the leading side , and only the gas rotating faster can stay in the leading side of the arm .",
    "these velocity features in stars and gas are due to the co - rotation of the spiral arm .",
    "these features are seen at different galactic longitude samples , because the spiral arm is co - rotating at all of the radial range on which we focus .",
    "these features , therefore , would be good observable indicators to examine if the milky way spiral arms are co - rotating arms .",
    "recently , @xcite published their parallax and proper motion measurements for over 100 of the maser sources .",
    "we converted their proper motion to the rotation velocity , assuming that the sun s rotation velocity with respect to the circular velocity is @xmath61 km s@xmath14 and the galactocentric distance of the sun is @xmath62  kpc @xcite .",
    "we also scaled the rotation velocity to adjust from the measured circular velocity at the solar radius of @xmath63  km  s@xmath14 @xcite to the circular velocity of the simulated galaxy , @xmath43  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "then , we compare the rotation velocity of the maser sources with the gas component of the simulation in fig .",
    "[ snap - fig ] .",
    "interestingly , the rotation velocity of the maser sources ( indicated with open stars ) show a similar variation in the rotation velocity to our gas components . in the middle panel of @xmath60 deg sample ,",
    "the maser sources show slower ( faster ) rotation velocity in the trailing ( leading ) side , which is consistent with the prediction of the simulation which has a co - rotating spiral arm .",
    "unfortunately , there are insufficient maser sources to test against the simulated co - rotating spiral arm at different radii .",

    "this clear sign of the radial migration is observed at different @xmath65 and therefore different radii , because of the co - rotating nature of the simulated spiral arm .",

    "these high @xmath2 stars are induced by the co - rotation resonance of the spiral arm in our simulation , and this could be another observational signature of the co - rotating spiral arm .",
    "however , @xcite demonstrated that the heliocentric radial velocity distribution at @xmath3 deg and the other apogee fields can be described well with an axisymmetric model , i.e. the width of the velocity distribution can be explained purely by the velocity dispersion .",

    "[ disvrot - fig ] and [ vrothis - fig ] , we expect that the velocity distribution would be different between the leading and trailing side of the spiral arm .",
    "therefore , to extract the effect of the spiral arm , the distance information would be crucial .",
    "taking into account stellar populations and the dust extinction may allow meaningful constraints on the distance of the observed stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and help to identify the location of the resonances by examining the apogee data at the different galactic longitudes .",
    "we observed our n - body / sph simulation of a milky way - sized disc galaxy in a similar way to how we can observe the milky way , with particular interest in the stellar and gas motion around the spiral arm .",
    "as our first study , we have focused on the three lines of sight on the disc plane , @xmath0 and ( 150,0 ) deg , and analysed the rotation and radial velocity of stars and gas as a function of the distance from our assumed location of the observer .",
    "similarly to the recent literature based on n - body simulations , our simulated galaxy shows a co - rotating spiral arm , i.e. the spiral arm is rotating with the same speed as the circular velocity , at the lines of sight selected .",
    "we show that the stars around the spiral arm show a large variation in both radial and rotational velocities owing to the co - rotating spiral arm .",
    "if the spiral arm is indeed a co - rotating spiral arm , we should observe a similar variation of the rotation and radial velocities around the spiral arm at every galactocentric radius .",
    "an accurate measurement of the distance , proper motion and radial velocity of the stars is required , and the _ gaia _ data will be a critical test for the co - rotating spiral arm .",
    "we show that the stars behind the spiral arm always gain angular momentum , while the stars at the front of the spiral arm lose angular momentum .",
    "the stars tend to rotate slower ( faster ) behind ( at the front of ) the spiral arm and move outward ( inward ) . because of the epicycle motion of the stars",
    ", we also see the stars with high ( low ) rotation velocity behind ( at the front of ) the spiral arms .",
    "we find that these stars came from the outer ( inner ) region and decelerated ( accelerated ) at the front of ( behind ) the arm .",
    "then , they are passed by ( passed ) the spiral arm and are observed at their peri - centre ( apo - centre ) phase .",
    "these are consistent with @xcite , and indicate a variety of orbits owing to the co - rotating spiral arm .",
    "these variety of orbits are likely to be closely related to the formation and disruption of the spiral arm .",
    "however , we need further investigation to reach a firm conclusion . still , this study indicates that numerical simulations provides useful tests in the study of the nature of spiral arms .",
    "we have also analysed the rotation and radial velocity of the cold gas component .",
    "this is much simpler than the stars .",
    "we found a clear trend in the gas component which rotates slower ( faster ) and moves outward ( inward ) behind ( at the front of ) the spiral arm .",
    "we have compared the results with the observed data of the maser sources from @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the data show similar trend in @xmath71 around the expected position of the spiral arm around @xmath1 deg .",
    "more data from the accurate astrometric measurement of the maser sources will provide additional constraints on the nature of the spiral arm .    although we have observed three lines of sight for one snapshot of the numerical simulation , the observed gas and stellar motions are naturally expected features from our previous studies @xcite , and therefore the observed trend should be common features in the co - rotating spiral arms in n - body / sph simulations .",
    "we have analyzed several snapshots at different timesteps of the simulation , and confirmed that similar kinematic trends are always observed .",
    "encouraged by the success of this study , we are currently working to make a quantitative prediction for the upcoming _ gaia _ data for the co - rotating spiral arm , by taking into account the stellar population , dust extinction and expected _ gaia _ errors by improving the methods in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the entire topic will be further illuminated by another set of theoretical models , e.g. the analytical model of the stellar kinematics from the spiral arm , and also the numerical simulations with a fixed spiral arm potential and a constant pattern speed including both gas and stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
