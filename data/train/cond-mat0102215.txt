    "very recently , superconductivity at about 40 k was discovered in mgb@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite conventional bcs superconductivity has been proposed for this compound and due to the enhanced phonon frequency from the light ionic masses , the superconducting transition temperature is expected to be high .",
    "@xcite a shift in the @xmath5 due to the boron isotope has been reported with an isotope critical exponent of @xmath6.@xcite in addition , several thermodynamic parameters have been measured in this compound and these include a upper critical field @xmath7 , its slope @xmath8 the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath9 ,",
    "zero - temperature coherence length @xmath10 , and penetration depth @xmath11 etc.@xcite it is quite interesting that these thermodynamic parameters are nearly the same as those for sr@xmath12la@xmath13cuo@xmath4,@xcite whose infinite - layer structure consisting of a conducting plane ( cuo@xmath4 ) and a  metallic spacer layer ( sr , la ) is quite similar to the structure of mgb@xmath4 .",
    "the type of carrier was predicted to be positive with boron planes acting like the cuo@xmath4 planes in cuprate high - temperature superconductors@xcite , which was confirmed by a hall measurement by us.@xcite with high carrier density ( 10@xmath14 @xmath15 ) revealed by the hall measurement , the material have been reported to have characteristic metallic transport behaviors .",
    "the transport measurements for mgb@xmath4 synthesized at lower pressures ( @xmath16 gpa ) showed that a residual resistivity ratio between 300 k and 40 k was more than 20 with room temperature resistivity of about 10 @xmath17 cm , and the resistivity value increases by several tens of percent in the magnetic field of 5 tesla , and overall temperature dependence followed a @xmath18 behavior in the normal state.@xcite however , samples made at lower pressures were reported to be rather porous and mechanically weak , @xcite thus the concrete transport properties should be established for compact form of samples especially for device application .",
    "in this paper we report the physical properties of hard and dense mgb@xmath4 sintered at high temperature and high pressure ( @xmath19 gpa ) .",
    "this sample was strong enough to prepare an optically clean surface for the reflectivity measurement by polishing .",
    "we found that @xmath5 onset decreased by about 0.5 k due to the high - pressure sintering and overall temperature dependence of the resistivity in the normal state followed a @xmath1 and residual resistivity ratio was less than 3 . and",
    "near @xmath5 , the change of resistivity with magnetic field up to 5 tesla all these resistivity behaviors were different from those for samples made at lower pressures.@xcite these differences were discussed with the microscopic and structural changes caused by the high - pressure sintering .",
    "high - pressure sintering was performed with a 12-mm cubic multi - anvil - type press.@xcite commercially available powder of mgb@xmath4 ( alfa aesar ) was used to make pellets.@xcite the pellets were put into a au capsule in a high - pressure cell .",
    "one group of pellets were pressurized upto 3 gpa without subsequent heat treatment , to make a ` cold - pressed ' sample(cp - sample ) for resistivity measurement and the other group of the pellets was heated after pressurization to make a ` hot - pressed ' sample(hp - sample ) . a _",
    "d_-type thermocouple was inserted near the au capsule to monitor the temperature .",
    "it took about 2 hours to pressurize the cell to 3 gpa .",
    "after the pressurization , the heating power was increased linearly and then maintained constant for 2 hours .",
    "the sample was sintered at a temperature of @xmath20@xmath21c and then quenched to room temperature .",
    "the weight of the sample obtained in one batch was about 130 mg , and the size was about 4.5 mm in diameter and 3.3 mm in height .    a squid magnetometer ( quantum design , mpms_xl _ ) was used to measure the low - field magnetization of the samples . a scanning electron microscope ( sem )",
    "was used to investigate the surface morphology . for the resistance measurement",
    ", we cut the hp - sample by using a diamond saw with a coolant and then polished it into a rectangular solid shape with dimension .",
    "the resistance curve , @xmath22(@xmath23 ) , was measured using the standard 4-probe technique.@xcite",
    "figure [ lowfieldmt ] shows the normalized magnetic susceptibility , @xmath24 , from the measured  low - field magnetization data for two kinds of mgb@xmath4 .",
    "the curve with the broad transition is for as - purchased powder , the other curve with the symbols is for the hp - sample .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility data show that the superconducting transition width decreased from about 10 k to 1 k af ter the high - pressure sintering .",
    "the decreased field - cooling signal in the magnetic susceptibility for hp - sample indicates that the flux pinning is greatly enhanced and suggests a higher possibility of high current superconducting applications in the compact bulk form , which was also verified from the bulk - pinning behaviors in the magnetic hysteresis @xmath25.@xcite the transition temperature of the hp - sample was about 37.5 k , was slightly lower than 38 k for the as - purchased powder .",
    "figure [ rt ] shows the temperature- and the magnetic - field dependences of the resistivity .",
    "the transition width was about 0.4 k for a 10 to 90% drop of the resistivity curve .",
    "the resistivity value was @xmath26 50 and 21 @xmath27 cm at room temperature and at @xmath28 k. the metallic nature of hp - sample can be also easily inferred from its shiny surface with dark yellow tint .",
    "the overall temperature dependence of the resistivity follows a @xmath29 behavior rather than the @xmath30 form previously reported .",
    "@xcite the solid fitting line of the @xmath29 form in fig .",
    "[ rt ] nearly overlays the data , but the dashed line of the  @xmath30 form shows a significant deviation from the data .",
    "the parameters for the @xmath31 fitting are @xmath32 @xmath17 cm and  @xmath33 @xmath17cm / k@xmath34 .",
    "a fitting at lower temperature region below 100 k was not sensitive enough to distinguish clearly either form .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ rt ] shows the resistivity measured under an external magnetic field . the resistance in the normal state does not change appreciably on the external magnetic field .",
    "thus , the dependence of the resistivity either on the temperature or on the external magnetic field was quite different from the previous results measured for samples made at lower pressures.@xcite    figure [ sem ] shows sem pictures for both samples . in fig .",
    "( a ) , the grain size of the cp - sample is much less than @xmath35 @xmath36 m .",
    "the grains in the hp - sample are well connected as shown in fig .",
    "we can not even distinguish the grain boundaries over wide regions .",
    "the microscopic connections between the grains may be the reasons for hp - sample being strong and dense macroscopically .",
    "the above resistivity behaviors for hp - samples sintered at high - pressure @xmath37 gpa were also observed by other group,@xcite thus might be somehow intrinsic .",
    "most probable extrinsic origin for the different resistivity behaviors for samples made at higher pressures would be the appearance of inter - grain impurities during the high - pressure sintering which wrap around the grains and block the inter - grain current transport .",
    "however our recent study using a high - resolution transmission electron microscope showed that the impurities were well isolated from the major mgb@xmath0 phases , not forming the inter - grain layer.@xcite then the strong connectivity of the grains without inter - grain impurity might suggest that intra - grain contribution itself dominates the different resistivity behavior .",
    "the lattice parameters directly obtained from high resolution tem images were the nearly same as those of lower - pressure samples measured near 3 gpa.@xcite thus the strain caused by the high - pressure seems to remain appreciably after the sintering , which could answer partly the different transport behavior in some way .",
    "the observed difference of @xmath5 between hp - sample and cp - sample was less than about 0.5 k , which is much smaller than reported @xmath5 reduction by 4.8 k upon applying 3  gpa.@xcite the different @xmath5 reduction may be partly due to different pressurization method and/or the different distribution of strains inside the sample .",
    "the identification of the exact origin for the different resistivity behaviors still needs more studies .",
    "in summary , we report the temperature- and magnetic - field - dependant resistivity of a hard and dense mgb@xmath4 sintered at high temperature and high pressure ( @xmath19 gpa ) .",
    "the superconducting transition width for the resistivity measurement was about 0.4 k , and the resistivity in the normal state followed a behavior of @xmath1 .",
    "the absolute values of the resistivity at room temperature and at just above @xmath5 were 50 to 21 @xmath17 cm respectively . also , the resistivity in the normal state did not change appreciably with the applied magnetic field up to 5 t. these behaviors are different from those for samples made at lower pressures and maybe are partly due to the presence of strain caused by high - pressure condition for the sintering .",
