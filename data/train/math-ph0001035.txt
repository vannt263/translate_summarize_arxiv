    "in the study of anderson localization the analogy with the statistical mechanics of spin systems has often served as a source of insight @xcite . in this note",
    "we report on some recent results @xcite which were motivated in part by this analogy , and in part by the desire to develop elementary methods for the study of different aspects of the localization phenomena .",
    "our goal is to present only an outline  the detailed statements and proofs are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the subject of our discussion are random operators acting on the hilbert space @xmath0 of square summable functions defined over the regular @xmath1-dimensional lattice @xmath2 .",
    "a prototypical example is the discrete schrdinger operator : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a random potential , and @xmath5 is the nearest neighbor difference operator ( `` discrete laplacian '' ) .",
    "the operator may be augmented by the addition of a magnetic field , and/or random off - diagonal hopping terms . however ,",
    "for our results we assume translation invariance at least in the stochastic sense and up to gauge transformations ( i.e. , magnetic shifts ) .",
    "( the statements may also be adapted to periodic and quasi - periodic structures . )",
    "it is now well understood that such operators have energy regimes in which the spectrum consists of an infinite collection of eigenvalues associated to exponentially localized eigenfunctions .",
    "it is also expected , although the theory is sorely lacking , that in certain situations such operators also possess energy regions associated to extended states .    a very useful tool is provided by the green function of @xmath6 : @xmath7 to illustrate the relation with spin systems one may note the analogy between @xmath8 and the spin - spin correlation functions suggested by the functional integral expression for the former as a gaussian integral : @xmath9      \\ , \\e^{- \\iu \\left < \\phi , ( h_{\\omega } - e - \\iu      \\eta ) \\phi \\right >   } \\ , \\phi(x ) \\phi(y )      \\over      \\int [ { \\mathcal d } \\phi ] \\ ,      \\e^{-",
    "\\iu \\left < \\phi , ( h_{\\omega } - e - \\iu      \\eta ) \\phi \\right > } } \\ ; .\\ ] ] the relevant rigorous methods familiar from the study of spin systems do not apply here since the integral involves a complex action .",
    "nevertheless , exponential bounds for @xmath8 in the limit @xmath10 are a `` signature '' of the localized regime , much as exponential decay of spin - spin correlations indicates the high - temperature regime .",
    "since the green function depends on the disorder , it is tempting to consider the averaged function @xmath11 , where @xmath12 indicates the expectation with respect to the potential .",
    "however , for @xmath13 in the spectrum of @xmath6 , this quantity may diverge as @xmath10 . as was realized in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can avoid this problem by considering a `` fractional moment '' of the green function : @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "thus , a technically convenient `` signature '' of localization is the exponential decay of such fractional moments , at some suitable @xmath16 , @xmath17 where the bound is satisfied uniformly in @xmath18 for all energies in some range @xmath19 .",
    "before we turn to the new results , which offer constructive criteria for the validity of the fractional moment condition ( [ eq : fm ] ) , let us list several known implications of this condition , each of which also presumes some mild regularity conditions on the distribution of the random potential :    * _ spectral localization ( @xcite - using @xcite ) : _ the spectrum of @xmath20 within the interval @xmath21 is almost - surely of the pure - point type , and the corresponding eigenfunctions are exponentially localized .",
    "* _ dynamical localization ( @xcite ) : _ wave packets with energies in the specified range do not spread ( and in particular the _ sule _ condition of @xcite is met ) : @xmath22 * _ absence of level repulsion ( @xcite ) .",
    "_ minami has shown that ( [ eq : fm ] ) implies that in the range @xmath21 the energy gaps have poisson - type statistics . *",
    "_ exponential decay of the projection kernel ( @xcite ) _ : @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the fractional moment condition ( [ eq : fm ] ) has already been established for certain regimes : large disorder and extreme energies @xcite , and also at weak disorder but for energies far from the spectrum of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "our new results extend the reach of the fractional moment method by showing that the entire region in which ( [ eq : fm ] ) holds can , in principle , be determined by a sequence of finite calculations .    in their general appearance",
    ", these results may remind one of some of the constructive criteria for the high temperature phases in certain models of statistical mechanics , which are mentioned below . as in that case",
    ", the results also yield some conclusions about the critical behavior , which in the present context refers to the behaviour in the vicinity of the mobility edge  wherever such an edge occurs .    before the introduction of the fractional - moment method",
    ", localization regimes have been established using the multiscale analysis of frhlich and spencer @xcite which yields exponential bounds of the form : @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 for almost every @xmath28 and all @xmath29 .",
    "the bounds which the multiscale analysis provides for the probability of the exceptional cases decay faster than any power of @xmath30 but not exponentially fast .",
    "it is difficult to use such results to demonstrate exponential bounds on _ expectation values _ such as those seen in equations ( [ eq : projection ] ) and ( [ eq : dyn ] ) .",
    "nevertheless we note that dynamical localization was recently established also by arguments starting from the bounds provided by the multiscale analysis @xcite , using methods not related to this work .",
    "we shall return to the relation between the fractional - moment method and the multiscale analysis in the final section of this note .",
    "the results presented herein describe certain conditions which when satisfied by the operator @xmath31 obtained by restricting @xmath6 to some finite volume @xmath32 are sufficient to deduce the fractional moment condition ( [ eq : fm ] ) for the full operator @xmath6 . for simplicity we state these results only in the case of random schrdinger operators .",
    "the reader is directed to @xcite for versions which apply to more general operators .    to guarantee that the fractional moments are finite",
    ", we require certain regularity of the joint probability distribution of the site potentials @xmath33 .",
    "an additional technical assumption related to the `` decoupling lemmas '' used in @xcite is also required . in their mildest form",
    "the conditions required are somewhat technical to state , so for the present note we shall call a probabilty distribution of the potential _ regular _ if the site values @xmath33 are independent identically distributed random variables whose distribution has a bounded density with compact support .",
    "the interested reader may find the more general assumptions in @xcite .    in order to state our results",
    ", we must introduce some notation . given a finite region @xmath34 , we denote by @xmath35 the set of lattice bonds ( nearest neighbor pairs ) connecting sites in @xmath32 with sites in @xmath36 , and by @xmath37 the region obtained from @xmath32 by adding to it all of its nearest neighbors .",
    "the number of elements of a set @xmath38 is denoted @xmath39 .    as mentioned above",
    ", @xmath40 indicates the expectation with respect to the random potential .",
    "we also let @xmath41    following is the first of our results .",
    "[ thm:1 ] let @xmath20 be a random schrdinger operator with a regular distribution of the random potential .",
    "then for each @xmath15 there exists @xmath42 such that if for some @xmath43 ( in fact also @xmath44 ) and some finite region @xmath45 which contains the origin @xmath46 : @xmath47 then @xmath20 satisfies the fractional - moment condition ( [ eq : fm ] ) , and there exist @xmath48 , which depend on @xmath13 only through the value of the lhs in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cond1 ] ) , so that for any region @xmath49 , @xmath50 with @xmath51 \\ } \\ ; . \\label{eq : dist}\\ ] ]    the modified metric , @xmath52 , is a distance function relative to which the entire boundary of @xmath53 is regarded as one point .",
    "it permits us to state that there is exponential decay in the `` bulk '' without ruling out the possible existence of extended _ boundary states _ in some geometry .",
    "one may also formulate finite - volume criteria which rule out extended boundary states , that is which permit us to conclude exponential decay of the fractional moments in _ any _ region @xmath53 .",
    "the trade - off is that the finite volume test , presented in the next result , is a bit more involved .",
    "[ thm:2 ] let @xmath20 be a random schrdinger operator with a regular distribution of the random potential .",
    "then for each @xmath15 there exists @xmath54 such that if for some @xmath55 ( alternatively , complex @xmath13 ) and some finite region @xmath56 : @xmath57 then there are @xmath58 and @xmath59  which depend on the energy @xmath13 only through the value of the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cond2 ] )  such that for any region @xmath49",
    "@xmath60    it is rather obvious that the collection of finite - volume criteria provided in theorem  [ thm:2 ] covers the entire regime in which the conclusion , eq .",
    "( [ eq : thm2 ] ) , holds . the corresponding statement for theorem  [ thm:1 ]",
    "is a bit less immediate , but it is also true :    let @xmath20 be a random schrdinger operator with a regular distribution of the random potential , and fix @xmath15 . if at some energy @xmath13 ( or @xmath61 ) the localization condition ( [ eq : fm ] ) is satisfied , with some @xmath62 and @xmath63 , then for all large enough ( but finite ) @xmath64 the condition ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) is met for @xmath65^d$ ] .",
    "we shall now mention a number of implications of the finite - volume criteria for fractional moment localization .    first ,",
    "of course , are explicit bounds , and we already obtain such bounds with a single site estimate corresponding to @xmath66 .",
    "the test provided by theorem  [ thm:2 ] is met for all @xmath67 and @xmath13 such that : @xmath68 this implies localization for strong disorder , and at extremal energies , in the manner of ref .",
    "@xcite .    the above explicit criterion may now be systematically improved .",
    "however , since the calculations quickly become quite laborious , perhaps the main benefit are certain qualitative statements .",
    "those bear some resemblance to results derived using the multiscale approach ; however the conclusions drawn here go beyond the latter by yielding results on the exponential decay of the _",
    "mean values_.      an interesting and useful implication ( as seen below ) is that fast enough power law implies exponential decay . in this sense ,",
    "random schrdinger operators join other statistical mechanical models in which such principles have been previously recognized .",
    "the list includes the general dobrushin - shlosman results  @xcite and the more specific two - point function bounds for : percolation @xcite , ising ferromagnets @xcite , certain @xmath70 models @xcite , and time - evolution models @xcite .",
    "let @xmath20 be a random schrdinger operator on @xmath0 with a regular potential . then there are @xmath71 such that if for some @xmath55 and some finite @xmath72 , either @xmath73 or @xmath74 where @xmath75^d$ ] and @xmath76 , then the _ exponential _ localization ( [ eq : fm ] ) holds for all energies in some open interval @xmath21 containing @xmath13 .",
    "[ thm : power=>exp ]      boundary points of the continuous spectrum are referred to as _ mobility edges_. the random schrdinger operators considered here are ergodic , hence the location of such points does not depend on the realization @xcite . however , except for the bethe lattice  @xcite , the proof of the occurrence of continuous spectrum is still an open problem .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to note that theorem  [ thm : power=>exp ] yields the following pair of lower bounds on the decay rate of the green function at mobility edges , @xmath78 , for a random schrdinger operator with regular potential : @xmath79^d ; \\omega } - e_{{\\rm edge } } } |y>|^s              \\right ) \\",
    "l^{-3(d-1 ) } \\ ; , \\label{eq : mobilityedge1}\\ ] ] and @xmath80 we do not expect these bounds to be optimal .",
    "the following statement is of somewhat technical interest , but it has interesting implications , such as the decay of the projection kernel , for which it is useful to have bounds on the resolvent at @xmath81 which are uniform in @xmath82 .",
    "such bounds permit integrating the resolvent estimates along contours which cut the real axis , as in the derivation of ( eq .  ( [ eq : projection ] ) ) in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let @xmath20 be a random schrdinger operator with a regular potential .",
    "suppose that for some @xmath55 , and @xmath83 , the following bound holds uniformly for @xmath84 $ ] : @xmath85 then for all @xmath18 : @xmath86 with some @xmath87 and @xmath88  which depend on @xmath89 and the bound ( [ eq : real ] ) . [ thm : strip ]      the finite volume criteria presented above allow us to conclude exponential localization from suitable bounds on the density of states of the operators in regions @xmath90^d$ ] .",
    "the following statement will be useful for such a purpose .",

    "[ thm : density ]    * remarks : * 1 .",
    "it is of interest to combine the criterion presented above with lifschitz tail estimates on the density of states at the bottom of the spectrum and at band edges . as an example , consider the bottom of the spectrum of @xmath6 : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the minimum value in the support of @xmath103",
