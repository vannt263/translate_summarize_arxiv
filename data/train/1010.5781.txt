    "nowadays it is well - established that a massive dark object , very possibly a massive black hole ( mbh ) with a mass of about @xmath8 , is lurking in the centre of the milky way @xcite . while there is an emerging consensus about the origin and growth of supermassive black holes ( smbh",
    ", with masses about or larger than @xmath9 ) , mbhs with smaller masses such as the one in the galactic centre remain a ( relatively ) understudied enigma .",
    "one of the keys to understanding the growth and evolution of mbhs in this lower mass range resides in the dynamics of stars in their vicinity .",
    "this is the case mainly because relaxation times there are low enough that the surrounding stellar systems should have had enough time  through two - body relaxation _",
    "alone_to evolve towards a steady - state which is independent of the particular initial conditions at the time of formation .",
    "the galactic center is thought to fulfill such condition .",
    "it is the universality of such relaxed stellar nuclei that gives us a crucial predictive power on the expected properties of the mbh environment , on the stellar candidates for close interaction with the central mbh and on the resulting gravitational wave ( gw ) signatures . if , on the contrary , non - relaxed systems were generic , then one would need to resort to _ case - by - case modelling of each galactic nucleus_.    the ideal probe for these innermost regions of galaxies is the gw radiation that is emitted by stellar bhs and other compact objects that come very close to the mbh .",
    "one of the main channels for interaction between stars and a central mbh is the adiabatic , slow inspiral of compact remnants ( cr ) into the mbh due to the emission of gws  an emri . during such an event ,",
    "the small body effectively acts as a probe of spacetime close to the mbh as its orbit slowly shrinks due to the energy and angular momentum lost in the form of gw radiation . in case of @xmath10 mbhs , after some @xmath11 orbits in the lisa band ( @xmath12 hz and a periapsis @xmath13 , since we only consider sources which are completely embedded in the band , and not bursting sources ) , the small body eventually merges with the mbh .",
    "the information contained in the waves will allow us to determine the parameters of these binary system with an unprecedented accuracy ( see for instance * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , corroborate the existence of mbhs and maybe even provide the first direct detection of an intermediate mbh ( in case the primary is @xmath14 ) .",
    "_ lisa _ will thus scrutinize exactly the mass range about which electromagnetic observational information is currently lacking . in its most general form , the emri problem  the astrophysical modelling of event rates and parameters for emris ",
    "spans many orders of magnitude . from the bulge regions at few@xmath15 pc , where the dynamics is essentially collisionless but from where single stellar bhs and binaries with crs originate",
    "; down to the parsec scale of the nucleus itself which evolves secularly over ( local ) relaxation timescales ; and then further down to milliparsec scales where relativistic effects start to dominate the evolution .",
    "but , however , once a steady state configuration establishes itself in the central parsec region , the emri rates are rather expected to depend strongly on the ( universal ) density distribution of crs within ( in order of magnitude ) @xmath16 from the hole .",
    "this is indeed the region from which these inspiralling sources are expected to originate @xcite .",
    "the dynamics in this tiny volume has been rather unexplored until the relevance of emris and sub - parsec observations of the galactic center have raised its interest . since then",
    ", many authors have devoted a number of works to the analysis of this peculiar regime @xcite .",
    "we discuss in this work the stellar distribution of dense stellar systems around mbhs in the lisa mass range .",
    "realistic modeling of mass segregation  which is the natural outcome for any realistic stellar population  will strongly impact the expected emri rates , since it favors the accumulation of heavier objects towards the center @xcite . in section @xmath6 ,",
    "we begin by summarizing the results obtained by @xcite that show how to calibrate the fp calculations with direct @xmath17-body simulations - body simulations compute the gravitational accelerations between particles using the exact newton s law , without introducing any approximations to compute the gravitational potential @xcite . ] ; then , still in the same section , we present new results concerning the robustness of @xmath17-body realisations of stellar cusp growth with respect to the total particle number @xmath17 . in section @xmath18",
    ", we present new results on the growth of stellar cusps from a variety of initial conditions resulting from carving a cavity in the star s phase space distribution function .",
    "this is motivated from a variety of astrophysical mechanisms that may lead to cusp destruction ; and these mechanisms are critically assessed in the end of the section .",
    "we show that , under very generic circumstances , the time required for the growth of a cusp is shorter than a hubble time . therefore , quasi - steady , mass segregated , stellar cusps are expected to be common around mbhs in the lisa mass range . but see @xcite and @xcite for different perspectives .",
    "emri detection rates for _ lisa _ are expected to peak for @xmath19 @xcite leading us to conclude that at least a sizeable fraction of these events should originate from strongly segregated cusps . finally , in section @xmath20 we present new estimates on the expected emri rates in mass segregated nuclei and conclude that our realistic modeling of mass segregation has a significant impact on these rates .",
    "the distribution of stars around a massive black hole is a classical problem in stellar dynamics @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown , through a kinetic treatment that , within the radius of gravitational influence of the hole @xmath21 , in case all stars are of the same mass , this quasi - steady distribution takes the form of power laws , @xmath22 , in physical space with @xmath23 the stellar density at a radius @xmath24 and @xmath25 in energy space ( with @xmath26 the energy and @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "this is the so - called _ zero - flow solution _ for which the net flux of stars in energy space is _ precisely _ zero .",
    "@xcite and @xcite were the first to demonstrate the robustness of the corresponding direct - summation @xmath17-body realizations , and have therefore validated the assumptions inherent to the fokker - planck ( fp ) approximation  namely , that scattering is dominated by uncorrelated , @xmath6-body encounters and , in particular , dense stellar cusps ; it is said to be a _ cusp _ if @xmath29 . ] populated with stars of the _ same mass _ are robust against ejection of stars from the cusp .",
    "the latter result is not trivial as for a bw @xmath27 cusp stellar densities are extremely high at the center and the fraction of stars with speeds close to the escape velocity from the cusp is quite high at all radii @xmath30 , with @xmath21 the influence radius of the mbh @xcite .",
    "single mass models are very poor approximations of real stellar populations .",
    "to first order of approximation , an evolved stellar population can be represented by two ( well - separated ) mass scales : one in the range @xmath31 corresponding to low mass main - sequence stars , white dwarfs ( wds ) and neutron stars ( nss ) ; another with @xmath32 representing stellar bhs .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , here we restrict our discussion to models with two mass components and leave the more general case to another work in preparation @xcite .",
    "when stars of two different masses are present , there is mass segregation which is a process by which the heavy stars accumulate near the center while the lighter ones float outward @xcite .",
    "accordingly , stars with different mass get distributed with different density profiles .",
    "@xcite , henceforth bw77 , have argued heuristically that a scaling relation @xmath33 ( where the subindices @xmath34 , @xmath35 refer to the light or heavy components ) establishes itself and depends only on the mass ratio . here , as in the single - mass case , the crucial assumption is that all components are abundant enough that they undergo enough scattering among themselves and with the other components as to stabilize into an approximate _ zero - flow _ solution .",
    "obviously , this can not happen independently of the number fraction of the different stellar masses @xcite . in the realistic situation where the number fraction of heavy objects ( in our case , stellar bhs ) is small , a new solution coined by @xcite as _ strong mass segregation _ ( sms ) obtains with density of heavy objects scaling as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "the solution has two branches and can be parametrized by the parameter    @xmath38    where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the total number of light and heavy stars , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the corresponding individual masses .",
    "@xmath43 provides a measure of the importance of the heavy star s self - coupling relative to the light - heavy coupling ( in terms of the @xmath44 and @xmath45 order diffusion coefficients ) ; and it depends essentially on the mass _ and _ number ratios , which is one parameter more than proposed by bw77 .",
    "the @xmath46 branch , for @xmath47 corresponds to the scaling relations found by bw77 ; while the @xmath48 branch , for @xmath49 , generalizes the bw77 solution .",
    "stellar populations with continuous star formation and an initial mass function ( imf ) given by @xmath50 will be characterized by @xmath49 if @xmath51 and @xmath49 otherwise ; and , in particular , salpeter and kroupa s imf generate evolved stellar populations with @xmath52 @xcite .",

    "red curves are from fp calculations , green curves are from nb simulations .",
    "the agreement between both methods is quite good .",
    "the mass ratio between heavy and light stars is @xmath56 , representing the expected typical mass ratio between light stars ( ms stars , wds and nss ) and stellar bhs , as explained in the text ; the number fraction of heavy stars @xmath57 ( top and middle panels ) and @xmath58 ( lower panels ) , corresponding to the strong and weak segregation regimes respectively .",
    "the initial condition is a dehnen profile with central slope @xmath59 for the top and bottom panels @xcite , @xmath60 in the middle panel ; a central mbh with @xmath61 of the total mass of the cluster and @xmath62 likewise .",
    "the particle number is @xmath63 ( top and bottom ) and @xmath64 ( middle ) . the asymptotic slope @xmath65 decreases from @xmath66 to @xmath67 when moving from the strong to the weak branch of the solution .",

    ", they barely interact with each other and instead sink to the center due to dynamical friction against the sea of light stars .",
    "therefore , a quasi - steady state develops in which the heavy star s current is _ not _ nearly zero and thus the bw77 solution does not hold exactly anymore .",
    "indeed , in the limit where the number fraction @xmath70 of heavy stars is vanishingly small , as is the case of nuclei with realistic imfs , the stellar potential is dominated by the light component . in this case , the light stars should evolve as if in isolation and develop a @xmath71 density cusp .",
    "the scarce heavy stars sink to the center due to dynamical friction against the background of light stars , and will not exert any significant back - reaction on them @xcite .",

    "the former value was chosen to be close to the number fraction of stellar bhs to be expected from a standard salpeter or kroupa s imf ; the latter value is chosen to be representative of the regime of weak segregation studied by bw77 .",
    "one can see from figure 1 that in the case of weak segregation @xmath85 everywhere due to the extremely high number of heavy objects ; in contrast , in the sms regime @xmath86 only for @xmath87 ( and the light objects dominate in number almost everywhere ) . in all cases",
    "the asymptotic slopes are valid within @xmath88 and are totally predictable once @xmath43 is known .",
    "these results agree pretty well with the predictions for the sms regime @xcite .",
    "the particle number in our direct - summation @xmath0body simulations sample ranges from @xmath63 to @xmath64 ; our results do not show evidence of any dependence on total @xmath17 , nor on the initial value of @xmath74 , once the results are re - scaled appropriately ( _ i.e. _ measured in terms of the relaxation time ) .",
    "the agreement between nb and fp methods is quite good in all cases .",
    "we have seen that theory predicts a steady state cusp that reaches extremely high densities in the center near the mbh .",
    "furthermore , given a normalization at , say , @xmath21 and a knowledge of the stellar mass function ( and thus of @xmath43 ) , the density profile inside @xmath21 becomes completely determined .",
    "but observations are much more complicated to interpret .",
    "first , one must realize that there are very few galaxies for which the influence radius @xmath21 can be resolved .",
    "in fact , except for the nearest galaxies , @xmath21 covers an angular region in the sky which is too small to be resolved even with the hst .",
    "the hst has an angular resolution of @xmath89 . in the case of galaxies in the virgo cluster , at @xmath90 mpc of distance",
    ", it can only resolve regions with linear sizes @xmath91 pc .",
    "therefore , hst would not be able to resolve sgra * s radius of influence if it were at the distance of virgo . since @xmath92",
    ", it can only start to resolve the influence radius of virgo s mbhs that have masses @xmath93 .",
    "second , even in the few cases for which @xmath21 can be resolved to some extent , it still is necessary to assess whether the observed stars ( only those that are bright enough to be detected ) really trace the underlying ( dynamically dominant ) invisible population .",
    "third , given the fact that , as we have seen , stars tend to segregate by mass , there is an extra uncertainty related to the unknown stellar mass function .",
    "moreover , there are indications that star formation events are common in galactic nuclei and furthermore that the resulting imf in these sub - parsec regions may be substantially different from that of the field stars and biased towards heavy masses @xcite .",
    "finally , it is necessary to deproject the observations and , in the ( inevitable ) absence of complete knowledge of phase space coordinates , one must rely on kinematic assumptions regarding the ( an-)isotropy of stellar velocities and on the three dimensional shape of the stellar system .",
    "time for cusp re - growth .",
    "single - mass relaxation time at @xmath21 for single - mass cored models as a function of mbh mass .",
    "the shaded area covers @xmath94$]the time for cusp re - growth if there is no hole in the initial df .",
    "the three dashed lines above the shaded region represent the average time needed for the cusp re - growth in case one imposes an initial cavity with size @xmath95 or @xmath6 pc .",
    "the horizontal dashed curve represents 13 gyr .",
    "it can be seen that the time needed to re - grow a cusp around mbh with masses @xmath1 is below a hubble time so long as the initial cavity is smaller than @xmath96 pc .",
    "nevertheless , it has come as a surprise that very recent spectroscopic observations of the galactic center revealed a core ( or even a dip ) in the surface distribution of the old stellar population ( essentially red giants ) which should have had time to relax into a cuspy density profile .",
    "the caveat is that the detected stars are still a small fraction , of about 5% , of the stellar population as a whole and therefore do not exclude the presence of an extended dark cluster ( presumably made of stellar bhs and other crs)which would indeed agree with our theoretical expectations .      to assess the likelihood that the galactic center is indeed unrelaxed , it is natural to ask : how long does it take to re - grow a cusp",
    "if , at some point , it has been destroyed ?",
    "a complete answer will , of course , depend on the extent to which the cusp was destroyed , _",
    "i.e. _ how much mass was expelled from the original cusp and over which radial range . at this level , it does not matter very much which mechanism led to the destruction of the cusp .",
    "we discuss briefly possible scenarios for cusp destruction at the end of the section .    in order to investigate this question ,",
    "we have concocted a set of initial conditions purported to mimic the outcome of a destroying cusp event  such as the carving of a cavity in phase space through the ejection of stars by , say , an infalling imbh or , following a major merger , by a mbh .",
    "we model the outcome of such an event by imposing that all stars with binding energies larger than some @xmath97 or almost equivalently , with semimajor axis smaller than @xmath98 , are not present in the initial df .",
    "in fact , inside @xmath21 the mbh dominates the gravitational potential and @xmath99 .",
    "we thus set up an initial dehnen model with @xmath100 for @xmath101in other words , there is an initial cavity in the phase space df , but not in physical space as the stars with lower energy still entail @xmath102 at the center , although with a smaller amplitude than the original model .",
    "the values of @xmath97 were chosen to represent cavities of size @xmath103 pc resulting from the inspiral of an imbh / mbh .",
    "note that these models are , by construction , isotropic in the velocity distribution . or @xmath104 maximum . ]",
    "our fiducial model is a milky way type nucleus with @xmath105 , some @xmath106 in total stellar mass inside @xmath107 pc distributed according to an initial central density slope @xmath60 , two components with masses @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and @xmath110 of stellar bhs by number .",
    "when the stellar distribution has no phase space cavity , this translates into having stars down to roughly @xmath111 pc .",
    "having validated the fp models with detailed @xmath17-body simulations , we now proceed in the rest of the paper to describe results obtained with the ( much faster ) fp approach .",
    "figure 2 shows the times for cusp re - growth computed with fp for different galactic nuclei models .",
    "the time for cusp re - growth is defined as the time it takes for a given initial density profile ( @xmath23 in space or @xmath112 in phase space , with or without an initial cavity ) to reach its asymptotic slope , which depends on @xmath43 , down to @xmath113 .",
    "this is indeed the scale which is resolved by recent observations of the galactic center @xcite .",
    "the shaded region represents the time of cusp re - growth for a range of @xmath114 and @xmath70 ( all in the sms regime , @xmath115 ) for the case where @xmath112 extends to high @xmath26 without any cut .",
    "it can be seen that , for @xmath116 , cusps grow in less than a hubble time ; in the particular case of the milky way nucleus with @xmath117 , it takes no longer than @xmath118 gyr to fully re - grow a steady - state , mass segregated , stellar cusp and only @xmath119 gyr to have it grown down to @xmath120 .",
    "if , instead , an initial cavity is imposed at the center with size @xmath95 or @xmath6 pc in case of the milky way ( or @xmath121 or @xmath122 in case of a generic nucleus ) , times for re - growth are represented by the dashed curves above the shaded region . in this case , times for cusp re - growth increase ; in the milky way case , it becomes @xmath123 or @xmath124 gyr , respectively .",
    "note that , in the mass range @xmath10 , the times for cusp re - growth are definitely _ much shorter _ than a hubble time  even if a fairly large cavity of size comparablee to @xmath21 is hypothesized .",
    "the full curve represents the relaxation times computed at the radius of influence @xmath21 , while the dashed curves represent the _ actual _ times for cusp re - growth as measured from fp calculations @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to devise plausible mechanisms for the formation of such large cores in the stellar distribution .",
    "for instance , the inspiral of an imbh of mass @xmath125 that forms an unequal - mass binary with the mbh and ejects stars through three body encounters would tend to progressively wipe out the stellar cusp . however , the core radius carved by such an event is @xmath126 pc @xcite and thus a steady inflow of such imbhs ( one every @xmath127 years for a hubble time ) would be required in order to carve a large core @xmath128 or @xmath129 larger .",
    "such large inflow of imbhs have been proposed by @xcite .",
    "this does not seem very likely anymore in light of the fact that such imbhs were hypothesized to be formed by runaway mergers of stars in the center of globular clusters .",
    "however , at solar metallicities , such mechanism seems very inneficient .",
    "mass loss due to very strong winds severely limits the growth of the stellar object being formed and the likely end result of a runaway merger is a @xmath130 wolf - rayet star . at lower metallicities ,",
    "mass loss is lower and the remnant can be more massive @xmath131 , but in any case it will not form an imbh . in sum , it looks very unlikely that sufficient imbhs can be formed in order to generate such steady inflow to the galactic center .",
    "another possibility would be that sgra * is a binary mbh , but this would most likely imply that there has been a , more or less recent , major merger involving the milky way .",
    "this would contradict the apparent pure - disk nature of the galaxy , as theoretical interpretations of stellar kinematic data of the galactic bulge seem to favor that the bulge is part of the disk and not a separate component resulting from a merger @xcitey  aside from the fact that there are strong constraints from the sgra * proper motion @xcite .",
    "stars in a keplerian potential , @xmath132 , do not precess because of the @xmath133 resonance between their radial and azimuthal frequencies .",
    "resonant relaxation ( rr ) results from the coherent torques that such stars exert on each other leading to a fast evolution of their orbital angular momenta over timescales @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the precession timescale due to departures from an exact kepler potential @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that rr , by increasing the rate of angular momentum diffusion in the near - keplerian gravitational potential around the mbh , may boost the tidal disruption rate of stars and could thus create a near - cavity ( out to @xmath136 pc ) in the stellar distribution .",
    "it is certain that rr operates to some extent in the inner parsec , but we doubt it can completetly explain the dearth of red giant stars there or , more generally , the full destruction of a cusp  including crs such as stellar bhs first , their final density distribution does not show a cavity , nor a shallow cusp profile , for @xmath137 pc ; instead , they get final slopes @xmath138 for @xmath137 pc .",
    "this is in contrast with observations which show a decaying density for @xmath139 pc .",
    "second , we believe that their monte - carlo calculations severely underestimate the rate at which the cusp re - grows ; in fact , they obtain a timescale which is @xmath140 times longer than that obtained with our @xmath17-body simulations ( which are free from any simplifying dynamical assumptions ) , and also from ours and their own recent fp calculations @xcite .",
    "third , were they to use the latter rates , and given that the time rr takes to deplete the cusp is of the same order as the time we obtain for cusp re - growth , the net effect of rr on the cusp would likely be minute . moreover , stellar bhs can not be tidally disrupted , and this makes them less susceptible to be extracted from the cusp than @xmath141 stars .",
    "given a steady state stellar bhs continue to diffuse in @xmath142-space and some of them eventually come into close interaction with the mbh . during a close interaction ,",
    "a stellar bh can either be promptly scattered into the mbh , accompanied by a single or a few brief bursts of gws in the _ lisa _ band  the so - called `` direct - plunges'' , though they are not likely detectable unless if emitted from the galactic center @xcite , or scattered outwards in the cusp . in either case",
    ", it does not live enough to become an emri .",
    "alternatively , it may undergo a very slow , adiabatic , inspiral without being appreciably disturbed by other stars and , in this case , it will eventually become an emri detectable by lisa .",
    "an emri object thus has to spend very many orbits without being significantly scattered by the gravitational tugs of the other stars .",
    "in other words , they must fullfill the following _ inspiralling criterion _ : the time @xmath143 it takes for the inspiral , due to orbital energy lost by gw emission only , must be shorter than the typical time @xmath144 it takes on average to drift in angular momentum by an amount @xmath145 which equals its orbital angular momentum .",
    "otherwise , they will be promptly captured by the mbh before entering the lisa band .",
    "the inspiral criterion can be stated in terms of the parameter @xmath146 being smaller than unity , @xmath147 . for @xmath148 , it is almost certain that this object has either taken an almost radial orbit and fallen into the mbh as a direct plunge or has been scattered outwards .",
    "will be compensated by another that drifts inward by the same amount .",
    "this balance only breaks down for those orbits that fall on to the hole , since there are obviously no stars coming out of it to keep detailed balancing . ]",
    "it turns out that this parameter simply scales with orbital s semimajor axis : @xmath149 @xcite , which means that it is a decreasing function of @xmath150 so long as @xmath151 .",
    "this is indeed the case in both regimes of mass segregation .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have shown that the probability for a successful inspiral as a function of orbital semimajor axis ( or energy ) is almost a step function of semimajor axis .",
    "if @xmath152 , it is almost certain that the stellar bh will become an emri ; it will almost certainly not become one in case the inequality sign is reversed ( and the width of the `` transition region '' is very small ) .",
    "this crucial threshold quantity demarcates the orbits which are close enough to the mbh to sucessfully decouple from the rest of the cluster and undergo the slow , adiabatic inspiral that defines an emri from those more weakly bound orbits that will be perturbed out of the emri tracks due to scattering with other stars .",
    "therefore , in order to estimate the emri event rate , given a steady state @xmath112 , obtained via the fp equation , one essentially counts the number of stars that populate the region of phase space for which the inspiralling criterion above is satisfied and divide it by the local relaxation time .",
    "note that here , for simplicity , we ignore other driving mechanisms  in particular , we ignore resonant relaxation . under these assumptions ,",
    "the emri rate for stellar bhs is approximately given by    @xmath153    where @xmath154 is the number fraction of sbhs in the stellar population , @xmath155 is the total number of stars per unit energy(@xmath156 , see @xcite ) , @xmath157 is the specific angular momentum of a circular orbit of energy @xmath26 , @xmath158 is the loss - cone angular momentum and @xmath159 $ ] is the relaxation time .",
    "the log term in the denominator in  ( [ emri - rate ] ) arises from the phase space ( partial ) depletion resulting from the presence of the loss cone .",
    "the conversion between @xmath24 and @xmath26 is , for @xmath160 , @xmath161 or @xmath162 .",
    "the critical radius @xmath163 , or energy @xmath164 , for emris is approximately @xmath165 ; and , to first order , @xmath163 is independent of @xmath166 @xcite .",
    "the weak regime of sms , and corresponding bw solution , would lead to a fairly high intrinsic rate , per galaxy , of emris .",
    "in fact , figure 3 shows that , for a milky way nucleus , in case @xmath47 , the intrinsic emri rate is @xmath167 per gyr .",
    "this is , however , unrealistic as such scenario pressuposes an unrealistically high number fraction of bhs ( @xmath168 for @xmath169 ) . in the more realistic case , when @xmath170 the bw solution would entail a strong supression of the emri rate to  at best  a few tens of events per gyr",
    "this is where sms solution appears to rescue us .",
    "sms implies a higher density of bhs inside @xmath21 as compared with the @xmath27 solution , and in this way  by decreasing the local @xmath171 and increasing @xmath155 close to the mbh  it partially , but not completely , compensates for the small number fraction of bhs entailed by realistic mass functions .",
    "emri rate as a function of @xmath43 .",
    "the number of stellar bh emri events per gyr in a milky way type nucleus ( @xmath105 and @xmath172 ) as a function of the parameter @xmath43 .",
    "this is computed from a two - component mass segregated stellar cusp ( @xmath173 and @xmath174 ) with mass ratios @xmath56 and @xmath175 obtained from fp calculations . in the case of the fiducial value @xmath176 , @xmath177 ; in those circumstances , each milky way like nucleus will produce on average @xmath4 stellar bh emris per gyr .    in order to quantitatively evaluate the boost @xmath178 to the emri rates from sms , for a given @xmath43 and a fixed mass normalization at @xmath21 , one needs to estimate what would be the rate if the spatial and phase space densities were determined by the @xmath27 cusp for @xmath179 .",
    "this is done as follows : we define analytically both @xmath23 and @xmath112 that would result from a @xmath27 inside @xmath69 @xmath180 and @xmath181 where the indices fp mean that the profile is taken from the fokker - planck calculation .",
    "@xmath182 ( and @xmath183 is a reference radius ( energy ) chosen according to @xmath184 .    * figure 4 .",
    "* boost on the emri rates from strong segregation .",
    "one can see that , for values of @xmath49 , there is a significant boost to the emri rates in comparison to which it would result in the case of a @xmath27 bw cusp .",
    "in particular , for our fiducial value @xmath170 ( @xmath185 ) , the boost is of order of a factor @xmath186 with respect to a @xmath187-bw cusp with the same mass normalization at @xmath188 pc .",
    "figure 4 shows the boost to the emri rates due to sms relative to what would be obtained from a bw profile .",
    "going from an unrealistically high @xmath154 , as adopted by bw77 ( say @xmath189 ) , to a more realistic @xmath154 ( say @xmath190 ) , while neglecting the existence of sms , one supresses the emri rate by factors of @xmath191 ( the former would lead to @xmath192 emris per gyr ; the latter is reduced to @xmath193 few tens per gyr ) .",
    "however , by taking into account the sms solution , for this low @xmath190 , we boost again the rates by a factor close to @xmath186 , thus partially compensating the reduction of emris ( from few tens to a few hundred per gyr ; in fact , there are @xmath4 per gyr in case @xmath190 for a milky way nucleus ) .",
    "we conclude that the apparently inocuous and tiny change of the logarithmic slope from @xmath194 to @xmath195 can have a substantial effect ( a factor of @xmath2 ) on the expected emri rate .",
    "* figure 5 .",
    "* emri rates as a function of mbh mass in strongly segregated nuclei .",
    "the emri rate depends on the mbh mass , @xmath196 . shown are curves for @xmath190 ( @xmath176 and @xmath197 ) and three different mass ratios between heavy and light stars , @xmath56 and @xmath175 .",
    "figure 5 shows the dependence of the intrinsic emri rate on the mass of the central mbh , where the validity of the @xmath198 relation was assumed @xcite .",
    "we see that the emri rate for stellar bhs scales as @xmath199 , independently of @xmath114 and @xmath154 .",
    "its absolute normalization depends obviously on the number fraction @xmath154 of sbhs , in agreement with figures @xmath18 and @xmath20 .",
    "one can make a rough conversion of the estimated intrinsic rate into lisa detection rates .",
    "following @xcite , who made a number of assumptions regarding the local density of mbhs and its spin distribution , plus on the lisa detection capabilities , we find that according to its equation ( @xmath200 ) , lisa will see around @xmath5 emri events during a @xmath6-year or @xmath7-year mission , respectively .",
    "note that these rates may change by factors of @xmath201 as a function of corrections to the local mbh mass density @xcite ; moreover , the uncertainties regarding the efficiency of rr and other channels may still affect the rate predictions by one or two orders of magnitude .",
    "a lot of work still remains to be done ; nevertheless , the consequences regarding the sms regime are significant and under control .",
    "we have considered simplified stellar models of galactic nuclei , with only two mass components , which harbor mbhs that fall into the lisa detection bandwidth . for quite generic initial conditions ,",
    "such stellar clusters are expected to have reached a relaxed , mass segregated , steady state which is independent of initial conditions at the time of formation .",
    "strong ( realistic ) mass segregation is a robust outcome from the growth and evolution of stellar cusps around mbhs in the mass range @xmath202 to which lisa will be sensitive .",
    "our n - body results validate the fokker - planck description of the _ bulk _ properties of the stellar distribution .",
    "sms boosts the emri event rates with respect to what would be implied by a shallower stellar density profile ( _ e.g. _ @xmath27 , which has been the working assumption of almost all event rate estimates in the literature so far ) that also respect the mass normalization obtained from observations of the galactic center at @xmath107 pc from the hole . in particular , our fiducial models of the galactic center are enhanced by a factor of @xmath2leading to a predicted value of @xmath4 stellar bh emris per gyr .",
    "the fp formalism assumes two - body relaxation as the only dynamical driver present  this could be a severe restriction at radii @xmath203 , inside which even the nb simulations with higher @xmath17 in our sample start to run out of particles and where rr could play an important role @xcite .",
    "other crucial mechanisms are resonant relaxation , ( small ) triaxiality of the galactic potential , tidal separation of binaries and massive perturbers ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "these are the subject of our current research work , and the extent to which they can significantly affect the emri rates is still an open question .",

    "<S> the event rate of this kind of source has been addressed many times in the literature and the numbers reported fluctuate by orders of magnitude . on the other hand , recent observations of the galactic center revealed a dearth of giant stars inside the inner parsec relative to the numbers theoretically expected for a fully relaxed stellar cusp . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of unrelaxed nuclei ( or , equivalently , with no or only a very shallow cusp , or core ) adds substantial uncertainty to the estimates . having this timely question in mind </S>",
    "<S> , we run a significant number of direct - summation @xmath0body simulations with up to half a million particles to calibrate a much faster orbit - averaged fokker - planck code . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , under quite generic initial conditions , the time required for the growth of a relaxed , mass segregated stellar cusp is shorter than a hubble time for mbhs with @xmath1 ( i.e. nuclei in the range of _ lisa _ ) . </S>",
