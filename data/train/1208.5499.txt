    "the formation and evolution of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , the sites where stars form , are thought to be influenced by the local properties of the environment and global galactic structure ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although the internal physical properties of molecular clouds have been extensively studied ( @xcite ; henceforth s87 ) , a more detailed understanding of their origin and evolution in different types of environments is needed .",
    "maps with resolution matched to the scale of individual clouds are the key to achieve this goal ; however , such maps currently exist only for a few galaxies outside the local group . due to the coupled evolution between gmcs and their host galaxies , achieving a more complete understanding of molecular cloud formation and evolution",
    "processes represents a key goal for studies of galaxy evolution .",
    "while several mechanisms have been proposed , the predominant mode for molecular cloud formation and evolution in spiral galaxies is not yet clear . in terms of the arm structure",
    ", spiral galaxies can be classified as _ grand - design _",
    ", most of them consisting of two symmetrical spiral arms ; _ multi - armed _ , which show several non - symmetrical arms ; or _ flocculent _ galaxies with multiple shorter arms . for grand - design galaxies ,",
    "the spiral structure is generated by density waves induced by bars or companion galaxies .",
    "the influence of the density waves in the ism in these galaxies has been commonly modeled assuming a long lived , rigidly rotating spiral potential ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , flocculent and multi - armed galaxies",
    "are thought to develop from local gravitational instabilities , although flocculent galaxies can present weak density waves as well ( @xcite ) . in this case ,",
    "numerical simulations model the galactic potential as time dependent structures , which can change on a timescale of @xmath10100 myr ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the formation of massive molecular clouds in grand - design galaxies is attributed to the passing of spiral density waves .",
    "a particular feature of this type of galaxy is the formation of spurs perpendicular to the spiral arms due to the shearing of the molecular structures as they leave the arms ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in their study of the northeastern spiral segment of ic 342 , a grand design galaxy ,",
    "@xcite showed that actively star forming gmcs are more massive , have smaller velocity dispersions and are more gravitationally bound than quiescent gmcs .",
    "they interpreted the tendency for the star - forming gmcs to lie downstream with respect to the quiescent molecular clouds as evidence in favor of cloud a coalescence scenario , where massive molecular clouds ( @xmath11 ) are formed from coagulation of smaller clouds entering the spiral arms , and the star formation is ignited once the excess kinetic energy is dissipated through inelastic collisions of the clouds ( hirota et al .",
    "2011 ) . in another grand design galaxy ,",
    "m51 , @xcite suggested that evolution of gmcs is driven by large scale galactic dynamics , where the most massive molecular complexes ( giant molecular associations , gmas ) are created by coagulation of gmcs in spiral arms .",
    "as gmas leave the arms , they suffer fragmentation by the strong shear motions , which would explain the spur structures observed extending from the arms into the inter - arm regions .",
    "the remaining fragmented gmcs are not disassociated into atomic gas , and they become part of the molecular cloud population observed in inter - arm regions which survive until the passage of another spiral arm .    on the other hand , @xcite presented a numerical simulation of flocculent galaxies .",
    "they find that the gaseous spiral structure essentially traces the potential minimum , in contrast to the case of grand - design spirals where an offset between the spiral shock and the potential minimum is expected .",
    "according to the simulations provided by @xcite and @xcite the most massive structures are thought to be produced in regions where collision or merging between spiral arms can occur , yielding an enhanced star formation in those overdense regions , in contrast to the situation proposed for grand - design galaxies where the molecular clouds are formed by agglomeration within spiral arms .",
    "conversely , the formation of inter - arm molecular gas structures are proposed to be the result of local instabilities rather than fragmentation of gma s , and the properties of the clouds are approximately similar across the disk , with no offsets between gas and star formation expected .",
    "high resolution observations of flocculent galaxies have provided evidence in support of this picture .",
    "for instance , @xcite mapped @xmath0 over the southern arm of the flocculent galaxy ngc 5055 .",
    "they found no obvious offset between h@xmath12 and the molecular gas , and that on - arm and inter - arm clouds do not have significant differences in their properties .",
    "resolved gmcs in the milky way have been shown to be in approximate virial equilibrium obeying scaling relations known as larson s laws ( @xcite ) .",
    "these laws establish that velocity dispersion ( or line width ) , size , and luminosity are correlated in the milky way gmcs .",
    "the size - line width relation may reflect turbulent conditions in the molecular ism .",
    "the typical gmc temperature of 1525 k produces thermal co velocity dispersions of only @xmath100.1 @xmath13 , providing evidence of non - thermal supersonic turbulence within the clouds .",
    "nevertheless , whether the turbulence in the molecular ism is internally or externally generated is still unclear (;",
    "the other two larson relations are the luminosity - line width and the luminosity - size relations . in a recent work , @xcite ( henceforth b08 ) present a study of resolved properties of gmcs for a sample of dwarf galaxies along with two disk galaxies of the local group .",
    "they find insignificant differences between milky way gmcs and gmcs in dwarf galaxies , with the latter following approximately the same larson relations as galactic clouds .",
    "@xcite arrived at a similar conclusion by analyzing observations of co surveys for galaxies in the local group .    due to sensitivity and resolution limitations , observations of resolved properties of gmcs in galaxies",
    "other than milky way are in an early stage ( @xcite , hereafter dm12 ; @xcite ) .",
    "only a few galaxies have been mapped in co emission across the full extent of the optical disk with sufficient resolution to probe the @xmath10100 pc size scales on which gmcs form .",
    "high resolution co surveys ( @xcite ; @xcite ) have focused primarily on the central regions , whereas complete mapping using single - dish telescopes ( @xcite ; @xcite ) has been obtained at resolutions of 11@xmath14 to 15@xmath14 , corresponding to @xmath10500 pc for nearby spirals , inadequate to resolve gmcs . only for m33 ( bima survey ) and the magellanic clouds ( nanten surveys )",
    "has it been possible to conduct a fairly complete census of gmcs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    using a combination of @xmath0 and @xmath1 and pursuing a staged approach of starting with large - scale , low resolution maps and following up with high resolution imaging on smaller areas",
    ", carma makes it possible to study the overall distribution of gmcs , as well as the properties of individual gmcs , in galaxies outside the local group .",
    "we have successfully used this observational strategy in the nearby spiral galaxy ngc 6946 . as indicated by the single - dish co map from iram ( @xcite ) ,",
    "this galaxy is extremely rich in molecular gas , with co emission extended to a large fraction of the optical radius .",
    "table [ n6946-prop ] shows the basic parameters of ngc 6946 .",
    "we have chosen ngc 6946 as our target because of its proximity , high co surface brightness , low inclination , and the availability of high - quality datasets at a variety of wavelengths , including hi imaging from things and multiband spitzer imaging from sings ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spiral structure in ngc 6946 appears complex , with k - band images revealing four prominent , asymmetric spiral arms ( @xcite ) .",
    "while the central region of the galaxy has been well - studied in co because of its high co surface brightness ( @xcite ; @xcite ; dm12 ) , the eastern region has not been mapped at high resolution .    in this paper",
    "we present observations of the eastern region of ngc 6946 .",
    "firstly , we made observations of @xmath0 using carma covering a region of size 6@xmath66 kpc@xmath15 .",
    "the angular resolution for the @xmath0 map was @xmath10110 pc , which is not sufficient to resolve structures with size scales similar to gmcs ( s87 ; b08 ) .",
    "then , the second step was to make higher resolution @xmath1 observations ( @xmath10 50 pc ) towards the brightest co complexes to study the properties of individual gmcs .",
    "we present our study as follows : in section [ obs ] we describe our observations of ngc 6946 using carma , and we describe the archival data at several wavelengths that we include in our analysis . in section [ cprops ] we summarize the technique used to identify gmcs and to measure their physical properties . in section [ cl - prop ] we present the scaling relations of the cloud properties , and we compare them with previous studies of galactic and extragalactic clouds . in section [ env - eff ]",

    "@xcite recommend correcting for resolution bias as well , which can be significant for extragalactic observations .",
    "we correct for the effect of finite spatial and spectral resolution by subtracting in quadrature the beam size and the spectral channel profile from the extrapolated measurements of size and velocity width respectively .",

    "on the other hand , the mean of @xmath73 for @xmath1 clouds was 0.81 , with a variance of 0.02 .",

    "a complete description of the sizes and orientations of the clouds in three dimensions is preferable ( e.g.  @xcite ) , but that information is not available for observational data . in particular , a correction for inclination can be only applied statistically , and not for individual clouds .",
    "thus , we assume here that the clouds can be fully described by the sky - projected major and minor axes .",
    "we make the further assumption that the axis of symmetry is given by the major axis of the clouds , and the clouds are prolate .",
    "the correction for the shape of the cloud can strongly affect the virial mass estimates for structures that present a large axis ratio . because we assume elongation in the plane of the sky ,",
    "a structure elongated along the line of sight will appear roughly circular , and our correction will be inappropriate . nevertheless , given the sizes found in this regions ( @xmath10 50 - 150 pc ) , and the usual thickness of the molecular gas disk in galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite find molecular gas thickness @xmath10200 pc for ngc 891 ) , it is likely that the axes of symmetry of the clouds are directed along the disk , reducing the overcorrection we may be applying to our estimates . supporting this assumption , @xcite have provided observational evidence that molecular clouds are elongated along the galactic plane .",
    "we followed the definition of the dimensionless virial parameter @xmath81 given by @xcite ,    @xmath82    which measures the relative importance of the cloud s kinetic energy compared to its gravitational energy .",
    "this parameter is usually used to investigate whether the clouds are in virial equilibrium , @xmath83 ; for @xmath84 the self - gravity is not important , and the clouds are confined due to an external pressure if the clouds are assumed to be in steady state .",
    "the uncertainties assessed to the moment measurements ( and thus to the physical quantities and their derivatives ) are estimated using bootstrapping methods , and this is the only source of uncertainties that we include in our analysis .      additionally , we have used the @xmath2 line map to calculate lte masses over the regions with significant emission . if we assume that all energy levels are populated according to local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) at the temperature @xmath85 , the column density of the @xmath86 molecule in terms of the opacity of the @xmath87 transition is given by ( e. g. , @xcite )    @xmath88    where @xmath8 is in @xmath13 .",
    "in this study we have determined the excitation temperature by using the assumed optically thick line @xmath0    @xmath89    and assuming a filling factor of unity .",
    "the mean of @xmath85 is 4.2 k considering the regions of significant emission in the @xmath0 map , while this mean increases to 5 k when considering the @xmath2 regions of detectable emission . in section [ mvir - lum ]",
    "we will investigate the effect of using higher values of @xmath85 in the lte mass estimates .",
    "the optical depth of the @xmath2 line is given by    @xmath90.\\ ] ]    by assuming that @xmath2 line is optically thin , the total molecular mass can be computed using an appropriate abundance ratio ,    @xmath91 d^2 \\int{n(^{13}\\mathrm{co})\\mathrm{d}\\omega}\\ ] ]    where @xmath92 is the mean molecular mass per h@xmath62 molecule , @xmath58 is the distance , and @xmath93 $ ] is the abundance ratio . in this study",
    "we have assumed the abundance ratio to be @xmath94 .",
    "this value is close to the ratio given by the relation found by @xcite , which yields @xmath95\\sim 60 $ ] for @xmath96 kpc , and assuming a @xmath97 abundance ratio of 1.1 @xmath98 ( @xcite ) .",
    "another important cloud property is the mass surface density .",
    "surface density has been estimated by dividing the luminosity - based mass by the corresponding area covered by the @xmath1 cloud ( or @xmath0 complex ) , thus @xmath99 .",
    "in general the areas for @xmath1 clouds are smaller than @xmath0 complexes .",
    "the fluxes and areas involved in these calculations are the non - extrapolated values .",
    "we have made this choice , because we intend to compare molecular gas surface density with other tracers ( hi , 24@xmath9 m , h@xmath12 , fuv ) over the boundary of the clouds given by the mask provided by cprops .",
    "because we do not have extrapolated or deconvolved measurements of the fluxes for these tracers , we have used the raw properties of the clouds .      in this paper , we have estimated the star formation rate ( sfr ) using fuv , 24@xmath9 m and h@xmath12 images described in section [ obs ] .",
    "the method to estimate the star formation activity is different for @xmath0 complexes and @xmath1 clouds , mainly due to the limiting spatial resolution of the sfr tracer images .",
    "the details of the calculations are given below .",
    "following the approach given by l08 , we estimate the star formation rate surface density in @xmath0 complexes using _ galex _ fuv and _ spitzer _ 24 @xmath9 m maps . by tracing photospheric emission of o and b stars , fuv emission measures unobscured star formation over time scales of 10 - 100 myr ( @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", 24 @xmath9 m traces the small dust grains heated by uv photons radiated from young stars , thereby tracing obscured star formation over time scales of @xmath1010 myr ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the use of 24 @xmath9 m as tracer of obscured star formation was analyzed by @xcite .",
    "they showed that the combination of h@xmath12 ( unobscured sfr ) and 24@xmath9 m ( obscured ) recovers the total sfr , which they estimated by using paschen-@xmath12 ( pa@xmath12 ) emission as a tracer of ionizing photons unaffected by extinction .",
    "l08 used a similar prescription to derive the total sfr , but using fuv maps instead of h@xmath12 to trace unobscured sfr .",
    "they found that the total star formation surface density @xmath100 can be estimated by :    @xmath101    where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are in units of mjy / sr .",
    "the coarse resolution of the 24@xmath9 m map ( @xmath39 ) does not permit us to use the sfr from equation ( [ sfr ] ) to perform a direct comparison between star - forming regions and the structures identified in @xmath1 .",
    "we therefore use the h@xmath12 image to estimate the amount of star formation in @xmath1 clouds .",
    "however , h@xmath12 emission can be strongly affected by dust extinction , and a correction should be applied to h@xmath12-based sfr estimates to account for embedded star formation .",
    "following @xcite , the star formation surface density can be estimated by    @xmath104    where @xmath105 is in units of ergs s@xmath30 , and @xmath106 is the h@xmath12 extinction . in the section [ sfr - result ] , we will show that applying a @xmath107 mag roughly recovers the total star formation as traced by fuv+24@xmath9 m .",
    "although the cprops method corrects for sensitivity and resolution bias , those corrections can introduce some additional scatter in the cloud property scaling relations .",
    "therefore , we will start this section by showing the scaling relations without any correction to assess overall correlation strengths .",
    "we have identified 45 complexes in the @xmath0 channel map .",
    "the mean uncorrected radius of the @xmath0 clouds is 128.5 @xmath108 3.1 pc , and the mean uncorrected line width is 4.2 @xmath108 0.1 @xmath13 . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean uncorrected luminosity of these complexes is ( 8.6 @xmath108 0.1 ) @xmath109 @xmath110 , which corresponds to a mean luminosity - based mass of 3.8 @xmath108 0.05 @xmath111 . figure [ fig_co10_siwi_raw ] shows the scaling relations for the raw properties .",
    "we selected the 11 most massive @xmath0 complexes to make follow - up observations with @xmath1 , and they are shown in figure [ figure_ngc6946e_13co ] .",
    "we identified 64 giant molecular clouds in the regions observed , and their scaling relations are shown in figure [ fig_co10_siwi_raw ] as well .",
    "for this set of clouds , the mean radius is 54.9 @xmath108 1.1 pc , the mean line width is 3.7 @xmath108 0.1 @xmath13 , the mean luminosity is ( 2.4 @xmath108 0.03 ) @xmath6 @xmath112 , and the mean luminosity - based mass is ( 1.04 @xmath108 0.01)@xmath6 @xmath113 .",
    ".spearman rank correlation coefficient @xmath114 for both raw and bias corrected relations.[table - rank ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the other region with high sfe ( region 6 in figure [ figure_ngc6946e_13co ] ) , on the other hand , does not present such a high velocity gradient as the region discussed above .",
    "however , we observe a @xmath1015 @xmath13 difference in velocity between region 6 and the regions located to the north - west and to the south - east . while those regions surrounding the molecular gas complex in region 6 are moving more or less at @xmath115 @xmath13 with respect to the rotating frame , region 6 is moving in the other direction with a velocity of @xmath1010 @xmath13 .",
    "this difference in velocity can be observed clearly in the position - velocity diagram shown in the right panel of figure [ figure_pv ] .",
    "this may imply that the gas actively forming stars in region 6 could be the result of a recent convergence of flows .",
    "although we do not observe signatures of a merging or collision process of spiral arms in the gas distribution near region 6 , it is possible that the process had already formed a new spiral arm , obscuring the original arm locations .",
    "more detailed analysis of the kinematics of the gas is required to disentangle the actual process involved in the enhancement of star formation efficiency in region 6 .",
    "c      the study presented here can be improved in multiple ways .",
    "our analysis has been limited to the north - eastern area of the molecular gas disk of ngc 6946 for @xmath0 observations , and to some of the brightest regions for @xmath1 follow - up observations .",
    "a full census of the gmcs population across the disk is needed in order to perform a detailed study of molecular cloud properties and their relation with the surrounding environment .",
    "nevertheless , high sensitivity maps with resolutions @xmath116 pc remain observationally challenging to obtain , although recent studies have achieved this goal with carma+nro 45 m ( e.g. dm12 ) .",
    "new facilities like alma will provide maps of unprecedented quality , allowing us to perform an unbiased analysis of the molecular gas in nearby galaxies at scales close to gmc sizes .    in our sfr calculations for @xmath1 clouds ,",
    "we have applied a crude global extinction correction a@xmath117 mag to the sfr(h@xmath12 ) .",
    "although we showed that such correction is a good approximation to the sfr values found using a combination of fuv+24@xmath9 m for @xmath0 complexes , a more sophisticated approach to calculate the obscured sfr at resolution close to the gmcs sizes is needed .",
    "thus , tracers relatively unaffected by dust absorption represent a valuable alternative to estimate the total sfr at smaller scales . in this direction , observations of paschen @xmath12 ( p@xmath12 )",
    "line could provide unbiased measurements of the number of ionizing photons in these star forming regions ( @xcite ) .",
    "equations [ sfr ] and [ sfr_ha ] assume that stars have been formed continuously .",
    "nevertheless , this assumption may not be longer valid for scales close to gmc sizes , as one approaches the case of a single stellar population with a discrete age .",
    "some studies have investigated the uncertainty in using a linear conversion from uv or h@xmath12 luminosity to estimate the sfr , making use of models assuming an instantaneous burst of star formation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed that while h@xmath12 emission occurs mostly in the first 10 myr , fuv presents low , but significant , emission up to 65 myr after the burst .",
    "they report a factor of 2 uncertainty inferring the sfr from h@xmath12 , and a factor 3 - 4 uncertainty inferring sfr from fuv .",
    "resolved star cluster observations in the regions observed in this study could shed light on the ages involved , and provide an independent way to estimate the star formation rate which can be compared to the sfr traced by fuv or h@xmath12 .",
    "we have performed one of the most detailed observations of gmcs outside the milky way . using carma ,",
    "we have observed @xmath0 and @xmath2 over the northeastern disk of the non - grand design galaxy ngc 6946 , covering a region of 6@xmath66 kpc@xmath15 at a resolution of @xmath10110 pc .",
    "although at this resolution it is possible to resolve some of the largest molecular clouds , we have complemented this map with higher ( @xmath1050 pc ) resolution maps of @xmath1 towards the brightest regions observed in @xmath0 .",
    "the extended flux has been recovered by merging our interferometric maps from carma with single dish maps from nro 45 m and iram 30 m .",
    "the results are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we have estimated the properties of the molecular gas structures ( size , line width and flux ) using the cloud - finding algorithm cprops ( section [ cl - prop ] ) .",
    "we have resolved the largest molecular complexes into several structures . at the resolution offered by @xmath0 observations ,",
    "we have identified 45 co emitting complexes with typical sizes of @xmath10150 pc .",
    "five of these complexes show significant @xmath2 emission , which appear to be regions of denser gas .",
    "the higher resolution observations of @xmath1 towards the brightest regions detected in @xmath0 allowed us to find 64 structures which we have identified as gmcs .",
    "2 .   in section [ cl - prop - corr ]",
    "we observed that the properties of the clouds and complexes follow relations similar to those found previously for extragalactic clouds ( figure [ figure_line - width ] ) .",
    "in particular , the trends defined by the @xmath0 complexes presented in this paper are consistent with those found in the center of ngc 6946 by dm12 , despite the differences in resolution and cloud identification algorithms ; the exception is the set of gmcs located within 400 pc of the galactic center with large velocity dispersions ( > 10 @xmath13 ) .",
    "additionally , our @xmath118-@xmath56 relation is located slightly above the relation found by dm12 for the central part of ngc 6946 and is consistent with our choice of the co to h@xmath62 conversion factor @xmath61=@xmath119 .",
    "we have estimated lte masses for the regions with significant @xmath2 emission ( figure [ figure_13co ] ) .",
    "although the lte masses are smaller by a factor of 2 than the luminosity - based masses in our sample of clouds , this discrepancy does not necessarily mean that @xmath0 intensities are not suitable to estimate true molecular cloud masses , but may reflect systematic errors arising from our lack of knowledge of the excitation temperature and co abundance , both needed to infer masses from @xmath2 emission .",
    "the star formation rates of the @xmath0 complexes were estimated in section [ sfr - result ] using multiband _",
    "imaging from sings and fuv galex maps of ngc 6946 . in figure [ figure_sfr ]",
    "we observe a clear correlation between sfr surface density ( @xmath100 ) and molecular gas surface density ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "the bisector linear regression for the relation @xmath121 yields a slope of @xmath122 for the @xmath0 emitting complexes , which is steeper than the value found by previous work ( @xmath123 , @xcite ) . in order to detect faint co complexes , but with active star formation , we have observed with higher sensitivity the @xmath0 line over a smaller region located beyond the spiral arms , where atomic gas is comparable ( or dominant ) to the molecular gas ( figure [ figure_mom0_e ] ) .",
    "we interpret these co - faint star forming regions as isolated structures that could have departed from the main spiral arms , and have been turning their molecular gas into stars since then .",
    "thus , it is not surprising to find atomic gas peaks in these regions , which could have been produced by photodissociated molecular gas .",
    "higher sensitivity observations are necessary to detect faint molecular gas associated with such late stage star formation .",
    "5 .   for gmcs identified in the @xmath1 maps",
    ", we estimate their sfr using h@xmath12 maps . we have found a steeper slope than the values found for @xmath0 complexes , with @xmath124 .",
    "we observe that galactic massive dense clumps follow a rough extrapolation of the @xmath100-@xmath120 relation for these @xmath1 gmcs to higher gas surface densities ( figure [ figure_sfr_heid ] ) .",
    "alma will observe the molecular gas distribution at even higher resolution and sensitivity , allowing a direct comparison between the galactic and extragalactic @xmath100-@xmath120 relations at similar scales .",
    "6 .   in section [ in - on - arm ] , on - arm and inter - arm regions have been defined based on stellar mass density enhancements traced by the 3.6 @xmath9 m image of ngc 6946 ( figure [ figure_four ] ) .",
    "the complexes and gmcs were classified as on - arm and inter - arm structures accordingly .",
    "although we observe that cloud properties have similar values independent of location in the disk , a small number of clouds are more massive , present broader line widths , and higher star formation rate than the remaining sample of clouds ( figure [ figure_arm10 ] ) .",
    "we found that these structures appear to be located at two specific regions in the spiral arms ( region 6 - 7 and region 11 in figure [ figure_ngc6946e_13co ] ) .",
    "7 .   the star formation efficiency ( sfe , defined as",
    "the ratio between @xmath100 and @xmath120 ) is roughly flat over the region observed , with values between @xmath125 and @xmath126 myr@xmath30 ( section [ rad - prop ] , figure [ figure_rad_sfr ] ) .",
    "however , the sfe is enhanced in the regions where we observed more massive and more luminous gmcs ( see figure [ figure_map_sfe ] and table [ table - high - cld ] ) .",
    "the velocity field of the molecular gas reveals irregular non - circular motion with values below 15 @xmath13 with respect to the rotating frame ( figure [ figure_mom1_e ] ) .",
    "in addition , we found some evidence for convergence of gas flows in one of the regions of high sfe ( figure [ figure_pv ] ) .",
    "the other region presenting sfe peaks does not show such a strong velocity gradient .",
    "however , this region shows a 15 @xmath13 difference with respect to the surrounding molecular gas , which could be caused by a previous convergence of gas flow .",
    "although a more detailed comparison with simulations is needed in order to have a more conclusive picture of the role of gas dynamics in the formation of gmcs and stars in these type of galaxies , these new observations suggest that , in agreement with numerical simulations of non - grand design spiral galaxies , the convergence of gas flows into the spiral arm , and collisions or merging of arms may increase the local gas density to higher values than the mean observed in the disk , creating more massive molecular clouds , and enhancing the rate of star formation .",

    "<S> we present high spatial resolution observations of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) in the eastern part of the nearby spiral galaxy ngc 6946 obtained with the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have observed @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , achieving spatial resolutions of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively over a region of 6 @xmath6 6 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> this region extends from 1.5 kpc to 8 kpc galactocentric radius , thus avoiding the intense star formation in the central kpc . </S>",
    "<S> we have recovered short - spacing @xmath7-@xmath8 components by using single dish observations from the nobeyama 45 m and iram 30 m telescopes . using the automated cprops algorithm we identified 45 co cloud complexes in the @xmath0 map and 64 gmcs in the @xmath1 maps . </S>",
    "<S> the sizes , line widths , and luminosities of the gmcs are similar to values found in other extragalactic studies . </S>",
    "<S> we have classified the clouds into on - arm and inter - arm clouds based on the stellar mass density traced by the 3.6 @xmath9 m map . </S>",
    "<S> clouds located on - arm present in general higher star formation rates than clouds located in inter - arm regions . although the star formation efficiency shows no systematic trend with galactocentric radius , some on - arm clouds  which are more luminous and more massive compared to inter - arm gmcs  are also forming stars more efficiently than the rest of the identified gmcs . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these structures appear to be located in two specific regions in the spiral arms . </S>",
    "<S> one of them shows a strong velocity gradient , suggesting that this region of high star formation efficiency may be the result of gas flow convergence . </S>"
