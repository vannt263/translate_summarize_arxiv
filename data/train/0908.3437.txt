    "in this paper , we study the following hypothesis testing problem introduced by @xcite .",
    "one observes an @xmath0-dimensional vector @xmath1 .",
    "the null hypothesis @xmath2 is that the components of @xmath3 are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "standard normal random variables .",
    "we denote the probability measure and expectation under @xmath2 by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .    to describe the alternative hypothesis @xmath6 , consider a class @xmath7 of @xmath8 sets of indices such that @xmath9 for all @xmath10 .",
    "under @xmath6 , there exists an @xmath11 such that @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a positive parameter .",
    "the components of @xmath3 are independent under @xmath6 as well .",
    "the probability measure of @xmath3 defined this way by an @xmath11 is denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "similarly , we write @xmath15 for the expectation with respect to @xmath14 . throughout , we will assume that every @xmath11 has the same cardinality @xmath16 .",
    "a test is a binary - valued function @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath18 then we say that the test accepts the null hypothesis , otherwise @xmath2 is rejected .",
    "one would like to design tests such that @xmath2 is accepted with a large probability when @xmath3 is distributed according to @xmath4 and it is rejected when the distribution of @xmath3 is @xmath14 for some @xmath19 . following @xcite , we consider the risk of a test @xmath20 measured by @xmath21 this measure of risk corresponds to the view that , under the alternative hypothesis , a set @xmath22 is selected uniformly at random and the components of @xmath3 belonging to @xmath23 have mean @xmath24 . in the sequel , we refer to the first and second terms on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : bayes_risk ] ) as the type i and type ii errors , respectively .",
    "we are interested in determining , or at least estimating the value of @xmath24 under which the risk can be made small .",
    "our aim is to understand the order of magnitude , when @xmath0 is large , as a function of @xmath0 , @xmath25 , and the structure of @xmath26 , of the value of the smallest @xmath24 for which risk can be made small .",
    "the value of @xmath24 for which the risk of the best possible test equals @xmath27 is called _ critical_.    typically , the @xmath0 components of @xmath3 represent weights over the @xmath0 edges of a given graph @xmath28 and each @xmath11 is a subgraph of @xmath28 .",
    "when @xmath29 then the edge @xmath30 is `` contaminated '' and we wish to test whether there is a subgraph in @xmath26 that is entirely contaminated .    in @xcite , two examples were studied in detail . in one case",
    ", @xmath26 contains all paths between two given vertices in a two - dimensional grid and in the other @xmath26 is the set of paths from root to a leaf in a complete binary tree . in both cases ,",
    "the order of magnitude of the critical value of @xmath24 was determined .",
    "@xcite investigate another class of examples in which elements of @xmath26 correspond to clusters in a regular grid .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite describe numerous practical applications of problems of this type .",
    "some other interesting examples are when @xmath26 is :    * the set of all subsets @xmath31 of size @xmath25 ; * the set of all cliques of a given size in a complete graph ; * the set of all bicliques ( i.e. , complete bipartite subgraphs ) of a given size in a complete bipartite graph ; * the set of all spanning trees of a complete graph ; * the set of all perfect matchings in a complete bipartite graph ; * the set of all sub - cubes of a given size of a binary hypercube .",
    "the first of these examples , which lacks any combinatorial structure , has been studied in the rich literature on multiple testing ; see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein .    as pointed out in @xcite , regardless of what @xmath26 is",
    ", one may determine explicitly the test @xmath32 minimizing the risk .",
    "it follows from basic results of binary classification that for a given vector @xmath33 , @xmath34 , if and only if the ratio of the likelihoods of @xmath35 under @xmath36 and @xmath4 exceeds @xmath37 . writing @xmath38 and @xmath39 for the probability densities of @xmath4 and @xmath14 , respectively , the likelihood ratio at @xmath35 is @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the optimal test is given by @xmath42 the risk of @xmath32 ( often called the bayes risk ) may then be written as @xmath43 we are interested in the behavior of @xmath44 as a function of @xmath26 and @xmath24 .",
    "clearly , @xmath44 is a monotone decreasing function of @xmath24 .",
    "( this fact is intuitively clear and can be proved easily by differentiating @xmath44 with respect to @xmath24 . ) for @xmath24 sufficiently large , @xmath44 is close to zero while for very small values of @xmath24 , @xmath44 is near its maximum value  @xmath37 , indicating that testing is virtually impossible .",
    "our aim is to understand for what values of @xmath24 the transition occurs .",
    "this depends on the combinatorial and geometric structure of the class @xmath26 .",
    "we describe various general conditions in both directions and illustrate them on examples .",
    "@xcite also consider the risk measure @xmath45 clearly , @xmath46 and when there is sufficient symmetry in @xmath20 and @xmath26 , we have equality .",
    "however , there are significant differences between the two measures of risk .",
    "the alternative measure @xmath47 obviously satisfies the following monotonicity property : for a class @xmath26 and parameter @xmath13 , let @xmath48 denote the smallest achievable risk . if @xmath49 are two classes then for any @xmath24 , @xmath50 .",
    "in contrast to this , the `` bayesian '' risk measure @xmath51 does not satisfy such a monotonicity property as is shown in section [ nonmonotone ] . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the risk measure @xmath51 .    throughout the paper we assume , for simplicity , that each set @xmath19 has the same cardinality @xmath25 .",
    "we do this partly in order to avoid technicalities that are not difficult but make the arguments less transparent . at the same time , in many natural examples this condition is satisfied . if @xmath26 may contain sets of different size such that all sets have approximately the same number of elements , then all arguments go through without essential changes . however , if @xmath26 contains sets of very different size then the picture may change because large sets become much easier to detect and small sets can basically be ignored .",
    "another approach to handle sets of different size , adopted by @xcite , is to change the model of the alternative hypothesis such that the level @xmath24 of contamination is appropriately scaled depending on the size of the set @xmath23 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ simpletests ] , we briefly discuss two suboptimal but simple and general testing rules ( the _ maximum test _ and the _ averaging test _ ) that imply sufficient conditions for testability that turn out to be useful in many examples .    in section [ lowerbounds ] ,",
    "a few general sufficient conditions are derived for the impossibility of testing under symmetry assumptions for the class .    in section",
    "[ examples ] , we work out several concrete examples , including the class of all @xmath25-sets , the class of all cliques of a certain size in a complete graph , the class of all perfect matchings in the complete bipartite graph and the class of all spanning trees in a complete graph . in section [ nonmonotone ] ,",
    "we show that , perhaps surprisingly , the optimal risk is not monotone in the sense that larger classes may be significantly easier to test than small ones , though monotonicity holds under certain symmetry conditions .    in the last two sections of the paper , we use techniques developed in the theory of gaussian processes to establish upper and lower bounds related to geometrical properties of the class @xmath26 . in section",
    "[ hellinger ] , general lower bounds are derived in terms of random subclasses and metric entropies of the class @xmath26 .",
    "finally , in section [ typeone ] we take a closer look at the type i error of the optimal test and prove an upper bound that , in certain situations , is significantly tighter than the natural bound obtained for a general - purpose maximum test .",
    "as mentioned in the , the test @xmath32 minimizing the risk is explicitly determined .",
    "however , the performance of this test is not always easy to analyze . moreover ,",
    "efficient computation of the optimal test is often a nontrivial problem though efficient algorithms are available in many interesting cases .",
    "( we discuss computational issues for the examples of section [ examples ] . ) because of these reasons , it is often useful to consider simpler , though suboptimal , tests . in this section ,",
    "we briefly discuss two simplistic tests , a test based on averaging and a test based on maxima .",
    "these are often easier to analyze and help understand the behavior of the optimal test as well . in many cases ,",
    "one of these tests turn out to have a near - optimal performance .",
    "perhaps the simplest possible test is based on the fact that the sum of the components of @xmath3 is zero - mean normal under @xmath4 and has mean @xmath52 under the alternative hypothesis .",
    "thus , it is natural to consider the _ averaging test _",
    "@xmath53    [ average ]",
    "let @xmath54 .",
    "the risk of the averaging test @xmath20 satisfies @xmath55 whenever @xmath56    observe that under @xmath4 , the statistic @xmath57 has normal @xmath58 distribution while for each @xmath19 , under @xmath14 , it is distributed as @xmath59 .",
    "thus , @xmath60 .",
    "another natural test is based on the fact that under the alternative hypothesis for some @xmath19 , @xmath61 is normal @xmath62 .",
    "consider the _ maximum test _ @xmath63 the test statistic @xmath64 is often referred to as a _ scan statistic _ and has been thoroughly studied for a wide range of applications ; see @xcite . here , we only need the following simple observation .",
    "[ maxtest ] the risk of the maximum test @xmath20 satisfies @xmath55 whenever @xmath65    in the analysis , it is convenient to use the following simple gaussian concentration inequality ; see @xcite .",
    "[ tsirelson ] let @xmath66 be an vector of @xmath0 independent standard normal random variables .",
    "let @xmath67 denote a lipschitz function with lipschitz constant @xmath68 ( with respect to the euclidean distance ) .",
    "then for all @xmath69 , @xmath70    proof of proposition [ maxtest ] simply note that under the null hypothesis , for each @xmath19 , @xmath71 is a zero - mean normally distributed random variable with variance @xmath72 . since @xmath64 is a lipschitz function of @xmath3 with lipschitz constant @xmath73 , by tsirelson s inequality , for all @xmath74 , @xmath75 on the other hand , under @xmath14 for a fixed @xmath19 , @xmath76 and therefore @xmath77 which completes the proof .",
    "the maximum test is often easier to compute than the optimal test @xmath32 , though maximization is not always possible in polynomial time .",
    "if the value of @xmath78 is not exactly known , one may replace it in the definition of @xmath20 by any upper bound and then the same upper bound will appear in the performance bound .",
    "proposition [ maxtest ] shows that the maximum test is guaranteed to work whenever @xmath24 is at least @xmath79 .",
    "thus , in order to better understand the behavior of the maximum test ( and thus obtain sufficient conditions for the optimal test to have a low risk ) , one needs to understand the expected value of @xmath64 ( under @xmath4 ) .",
    "as the maximum of gaussian processes have been studied extensively , there are plenty of directly applicable results available for expected maxima .",
    "the textbook of @xcite is dedicated to this topic . here",
    ", we only recall some of the basic facts .",
    "first , note that one always has @xmath80 but sharper bounds can be derived by chaining arguments ; see @xcite for an elegant and advanced treatment .",
    "the classical chaining bound of @xcite works as follows . introduce a metric on @xmath26 by @xmath81 where @xmath82 denotes the hamming distance . for @xmath74 ,",
    "let @xmath83 denote the @xmath84-covering number of @xmath26 with respect to the metric @xmath85 , that is , the smallest number of open balls of radius @xmath84 that cover @xmath26 .",
    "by dudley s theorem , there exists a numerical constant @xmath86 such that @xmath87 where @xmath88 denotes the diameter of the metric space @xmath26 .",
    "note that since @xmath89 for all @xmath19 , @xmath90 .",
    "dudley s theorem is not optimal but it is relatively easy to use .",
    "dudley s theorem has been refined , based on `` majorizing measures , '' or `` generic chaining '' which gives sharp bounds ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "[ rmk : vc ] in certain cases , it is convenient to further bound dudley s inequality in terms of the vc dimension ; see @xcite .",
    "recall that the vc dimension @xmath91 of @xmath26 is the largest positive integer @xmath92 such that there exists an @xmath92-element set @xmath93 such that for all @xmath94 subsets @xmath95 there exists an @xmath11 such that @xmath96 .",
    "@xcite proved that the covering numbers of @xmath26 may be bounded as @xmath97 so by dudley s bound , @xmath98    an interesting alternative to the maximum test , proposed and investigated by @xcite and @xcite , is based on the idea that under the null hypothesis the distribution of the vector @xmath3 does not change if the sign of each component is changed randomly , while under the alternative hypothesis the distribution changes . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "methods based on symmetrization and bootstrap are suggested and analyzed .",
    "such tests are meaningful and interesting in the setup of the present paper as well and it would be interesting to analyze their behavior .",
    "in this section , we investigate conditions under which the risk of any test is large .",
    "we start with a simple universal bound that implies that regardless of what the class @xmath26 is , small risk can not be achieved unless @xmath24 is substantially large compared to @xmath99 .",
    "an often convenient way of bounding the bayes risk @xmath44 is in terms of the bhattacharyya measure of affinity [ @xcite ] @xmath100 it is well known [ see , e.g. , @xcite , theorem 3.1 ] that @xmath101 thus , @xmath102 essentially behaves as the bayes error in the sense that @xmath44 is near @xmath37 when @xmath102 is near @xmath37 , and is small when @xmath102 is small . observe that , by jensen s inequality , @xmath103 straightforward calculation shows that for any @xmath19 , @xmath104 and therefore we have the following .",
