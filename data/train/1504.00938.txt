    "surface plasmon - polaritons ( spps ) are electromagnetic excitations resulting from the coupling of the incident radiation with collective oscillations of conductive electrons near the interface between metal and dielectric . due to the specific dispersion",
    "the effective wavelength of spps is usually significantly shorter than that of the incident field making spps highly attractive for various applications @xcite .",
    "these range from electromagnetic energy transport at the nanoscale @xcite , nano - focusing @xcite , utilization of plasmons to achieve lasing beyond the diffraction limit @xcite , and many others @xcite .",
    "there is also a growing interest in optics of hybrid nano - materials , structures composed of plasmon - polariton sustaining systems ( such as nanoparticles , one - dimensional and two - dimensional periodic arrays , for instance ) and molecular aggregates @xcite .",
    "the original interest was geared towards electromagnetic energy exchange between semi - classical spps and molecular excitons @xcite occurring on a femtosecond timescale @xcite .",
    "much work has been done to investigate linear optical properties of both propagating @xcite and localized spps @xcite coupled to quantum emitters in the strong coupling regime ( for a comprehensive review of the current state of the field see [ ] ) .",
    "going beyond the linear regime it was recently shown that such systems present an interesting opportunity to actively control light at the nanoscale and manipulate optical properties of nano - materials @xcite .",
    "our major point of interest in this work is to scrutinize electromagnetic properties of molecular aggregates composed of simple two - level emitters strongly coupled to spp waves supported by plasmonic waveguides .",

    ", the manipulation of channel plasmon - polaritons ( cpps ) propagating along metallic v - groove channels has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "the propagation length of cpps was investigated in [ ] by filling the grooves with fluorescent microscopic beads and measuring the propagation length by microscope , and selection of cpp modes can be accomplished by adjusting the shape and size of the groove @xcite .",

    "we now consider the optical response of the system when emitters are added inside the grooves . when the emitters are resonant to the structure , normal mode splitting ( rabi splitting ) is clearly observed ( fig . [ figure3]a ) .",

    "several observations discussed in [ ] suggest that this peak has its origins in spp enhanced emitter - emitter interactions .    to better understand the physics of this resonance we performed simulations gradually varying either groove angle ( fig .",
    "[ figure3]b ) or groove depth ( fig .",
    "[ figure3]c ) .",
    "note that the bare spp lines plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure3]b and [ figure3]c are clearly not linear with groove angle or groove depth ( see below ) .",

    "[ figure3]b and [ figure3]c .",
    "the results clearly indicate avoided crossing - a unique signature of the strong coupling due to efficient energy exchange between the corresponding spp mode and molecular excitons ( in our case these are simply two - level emitters ) .",
    "next , the energy of the intermediate peak ( green triangles in fig .",
    "[ figure3]b and c ) does not deviate appreciably from the emitter resonance even as the spp resonance is tuned .",
    "furthermore , this peak merges with the upper polariton as the thickness of a spacer layer between the grating and emitters increases .",
    "the dipole coupling between the emitters themselves is therefore suspected given the fall - off of this peak as the spp field at the emitters location decreases .",
    "finally , a simulation was run in which the entire region containing emitters was replaced by a single two - level system ( essentially a spatially distributed single emitter with a very large dipole moment ) , thereby eliminating any possible interaction between the emitters . in this case , the third peak disappears even under extremely high coupling conditions .",
    "this confirms earlier findings @xcite which suggested that the intermediate resonance located in the middle of the rabi splitting corresponds to dipole - dipole interactions between emitters greatly enhanced by the spp mode .    the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ figure3]b and [ figure3]c are calculations of the values of the upper and lower polaritons using the coupled oscillator model .",
    "the hamiltonian of the coupled system is @xmath52 @xmath53 is the spp energy of the bare metallic grooves ( obtained from simulations ) , @xmath54 is the transition energy of uncoupled emitters , and @xmath55 is the minimum rabi splitting value .",

    "[ figure3]b , the comparison to the coupled oscillator model is close whereas in fig .",
    "[ figure3]c it deviates somewhat at larger groove depths .",
    "in particular , we note that both the upper and lower polaritons appear to be `` pinched '' toward each other in fig .",
    "[ figure3]c .",
    "we offer two possible explanations for this .",
    "first , a large groove depth requires the incident fields to traverse a larger length of emitters .",
    "more absorption takes place than for a shallower grove , leading to decreased excitation of spp waves near the bottom and therefore less coupling .",
    "second , the third feature may interact with the upper and lower polaritons at greater groove depths in such a way as to reduce the coupling .",
    "optics of periodic v - grooves coupled to quantum emitters .",

    "panel ( b ) shows the upper polariton ( red squares ) , lower polariton ( blue circles ) , and third resonant mode ( green triangles ) as a function of the groove angle to sweep the spp resonance through the emitter resonance .",
    "panel ( c ) shows the same modes as in panel ( b ) but as functions of the groove depth to sweep the spp resonance through the emitter resonance .",
    "the horizontal black lines in panels ( b ) and ( c ) represent the fixed emitter resonance , the curved black lines represent the spp energy of the bare grooves for the given geometry , and the dashed lines are values predicted by the coupled oscillator model .",

    "[ figure4]a . in the `` full '' grooves ,",
    "the region of the grooves occupied by emitters is completely full of emitters up to a given height , whereas in `` hollowed '' grooves , the region of emitters extends out sideways from either side of the groove by a fixed width ( referred to as `` width of emitters '' from here on ) .",
    "the grooves are illuminated with cw fields at @xmath46 ev ( uniform intensity , fig .",
    "[ figure2]b ) or @xmath47 ev ( localized intensity , fig .",
    "[ figure2]c ) .",
    "the rabi splitting is observed as the area occupied by the emitters is varied .",
    "[ figure4]b shows that , for the distributed resonance , there is relatively little difference in rabi splitting when the same amount of area is occupied by the emitters for either full or hollowed grooves , which demonstrates that the entire volume of emitters is indeed coupled to the spp waves .",
    "given that coupling strength depends on field strength , this is reasonable in light of the uniform distribution of intensity in the bare groove at this frequency ; the same rabi splitting is achieved regardless of where a given area of emitters is placed in the groove .",
    "[ figure4]c shows that , for the localized resonance , a large increase in rabi splitting occurs as the area is increased from the bottom , but then it levels off to a constant value well before the emitters reach the top of the groove .",
    "this is exactly what is expected as the strong fields near the bottom of the groove give the strongest coupling .",
    "the constant value of rabi splitting is smaller for the lowest width of emitters ( 10 nm ) and this occurs because the fields above the bottom of the groove are weaker but not zero ( hence a larger hollow region loses some of the emitters coupled to those weaker fields ) .",
    "a small jump occurs at the end of each graph in fig .",
    "[ figure4]c and this is due to the increased fields at the sharp corners of the groove .",
    "this jump occurs at smaller areas for more hollowed grooves as they occupy less area when they extend to the top of the groove .",
    "spatially dependent coupling .",
    "the density of emitters is @xmath59 emitters/@xmath58 , the transition energy is @xmath46 ev , and the pure dephasing time is @xmath43 fs . as the height of the molecular aggregate is increased , the coupling for the distributed resonance increases continuously whereas that for the localized resonance levels off quickly .",

    "[ figure5]a shows rabi splitting as a function of pump amplitude at the end of the pump .",
    "[ figure5]b shows the ground state population , averaged over the entire region of emitters at the end of the pump , as a function of pump amplitude .",
    "notice how the plot in fig .",
    "[ figure5]b oscillates ; this is because the area under the pump pulse ( which depends on both pump amplitude and duration ) determines the number of rabi cycles @xcite .",
    "thus different pump amplitudes generate greater or fewer rabi oscillations , leading to different values of the ground state population at the end of the pump .",
    "[ figure5 ] indicates that the amount of rabi splitting depends on the ground state population of the emitters , @xmath63 .",
    "we see that a large excited population of emitters in the entire groove will reduce or eliminate the rabi splitting whereas a smaller excited population will yield larger rabi splitting .",
    "we speculate that the coupling may take on a different character in the non - linear regime , perhaps to the extent that rabi splitting is not the only indicator of coupling strength .",
    "further investigation of the optical properties of excited emitters coupled to plasmons is clearly warranted .",
    "although the changes of @xmath63 are in step with changes in rabi splitting , large decreases of @xmath63 do not always give a correspondingly large decrease in rabi splitting and this can be understood in terms of the non - uniformity of @xmath63 throughout the groove . in particular , the pumping fields arrive at deeper parts of the groove later than they arrive at the top and the rabi oscillations are not perfectly in phase with one another along the length of the groove due to retardation .",
    "additionally , the spp fields are inhomogeneous throughout the groove .",
    "thus , the spatially averaged value of @xmath63 after the pump gives a good , though not ideal , indication of the subsequent coupling to spp fields .",

    "[ figure6]a shows a spatial distribution of @xmath63 at the end of @xmath65 fs long pump . a clear strong spatial variation of the ground state population is seen .",
    "in fact , the variations of the ground state population are oscillations whose wavelength varies somewhat over the region of emitters .",
    "one might surmise that the wavelength of these oscillations is on the order of that of the pump , but it is actually significantly smaller . to investigate this further",
    ", we numerically solve the schrdinger equation for a one - dimensional region of two - level atoms ( finite along , say , the @xmath11-axis while infinite along two others ) subject to excitation from a pump .    because we consider a one - dimensional region , retardation effects",
    "must be included by using the retarded time @xmath72 , where v is the speed of light in the medium in the expression for the pulse .",
    "the retardation effects are revealed to be the cause of the spatial modulations of the ground state population , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure6]b : the temporal oscillations of the ground state probability are similar between adjacent spatial points , but slightly shifted .",
    "hence at a given time , adjacent points have slightly different values of ground state probability .",
    "to further elucidate this idea , we generated larger phase shifts in the temporal oscillations between nearby points by adjusting two parameters : the pump amplitude and the propagation velocity of light in the emitter region .",
    "for a larger pump amplitude , each emitter will undergo rabi flopping more rapidly in time .",
    "thus a given phase shift between adjacent locations will lead to a larger shift in the ground state population between those two locations .",
    "this was observed in our simulations : in general , increasing the pump amplitude leads to an increase in the number of spatial oscillations of the ground state population over the region of emitters . for a slower group velocity ,",
    "the pump takes longer to reach an adjacent point , causing the temporal oscillations between two adjacent points to acquire a larger phase difference .",
    "our simulations allow for the adjustment of the group velocity of light in the emitter region , and we see that a decrease in the group velocity results in a greater number of spatial oscillations relative to a larger speed of light .",
    "[ figure6]c shows that group velocity is decreased ( in fact , negative since most emitters are inverted ) at the transition frequency of @xmath46 ev , and it is higher away from resonance .",
    "a negative group velocity is possible in inverted systems and has been experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "it is stated that this occurs when different frequency components of a pulse interfere with one another ( in a region of anomalous dispersion ) in such a way as to cause a resonant pulse to be advanced relative to a non - resonant pulse traveling at @xmath70 .",
    "we are assured by [ ] that this does not violate causality and that it occurs because the early parts of the pulse are reshaped to resemble the later pulse .",
    "furthermore , [ ] points out that in passing through a medium with negative group velocity , the information transmitted by the pulse front _ suffers a positive and causal delay_. our system was pumped ( in separate runs ) both on and off of resonance and fig .",
    "[ figure6]d shows that the wavelength of the spatial oscillations for the _ off resonance _",
    "pump is indeed increased relative to the _ on resonance _",
    "pump on account of the latter having a slower group velocity .",
    "all of these results indicate that retardation effects give rise to spatial oscillations in the ground state population of the emitters contained within the groove .",
    "the larger fields of the surface plasmons and the slower group velocity within the emitter region surely enhance these spatial oscillations .",
    "it may be possible to use this phenomenon to perform a new type of optical design using femtosecond pulses as a tool to craft hybrid systems .",
    "highly inhomogeneous spatial modulations of molecules lead to the modified refractive index , which is appreciably anisotropic .",
    "one can envision an exciting opportunity for a new research direction , in which both the geometry of metal nanostructures and pump pulses govern the refractive index of the system .",
    "furthermore one can apply optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms @xcite , for instance , to design materials with desired optical properties .",
    "the optical properties of the bare and hybrid v - groove systems have been explored under several different circumstances .",
    "two spp resonances with entirely different spatial distributions were shown . optical coupling between quantum emitters and spp waves",
    "was thoroughly characterized by simulating different groove geometries and spatial configurations of emitters distributions within the grooves .",
    "the value of rabi splitting was shown to vary with the pumping intensity and in accord with the ground state population .",
    "an explanation of this awaits a more developed understanding of coupling in the non - linear regime .",
    "spatial oscillations of the ground state population of emitters within the groove are shown to be the result of field retardation .",

    "<S> we investigate the optical response of a system consisting of periodic silver v - grooves interacting with quantum emitters . </S>",
    "<S> two surface plasmon - polariton resonances are identified in the reflection spectrum of bare silver grooves , with the intensity of one resonance being localized near the bottom of the groove and that of the other resonance being distributed throughout the entire groove . </S>",
    "<S> the linear response of the hybrid silver - emitter system is thoroughly analyzed by considering the coupling between surface plasmon polaritons and emitters as the geometry of the grooves and the spatial distribution of emitters within the grooves are varied . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear response of the system is also considered by pumping the emitters with a short , high - intensity pulse . by changing the duration or the intensity of the pump , </S>",
    "<S> the population of emitters in the ground state at the end of the pump is varied , and it is found ( upon probing with a short pulse ) that an increase in the fraction of emitters in the ground state corresponds to an increase in rabi splitting . </S>",
    "<S> spatial variations in the ground state population throughout the emitter region are shown to be a result of field retardation . </S>"
