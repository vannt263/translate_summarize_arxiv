    "it has been known for almost twenty years ( see @xcite ) that any curve @xmath2 of genus  @xmath3 has at most @xmath4 points rational over  @xmath0 as @xmath5 ( the _ drinfeld-@xmath6vldu  bound _",
    "@xcite ) , and that if @xmath1 is a square then there are various families of classical , shimura , or drinfeld modular curves  @xmath2 of genus @xmath5 with @xmath7 .",
    "thus such curves are `` asymptotically optimal '' : they attain the lim  sup of @xmath8 . moreover , asymptotically optimal curves yield excellent linear error - correcting codes over  @xmath0  @xcite .    to actually construct and use these goppa codes",
    "one needs explicit equations for asymptotically optimal  @xmath9 .",
    "now the definitions of modular curves are in principle constructive , but it is usually not feasible to actually exhibit a given modular curve . for certain drinfeld modular curves ,",
    "@xcite gives explicit , albeit unpleasant , models as plane curves with two complicated singularities .",
    "garcia and stichtenoth gave nice formulas for asymptotically optimal families of curves in  @xcite for @xmath10 ( see also @xcite ) , and in  @xcite for all square prime powers  @xmath1 .",
    "in each case they construct a sequence of curves @xmath11 forming what we ll call a _ recursive tower . _ a `` tower '' @xmath12 is a sequence of curves in which each @xmath13 is given as a low - degree cover of @xmath14 .",
    "we shall call a tower `` recursive '' if @xmath15 is given as a curve in @xmath16 , and @xmath13 is the curve in @xmath17 consisting of @xmath18-tuples @xmath19 of points in  @xmath20 such that @xmath21 for each @xmath22 .",
    "that is , @xmath13 is obtained by iterating @xmath23 times the correspondence from  @xmath20 to itself given by  @xmath15 . in each of the cases discovered by garcia and stichtenoth , analysis of this",
    "correspondence yields the genus of each @xmath13 and enough @xmath0-rational points on  @xmath13 to prove that @xmath24 .",
    "the genus grows exponentially with  @xmath18 , yet only @xmath25 equations of bounded degree are needed to exhibit @xmath13 .",
    "now while equations for most modular curves can not be reasonably exhibited , modular curves whose conductors are products of small primes form towers , and modular curves with a single repeated factor even form recursive towers . for instance , for any integers @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the classical modular curves @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) form a recursive tower of curves related by maps of degree  @xmath30 .",
    "there are analogous towers of shimura and drinfeld modular curves .",
    "we observed in  @xcite that this can be used to exhibit asymptotically optimal towers , and carried out the computation of explicit equations for eight such towers , six of classical modular curves and two of shimura curves .",
    "moreover , we showed that the towers of classical modular curves @xmath31 and @xmath32 in characteristics  @xmath33 and  @xmath34 respectively are the same as the towers constructed in  @xcite .    in the same paper we noted that similar methods can be used to exhibit towers of drinfeld modular curves , and announced that one such tower recovers the curves constructed in  @xcite for arbitrary square  @xmath1 . in the present paper",
    "we specify this tower and perform the computations that determine its equations and thus identify it with the garcia - stichtenoth tower .",
    "we do the same for a closely related tower obtained by garcia and stichtenoth in  @xcite . in the next section we recall basic definitions of drinfeld modules , isogenies , and supersingularity .",
    "the following section describes certain drinfeld modular curves . in both sections",
    "we simplify the exposition by describing only the modules and curves that arise in the interpretation of the garcia - stichtenoth towers ; for a thorough treatment of the general case we refer to @xcite . in the final section we give explicit equations for several of the simplest towers of drinfeld modular curves and observe that two of them coincide with asymptotically optimal towers obtained by garcia and stichtenoth",

    "then the points of  @xmath56 constitute a vector space of dimension @xmath50 or  @xmath49 over the field @xmath97 .",
    "the drinfeld module  @xmath56 is then said to be _ supersingular _ if @xmath98 , _ ordinary _ otherwise .",

    "thus , in analogy with the case of the classical modular curves parametrizing elliptic curves , we refer to the @xmath111-line as the _ drinfeld modular curve _",
    "@xmath116 for drinfeld modules with a given @xmath64 .",
    "likewise , for @xmath117 such that @xmath118 , we have drinfeld modular curves @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 parametrizing drinfeld modules with a given @xmath64 and a choice of torsion subgroup @xmath122 , or such a subgroup  @xmath82 together with a generator of  @xmath82 as an @xmath53-module , or an identification of the group of @xmath123-torsion points with @xmath124 .",

    "more generally , reducing the @xmath107 curves modulo any irreducible @xmath96 yields the curves parametrizing drinfeld modules for which @xmath129 is a root of  @xmath102 .",

    "the supersingular points on @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 are then the preimages of @xmath130 under the natural maps from those drinfeld modular curves to  @xmath116 .",
    "it is known that each supersingular point on  @xmath119 is defined over the quadratic extension  @xmath0 of  @xmath35 , and that the same is true for certain twists of @xmath120 and of each component of  @xmath121 .",
    "we shall relate the garcia - stichtenoth curves to certain drinfeld modular curves with @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "we shall find that in some cases the modules parametrized by these curves must satisfy the additional condition @xmath133 , i.e.@xmath134 we call such drinfeld modules _",
    "normalized_. a drinfeld module  @xmath56 with @xmath132 is isomorphic to a normalized one if and only @xmath135 is a @xmath136-st power .",
    "this condition is invariant under isogeny .",
    "one thus expects that there would be an equivalent condition in terms of the torsion structure of  @xmath56 .",
    "such a condition can not be given in completely elementary terms , because @xmath137 does not have a large enough cyclic quotient .",
    "but one can give an equivalent condition in terms of @xmath138 .",
    "for a general drinfeld module  @xmath56 given by ( [ phi(t ) ] ) , `` @xmath138 '' is the rank-@xmath50 module @xmath139 , whose tate modules are the discriminants of those of @xmath56 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm.4.1 ) .",
    "thus @xmath56 is normalized if and only if @xmath138 takes @xmath92 to @xmath140 .    in terms of the coordinate  @xmath111 on @xmath141 , the condition that @xmath56 be equivalent to a normalized module",
    "is that @xmath142 be a @xmath143-st power .",
    "thus normalized modules , or normalized modules with suitable level-@xmath123 structure , are parametrized by curves we shall call @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , whose function fields are obtained from those of @xmath148 by adjoining a @xmath143-st root of @xmath149 .    now by analogy with the case of classical and shimura curves , one might expect that the curves @xmath150 are asymptotically optimal over @xmath0 , and that the same is true of the twists mentioned earlier of @xmath120 and of the components of @xmath121 , with supersingular points already providing @xmath151 rational points in each case .",
    "one might even hope that the same is true with @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 replaced by @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157",
    ". it would be enough to prove this for @xmath147 , since all the other curves listed are quotients of @xmath147 by subgroups of @xmath126 .",
    "this is stated explicitly in the literature only for components of @xmath121 in the case that @xmath123 is an irreducible polynomial of odd degree ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "we expect that the same is true for @xmath147 and arbitrary  @xmath123 , and indeed even for modular curves for drinfeld modules over rings other than @xmath158 $ ] . in each case",
    "the supersingular points are readily enumerated , and the main technical challenge is computing the genus of the curve , since the covering maps to @xmath116 are highly and wildly ramified above the `` cusp '' @xmath159 .",
    "[ this was also the most difficult part of garcia and stichtenoth s direct construction in  @xcite . ]",
    "even though explicit statements of asymptotic optimality have not been made , the genera of @xmath150 , @xmath120 , and the components of  @xmath121 are known .",

    "the curves @xmath120 were treated in  @xcite .",
    "these results , combined with the enumeration of supersingular points , should yield the asymptotic optimality of all these curves over  @xmath0 .",
    "alternatively , m.  zieve suggests , and gekeler confirms by e - mail , that one may be able to entirely avoid the genus computation and the enumeration of supersingular points by adapting an earlier proof by ihara @xcite that a classical modular curve of genus  @xmath160 has at least @xmath161 points rational over the field of @xmath162 elements .",
    "that argument uses the reduction mod  @xmath163 of certain hecke correspondences on the curve , such as @xmath164 considered as a correspondence on @xmath119 via its map to @xmath165 ( when @xmath166 ) ; similar correspondences are available in the drinfeld modular setting .",
    "we are not aware of a published analysis along the same lines of the curves @xmath167 etc . ; but as gekeler points out it should be straightforward to obtain their genera from those of @xmath119 etc . ,",

    "the results of the next section , together with the genus calculations in  @xcite , show at least that the curves @xmath168 are asymptotically optimal .",
    "if @xmath170 is a nonzero torsion point of  @xmath56 then we can solve for  @xmath160 by setting ( [ t - torsion ] ) equal to zero , obtaining @xmath171 thus @xmath170 may be regarded as a coordinate for the rational curve @xmath172 parametrizing normalized drinfeld modules @xmath56 with a @xmath92-torsion point . for any nonzero  @xmath93 we let @xmath173 be the corresponding linearized polynomial @xmath174 the supersingular @xmath170 are those for which the @xmath175 coefficient of @xmath176 vanishes , i.e.  the units of the quadratic extension  @xmath0 of  @xmath35 .",

    "note that @xmath180 , but for @xmath181 the curve @xmath178 is only a quotient of @xmath182 , because , as in the case of elliptic curves , we demand not that each point of @xmath183 be rational , only that @xmath183 be permuted by galois .",
