    "the question of existence of first integrals for holomorphic foliations on @xmath5 depends heavily on the resolution algorithm due to bendixson ( @xcite ) and after rediscovered by seidenberg ( @xcite ) . in dimension three",
    "the subject has been developed by cano ( @xcite ) and more recently , in the real analytic case , by panazzolo ( @xcite ) , with the aid of the concept of weighted blow - up .",
    "this resolution leads to an ambient three - fold which is no more regular but has toroidal singularities ( more precisely weighted projective spaces ) . on the other hand , as a consequence of a monomialization theorem due to cutkosky ( @xcite )",
    ", any singular holomorphic foliation on @xmath2 having a holomorphic first integral ( see definition below ) can be resolved with a finite number of monoidal transformations , avoiding the presence of singularities in the ambient three - fold of the resolved foliation .",
    "generically , the singularities which appear after the resolution process are non - degenerate ( and thus isolated ) , and have three ( transverse ) invariant planes through each singularity . due to this fact , we consider along this work mainly singular holomorphic foliations satisfying the above properties .    in this work we study topological and algebraic conditions for the existence of holomorphic first integrals in a spirit similar to to the classical approach for the two - dimensional case studied in @xcite .",
    "neverteless , some differences arise with respect to the @xmath6-dimensional case .",
    "the first is the fact that a stronger condition than the siegel condition on the eigenvalues is required ( see definition  [ definition : conditionstar ] below ) .",
    "also in order to find suitable integrable codimension one distributions containing the trajectories of @xmath1 we need to apply some techniques from partial differential equations ( problem  [ geometric integrability ] and  [ subsection : solution ] ) .",
    "denote the ring of germs of holomorphic functions on @xmath7 by @xmath8 and its maximal ideal by @xmath9 .",
    "we say that a germ of one - dimensional holomorphic foliation @xmath0 on @xmath7 given by the ( germ of ) holomorphic vector field @xmath10 is _ integrable _ , or _ has a holomorphic first integral _ , if there is a germ of holomorphic map @xmath11 such that @xmath12 the leaves of @xmath0 are contained in level curves of @xmath4 or equivalently @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath4 is a submersion off @xmath15 , the _ singular set of _ @xmath0 .",
