    "entanglement , one of the most striking features of quantum mechanics , has been considered as a key resource of quantum information processing @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the manipulation of quantum entanglement for the system of the cavity quantum electrodynamics(qed ) has been extensively investigated@xcite .",
    "the cavity qed , where atoms interacting with quantized electromagnetic fields inside a cavity , can be used to create the entanglement between atoms in cavities and establish quantum communications between different optical cavities .",
    "it has been shown that the entanglement can arise in the interaction of a atom with a cavity field in a thermal state @xcite and two atoms with a cavity field @xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "solano _ et al_. have shown that multipartite entanglement can be generated by putting several two - level atoms in a cavity of high quality factor . with the help of a strong classical driving fields ,",
    "the schrdinger cat state and other entangled states can be produced .",
    "on the other hand , many efforts have been devoted to the study of the evolution of the joint system formed by two qubits@xcite . particularly , yu and eberly @xcite pointed out that the single - qubit dynamics and the global dynamics of an entangled two - qubit system subjected to independent environments may be rather different .",
    "for example , for a single - qubit system subjected to an environment , the local coherence decays asymptotically .",
    "however , the entanglement of an entangled two - qubit system may disappear within a finite time during the dynamics evolution .",
    "the nonsmooth finite - time disappearance of entanglement is called `` entanglement sudden death '' ( esd ) .",
    "recently , it is reported that the esd phenomenon has been observed in a quantum optics experiment @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we propose a scheme to enhance the entanglement of a quantum system consisting of two - level atoms within cavities by applying and controlling classical driving fields .",
    "the influence of the classical field and the purity of the initial state on the esd is also studied .",
    "first , we study the entanglement of the two - level atom and the field by employing logarithmic negativity @xcite .",
    "then , we consider a quantum system consisting of two noninteracting atoms each locally interacting with its own vacuum field .",
    "the two atoms , which are initially prepared in extended werner - like ( ewl ) states @xcite , are driven by two independent classical fields additionally .",
    "it is shown that the esd may appear in this system and the esd time can be retarded by increasing the purity of the initial state of the two atoms .",
    "in addition , the amount of the entanglement of the two atoms can be significantly increased by applying classical fields .",
    "we find that the time of entanglement sudden death can be controlled by the classical driving fields .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the entanglement sudden death phenomenon disappear if the classical driving fields are strong enough .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we propose a scheme to improve the entanglement of a two - level atom interacting with vacuum or thermal field by applying a classical driving field . in section iii , we study the influence of the classical driving fields on the esd when the atoms are initially prepared in ewl states .",
    "a conclusion is given in section iv .",
    "now , we consider a system consisting of a two - level atom inside a single mode cavity .",

    "thus , the entanglement of the system considered here will not be changed by applying the local unitary transformations @xmath29 and @xmath24 .",
    "we study the entanglement of the system by employing the logarithmic negativity . for a bipartite system described by density matrix @xmath30 ,",
    "the logarithmic negativity is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the partial transpose of @xmath30 , @xmath33 stands for the trace norm of @xmath32 and n is negativity which is defined by @xcite @xmath34 which is just the absolute value of the sum of the negative eigenvalues of @xmath32 .",
