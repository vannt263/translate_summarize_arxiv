    "one of the challenges of strong interaction physics nowadays is to understand the phase diagram of quantum chomodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "particular interest is devoted to the high density and low temperature region because of possible applications for the physics of compact stars .",
    "these investigations became very exciting since it has been reported that the energy gaps of color superconducting quark matter could be as big as @xmath4 mev @xcite and thus being of the same order as the constituent quark masses dynamically generated in the chiral symmetry breaking transition .",
    "gaps this large could not only have a direct influence on the quark matter equation of state ( eos ) but , due to the bcs relation @xmath5 critical temperatures would imply that quark matter if formed early in the protoneutron star evolution should be color superconducting .",
    "dense and cold matter has been broadly studied for the flavor symmetric case ( for reviews , see @xcite ) . from first principles ,",
    "the limit of asymptotic densities can be studied and it was found that the color - flavor - locking ( cfl ) phase , in which quarks of all three colors and flavors participate in the condensation , is energetically favorable ( see @xcite ) . using the simple nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite , it was found that for intermediate densities the 2sc phase was favored @xcite .",
    "therefore , a typical phase diagram calculated for the flavor symmetric case shows the low temperature and high density domain being in one of the color superconducting quark matter phases .",
    "however , for compact star applications the situation is much more complex : equilibrium w.r.t .",
    "weak interactions ( @xmath6-equilibrium ) , color and charge neutrality impose additional constraints to dense matter .",
    "alford and rajagopal pointed out the difficulty of the 2sc phase to achieve charge neutrality and therefore they claimed that this phase would not be realized in compact stars @xcite . without solving the gap equation , they treated the strange quark mass as a parameter in their calculations and concluded that the cfl phase would be favorable against 2sc .",
    "more recently , steiner , reddy and prakash @xcite found within an njl model calculation that the 2sc phase may be realized only in a very small region of the phase diagram at lower densities which eventually would be covered by the hadronic phase if it was properly take into account .",
    "again , the 2sc phase seemed not to be reliable , basically because the charge neutrality condition imposes a strong constraint to the quark chemical potentials .",
    "the discussion of the existence of a mixed phase of 2sc quark matter and normal quark matter ( nq-2sc ) by increasing the asymmetry between the up and down quarks number densities was first performed by bedaque @xcite . within the njl model ,",
    "a detailed study of possible neutral mixed phases in @xmath6-equilibrium has been performed by neumann , buballa and oertel @xcite considering global neutrality between the phases . in accordance with the earlier expectations",
    ", these authors showed that at very low densities - where the model is probably to fail - the normal quark matter component is dominant , at intermediate ones the 2sc phase and at still higher densities , the cfl phase .",
    "moreover , the latter phase and the strange quarks is supossed to appear at very high densities ( nearly above @xmath7 mev @xcite ) that barely reached in the very inner core of compact stars and thus leading to no observable effects .",
    "unfortunately , in the intermediate density region we have no rigorous calculations and we have to rely on phenomenological models suitable , however , for the investigation of qualitative features of the phase diagram . the above mentioned and widely used njl has the great advantage that chiral symmetry breaking and diquark condensation are treated at the same mean - field level as phase transitions of an interacting field theory .    besides well - known limitations of the njl - type models ( no confinement , non - renormalizable ) there is some arbitrariness in the choice of the model parameters even if the strategy is followed that vacuum properties of low - lying hadrons should be reproduced ( e.g. the pion mass , pion decay constant and the chiral condensate ) , see e.g. @xcite for reviews .    in this work",
    "we use a chiral quark model that can represent the nonlocality of the quark interactions in a more realistic way via formfactor functions . furthermore , we vary the softness of these functions and analyze its consequences in the phase structure .",
    "we investigate the parameter regime and obtain that no pure 2sc itself does occur under compact star constraints for low temperatures ( below @xmath8 mev ) .",
    "we also study the relevant region of the phase diagram for compact star applications and obtain that neither gapless 2sc ( g2sc @xcite ) exists ; its occurence is limited to a narrow window for higher temperatures ( above 40 mev ) before the second order phase transition to the deconfined phase takes place .    for rather strong coupling constants in the diquark channel ( @xmath9 0.86 )",
    "a mixed phase nq-2sc is likely to occur in the interior of compact stars .",
    "for particular values of @xmath0 the corresponding equation of state has been already succesfully used for hybrid star configurations , explaining the mass - radius relation of very compact objects like rx  j185635 - 3754 @xcite or a huge release of energy in the evolution of a protoneutron star with trapped antineutrinos @xcite .    nevertheless , for weak and intermediate coupling constants ( even for @xmath10 , the value suggested by the fierz transformation of a massive gluon exchange or two - flavor instanton induced interaction @xcite ) , the 2sc phase is unlike to occur .",
    "if this is the case , this result could have important consequences for the neutron star phenomenology : if 2sc does not occur inside compact stars , then other patterns of diquark pairing satisfying color and charge neutrality can become energetically more favorable than normal quark matter .",
    "examples are spin-1 condensates , e.g. color - spin - locking ( csl ) phases @xcite the influence of the small gaps ( @xmath11 kev ) that are expected for these phases on compact star cooling has recently been investigated and they could realize the appropriate cooling phenomenology @xcite .",
    "we use a nonlocal chiral model for quark matter in the 2sc phase to study dense neutral matter in compact stars following @xcite .",
    "formfactor functions @xmath12 model the nonlocality of the quark interaction in the momentum space .",
    "we assume that this four fermion interaction is instantaneous and therefore the formfactors depend only on the modulus of the three - momentum @xmath13 . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the coupling constants in the scalar meson and the diquark channels , respectively .",
    "while @xmath14 is fixed together with the current quark mass and range parameters of the formfactors ( see below ) from hadron observables , @xmath15 is a free parameter of the approach which we vary using the parameter @xmath16 .    in the mean field approximation",
    "the grand canonical thermodynamic potential is a function of the temperature @xmath17 and of the chemical potentials @xmath18 for the quark with flavor @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) and color @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) given by @xmath23 where the effective potential @xmath24 is a function of the order parameters of the theory : the mass gap @xmath25 and the diquark gap @xmath26 .",
    "the constant @xmath27 is chosen such that the pressure of the physical vacuum vanishes .",
    "the matsubara frequencies for fermions are given by @xmath28 and the nambu - gorkov inverse quark propagator can be obtained as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the chemical potential matrix and the elements of @xmath31 are the dynamical masses of the quarks given by @xmath32 . here , @xmath33 is the usual matrix in the dirac space and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are antisymmetric tensors in the flavor and color spaces respectively .",
    "the nonlocality of the interaction between the quarks in both channels quark - antiquark ( @xmath36 ) and quark - quark ( @xmath37 ) is implemented via the same formfactor functions @xmath12 . in our calculations",
    "we use the gaussian ( g ) , lorentzian ( l ) and cutoff ( njl ) formfactors defined as @xmath38^{-1},\\\\ \\label{nf } g_{\\rm njl}(p ) & = & \\theta(1 - p/\\lambda_{\\rm njl})~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameter sets ( quark mass @xmath39 , coupling constant @xmath14 , interaction range @xmath40 ) for the above formfactor models ( see tab .",
