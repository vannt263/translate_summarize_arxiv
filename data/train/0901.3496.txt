    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are excellent cosmological distance indicators due to their high luminosities and remarkable uniformity .",
    "they have been applied successfully in determining cosmological parameters ( e.g. @xmath3 and @xmath4 ; riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) .",
    "it is widely believed that sne ia are thermonuclear explosions of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs ( co wds ) accreting matter from their companions ( see a review of nomoto et al .",
    "however , several key issues related to the nature of their progenitor systems and the physics of the explosion mechanisms are still not well understood ( hillebrandt & niemeyer 2000 ; rpke & hillebrandt 2005 ; wang et al .",
    "2008 ; podsiadlowski et al . 2008 ) , which may raise doubts about the distance calibration being purely empirical and on the basis of the sn ia sample of the low red - shift universe .    at present ,",
    "two sn ia explosion models are discussed frequently , that is , chandrasekhar ( ch ) mass model and sub - chandrasekhar ( sub - ch ) mass model .",
    "the synthetic spectra of the ch mass model are in excellent agreement with the early time spectra of most sne ia , while that of the sub - ch mass model has difficulty in matching observations ( hflich @xmath5 khokhlov 1996 ) .",
    "a co wd can increase its mass to the ch mass through a single degenerate ( sd ) scenario , where the co wd accretes h / he - rich material from a non - degenerate companion star ( whelan & iben 1973 ; nomoto et al .",
    "1984 ) , or through a double degenerate ( dd ) scenario , where another co wd mergers with it and the total mass of the two co wds is larger than the ch mass limit ( iben & tutukov 1984 ; webbink 1984 ) .",
    "theoretically , it is suggested that the dd scenario likely leads to an accretion - induced collapse rather than a sn ia ( nomoto & iben 1985 ; saio & nomoto 1985 ; timmes et al .",
    "1994 ) .    for the sd ch scenario ,",
    "the companion is probably a ms star or a slightly evolved subgiant star ( wd + ms channel ) , or a redgiant star ( wd + rg channel ) ( hachisu et al .",
    "1996 , 1999a , 1999b ; li @xmath5 van den heuvel 1997 ; langer et al .",
    "2000 ; han @xmath5 podsiadlowski 2004 , 2006 ; chen & li 2007 ; meng et al .",
    "2008 ; han 2008 ) . meanwhile , a co wd may also accrete material from a he star companion to increase its mass to the ch mass , which is known as the he star donor channel in this paper .",
    "the study of iben @xmath5 tutukov ( 1994 ) showed that wd + he star systems can be formed via binary evolutions .",
    "yoon @xmath5 langer ( 2003 ) have carried out the evolution of a co wd + he star system with a @xmath6 co wd and a @xmath7 he star in a 0.124 day orbit . in this binary , the wd accretes he from the he star and grows in mass to the ch mass .",
    "it is believed that wd + he star systems are generally originated from intermediate - mass binary systems .",
    "thus , this channel may explain sne ia with short delay times ( mannucci et al . 2006 ; aubourg et al . 2008 ) . at present , however , there are no comprehensive investigations on this channel .",
    "the existence of wd + he star systems is supported by some observations .",
    "for example , kpd 1930 + 2752 is suggested to be such a system ( maxted et al .",
    "2000 ; geier et al .",
    "another example is from the discovery of a he nova , v455 pup ( ashok & banerjee 2003 ; kato & hachisu 2003 ) .",
    "recently , kato et al . (",
    "2008 ) presented a free - free emission dominated light curve model of v445 pup , based on an optically thick wind theory ( kato & hachisu 1994 ; hachisu et al .",
    "the light curve fitting in their study showed that the mass of the wd is lager than @xmath8 , and half of the accreted matter remains on the wd , leading to the mass increase of the wd .",
    "thus , v445 pup is suggested to be a strong candidate of sn ia progenitor ( kato et al .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the he star donor channel for sn ia progenitors comprehensively and systemically , and then to determine the valid parameter spaces for sne ia , which can be used in binary population synthesis ( bps ) studies . in section 2 ,",
    "we describe the numerical code for the binary evolution calculations and the grid of the binary models .",
    "the binary evolutionary results is shown in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we estimate sn ia birthrate of this channel .",
    "finally , a discussion is given in section 5 , and a summary in section 6 .",
    "in wd + he star systems , the he star fills its roche lobe at he ms or he subgiant stage , and then the mass transfer begins .",
    "the he star transfers some of its material onto the surface of the wd , which increases the mass of the wd as a consequence . if the wd grows to 1.378@xmath9 , we assume that the wd explodes as a sn ia .",
    "here we use eggleton s stellar evolution code ( eggleton 1971 , 1972 , 1973 ) to calculate the binary evolutions of wd + he star systems .",
    "the code has been updated with the latest input physics over the last three decades ( han et al .",
    "1994 ; pols et al .",
    "1995 , 1998 ) .",
    "roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) is treated within the code described by han et al .",
    "we set the ratio of mixing length to local pressure scale height , @xmath10 , to be 2.0 .",
    "the opacity tables are compiled by chen & tout ( 2007 ) from iglesias & rogers ( 1996 ) and alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) . in our calculations , the he star models are composed of he abundance @xmath11 and metallicity @xmath12 , and all calculations for the he stars are carried out without enhanced mixing ( i.e. the overshooting parameter , @xmath13 , is taken to be zero ; see dewi et al .",
    "in addition , orbital angular momentum loss due to gravitational wave radiation ( gwr ) is included by adopting a standard formula presented by landau & lifshitz ( 1971 ) , @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the gravitational constant , vacuum speed of light , the mass of the accreting wd and the mass of the companion he star , respectively .    instead of solving stellar structure equations of a wd",
    ", we use an optically thick wind model ( kato & hachisu 1994 ; hachisu et al .",
    "1996 ) and adopt the prescription of kato & hachisu ( 2004 ) ( kh04 ) for the mass accumulation efficiency of he - shell flashes onto the wd . if the mass transfer rate , @xmath19 , is above a critical rate , @xmath20 , we assume that he burns steadily on the surface of the wd and that the he - rich matter is converted into c and o at a rate @xmath20 .",
    "the unprocessed matter is lost from the system , presumably in the form of an optically thick wind at a mass loss rate @xmath21 .",
    "the critical mass transfer rate is @xmath22 based on wd models computed with constant mass accretion rates ( nomoto 1982 ) .",
    "following assumptions are adopted when @xmath19 is smaller than @xmath20 .",
    "( 1 ) if @xmath19 is less than @xmath23 but higher than the minimum accretion rate of stable he - shell burning , @xmath24 ( kh04 ) , it is assumed that the he - shell burning is stable and that there is no mass loss .",
    "( 2 ) if @xmath25 is less than @xmath24 but higher than the minimum accretion rate of weak he - shell flashes , @xmath26 ( woosley et al .",
    "1986 ) , he - shell flashes occur and a part of the envelope mass is assumed to be blown off from the surface of the wd . the mass growth rate of wds in this case is linearly interpolated from a grid computed by kh04 , where a wide range of wd mass and accretion rate were calculated in the he - shell flashes .",
    "( 3 ) if @xmath19 is lower than @xmath27 , the he - shell flashes will be so strong that no mass can be accumulated onto the wd .",
    "we define the mass growth rate of the co wd , @xmath28 , as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mass accumulation efficiency for he - shell burning . according to the assumptions above",
    ", the values of @xmath30 are : @xmath31    we incorporate the prescriptions above into eggleton s stellar evolution code and follow the binary evolutions of wd + he star systems .",
    "the mass lost from these systems is assumed to take away specific orbital angular momentum of the accreting wd .",
    "we have calculated about 2600 wd + he star systems , and obtained a large , dense model grid .",
    "the initial mass of the donor stars , @xmath32 , ranges from @xmath33 to @xmath34 ; the initial mass of the co wds , @xmath35 , is from @xmath36 to @xmath37 ; the initial orbital period of the binary systems , @xmath38 , changes from the minimum value , at which a he zero - age ms ( he zams ) star would fill its roche lobe , to @xmath39 days , where the he star fills its roche lobe at the end of the hertzsprung gap .",
    "in figs 1 - 4 , we present three representative cases in our binary evolution calculations according to the condition of the binary system at the moment of sn explosion , and display one special case for producing sne ia . in panels ( a ) of these figures ,",
    "we show the @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath17 varing with time , and the panels ( b ) are the evolutionary tracks of the he stars in the hertzsprung - russell diagrams , where the evolutions of the orbital periods are also shown .",
    "\\(i ) _ case 1 _ ( see fig",
    ". 1 ) : the binary system is in the weak he - shell flash phase at the moment of the sn explosion . the binary shown in this case is ( @xmath42 , @xmath35 , @xmath43 ) @xmath44 ( 1.35 , 0.9 , -1.20 ) , where @xmath42 , @xmath35 and @xmath38 are the initial mass of the he star and of the co wd in solar masses , and the initial orbital period in days , respectively . in this case , the he star fills its roche lobe after the exhaustion of central he ( it now contains a co core ) , and this results in case bb mass transfer .",
    "the mass transfer rate @xmath45 exceeds @xmath46 soon after the onset of rlof , leading to a wind phase , where a part of the transferred mass is blown off in an optically thick wind , and the left is accumulated onto the wd .",
    "after about @xmath47yr , @xmath45 drops below @xmath23 but still higher than @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the optically thick wind stops and the he - shell burning is stable . with the continuous decreasing of @xmath45 , the system enters into a weak he - shell flash phase after about @xmath47yr .",
    "the wd always grows in mass until it explodes as a sn ia in the weak he - shell flash phase . at the sn explosion moment ,",
    "the mass of the donor star is @xmath48 and the orbital period @xmath49 .",
    "\\(ii ) _ case 2 _ ( see fig .",
    "2 ) : the binary system is in the stable he - shell burning phase at the moment of the sn explosion .",
    "the binary in this case is ( @xmath42 , @xmath35 , @xmath50 ) @xmath44 ( 1.40 , 1.00 , -1.10 ) .",
    "the binary evolves in a similar way to that of _ case 1 _ , but it is in stable he - shell burning stage when the co wd reaches @xmath51 .",
    "the binary parameters at @xmath52 are @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "\\(iii ) _ case 3 _ ( see fig .",
    "3 ) : the binary system is in the optically thick wind phase at the moment of the sn explosion .",
    "the binary in this case is ( @xmath42 , @xmath35 , @xmath43 ) @xmath44 ( 1.80 , 1.10 , -0.60 ) .",
    "since the initial mass of the wd is more massive than that of the other two cases above , the wd may grow in mass to the ch mass more easily , that is , it is still in the optically thick wind phase when @xmath55 , at which @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "\\(iv ) _ case 4 _ ( see fig .",
    "4 ) : this case differs from the three above . before the sn explosion , the binary system experiences two mass transfer phases .",
    "the binary in this case is ( @xmath42 , @xmath35 , @xmath58 ) @xmath44 ( 1.25 , 1.10 , -1.30 ) . due to the short initial orbital period of the system , angular momentum loss induced by gwr",
    "leads the he star to fill its roche lobe before the exhaustion of central he , resulting in case ba mass transfer .",
    "the mass transfer continues to proceed until the mass donor starts to shrink below its roche lobe , terminating the mass transfer phase .",
    "after it has exhausted he in its core , the he star expands and fills its roche lobe again when it evolves to the subgiant stage , leading to case bb evolution .",
    "the following evolution of this system is similar to _",
    "case 1_. when the accreting wd grows to the ch mass , the binary is in the he - shell flash phase , and the binary parameters are @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "figs 5 - 7 show the final outcomes of about 2600 binary evolution calculations in the initial orbital period  secondary mass ( @xmath0 ) plane , where the filled symbols are for those resulting in sn ia explosions .",
    "the different cases described in section 3.1 are plotted with different symbols , that is , the filled squares , circles and triangles denote that the wd explodes in the optically thick wind phase , in the stable he - shell burning phase and in the weak he - shell flash phase , respectively .",
    "some wd + he star systems fail to produce sne ia because of he nova explosions ( which prevents the wd growing in mass ; the crosses in these figures ) or dynamically unstable mass transfer ( resulting in a common envelope ; open circles in these figures ) .",
    "note that , the left boundaries of the initial @xmath61 plane in these figures are determined by the minimum value of @xmath62 , at which the he zams star would fill its roche lobe .",
    "the contours of initial parameters for producing sne ia are also presented in these figures .",
    "the left boundaries of the contours in these figures ( figs 5 - 6 and panel c of fig .",
    "7 ) are set by the condition that rlof starts when the secondary is on the he zams , while systems beyond the right boundary experience mass transfer at a very high rate due to the rapid expansion of the he stars in the subgiant stage and they lose too much mass via the optically thick wind , preventing the wds increasing their masses to the ch mass .",
    "the upper boundaries are also set mainly by a high mass transfer rate but owing to a large mass ratio .",
    "the lower boundaries are constrained by the facts that the mass transfer rate @xmath63 should be high enough to ensure that the wd can grow in mass , and that the donor is sufficiently massive so that enough mass can be transferred onto the wd to reach the ch mass .",
    "there is a time delay ( up to about @xmath64yr ) from the formation of",
    "most wd + he star systems to the onset of rlofs , and this time delay varies with component masses and initial orbital periods .",
    "8 shows the contours at the onset of rlof for producing sne ia in the @xmath65 plane for various wd masses ( i.e. @xmath35 = 0.865 , 0.90 , 1.0 , 1.1 and @xmath66 ) , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the orbital period and the mass of the he companion star at the onset of rlof , respectively .",
    "note that , the enclosed region almost vanishes for @xmath69 , which is then assumed to be the minimum wd mass for producing sne ia from this channel .",
    "if the parameters of a co wd + he star system at the onset of rlof are located in the contours , a sn ia is then assumed to be produced .",
    "thus , these contours can be expediently used in bps studies .",
    "one can send a request to wangbo@ynao.ac.cn for the data points of these contours and the interpolation fortran code for these contours .",
    "note , the contours for sne ia between figs 5 - 7 and fig .",
    "8 have some differences , that is , figs 5 - 7 are for initial parameters while fig . 8 for those at the onset of rlof .",
    "gwr may change the orbital period during this time , especially for binaries with short orbital periods ( i.e. less than 1 day in this paper ) .",
    "for example , the left boundary of the contour for @xmath70 in fig .",
    "8 has shorter periods than that in figs 5 - 7 , because angular momentum loss via gwr is more in short period binary systems than that in long period systems .",
    "adopting a prescription similar to that of hachisu et al .",
    "( 1999b ) and based on fig .",
    "8 of this paper , we can roughly estimate galactic sn ia birthrate from the he star donor channel by using equation ( 1 ) of iben & tutukov ( 1984 ) , i.e. @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the appropriate ranges of the initial mass ratio and the initial separation and the lower and upper limits of the primary mass for producing sne ia in solar masses , respectively .",
    "we give the details of the calculations in the following .",
    "to estimate the birthrate of sne ia , we divide the initial wd mass of @xmath35 into three intervals , i.e. @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 ( see also hachisu et al .",
    "we ignore the range of @xmath79 , since its birthrate is too small to contribute to the sn ia birthrate as seen in fig .",
    "we use equation ( 11 ) of yungelson et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to estimate @xmath74 and @xmath80 , i.e. the final core mass ( co wd mass ) versus the zams mass relation , @xmath81 where @xmath17 and @xmath82 are the mass of the final co wd and of the zams in solar masses , respectively .",
    "in addition , similar to hachisu et al .",
    "( 1999b ) , we also use an approximation relation to obtain @xmath73 , i.e. @xmath83 where @xmath84 is taken from the sn ia region in fig . 8 and",
    "the factor of @xmath85 comes from the conversion between the period and the separation .",
    "take wd mass interval of @xmath86 as an example , we find that sn ia explosions occur for the ranges of @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the initial mass of the primary at zams , and @xmath91 is the initial mass of the he star . using eggleton s stellar evolution code ,",
    "we can obtain the initial zams mass @xmath92 = 5.60@xmath9 for the final he - core mass of 0.95@xmath9 ( i.e. he star mass ) .",
    "considering the initial mass of the secondary at zams is not more than that of the primary at zams , we constrain the range of @xmath93 from @xmath94 to @xmath90 , where @xmath93 is the initial mass of the secondary at zams .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath95 by substituting @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 into equation ( 5 ) . the sn ia birthrates for different wd mass intervals are summarized in table 1 .",
    "note , for different initial wd masses , the birthrate tendency of this channel is different from that of wd + ms channel , that is , massive wds for producing sne ia have a high birthrate for the wd + he star channel .",
    "this is because that massive wds easily have massive he stars as their companions .    finally , the sum of sn ia birthrates for three intervals ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath86 ) gives @xmath102 in the galaxy , which is lower than that inferred observationally ( i.e. @xmath103 ; van den bergh & tammann 1991 ; cappellaro & turatto 1997 ) .",
    ".the birthrates of sne ia for different wd mass intervals . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in our work , we have not considered the influence of rotation on the he accreting wds . the calculations of yoon et al .",
    "( 2004 ) showed that , if rotation is taken into account , he burning is much less violent than that without rotating .",
    "this may significantly increase the accretion efficiency ( @xmath30 in this paper ) .",
    "meanwhile , the maximum stable mass of a rotating wd may be above the standard ch mass ( i.e. the super - ch mass model ; uenishi et al .",
    "2003 ; yoon & langer 2005 )",
    ". however , in this paper we mainly focus on the ch mass explosions of the accreting wds .",
    "yoon & langer ( 2003 ) ( yl03 ) only considered a case bb evolution of a co wd + he star system which could produce a sn ia . in this paper , we systematically studed the he star donor channel for the progenitors of sne ia ( including case ba and case bb binary evolution ) and showed the contours of sne ia for various initial wd masses .",
    "the binary studied in yl03 is located in the contours of this paper .",
    "however , there are some differences between our assumptions and theirs in mass accumulation efficiency .",
    "this is mainly because that the effect of wind mass loss in yl03 s calculation is taken into account based an empirical formula of wolf - rayet star mass loss , while we used an optically thick wind model ( kato & hachisu 1994 ; hachisu et al .",
    "1996 ) and adopted the prescription of kh04 for the mass accumulation efficiency of the he - shell flashes onto the wds .",
    "the estimated birthrate of this channel is @xmath104 , which is comparable to that of wd + ms channel ( this is considered as an important channel to sne ia ; han @xmath5 podsiadlowski 2004 ) .",
    "thus , the he star donor channel should not be ignored when we study the progenitors of sne ia , and this channel may increase the contribution of sd ch scenario to sn ia birthrate in theory .",
    "note , the estimated birthrate may be higher than that in a real condition , since the long orbit period ( i.e. @xmath105 day in fig .",
    "8) systems considered to produce sne ia in equation ( 1 ) of iben & tutukov ( 1984 ) may not contribute to sne ia .",
    "moreover , umeda et al .",
    "( 1999 ) concluded that the upper limit mass of co cores born in binaries is about @xmath106 .",
    "if this value is adopted as the upper limit of the co wd , the birthrate of sne ia from this channel will decrease to be @xmath107 in the galaxy .    some precursory studies ( iben & tutukov 1994 ; yl03 ) suggested that wd + he star systems may appear as supersoft x - ray sources ( ssss ) before sn ia explosions . the initial orbital periods of wd + he star systems producing sne ia for this channel range from @xmath108 1h to @xmath108 200days , which may explain ssss with various orbital periods .",
    "we can estimate the x - ray luminosity of a wd + he star system by @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the energy generation rate owing to he burning . a wd + he star system has luminosity around @xmath111 when he burning is stable on the surface of the wd , consistent with that of observed from ssss ( @xmath112 ; kahabka & van den heuvel 1997 ) .",
    "note , strong he ii @xmath113 lines are prominent in the luminous ssss ( see kahabka & van den heuvel 1997 ) .",
    "thus , we emphasize that sn ia progenitors in the he star donor channel may appear as ssss during the stable he - shell burning phase _ without winds_. by multiplying the birthrate , @xmath104 , with an average duration of the sss phase , @xmath108 several times @xmath114yr , we estimate the current number of this type of progenitors as ssss in the galaxy to be from a few to several hundred .",
    "however , we do not observe such number of wd + he star systems in sss phase .",
    "this may attribute to the galactic interstellar absorption of ssss ( di stefano & rappaport 1994 ; hachisu et al .",
    "moreover , di stefano & rappaport ( 1994 ) also suggested that circumstellar matter may play a role in the obscuration of x - rays ( see also hachisu et al .",
    "2008a ) .",
    "generally , a co wd + he star system is produced from an intermediate - mass binary , which can be found in stellar populations with relatively recent star formation .",
    "the minimum he star mass for producing sne ia from this channel is @xmath115 , with which we can roughly estimate the maximum delay time of this channel .",
    "the initial zams mass @xmath82 = 5.6@xmath9 can produce he star mass of 0.95@xmath9 ( see sect .",
    "the ms lifetime is about 81myr for a star of 5.6@xmath9 ( eggleton 2006 ) .",
    "moreover , we should consider the ms lifetime of he stars , since the he stars in long orbital period systems experience rlof after the exhaustion of central he .",
    "the ms lifetime of @xmath115 he star is about 18myr .",
    "thus , the maximum delay time of this channel is about @xmath116yr , i.e. the he star donor channel can explain sne ia with short delay times ( @xmath2yr ; mannucci et al . 2006 ; aubourg et al .",

    "<S> type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) play an important role in astrophysics , especially in the study of cosmic evolution . </S>",
    "<S> there are several progenitor models for sne ia proposed in the past years . in this paper , we have carried out a detailed study of the he star donor channel , in which a carbon - oxygen white dwarf ( co wd ) accretes material from a he main sequence star or a he subgiant to increase its mass to the chandrasekhar mass . employing eggleton s stellar evolution code with an optically thick wind assumption , and adopting the prescription of kato & hachisu ( 2004 ) for the mass accumulation efficiency of the he - shell flashes onto the wds </S>",
    "<S> , we performed binary evolution calculations for about 2600 close wd binary systems . according to these calculations </S>",
    "<S> , we mapped out the initial parameters for sne ia in the orbital period  secondary mass ( @xmath0 ) plane for various wd masses from this channel . </S>",
    "<S> the study shows that the he star donor channel is noteworthy for producing sne ia ( i.e. @xmath1 in the galaxy ) , and that the progenitors from this channel may appear as supersoft x - ray sources . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , this channel can explain sne ia with short delay times ( @xmath2yr ) , which is consistent with recent observational implications of young populations of sn ia progenitors .    </S>",
