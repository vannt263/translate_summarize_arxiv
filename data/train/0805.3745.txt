    "phase - separation fronts are critically important for the formation of phase - separation morphologies in many practical applications .",
    "two industrial examples are the domain formation in binary alloys @xcite and immersion precipitation membranes @xcite",
    ". a binary iron - carbon alloy which is slowly cooled from one side of the sample below its critical temperature may form a structure of alternating carbon - rich and carbon - poor bands @xcite .",
    "the temperature change moving through the alloy induces phase - separation where it crosses a critical value .",
    "a very different example is the formation of immersion - precipitation membranes . here a polymer - solvent mixture is immersed in a non - solvent .",
    "phase - separation is induced as the solvent diffuses out of the mixture and is replaced by the non - solvent .",
    "phase - separation starts at the initial interface . from there a phase - separation front advances into the mixture .",
    "both of these examples have in common that a space and time dependant parameter , _",
    "i.e. _ the temperature in the binary alloy case and the solvent concentration in the immersion precipitation case , induce phase - separation .",
    "we call such a quantity a control parameter . the advance of the temperature or the solvent concentration then constitutes a control parameter front which is responsible for inducing phase - separation .    despite its critical roll in the formation of complex structures ,",
    "only limited attention has been paid to this phenomenon .",
    "there are a few notable exceptions .",
    "furukawa @xcite examined the phase - separation in two dimensional binary mixtures following a sharp control parameter front and noted that the morphology formed was strongly determined by the speed of the front , and that morphology may change quite suddenly if the front speed is changed .",
    "hantz @xcite rediscovered the front speed dependence of morphology using a novel rotating control parameter front where the front speed depends on distance from the axis of rotation .",
    "dziarmaga @xcite suggested a model that is very similar to the one presented in the current work as a model for phase - separation in the early universe , and found that for slow fronts the density of domain walls is linear with front speed , _",
    "i.e. _ domain size is proportional to the inverse of front speed .",
    "when a control parameter front is not progressing too quickly a phase - separation front follows directly behind and therefore moves at the same speed .",
    "we call those fronts enslaved phase - separation fronts . in the opposite case",
    ", the phase - separation front will not keep up with the control parameter front .",
    "this then results in a free phase - separation front moving into an unstable medium .",
    "this special case has received a significant amount of attention and a good review is given by saarloos @xcite .",
    "enslaved phase - separation fronts give rise to a host of complicated phenomena , as witnessed by the large variety of morphologies formed .",
    "for example , those formed by the previously mentioned immersion precipitation membranes @xcite .",
    "these morphologies are found to depend strongly on processing conditions which correspond to different shapes and speeds of the control parameter fronts .",
    "this is why we initially focus on the simplest example of enslaved phase - separation fronts . here",
    "we consider only one - dimensional abrupt ( _ i.e. _ not spatially extended ) control parameter fronts in binary mixtures .",
    "this already gives rise to unexpected and non - trivial behavior as explained below .",
    "in particular it is noteworthy that large domains can be formed efficiently , even though such domain sizes are practically unobtainable through homogeneous phase - separation in one - dimensional systems .    in the next section we review the theory of spinodal decomposition , as it is relevant to the understanding of the dynamics of phase - separation at the front .",
    "we then define our model which consists of a cahn - hilliard equation with an underlying @xmath0 free energy .",
    "the control parameter front enters though the time and space dependence of the parameters in the free energy .",
    "we expect the details of the phase - separation dynamics to depend strongly on the shape of the control parameter profile and its dynamics . to simplify our analysis in this paper we focus on the simplest case consisting of a control parameter front which is a sharp step moving with a constant velocity . to numerically explore the dynamics of this model",
    "we developed a lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) simulation .",
    "generic results of these simulations elucidate the general behavior of an enslaved phase - separation front . as the control parameter front advances into the mixed region , phase - separation ensues .",
    "excess material is then diffused both ahead of the front and through the forming domain into the next domain .",
    "this continues until switching occurs and a new domain of the opposite kind is formed .",
    "this is a regular process that repeats , resulting in regular domains after a few cycles .    to predict the morphology we only need to find the dependence of this one length - scale as a function of the nondimensional parameters of the equation of motion . despite its apparent simplicity",
    "this is still a non - trivial problem .",
    "we show that this can be done analytically in the case where the mobility ahead of the front is negligible and the front is moving very slowly .",
    "the main ingredients in the analytical solution are solving for the time dependence of the concentration right behind the front and the condition for the switching to a new domain .",
    "together , those allow us to determine the switching time and hence the domain size .    using the results from this special case as a foundation",
    ", we examined more general enslaved fronts . when we investigated the effect of non - zero mobility ahead of the front we observed that the domain - size has an unexpected non - monotonic dependence on the mobility .",
    "we were able to qualitatively explain this behavior as a competition of the diffusive deposition of material ahead of the front and the switching condition .    with satisfactory results for this model in one dimension",
    ", we conclude with a discussion of possible extensions such as using the front speed to imprint a domain pattern , and a roadmap of future research of enslaved front systems .",
    "as previously mentioned , phase - separation occurs after some physical control parameter , such as temperature , changes so that the system becomes thermodynamically unstable .",
    "the system forms two or more distinct coexisting phases , and the property which distinguishes the phases is called the order parameter .",
    "we are concerned with systems that transition from a one - phase state to a two - phase state as a control parameter is varied .",
    "despite the fact that most theoretical work on phase - separation has focused on the homogeneous case , most practical cases exhibit phase - separation that does not occur everywhere - at - once , but starts at one or more initial points and spreads through the system .",
    "the boundary between phase separated and non phase separated material is called the phase - separation front .",
    "likewise , when the control parameter changes inhomogeneously we refer to the boundary between the single phase and two - phase regions as the control parameter front .",
    "the correlation of the phase - separation front and the control parameter front depends on the exact nature of the dynamics of the control parameter .",
    "consider a binary mixture of @xmath1-type and @xmath2-type material described by the free energy : @xmath3 \\;.",
    "\\label{free_energy}\\ ] ] this is a general fourth - order expansion of more specific free energy expressions . the cubic term which would normally appear has been scaled away , without loss of generality , by choosing the critical concentration to be zero .",
    "the @xmath4 parameter , which can usually be neglected , can matter here because it may take different values on either side of the control parameter front .",
    "the dynamics of phase - separation is diffusive and is described by the cahn - hilliard equation @xmath5 where the chemical potential is derived from the free energy as @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the control parameter that determines the stability of the system ; @xmath8 corresponds to the one - phase region and @xmath9 corresponds to the two - phase region .",
    "the order parameter @xmath10 is the concentration of the two component materials . for homogeneous parameters",
    "the linear @xmath4 term can be neglected because it does not change the equilibrium properties or the dynamics of homogeneous systems . however , when @xmath11 it will introduce chemical potential gradients between the material on either side of the control parameter front . of the other parameters ,",
    "@xmath12 is the mobility , @xmath13 determines the interfacial energy cost , and the amplitude of the non - linear term @xmath14 determines the equilibrium values of the order parameter : @xmath15    we now discuss different phase - separation mechanisms described by this model .",
    "if the control parameter does change rapidly everywhere at once  the well studied homogeneous quench  no control parameter front exists .",
    "if the system is also homogeneous in composition a phase - separation front will not form , in which case phase - separation occurs via spinodal decomposition or nucleation .",
    "another interesting situation occurs when the control parameter is changed homogeneously but gradually .",
    "in such a situation , cascades of sequential phase - separation events are observed , as shown in the work of vollmer _ et al .",
    "such phenomena are probably also exhibited for extremely extended enslaved control parameter fronts but are outside the scope of the current paper .    in the case of a homogeneous quench , typically spinodal decomposition is observed .",
    "it manifests itself in an exponential change of the order - parameter from initial fluctuations towards one of the two equilibrium values .",
    "the growth rate depends on the fluctuation s wavelength , and the fastest growing wavelength will outgrow the others and quickly dominate the morphology .",
    "this fastest growing wavelength is called the spinodal wavelength , denoted @xmath16 .",
    "though it is not often discussed in the analysis of homogeneous quenches , we refer to the reciprocal of the fastest growth rate as the spinodal time , denoted @xmath17 .",
    "to derive the spinodal wavelength and time one performs a linear expansion of the cahn - hilliard equation around the initial concentration @xmath18 , then fourier transforms this linearized cahn - hilliard equation into @xmath19-space which results in the ode : @xmath20 \\tilde{\\phi}(k ) = r(k)\\tilde{\\phi}(k ) \\;.\\ ] ] the solution of this equation is the exponential growth of fluctuations where the growth rate depends on the angular wavenumber @xmath19 : @xmath21 the angular wavenumber with the fastest growth rate corresponds to the spinodal wavelength : @xmath22 the fastest growth rate corresponds to the spinodal time : @xmath23 such a morphology , with an initial domain wavelength of @xmath16 , will coarsen to larger length - scales , but the process is inefficient in one dimension since it obeys a logarithmic growth law @xmath24 at late times @xcite .",
    "therefore it is hard to form large structures in a finite time .    from the spinodal wavelength and time",
    "we define a spinodal speed @xmath25 which can be thought of as a natural speed of phase - separation .",
    "this is important to our later analysis of the dynamics of enslaved phase - separation fronts because it allows us to define a nondimensional front speed .",
    "phase - separation fronts can form if a system has become unstable due to a sudden homogeneous control parameter change and a front is nucleated .",
    "this can occur if a defect causes local phase - separation to occur much more rapidly than through spinodal decomposition . from this defect",
    "a front spreads through the system .",
    "et al . _ performed an analysis of the speed of such fronts for many different types of systems . for a conserved order parameter system described by the cahn - hilliard equation with @xmath26 and @xmath27 ,",
    "the speed of the front , which they call the linear spreading speed , is : @xmath28 the initial domain wavelength is found to be smaller than the spinodal wavelength @xmath29 and the morphology then coarsens in time @xcite .",
    "freely propagating phase - separation fronts can also form as a special case in a system with a control parameter front .",
    "if the control parameter front moves at a speed @xmath30 , this can result in the suppression of spontaneous spinodal decomposition , yet not inhibit the advancement of a freely propagating phase - separation front .",
    "however , if the control - parameter is moving slower than the linear spreading speed @xmath31 , the phase - separation front can not propagate freely and becomes enslaved by the control parameter front .    the nature of a control parameter front highly depends on the particulars of the physical system .",
    "for instance , if temperature is the control parameter of a long binary metal alloy rod which is being cooled from one end , the control parameter front will resemble the familiar error - function solution of the heat - diffusion equation .",
    "however , if the same rod is being extruded from a hot oven into a cooling environment , the control parameter front will be a much sharper transition .",
    "the shape and speed of the control parameter front will have an impact on the morphology formed in the wake of the front . in this paper",
    "we focus on phase - separation fronts enslaved by an abrupt control parameter front moving with a constant velocity .",
    "this abrupt control parameter front will be represented by a step function for the parameters in the free energy and the mobility in the cahn hilliard equation .",
    "we now introduce a lattice boltzmann method to numerically investigate this system .",
    "we will see that this control - parameter front induces phase - separation dynamics which is confined to a limited region around the front .",
    "consequently we can reduce the computational cost by focusing on a narrow region around the front .",
    "as we mentioned above , the dynamically important region for this model is restricted to a narrow area around the front .",
    "so rather than simulate a stationary system with a front moving through it , we consider the equivalent case of material advected with velocity @xmath32 past a stationary phase - separation front .",
    "this allows us to use a much smaller simulation size .",
    "this changes the diffusive equation of motion to the advection - diffusion equation @xmath33 where @xmath32 was the constant phase - separation front speed , which now appears as the material advection speed .",
    "the parameters which define the abrupt control parameter front are @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the heaviside step function and @xmath36 is the position of the front .",
    "our naming convention uses the subscript @xmath37 to denote the mixing region ahead of the control parameter front , and the subscript @xmath38 to denote the separating region behind the control parameter front .",
    "the lbm implementation of the advection - diffusion equation is similar to that of the ordinary diffusion equation , however the key differences of an advecting material with spatially dependent parameters warrents further clarification .    the standard lattice boltzmann equation with the bgk approximation is @xmath39\\ ; ,      \\label{eqn : lbe}\\ ] ] for discrete integer time , and a finite set of discrete velocities @xmath40 defined such that @xmath41 and @xmath42 are sites on the spatial lattice . to determine the macroscopic evolution equation for this model we define a continuous @xmath43 , and expand the first term to second order in a taylor series as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the total derivative operator : @xmath46 this allows us to rewrite eq .",
    "as @xmath47 and to first order we obtain : @xmath48 with repeated use of eq .   to replace @xmath49 in eq .   with the local equilibrium functions .",
    "the hydrodynamic limit of the lattice boltzmann equation then becomes @xmath50 with the implicit generalization that that @xmath51 .",
    "we then define the equilibrium moments @xmath52 corresponding to a conserved order parameter and a current of @xmath53 . summing up",
    "the taylor expanded lbe over @xmath54 we obtain the equation of motion @xmath55 this is eq .",
    "to second order , with the addition of a parameter @xmath56 which allows for rescaling simulation time .",
    "the ability to scale simulation time allows us to trade computational speed for enhanced numerical stability and improved galilean invariance @xcite . in this formulation the mobility @xmath12 is given by : @xmath57 in one dimension we use three discreet velocities @xmath58 which define the set of equilibrium distributions @xmath59 these equilibrium moments are then used with eq .   to calculate the time evolution of the system .",
    "we now have to pay the cost for smaller simulation size allowed by fixing the position of the front in terms of more complicated inflow and outflow boundary conditions .",
    "to represent a front moving in the positive @xmath41 direction we define @xmath60 which moves the material from right to left past the stationary front .",
    "this defines a fixed inflow boundary at @xmath61 and free outflow boundary at @xmath62 .",
    "our inflow boundary condition is then given by @xmath63 which ensures a constant material influx @xmath64 .",
    "on the other end of the simulation we have a free advection outflow boundary condition @xmath65 ensuring an outflow of @xmath66 .",
    "both boundary conditions are implemented as the densities are advected .",
    "the boundary conditions are open and therefore the total integral of the order - parameter is not conserved . to calculate the derivatives of the concentration required for the calculation of @xmath67 in eq .",
    "at the boundaries , we define the concentrations outside the lattice to be @xmath68 this fully defines our lattice boltzmann method .",
    "our main purpose is to predict the final morphology formed by enslaved phase - separation fronts . in fig .",
    "[ timelapse ] we show the evolution of the phase - separation front and we see that only regular alternating domains are formed .",
    "thus , the final morphology is fully characterized by the length of the domains formed as a function of the parameters : @xmath69 however , not all of these parameters are independent . to reduce the number of free parameters we define the following nondimensional scales : @xmath70 here",
    "the length and time are scaled by their spinodal values , and the concentration is scaled by the positive equilibrium concentration of the separated material .",
    "in contrast with homogeneous quench spinodal decomposition and free - front propagation , the initial nondimensional concentration ( @xmath18 ) does not play a meaningful roll in the scaling of the dynamics of phase - separation for enslaved front systems .",
    "we therefore set @xmath71 for the definition of spinodal wavelength in eq .   and",
    "spinodal time in eq .   used for nondimensionalization .",
    "when we apply these nondimensionalizations to the equation of motion we obtain : @xmath72 this leaves us with the following dimensionless parameters : @xmath73    the main effect of @xmath74 is to renormalize @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and the additional nonlinear effects can typically be neglected unless the concentration varies substantially in the mixing region .",
    "we therefore consider @xmath77 an irrelevant nondimensional parameter and choose it to be zero .",
    "we choose @xmath78 in such a way as to avoid bulk chemical potential differences between the mixed and separated regions @xmath79 , and we obtain @xmath80 additionally , we do not consider changes in the interfacial free energy cost across the front , and therefore set @xmath81 .",
    "this results in a nondimensional domain wavelength which is a function of four nondimensional parameters : @xmath82    to investigate the dependence of @xmath83 on @xmath84 we first turn to numerical simulations .",
    "let us first consider a generic simulation to discuss the main features of morphology formation .",
    "the result of one simulation using this one - dimensional lbm implementation is shown in fig .",
    "[ timelapse ] as a space - time plot of concentration and chemical potential .",
    "it is clear from this plot that the dynamics of phase - separation is limited to the region around the front , and the chemical potential away from the front is flat .",
    "this simulation started with equal parts @xmath1-type and @xmath2-type material in the mixed region , and the @xmath1 and @xmath2 domains formed after the front passed are therefore of equal size .",
    "we shall now examine the domain formation using the middle @xmath1-type domain in fig .",
    "[ timelapse ] as an example .",
    "three key events in the formation of this domain are marked a , b , and c. at point a the domain is nucleated .",
    "the concentration plot shows a very narrow domain and the chemical potential plot shows the previous peak collapsing toward a flat profile .",
    "the domain there expands as it is pulled along with the front . to grow this domain ,",
    "@xmath2-type material must be transported away . from the gradient on the chemical potential",
    "we see that most of this material is pulled across and deposited on the back of the domain , which advances the back interface of the domain .",
    "some of the rest is pushed ahead of the front , and a small amount builds up on the forming domain just behind the front .",
    "these last two depositions have the effect of making the forming domain increasingly unstable as the concentration at the front increasingly deviates from the equilibrium concentration .",
    "to maintain the currents of material away from the interface , the chemical potential gradients must be maintained .",
    "therefore the trough in the chemical potential deepens .    at point",
    "b the @xmath1-type domain has just detached from the front as a new @xmath2-type domain has been nucleated .",
    "the chemical potential very quickly becomes flat across the newly detached @xmath1-type domain as it fully separates to the positive equilibrium concentration .",
    "however , the formation of a @xmath2-type domain at the front causes @xmath1-type material to be deposited on the leading edge of the detached domain , thereby expanding it .",
    "the interface between the @xmath1-type domain and the new @xmath2-type gets pulled along by the front , but is moving with about half the front s speed .",
    "the rate of deposition of material on this moving interface is nearly constant as revealed by the almost constant linear slope of the chemical potential .",
    "point c marks the end of the formation of the domain by the enslaved phase - separation front as yet another domain is nucleated .",
    "the chemical potential curve has become flat immediately adjacent to the domain , and all material currents to the interfaces have stopped .",
    "the domain is now completely stationary . because the domains are highly ordered and much larger than the interface width , they do not evolve further at any appreciable rate @xcite .",
    "we now qualitatively understand how the morphology is formed by a one - dimensional enslaved front . to make quantitative statements we need to measure the relevant quantities from the lbm simulations of our model .",
    "the sizes of domains formed are found numerically by determining the length between zero - crossings of the concentration . to find the zero - crossing point to sub - lattice precision we linearly interpolate between the two lattice sites on either side of the crossing .",
    "the first two domains after the control parameter front are still forming and expanding , therefore domain length measurements begin at the third zero - crossing behind the front and is an average of two or more domains . to ensure that there are enough fully - formed domains , we dynamically grow the simulation to always keep the number of interfaces behind the front greater than those used to calculate a meaningful average .",
    "the measurement is recorded once the uncertainty in the domain length is both less than one lattice spacing , and less than one thousandth the domain length itself . to more directly compare our enslaved front system to previous work , we double the domain size to find the domain wavelength . for asymmetric ( @xmath85 ) the domain size is multivalued and may lead to some confusion . in this paper , however , we only present domain wavelength measurements for symmetricly mixed material .",
    "in addition to the sizes of domains formed , we need to know the time - dependent concentration of the partially phase - separated material near the front .",
    "we can not simply measure the concentration at the front , as it would always be near zero due to the interface there .",
    "however , since the chemical potential is continuous across the front we can invert the bulk chemical potential ( defined as eq .   for @xmath86 ) to find the relevant concentration .",
    "as shown in the timelapse plots of fig .",
    "[ timelapse ] , the chemical potential has a local extremum at the location of the control parameter front .",
    "the chemical potential value we use to find the near - front concentration is the interlattice extremum value of a polynomial fitted to the three most - extreme values near the front .",
    "since it is the speed of the control parameter front that determines whether the phase - separation front is enslaved , and for many physical systems the front speed may vary over time , it seems natural to first observe how the front speed determines the size of domains .",
    "in addition , the interfacial free energy cost @xmath13 plays an important roll in determining homogeneous and free - front length scales .",
    "therefore its effect on domain size will also be investigated .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ univscaling_a ] , domains get larger the slower the front becomes . also evident is that the larger the domains become the smaller the effect from the interfacial free energy , and that for slow enough front speeds the effect would become negligible .",
    "however , we know from our nondimensionalization of the equation of motion that all dependence on the interfacial energy cost should scale away completely , but only if the simulation is capable of faithfully reproducing the equation of motion . in fig .",
    "[ univscaling_b ] the nondimensional rescaling of the top plot is shown , revealing an impressive data collapse onto a single curve .    the data collapse provided by the nondimensionalization , though not unexpected ,",
    "is very encouraging .",
    "we can be confident that the appropriate parameters for continued investigation of this model are those revealed in eq .   by the nondimensionalization procedure . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we investigate the dependence of the domain wavelength on the nondimensional parameters given in eq .  .",
    "we now analytically investigate a situation where the nondimensional front speed @xmath84 is the only relevant nondimensional parameter .",
    "to develop an analytical theory of domain formation we focus on the special case of @xmath87 , where there is no dynamics in the mixed material ahead of the front .",
    "this reduces the relevant parameters to just the enslaved front speed @xmath84 .",
    "all other dimensionless parameters are irrelevant since there is no dynamics ahead of the front . due to its simplicity",
    ", this system lends itself especially well to an analytical approach .",
    "we will predict the resultant morphology ( domain wavelengths ) by explicitly solving the dynamics of phase - separation at the front . we accomplish this in two parts :",
    "determine the time - dependence of the concentration just behind the front , and find the concentration at which a new domain will nucleate . by combining these two results",
    "we find the switching time @xmath88 , and thus the domain wavelength : @xmath89    to numerically verify our analytical results we can not simply set the mobility of the mixed region to zero .",
    "this would require that @xmath90 , which would lead to an unstable simulation @xcite .",
    "instead , the @xmath87 case is implemented by placing the control parameter front at the positive boundary , and defining the off - lattice concentration as @xmath18 .",
    "the lambert  w function appears in the solution for an enslaved front with @xmath91 for @xmath92 . ]    .",
    "note that the fast phase - separation front speed simulation shows marked deviation from the theoretical curve , as expected . also note that the concentration at which the domain switches ( @xmath93 ) does not seem to depend on front speed .",
    "inset shows the full theoretical curve , though concentration should never go below @xmath94 as that is unconditionally unstable and would immediately undergo spinodal decomposition .",
    "while not essential to this analysis , zero concentration occurs for @xmath95 . ]    to determine the time evolution of the concentration at the phase - separation front we examine the current of material into and out of the domain interface formed at the front .",
    "we first assume the interface to be sharp by comparison to the size of the domain forming at the phase - separation front . from the definition of the nondimensional speed @xmath84 in eq .",
    "we can see that @xmath96 .",
    "thus a vanishing cost of interfacial free energy ( @xmath97 ) is equivalent to assuming the front speed is much slower than the spinodal velocity , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath98 .",
    "this assumption of a slow front speed is not especially limiting to our analysis as we are primarily interested in the formation of large stable structures ; unlike those found for front speeds approaching the free - front speed @xmath99 which are small and rapidly coarsen @xcite .",
    "the buildup rate of material in a region is @xmath100 where the current @xmath101 at a point is determined by the gradient of the chemical potential : @xmath102 we re interested in the region of the interface forming directly behind the front at position @xmath103 .",
    "since that region is vanishingly small , the rate of material deposited there can be written as a difference of the chemical potential gradients on either side of the front @xmath104 since the mobility ahead of the front is zero , the time dependent rate of deposition for the interface forming at the front is : @xmath105 the gradient of the chemical potential across the entire forming domain is nearly constant , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ timelapse ] .",
    "this means that material pulled behind the front is transported all the way across the forming domain and deposited on the second domain .",
    "any deviation from a linear profile of the chemical potential is of order @xmath106 , as can be seen from the cahn - hilliard equation and the fact that @xmath107 is nearly stationary inside the forming domain .",
    "the value of the chemical potential at the phase - separation front @xmath108 changes with time , but the chemical potential at the other end of the domain is zero .",
    "we can therefore write the chemical potential gradient as @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the width of the domain forming at the phase - separation front .",
    "the interface at the phase - separation front moves with the front , expanding the domain forming behind it .",
    "this requires that the rate of material deposited into the phase - separation front interface be equal to the difference in concentration across the interface times the front speed @xmath111 \\ ; ,      \\label{eqn : current2}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the ( dimensional ) front speed , @xmath112 is the concentration at the phase - separation front , and @xmath18 is the mixed - material concentration .",
    "the @xmath87 condition means that none of the wrong - type material can be pushed ahead of the phase - separation front ; instead it must be transfered across and deposited behind the forming domain .",
    "this results in the expansion of the second domain by moving the interface at a speed @xmath113 which trails the phase - separation front . taking this into account , and using an argument similar to the one used to derive eq .",
    ", we can write another expression for the rate of material deposition behind the front in terms of material removed and transported to the second interface . we obtain @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the change in concentration across the fully formed interface , and @xmath116 is the equilibrium concentration given by eq .  .",
    "for now we ll continue to write @xmath116 , and eliminate the variable later through nondimensionalization .",
    "the width of the first domain is found by integrating over time the relative speeds of the interfaces at both ends of the domain @xmath117 where we eliminated @xmath118 by combining eq .",
    "and eq .  .",
    "we then combine eq .   with eq .  ,",

    "we have already seen from the analytical result for @xmath87 in the limit as @xmath173 that the domain wavelength is proportional to the inverse of the front speed ( @xmath174 ) which matches the previous scaling argument for the opposite case of @xmath175 .",

    "the control parameter in either a purely mixed ( @xmath183 ) or purely separating ( @xmath184 ) system is usually not a function of position and can be absorbed into the mobility .",
    "in fact , if we were to consider the mixing region ahead of the front as being entirely detached from the separating region behind the front , we would be able to completely nondimensionalize away all free parameters , resulting in separate scale - invariant equations of motion .",
    "however , due to the shared boundary at the front linking the two regions , the change of the control parameter @xmath152 across the front can not be ignored .",
    "this means that changing the control parameter ratio @xmath152 has different consequences for the resulting morphology than does changing the mobility ratio @xmath37 .",
    "the first consequence of changing the order parameter @xmath152 has for the dynamics of phase - separation is for the material which gets pushed ahead of the control parameter front .",
    "recall that the chemical potential is continuous across the front ( @xmath185 ) . ignoring for the moment the interfacial contribution to the chemical potential , we can write the continuity of the the chemical potential as @xmath186 this means that the concentration just ahead of the front and the concentration just behind the front are tied together .",
    "this is important because the switching condition , even for very large @xmath37 , is partly dependent on the concentration of material just ahead of the front . for @xmath187 ,",
    "the concentration ahead of the front becomes larger , causing the switching concentration to approach the equilibrium concentration , resulting in very early switching . on the other hand , for @xmath188",
    "the concentration ahead of the front becomes close to the symmetrically mixed concentration , resulting in switching taking longer to occur .    if we simply use @xmath189 in eq .",

    "we have shown that , complex though the subject may be , certain important aspects of enslaved phase - separation fronts can be understood well enough to theoretically predict the morphology .    using our model of a binary mixture with an abrupt control parameter front , we were able to determine the effect of all relevant free parameters on the size of domains formed in a 1d system .",

    "we were able to reduce the number of relevant parameters from twelve to four .",

    "analytical solutions are few and far between for the theory of morphology formation . choosing the nondimensional front speed as the primary parameter of interest , we consider the radical simplification of a front moving into material which has no mixed - material dynamics .",

    "the former is understood by an extension of the switching condition , and the later is explained by a simple scaling argument ; when the mobility in the mixing region is much greater than separating region , the domain wavelength formed by the front should scale with the same dependence as the length scale in the mixing region .",
    "this argument resulted in the discovery that , for very slow front speeds , there is a single universal scaling curve of the nondimensional domain wavelength as a function of the nondimensional mobility and front speed .",

    "also , dimensionalities of two and higher allow hydrodynamics to play a roll in the phase - separation dynamics . in three - dimensions",
    ", enslaved fronts can induce a rich family of morphologies depending on the properties of the material and the front .",
    "perhaps the most intriguing possibility is to be able to control the material and front well enough to reliably switch morphologies during front traversal , resulting in highly - ordered , highly - inhomogeneous composite materials .",
    "what also remains is to examine more general enslaved fronts .",
    "the most straightforward extension is to attempt to develop an analytical solution to the abrupt one - dimensional enslaved front for all three free parameters @xmath84 , @xmath152 , and @xmath37 . a careful accounting of the additional currents cased by dynamics ahead of the front should allow an extension of the differential equation describing the dynamics at the front , presented in eq .",
    ", for this more general abrupt one - dimensional enslaved front .    then we will relax the condition of an abrupt control parameter front to obtain an extended front .",
    "we expect that there will be little change while the width of an extended control parameter front is on the order of the interface width , but extended fronts which approach the size of the forming domain may result in new and interesting phase - separation dynamics , even in 1d ."
