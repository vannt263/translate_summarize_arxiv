    "the challenges of solid - state theory are to qualitatively understand material s properties and to calculate these , quantitatively and reliably .",
    "this task is particularly difficult if electronic correlations are as strong as they are in many materials containing transition and rare - earth elements . here",
    ", the coulomb interactions between the valence electrons in @xmath0- and @xmath1-orbitals can be strong .",
    "the reason for this difficulty is that the standard approach , the _ local _ density approximation ( lda ) @xcite , for calculating material s properties relies on the electronic correlations in jellium , a weakly correlated system . for more correlated materials , the electronic density is strongly varying and the assumption of a constant density for treating exchange and correlation",
    "is not warranted .",
    "that is , the exact functional of density - functional theory @xcite , which -if known- would allow the treatment of correlated materials , is certainly _ non - local_. another difficulty is the construction of functionals beyond ground - state properties , e.g. , for spectral properties .",
    "in this situation , we have seen a break - through brought about by a new method , lda+dmft @xcite , which merges lda with dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite to account for the electronic correlations . this approach has been developed in an effort by theoreticians from the bandstructure and the many - body communities joining two of the most successful approaches of their respective community . by now , lda+dmft has been successfully employed to calculate spectral , transport , and thermodynamic properties of various transition - metal oxides , magnetic transition metals , and rare - earth metals such as ce and pu ; see @xcite for reviews .",
    "depending on the strength of the coulomb interaction , lda+dmft gives a weakly correlated metal as in lda , a strongly correlated metal , or an insulator as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldaldadmftldau ] .    in the following section",
    ", we will introduce this method by the example of a particular material currently of immense interest : the colossal - magnetoresistance ( cmr ) material , lamno@xmath2 .",
    "results for the parent compound @xcite , as well as for doped manganites cmrldadmft are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] , we conclude and discuss the pros and cons of lda+dmft .",
    "the first step of an lda+dmft calculation is the calculation of the lda bandstructure .",
    "this paramagnetic bandstructure for our lamno@xmath2 example is shown at the top of fig .",
    "[ fig : ldadmft ] for the ideal cubic structure .",
    "we employed the @xmath3th order muffin - tin orbital ( nmto ) basis set @xcite .",
    "as we will later restrict the electronic correlations to the strongly interacting , more localized @xmath0-and @xmath1-orbitals , we need to identify these orbitals in the lda calculation . in the case of lamno@xmath2 where each mn@xmath4 ion is in the nearly cubic environment at the centre of an oxygen octahedron ,",
    "these are the three lower - lying @xmath5 and the two higher lying @xmath6 ( 3@xmath0 ) orbitals . since mn@xmath4 has the @xmath7 configuration , the first three @xmath0 electrons occupy the @xmath5 orbitals forming a spin @xmath8 according to hund s rule .",
    "this leaves us with one electron per mn in the two @xmath6 orbitals . with a @xmath9 mean - field occupation ( lsda or lda+u )",
    ", only the @xmath10-like lda bands would cross the fermi level . for transition - metal oxides ,",
    "one typically -in present day lda+dmft calculations- restricts the dmft calculation to the low - energy bands crossing the fermi level . here , we employ nmto downfolding @xcite for obtaining the effective lda hamiltonian for two mn @xmath6 orbitals , labeled @xmath11 and @xmath12 in fig .  [",
    "fig : ldadmft ] .",
    "this hamiltonian cmrldadmft can be written in terms of the @xmath13 orbital matrix @xmath14 whose diagonalization gives the lda bandstructure , see first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ldadmft ] ) .",
    "in other calculations , e.g. , for ce @xcite , all ( @xmath15 ) valence orbitals have been taken into account . as shown in the top part of fig .",
    "[ fig : ldadmft ] , the downfolded hamiltonian ( red bands ) describes the lda bandstructure of the lamno@xmath2 @xmath6 orbitals very well .",
    "if other basis sets , such as plane waves , are used , the construction of a minimal set of well localized orbitals can be more involved .",
    "but this is also possible , e.g. ,  through wannier - function projection @xcite .",
    "* lda+dmft in a nutshell *    * 1 ) * calculation @xmath16",
    "@xmath17        the second step of an lda+dmft calculation is to supplement the lda hamiltonian by the local coulomb interaction which is responsible for the electronic correlations , see second part of fig .",
    "[ fig : ldadmft ] . in general , the coulomb interactions can be expressed , e.g. , by racah parameters @xcite . in actual calculations",
    "however , this term has been hitherto restricted to the inter - orbital coulomb interaction @xmath18 and hund s exchange @xmath19 ( there is also a pair hopping term of the same size ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ldadmft ] top part , right hand side . the intra - orbital coulomb interaction @xmath20 follows by symmetry . for a parameter - free (",
    "_ ab initio _ ) calculation , the ( screened ) coulomb interactions have to be determined . as lda+dmft calculations for a prototype transition - metal oxide , srvo@xmath2 @xcite , and a prototype rare - earth metal , ce @xcite , showed , such _ ab initio _",
    "lda+dmft calculations employing the constrained lda @xcite for determining @xmath18 and @xmath19 work very well .",
    "there is some uncertainty of @xmath21ev @xcite in @xmath18 due to the ambiguity in defining the @xmath0 orbitals , leading to an additional error besides the lda and dmft approximations involved .",
    "this can be a problem if one is close to a transition and hence sensitive to small changes of @xmath18 , as is e.g.  the case for v@xmath22o@xmath2 @xcite which is close to a mott - hubbard transition . but usually results do not alter dramatically upon changing @xmath18 by @xmath23ev @xcite .    in the case of lamno@xmath2 ,",
    "the half - occupied @xmath5 orbitals prevent us from using standard constrained lda calculations .",
    "hence , we took the @xmath24ev value from the literature @xcite and @xmath25ev from the spin - up / spin - down splitting of a ferromagnetic lsda calculation . in the following ,",
    "the three @xmath5 electrons are taken into account as a ( classical ) spin-@xmath8 , coupled through hund s exchange @xmath26 to the @xmath6 spin , see the second term of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ldadmft ] ) in fig .  [",
    "fig : ldadmft ] .",
    "the third step of the lda+dmft calculation is to employ dmft for solving the many - body hamiltonian ( [ eq : ldadmft ] ) .",
    "had we used the unrestricted hartree - fock ( static mean - field ) approximation instead , we would have the lda+@xmath27 approach @xcite .",
    "in dmft , we replace the coulomb interaction on all sites , but one , by a self - energy .",
    "electrons interact on this single site and still move through the whole lattice . however , on the other sites , they propagate through the medium given by the self - energy instead of the interaction .",
    "this is the dmft approximation , which hence neglects non - local vertex contributions .",
    "the emerging dmft single - site problem is equivalent to an auxiliary anderson impurity model @xcite which has to be solved self - consistently together with the standard relation ( dyson eq . ) between self energy and green function .",
    "dmft becomes exact @xcite if the number of neighbors @xmath28 and is a good approximation for a three dimensional system with many neighboring lattice sites .",
    "in particular , it provides for an accurate description of the major contribution of electronic correlation : the local correlations between two @xmath0- or @xmath1-electrons on the same site . for more details on dmft ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "if the electron density changes after the dmft calculation , we have to go back to the first step and recalculate the lda hamiltonian for this new density .",
    "in contrast to the frequency - dependent spectral function , the electron density itself however only changes to a lesser degree .",
    "this self - consistency is therefore often left out .",
    "an alternative point of view , besides the above - mentioned hamiltonian one , is the spectral density - functional theory @xcite .",
    "this theory states that the ground state energy @xmath29 $ ] is a functional which depends not only on the electron density @xmath30 but also on the local green function ( spectral function ) @xmath31 .",
    "lda+dmft is an approximation to this , in principle exact functional , in the same spirit as the lda is to the exact density functional .",
    "let us now turn to the results obtained for lamno@xmath2 . fig .",
    "[ fig : bands ] compares lda , lda+@xmath27 and lda+dmft results for the real jahn - teller- and gdfeo@xmath2-distorted , orthorhombic crystal structure at 0  gpa and 11  gpa , as well as for an artificial cubic structure with the same volume as at 0  gpa .     as obtained in lda ( top ) , lda+u ( center ) , and lda+dmft ( bottom ; @xmath32-integrated spectrum ) for the experimental ( orthorhombic ) crystal structure at 0 gpa ( right ) ,",
    "11gpa ( center ) and an artificial cubic structure with the same volume as at 0gpa ( left ) .",
    "energies are in ev with the fermi energy being 0 ; the unit of @xmath33 is @xmath34 .",
    "for the correct insulating behavior and size of the gap , both coulomb correlations and the crystal field splitting due to the orthorhombic distortion are needed ( bottom right ) . for more details",
    "see lamno3ldadmft , from which this figure was reproduced . ]",
    "all lda hamiltonians were calculated for the paramagnetic phase , which is the stable one at 300  k. even though the lattice distortion leads to a crystal - field splitting of the two @xmath6 bands in the lda , these bands still overlap .",
    "hence , without electronic correlations , _",
    "i.e. _ without @xmath18 , the plain vanilla lda predicts a metal ; it can not describe the insulating paramagnet observed experimentally .",
    "if we now consider the many - body hamiltonian ( [ eq : ldadmft ] ) and treat it in the unrestricted hartree - fock approximation , we obtain the lda+@xmath27 bands shown in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bands ] .",
    "we see that the crystal - field splitting becomes largely enhanced with the result that lamno@xmath2 becomes an insulator , even in the cubic phase at compressions exceeding those for which the material is experimentally known to be metallic @xcite .",
    "however , such effects are overestimated in the lda+@xmath27 approximation .",
    "we therefore turn to lda+dmft which does a better job in this respect . in the cubic phase , and even at normal pressure , lda+dmft yields metallic behavior .",
    "hence , both coulomb interaction and crystal - field splitting are necessary and work hand in hand to make lamno@xmath2 insulating at normal pressure .",
    "the resulting gap is slightly smaller than 2  ev as in experiment .",
    "our lda+dmft calculations show that for lamno@xmath2 to be metallic at pressures above the experimental 32 gpa , some distortion must persist . for further details ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "most fascinating , both from the point of view of basic physics and of materials engineering , is the colossalmagnetoresistance @xcite of doped manganites such as la@xmath35sr@xmath36mno@xmath2 . at low temperatures , doped manganites are bad - metallic ferromagnets , whereas at high temperatures , they are insulating lamno3,okimoto95a for a wide range of doping .",
    "since sr dopes holes in lamno@xmath2 , one would generally expect a metallic behavior . as the lattice distortion fades away upon doping",
    ", we can start from a cubic crystal structure , for which the nearest - neighbor tight - binding hopping gives already an accurate description of the lda bandstructure , as shown in lamno3ldadmft . even without the static lattice distortion",
    ", we must however include the distortion in the form of phonons .",
    "we do so by the two jahn - teller phonons coupled to the @xmath6 electrons through the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath37 .",
    "sr@xmath38mno@xmath39 ( @xmath40 electrons / site ) .",
    "the dotted line shows a metallic drude peak in the absence of electron - phonon coupling ; the dashed line the ` bad ' metallic behavior in the ferromagnetic phase ( fm ) at @xmath41.inset : in the pm ( fm ) phase , the resistivity shows insulating ( ` bad ' metallic ) behavior so that the application of a magnetic field results in a `` colossal '' magnetoresistance.[fig : cmr ] , width=170 ]    sr@xmath38mno@xmath39 ( @xmath40 electrons / site ) .",
    "the dotted line shows a metallic drude peak in the absence of electron - phonon coupling ; the dashed line the ` bad ' metallic behavior in the ferromagnetic phase ( fm ) at @xmath41.inset : in the pm ( fm ) phase , the resistivity shows insulating ( ` bad ' metallic ) behavior so that the application of a magnetic field results in a `` colossal '' magnetoresistance.[fig : cmr ] ]    these local holstein phonons are described by a single frequency @xmath42 . our dmft calculation ,",
    "see @xcite for details , shows again that coulomb interaction and electron - phonon coupling mutually support each other : on lattice sites with a single electron the jahn - teller coupling leads to a ( dynamic ) splitting of the two @xmath6 levels which is strongly enhanced by the coulomb interaction . in this way the electrons are localized as a lattice polaron , explaining the unusual experimental properties of doped manganites @xcite .",
    "[ fig : cmr ] shows as an example the optical conductivity and the resistivity as a function of temperature .",
    "as one can see , the paramagnet has a ( pseudo-)gap at low frequencies and is therefore insulating - like .",
    "in contrast the ferromagnet is a ( bad ) metal .",
    "since the ferromagnetic phase can be stabilized by a small magnetic field , a colossal  magnetoresistance emerges .",
    "using the example of lamno@xmath39 , we introduced the lda+dmft approach and presented some of the results obtained .",
    "let us conclude this paper , by outlining the advantages and disadvantages of lda+dmft .",
    "the most striking advantages are :    1 .",
    "we can now calculate electronic properties of _ strongly correlated 3d- and 4f - materials _ with an accuracy comparable to that of the lda for electronically weakly correlated materials .",
    "2 .   as the name _ dynamical _ mean - field theory suggests ,",
    "the _ dynamics _ of the electrons is included , as are the excited states .",
    "one always calculates the excitation spectrum .",
    "these states are effective - mass renormalizations of the lda one - particle states .",
    "actually , we even have _ two _ effective - mass renormalizations of the lda dispersion relation @xmath43 and a kink in - between @xcite . also finite life times due to the electron - electron scattering and metal - insulator transitions",
    "are included .",
    "3 .   besides the spectral function for the addition or removal of single electrons , also correlation functions can be calculated . from these two functions ,",
    "all physical quantities can be calculated : spectra , transport properties , thermodynamics .",
    "all this naturally arises from a well - defined theory without the need to construct , e.g. , from the lda an effective heisenberg model and from this , susceptibilities and critical temperatures ( see e.  g.  @xcite for such dmft calculations )    with so many advantages , there are also disadvantages :    1 .",
    "while the dmft includes the major part of the electronic correlations , i.e. , the _ local _ correlations induced by the local coulomb interaction , non - local correlations are neglected .",
    "these give rise to additional , interesting physics , typically at lower temperatures , e.g. , magnons , quantum criticality , and possibly high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "recently , cluster @xcite and diagrammatic extensions @xcite of dmft have been developed to overcome this obstacle .",
    "another drawback is the computational cost for solving the anderson impurity model .",
    "the numerical effort of the standard quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations grows as @xmath44 with a big prefactor for the monte - carlo statistics .",
    "here , @xmath45 is the number of interacting orbitals .",
    "when @xmath46 inequivalent ions with @xmath0- or @xmath1-orbitals are included in a supercell , the effort grows linearly @xmath47 .",
    "this means that typical lda+dmft calculations at room temperature require some hours on present day computers .",
    "the biggest problem is the @xmath48 increase of the computational effort .",
    "however , more recently developed qmc approaches , such as projective qmc @xcite and continuous - time qmc @xcite at least mitigate this drawback .",
    "3 .   presently , the most important point preventing the widespread application of lda+dmft in academia and in industry is the lack of standardized program packages .",
    "but the inclusion of dmft into well spread lda codes , such as , e.g. , the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite , will certainly be done in the near future .",
    "a more principle disadvantage is the need to identify the interacting @xmath0- or @xmath1-orbitals .",
    "this is cumbersome if one starts with plane waves and the result will also depend to some extent on the lda basis set employed and the procedure to define the @xmath0- or @xmath1-orbitals from these basis function , e.g. , via nmto partial - wave downfolding or via wannier - function projection .    with the pros clearly outweighing the cons , many of which have been or will be mitigated , lda+dmft or variants such as gw+dmft will be used more and more in the future for calculations of correlated materials . with lda and dmft ,",
    "bandstructure has finally met many - body theory .",
    "the next step is to meet industry .",
