    "we studied 97 field galactic bright be stars using the bcd system ( chalonge & divan 1956 , zorec & briot 1991 ) to avoid perturbations on the fundamental parameters due to the circumstellar disc .",
    "these parameters were treated for rotational effects ( frmat et al .",
    "2005 ) . from the observed parameters , called _ apparent _",
    ", we obtain first the _ parent non - rotating counterparts _ ( _ pnrc _ ) which represent homologous stars without rotation . to enter the evolutionary tracks ,",
    "we transform then the _ pnrc _ into _ averaged _ parameters over the whole stellar surface .",
    "figure 1a ) shows the distribution of points ( @xmath6 ) obtained using the original or @xmath7 fundamental parameters and the evolutionary tracks without rotation ( schaller et al .",
    "the plotted error bars correspond to measurement uncertainties .",
    "figure 1b ) shows the same type of distribution , but where parameters were corrected for rotational effects assuming rigid rotation with @xmath8 0.9 ( frmat et al . 2005 ) and models of stellar evolution with rotation calculated by meynet & maeder ( 2000 ) with zams equatorial velocity @xmath9 300 km  s@xmath10 . in both diagrams of fig . 1 , points spread over the whole interval of age fractions @xmath11 @xmath12 , which suggest that the be phenomenon may appear at whatever stage of the stellar evolution on the ms evolution phase .",
    "there is , however , a difference between the diagrams where rotation is taken into account and where it is not . if we were not aware of rotational effects , fig .",
    "1a would suggest that 86% of stars are above the @xmath13 0.5 limit .",
    "figure 1b shows , however , when fast rotation of be stars is taken into account , the fraction of stars in our sample above @xmath14 @xmath15 slumps to 62% .",
    "when we separate the stars into @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 ones ( @xmath19 ) another important result appears : we see in fig .",
    "1b that the be phenomenon in massive stars tends to appear on average at smaller @xmath0 age fractions than in the less massive stars",
    ". there is also a striking lack of low - mass be stars ( @xmath20 ) in @xmath21 .",
    "these distributions can be due to : @xmath22 ) higher mass - loss rates in massive objects , which reduce the surface fast rotation and inhibit the be phenomenon rapidly ; @xmath23 ) circulation time scales to transport angular momentum from the core to the surface , which are longer the lower the stellar mass .",
    "some of low - mass fast rotators , classified as bn stars , could then be *  becoming \" * be stars .",
