    "the search for structures in the qcd phase diagram , such as a critical point or a first order phase coexistence region has been at the forefront of strong interaction research for the last several years .",
    "most experimental and theoretical effort in this regard has concentrated on the measurement and calculation of cumulants of conserved charges , in particular of baryon number cumulants @xcite , see , e.g. , @xcite for an overview .",
    "cumulants of the particle number distribution have the advantage that they are easily accessible in finite temperature field theory since they are simply given by derivatives of the free energy with respect to an appropriate chemical potential",
    ". however they have the disadvantage that they mix correlations of different order .",
    "for example in case of a system of uncorrelated particles of one species , say protons , governed by the poisson distribution , all cumulants are given by the mean number of particles , @xmath0 for all @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , for system of uncorrelated resonances which decay in two particles , the cumulants are simply given by @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the average number of resonances .",
    "therefore , a large value for the forth order cumulant does not necessarily mean the presence of strong four - particle correlations ( in our illustrative case we have only two - particle correlations ) .",
    "consequently , the fact that star sees a cumulant ratio for protons of @xmath4 at @xmath5 @xcite may well be the result of strong two particle correlations , rather than three and four body correlations , which would be expected close to a critical point @xcite .",
    "therefore , it would be very valuable if the true correlation functions could be extracted from the measured cumulants . in this note",
    "we will discuss how this can be done , at least for the case of one species of particles , such as protons ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "for net - proton cumulants , i.e.  cumulants of the difference distribution of protons and anti - protons , this is unfortunately not the case .",
    "however , at the beam energies where star sees the strongest deviation from poisson behavior , the number of anti - proton to proton ratio is vanishingly small and thus the anti - protons can be ignored .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we demonstrate how the true correlation functions can be related to the cumulants , then we apply these relations to the preliminary star data .",
    "next we discuss the centrality , rapidity , and energy dependence of these correlation functions .",
    "finally we illustrate how just the information about the signs of these correlation functions can be used to exclude certain regions around the critical point .",
    "let us start by introducing the correlation functions , beginning with two particles .",
    "the two particle density for particles with momenta @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , is given by@xmath9where @xmath10 refers to the one particle density , and @xmath11 represents the two - particle correlation function . integrating over the momenta we get @xmath12so that in the absence of correlations , @xmath13 , we obtain @xmath14 . in general the two particle density and correlation function",
    "depend on the momenta of both particles . in the following",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to correlations in rapidity and adopt the following notation @xmath15and similarly for higher order particle densities and correlation functions .",
    "the three particle density depends on the single - particle densities as well as the two and three - particle correlation functions @xmath16and is related to the third order factorial moment @xmath17 via@xmath18where @xmath19 is the integrated genuine three - particle correlation function are often referred to as `` factorial cumulants '' @xcite . ] and",
    "similarly the higher order factorial moments are given by@xmath21    at the same time , the particle number cumulants , @xmath22 , can be expressed in terms of the factorial moments @xcite,@xmath23 and @xmath24where @xmath25 .",
    "formulas for the higher order cumulants can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now we can relate the cumulants in terms of the correlation functions and the mean particle number @xmath26 @xmath27and vice versa @xmath28    before we apply the above equations to extract the correlation strength from the star data , let us make a few more remarks concerning these correlation functions .",
    "it should be clear from - that as we approach the critical point @xmath29 is dominated by @xmath30 which scales with the highest power of the correlation length @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "thus , following @xcite , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 close to the critical point .    frequently in the literature ,",
    "see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , one refers to correlation function where the trivial dependence on the particle density / multiplicity is removed @xmath35which we shall refer to as reduced correlation functions or simply couplings .",
    "for example in terms of the reduced correlation functions the two particle density would be given as @xmath36 .\\]]the reduced correlation functions will prove helpful when studying for instance the centrality dependence of the correlations . integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupling_0 ] ) over rapidity we obtain @xmath37where @xmath38 depends on the rapidity interval @xmath39 and we denote@xmath40    using above definition we can write@xmath41 finally we should point out that direct relation between correlation functions and cumulants can not be established if one considers for example net - proton cumulants . in this case",
    "the additional knowledge of various factorial moments is required .",
    "the relevant formulas are given in the appendix .",
    "before we analyze the existing data several comments are warranted .",
    "* first it would be interesting to see how the correlation functions @xmath42 and couplings @xmath43 scale with multiplicity if the correlations originate from several independent sources of correlations , e.g. , from resonances / clusters or when a+a is a simple superposition of elementary p+p interactions",

    "the final multiplicity distribution is given by @xmath46calculating the factorial moment generating function we obtain@xmath47where @xmath48 is the factorial moment generating function from a single source .",

    "( [ eq : ck - source ] ) . ]",
    "as seen from the above equation @xmath53 scales simply with the number of sources since @xmath51 , being a property of a single independent source , does not depend on @xmath44 . comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq : ck - source ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ eq : cc ] ) we obtain @xmath54 and assuming that the number of produced protons , @xmath55 , is proportional to the number of sources we have for the couplings @xmath56 + this result is rather straightforward . the correlation strength , @xmath57 , for the whole system gets diluted once there are many independent sources of correlations .",
    "suppose we have @xmath44 sources which correlate two particles each .",
    "then we have @xmath58 particles and @xmath59 correlated pairs .",
    "the total number of pairs is @xmath60 and thus the number of correlated over all pairs scales like @xmath61 .",
    "similarly for triplets ( now each source correlates three particles ) one gets @xmath62 correlated out of @xmath63 total triplets , leading to @xmath64 .",
    "the scaling , eq .  , is expected , e.g. , for resonances / clusters of particles or when a+a can be decomposed into elementary p+p collisions .",
    "+ we note that the scaling given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : indep_source ] ) is expected to break down when the sources are not independent .",
    "for example when we have one coherent source of correlations , the number of correlated pairs might be proportional to the total number of pairs and @xmath65 could become constant @xmath66 as a function of @xmath55 .",
    "it would be definitely interesting to observe such transition ( from @xmath67 to const . ) in experimental data . in the next section",
    "we will argue that this is the case for central collisions in the preliminary star data at the lowest energies .",
    "* suppose that indeed @xmath68 are constant or depend only very weakly on the number of produced protons . in this case the correlations , @xmath69 ,",
    "increase with the number of particles .",
    "one scenario would be that the sources of correlation are correlated themselves or that the sources correlate increasing number of particles , e.g. , with increasing @xmath55 clusters get larger ( more particles per cluster ) leading to @xmath51 depending on @xmath55 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : c - ns - n ] ) . given only the integrated reduced correlation function , it is impossible to distinguish between these various scenarios . in any case ,",
    "centrality independence of the couplings , indicate that the increasing number of particles are correlated and , for the lack of a better term , we will refer to this behavior as `` collective '' . in this case",
    "the cumulants , @xmath22 , explicitly depend on @xmath70 , @xmath71 , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : k2-c2]-[eq : k4-c234 ] ) .",
    "consequently the cumulant ratios depend on multiplicity which makes the interpretation of the data rather complicated .",
    "for example by changing centrality or energy we obviously change @xmath72 which may result in nontrivial behavior .",
    "for example if @xmath73 , as in the case of anti - protons at low energy , the cumulants are dominated by the leading term and the cumulant ratios are close to @xmath74 even if couplings carry actually some nontrivial information . + we conclude that the cumulant ratios are rather tricky to interpret if the couplings , @xmath65 , are constant as a function of produced protons .",
    "it seems that studying correlation functions is more appropriate in this case . *",
    "similarly we can make some general observations about the rapidity dependence of cumulants and their ratios . to this end",
    "let us consider two limits and let us assume the rapidity density is constant , @xmath75 in rapidity window of interest : + \\(a ) the correlations are local in rapidity and depend only on the relative distances , @xmath76 .",
    "in this case the couplings or reduced correlation functions , eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupling ] ) , are given by @xmath77 , where @xmath39 is the range in rapidity under consideration .",
    "consequently , the correlation functions @xmath42 and the cumulants scale linearly with @xmath39 @xmath78 + \\(b ) the other extreme are long - range correlations , where the correlation functions are constant over the rapidity region of interest , which is not particularly long - range in rapidity .",
    "thus a constant @xmath79 may not be such a strong requirement . ] . in this case @xmath80 and the correlation functions @xmath42 scale with the n - th power of the rapidity interval @xmath39 @xmath81 the scaling of the cumulants @xmath22 in this case is more subtle since the cumulants depend on correlation functions of various order .",
    "for example the fourth order cumulant @xmath82 depends on the correlation functions @xmath83 to @xmath84 and the dependence of @xmath39 will thus be a polynomial of up to fourth order in @xmath39 .",
    "of course things get more complicated if the rapidity density @xmath85 is not constant and if the correlation length in rapidity is finite but shorter than @xmath39 .",
    "* it is clear that at very low energy the majority of observed protons originate from the incoming nuclei , and are decelerated to mid rapidity . in the simplest model we may assume that protons stop in a given rapidity @xmath39 bin with some probability @xmath86 leading to binomial distribution@xmath87where @xmath88 is the _ total _ number of protons ( that potentially can stop in @xmath39 ) and @xmath89 is the mean number of protons observed in a given acceptance .",

    "for the lowest beam energies , @xmath98 and possibly even for @xmath99 the anti - proton to proton ratio is sufficiently small so that we can ignore the presence of antiprotons without loosing the physics . in this case",

    "note that whereas @xmath164 ( @xmath165 ) is ( anti-)symmetric with respect to @xmath166 , the couplings @xmath29 as a sum of symmetric and antisymmetric terms no longer show this symmetry .",
    "assuming that the analyzed data points are already sufficiently close to the scaling domain of the critical point , we can infer exclusion regions around the critical point from the extracted signs of @xmath158 .",
    "clearly the strongest constraint arises from the fact that in the preliminary star data , @xmath167 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : c2both ] .",
    "however , the two particle correlation is likely also the one which may receive additional contributions from non - critical physics , although resonance decays , the most prevalent two particle correlation , should be a negligible contributions in case of protons . restricting ourselves to the three and four particle correlations , the excluded regions are more limited ,",
    "see figs .",
    "[ fig : c3both ] and [ fig : c4both ] . in this case",
    "the measured three and four particle correlation functions would exclude the region to the left and below the critical point in addition to a region with both higher temperature and chemical potential than that of the critical point .",
    "in this paper we have extracted the two- three- and four - particle proton correlation functions based on preliminary data of the star collaboration .",
    "we have discussed how these correlation functions are expected to scale with centrality and rapidity under various assumptions .",
    "we found that ( a ) at the lowest beam energy of @xmath121 there are significant four particle correlation .",
    "( b ) at @xmath130 the fourth order cumulant is dominated by a negative two - particle correlation .",
    "( c ) for the lowest energies the centrality dependence change from that of an independent source model to a `` collective '' one at @xmath114 . at roughly the same centrality",
    "the three- and four - particle couplings change sign , indicating a change in the underlying dynamics .",
    "( d ) the preliminary data on the rapidity dependence of the cumulant ratio @xmath103 rules out short - range rapidity correlations and is consistent with long - range ( @xmath168 ) correlations . ( e )",
    "we looked at the energy dependence of the relative contributions to the fourth order cumulant , @xmath82 and found that , with an excursion at @xmath127 the scaled correlation are rather constant from @xmath169 down to @xmath96 . at lower energies both",
    "the three and four - particle correlation show a significant energy dependence .",
    "we also found that the two- and three - particle correlations are negative , @xmath170 for the most central bins . at the same time , the four - particle correlation function is positive . applying this observation to an ising model , which is in he same universality class as the qcd critical point",
    ", we were able to exclude various regions in the phase diagram of the ising model . while indicative , this exercise serves more as a demonstration , and it would be interesting to generate similar exclusion plots based on the various models for a qcd phase transition and critical point .    finally , we should stress that the present analysis is based on preliminary data .",
    "furthermore , one should not forget that there are sources of correlations other that critical dynamics .",
    "these need to be removed and understood , and we believe that a study of correlations functions , preferably differential in some of their variable , will be essential to make progress in the search for a qcd critical point .",
