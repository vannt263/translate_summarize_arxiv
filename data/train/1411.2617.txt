    "the birth of higher dimensional knot theory occurred in 1925 , when artin  @xcite introduced the notion of spinning of a classical knot which is a method of making a knotted surface from a given classical knot . in the late 1950s and early 1960s , a number of authors , including haefliger  @xcite , kinoshita  @xcite , levine  @xcite , and gluck  @xcite , looked at the study of higher dimensional knots from the point of view of algebraic topology . in 1961 , fox  @xcite presented a talk at georgia topology conference that evolved into the paper  a quick trip through knot theory . \"",

    "it has been known that links are not determined by their complement . in the case of knotted spheres in @xmath7-space",
    ", gluck  @xcite proved that there are distinct knotted spheres that have homeomorphic complements .    in 1965 , zeeman  @xcite introduced the notion of twist spun knots and showed that @xmath0-twist spun knots are equivalent to trivial @xmath3-knots .",

    "[ main ] there is a nontrivial foam obtained by a @xmath0-twist spinning of a knotted @xmath30-curve .",
    "that is , a @xmath0-twist spun ktg is not always unknotted .",
    "we remind the reader ( chapter 9 @xcite ) that a knotted surface can berepresented in a normal form as a classical knot diagram with rectangular bands that are labeled @xmath51 or @xmath52 ( for up or down ) .",

    ", we can construct the @xmath0-twist spin of @xmath32 , denoted by @xmath53 , from the given classical knot @xmath32 .",
    "since all of knots can be deformed into a trivial knot by performing a finite number of crossing changes , we only need to show that @xmath53 and @xmath54 are ambiently isotopic when @xmath55 is the result of changing a crossing of @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath56 be the crossing at which the crossing change will occur .",

    "the crossing then becomes a minimal point .",

    "then we can consider the closure of @xmath59 as one page in an open book decomposition . since",
    "a knot @xmath32 is an @xmath4-dimensional manifold , the @xmath5-ball on the knot @xmath32 can travel anywhere on the knot @xmath32 . so spinning the classical knot",
    "does not depend on which arc that is split ; see fig .",

    "_        when a ktg is spun or twist spun , it has constituents that are analogous to the constituents of a ktg .",
