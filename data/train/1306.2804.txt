    ". the reported phase shifts amount to about 1@xmath0 using a single neutral atom  @xcite and 3@xmath0 for a single molecule  @xcite .",
    "phase shifts of about 0.3@xmath0 have been achieved recently for a single ion  @xcite . for the sake of simplicity",

    "however , the deduced phase shift per single atom does not exceed the values measured so far in a free - space setup .",
    "the typical phase - shift setup in free space can be simplified to the scheme shown in fig .",

    "the incident electromagnetic field mode is focused onto the atom by a focusing device , e.g. a large numerical aperture lens  @xcite or a parabolic mirror  @xcite .",
    "depending on the electric field strength acting upon the atom , the atom scatters a certain amount of dipole radiation which is phase - shifted with respect to the incident field .",
    "the phase of the scattered field is determined solely by the detuning of the incident light from the atomic resonance .",
    "the scattered radiation as well as the re - diverging incident field are both collected by the same optical element .",
    "this can be a second lens  @xcite or the focusing device itself .",
    "the latter is the case e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a reflective element retro - reflects the incident radiation towards the focusing lens , or when using a deep parabolic mirror as envisaged earlier  @xcite .    after collection ,",
    "scattered and incident radiation are processed in a phase measuring setup .",
    "this may be a mach - zehnder interferometer  @xcite , a heterodyning setup  @xcite or a scheme utilizing polarization degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "as part of the phase measuring setup the scattered and re - collimated incident radiation are focused onto some detector where they interfere . from this it is clear that the overall overlap of the scattered radiation with the incident one plays a decisive role in determining the measurable phase shift , see also ref .",
    "moreover , the amount of coherently scattered light determines the impact of the phase of the scattered light onto the phase of the total field , i.e. the superposition of scattered field and incident field .",

    "@xcite the central parameter governing the phase of the total field is the so called scattering ratio , i.e. the ratio of scattered power to the incident power .",
    "this parameter includes the overlap of the incident field with the dipole field radiated by the atom .",

    "[ kerr ] the inclusion of saturation effects is used to derive a formula for the phase shift that is reminiscent of the kerr effect found in other non - linear optical media .",
    "we consider a two - level atom with upper level @xmath2 and lower level @xmath3 .",
    "it is located at the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "the atom is illuminated by a weak classical field of frequency @xmath4 and amplitude @xmath5 at the place of the atom .",
    "we take @xmath5 to be real .",

    "the expectation value of the lowering operator is given by @xcite @xmath12 with @xmath13 being the density matrix element describing the polarization of the atom .    in the steady state",
    ", we have @xmath14 with the spontaneous emission rate @xmath15 , the rabi frequency @xmath16 , the detuning @xmath17 and the density matrix element @xmath18 gives the probability to find the atom in the upper state .",
    "the steady state solution of the latter is given by @xmath19 which leads to @xmath20 thus , the scattered field amplitude is @xmath21 the phase of the scattered field is hence given by @xmath22    for a wave of power @xmath23 incident onto the atom the field amplitude parallel to the atomic dipole is given by @xcite @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 is the effective solid angle over which the incident field extends calculated weighting by the atomic dipole characteristics .",
    "it has a maximum value of @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is the overlap of the incident field with the field emitted by the atomic dipole , calculated only in the region covered by the incident light .",
    "next , we insert this expression for @xmath5 into the definition of the rabi frequency , approximating @xmath29 . plugging the result into eq .",
    "[ eq : esc ] and integrating over the full solid angle we arrive at the scattered power @xmath30 the last term in the sum of the the denominator is the saturation parameter on resonance @xmath31 .    for the sake of simplicity",

    "this leads to @xmath33    now , we have all ingredients at hand to calculate the phase of the field resulting from the superposition of the incident field and the scattered field .",
    "however , one has to distinguish two scenarios .",
    "the first one is a symmetric setup in the sense that the re - diverging incident field is collected with optics covering the same amount of solid angle as for focusing .",
    "furthermore , the spatial radiation pattern of the incident light after re - collimation is identical to the one before focusing .",
    "this scenario is the one occurring in refs .",
    "@xcite . in an asymmetric setup ,",
    "the optics used for collection / re - collimation may cover a different fraction of the solid angle than the one used for focusing , as also treated e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite for the extinction of a coherent beam .",
    "another example for an asymmetric setup is the usage of different types of optics for focusing and collection , respectively  @xcite .",
    "also every finite size parabolic mirror constitutes an asymmetric setup as outlined in more detail below .",
    "first , we have to account for the fact that only the part of the scattered field emitted into the solid angle cone of the transmitted incident field has to be considered .",
    "the power of this fraction is @xmath34 the amplitude of the corresponding field mode is @xmath35 .",
    "taking the phase of the scattered field into account yields @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , we have @xmath37",
    ". we also have to account for the gouy phase shift of @xmath38 that the transmitted wave experiences while re - diverging from the location of the atom  @xcite .",
    "we do this by @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , only the part of the scattered wave that overlaps with the transmitted incident wave can interfere with it .",
    "moreover , only the coherent part of the scattered light will interfere with the incident light  @xcite .",
    "the coherently scattered power fraction is given by @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "we take this into account by writing @xmath41    the phase of the coherent superposition of incident and scattered field can then be expressed as @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "this leads to @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 we finally arrive at @xmath46 \\ , .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      we now treat the asymmetric case . using optics of different aperture for focusing and re - collimation results in an dipole weighted solid angle covered by the re - collimation optics @xmath47 .",
    "thus eq .",
    "[ eq : pscatom ] changes to @xmath48 and we write @xmath49 with @xmath50 . a further consequence of such a scenario is that the overlap parameter @xmath28 , calculated only for the part of the solid angle used for focusing , may change for the re - collimation optics .",
    "hence , for the part of the scattered light interfering with the incident light we have @xmath51 last but not least the case @xmath52 induces a power loss to the re - collimated incident beam .",
    "we account for this by introducing the parameter @xmath53 with @xmath54 . when calculating the @xmath55-function , we now write @xmath56 .    with these modifications",

    "see text . ]",
    "the results of some example calculations are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : examples ] , starting the discussion with the symmetric case . since the phase shift just changes sign when the detuning does , only values for @xmath68 are plotted .",
    "the solid line depicts the case that results in the maximum possible phase shift at any detuning : focusing from full solid angle with a dipolar radiation pattern and a negligible saturation parameter .",
    "the dashed line depicts the case when focusing from 38% of the solid angle weighted with the radiation pattern of a linear dipole oriented perpendicular to the optical axis .",
    "the solid angle fraction corresponds to the one covered by a microscope objective with a numerical aperture of na=0.95 .",
    "again , we assume perfect mode overlap and negligible saturation .    next , we treat an example for the asymmetric case",
    ". the dotted line corresponds to the experimental setup described in refs .",
    "@xcite and a low but non - negligible saturation parameter .",
    "the setup consists of a parabolic mirror covering almost the entire solid angle , described by a parameter @xmath61 . as incident light field",
    "a radially polarized doughnut mode is considered .",
    "such a mode is expected to couple efficiently to an atom with a linear dipole transition located at the mirror s focus .",
    "a doughnut mode with an overlap parameter of @xmath62 has been achieved recently in experiments  @xcite .",
    "the dash - dotted line shows the phase shift for the same setup and strong saturation of the atom .",
    "however , using a parabolic mirror brings some intricate details that necessitate the use of eq .",
    "[ eq : phiasym ] .",
    "any ray propagating along the optical axis of the parabola which enters the mirror at a distance @xmath69 to the optical axis leaves the mirror at a distance @xmath70 with @xmath71 the focal length of the parabolic mirror  @xcite .",
    "this has the following consequences : for a finite parabolic mirror , the change @xmath72 entails that rays entering the mirror close to the optical axis do not hit the parabolic surface a second time and are not re - collimated .",
    "this results in a smaller effective solid angle for the re - collimated incident light @xmath52 and a re - collimated power - fraction @xmath73 .",
    "furthermore , a parabolic mirror reshapes the radiation pattern of the incident beam . that is , after re - collimation by the parabolic mirror the transmitted incident beam has another overlap @xmath74 with the dipole mode than upon focusing onto the ion .",
    "in the present example , we account for all these effects by setting @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .    performing the calculations for the same setup using eq .",
    "[ eq : phi ] for the symmetric case , i.e. setting @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , leads to larger phase shifts .",
    "but the deviations are so small , on the order of 1.5% , that eq .",
    "[ eq : phi ] will be used in the remainder of this paper for the sake of simplicity .",
    "nevertheless , one can construct realistic examples in which the deviation is more pronounced .    in what follows ,",
    "we examine the phase shift close to resonance in more detail . for arbitrary @xmath28 and @xmath78 the phase shift on resonance",
    "is determined by the sign of the real part of the argument of the @xmath79-function in eq .",
    "[ eq : phi ] : @xmath80 in other words , the solid angle fraction must be larger than @xmath81 for observing a non - zero phase shift on resonance : illumination has to occur from more than half the solid angle ( see also ref .",
    "however , even for @xmath82 a low @xmath28 or a large saturation parameter may result in zero phase shift . figure  [ phase_space ] illustrates this discussion in a phase space picture .",
    "illustration of the phase shift on resonance ( @xmath83 ) in a phase space picture . ]",
    "the change of the phase shift at @xmath83 from @xmath84 to zero occurs in an abrupt manner , i.e. the phase shift depends nonlinearly on the parameter combination @xmath85 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ deltazero ] in more detail for detunings @xmath86 .",
    "the first example ( solid line and dashed line ) with the change of @xmath78 from slightly below to slightly above half solid angle may seem unrealistic . however , this case is realizable by using a parabolic mirror covering almost the entire solid angle and restricting the solid angle cone of the incident light to a fraction of the mirror surface corresponding to the values given above .",

    "we conclude this section noting that it is obvious from eqs .",
    "[ eq : resonance ] and fig .",
    "[ phase_space ] that the overall phase shift is not determined by the atom but rather by the properties of the incident field and the set - up .",
    "no matter how large the coupling efficiency is in dependence of @xmath28 and @xmath78  @xcite , the phase of the light scattered coherently by the atom is fixed for a given detuning .",
    "this phase lag has been examined recently by a background subtraction technique  @xcite in an experimental regime of low coupling efficiency , i.e. exciting the atom from small solid angle .",
    "the better the coupling efficiency and the lower the saturation parameter , the larger is the amount of light scattered coherently into the mode of the incident field .",
    "this amount determines the phase of the superposition of incident and scattered field .",
    "the examples presented in figs .  [ fig : examples ] and  [ deltazero ] already demonstrated that the phase shift induced by a single atom is strongly influenced by the intensity of the light driving the atom . in",
    "what follows , the phase shift derived above is put into a shape reminiscent of the typical formulas used to describe the optical kerr effect .",
    "one way of describing this effect is to write the refractive index as  @xcite @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the weak - field refractive index and @xmath93 describes the change of refractive index due to the intensity @xmath94 of the optical field .",
    "corresponding more detailed expressions can be found for an ensemble of two - level atoms in free space e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite and e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite for an an atomic ensemble in a cavity .",
    "to arrive at a similar expression in the scenario treated here requires several approximations .    in order to have an interaction that is predominantly dispersive , we assume a saturation parameter @xmath95 . in other words ,",
    "the atom is not excited on average and the light is scattered coherently by the atom .",
    "the condition of low saturation is met easiest at large detunings .",
    "therefore , we assume @xmath96 .",
    "this includes the case @xmath97 for which one finds that @xmath98 and hence @xmath99 . in other words ,",
    "we can rewrite eq .",
    "[ eq : phi ] as @xmath100 furthermore , the large detuning approximation allows to replace the @xmath101 function by its argument yielding @xmath102 a taylor expansion of the above equation around @xmath103 finally yields a kerr - type expression reading @xmath104     illustration of the single atom kerr effect for @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath105 ( left ) and @xmath106 ( right ) .",
    "the phase shift is calculated using the full model via eq .",
    "[ eq : phi ] ( solid lines ) and via eq .",
    "[ eq : kerr ] approximating the atom as a pure kerr - type medium ( dashed lines ) . ]",
    "figure  [ kerrfig ] compares the above result to the full model of eq .",
    "[ eq : phi ] . as to be expected , the quality of the approximate expression of eq .",
    "[ eq : kerr ] improves with increasing detuning and decreasing saturation parameters .",
    "as outlined above , the phase shift induced on the exciting field by a single atom in free space is maximized by coupling the incident light to the atom from full solid angle . in this case , the phase shifts observed for large detunings are still of considerable magnitude .",
    "as evident from fig .",
    "[ kerrfig ] , the phase shift observed at 50 linewidths detuning is on the order of the ones reported for low detuning in previous experiments using free space setups .",
    "this suggests that a single atom in free space might be a good candidate for the realization of a quantum repeater scheme based on dispersive light - matter interaction .",
    "such a scheme has been proposed by van loock et al . for cavity",
    "based setups  @xcite . when realizing such a system one has to balance all parameters carefully .",
    "for example , the induced phase shift should exceed the uncertainty of the phase of the incident coherent state , which is given by the inverse of the square root of the state s amplitude if the latter is sufficiently large .",
    "thus , on might be tempted to improve the performance by using coherent states of larger amplitude . but",
    "this in turn results in a larger saturation parameter and a reduction of the imprinted phase shift , unless the temporal width of the incident pulse is increased as well to maintain constant incident power . on the other hand ,",
    "the pulse duration affects the success rate of the repeater scheme .",
    "this brief discussion highlights that a detailed assessment of all parameters using a free - space setup is desirable .",
    "however , this is beyond the scope of the present paper and subject of future work ."
