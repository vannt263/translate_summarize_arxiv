    "x - ray transients ( xrts ) are a class of low - mass x - ray binaries in which long periods of quiescence ( typically decades ) are interrupted by dramatic outbursts , when the x - ray luminosity suddenly increases by up to a factor of 10@xmath13 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "during the outburst , xrts usually reach a state in which the x - ray emission is dominated by thermal emission from the hot inner accretion disk ( i.e. the _ high / soft _  hs  or _ thermal dominated _ state ) .",
    "there are , however , a few of these systems ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) that are instead dominated by a hard non - thermal power - law component likely produced by thermal comptonization of seed photons in the vicinity of the accreting black hole ( i.e. the _ low / hard _  lh  state ) . at even lower accretion rates ,",
    "xrts reach quiescence which may be just an extreme example of the lh state . to explain the lh ( and quiescent ) state a standard disk truncated at some large inner radius",
    "is assumed .",
    "the interior volume is filled with a hot , optically thin , quasi - spherical accretion flow where most of the energy released via viscous dissipation remains in this flow rather than being radiated away ( as in a disk ) to be finally advected by the compact object ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this model , called advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) , is the most widely discussed picture although other alternatives have also been invoked .",
    "for instance , the accretion disk corona model assumes a cool thin disk embedded in a hot corona powered by magnetic flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "also , it has been proposed that emission from jets ( which are believed to be associated with the lh state ) can account for the observed spectra in xrts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "+ the xrt xte j1118 + 480 was discovered by the all sky monitor ( asm ) on board of the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) on 2000 march 29 @xcite as a weak , slowly rising x - ray source .",
    "retrospective analysis of the asm database revealed a previous outburst episode in january 2000 .",
    "the precursor was shorter than the main outburst although both reached similar brightness ( e.g. uemura et al . 2000 ) .",
    "xte j1118 + 480 is one of the few xrts that remained in a lh state throughout the outburst and failed to reach the hs state .",
    "this object is also important for several reasons : it is a secure case of black hole ( @xmath14 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the black hole transient with the shortest orbital period ( @xmath15hr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and also the first black hole binary in the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "additionally , the ratio @xmath16 was extremely low so it has been suggested that xte j1118 + 480 may be an accretion disk corona source seen at high inclination @xcite . however , no eclipse has ever been recorded and consequently , the source should have been intrinsically faint in x - rays @xcite during the outburst .",
    "finally , associated radio emission from this source has been reported @xcite with jet interpretation @xcite . + the low interstellar absorption towards xte j1118 + 480 allowed a detailed multi - wavelength study during the 2000 outburst and quiescence being the only xrt for which extreme ultraviolet observations could be achieved @xcite .",
    "in fact , the best observations of an xrt in the lh state have been made for this system ( together with gx 339 - 4 ) .",
    "these observations have been of great significance in the effort to build a physical model of the accretion flow .",
    "xte j1118 + 480 has been described in terms of an adaf @xcite , an accretion disk corona model @xcite and a jet model @xcite .",
    "+ here we report the follow - up of a new outburst of the halo black hole x - ray transient xte j1118 + 480 ( hereafter j1118 ) and investigate the implications in modeling the structure of accretion flows onto black holes and the mechanisms involved .",

    "we discovered an optical rebrightening of j1118 @xmath205years after its first reported outburst @xcite .",
    "we then embarked on a new campaign of systematic monitoring of the outburst light curve in the optical and infrared bands .",
    "the source reached @xmath21 at the outburst peak , 5.7@xmath60.01 mag above the mean quiescent level . in the infrared we measured total outburst amplitudes of @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 mag in @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "although the optical brightening is similar to that observed during the 2000 outburst , the current event did not power the source above @xmath25 mcrab in x - rays .",
    "similarly , the 2000 outburst , although also faint in x - rays , reached a peak of @xmath26 mcrab @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ outbursta ] we present our overall optical / infrared light curve of the 2005 outburst .",

    "the precursor x - ray light curve for the 2000 outburst shows a fred and the march outburst ( x - ray and optical ) showed a plateau morphology ( see the 2000 outburst light curves in e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we note , however , that neither the sources that remained in a lh state , nor a large number of those which reach the hs state are fred - shaped .",
    "we calculated the hardness ratio hr2 ( 5 - 12kev/3 - 5 kev ) from the rxte / asm data .",
    "although only a few measurements were possible due to statistical limitations ( see fig .  [ outbursta ] ) , we found hr2=1.53@xmath60.02 at the peak of the outburst ( from hjd-2453300= 83 to 86 ) .",

    "+ the shape of the 2005 outburst light curve is remarkably similar to that of the _ mini - outbursts _ observed in gro j0422 + 32 @xcite and xte j1859 + 226 @xcite .",
    "about 30 days after the 2005 outburst peak , there is evidence for a short - lived re - flare with amplitude of about 1mag above the pre - event level and lasting for about 10 days ( * ? ? ?",

    "[ outbursta ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the light curve displays a small bump just before the system definitely settled down into quiescence .",
    "this type of behavior was also found during the _ mini - outbursts _ of both gro j0422 + 32 and xte j1859 + 226 ( see fig .  [ outburstb ] ) .",
    "these light curves have comparable length and brightness and also the x - ray to optical ratio measured in j1118 is similar to what has been seen in _ mini - outbursts _ , i.e. it is much lower than in normal outbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these facts support the suggestion of @xcite that the outbursts in j1118 are indeed _ mini - outbursts _ rather than full xrt events .",

    "the data have been phase folded on the orbital ephemeris of @xcite .",
    "note the apparent changes in amplitude and morphology of the light curves as the outburst decays .",
    "we divide the light curve in 6 different stages ( see also fig .",
    "[ outbursta ] ) : pre - outburst quiescence ( i ) , rise ( ii ) , peak ( iii ) , decay ( iv ) , near - quiescence ( v ) and post - outburst quiescence ( vi ) .",
    "+ ( i ) on 2004 december 19 ( ut ) j1118 was still in quiescence and displayed the characteristic double - humped ellipsoidal modulation , with @xmath200.16mag semi - amplitude , driven by the tidally distorted secondary star .",
    "+ ( ii ) on 2005 january 4 , the outburst had already started and the @xmath1band light curve shows the combination of the ellipsoidal modulation and a linear rise of @xmath27mag / d .",
    "+ ( iii ) the outburst peaks on january 14 and then the brightness in all bands started to decay at a moderately slow rate of @xmath28mag / d .",
    "near the outburst peak , on january 20 and 22 , the @xmath1 band light curve shows a low - amplitude modulation superimposed on short time scale ( @xmath29s ) variability likely due to flickering .",
    "this modulation was not observed after january 23 ( alas , the @xmath1 band data obtained in january 21 was badly affected by weather conditions ) . the same modulation was also reported by @xcite in their @xmath30 band light curves obtained during january 1820 .",
    "this indicates that either the low - amplitude modulation was short - lived and/or its amplitude is diluted by the flickering or undetected due to the photometric accuracy .",
    "we searched for periodicities in the detrended light curves of january 20 and 22 by computing a scargle periodogram . the result is shown in fig .  [ fig_optmodul ] .",
    "the observing window produces an alias pattern at @xmath31 cycle / day with the strongest peak at @xmath32 day .",
    "the 1-day alias centered at @xmath33 day lies close to both the orbital and superhump periods ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the observed modulation is probably related to the orbital motion , the poor data sampling impedes an accurate period determination . in fig .",
    "[ evolucion_curva ] we show the light curve of january 20 light curve folded on the orbital period and averaged into 50 phase bins , although the cleanest modulation is seen when folding the data on @xmath34 day ( see left top panel of fig .  [ fig_optmodul ] ) .",
    "+ ( iv ) from the beginning of february the light curve began a moderately abrupt fall .",
    "we estimated a rate of @xmath35mag / d in the @xmath1 band and a smoother slope of @xmath36mag / d in the infrared bands . on february 2 , no modulation is detected but only considerable flickering ( @xmath370.02mag ) , higher than found at the peak of the outburst .",
    "+ ( v ) at the end of february , about 60 days after the outburst onset , j1118 settled into a near - quiescence level at @xmath1=18.35@xmath60.02 ( fig .",
    "[ evolucion_curva ] ) . on february 25",
    "the light curve is consistent with a ( distorted ) double - humped ellipsoidal modulation with a semi - amplitude of @xmath200.10 mag .",
    "we also note that the amplitude of the ellipsoidal modulation is lower at near - quiescence than at true quiescence before and after outburst .",
    "this is what we would expect if the contribution of the accretion disk to the total light is higher in february 25 ( v ) than in december 19 ( i ) and april 26 ( vi ) .",
    "assuming that the decrease in flux is solely due to the accretion disk light fading and that the disk contributed @xmath2055% to the total quiescent @xmath1band light @xcite , we estimate a relative contribution of the accretion disk of @xmath2077% during epoch v. + ( vi ) two months later , j1118 faded another 0.6mag and reached @xmath3819 on march 17 .",
    "the system remained at this level from there on , suggesting it reached true quiescence . at the same epoch we measured the following colors in the infrared : @xmath5=16.66@xmath60.07 , @xmath39= 0.8@xmath60.2 and @xmath40=1.1@xmath60.1 .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath5 magnitudes are consistent with those observed by @xcite during the pre - outburst quiescence ( our epoch i ) .",
    "the colours @xmath39 and @xmath40 are much redder than expected for a later k or early mv secondary star suggesting an additional contribution .",
    "+ the scargle periodogram of the epoch vi @xmath1band lightcurves ( march 17 , 19 , 20 , 23 and april 22 , 26 ) shows a strong peak centered on @xmath41 day ( see left bottom panel of fig .  [ fig_optmodul ] ) , consistent with half the orbital period @xmath42 day .",
    "also , these light curves are distorted likely due to the presence of a superhump wave , as already noticed in the near - quiescence state at the end of the 2000 outburst @xcite .",
    "in contrast , on december 19 and january 4 ( epochs i and ii ) , there is no evidence of superhumps .",
    "this suggests that , during outburst , the disk expands to the 3:1 ( or 2:1 ) resonance radius and is then forced to precess by tidal perturbations caused by the secondary star .",
    "afterwards , it starts to shrink although at early quiescence it is still large enough to produce superhump waves .",
    "finally , some time later , the disk radius becomes shorter than the resonance radius and superhumps disappear .",
    "there has been some evidence of optical / infrared outbursts starting before the x - ray outbursts in some xrts : gs 1124 - 684 @xcite , gro j165540 @xcite , gro j0422 + 32 @xcite , v404 cyg ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , aql x-1 @xcite , j1118 during the main 2000 ( march ) outburst @xcite and 4u1543 - 47 @xcite .",
    "also , in dwarf novae the uv rise has been observed to start several hours after the optical outburst ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in the framework of the _ disk instability model _ ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the x - ray ( or uv ) delay suggests an ` outside - in ' disturbance of the accretion disk .",
    "once the instability is triggered in the outer regions , a heating front propagates inwards turning the disk from the cold ( quiescent ) state to a hot state .",
    "hence the outburst is first noticed in the optical and then in x - rays ( or uv ) .",
    "the time scale of the lags can be explained assuming the accretion disk is truncated at some inner radius .",
    "the heating front stops when it arrives at the truncation radius , but the inner edge of the disk moves towards the compact object on the viscous time scale , longer than the front propagation time .",
    "the adaf model can offer a natural explanation for the disk truncation in xrts .",
    "hence , it has been proposed that the disk inner truncation radius can be estimated by measuring the x - ray to optical delay @xcite .",
    "+ to take advantage of the fact that our optical observations covered part of the rise phase ( see fig .  [ outbursta ] ) , we inspected whether the optical and x - ray outbursts were simultaneous or if one lags the other . the time - resolved optical light curve taken on 2005 january 4",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ evolucion_curva ] ) shows a linear rise .",
    "we therefore estimate the starting time for the optical rise to be @xmath43 ( hjd ) from a linear fit to this curve .",
    "a more problematic issue is to determine the starting time of the x - ray outburst .",
    "the x - ray light curve from asm does not provide any useful information below the 10 mcrab sensitivity level and hence extrapolation is required .",
    "we estimate that the x - ray outburst starting time is consistent with @xmath44 ( hjd ) , where the associated uncertainty quotes the differences between the several extrapolations we performed .",
    "this implies a @xmath45-day lag between the onset of the x - ray and optical outbursts .",
    "unfortunately , the asm sensitivity level is well above the quiescent flux level making it very likely that any extrapolation overestimates the delay . besides , most of the sources detected by the asm need to brighten significantly above quiescence to be detected ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for more details on this concern ) .",
    "therefore the true start of the x - ray outburst could be earlier than @xmath46 .",
    "this fact forces us to conclude that the 4-day lag is just an upper limit as it is the 10-day lag estimated by @xcite . in short , although we can draw a qualitative picture of the evolution of the accretion disk in j1118 after the outburst , it is not possible to estimate a reliable pre - outburst truncation radius from the x - ray delay using asm data alone .",
    "we constructed the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for different outburst epochs through the outburst .",
    "the magnitudes were first corrected for interstellar extinction using @xmath47=0.013 @xcite and the reddenings tabled in @xcite , although this makes only a small difference in the dereddened magnitudes because the extinction is so low .",
    "our outburst seds are shown in fig .",
    "[ seds ] . here",
    "we have excluded some nights for clarity to avoid duplication .",
    "all seds are quasi - power - laws with @xmath48 increasing toward the blue .",
    "we have performed power - law fits to the optical seds only ( from log@xmath49=14.54 to 14.83 ) , to the infrared magnitudes alone ( from log@xmath49=14.13 to 14.38 ) and then to the whole wavelength range ( from log@xmath49=14.13 to 14.83 ) .",
    "the spectral indices we found have been plotted as a function of time and are shown in fig .",
    "[ seds ] ( bottom panel ) , where @xmath10 .",
    "+ when considering the optical data alone ( open squares in fig .",
    "[ seds ] ) the source appears steeper ( bluer ) than the canonical @xmath50 of a steady state viscously heated disk , being @xmath11 at the peak of the outburst ( from hjd@xmath512453300=85 to 90 ) . during the decay phase ( iv ) , it becomes optically softer with @xmath52 .",
    "this trend is consistent with the cooling of the optically bright regions .",
    "however , when fitting the infrared alone the trend is reversed showing that the infrared evolves very differently ( open triangles ) than the optical . the joint fit ( filled circles ) is the interplay between these components and shows an exponential trend becoming bluer throughout the outburst . at the decay phase the index is consistent with @xmath50 .",
    "we will discuss the implications of the different seds in the next section .",
    "we present the follow - up of the new outburst of the halo black hole x - ray transient xte j1118 + 480 .",

    "the shape of the light curve is remarkably similar to the mini - outbursts observed in gro j0422 + 32 and xte j1859 + 226 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath7(1 - 10 kev)@xmath545 similar to mini - outburst episodes , whereas typically this ratio is @xmath20500 in normal x - ray transient outbursts . + quiescent xrts are often explained by assuming an accretion disk extending down to a certain transition radius while the inner volume is filled with a hot adaf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this model predicts that , after outburst , the inner disk edge will move farther inward . because the efficiency of energy release in the adaf region is very low ,",
    "the x - ray outburst starts when the densest parts of the disk can penetrate far enough in to allow an efficient transformation of gravitational energy into radiation .",
    "the outer disk is also expected to change . in the course of the outburst ,",
    "matter diffuses inwards closing the disk while angular momentum transferred to the outer parts forces the outer radius to increase .",
    "if it reaches the 3:1 resonance radius , the disk will precess by tidal interaction with the secondary star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a superhump modulation will be presumably visible .",
    "this was the case in march 2000 when the change in the outer disk radius could be measured from the change in the superhump period at different stages of the outburst @xcite .",
    "equally , in 2005 we found a 0.02-mag amplitude variation during the early decline and also a distorted double - humped ellipsoidal modulation during the near - quiescence level and true quiescence .",
    "this suggests that the disk expanded after outburst to the 3:1 resonance disk radius where it remained during the early phases of quiescence .",

    "this difference between the optical and the infrared seds , more important at the outburst peak , suggests that the infrared is dominated by a different component ( a jet ? ) whereas in the optical we are presumably seeing the disk evolution .",

    "<S> we present optical and infrared monitoring of the 2005 outburst of the halo black hole x - ray transient xte j1118 + 480 . </S>",
    "<S> we measured a total outburst amplitude of @xmath0mag in the @xmath1 band and @xmath2mag in the infrared @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands . </S>",
    "<S> the hardness ratio hr2 ( 5 - 12kev/3 - 5 kev ) from the rxte / asm data is 1.53@xmath60.02 at the peak of the outburst indicating a hard spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> both the shape of the light curve and the ratio @xmath7(1 - 10kev)@xmath8 resemble the mini - outbursts observed in gro j0422 + 32 and xte j1859 + 226 . during early decline </S>",
    "<S> , we find a 0.02-mag amplitude variation consistent with a superhump modulation , like the one observed during the 2000 outburst . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , xte j1118 + 480 displayed a double - humped ellipsoidal modulation distorted by a superhump wave when settled into a near - quiescence level , suggesting that the disk expanded to the 3:1 resonance radius after outburst where it remained until early quiescence . </S>",
    "<S> the system reached quiescence at @xmath9 about three months after the onset of the outburst . </S>",
    "<S> the optical rise preceded the x - ray rise by at most 4 days . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) at the different epochs during outburst are all quasi - power laws with @xmath10 increasing toward the blue . at the peak of the outburst we derived @xmath11 for the optical data alone and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 when fitting solely the infrared . </S>",
    "<S> this difference between the optical and the infrared seds suggests that the infrared is dominated by a different component ( a jet ? ) whereas the optical is presumably showing the disk evolution . </S>"
