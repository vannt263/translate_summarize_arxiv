    "however , since the _ bepposax _ s first discovery on 1997 february 28 ( costa et al . 1997 ) it is known that gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) also produce x - ray afterglows , which can be detected with modern x - ray observatories for several hours and sometimes several days after the burst .",

    "no significant flux variability was detected , but the spectrum is very typical for x - ray afterglows of grb , supporting the identification of this source with grb  001025 .",
    "it is interesting to consider an alternative identification of the x - ray source with a background quasar .",
    "an x - ray bright quasar 3c273 has a r magnitude of @xmath1512.5 ( odell et al .",
    "1978 ) and the 0.5 - 10  kev x - ray flux of 23@xmath2210@xmath34 erg/@xmath24/s ( reeves & turner 2000 ) . neglecting the k - correction and simply scaling the r magnitude to the x - ray flux",
    "we find that if a 3c273-like quasar is a source of the detected x - ray flux of @xmath154.7@xmath2210@xmath33 erg/@xmath24/s ( 0.5 - 10  kev ) then its optical counterpart would have a r magnitude of @xmath1521.7 .",
    "as in fact an optical counterpart for grb  001025 had not been found down to r=24.5 ( fynbo et al . 2000 ) we consider unlikely that the x - ray source is an agn .",
    "we have detected power - law spectra with index @xmath152 from two grb afterglows . in case of grb  011211 an identification of the x - ray source with the grb",
    "is supported by the observation of optical transient and also by the decline of x - ray flux during the _ xmm - newton _ observation . for grb  001025",
    "we do not have such supporting evidence , but the spectral shape itself together with the position of x - ray source inside ipn / rxte error box allows us to suggest that the source is indeed an afterglow of grb  001025 .",
    "power - law fit with slope @xmath152 is very typical for detected x - ray afterglows of grbs ( see e.g. harrison et al . 2001 ,",
    "int zand et al .",
    "2001 , antonelli et al .",
    "we did not detect any significant changes in the x - ray spectrum during the long observation of grb  011211 .",
    "afterglow of grb  001025 was observed significantly later after the burst , and measured x - ray flux was much lower , but the spectrum was almost identical to grb  011211 . conspicuously the x - ray spectra in all or most of the observed afterglows are generated by common physical process and do not depend much on the differences in the burst environments .",
    "overall spectral shape can be fit to popular model of synchrotron emission with possible inclusion of inverse compton scattering ( piran 1999 ; granot & sari 2002 ; sari & esin 2001 ) .",
    "no significant absorption above the galactic values has been detected in the x - ray spectra .",
    "high absorption would be naturally expected if the burst occurs in a high - density star - forming region .",
    "ramirez - ruiz , trentham & blain ( 2002 ) suggested that high absorption in nearby ( relative to the burst birthplace ) interstellar media may be the reason for a lack of optical detections in a significant fraction of grb .",
    "the absorption should be detectable in soft x - rays ( 0.5 - 2  kev ) .",
    "contrary to such expectations , we did not detect any significant absorption above the galactic value in both a grb with optical afterglow ( grb  011211 ) and without it ( grb  001025 ) .",
    "the lack of x - ray absorption in grb  011211 is consistent with the lack of detected reddenning in the spectrum of optical afterglow ( simon et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "reeves et al .",
    "( 2002a , hereafter rwo ) reported on the discovery of a blue - shifted line complex in the spectrum of grb  011211 .",
    "the lines have been detected only with pn detector and only during first 5  ks of the observation , with the source located close to the ccd chip boundary ( fig .",
    "we have extracted source and background spectra from the same regions as rwo ( reeves et al .",
    ". the spectrum can be satisfactory fit to power - law with @xmath5=2.4 and n@xmath31 = 8 @xmath22 10@xmath32 @xmath2 ( @xmath35=1.03 for 44 d.o.f .",
    "joint fit of pn , mos1 and mos2 data gives @xmath35=0.92 ( 72 d.o.f . ) for @xmath5=2.15@xmath60.06 and an absorption fixed at the galactic value .",
    "hence we are able to get the perfect fit using a simple power - law model we do not see much value in adding extra lines to the model .",
    "addition of 5 lines at the energies specified by rwo gives @xmath35=0.93 ( 62 d.o.f . ) for joint fit of the pn and mos data .",
    "the analysis of pn data alone allowed us to reproduce line fluxes reported by rwo with somewhat lower significance ( fig .",
    "4c and table 2 ) .",
    "we note that the pn data should be treated with special caution for the first 5  ks of the observation because of the unfortunate position of the source on the ccd . in their analysis rwo",
    "collected source data from two different pn chips and from the areas near the interchip boundary , which are the least suitable for fine spectroscopy .",
    "our extensive analysis showed that any alternative choice of extraction regions for the source and background leads to further reduction in the lines significance .",
    "we also found that background spectrum collected over the interchip edge is dominated by a strong feature at 0.7 kev , exactly at the energy of the most significant `` line '' reported by rwo ( see fig.4f ) .",
    "though the bulk of the events forming this line are eliminated by the event filtering we are still concerned that some of these bad events may be present in the spectrum of grb  011211 .",
    "our concern is amplified by the lack of any of the rwo `` lines '' in the pn spectrum after the reorientation ( fig.4d ) .",
    "spectral evolution of the source in sync with satellite revolutions looks quite suspicious unless one suggests that presense of the `` lines '' depends on the position of the source on the chip .",
    "such alternative hypothesis is further confirmed by a lack of `` lines '' in the mos data ( fig .",
    "it may therefore be concluded that there is no definitive evidence for the presence of the line complex at a redshift of 1.88 in the x - ray spectrum of grb  011211 .",
    "the existence of such complex is a possibility , but its statistical significance is greatly overestimated by rwo .",
    "our analysis suggests that the spectrum of grb  011211 is featureless and does not contain any significant line emission .",
    "we have used publicly available data obtained with _ xmm - newton _ satellite .",
    "we are grateful to the personnel of the _ xmm - newton _ science operations centre at vilspa , spain for satellite operations and expedited preparation of data products for scientific analysis .",
    "we are thankful to w.priedhorsky and l.titarchuk for encouraging advices , and to anonymous referee for her / his helpful comments .",
