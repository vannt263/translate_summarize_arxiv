    "fluids of platelike colloidal particles , e.g. , clay suspensions , are of enormous fundamental and technological relevance because of their abundance and their distinct properties due to the orientational degrees of freedom of the constituting particles .",

    "quite some progress has been made in both the synthesis @xcite and the theoretical description of the equilibrium structure of suspensions of platelike colloidal particles .",
    "however , understanding the _ non - equilibrium _ properties of these systems is still a big challenge .",
    "systems out of equilibrium are commonly analyzed either by investigating the _ relaxation _ of the system into equilibrium after an instant change of the conditions , e.g. , due to switching an external field , or by studying the system in a ( non - equilibrium ) stationary state .",

    "moreover , dft is reproduced as the stationary limit of ddft .",
    "the motivation of the ddft equation within this work follows the traditional reasoning known from treatments of time - dependent landau - ginzburg and cahn - hillard models in studies of critical dynamics , spinodal decomposition , and crystal growth @xcite : the larger the thermodynamic distance from equilibrium , the faster the change of the state of the system . in the present case",
    "the state can change due to translation as well as due to rotation of the platelike colloidal particles .",

    "relaxation dynamics is investigated by considering a two - step switching process : first an initially homogeneous stable or metastable isotropic state is brought out of equilibrium by switching _ on _ a two - dimensional array of gaussian laser beams .",
    "the laser potential acts as an external potential which tends to form an inhomogeneous equilibrium state . in sec .",
    "[ sec : relaxationinexternalfield ] the relaxation towards this inhomogeneous equilibrium state is traced by integrating the ddft equation for the presence of the laser potential .",
    "after equilibrating the system in the presence of a laser potential , the laser beams are switched _ off _ and the dynamics is described by the ddft equation for vanishing external field .",

    "in particular , a transient cubic symmetric total density profile changes into an only rectangular symmetric total density profile . for a model of continuous orientations",
    "it can be expected to find an axial symmetry instead of the cubic symmetry .",
    "however , the spontaneous symmetry breaking into a rectangular symmetric equilibrium state is expected to be found for continuous orientational degrees of freedom , too .    for an infinite system initially prepared within the isotropic - nematic two - phase coexistence region and one single laser beam of sufficient strength , instead of an array of laser beams",
    ", one would expect an equilibrium structure composed of three regions : a narrow high - density core at the position of the laser beam is surrounded by an annulus of nematic structure of total density @xmath168 ( see sec .  [",
    "subsec : choiceofparameters ] ) which is surrounded by an annulus of isotropic structure of total density @xmath169 ( see sec .  [",
    "subsec : choiceofparameters ] ) ; the sizes of the isotropic and nematic annuli are related to the initial state by means of the  lever rule  . in order to form this structure the system has to be large enough such that the amount of fluid within the high - density core and the isotropic - nematic interface is negligible as compared to the total amount of fluid .",
    "however , the two - dimensional grid applied within this work does not allow for sufficiently large single beam systems .",
    "in contrast , the smallness of the periodicity of the system considered in this work leads to a rather strong dilution of the fluid in the space between the laser beams .    in classical nucleation theory",
    "one considers the temporal evolution of fluctuation induced  droplets  of the stable ( nematic ) phase surrounded by the metastable ( isotropic ) phase , where the densities are chosen as the two - phase coexistence values .",
    "the smallness of the periodicity of the current system , however , leads to a high - density core whose size equals the size of the laser beam and whose density is determined by the strength of the external potential .",
    "therefore the high - density cores in this work are very different from the  droplets  considered in classical nucleation theory .",
    "moreover , the relaxation paths here do _ not _ cross the ",
    "critical nucleus  , which corresponds to the minimal perturbation that lead to the equilibrium state and which is located at a saddle point of the free energy @xcite .",
    "thus the current results can be partly looked at in terms of the terminology of classical nucleation theory , because both are based on a free energy function(al ) , however , the setup considered here is different from that of classical nucleation theory .    after attaining a state close to the equilibrium state in the presence of the laser potential the laser beams",
    "are switched off and the relaxation of the ( now ) free fluid to equilibrium is traced . for sufficiently large initial supersaturation of the initial state ,",
    "one finds the central region of increased particle density stretching ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the shape of these cores resemble tactoids which have been found in dispersions of rodlike colloidal particles @xcite . if the moving density fronts hit the periodic boundaries of the modeled part of the system they merge with their  images  into a superstructure ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) . as the nematic directors within the high - density cores of the individual laser beams may point into different directions the merging of two neighboring cores",
    "is expected to give rise to one more relaxation process in which the merging cores reorient their colloidal particles along a common nematic director .",
    "this effect , however , is beyond the present study .    in summary ,",
    "a novel dynamic density functional theory for a model of fluids of platelike colloidal particles has been proposed and applied to the relaxation dynamics of the fluid under the influence of the potential of a two - dimensional array of laser beams .",
    "a rich phenomenology including the occurrence of individual approximately elliptical high - density cores and the possible formation of complex superstructures has been found .",
