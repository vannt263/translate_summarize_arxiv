    "it is of great scientific importance to study the dissociation of diatomic molecules on metal surfaces ( dissociative sticking ) , to meet some intrinsic interests on mechanisms for bond breaking and bond formation and origins of activation energy barriers @xcite .",
    "the dissociation of the hydrogen molecule ( h@xmath0 ) on metal surfaces are furthermore key events for lots of technological applications such as hydrogen storage for fuels @xcite , hydrogen caused embrittlement @xcite , and heterogeneous catalysis @xcite . among all the metals ,",
    "the mg(0001 ) surface is one of the most studied prototypes , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "however , some basic problems concerning the dissociation process and energy barrier still have discrepancies yet . as early as 1981 , nrskov _ et al . _ for the first time studied the dissociation of h@xmath0 on the mg(0001 ) surface , observing a molecularly adsorbed precursor state and an energy barrier of 0.5 ev for dissociation @xcite . later , by using the more precise first - principles methods , bird _ et al . _ discovered that although the most energetically favorable site for dissociation is the bridge site as reported in nrskov s paper , the dissociation energy barrier is 0.37 ev , rather than the reported 0.5 ev , and there is no precursor state @xcite .",
    "however , the discrepancy on the dissociation energy barrier remains ever since then .",
    "et al . _ reported a value of 1.15 ev for the dissociation , after systematically considered the zero point energy of h@xmath0 within their first - principles calculations @xcite .",
    "et al . _ reported a value of 1.05 ev by employing first - principles calculations and transition state theory @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , johansson _",
    "recently organized an experiment to study the dissociation energy barrier for h@xmath1 at mg(0001 ) , and the obtained barrier is 0.6 @xmath2 0.9 ev @xcite , which disagrees with all the reported theoretical values .",
    "so it is still an open question as to the correct dissociation energy barrier for h@xmath0 at mg(0001 ) .    on the other hand",
    ", it has been recently suggested that steric effects might be important during the adsorption and dissociation of diatomic molecules on metal surfaces @xcite . for the adsorption of d@xmath0 on cu(111 ) , both experimental and theoretical investigations found that dissociation of d@xmath0 occurs preferentially when the molecule approaches with its bond parallel to the surface @xcite .",
    "similar dependence on polar angle has also been theoretically predicted for the dissociative sticking of o@xmath0 on the al(111 ) surface @xcite . when considering the dissociative adsorption of h@xmath0 on metal surfaces",
    ", steric effects might be more important because of the low inertia moment of h@xmath0 and correspondingly high possibility to rotate .",
    "in fact , it has already been pointed out that during the dissociative adsorption of h@xmath0 on the pd(111 ) surface , the molecular axis orientation has a drastic effect and low activation barriers are only met over a small range of @xmath3 values from parallel the surface @xcite . and for the adsorption on the nial(110 ) surface , h@xmath0 molecules rotate abruptly when they are close to the surface , which allows them to adopt the orientation that is more convenient for dissociation ( i.e. , nearly parallel to the surface ) @xcite . for the adsorption of h@xmath0 on the mg(0001 ) surface ,",
    "however , this important issue of steric effects has not been considered yet .",
    "motivated by this observation , here by using the first - principles calculations , we study the rotation of h@xmath0 during the dissociative adsorption on the mg(0001 ) surface and its corresponding influences on the dissociation energy barrier .",
    "we show that the most energetically favorable path for h@xmath0 dissociation at mg(0001 ) is fundamentally determined by the steric effect .",
    "our calculations were performed within dft using the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package @xcite .",
    "the pw91 @xcite generalized gradient approximation and the projector - augmented wave potential @xcite were employed to describe the exchange - correlation energy and the electron - ion interaction , respectively .",
    "the cutoff energy for the plane wave expansion was set to 250 ev .",
    "the mg(0001 ) surface was modeled by a five - atomic - layer slab plus a vacuum region of 20  .",
    "a @xmath4 supercell was adopted in the study of the h@xmath0 adsorption since our test calculations have showed that it is large enough to avoid the interaction between adjacent hydrogen molecules .",
    "integration over the brillouin zone was done using the monkhorst - pack scheme @xcite with @xmath5 grid points .",
    "the calculated lattice constants of bulk mg ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) and the bond length of isolated h@xmath0 are 3.207  , 5.145    and 0.748  , respectively , in good agreement with the experimental values of 3.21  , 1.62    @xcite and 0.74    @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the potential energy surface was interpolated to 209 points with different bond length ( @xmath8 ) and height ( @xmath9 ) of h@xmath0 at each surface site .",
    "after geometry optimization for the mg(0001 ) surface , we build our model to study the potential energy surface ( pes ) of h@xmath0 on the relaxed mg surface . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , there are four different high - symmetry sites on the mg(0001 ) surface , respectively the top , bridge ( bri ) , hcp and fcc hollow sites .",
    "after pes calculations , we find that the dissociation barrier of h@xmath0 at low - symmetry sites is always larger than at high - symmetry sites , proving that high - symmetry sites play crucial roles in the adsorption of diatomic molecules , similar to that has been observed on the adsorption of oxygen molecules on the pb(111 ) surface @xcite . and",
    "in the following , we will only give the results at the four high - symmetry sites .",
    "at each surface site , an adsorbed h@xmath0 has three different principle orientations , respectively along the @xmath10 ( i.e. , [ @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 ( i.e. , [ @xmath13 ) , and @xmath14 ( i.e. , [ @xmath15 ) directions .",
    "herein , we use top-@xmath16 , bri-@xmath16 , hcp-@xmath16 and fcc-@xmath16 respectively to represent the total twelve high - symmetry channels for the adsorption of h@xmath0 on the mg surface .    throughout our pes calculations , we find no molecular adsorption precursor states for h@xmath0 at mg(0001 ) , according well with all previous reports , except for the one by nrskov _",
    "_ using jellium model @xcite . our calculated result for the lowest dissociation energy barrier , as well as that in other theoretical and experimental reports , is given in table .",
    "i. the minimum energy path ( mep ) for the dissociation of h@xmath0 on the mg(0001 ) surface is found to be along the bri-@xmath12 channel , which is consistent with all previous first - principles studies .",
    "the transition state obtained from our pes calculations along the bri-@xmath12 channel is at the point where @xmath8=1.12    and @xmath9=1.16  , which accords with previous results @xcite .",
    "however , as we will see later , this transition state needs to be modified after considering the rotational degree of freedom of h@xmath0 .    at the bridge site , however , we find that the total energy of the h@xmath0/mg system is not always smaller along the bri-@xmath12 channel than along other channels .",
    "this is a key point in this paper .",
    "in fact , at large values of h@xmath0 height from mg(0001 ) surface , we find that the total energy is smaller along the bri-@xmath14 channel than along the bri-@xmath12 channel . to show this , we plot in figs .",
    "2(a)-(c ) the two - dimensional cuts of the pes along the bri-@xmath16 channels . correspondingly , the minimum energy paths in figs .",
    "2(a)-(c ) are collected and plotted in fig .",
    "it can be clearly seen that there is a prominent crossing point in the minimum energy paths along bri-@xmath12 and bri-@xmath14 channels , at which the distance of the h@xmath0 molecule from the surface takes a value of @xmath17=1.26  . before this crossing ,",
    "the total energy of the adsorption system along the bri-@xmath14 channel is always lower than along the bri-@xmath12 channel .",
    "this finding indicates that h@xmath0 prefers to orient perpendicular to the mg(0001 ) surface until it reaches the height lower than 1.26  . after the crossing point , whereas , the system along the bri-@xmath12 channel has a smaller total energy than along the bri-@xmath14 channel , and h@xmath0 tends to rotate from the bri-@xmath14 channel to the bri-@xmath12 channel .",
    "we then further study the influence of the molecular rotation on the dissociation energy barrier of h@xmath0 .",
    "for this we have calculated the total energy by fixing the mass center of h@xmath0 at the bridge site with the height of 1.16    and the molecular bond length of 1.12  , while allowing h@xmath0 to rotate around its mass center in the @xmath12-@xmath14 plane ( see the inset in fig .",
    "the calculated angle dependence of the total energy is shown in fig .",
    "clearly , it can be seen that the transition state ( namely , the saddle point in the pes for h@xmath0 dissociation ) should be the structure where the orientation of h@xmath0 is 21@xmath18 from the @xmath10-@xmath14 plane .",
    "this rotation of h@xmath0 results in a 86 mev modification on the dissociation energy barrier .",
    "this finding suggests that steric factors that has not been considered in previous theoretical calculations might be ( at least partially ) responsible for their discrepancies with experimental measurement .",
    "although it has long been explored for steric effects on the dissociative adsorption of diatomic molecules on metal surfaces , the specific reasoning has seldom been discussed yet .",
    "herein we will try to find the underlying mechanisms on the rotation of h@xmath0 during the dissociative adsorption on the mg(0001 ) surface , by analyzing carefully the charge distributions and electronic interactions along the adsorption process of h@xmath1 .",
    "figures 4(a ) and ( b ) show the difference electron density for the adsorption system with @xmath19 to be 2.00 and 1.16    along the bri-@xmath12 channel , namely , @xmath20,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are respectively the electron density of the adsorption system , the h@xmath1 molecule and the clean mg(0001 ) surface . to calculate @xmath24 , the atomic positions in the last two terms in eq .",
    "1 have been kept at those of the first term . through careful wavefunction analysis",
    ", we find that at the beginning of the adsorption process , the molecular orbitals of h@xmath1 orthogonalize with electronic states of mg and thus are broadened . as shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) , the surface electrons of mg are repelled from the region occupied by the h@xmath1 bonding electrons due to these orthogonalizations .",
    "this interaction has also been observed during the interacations of h@xmath1 with other metals such as the al(111 ) @xcite and transition metal surfaces @xcite .",
    "when the h@xmath1 molecule is close enough to the mg(0001 ) surface and come to the transition state for its dissociation , electrons transfer from electronic states of mg to the antibonding orbital of h@xmath1 , which can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "we can also see from fig .",
    "4(b ) that the orthogonalizations between electronic states of mg and the bonding orbital of h@xmath1 still exist at the transition state .    in total , the orthogonalizations between molecular orbitals of h@xmath1 and electronic states of mg cause repulsive interactions between electrons of h and mg , and thus will enlarge the total energy of the adsorption system , while the electrons transfer from mg to h@xmath1 causes attractive interactions between h and mg atoms and lowers down the total energy .",
    "so during the adsorption process of h@xmath1 , the total energy of the system firstly goes up , then lowers down .",
    "this analysis explains why an energy barrier is needed for the dissociation of h@xmath1 on the mg(0001 ) surface .",
    "moreover , both the orthogonalizations and electrons transfer are always weaker along the bri-@xmath14 channel than along the bri-@xmath12 channel .",
    "therefore , at the beginning of the adsorption process , when no electrons transfer happens , the total energy of the system is smaller along the bri-@xmath14 channel than along the bri-@xmath12 channel . and at around the transition state , when the h@xmath1 molecule is very close to the mg(0001 ) surface , electrons transfer begins to dominate the molecule - metal interaction .",
    "so the total energy along the bri-@xmath12 channel is smaller at the transition state .",
    "herein , the rotation of h@xmath1 can be seen as the result from the different interactions that respectively favors the bri-@xmath12 and bri-@xmath14 channels . as a result ,",
    "the minimum energy path for the dissociation of h@xmath1 is neither along the bri-@xmath12 nor along the bri-@xmath14 channels .",
    "and the corresponding transition state is the one where h@xmath0 orients 21@xmath18 away from the @xmath10-@xmath14 plane , as shown in fig .",
    "in conclusion , we have systematically studied the pess for the dissociative adsorption of the hydrogen molecule on the mg(0001 ) surface .",
    "our results accord well with previous reports on the direct dissociative adsorption process .",
    "more importantly , we have found that the hydrogen molecule does not always orient parallel to the surface along the dissociation channel with the lowest energy barrier . at large molecular heights , h@xmath0 orients perpendicular to the surface . when getting closer to the surface , h@xmath0 begins to rotate such that at the transition state , h@xmath0 orients 21@xmath18 away from the @xmath10-@xmath14 plane , which causes a @xmath25 mev modification on the dissociation energy barrier .",
    "we have revealed that this molecular rotation is because of the two different interactions between h and mg , i.e. , the orthogonalizations between molecular orbitals of h@xmath1 and electronic states of mg and electrons transfer from the mg(0001 ) surface to the antibonding orbital of h@xmath1 . as a final concluding remark , here based on the present results , we would like to point out that steric effects are important to understand the adsorption behaviors of h@xmath0 on metal surfaces .
