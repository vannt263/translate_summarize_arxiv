    "if nature is described by the standard oscillation scenario , then the hk atmospheric neutrino data will give us the bound @xmath63 at 2.5@xmath36cl from the energy rate analysis , and from the energy spectrum analysis it will restrict @xmath0 to @xmath51 and @xmath52 at 2.5@xmath36 ( 98.8% ) cl for the normal hierarchy and to @xmath53 and @xmath54 at 2.5@xmath36 ( 98.8% ) cl for the inverted hierarchy . on the other hand , if nature is described by nsi with the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) , then hk will measure the nsi parameters @xmath0 and @xmath29 relatively well for @xmath58 in the case of the normal hierarchy and for @xmath59 in the case of the inverted hierarchy .",
