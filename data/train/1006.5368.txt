    "one approach to represent a given state is to express its expansion coefficients in a suitable basis in terms of product of matrices , the so - called matrix product states  @xcite , used before in a wholly different context of 2d classical lattice model  @xcite .",

    "such an ansatz has been used to exactly describe ground states of many low dimensional spin systems , among the first one for instance the aklt chain  @xcite or ladder system  @xcite .",
    "in addition to ground states , description in terms of products of matrices is also successfully used in algorithms for simulation of quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "crucial for the efficiency of such simulation is the necessary matrix dimension @xmath2 .",
    "unfortunately , generic coherent quantum evolution will cause @xmath2 to grow exponentially with the simulation time  @xcite , rendering simulation inefficient .",

    "a matrix product formulation has been utilized in a plethora of models , for a review see  @xcite .",
    "expectations in the ness can sometimes be calculated with the help of algebra only , sometimes though an explicit representation of matrices is required .",
    "it is not known in general when a finite dimensional matrix representation is possible .    in the present work we provide an explicit finite dimensional matrix product solution for a stationary state of quantum system in nonequilibrium situation .",
    "this extends the applicability of matrix product states in quantum domain from ground states and time evolutions to the ness .",
    "the model we consider is a one - dimensional xx spin chain coupled to reservoirs at chain ends . using the jordan - wigner transformation one can reformulate the system in terms of spinless fermions . in the fermionic language",
    "the system is composed of free fermions .",
    "hamiltonian part is therefore trivially integrable .",
    "in fact , for our choice of bath lindblad operators the whole superoperator @xmath3 is quadratic in fermionic operators and can therefore be diagonalized in the operator space  @xcite .",

    "slightly different model resulting in the same solution , in which xx chain repeatedly interacts with independent spins of the bath , has been explicitly solved in  @xcite . for studies of nonequilibrium states in a doubly infinite chain",
    "see  @xcite . our primary goal here is therefore not to solve the system but instead to provide a compact form for the exact ness in terms of a matrix product ansatz with the matrices of low dimension @xmath4 that is independent of the chain length .",

    "such bath operators induce an imbalance in magnetization , causing a flow of magnetization from one to the other end . for bath operators only , the stationary state , for which @xmath17 holds , is diagonal in the eigenbasis of @xmath18 , with the expectation value @xmath19 , and correspondingly for @xmath20 .",

    "matrix representation of superoperators @xmath24 can be found in the  [ sec : appendix ] .",
    "we are interested in a stationary solution of the whole master equation , @xmath25 , which we call a nonequilibrium stationary state , ness for short , and denote simply by @xmath26 .",

    "it has been observed that in a model without dephasing there are no long - range correlations , that is , all connected correlations are zero .",
    "this leads us to think that one could perhaps construct an exact matrix product operator solution just by observing nontrivial one and two - point observables ; in our case these are magnetization , current and @xmath1 correlations . therefore , based on the solution from  @xcite",

    "then we are going to show that such mpo in fact provides an exact soluton , that is , all observables and not just few - point are reproduced correctly . to show this we are going to use the algebraic properties of the matrices found .    in",

    "note that this ansatz is a trivial inhomogeneous extension of a standard procedure used in classical nonequilibrium systems  @xcite .",

    "with an explicit representation of matrix product solution at hand we can evaluate expectations of various operators in the ness .",
    "let us first evaluate expectation of a series of @xmath110 operators , like @xmath111 .",

    "connected correlation function of two @xmath112s is therefore nonzero only on neighboring sites , @xmath119 .",
    "we are now going to show by induction that all higher order connected correlation functions involving more than two @xmath112s are identically zero .",
    "assume that the statement holds for products of upto @xmath14 @xmath112s .",
    "denoting by @xmath120 a product of @xmath14 not - necessarily neighboring @xmath121 , we would like to show that the connected correlation @xmath122 is zero for @xmath123 . assuming connected correlations of more than two @xmath112s are zero , we can write @xmath124 where we denoted by @xmath125 a sum of all products of connected correlations , each involving @xmath126 operators @xmath112 , for instance , @xmath127 .",
    "we used the fact that to have a nonzero connected correlation @xmath128 must be paired with at most one other @xmath129 and that it must be its neighbor ( non nearest - neighbor connected correlations are zero ) . using our explicit mpo representation ( [ eq : mpo ] ) of matrices for @xmath130 and @xmath131 we will now show that the right - hand side of ( [ eq : highz ] ) is zero .",
    "first , observe that the matrix corresponding to the product of matrices occurring in the operator @xmath132 has an upper - left @xmath133 block equal to @xmath134 upper left element is @xmath135 by definition while the upper right follows through a simple multiplication of matrix corresponding to @xmath136 by @xmath137 . with the explicit form of @xmath132 we have @xmath138 where the kronecker delta takes into account multiplication of the matrix for @xmath132 by @xmath139 in the case of non - neighboring sites @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "plugging this into eq.([eq : highz ] ) we see that the @xmath142-point connected correlation of @xmath112 is indeed zero .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "single point expectations @xmath143 and @xmath144 are zero . among two - point expectations on neighboring sites , besides @xmath1 , the only nonzero terms are two from the spin current , that is @xmath145 . therefore , the expectation value of the spin current operator @xmath146 is @xmath147 .",
    "if we have a product of non - overlapping current operators at different sites , @xmath148 ( with @xmath149 ) , the expectation value is simple .",
    "observe that @xmath150 .",
    "because of the form of @xmath131 , if we have a product of only @xmath151s and @xmath152 terms @xmath153 at various sites @xmath154 , their expectation value is simply equal to @xmath155 .",
    "this means that the connected correlation function of non - overlapping operators @xmath156 is zero , @xmath157 , apart from @xmath158 .",
    "if two current operators overlap , i.e. @xmath159 , with the hermitean @xmath160 , the corresponding product of matrices is @xmath161 . from this form ,",
    "similarly as before , we can see that for products of @xmath156 the term @xmath162 is not important , resulting again in all connected correlations being zero .",
    "similar argument holds for products of more than two overlapping current operators .",
    "finally , let us discuss expectations of products of @xmath121 and @xmath163 , the only remaining nonzero terms in the ness . for overlapping sites , @xmath164 ( the same for @xmath165 ) , and we have to consider only non - overlapping operators .",
    "two - point expectation is @xmath166 , connected correlation being therefore @xmath167 .",
    "again , taking into account that if we consider only products of @xmath151 , @xmath137 and @xmath153 , the term @xmath168 in @xmath153 is irrelevant because there are no @xmath169 , @xmath170 or their hermitean conjugates in any of the three matrices .",
    "the expectations are therefore trivial products of scalar quantities in front of @xmath171 terms , resulting in all connected correlations being zero . if we have a product of neighboring currents , like for instance in @xmath172 , similar argument holds .",
    "incidentally , we also see that the expectation of the energy current @xmath173 , such that @xmath174=j_i^{\\rm e}-j_{i+1}^{\\rm e}$ ] , is zero . in the ness with our choice of baths no energy current flows .",
    "another way to write the ness is to rewrite it in terms of an exponential function as @xmath175 .",
    "doing the calculation we observe that the operator @xmath176 contains only few nonzero terms .",
    "these are @xmath110 at all @xmath14 sites ( with different prefactors on different sites ) , spin current @xmath177 at all @xmath178 sites ( the same prefactor on all sites ) as well as @xmath179 , with @xmath180 , and @xmath181 with @xmath182 , where @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "this shows that the ness in the open xx chain can not be exactly written as a quasi - equilibrium generalized gibbs state @xmath185 with locally varying fields @xmath186 , and @xmath187 conserved quantities of the corresponding hamiltonian system  @xcite .",
    "namely , conserved quantities in integrable systems can depend on small changes in the system , for instance on boundary conditions . for 1d xx chain with periodic boundary conditions two infinite sequences of conserved quantities exist , one set are @xmath188 and @xmath189 , another @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "if we change boundary conditions to open , only half of conserved quantities survive , that is , for open boundary conditions conserved quantities are only @xmath192 and @xmath193 , where @xmath194 are additional boundary terms  @xcite .",
    "first few conserved quantities for open xx chain are @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 .",
    "we can see that @xmath176 can not be written as a sum of conserved quantities @xmath199 of an open chain neither that of a periodic one .",
    "a change in the boundary condition can therefore globally influence constants of motion of hamiltonian system .",
    "this sensitivity also translates to open systems described by master equation : a change in boundary operators of the bath can have a large influence on the ness . in short , for open integrable systems there is an ambiguity which `` conserved '' quantities @xmath187 should one use in the generalized gibbs ensemble , or , in other words , the @xmath187 depend on the bath .",
    "such non - universality , where the functional form of ness does not depend only on the hamiltonian but also on reservoirs , is probably generic situation for open versions of integrable systems .    to summarize",
    ", we have shown that all connected correlations , apart from neighboring @xmath200 , are identically zero .",
    "this should not come as a surprise .",
    "in fact , working in fermionic language the system is quadratic , therefore all expectations of products of fermionic operators can be evaluated in terms of two - point expectations using wick s theorem .",
    "we have found an exact solution of an open xx chain in terms of the matrix product ansatz .",
    "an explicit ( @xmath4)-dimensional representation of matrices is found , enabling to evaluate arbitrary expectations .",
    "all connected correlation functions , apart from the correlation function of magnetization at nearest - neighbor sites , are identically zero .",
    "the results presented extend the applicability of matrix product states to quantum nonequilibrium systems .",
    "furthermore , the method of solution is an algebraic one borrowed from the field of classical stochastic processes where it has been used very successfully .",
    "it is hopped that this will lead to new exactly solvable nonequilibrium quantum systems .",
    "one such instance is an open xx chain with dephasing , a solvable diffusive model  @xcite where , based on our experience , a compact matrix product solution is also possible .",
    "unfortunately though , in an even more interesting xxz model the algebra seems to be more complicated .",
    "support by the program p1 - 0044 and the grant j1 - 2208 of the slovenian research agency is acknowledged .",

    "basis elements are ordered as @xmath205 .",
    "matrix representation gives us the operation of @xmath8 on the expansion coefficients of operators in the pauli basis , e.g. , writing @xmath206 , we have @xmath207 , with @xmath208 .",
