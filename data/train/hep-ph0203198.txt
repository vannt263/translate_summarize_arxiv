    "big bang cosmology predicts the existence of a background gas of free photons and neutrinos . the measured cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation supports the applicability of standard cosmology back to photon decoupling which occured approximately one hundred thousand years after the big bang .",
    "the relic neutrinos , on the other hand , have decoupled when the universe had a temperature of one mev and an age of just one second .",
    "thus , a measurement of the relic neutrinos , with a predicted average number density of @xmath3 per light ( @xmath4  mev ) neutrino species @xmath5 , would provide a new window to the early universe .",
    "their predicted number density is comparable to the one of the microwave photons .",
    "however , since neutrinos interact only weakly , the relic neutrinos have not yet been detected directly in laboratory experiments  @xcite .",
    "illustration of a z - burst resulting from the resonant annihilation of an ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrino on a relic ( anti-)neutrino .",
    ", width=188 ]    recently , an indirect detection possibility for relic neutrinos has been discussed  @xcite .",
    "it is based on so - called z - bursts resulting from the resonant annihilation of ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos ( uhec@xmath6s ) with relic neutrinos into @xmath7 bosons  @xcite ( cf .",
    "[ illu ] ) . on resonance ,",
    "the corresponding cross section is enhanced by several orders of magnitudes .",
    "if neutrinos have non - vanishing masses @xmath8  for which there is rather convincing evidence in view of the apparent observation of neutrino oscillations  @xcite  the respective resonance energies , in the rest system of the relic neutrinos , correspond to @xmath9 with @xmath10 denoting the mass of the z boson . these resonance energies are , for neutrino masses of @xmath11 ev , remarkably close to the energies of the highest energy cosmic rays observed at earth by collaborations such as agasa  @xcite , fly s eye  @xcite , haverah park  @xcite , hires  @xcite , and yakutsk  @xcite ( for a review , see ref .",
    "indeed , it was argued  @xcite that the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) above the predicted greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff  @xcite around @xmath12  ev are mainly protons ( and , maybe , photons ) from z decay . in this way ,",
    "one possibly also solves one of the outstanding problems of ultrahigh energy cosmic ray physics  @xcite , namely the apparent observation of cosmic rays with energies above the gzk cutoff , in an elegant and economical way without invoking new physics beyond the standard model , except for neutrino masses .",
    "the gzk puzzle hinges on the fact that nucleons with super - gzk energies have a short attenuation length of about @xmath13  mpc , due to inelastic interactions with the cosmic microwave background , while plausible astrophysical sources for those energetic particles are much farther away  @xcite .",
    "ultrahigh energy neutrinos produced at cosmological distances , on the other hand , can reach the gzk zone unattenuated and their resonant annihilation on the relic neutrinos could just result in the observed cosmic rays of the highest energies .",
    "moreover , at present this annihilation process may be the only way to detect the relic neutrino background , a basic ingredient of our cosmological picture .",
    "the z - burst hypothesis for the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays was discussed in many papers  @xcite .",
    "the required uhec@xmath6 fluxes were estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite for different spectral indices . in ref .",
    "@xcite , particle spectra were determined numerically for case studies which supported the z - burst scenario .",
    "the effect of possible lepton asymmetries was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the analysis of the z - burst mechanism was advocated as one of the few possibilities for an absolute neutrino mass determination .    in the present paper",
    ", we present the details of ( and extend ) our recent quantitative investigation of the z - burst scenario  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) , where we have determined the required mass of the heaviest relic neutrino as well as the necessary ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrino flux via a maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "but before we start this enterprise , we shall briefly review the current knowledge of the absolute scale of neutrino masses .",
    "neutrinos almost certainly have non - vanishing masses and mix .",
    "this follows from the apparent observation of neutrino oscillations whose evidence is compelling for atmospheric neutrinos  @xcite , strong for solar neutrinos  @xcite , and so - far unconfirmed for neutrinos produced in the laboratory and studied by the lsnd collaboration and others  @xcite .",
    "however , neutrino oscillations are sensitive only to the mass ( squared ) splittings @xmath14 , not to the individual masses , @xmath15 , themselves . only a lower bound on the mass of the heaviest neutrino can be derived from these observations , e.g. @xmath16 from the atmospheric mass splitting in a three neutrino flavour scenario and @xmath17 from the still allowed value of the lsnd mass splitting in a four flavour scenario ,",
    "respectively ( for a recent compilation of global analyses on mass splitting and mixing parameters , see for example refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    for an investigation of the absolute scale of neutrino masses",
    "one has to exploit different types of experiments , such as the search for mass imprints in the endpoint spectrum of tritium beta ( @xmath18 ) decay or the search for neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath19 ) decay .",
    "at present , these direct kinematical measurements of neutrino masses provide only upper limits , e.g. @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the leptonic mixing matrix , for the effective mass measured in tritium @xmath18 decay  @xcite , and @xmath22 for the majorana neutrino mass parameter  @xcite appearing in @xmath19 decay . the recently reported evidence for neutrinoless double beta decay and correspondingly deduced parameter range  @xcite @xmath23 has been seriously challenged by refs .",
    "combining the experimental constraints from oscillations and from tritium @xmath18 decay , one infers upper bounds on the mass of the heaviest neutrino  @xcite , @xmath24 in a three flavour , and @xmath25 in a four flavour scenario , respectively .",
    "for further recent investigations of the relationship between oscillation phenomena , @xmath18 decay and @xmath19 decay , in particular with respect to the neutrino mass spectrum , one may also consult refs .",
    "@xcite and references cited therein .",
    "further information on the absolute scale of neutrino masses can be obtained through cosmological and astrophysical considerations .",
    "neutrinos in the @xmath26  ev mass range have cosmological implications since they represent a non - negligible part of dark matter .",
    "this gives the opportunity to put upper limits on neutrino masses from cosmology  @xcite .",
    "analyses of galaxy clustering , including recent cmb measurements and other cosmological constraints , give an upper bound @xmath27 on the sum of the neutrino masses  @xcite . from the spread of arrival times of neutrinos from supernova sn 1987a , coupled with the measured neutrino energies ,",
    "a time - of - flight limit of @xmath28  ev can be derived  @xcite , which , however , is not competitive with the direct limit  ( [ lim_beta ] ) .",
    "it is extremely welcome that the z - burst scenario opens a further and timely window to the absolute neutrino mass scale , since the opportunities to determine this crucial quantity are rare at present .",
    "in addition , its verification would give us an indirect detection of the so elusive relic neutrinos and , finally , offer an explanation of the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "the organization of the present paper is as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : spectra ] we describe our determination of the proton and photon spectra at earth , which originate from z - bursts taking place mainly at extragalactic distances .",
    "we discuss in detail the main ingredients in the predictions of the spectra , such as the details of z production and hadronic decay , the propagation of nucleons and photons through the diffuse extragalactic photon background , the diffuse flux of ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos , and the relic neutrino number density , as well as their anticipated uncertainties .",
    "the comparison of the z - burst spectra with the observed ultrahigh energy cosmic ray spectrum is presented in section  [ sect : determination ] .",
    "the required absolute neutrino mass , as well as the necessary ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrino flux , are determined via a maximum likelihood analysis for various assumptions about the nature of the background of ordinary cosmic rays from unresolved astrophysical sources and variations of the diffuse extragalactic photon background notably in the radio band .",
    "on the basis of these studies we find that the z - burst determinations of the mass of the heaviest neutrino as well as of the neutrino flux are fairly robust .",
    "we find a required neutrino mass range of @xmath0  ev  @xmath1  ev   at the 68% confidence level , if the background of ordinary cosmic rays is of extragalactic origin .",
    "this range narrows down considerably if a particular universal radio background is assumed , e.g. to @xmath0  ev  @xmath2  ev  for a large one . in section  [",
    "sect : discussion ] we discuss the implications of our findings for future laboratory studies such as the tritium beta decay and neutrinoless double beta decay , as well as for astrophysical and cosmological neutrino investigations .",
    "this section contains also our conclusions .",
    "our comparison of the z - burst scenario with the observed uhecr spectrum proceeds as follows .",
    "first , we determine the probability of z production as a function of the distance from earth . secondly , we exploit collider experiments to derive the energy distribution of the produced protons and photons in the laboratory ( lab ) system .",

    "<S> we consider the possibility that a large fraction of the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays are decay products of z bosons which were produced in the scattering of ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos on cosmological relic neutrinos . </S>",

    "<S> we show that the value of the neutrino mass obtained in this way is fairly robust against variations in presently unknown quantities , like the amount of neutrino clustering , the universal radio background , and the extragalactic magnetic field , within their anticipated uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> much stronger systematics arises from different possible assumptions about the diffuse background of ordinary cosmic rays from unresolved astrophysical sources . in the most plausible case that these ordinary cosmic rays are protons of extragalactic origin , </S>",

    "<S> this range narrows down considerably if a particular universal radio background is assumed , e.g. to @xmath0  ev  @xmath2  ev  for a large one . </S>",
    "<S> the required flux of ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos near the resonant energy should be detected in the near future by amanda , rice , and the pierre auger observatory , otherwise the z - burst scenario will be ruled out . </S>"
