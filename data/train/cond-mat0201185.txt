    "recently , shot - noise measurements are emerging as an important tool to obtain information on the transport properties and interactions among carriers in quantum structures @xcite .",
    "since coulomb repulsion between electrons and their fermionic nature can regulate their motion , this effect may be detected in the shot - noise reduction ( in respect to the poissonian value ) , but can not be deduced from time - averaged dc measurements . in particular , shot noise has been used as a tool to probe : fractional charge @xcite , effective superconducting charge @xcite , quantum transmission modes in atomic - size contacts @xcite , mechanisms of tunneling @xcite , etc .",
    "( see , e.g. , recent review @xcite ) .    in this contribution",
    ", we discuss the possibility to employ the shot - noise measurements to obtain information on the energy distribution of nonequilibrium carriers injected from a contact emitter . using ballistic electrons to study nanoscale structures",
    "has recently been a very active research area . in a usual technique called `` hot - electron spectroscopy '' @xcite ,",
    "carriers injected from an emitter contact are analyzed in a collector contact by means of a barrier which is transparent only for the carriers having energy greater than the barrier height . by changing the bias on the collector barrier , the electron energy profile can be analyzed .",
    "this technique requires the design of a special collector filter for getting information on the electron energies .",
    "here , we propose a simpler method which does not require a design of the filter , rather it employs a `` natural '' filter : the potential barrier that appears due to an injected space charge .",
    "this space charge limits the current producing the resistance effect by means of a barrier , which reflects a part of the injected carriers back to the emitter .",
    "the height of the barrier depends on the screening parameter of the material , and it varies with the external bias .",
    "the essential difference with the case of a fixed barrier is that the space - charge barrier fluctuates in time and produces the long - range coulomb correlations between the transmitted electrons , that leads to the significant suppression of shot noise registered at the collector contact .",
    "the level of suppression depends drastically on the energy profile of the injected carriers @xcite , while the time - averaged quantities ( the mean current , conductance , etc . )",
    "do not .",
    "we consider the current injection into a ballistic conductor at high biases ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "to adequately describe the transport and noise under the nonlinear far - from - equilibrium conditions , one has to solve the transport equation coupled self - consistently with a poisson equation @xcite .",
    "the self - consistent built - in field determines the potential barrier @xmath0 , at which electrons are either reflected or transmitted depending on their energy .",
    "the steady - state ballistic current @xmath1 is determined by the electrons passed over the barrier ( tunneling is neglected ) :",
    "@xmath2    where @xmath3 is the electron charge , @xmath4 is the number of occupied transversal modes , @xmath5 is the cross - sectional area , @xmath6 is the dimension of a momentum space and @xmath7 is the occupation number of a quantum state of a longitudinal energy @xmath8 and a transverse momentum @xmath9 at the emitter .",
    "note that the differential conductance for this kind of emitter is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the coulomb interaction factor dependent on the bias @xmath12 and the length of the ballistic region @xmath13 .",
    "since there is no scattering , the occupation of transversal modes is conserved during the motion , and the only source of noise is the fluctuations of the occupation numbers at the emitter modulated by the potential - barrier fluctuations @xmath14 .",
    "the barrier fluctuations induce the long - range coulomb correlations , and they are found from the poisson equation @xcite .",
    "the result may be summarized by introducing the current - fluctuation transfer function @xmath15 as follows :    @xmath16 \\quad = \\quad \\frac{q}{2\\pi\\hbar } \\int_{\\phi_b}^{\\infty } \\gamma(\\varepsilon)\\   \\delta n(\\varepsilon)\\ d\\varepsilon.\\ ] ]    as a result of the long - range coulomb interactions , the transmission for different energies differs by the factor @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the low - frequency current - noise spectral density is    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is given through the correlator @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the frequency bandwidth .",
    "at high biases @xmath21 , we find the asymptotic formula for the function @xmath22    @xmath23 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath24    it is important to highlight that the current noise ( [ si ] ) depends on the details of the distribution function @xmath25 at the emitter through the parameter @xmath26 .",
    "the function @xmath15 plays the role of the energy - resolved shot - noise suppression factor .",
    "to illustrate the implementation of the results , we consider the emitter in which the injection energy profile has a peak at energy @xmath27 superimposed on a wide background of 3d fermi - dirac ( fd ) electrons ( see inset in fig .  2 ) .",
    "under the assumption that the width of the peak is narrow on the scale of the temperature @xmath28 , the number of the occupied modes for each longitudinal energy @xmath8 can be written as      where @xmath30 is the fermi energy , and @xmath31 is the dimensionless peak magnitude .",
    "it is known that the mean current for ballistic injection in the limit of high biases is described by the child law independently of the distribution function @xcite . for the distribution ( [ nfd ] ) , the steady - state current ( [ i ] ) is obtained as ( @xmath32 is assumed )      where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and we denote the fermi - dirac integrals of index @xmath37 by @xmath38^{-1 } dx/\\gamma(j+1)$ ] .",
    "it is seen that the information on the peak position @xmath27 is lost in the time - averaged current @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , the noise is sensitive to both the peak position and its magnitude , as will be shown below .            where @xmath42=@xmath43 is the background current , @xmath44 , @xmath45=@xmath46 is the ratio between the current of the peak and the current of the background , @xmath47=@xmath48 and @xmath49=@xmath50 are the coefficients dependent on the degree of degeneracy of injected electrons ( @xmath47=@xmath49=1 at high temperatures for nondegenerate electrons ) , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the positions of the fermi energy and the @xmath53 peak with respect to the potential barrier .",
    "the current noise ( [ sifd ] ) has a form of a shot noise suppressed by coulomb interactions .",
    "the suppression is enhanced with the bias @xmath12 and depends on the details of the injected distribution , in particular on the peak parameters @xmath45 and @xmath54 .",
    "note that for noninteracting carriers ( @xmath22=@xmath55 ) , one gets @xmath56 , that means the information on the peak position is lost , in a similar way as for the average current ( [ ifd ] ) .",
    "for this case the noise is a sum of two shot - noise terms : the first one is multiplied by the factor @xmath49 ( fermi suppressed poissonian shot noise @xcite ) , and the second one is the poissonian noise from the @xmath53 peak .",
    "thus , the role of the coulomb interactions is crucial in providing an additional information on the injected carriers .",
    "it is seen that the parameter @xmath58 is a nonmonotonic function of the peak position .",
    "we have studied the behavior of @xmath58 when the peak position @xmath54 and the peak current @xmath45 are varied .",
    "the results are illustrated in fig .",
    "2 . for a fixed @xmath45",
    ", each curve displays a minimum at some energy correspondent approximately to the energy @xmath59 , where the current - fluctuation transfer function vanishes : @xmath60=0 .",
    "since the barrier height @xmath0 is a function of the applied bias , one can tune by @xmath12 the @xmath53 peak position to @xmath61 where the noise is minimal , thereby revealing the peak position . in the opposite case , when the peak position is given",
    ", one may get information on the screening parameter at the space - charge barrier .      summarizing , we have shown that coulomb interactions in ballistic structures are of interest from several points of view : on the one hand , they lead to the shot - noise suppression that may be important for applications . on the other hand",
    ", they give the possibility to use the shot - noise measurements as a tool to deduce an important information on the properties of nonequilibrium carriers in nanoscale structures with hot - electron emitters , resonant - tunneling - diode emitters , superlattice emitters , etc .",
