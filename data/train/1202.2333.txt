    "what are the consequences of breaking a schrdinger wave ? in a seminal paper @xcite , moshinsky studied the evolution problem of a quantum - mechanical wave blocked by a shutter and identified his results with fresnel diffraction . since then , the so - called diffraction in time has been widely studied @xcite , and experimentally pursued @xcite .",
    "needless to say , the spatial side of the analogy ( in the paraxial approximation @xcite ) has a long tradition of its own , mostly in the context of electromagnetic theory @xcite .",
    "it is rarely recognized , however , that the discontinuities of the initial condition are the true origin of schrdinger diffraction as well as the peculiar intensity patterns accompanying the effect .",
    "the present paper delves into the subject by revealing its mathematical structure through the use of symmetries and self - similar relations obeyed by wave functions .",
    "it is shown that the afore mentioned patterns in space and time can be explained in a very general framework dealing with the evolution of discontinuous initial conditions .",
    "the role of symmetry in these quantum - mechanical problems will be crucial , as its influence in the evolution of the system shall give rise to non - classical trajectories of constant probability .",
    "although diffractive effects are described by old and simple wave theories , the underlying explanation of the complexity in the emerging patterns is a subject of current discussion @xcite and the resulting intricacies are the center of attention of other studies in connection with fractality @xcite .",
    "it is worth to mention that the study of discontinuities in quantum - mechanical wave functions is also motivated by current physical applications ranging from molecular talbot interferometers @xcite to matter - wave optics based on cold atoms @xcite .",
    "structure of the paper : in the following section , we study the old problem of diffraction by edges , in order to show all the relevant features of patterns by means of elementary techniques , including self - similarity and caustics . in section 3",
    "we present a generalization of the method and illustrate it with a few examples in section 4 .",
    "these include the diffraction of a square packet in a parametric harmonic oscillator , the evolution of discontinuities under non - linear canonical evolution and their relation to wavelet expansions . as a final example",
    ", the evolution of a discontinuous packet under the gross - pitaevskii equation is shown numerically . in section 5",
    "we give a brief conclusion .",
    "it is usually considered that , in the paraxial approximation , the problem of diffraction by edges in the @xmath2 plane can be described by a plane wave in @xmath3 propagating parallel to the @xmath4 axis , a discontinuous opaque screen placed at @xmath5 parallel to the @xmath6 axis and the corresponding solution at @xmath3 , subject to the boundary conditions mentioned before .",
    "the solution at @xmath3 can be found by propagating the wave at @xmath5 , which is taken as the original plane wave but forced to vanish at the blocking screen a discontinuous initial condition . in the following",
    "we solve the corresponding schrdinger propagation problem in natural units ( @xmath7 ) using the time variable @xmath8 instead of @xmath4 .",
    "we have ( x , t)= i , ( x,0 ) = _ 0(x ) [ 0.1 ] where @xmath9 has , in principle , an arbitrary number of discontinuities .",
    "see the single - slit example in figure [ cero ] .",
    "probability density as a function of space and time .",
    "two regions can be distiguished : 1 ) the near zone or short - time regime , where infinite oscillations and a main lobe can be identified , and 2 ) the far zone or long - time regime , where the wave function spreads ]    let us consider a variant of the problem treated by moshinsky @xcite , revisited by nussenzveig @xcite .",
    "consider the intial condition    ( x , t=0 ) = ( 1/2-|x| ) [ uno ] corresponding to a square packet of unit width .",
    "the wave function at time @xmath8 can be obtained via the free propagator @xcite , which is a gaussian of the form    k(x , x;t,0 ) = ( ) .",
    "[ prop ] the wavefunction reads    ( x , t ) = - . [ tres ] in this form we can obtain the intensity pattern in space and time , as shown in figure [ cero ] .",
    "it is worth to mention that the properties of such a pattern can be inferred from the cornu spiral , as it was pointed out long ago @xcite .",
    "however , the applicability of this geometrical picture is restricted to the appearence of fresnel integrals in the solution .",
    "more general initial conditions demand the use of more powerful methods .",
    "the origin of a self - similar pattern near the edges of the initial condition can be described alternatively by a _ replication formula  _ , a relation describing the wave function in terms of itself . using a trigonometric expansion of the initial condition    ( 1/2-|x| ) = + _ n=0^ ( ( 2n+1 ) ( x+1/2 ) ) [ 4 ] and applying the gaussian propagator to this expansion",
    ", we can prove in a very simple way the identity    = _",
    "n=0^ c_n e^i _ n(x , t ) [ aa ] where we have used the definitions k_n=(2n+1 ) , c_n = 1/i k_n + _ n(x , t ) = -k_n^2 t/2 + k_n(1/2 + x ) + _ n(x , t ) = e^-i3/2 ( 1/2 - x - k_n t)/ .",
    "[ bb ] here we can infer the shape of the pattern near the edges by using a short time approximation of the functions on the r.h.s . of ( [ aa ] ) .",
    "we simply take the individual packets to be the initial conditions whose argument is displaced according to @xmath10 , that is    ( x , t ) & = & _ n=0^ c_n + & + & ( 1/2-|x| ) + o(t^2 ) [ 13 ] where @xmath11 is a small correction for short times .",
    "it is interesting to note that in this expansion , the emergence of the pattern in space time can be seen as the superposition of many individual square packets moving along the trajectories @xmath12 , with plane wave factors propagating along @xmath13 .",
    "the alternate signs indicate the contribution from each discontinuity or edge , while the index @xmath14 parameterizes the velocity .",
    "this velocity also alternates sign according to the source of the rays , propagating to the left from the right edge and vice versa .",
    "the individual functions preserving their integrity on the r.h.s . of ( [ 13 ] ) can be regarded as building blocks , while the coefficients @xmath15 weight the contribution of each block . for the resulting probability density plots ,",
    "see figures [ fig : once ] , [ fig : doce ] , [ fig : trece ] .",
    "furthermore , the building blocks can be replaced by any other localized shape such as that of a gaussian or a tringular packet , and the resulting pattern generated by them will have the same features .",
    "see , in particular , figure [ fig : trece ] .",
    "we distiguish the following properties :    * when the limit of the sums is truncated ( say @xmath16 ) , the pattern has a finite number of oscillations near the discontinuities . *",
    "the second term @xmath17 shows already a main peak : the original pattern to be replicated .",
    "increasing @xmath14 implies finer detail in the pattern near the edges .",
    "* rays are described by @xmath18 .",
    "the envelopes of such system of rays are caustics ( legendre transform ) and can be obtained by eliminating @xmath14 from the condition @xmath19 .",
    "it turns out that such envelopes are parabolas centered at the edges",
    ". see figure [ fig : diez ] .",
    "* classical methods from geometric optics produce a non - classical result . to this respect",
    "we should point out that the trajectories of ( approximately ) constant probability obtained from the caustics should not be interpreted as classical trajectories .",
    "in free evolution , the latter are simply rays , while the former are parabolas . *",
    "the short time approximation used in ( [ 13 ] ) can always be improved .",
    "for example , in the case of initial space dependent phases , a velocity field given by the gradient of the phase produces additional motion on the initial packets or building blocks . using the continuity equation for the initial probability density , one can infer the specific form of the motion and obtain the correct approximation .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     a brief explanation of the effect in question can be given in terms of the gross - pitaevskii equation plus the previously obtained replication formula for free evolution .",
    "for @xmath20 we have ( x , t ) = _ n=0^",
    "c_n e^ik_n^2 t/2e^ik_n(x1/2 ) _ 0(x k_n t ) + o(t^2 ) . [ replication ]",
    "the non - linear potential can be incorporated in the evolution by means of the interaction picture . for short times and non - vanishing coupling ,",
    "we have that the corresponding operator can be replaced by a simple phase factor in the propagation problem .",
    "this is indicated in the following expression .",
    "_ g(x , t ) & = & _ -^ dx k(x , x;t,0 ) e^-igt |_0(x)|^2 _ 0(x ) + o(t^2 ) + [ grosspitaevskii ] which is in the form of schrdinger propagation with an _ effective  _ initial condition @xmath21 .",
    "the intitially space - dependent phases produce additional focusing or defocusing in the previously obtained patterns ( linear case ) . in the case of positive coupling @xmath22",
    "we expect defocusing , preceded by a self - similar regime whose duration is shorter than in the free case .",
    "in this contribution , devoted to the role of symmetries and self - similarity in diffraction patterns , we have shown that the schrdinger evolution of discontinuities can be described by a wave function in terms of itself .",
    "this gave rise to a replicating pattern near the edges of an initial distribution .",
    "the notion of replication can be extended to other parabolic equations , including non - linear terms .",
    "a formal theory of the present treatment is to be developed : envelope curves live in manifolds , rays in the exponents live in tangent spaces .",
    "it has been stressed that the symmetry groups producing the evolution in phase space _ induce  _ transformations of wavepackets through the exponentiation of the evolved coordinate operators .",
    "it is desirable to find all these patterns in experimental setups , either using classical light , or the more ambitious manipulation of bose - einstein condensates .",
    "the current technology suggests @xcite that the needed edges in the initial distributions can be produced under special configurations of the confining electromagnetic traps    the author is indebted to stefan arnold , william case and manuel goncalves for fruitful discussions . financial support from the dlr project quantus",
