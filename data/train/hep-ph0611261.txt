    "neutrino oscillation physics is now entering the era of precision experiments  @xcite .",
    "the main aim of the upcoming generation of experiments will be to establish a non - zero value of the mixing angle @xmath1 or to push further the bound . on a time scale of 5 to 10 years decisions on a subsequent generation of high precision neutrino oscillation facilities",
    "will have to been taken , and currently active investigations on comparing various options are performed  @xcite . along these lines , in this talk i consider three particular setups which are comparable in size and time scale , namely two cern based neutrino oscillation experiments consisting of a beta beam ( @xmath2b )  @xcite with @xmath0 and a superbeam ( spl )  @xcite , as well as the phase ii of the t2k experiment in japan ( t2hk )  @xcite .",
    "all three configurations use a mt scale water erenkov detector  @xcite : memphys  @xcite at frjus or the hyper - kamiokande  @xcite detector in japan .",
    "the main characteristics of the setups are displayed in tab .",
    "[ tab : setups ] .",
    "the results presented here are based on the work  @xcite , where details on the calculations , references , and more physics results and discussions can be found .",
    ".summary of default parameters used for the simulation of the @xmath2b , spl , and t2hk experiments . for the @xmath2b",
    "the beam intensity is given in @xmath3(@xmath4 ) decays / yr.[tab : setups ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "as performance indicators for the considered experiments we use the potential to establish a non - zero value of @xmath1 and the sensitivity to cp violation ( cpv ) . the @xmath1 sensitivity is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sens ] ( left ) as a function of the value of the cp phase @xmath5 : above the curves @xmath6 can be excluded at more than 3@xmath7 cl ( i.e. , with @xmath8 ) , whereas fig .",
    "[ fig : sens ] ( right ) shows the region in the @xmath9 plane where cpv can be established at 3@xmath7 .",
    "one finds from these plots that spl and t2hk perform rather similar .",
    "in fact , the experimental setups of these two configurations are similar ( superbeam technology , multi - mw beam power , detector , @xmath10 ) , the main differences being the shorter baseline of spl which implies lower neutrino energies ( compare tab .  [",
    "tab : setups ] ) , as well as the use of an on - axis ( off - axis ) configuration for spl ( t2hk ) .",
    "the lower energies for spl imply that the cross section is completely dominated by quasi - elastic ( qe ) scattering which allows a good reconstruction of the neutrino energy , whereas at t2hk energies non - qe events contribute significantly . on the other hand in the low energy regime fermi motion",
    "becomes important which limits energy reconstruction . in our analysis",
    "we have taken these issues into account by a migration matrix between true and reconstructed neutrino energies based on detailed event simulations  @xcite .    within our standard setup",
    "the @xmath2b  performs clearly better than the superbeams . for the @xmath2b",
    "a crucial parameter is the total number of ion decays .",
    "the conservative numbers from the eurisol @xmath2bstudies  @xcite , which are two times smaler than our standard values , lead to the sensitivites shown as dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : sens ] .",
    "the widths of the curves in the figures shows the effect of varying the ( uncorrelated ) systematical uncertainties on signal and backgrounds between 2% and 5% .",
    "one can see that the @xmath2b  is practically unaffected , whereas the superbeam performances , and in particular the one of t2hk , depend to some extent on the systematics .",
    "the relevant systematic in this respect is the uncertainty on the background . in the @xmath2b",
    "the most important background comes from pions produced mainly in nc @xmath11 interactions which are misidentified as muons .",
    "this background is efficiently reduced by requiring to see the michel electron from the muon decay . after applying all the cuts roughly 300 background events remain .",
    "the reason why an uncertainty on this number has so little impact for the @xmath2b  is that the background has a very different shape than the signal . as visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] it is peaked at low energies and therefore spectral information makes the @xmath2b  very insensitive to the systematical uncertainty .",
    "in contrast , for the superbeams the background comes mainly from the intrinsic @xmath11 component of the beam and has a spectral shape rather similar to the signal , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] for the spl .",
    "therefore spectral information is not as efficient to distinguish the background from the signal , as in the case of the @xmath2b .",
    "b  ( bottom).[fig : spectra],scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "in analyses of long - baseline experiments parameter degeneracies play an important role .",
    "there are three types of degeneracies  @xcite , traditionally referred to as intrinsic- , octant- , and sign(@xmath12)-degeneracy . for the experiments discussed here the intrinsic degeneracy",
    "is resolved by spectral information but the degeneracies related to the octant of @xmath13 and the neutrino mass hierarchy are present and lead to ambiguities in the determination of @xmath1 and @xmath5 .",
    "however , thanks to the fact that the matter effect is rather small ( due to the relatively short baselines ) the degeneracies have very little impact on the sensitivity to cpv . in other words , if the true parameter values are cp violating also the parameter values of the degenerate solutions will be cp violating .",
    "moreover , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite atmospheric neutrino data in mt scale water erenkov detectors as considered here can be used to resolve degeneracies ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . by combining long - baseline and atmospheric data the mass hierarchy can be identified at @xmath14  cl provided @xmath15 , although none of the considered experiments has sensitivity to the hierarchy from long - baseline data alone .",
    "furthermore , atmospheric data provides sensitivity to the octant of @xmath13 , and if combined with the @xmath16 disappearance chanel available in the superbeam experiments there is sensitivity to the octant for @xmath17 .",
