    "the @xmath0-extension problem that we will consider can be formulated in a vague way as follows .",
    "let @xmath1 be the zero set of a generically transverse holomorphic section @xmath2 of a hermitian vector bundle @xmath3 over an almost stein manifold and let @xmath4 be a hermitian line bundle satisfying suitable curvature conditions with respect to the curvature of @xmath3 and a quasi - plurisubharmonic weight @xmath5 .",
    "then any holomorphic section of @xmath6 satisfying a certain @xmath0-condition with respect to @xmath5 admits an extension with uniform @xmath0-estimate .",
    "the classic situation , which has been first considered in @xcite , and successively in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , is when the hermitian bundle @xmath3 is the flat bundle @xmath7 and @xmath8 is a bounded pseudoconvex domain .",
    "the situations considered in @xcite and @xcite are reduced by the authors to this particular case . in all this",
    "works it is sufficient to prove first the result in the case the weight function @xmath5 is smooth and then to extract a weak limit solution .",
    "this is always possible by the uniformity of the @xmath0-estimate satisfied by the holomorphic extensions .    in this particular case",
    "there is no trouble with the regularising process of @xmath5 since the curvature assumptions reduces to the pseudoeffectivness of @xmath4 .",
    "we give a simple proof of this classic case in the appendix .",
    "however this is not needed in our proof of the general geometric case , so the reader not interested with this particular case can skip this part .    in the case",
    "@xmath3 is not hermitian trivial the lost of positivity in the curvature conditions occur even in the case @xmath3 is holomorphically trivial and @xmath8 is a ball .",
    "this is due to the presence of the singular weight produced from the section @xmath2 in the curvature hypothesis . in the case",
    "@xmath9 there is no way known so far , of regularising a quasi - plurisubharmonic function @xmath5 by producing an arbitrary small lost of positivity of the current @xmath10 even in restriction of the complete khler manifold @xmath11 . in the case",
    "@xmath12 the regularisation process produces an arbitrary small lost of positivity of the current @xmath13 all over @xmath11 .",
    "this is possible by the lelong - poincar formula .    on the other hand by replacing @xmath14 with @xmath15 in the definition of @xmath13 one loses a fixed amount of positivity over an open set @xmath16 , depending on the curvature of @xmath3 .",
    "this lost of positivity can be handled by applying a new perturbation method ( inspired from the perturbation method introduced in @xcite ) to the standard @xmath0-theory .",
    "this local picture is very close to the case when @xmath8 is a projective variety since by subtracting a hyperplane section @xmath17 to @xmath8 one can cover @xmath18 by an increasing family of coordinate pseudoconvex open sets . in the subsection [ loc - proj ]",
    "we explain how our general positivity estimate simplifies in the particular local or projective case .",
    "our proof of the general global case ( see the main theorem [ ext - tm ] in section [ sng - ext - rst ] ) is based in large part on the previous works @xcite , @xcite in which the authors consider the global geometric context without the presence of the singularities . in our global and singular case",
    "there is an extra lost of positivity due to the singularities of the weight @xmath5 . by replacing the current @xmath13 with the current @xmath19 @xmath20",
    "we introduce a fixed lost of positivity over an arbitrary small neighborhood of the poles @xmath21 our new perturbed @xmath0-method requires only the regularisation of the bounded quasi - plurisubharmonic functions @xmath22 , which is a substantially simpler task than the general case considered in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an other difficulty is that we can not let @xmath23 directly in the process of weak limits extraction .",
    "the reason is due to the fact that the starting holomorphic extension produced by standard @xmath0-methods is not @xmath0 with respect to the weight @xmath5 .",
    "for this reason we need first to construct a holomorphic @xmath24-extension .",
    "this is possible since the almost stein condition provides an arbitrary large amount of positivity @xmath25 required to absorb the error therm produced by the extension obtained by local gluing .",
    "however the holomorphic @xmath24-extension @xmath26 constructed in this way does not satisfy an uniform @xmath0-estimate .",
    "the estimate obtained in this way blows up when the shape of the domains involved in the exhaustion increases .",
    "the extension with uniform @xmath0-estimate is constructed by applying the previous @xmath27-weak limit extraction process with initial extension @xmath26 .",
    "allowing singularities requires a condition on the weight @xmath5 with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "this condition is always satisfied for quasi - plurisubharmonic weights of analytic type plus a continuous rest .",
    "we wish to point out that the regularising process in @xcite produces only approximations of analytic type plus a bounded rest , which can be made smooth only after blow - ups .",
    "moreover in the case @xmath28 the subtle game of positivity lost and weak limit extraction does not allow to approximate a general weight @xmath5 in order to avoid the singularity condition with respect to @xmath1 . as previously suggested the extension result in the case @xmath8 projective and @xmath29 can be obtained ( see subsection [ loc - proj ] ) by slightly modifying the arguments in @xcite , @xcite . in this and other particular situations ( see subsection [ loc - proj ] ) the singularity condition on the weight is not needed .    in the last section we establish as corollaries some extension results for pluri - twisted holomorphic sections of singular hermitian line bundles over projective manifolds .",
    "we are able to perform our extensions from singular varieties under an integrability assumption .",
    "the technique we use has been invented by siu @xcite , @xcite and drastically simplified in @xcite .",
