    ", we choose to study only structures of single domain proteins .",
    "although these proteins are well known to be compact @xcite , and their interior is frequently thought to be solid - like @xcite , recent calculations showed that there are also numerous voids buried in the protein interior @xcite .",
    "the importance of tight packing in single chain protein is widely appreciated : packing is thought to be important for protein stability @xcite , for kinetic nucleation of protein folding @xcite , and for successful design of novel proteins following a predefined backbone @xcite .",
    "the conservation of amino acid residues during evolution may also be correlated with tightly packed sites @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the potential roles of voids in affecting protein stability and in influencing tolerance to mutations and designability of proteins @xcite are not well understood .",
    "an important parameter describing packing is the packing density @xmath1 , which is a quantitative measure of the voids and was first introduced to study proteins by structural biologists .",
    "this concept has been widely used in protein chemistry @xcite .",
    "the scaling relationship of @xmath1 and chain length @xmath2 was first studied in reference @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 can be thought of as the physical volume @xmath3 occupied by the union of van der wall atoms , divided by the volume of an envelope @xmath4 that tightly wraps around the body of atoms : @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "voids contained within the molecule will not be part of the van der waals volume @xmath3 , but will be included in @xmath4 . using geometric algorithms , @xmath6 and @xmath1 can be readily computed for protein structures in the protein data bank @xcite .    in this work , we further study the scaling behavior of packing density @xmath1 with chain length of single domain proteins and explore the determinants of the observed scaling behavior .",
    "we seek to answer the following questions : is the scaling behavior of @xmath1 unique to proteins ?",
    "are proteins optimized during evolution to eliminate packing voids ?",
    "we introduce two new packing parameters @xmath7 ( the alpha contact number ) and @xmath8 ( the alpha coordination number ) .",
    "we show that @xmath7 characterizes protein packing very well with a linear scaling relationship with the chain length , and that a widely used parameter , the radius of gyration @xmath9 , characterizes protein packing poorly . to overcome the attrition problem of low success rate in generating compact long chain polymers",

    "we first describe briefly how @xmath1 and @xmath7 are computed from the dual simplicial complex of protein structure , and introduce an off - lattice discrete model for generating random polymer conformations .",
    "we next describe the sequential monte carlo importance sampling and resampling techniques that allow us to generate adequate samples satisfying various criteria of @xmath7 . in the results section ,",
    "we begin with the characterization of void properties of proteins by both @xmath1 and @xmath9 .",

    "we then obtain the dual simplicial complex of the protein molecule by removing any tetrahedra , triangles , and edges whose corresponding voronoi vertices , edges , and planar facets are not fully contained within the protein molecule @xcite .",
    "the edges between atoms that are not connected by bonds corresponds to nonbonded alpha contacts .",

    "fcc packing has recently been proved to have the tightest packing @xcite . because the distance between two balls in canonical fcc packing is @xmath28  , which is greater than the bond length 1.5  , we shorten the distance along bonds connecting contacting balls of radius 1.7  to 1.5  .",
    "this mimics the bond length of the model polymer . unlike fcc packing of hard spheres , bonded monomers here",
    "are allowed to have volume overlaps . additionally , there are some boundary effects because bonds connecting balls in different layer have a distance @xmath29  .",
    "although mathematically unproven , we conjecture that this artificially constructed polymer represents conformations of saws that have very close to maximum compactness .",
    "the packing density of canonical fcc packing by our method is 0.74 @xcite . as described earlier , although fcc packing contains no voids , there are packing crevices or dead spaces that do contribute to the calculation of @xmath1 by our definition @xcite . in approximately maximum compact polymer , because the distance between bonded balls is shorter than that in fcc packing , @xmath1 can be as high as 0.80 for polymers with a range of chain length .    _ importance sampling with sequential monte carlo . _ since we are simulating compact conformations that resemble proteins , we need an efficient method to generate adequate number of conformations satisfying protein - like compactness criteria . here",

    "we identify the monomer @xmath41 that is the nearest neighbor with the shortest euclidean distance @xmath42 to @xmath38 .",
    "we require in addition that the sequence separation @xmath43 so @xmath41 and @xmath35 are not sequence near neighbors .",

    "both duplicate chains will then continue to grow , and the final two surviving chains will be correlated up to the duplication event .",

    "it is well acknowledged that protein has high packing density @xmath1 , as high as that of crystalline solids @xcite .",
    "however , recent study suggested that there are numerous voids and pockets in proteins @xcite .",
    "it was also found that about 1/3 of the residues in a protein deviates from the fcc close packing and have random positions @xcite .",
    "the simulation results presented here indicate that chain connectivity , excluded volume , and global compactness are the main determinants of the scaling behavior of voids and chain length in proteins .",

    "however , not all parameters related to voids and compactness are equally appropriate .",
    "the data shown in fig  [ fig:2 ] suggests that the alpha coordination number @xmath8 reflects basic intrinsic compactness properties of protein , which is absent in the widely used parameter @xmath9 , the radius of gyration .",

    "<S> _ single domain proteins are thought to be tightly packed . </S>",

    "<S> we find that the radius of gyration provides poor description of protein packing but the alpha contact number we introduce here characterize proteins well . </S>",
    "<S> we further demonstrate that protein - like scaling relationship between packing density and chain length is observed in off - lattice self - avoiding walks . </S>",
    "<S> a key problem in studying compact chain polymer is the attrition problem : it is difficult to generate independent samples of compact long self - avoiding walks . </S>",
    "<S> we develop an algorithm based on the framework of sequential monte carlo and succeed in generating populations of compact long chain off - lattice polymers up to length @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> results based on analysis of these chain polymers suggest that maintaining high packing density is only characteristic of short chain proteins . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the scaling behavior of packing density with chain length of proteins is a generic feature of random polymers satisfying loose constraint in compactness . </S>",
