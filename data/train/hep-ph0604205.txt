    "a correlator of an axial and two vector currents @xmath0 is a peculiar object . because of its relation to the anomaly of the axial current , it plays important role in understanding subtle issues in quantum field theory and in certain phenomenological applications .",
    "one such application was recently identified in the physics of the muon anomalous magnetic moment where calculation of two - loop electroweak corrections requires the correlator @xmath0 , fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "thanks to furry theorem , the vector part of the @xmath1 coupling to fermions does not contribute and the diagram fig.[fig1 ] is entirely determined by the @xmath0 correlator . because of significant interest in the physics of the muon anomalous magnetic moment , driven by recent measurements @xcite of this observable at brookhaven national laboratory , it is not surprising that the two - loop electroweak corrections to the muon magnetic anomaly were studied thoroughly .",
    "in particular , the influence of hadronic effects on electroweak corrections to the muon anomalous magnetic moment was discussed in a number of recent papers @xcite . while these activities resulted in a better understanding of hadronic effects in the physics of the muon anomalous magnetic moment",
    ", they also lead to a discovery of an interesting theoretical result  a novel non - renormalization theorem for the @xmath2 correlator @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the content of this theorem can be explained as follows . in a special kinematic configuration when one of the vector currents is soft , the correlator of an axial and two vector currents is described by the longitudinal and transversal functions @xmath3 . in the chiral limit",
    ", @xmath4 does not receive qcd corrections as a consequence of the adler - bardeen theorem on the non - renormalization of the axial anomaly @xcite .",
    "the new result , discovered by vainshtein @xcite , is that in the chiral limit the transversal function is also not renormalized by perturbative qcd effects .",
    "the proof is based on the observation that in the chiral limit @xmath5 , to all orders in the strong coupling constant @xmath6 . since the adler - bardeen theorem protects @xmath4 from qcd corrections , the transversal function @xmath7 is also not renormalized .",
    "we note that these non - renormalization theorems @xcite are formulated in the chiral limit .",
    "recently , pasechnik and teryaev claimed @xcite that these results are more general and that even for massive quarks @xmath8 qcd corrections to the longitudinal and transversal functions are absent .",
    "this result looks somewhat peculiar ; for example , it is difficult to reconcile the absence of @xmath8 corrections with other well - known properties @xcite of the correlator @xmath2 , in particular its operator product expansion . intrigued by",
    "that , we decided to re - calculate the qcd corrections to the @xmath0 correlator in the limit when one of the vector currents is soft , allowing for non - zero quark masses .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we obtain non - vanishing qcd corrections away from the chiral limit . below the details of the calculation",
    "are described .",
    "consider the correlator of an axial and two vector currents @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the vector and axial currents and @xmath11 is the electric charge of the quark @xmath12 .",
    "the pole mass of the quark is denoted by @xmath13 in what follows .",
    "we assume that momentum @xmath14 is much smaller than @xmath15 and view the current @xmath16 as a source of soft photons .",
    "then , we can write @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the polarization vector of a photon with momentum @xmath14 .      in general , @xmath23 depend on @xmath24 and the quark mass @xmath13 . in the one - loop approximation ,",
    "these functions were computed in @xcite @xmath25 & = \\frac{2 n_c q_q^2}{q^{2}}\\ , \\big(1-\\frac{2m_q^{2}}{\\beta q^{2}}\\ln\\frac{\\beta+1}{\\beta -1}\\big ) \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq5 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] in eq.([eq5 ] ) , @xmath26 is the number of colors .",
    "we also introduced the euclidean momentum @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in the limit @xmath30 ,",
    "we find @xmath31 ; as follows from the adler - bardeen and vainshtein s theorems @xcite , this is exact perturbative result in that all qcd corrections to it vanish .    in this paper , we study @xmath8 qcd corrections to @xmath32 in case when the quark mass is not zero .",
    "we have to compute twelve two - loop diagrams ; some examples are shown in fig.[fig2 ] . because computing @xmath22 beyond the one - loop approximation for arbitrary value of @xmath33 is technically challenging , we adopt a different approach .",
    "it turns out that the calculation is drastically simplified in two limiting cases @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "in addition , if sufficiently many terms in the expansion of @xmath22 in these limits are known , we can reconstruct the two functions completely using pad approximation .    for both cases , @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    ", we employ the method of asymptotic expansions @xcite . in the large - mass limit ,",
    "@xmath36 , the computation is particularly simple since taylor expansion of feynman diagrams in fig.[fig2 ] in both @xmath14 and @xmath27 suffices .",
    "consequently , only two - loop vacuum feynman integrals have to be evaluated in this case .",
    "the small mass limit @xmath37 is more complex , since taylor expansion in @xmath13 is insufficient .",
    "this can be seen from the one loop result which is non - analytic in the limit @xmath38 . to expand the two - loop diagrams , fig.[fig2 ] , in @xmath13",
    ", we have to consider how a loop momentum @xmath39 , flowing along a line in a diagram , compares with @xmath13 and @xmath27 . if @xmath40 , the propagator is taylor expanded in @xmath13 . in the opposite case , @xmath41 , the propagator @xmath42 is expanded both in @xmath39 and @xmath13 while the propagator @xmath43 is left unexpanded .    for each diagram",
    ", we have to consider different momenta routings and identify all possible subgraphs . among them , there are two types of subgraphs that can be easily described .",
    "the first one corresponds to the situation when all lines in a diagram are off - shell by an amount of order @xmath27 . in this case",
    ", taylor expanding diagram in @xmath13 leads to a massless computation .",
    "the opposite situation occurs when both loop momenta are of order @xmath13 .",
    "then , a diagram is expanded in @xmath44 and the integrals we have to deal with are the two - loop massive vacuum integrals . in intermediate cases",
    "when some of the lines in a diagram are hard @xmath45 and other are soft @xmath46 , the two - loop graph factorizes into the product of one - loop graphs .    to compute the transversal and longitudinal functions separately , we choose different momenta of the soft photon .",
    "for example , if we choose the soft momentum @xmath14 in such a way that @xmath47 , we project out the longitudinal structure function . to get rid of free lorentz indices in that case , we contract the tensor @xmath48 , defined in eq.([eq2 ] ) , with @xmath49 .",
    "this procedure allows us to deal with scalar feynman two - loop integrals for the computation of @xmath50 . as we pointed out in the previous paragraph ,",
    "the calculation of these integrals is simple once the limits @xmath37 or @xmath51 are considered .",
    "a similar procedure is used to compute @xmath52 .",
    "we use dimensional regularization for the computation . for the consistent treatment of the axial current in @xmath53 dimensions ,",
    "we employ the procedure of ref.@xcite .",
    "the calculation is performed in an arbitrary covariant gauge ; the cancellation of the gauge parameter dependence in the final result is a welcome check on the correctness of the calculation . to present the results for the longitudinal and transversal functions , we define @xmath54 for @xmath34",
    ", we find @xmath55 where ellipses stands for higher order terms in the expansion in @xmath56 . in case @xmath35 ,",
    "the functions read @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the riemann zeta - function and ellipses stands for other terms suppressed by higher power of @xmath60 .",
    "several things can be pointed out in connection with these results . as expected , the qcd corrections to @xmath23 vanish in the limit @xmath38 , in accord with the non - renormalization theorems @xcite .",
    "also , the qcd corrections are not universal so that the all - orders perturbative relation @xmath61 is violated , once non - zero quark masses are allowed .    using eqs.([eq15],[eq6 ] ) , we can construct the entire functions @xmath62 with the help of pad approximation @xcite .",
    "to this end , we compute ten terms in the expansion of @xmath62 in @xmath56 and perform pad approximation replacing the series by rational functions .",
    "it turns out that the resulting functions do not depend on the precise form of the pad approximation employed for their construction . for computations described below we use the @xmath63 $ ] pad approximant .",
    "the virtue of the pad approximation is that it allows us to continue the small-@xmath27 expansion of the functions @xmath64 to large values of @xmath27 , where it should smoothly merge with the large-@xmath27 expansions of these functions eq.([eq6 ] ) .",
    "indeed , we observe a perfect match of the pad approximants and the large-@xmath65 expansion of the functions @xmath62 in the interval @xmath66 . hence , the pad approximants , supplemented with large-@xmath65 asymptotic , can be used to deduce @xmath64 for arbitrary values of @xmath56 .    for completeness , we present below the functions @xmath62 in the form of the @xmath63 $ ] pad approximants .",
    "we introduce @xmath67 and write @xmath68 the coefficients @xmath69 are given in tables  [ table1],[table2 ] .",
    "the functions @xmath62 are plotted in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "it is interesting that for large range of @xmath60 , the approximate relation @xmath70 holds with reasonable accuracy .",
    ".[table1 ] coefficients for the @xmath63 $ ] pad approximant for the longitudinal and transversal functions . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "as we pointed out in the introduction , the non - renormalization of the functions @xmath22 by perturbative qcd effects beyond the chiral limit , claimed in @xcite , is not possible to understand given the operator product expansion ( ope ) of the tensor @xmath19 derived in @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we elaborate on this statement .",
    "typically , the ope is employed to estimate non - perturbative corrections to , otherwise , nearly perturbative observables .",
    "this is achieved by separating physics at different distance or momentum scales .",
    "soft contributions , associated with non - perturbative effects , are characterized by momentum scale @xmath71 whereas hard contributions are characterized by external kinematic scale @xmath72 .",
    "when the ope is applied , soft components are identified with matrix elements of local operators while hard momenta contribute to wilson coefficients of these operators .",
    "although the ope is associated with computations beyond perturbation theory , its main idea , separation of physics at different distance scales , makes it suitable for _ perturbative _ computations if largely different scales are present .",
    "hence , it is well - suited for studying longitudinal and transversal functions in the limit @xmath35 . in this case ,",
    "soft scale is set by the mass of the quark @xmath13 rather than @xmath71 , but the ope remains intact .",
    "the ope of the longitudinal and transversal functions reads @xcite @xmath73 where the normalization scale @xmath74 is introduced to make the separation of hard and soft modes unambiguous . in eq.([eq.ope ] ) , the sum includes all local operators that contribute to the matrix element @xmath75 and behave as rank two pseudo - tensors under lorentz transformations .",
    "the matrix elements are parametrized by @xmath76 where the dependence on the normalization point is made explicit .    from our results in the previous section ,",
    "it follows that the relation @xmath5 is violated once @xmath77 contributions to these functions are computed .",
    "we would like to analyze this result from the ope perspective . according to @xcite",
    ", there are two operators that are required to compute quadratic mass correction to the massless limit of the transversal and longitudinal functions .",
    "the first one is the dimension - two operator , @xmath78 , where @xmath79 ; its matrix element between the vacuum and the soft photon is trivial and leads to @xmath80 .",
    "the second operator is the dimension - three operator @xmath81 .",
    "its leading order wilson coefficient reads @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the running quark mass @xmath84 . \\label{eq6.6}\\ ] ]    from the ope of the functions @xmath22 , eq.([eq.ope ] ) , it follows that , in order to compute these functions through @xmath85 , we require the wilson coefficient of the operator @xmath86 , the matrix element of the operator @xmath87 and the wilson coefficients @xmath88 through @xmath8 . to obtain those ingredients , two- and",
    "one - loop computations are needed .",
    "it turns out that all the matrix elements and wilson coefficients can be extracted from the results reported in the previous section .",
    "this happens because our calculation is based on computing contributions from different momenta regions separately .",
    "then , soft regions in the one- and two - loop cases are identified with the matrix element of the operator @xmath87 through @xmath8 .",
    "we have checked that identical results for this matrix element are obtained , independent of whether such identification is done in @xmath89 or @xmath90 .",
    "this independence is simple , yet welcome , check on the correctness of the calculation .",
    "the matrix element @xmath91 is divergent ( cf . fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "to arrive at the renormalized matrix element we use the @xmath92 renormalization scheme and the fact that , under renormalization , @xmath87 mixes with the operator @xmath93 .",
    "we obtain @xmath94 , \\label{eq.kappa } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 .    using eq.([eq.kappa ] ) , we determine wilson coefficients of the operators @xmath96 by matching the ope of the functions @xmath22 , eq.([eq.ope ] ) , to perturbative result eq.([eq6 ] ) . for simplicity , we give those wilson coefficients at the normalization scale @xmath97 , where they do not contain any logarithms . to present the results ,",
