    "charge transfer / transport properties in dna attract lively interest among physicists , chemists and engineers @xcite .",
    "it is now well established that diverse dna structural deformations are of extreme importance during the charge transfer / transport process , because they help to create polarons which promote not only the formation of a localized electronic state , but may also assist in rendering the latter mobile @xcite .",
    "remarkably , recent sophisticated experimental techniques , like , for example , spin - echo spectroscopy , allow to measure stochastic structural dynamics of monomers in polymer chains , such as double - stranded dna @xcite : there is a wealth of dynamical modes possessed of a quasi - continuum spectrum . in principle , each of these can influence dna charge transfer / transport , but , since there are more or less active modes @xcite , it is possible to take the whole manifold of dna molecular vibrations into two parts - those which are most active , plus a `` stochastic bath '' consisting of all other ones . for the present , a number of the polaron models have been proposed to describe charge transfer / transport in dna polymers , see , for example , @xcite . on the other hand , computer simulations have pinpointed the crucial significance of dynamical disorder for dna transfer / transport @xcite , and several attempts to formulate stochastical models for the interplay of the former and the latter have already appeared in the literature , see , for example , @xcite .    in this communication , we shall deal with the polaron - like model by hennig and coworkers as described in the works @xcite , where charge+breather propagation along dna homopolynucleotide duplexes , i.e. in the both poly(dg)-poly(dc ) and poly(da)-poly(dt ) dna polymers has been studied .",
    "these works find that the coupled motion of charges and breathers connected with localized structural vibrations may contribute to highly efficient long - range conductivity .    in our previous paper",
    ", we have investigated localization properties of electronic states in the adiabatic limit using a stochastic - bond - vibration approach for poly(dg)-poly(dc ) and poly(da)-poly(dt ) dna polymers within the framework of the polaron model @xcite .",
    "that time , we assumed that the disorder is caused by dna vibrational modes , and it influences the charge transfer / transport along dna duplexes via electron - vibrational coupling .",
    "here we present numerical results concerning the influence of stochastic changes in dna hydrogen - bond stretchings and double - helical twisting angles , as well as the effects of finite system size , on the electron localization properties .",
    "specifically , in the present paper we numerically investigate quantum diffusion of electron in the hennig model of poly(dg)-poly(dc ) and poly(da)-poly(dt ) with added fluctuations .",
    "the latter are described by a colored noise associated with stochastic dynamics of the distances @xmath0 between two watson - crick base pair partners : @xmath1 .",
    "these fluctuations can be regarded as a stochastic process at high temperature , with phonon modes being randomly excited . in the model",
    "the characteristic decay time @xmath2 of the correlation can control the spread of the electronic wavepacket .",
    "interestingly , the white - noise limit @xmath3 can in effect correspond to a sort of motional narrowing regime , ( see , for example , @xcite ) because we find that such a regime causes ballistic propagation of the wavepacket through homogeneous dna duplexes .",
    "still , in the adiabatic limit @xmath4 , dna electronic states should be strongly affected by localization .",
    "the amplitude @xmath5 of the random fluctuations within the base pairs ( the fluctuation of the distance between two bases in a base pair ) and the correlation time @xmath2 , are very critical parameters for the diffusive properties of wavepackets .",
    "the finding of ballistic behavior in the white - noise limit vs. localization in the adiabatic limit is interesting , since there is a number of experimental works @xcite observing ballistic conductance of dna in water solutions , which is also temperature - independent @xcite .",
    "et al . _ have tried to explain the latter effect , using a kind of acoustic phonon motions in dna duplexes @xcite , which seems to be plausible @xcite , but not the only possible physical reason .",
    "we will propose an alternative explanation for the observed temperature - independent conductance , based upon our numerical results .",
    "the outline of the present paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce our dna model for the investigation of its diffusive electronic properties . in sect .",
    "3 , we give a brief explanation for the characteristic motion of wavepackets under the impact of colored noise . in sec .",
    "4 we present numerical results concerning the influence of the hydrogen - bond stretching fluctuations and twist angles on the localization properties .",
    "furthermore we comment on the relation between our numerical result and the experimental one .",
    "the last section contains our conclusions .",
    "the hamiltonian for the electronic part in our dna model is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are creation and annihilation operators of an electron at the site @xmath9 .",
    "the on - site energies @xmath10 are represented as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a constant and @xmath13 denotes the structural fluctuation caused by the coupling with the transversal watson - crick h - bonding stretching vibration .",
    "the transfer integral @xmath14 depends on the three - dimensional distance @xmath15 between adjacent stacked base pairs , labeled by @xmath9 and @xmath16 , along each strand - and is expressed as follows , @xmath17 the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 describe the strength of the interaction between the electronic and vibrational variables .",
    "the 3d displacements @xmath15 bring about also a variation of the distances between neighboring bases along each strand .",
    "the first order taylor expansion around the equilibrium positions is given by @xmath20 @xmath21 represents the equilibrium radius of the helix , @xmath22 is the equilibrium double - helical twist angle between base pairs , and @xmath23 the equilibrium distance between bases along one strand given by @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the distance between neighboring base pairs in the direction of the helix axis . we adopt realistic values of the parameters obtained from the semi - empirical quantum - chemical calculations @xcite .",

    "in addition to the dna homopolymer duplexes , we also investigate the mixed sequence consisting of two types of the watson - crick pairs .",
    "then , as a zero - order approximation , the electron - phonon coupling parameters for the mixed gc / at stacks are taken here to be equal to the values obtained for poly(dg)-poly(dc ) and poly(da)-poly(dt ) dna polymers .",
    "we used mainly 4th order runge - kutta - gill method in the numerical simulation for the time evolution with time step @xmath54 .",
    "in some cases we confirmed the accuracy of the so obtained results by complete accord with the results gained with the help of a 6th order symplectic integrator that is higher order unitary integrations .",
    "the explicit time - dependence of the hamiltonian comes from the fluctuation of the variable @xmath55 at each site @xmath9 . to mimic these fluctuations we use a gaussian - markovian process with standard deviation @xmath56(amplitude ) and correlation time @xmath2 characterized by the following covariance @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "this process is called the ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "there is no spatial correlation , viz , the stochastic fluctuations at different sites are independent of each other .",

    "the adiabatic limit ( @xmath59 ) corresponds static anderson model .",
    "a numerical way for the generation of the colored noise is given in appendix a. the fluctuations are characterized by two parameters , i.e. amplitude @xmath56 and correlation time @xmath2 .",

    ", we may treat @xmath55 and @xmath66 as statistically independent quantities .",
    "this limiting case becomes valid when the lattice temperature is well above the debye temperature .",
    "the characteristic decay rate @xmath67 of the correlation function is on the order of the frequency @xmath68 of the slow bond vibrations due to the relation @xmath69   8 \\times 10^{12}[s^{-1 } ] } { 0.1[ev ] } \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the adiabatic limit holds true for @xmath70 allowing for the application of the born - oppenheimer approximation .    in general , in our numerical simulation ,",
    "the order of mean values @xmath71 and the amplitude of the fluctuations ( standard deviation ) @xmath72 of the on - site energy and the transfer energy are estimated as follows : @xmath73 , where @xmath74 . as the fluctuating amplitude",
    "is concerned it can be naturally incorporated by assuming the temperature dependence as , @xmath75 particularly , at room temperature , i.e. for @xmath76 $ ] , the value of the scaled dimensionless thermal energy is given by @xmath77 .",
    "the motion of the electron in the fluctuating medium is crucially influenced by the values of the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath2 .",
    "another important parameter is the band width @xmath78 of the electron system which is given by the static case without fluctuation @xmath79 . in the scaled hennig model for dna",
    "the band width is @xmath80 , although the exact value depends on a - t or g - c or mixed models . in order to infer on the onsequences of the noise for the elelctronmotion it illustratitive to express the parameters of the noise in units of @xmath56 .",
    "thus , with regard to its influence on the motion the noise is quantified by the effective parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 . while @xmath78 and @xmath83 have the effect of narrowing the absorption linewidth , @xmath56 has the oppsite effect , namely broadening of the linewidth .",
    "the motional narrowing of the resonant absorption linewidth becomes important when the fluctuation rate is larger than the amplitude , i.e. @xmath84 .",
    "it then follows that time - dependent perturbation theory is true for @xmath85 or @xmath86 , and the adiabatic approximation is applicable in the region @xmath87 . in the following sections we show some typical wavepacket dynamics in the different parameter regimes .",
    "note that the ballistic propagation of a wave packet occurs when @xmath88 , i.e. the fluctuation is very rapid and the system is reduced to a regular system without any disorder .",
    "in this section , we show the numerical results of the wavepacket dynamics .",
    "we consider quantum diffusion of an initially localized wavepacket @xmath89 .",
    "then we mainly monitor the time - dependence of the mean square displacement ( msd ) @xmath90 and the distribution function @xmath91 .",
    "we used @xmath92 and @xmath93 through this paper .",
    "first we present our numerical results of simple cases with a constant transfer integral @xmath95 for all @xmath9 .",
    "we illustrate the typical motion of a wavepacket in cases when only the on - site energy @xmath50 fluctuates according to a ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "although we used mixed model in this case the qualitative result does not depend on the type of model even if we adapt a - t model and g - c model .",

    "snap - shots of @xmath98 in a - t model for various correlation time @xmath96 are shown in figure 4 . as a result",
    "we obtain that the essential behavior does not depend on existence of the fluctuations of the hopping term .",
    "the dynamical behavior is qualitatively similar to the cases discussed in the preceding section with constant @xmath110 . in the relatively short - correlation case ( white - noise limit @xmath99 ) ,",
    "the wave packet exhibits ballistic propagation . the extent of the spread of the wavepacket in the a - t model is larger than that of the g - c model . on the other hand , in the adiabatic limit ( @xmath100 ) the wave packet localizes , which corresponds to anderson localization .",

    "fig.3(b ) ) for a smaller amplitude @xmath116 the quantum diffusion behaves ballistically ( @xmath117 ) within the same time scale .",
    "for the @xmath118 and the @xmath119 model we found similar behavior in dependence on the change in the fluctuation strength @xmath56 .",
    "[ h ]     and ( b ) @xmath120 at @xmath114 in the mixed model with @xmath121 . ]      here we investigate the temporal diffusion rate defined as @xmath122 in the almost diffusive range @xmath123 , where @xmath124 expresses the average over several samples . if the motion of the wave packet is diffusive the diffusion rate is supposed to attain a constant value .",
    "figure 6 shows the diffusion rate as a function of @xmath83 for various fluctuation amplitudes @xmath56 in a - t and g - c models . for the estimate of the diffusion rate we used a time interval @xmath125 . where the error of the diffusion rate is less than ten percent .",
    "@xmath126 approaches zero for adiabatic limit ( @xmath127 ) due to anderson localization , while @xmath126 goes to infinity for motional narrowing case ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "as indicated in sect.3 , increase of @xmath56 means increase of temperature .",
    "it follows that the diffusion rate in the a - t model is larger than that in g - c model at the relatively low temperature ( @xmath129 ) . however , at higher temperatures ( @xmath130 ) the two models exhibit virtually equal behavior in this correlation - time range .",

    "furthermore , it has been shown that @xmath133 is a better conductor than @xmath134 in the conducting experiments , just in accordance with the earlier experimental and theoretical findings @xcite .",
    "the work @xcite explained the observed temperature independence by deactivation of the acoustic modes of dna at room and higher temperatures .",
    "it is interesting to recall in this context an earlier work @xcite , where almost temperature independent photoinjected electron / hole mobility has been calculated on the basis of the stochastic haken - strobl - reinecker ( hsr ) model for discotic liquid crystals . unlike in our model",
    ", the hsr hamiltonian used in @xcite treats all the vibrational and lattice modes as a source of fluctuations of the parameters of the tight - binding model , without singling out any mode responsible for polaron formation . as a result ,",
    "the hsr mobility temperature independence shows up only at small fluctuations of the molecules around their equilibrium positions .",
    "this is not the case in our present model .",
    "we have to pay attention to relatively short - time behavior and/or small spread regime ( @xmath135 ) , as we compare the experimental result with our numerical results .",
    "figure 7 shows the msd in the a - t model with @xmath99 and @xmath136 respectively in which cases ballistic propagation is observed due to the motional narrowing . in the short - time regime",
    "the time dependence of the msd shows relatively weak @xmath137dependence once the motional narrowing has affected the diffusive behavior .",
    "therefore , the temperature - independence may be caused by the motional narrowing and the finite - size effect in the experiment .",
    "figure 8 shows the short - time behavior of the cases @xmath103 and @xmath99 depicted on a larger time scale in fig.3 .",
    "it follows that in the short - time behavior the @xmath138 case is more diffusive than its @xmath139 counterpart within the range fro which the spread of the wavepacket is @xmath135 .    [ h ]     in the a - t model with @xmath140 . ]",

    "the decay time of the correlation can control the spread of the electronic wavepacket .",
    "it has been shown that in a motional narrowing regime the averaging over fluctuations causes ballistic propagation of the wavepacket and in the adiabatic regime the electronic states are strongly localized .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the motional narrowing affects the localization in the poly(dg)-poly(dc ) and poly(da)-poly(dt ) dna polymers . in either model temperature - dependence",
    "becomes virtually suppressed when the motion of the wave packet is characterized by ballistic propagation .",
    "we have also investigated the temporal diffusion rate in the almost diffusive range .",
    "it has been found that the diffusion rate of the a - t model is larger than that of the g - c model at comparatively low temperatures .",
    "interestingly for relatively high temperatures in the diffusive range of the wavepacket motion the difference between the two dna systems gets smaller .",
    "furthermore we commented on the relation between our numerical results and the experimental ones .",
    "it was shown that in the short - time behavior the significant difference of the spread of wavepackets does not exist between @xmath134 and @xmath133 except for the localization cases .    in the present report we used periodic sequences , i.e. constant values of @xmath26 , @xmath28 , as static parts of the on - site and hopping terms for poly(dg)-poly(dc ) and poly(da)-poly(dt ) dna polymers , respectively .",
    "this also includes the mixed model .",
    "then the motional narrowing for dynamical disorder makes the time - evolution of the wavepacket ballistic .",
    "however , it should be remarked that motional narrowing strongly localizes the wavepacket if we use disordered sequence for the static parts of @xmath141 and/or @xmath14 .",
    "in this appendix , we give an algorithm in order to generate the gaussian colored noise @xmath142 at the @xmath143th time step @xcite .",
    "first , let us assume gaussian random numbers @xmath144 with zero mean and unit variance at the time @xmath145 .",

    "we used the algorithm independently for each site @xmath9 .",
    "it should be noted , that there is another algorithm using the power spectrum of the stochastic process , which is applicable to a lot of types of the correlated sequence @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that motional narrowing due to large thermal fluctuation effects the coherence of relaxation dynamics such as spin relaxation in semiconductors @xcite or vibrational dephasing in a spin - peierls system with lattice fluctuations @xcite .",
