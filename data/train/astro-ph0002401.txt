    "the magnification of a point image at position @xmath1 is given by @xmath13 .",
    "in general there are several curves in the image plane along which the magnification tensor is singular and the magnification is infinite ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "these are called `` critical curves , '' and they map to `` caustics '' in the source plane .",
    "caustics mark discontinuities in the number of images , which leads to the key idea for our analysis : in order to determine the number of images produced by a lens model , it is sufficient to examine the caustics .",
    "if we know that a source arbitrarily far from the lens produces only one image , then we can imagine moving the source around and noting when it crosses a caustic to keep track of the total number of images .",
    "we discuss examples in  3.2 .",
    "we model a galaxy as a singular isothermal ellipsoid , because this model is not only analytically tractable but also consistent with models of individual lenses , lens statistics , stellar dynamics , and x - ray galaxies ( e.g.  fabbiano 1989 ; maoz & rix 1993 ; kochanek 1995 , 1996 ; grogin & narayan 1996 ; rix et al .",
    "if we take the ellipsoid to be oblate with intrinsic axis ratio @xmath15 then its three - dimensional density distribution is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the gravitational constant , @xmath18 is the velocity dispersion and @xmath19 the eccentricity of the mass distribution , and @xmath20 are usual cylindrical coordinates . for lensing we need the projected mass distribution .",

    "\\label{eq : cusps}\\ ] ]    if our model galaxy were non - singular , the lens model would have a second critical curve and caustic . since it is singular",
    ", however , the second critical curve collapses to a point at the origin , and the corresponding caustic is considered to be a `` pseudo - caustic . ''",
    "the pseudo - caustic has the cartesian parametric form @xmath49 where again @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is the same as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : astr ] ) .",
    "note that the pseudo - caustic does not depend on the shear .",
    "figure 1 shows typical caustics and pseudo - caustics for galaxy+shear lens models , plotted using @xmath52 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : bsis ] ) as the natural length scale . in general",
    "the pseudo - caustic is smooth , while the true caustic has cusps that give it a diamond or astroid shape .",
    "as discussed in  2.1 , the caustics indicate where the number of images changes . a source outside both the caustic and the pseudo - caustic produces one image .",
    "when the source crosses to the inside of the pseudo - caustic it gains one additional image , which is faint , close to the galaxy center , and distorted radially relative to the galaxy ; the pseudo - caustic is sometimes labeled the `` radial caustic '' because of the nature of the distortions .",
    "when the source crosses to the inside of the astroid caustic it gains two more images , which are bright , close to the corresponding critical curve , and distorted tangentially relative to the galaxy ; hence this caustic is sometimes labeled the `` tangential caustic . ''",
    "the presence of the pseudo - caustic and the tangential caustic means that the number of images in these models is either one , two , or four depending on the location of the source .",
    "all of these features are generic to singular lens models that are not axisymmetric ( see schneider et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "the size and shape of the astroid caustic are determined by the net quadrupole moment of the lens model . when the galaxy and shear are aligned ( @xmath53 , e.g.  figure 1a ) , the individual quadrupoles from the galaxy ellipticity and the shear combine to produce a larger astroid caustic than produced by either one alone . in other words ,",
    "the area where sources produce 4-image lenses is larger .",
    "mild misalignment between the ellipticity and shear twists the caustic ( e.g.  figure 1b ) .",
    "as the shear becomes more misaligned ( e.g.  figure 1c ) , the quadupole from the shear partially cancels the quadrupole from the ellipticity ; this is why figure 1c has the smallest astroid caustic despite having the largest shear .",
    "we return to this point in the discussion (  5 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows that when the shear is nearly orthogonal to the ellipticity ( @xmath54 ) , it can nearly cancel the effects of the ellipticity to produce a caustic that is quite small .",
    "nevertheless , the caustic is very interesting because it shows qualitatively new features not seen in figure 1 .",
    "( similar examples can be found in witt & mao 2000 . ) the caustic folds over on itself in features called `` swallowtails '' ( see schneider et al .",
    "1992 ) . because the number of images increases by two when the source crosses the caustic , a source inside a swallowtail produces six images ( e.g.  figure 2b ) .",
    "the swallowtails are sensitive to the angle between the ellipticity and shear .",
    "they grow larger as the misalignment increases , until with near perfect misalignment the swallowtails overlap ( e.g.  figure 2c ) .",
    "the region of the source plane where swallowtails overlap corresponds to sources that produce eight images .",
    "in other words , the interaction of the ellipticity and shear makes it possible to have new image configurations with six or even eight images .",
    "not all combinations of ellipticity and shear can produce these new image configurations .",
    "figure 3 shows caustics for three cases where the shear is orthogonal to the ellipticity ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "if the shear is small ( figure 3a ) , the system is dominated by the ellipticity and any swallowtails that exist are small .",
    "if the shear is large ( figure 3c ) , the system is dominated by the shear and again any swallowtails are small . for a given ellipticity , only a narrow range of orthogonal shears can produce overlapping swallowtails ( figure 3b ) . in ",
    "3.3 we discuss in detail the range of models that can produce 6- and 8-image configurations .      appendices a and b give a mathematical analysis of the range of models that have swallowtails and thus can produce 6- or 8-image lenses ; we summarize the results here .",
    "we use the presence of swallowtails in the caustic to indicate that a model can produce more than four images .",
    "this approach does not directly indicate the probability of observing a lens with more than four images . estimating this probability requires detailed computations of lensing cross sections and magnification distributions for realistic sets of lens environments .",
    "we discuss these issues briefly in  5 and plan to study them in more detail in a forthcoming paper .",
    "for now we seek to delineate the conditions under which a lens can produce more than four images .",
    "figures 46 show the envelope of swallowtail models in the @xmath56 plane for different values of the shear angle @xmath36 .",
    "when the shear is orthogonal to the ellipticity ( figure 4 ) , the envelope encloses small shears for modestly flattened galaxies ( @xmath57 ) and larger shears for more flattened galaxies ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "swallowtails can exist for @xmath35 arbitrarily small and @xmath23 arbitrarily close to unity ( ellipticity arbitrarily small ) , provided that the shear and ellipticity are in the narrow band where they properly balance each other .",
    "a relatively broad band of the swallowtail models also have overlapping swallowtails and thus can produce 8-image lenses .",
    "if @xmath36 changes by even a few degrees away from perfect misalignment , however , the envelope pinches off at the high-@xmath23/low-@xmath35 end ( figure 5 ) .",
    "in other words , obtaining swallowtails requires more ellipticity and shear .",
    "also , the range of models with overlapping swallowtails quickly disappears ( not shown ) . from these results",
    "we conclude that 6- and 8-image lenses produced by small tidal perturbations ( e.g.  @xmath59 ) are likely to be very rare because they require a special combination of galaxy axis ratio and shear misalignment angle .",
    "however , with stronger perturbations the range of swallowtail models is considerably larger .",
    "thus we predict that even though 6- or 8-image lenses may still be rare , they are more likely to occur when the perturbation is strong ( such as a second galaxy near the primary lens galaxy ) than when the perturbation is weak . since strong perturbations may not be well approximated by the external shear model , in  4.2 we study models using a full treatment of a perturbation from a nearby galaxy or group .",
    "the mathematical analysis does reveal that swallowtails can exist for smaller shear misalignments ; while the results are formally interesting , they are physically implausible because they require highly flattened galaxies and very large shears ( figure 6 ) . for @xmath60 , there are two envelopes that are comparable in size . for @xmath61 ( @xmath62 , see eq .",
    "[ eq : a6 ] ) , one of the envelopes stretches to arbitrarily large shears . for @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) ,",
    "the finite envelope disappears but the infinite one remains .",
    "this envelope finally disappears for @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) . with the strong perturbations required by these envelopes",
    ", however , the simple shear approximation almost certainly breaks down .",
    "thus this analysis is probably not fully valid , but it does suggest features to look for when studying models with very strong perturbations , such as interacting galaxies .",
    "although we have studied singular lens models for analytic convenience , real galaxies may have a small but finite core radius .",
    "it is important to understand whether swallowtails are robust under the addition of a core radius . adding a core radius adds one faint image near the center of the galaxy for any configuration with more than one image , so the total number of images is always odd ( see schneider et al .",
    "figure 7 shows generalizations of the caustics in figures 2b and 2c to a finite core radius @xmath67 , using the lensing properties of a softened isothermal ellipsoid given by keeton & kochanek ( 1998 ) .",
    "the swallowtails shrink as @xmath67 increases  probably because when we increase @xmath67 with @xmath52 held fixed , we decrease the galaxy mass and hence reduce the contribution of the ellipticity to the potential . however ,",
    "no convincing case of a faint central image has been observed , and this limits the core radius ( @xmath68 , see wallington & narayan 1993 ; kochanek 1996 ) and suggests that lens galaxies are quite cuspy .",
    "the presence of such small cores would not significantly affect our results .      as discussed in  3.3",
    ", the galaxy+shear models suggest that the perturbation must be relatively strong in order to produce swallowtails . for such strong perturbations ,",
    "the external shear approximation may not be justified , so in this section we examine a simple model in which the perturbation is produced by a second mass distribution representing a neighboring galaxy or group .",
    "we again use a singular isothermal mass distribution for the perturber , but for simplicity we assume it is spherical .    the perturber is described by three physical parameters : its velocity dispersion @xmath69 ( or equivalently its critical radius @xmath70 given by eq .",
    "[ eq : bsis ] ) , of the main lens galaxy as the natural scale length . ] and its position relative to the lens galaxy , given by the projected distance @xmath71 from the galaxy center and the angle @xmath36 from the lens galaxy s major axis . to generalize the galaxy+shear models , it is convenient to characterize the perturber not by its velocity dispersion @xmath69 but rather by the strength of the perturbation .",
    "to lowest order , the perturbation is equivalent to an external shear with strength @xmath72 it is important to understand what this strength means . all perturbers with a given strength @xmath35 are equivalent to each other and to an external shear of strength @xmath35  _ to second order in the potential_. the differences enter only in terms of third order and higher .",
    "nevertheless , we show here that the differences are important .",
    "we note that since the perturbation strength @xmath35 is a combination of the velocity dispersion and distance , perturbers with a given strength but different distances must have different velocity dispersions , @xmath73 in other words , the more distant the perturber is , the more massive it has to be , and vice versa .",
    "the top panels in figure 8 show the caustics for a galaxy+shear model with @xmath74 and @xmath55 .",
    "they are similar to figure 3 but include more values of @xmath35 .",
    "the other panels in figure 8 show the generalization to two - galaxy models , using the same values of @xmath35 and distances @xmath75 .",
    "note that the galaxy+shear models in the top panel are equivalent to two - galaxy models with @xmath76 .",
    "figure 9 is similar , but shows the caustic structures for @xmath77 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigrat ] ) , the models in figures 8 and 9 have perturbers that range in mass from the scale of a galaxy to that of a cluster .",
    "the examples show two important effects .",
    "first , the swallowtails tend to be _ larger _ in two - galaxy models than in equivalent galaxy+shear models , and they grow as the distance @xmath71 decreases .",
    "the various models differ only in higher order terms , but those terms apparently strengthen the perturber s effects .",
    "equivalently , the range of models that produce swallowtails is larger .",
    "second , in galaxy+shear models the symmetry of the shear implies that there are always two identical swallowtails .",
    "by contrast , in two - galaxy models one of the swallowtails is often quite large , while the other is either small or absent . as a result , the area in the source plane where swallowtails overlap is small or absent , so the models have a limited ability to produce 8-image lenses .",
    "we conclude from these examples that the qualitative features we saw in the galaxy+shear models are stable when we change the source of the perturbation .",
    "in fact , the range of swallowtail models seems to _ increase _ with more realistic treatments of strong or close perturbations .",
    "however , it appears that the overlapping swallowtails required to produce octuple lenses are rare and not very stable .",
    "we have studied the lensing properties of an isothermal elliptical density galaxy in the presence of a tidal perturbation to classify the caustic structures and identify different image configurations . in most cases",
    "the models have a simple caustic structure corresponding to standard 2-image and 4-image lens configurations . however ,",
    "when the tidal shear has a magnitude and direction appropriate to partially cancel the effects of the galaxy s ellipticity , the caustics develop complicated swallowtail features that correspond to 6- and 8-image configurations that have not yet been observed .",
    "we gave a complete analytic treatment of the case of a singular galaxy with a perturbation modeled as an external shear , but we showed that the caustic structures are stable when one adds a small core radius or uses a more realistic treatment of the perturbation .",
    "in fact , the swallowtail caustic structures are generally bigger with the more realistic perturbation than with the shear approximation , which may enhance the likelihood of observing lenses with more than four images .",
    "our analysis has several observational consequences .",
    "first , sextuple and octuple lenses are likely to be rare because they require special lens configurations .",
    "in fact , they will probably be found only when there is a second galaxy close enough to the lens galaxy to provide a strong perturbation . while this situation is uncommon ,",
    "it is not exceedingly rare : at least five lenses appear to have multiple lens galaxies within the einstein radius .",
    "still , to quantify the likelihood of finding a sextuple or octuple lens , it is necessary to compute the lensing cross sections for various combinations of the galaxy axis ratio @xmath23 and the shear amplitude @xmath35 and misalignment angle @xmath36 .",
    "figure 10 shows cross sections for @xmath74 , @xmath78 , and three values of @xmath36 that correspond to the cases shown in figure 2 .",
    "the configurations with more images have smaller cross sections and thus smaller probabilities for being observed . however they also have significantly higher magnifications , which means that magnification bias will be important ( e.g.  turner 1980 ; turner , ostriker & gott 1984 ) .",
    "magnification bias will mitigate the effects of small cross sections to increase the likelihood of observing a sextuple or octuple lens . clearly",
    "a realistic prediction of the lensing probabilities will require computation of cross sections and magnification bias for many combinations of @xmath79 weighted by realistic populations of lens galaxies and perturbers .",
    "we plan to address these issues of observability in a forthcoming paper , both in the context of current surveys and of the next generation space telescope , where large numbers of lenses are expected ( e.g.  barkana & loeb 1999 ) .",
    "second , if discovered the sextuple and octuple lenses that we have described will be easy to identify because the lensed images lie approximately on a circle ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "any lens with more than four images that do not trace a circle must not be of the type described here .",
    "indeed , in b  1933 + 503 there are ten images not on a circle , and it is thought that they must be associated with three different sources ( sykes et al .",
    "1998 ) . in b  1359",
    "+ 154 there are six radio sources with four sources in a standard quadruple lens configuration , plus two sources inside the configuration whose interpretation is not clear ( myers et al .",
    "although observations and models suggest that there may be multiple lens galaxies ( rusin et al .",
    "1999 ) , the fact that the six sources do not follow a circle suggests that lens can not be explained by swallowtails produced by the lens galaxies .",
    "third , observed sextuple or octuple lenses would be very useful for constraining models of the lensing mass distribution .",
    "the `` extra '' images beyond the standard two or four would provide additional position and flux constraints .",
    "even better , the sensitivity of the caustic structures to the lens galaxy ellipticity and the shear amplitude and misalignment angle means that the mere existence of six or more images should place strong constraints on those properties of the model . as a result",
    ", a sextuple or octuple lens could represent a wonderful ability to break the common degeneracy between the lens galaxy shape and the shear from the surrounding environment ( see keeton et al .",
    ". such a lens might even serve as the long - sought `` golden lens '' for measuring the hubble constant @xmath80 ( see schechter 2000 ) provided that a time delay could be measured , although the time delay might be relatively short ( a few days ) because the images are all close to the critical curve .",
    "these applications are predicated on the ability to resolve the individual images , and this ability might be limited when we include the effects of finite source size .",
    "figure 11 shows that the source does not have to be very large before the images smear into a partial or complete einstein ring .",
    "this happens for @xmath81 , where typically @xmath82@xmath33 for galaxy - scale lenses .",
    "radio surveys can achieve sub - milli - arcsecond resolution with vlbi or vlba mapping ( e.g.  the class survey , see browne 2000 and references therein ) , so they should still be able to resolve individual images and thus find lenses amenable to these applications . by contrast , optical surveys ( such as the sloan digital sky survey , see gunn et al.1998 and fischer et al .  1999 , or the next generation space telescope ,",
    "see barkana & loeb 1999 ) are more likely find partial or complete einstein rings .",
    "still , new techniques for modeling einstein rings show that they are very useful for constraining not only the lens model but also the intrinsic shape of the source ( keeton , kochanek & mcleod 2000b ) .",
    "finally , our study may be relevant for the so - called ellipticity `` crisis , '' where lens galaxies are inferred to have larger ellipticities than the observed early - type galaxies ( see kochanek 1996 and references therein ) . from figure 1 , it is clear that the caustic structures are the largest when the shear is aligned with the major axis of the lensing galaxy so the ellipticity and shear act coherently ; conversely , the caustic structures are the smallest when the shear is orthogonal to the major axis since the shear partially cancels the lens ellipticity .",
    "observationally , this means that for a sample of quadruple lenses the shear may preferentially lie along the galaxy major axis ; a good example is b  1422 + 231 ( hogg & blandford 1994 ) . the presence of an aligned shear is difficult to infer from lens models due to a degeneracy in the lens equation ( see witt 1996 ) : naive lens models simply imply a model ellipticity equivalent to the combination of the true ellipticity and the shear .",
    "this effect may generate a bias toward larger inferred ellipticities for lens galaxies , although a full account of this bias awaits further investigations .",
    "we thank peter schneider for helpful discussions , and the anonymous referee for prompt and helpful comments that improved the discussion .",
    "in this appendix we compute the range of galaxy+shear models ( see  3 ) that can produce at least six images . because the caustics determine the image number , finding models that can yield at least six images is equivalent to finding models in which the caustic has swallowtails .",
    "we saw in  3.2 that in models without swallowtails the caustic has four cusps , while in models with swallowtails the caustic has more than four cusps .",
    "thus to identify models with swallowtails it is sufficient to find models that have more than the standard four solutions to the cusp equation ( [ eq : cusps ] ) .    in other words , the envelope bounding the region in parameter space where",
    "models have swallowtails is located where the cusp equation develops additional pairs of solutions . if the cusp equation ( [ eq : cusps ] ) is written as @xmath83 , the place where additional solutions appear is defined by @xmath84 these equations yield two polynomials in @xmath85 and @xmath86 , so we can use the resultant method ( e.g.  walker 1955 ; erdl & schneider 1993 ) to eliminate @xmath43 .",
    "we find that the envelope is given by roots of the equation @xmath87 where the coefficients @xmath88 are : @xmath89 \\nonumber\\\\ a_4 & = & 16{c_{\\gamma}}^4(1-q^2)^2 ( 1 + 34q^2+q^4 )          + 2{c_{\\gamma}}^2(7 + 58q^2 + 7q^4)(43 + 22q^2 + 43q^4 )                           \\nonumber\\\\      & & -3(1 + 380q^2 - 2058q^4 + 380q^6+q^8 )                                 \\nonumber\\\\ a_5 & = & 6{c_{\\gamma}}(1+q^2 ) \\bigl [ 4{c_{\\gamma}}^2(1-q^2)^2(19 + 358q^2 + 19q^4 )          -1 - 500q^2 + 4890q^4 - 500q^6-q^8 \\bigr ]                             \\nonumber\\\\ a_6 & = & 128{c_{\\gamma}}^4(1-q^2)^4(1 + 34q^2+q^4 )          - 3{c_{\\gamma}}^2(1-q^2)^2(1 + 644q^2 - 6906q^4 + 644q^6+q^8 )                  \\nonumber\\\\      & & + 36 q^2(1 + 34q^2+q^4)^2 \\label{eq : a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath90 .",
    "for any set of parameters @xmath91 , @xmath92 means that the caustic does not have swallowtails , while @xmath93 means that the caustic does have swallowtails .",
    "thus each pair of solutions to @xmath94 gives an envelope bounding a region in parameter space in which swallowtails occur .",
    "for @xmath95 and @xmath96 we have @xmath97 and @xmath98 and the envelope equation simplifies to @xmath99 ^ 3\\ ,                  \\bigl [ 1-q^2\\pm{\\gamma}(1 + 5q^2 ) \\bigr]^3 = 0\\,.\\ ] ] with @xmath97 there are no solutions , and hence no models with swallowtails . with @xmath100",
    "the envelope of swallowtail models is @xmath101    more generally , for given values of @xmath36 and @xmath23 the envelope equation ( [ eq : f ] ) is a 6th order polynomial in @xmath35 whose roots are easy to find numerically . before using a root finder ,",
    "however , we should understand how many roots to expect and what their general ranges are .",
    "this requires that we examine how the polynomial @xmath102 depends on location in the @xmath103 plane .",
    "first consider how the number of roots changes as @xmath23 varies .",
    "additional pairs of roots appear when @xmath94 and @xmath104 , which can be combined using the resultant method to eliminate @xmath35 and obtain the condition @xmath105 { c_{\\gamma}}^2 \\quad = \\quad 0 ,    \\label{eq : g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where again @xmath106 .",
    "this is a second order polynomial in @xmath107 , so its solution is @xmath108\\ .",
    "\\label{eq : qroots}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( the second solution of the quadratic equation is unphysical because it has @xmath109 . ) the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qroots ] ) is between 0 and 1 for all @xmath110 , so there is always a physical solution ; in fact , there are two solutions , one for @xmath111 and one for @xmath112 .",
    "the two solutions intersect when @xmath113 , which occurs at @xmath114 .",
    "next , consider the behavior of the polynomial @xmath102 for large @xmath35 , which is controlled by the coefficient @xmath115 . if @xmath116 then @xmath92 for large @xmath35 , so there are no swallowtails for large @xmath35 . however , if @xmath117 then @xmath93 for large @xmath35 , so there are swallowtails for arbitrarily large @xmath35",
    ". thus the behavior of the polynomial changes qualitatively when @xmath115 changes sign . since @xmath115 is a quadratic polynomial in @xmath107 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : a ] ) , it is easy to find that @xmath118 if @xmath119\\ .",
    "\\label{eq : a6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the right - hand side is real for @xmath120 , and at this point it has @xmath121 or @xmath122 and @xmath123 .    with these results we can understand the @xmath103 plane as shown in figure 12 .",
    "the curves given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : qroots ] ) and ( [ eq : a6 ] ) define nine different regions where the swallowtail envelopes ( the parameter regions with @xmath93 ) have the following properties : @xmath124 negative shear is unphysical ( see  2.2 ) , so we are interested only in envelopes with @xmath39 , which occur in six of the nine regions : @xmath125 ; @xmath126 ; @xmath127 ; @xmath128 ; @xmath129 ; and @xmath130 .    with this detailed knowledge of the @xmath103 plane , we can use a numerical root finder with eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) to obtain the envelope of swallowtail models .",
    "the results are shown and discussed in  3.3 .",
    "in particular , figures 46 show envelopes in the @xmath56 plane for different values of @xmath36 .",
    "each envelope corresponds to a particular horizontal line in figure 11 .",
    "each point where this line crosses a curve in the @xmath103 plane corresponds to a cusp in the envelope in the @xmath56 plane .",
    "we can also ask what range of swallowtail models produce overlapping swallowtails that bound 8-image regions ( e.g.  figure 3b ) . we can not answer this question analytically for arbitrary values of the shear angle @xmath36 .",
    "however , from the examples in  3.2 we expect that overlapping swallowtails occur only when the shear is nearly orthogonal to the galaxy , and the case with @xmath55 can be studied analytically .",
    "when @xmath55 the system has reflection symmetry , so the points on the caustic with @xmath131 and @xmath132 are always cusps , no matter how convoluted the rest of the curve is .",
    "( these cusps are indicated in figure 3 . )",
    "moreover , the @xmath131 cusp always opens to the left , and the @xmath132 cusp always opens downward .",
    "label the @xmath131 cusp position @xmath133 and the @xmath132 cusp position @xmath134 ( h for horizontal , v for vertical ) . from figure 3",
    "we see that there are overlapping swallowtails only if @xmath135 and @xmath136 are both positive .",
    "( if one is positive and one negative then there are swallowtails that do not overlap . )",
    "we can use eq .",
    "( [ eq : astr ] ) to rewrite the conditions @xmath137 as follows : @xmath138 we can similarly rewrite the condition @xmath139 : @xmath140 for any galaxy axis ratio @xmath110 , these functions satisfy @xmath141 .",
    "thus the condition for overlapping swallowtails is @xmath142 , and this result is shown in figure 4 .",
