    "performance of a parallel computing system heavily depends on the effectiveness of the underlying interconnection network .",
    "an interconnection network is usually represented by a graph , where nodes and edges correspond to processors and communication links between processors , respectively . in the design and analysis of an interconnection network , one major concern is its graph embedding capability , which reflects how efficiently a parallel algorithm with structured task graph ( guest graph ) can be executed on this network ( host graph ) .",
    "cycles and paths are recognized as important guest graphs because a great number of parallel algorithms , such as matrix - vector multiplication , gaussian elimination and bitonic sorting , have been developed on cycle / path - structured task graphs @xcite .    as the size of a parallel computing system increases ,",
    "it becomes much likely that some processors and communication links fail to work in such a system .",
    "consequently , it is essential to study the fault - tolerant graph embedding capability of an interconnection network with faulty elements .    the _ hypercube - like networks _ ( hlns ) are an important class of generalizations of the popular hypercube interconnection networks for parallel computing . among hlns",
    "one may identify a subclass of networks , called the _ twisted hypercube - like networks _",
    "( thlns ) , which include most well - known variants of the hypercubes , such as crossed cubes @xcite , mbius cubes @xcite , twisted cubes @xcite and locally twisted cubes @xcite .",
    "the fault - free and fault - tolerant cycle / path embedding capabilities of these hypercube variants have been intensively studied in the literature @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", the fault - tolerant cycle / path embedding capabilities of hlns and thlns have received considerable research attention @xcite . however ,",
    "most of the embeddings tolerate no more faulty elements than the degree of the graph , i.e. , under the _ small fault model_. recently , yang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the cycle embedding capability of thlns with more faulty elements than the degree of the graph , i.e. , under the _ large fault model_. they proved that for an @xmath1-dimensional ( @xmath1-d ) thln @xmath0 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 contains a hamiltonian cycle if @xmath13 , and @xmath12 contains a near - hamiltonian cycle if @xmath14 .    a question arises naturally : what about the fault - tolerant hamiltonian paths in thlns under the large fault model ?",

    "it is well known that many classical parallel algorithms possess a linear array structured task graph . in order to implement a linear array structured parallel algorithm efficiently on a specific parallel computing system , it is essential to map the tasks owned by the parallel algorithm to the nodes of the underlying interconnection network so that any two tasks that are adjacent in the linear array are mapped to two adjacent nodes of the network .",
