    "tsunamis are water waves with long wavelengths that can be triggered by submarine earthquakes , landslides , volcanic eruption and large asteroid impacts .",
    "these non - dispersive waves can travel for thousands of kilometers from the disturbance area where they have been created with a minimum loss of energy . as any wave",
    ", tsunamis can be reflected , transmitted , refracted and diffracted .",
    "the physics of a tsunami can be very complex , especially if we consider its creation and behavior next to the beach , where it can break .",
    "however , since tsunamis are composed of waves with very large wavelengths , sometimes greater than 100 km , they can be considered as shallow waves , even in oceans with depths of a few kilometers .",
    "the shallow water approximation simplifies considerably the problem and still allows us to understand a lot of the physics of a tsunami . using such approximation , margaritondo @xcite deduced the dispersion relation of tsunami waves extending a model developed by behroozi and podolefsky @xcite . since energy losses due to viscosity and friction at the bottom @xcite can be neglected in the case of shallow waves , margaritondo , considering energy conservation , explained the increase of the wave height when a tsunami approaches the coast , where the depth of the sea and the wave velocity are both reduced .    in this paper",
    "we use one of the results of ref .",
    "@xcite in order to deduce the wave equation and include the variation of the seabed .",
    "thus , we are able to explain the increase of the wave amplitude when passing from deeper to shallow water . also , we discuss the refraction of tsunami waves . this phenomenon allowed the tsunami of december 24 , 2004 , created at the bay of bengal , to hit the west coast of india ( a detailed description is given in @xcite ) .",
    "these both inclusions - the seabed topography and the wave refraction - where pointed out by chu @xcite as necessary to understand some other phenomena observed in tsunamis .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the wave equation and the water flux conservation are used in section 2 in order to explain how and how much a shallow wave increases when passing from a deeper to a shallow water . in section 3 ,",
    "we extend the results obtained in section 2 to study how a wave packet propagates in a water tank where the depth varies ; in this section we use some numerical procedures that can be extended to the study of any wave propagating in a non - homogeneous medium .",
    "also , the refraction of the 2004 tsunami in the south on india is discussed in section 3 .",
    "the shallow wave and the continuity equations are deduced in appendix a.",
    "consider a perturbation on the water surface in a rectangular tank with a constant depth . in the limit of large wavelengths and a small amplitude compared with the depth of the tank",
    ", the wave equation can be simplified to ( see appendix a ) @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the vertical displacement of the water surface at a time @xmath2 , propagating in the @xmath3 direction , @xmath4 is the gravity acceleration and @xmath5 is the water depth .    equation ( [ wave ] ) is the most common one - dimensional wave equation .",
    "it is a second - order linear partial differential equation and , since @xmath4 and @xmath5 are constants , any function @xmath6 is a solution ( @xmath7 is the wave velocity ) .",
    "an interesting aspect of eq .",
    "( [ wave ] ) is that a propagating pulse does not present a dispersion due to the same velocity of all wavelengths and , thus , preserves its shape .",
    "light in vacuum ( and , in a very good approximation , in air ) is non - dispersive .",
    "also , sound waves in the air are nearly non - dispersive .",
    "( if dispersion was important in the propagation of the sound in the air , a sound would be heard different in different positions , i.e. , music and conversation would be impossible )    however , the velocity of shallow - water wave varies with the depth .",
    "thus , shallow - water waves are dispersive in a non - uniform seadepth .    in order to study the evolution of a tsunami in a rectangular box with variable depth ,",
    "which will be detailed in the next section , we approximate the irregular depth by successive steps .",
    "so , in the next paragraphs we will explain the treatment used when a wave encounters a discontinuity .",
    "every time the tsunami encounters a step , part is transmitted and part is reflected .",
    "then , consider a wave with an amplitude given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are , respectively , the wave number and the frequency incoming in a region where the depth of the water , and also the wave velocity , have a discontinuity as represented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    on the left - side of the discontinuity",
    "the perturbation is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 corresponds to the reflected wave and @xmath13 is a phase to be determined by the boundary conditions . on the right - side of the discontinuity",
    "the wave amplitude is given by @xmath14 corresponding to the transmitted wave part .",
    "the wave numbers for @xmath15 and @xmath16 are , respectively , @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the velocities of the wavepacket at the left and right sides of the discontinuity .    in order to determine @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    "we must impose the boundary conditions at @xmath23 . for any instant ,",
    "the wave should be continuous at @xmath23 : @xmath24 .",
    "the same should happen with the flux , @xmath25 , given by ( see eq .",
    "( [ flux1 ] ) ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the horizontal displacement of a transversal section of water ( see equation ( [ mcons ] ) for the relation between @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) .    imposing the boundary conditions @xmath30 and @xmath31 we can deduce @xmath32 . then choosing @xmath33 we obtain @xmath34 and @xmath35    it is worthwhile to mention here that other choices of @xmath13 and @xmath36 will change the signs of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "however , in this case , it will also change the phases of the reflected and transmitted waves .",
    "both modifications will compensate themselves and the shape of the wave will remain unchanged in relation of the choice @xmath33 .",
    "reflection and transmission are very important effects in wave propagation : every time a traveling wave ( light , water waves , pulses in strings , etc . ) encounters a discontinuity in the medium where it propagates , reflection and transmission occur . since there is no energy losses ,",
    "energy flux is conserved .",
    "the energy of a wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude @xcite .",
    "thus , the energy flux is proportional to the squared amplitude times the wave velocity .",
    "the energy flux of the incident wave at @xmath23 is given by @xmath37 ( the amplitude of the incident wave was chosen as 1 ) .    the reflected and transmitted energy flux are given by @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ r ] ) and ( [ t ] ) it is immediate to show that @xmath40 it is worthwhile to mention here that eqs .",
    "( [ r ] ) , ( [ t ] ) and ( [ angrel ] ) are classical textbook results on wave at interfaces .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the evolution of a wavepacket in three distinct situations : before find a step , passing the step and after passing the step . on the left side of @xmath23",
    "the depth is 2000 m and on the right side 10 m. we can note a growth of the wavepacket amplitude after passing a step due to the velocity variation , in this case @xmath41 , and , then @xmath42 .    using energy conservation ,",
    "margaritondo deduced that the wave amplitude , when going from a sea depth @xmath43 to @xmath44 , increases by the factor @xmath45 @xcite . according to this result",
    ", the amplitude in our example should grow by a factor of 3.8 . however , the growth observed was 1.9 .",
    "the difference is due to the fact that when a wave packet encounters a discrete step of velocity , part of the energy is reflected ( the reader can verify that eq .",
    "( [ angrel ] ) is satisfied ) . as will be shown in the next section , when the sea depth varies smoothly",
    ", the reflected wave can be neglected , and our results becomes equal to margaritondo s result .",
    "in order to study the evolution of a tsunami when it propagates in a rectangular box where the depth varies , we initially made a wavepacket propagating into a crescent @xmath3 direction .",
    "the variable depth was approximated by a succession of steps taken as narrow as we wish .",
    "the evolution of the wave packet was calculated as follows :    * at time @xmath2 , the wave packet amplitude @xmath1 was divided in @xmath46 small discrete transversal sections of length @xmath47 ( in our case @xmath47 = 50000 m ) . *",
    "every small part of the wave packet @xmath1 was investigated : ( i ) if in a time interval @xmath48 it stays in the same velocity step , then the wave packet at @xmath49 was simply increased by @xmath1 at the position @xmath50 .",
    "( ii ) if in a time interval @xmath48 , we choose @xmath48 as 30 s , it encounters a velocity step , part is reflected and part is transmitted . the reflected and transmitted parts were calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ r ] ) and ( [ t ] ) and added to the wave packet at @xmath49 propagating to the left or to the right , respectively .",
    "the step width and the time interval @xmath48 were chosen such that never the reflected or transmitted parts encounter a second step .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows three positions of the right - propagating wavepacket ( the left - propagating was omitted ) .",
    "the initial wavepacket , fig .",
    "2a , has its center at a depth of about 3930 m ( @xmath51 m / s ) , then the center of the wavepacket goes to a position where the depth is about 165 m ( @xmath52 m / s ) , fig .",
    "2c . the growth of the amplitude is about 1.7 .",
    "the difference between our result and the one expected by ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath53 ) is due to the fact that we approximate the continuous depth variation by discretes steps and , as a consequence , the left - propagating wavepacket was not negligible .    in the last paragraphs of this section we insert a short discussion of the refraction phenomenon .",
    "consider , for instance , a water wave propagating in a medium where the sea depth varies with @xmath54 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ seadepth ] ( for instance @xmath54 can be the distance from the coast ) .",
    "the wave crest at @xmath55 has a velocity @xmath56 and at @xmath57 velocity @xmath58 .",
    "it is a matter of geometry to show that a wavefront will change orientation as making a curve with radius @xmath59    for instance , consider what happened in south of india .",
    "the seadepth varies from about 2000 m at @xmath60500 km far from the coast to about 100 m near the coast , @xmath61 .",
    "thus , @xmath62 s@xmath63 . as a consequence ,",
    "the radius formed by a wave crest varies from about 640 km far from the coast to about 140 km near the coast .",
    "this is about what we can see from fig .",
    "4 . in fig .",
    "[ seadepth ] , a tsunami wavefront propagation , part in deep water and part in shallow water near the coast , will refract and , in consequence , change orientation . fig .",
    "[ refraction ] shows a refraction map for the december 26 , 2005 tsunami .",
    "the dashed curves are the frontwaves at 100 , 150 , 200 and 300 minutes after the earthquake @xcite .",
    "the tsunami of 26 december 2004 , obviously , did not propagate in a rectangular box , but , approximately , in a circular tank . as the tsunami propagates , its extension increases and , in consequence , its amplitude diminishes .",
    "however , when it approaches shallow waters , near to the coast , its amplitude grew up again as shown by the simplified model developed in this paper .",
    "the developed model depends on two approximations : the wave amplitude is small and the length of the wavepacket is large when compared with the sea depth . since the first approximation is not valid near the beach , we stopped the evolution when the front part of the tsunami wavepacket attained a depth of about 50 m , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c .    in summary , with the model developed in this paper",
    "we showed how to use the approximation of shallow water waves to a variable depth .",
    "this simple model allows us to understand what occurs when a tsunami goes from deeper to shallow waters : the velocity of the rear part of the wavepacket is larger than the velocity of its front part , causing water to pile up .",
    "also , refraction effects , that are not present in a sea of constant depth , can be observed near to the coast .",
    "mty thanks the brazilian agency fapesp ( fundao de amparo a pesquisa do estado de so paulo ) for financial support .",
    "we will deduce the wave equation in a simplified situation .",
    "we will make the following approximations ( all of them can be applied to tsunamis located far from the beach ) : the part of the restoration force that depends on the surface tension can be neglected in the case of waves with large wavelengths ; the wavelength or the extension of the wavepacket will be considered much longer than the depth of the water ( in the case of tsunamis the wavelengths and the ocean depth can have , approximately , hundreds of km and a few km , respectively ) ; the wave amplitude will be considered much smaller than the ocean depth .",
    "another simplification is the tank where the wave propagates : we will consider a wave propagating in a rectangular box with vertical walls and constant depth . in this approximation of shallow water waves , all the droplets in the same transversal portion",
    "have the same oscillatory horizontal motion along the @xmath3 direction . finally , friction at the bottom will be neglected  @xcite .",
    "[ fig1a ] illustrates the situation considered .",
    "the wave direction of propagation is @xmath3 ; @xmath64 is the unperturbed height of the water ; @xmath65 is the box width .",
    "[ fig1b ] shows the same box of fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] in a side - view showing a perturbation in the water . a lamellar slice with width @xmath47 in @xmath3 and a height @xmath5 at a time @xmath2 , will have a height @xmath66 and a width @xmath67 when it occupies the position @xmath68 at an instant @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath69 is the horizontal displacement - along the @xmath3 direction - of a vertical lamellar slice with an equilibrium position at @xmath3 .",
    "when the wave propagates , this part of the water oscillates to left and right . equaling the volume of water in @xmath47 and @xmath67 , we have : @xmath70    if we consider @xmath71 and @xmath72 , then eq . ( [ flux ] ) becomes @xmath73 or @xmath74 this last equation is the mass conservation equation of the fluid and relates the vertical displacement of the water surface , @xmath29 , with the horizontal displacement of a vertical slice of water .",
    "to apply the second newton law to a small portion of the lamellar slice , @xmath75 , of water ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] ) , we should calculate the total force , @xmath76 , acting on it .",
    "this force depends on the pressure difference between the opposite sides of the slice : @xmath77    then , @xmath78 leads to @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the mass of the water slice , @xmath81 is the acceleration of the transversal section of water given by the second partial derivative of @xmath28 with respect to @xmath2 , and @xmath82 is the water density .    since @xmath83 where @xmath4 is the gravity acceleration",
