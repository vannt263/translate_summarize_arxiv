    "unusual properties @xcite , simplicity , and ability to manipulate the strength @xcite put the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in the focus of many research fields , where the mutual dependence of spin and coordinate motion is important @xcite . for several decades , solids and solid - state structures were the systems to study the effects of spin - orbit coupling for electrons @xcite and holes @xcite . recently , at least two completely new classes of systems with spin - orbit coupling were discovered and became new research fields .",
    "the first class is cold atoms in highly coherent laser fields @xcite . for both types of particles , in addition to the soc",
    ", an effective magnetic field can be produced optically .",
    "studies of spin - orbit coupled cold atoms are related to the properties of new phases ( see e.g. @xcite ) and macroscopic spin dynamics @xcite .",
    "the other class is topological insulators @xcite , considered as promising elements for the spintronics applications .",
    "the very general character of the spin - orbit coupling should have consequences for the fundamental quantum mechanics of single particles and their ensembles and stimulate the search for these consequences in experimentally realizable system .",
    "motivated by the interest in the observability of the effects of spin - orbit coupling on the basic quantum mechanical level , here we show that and how it is directly related to the quantum measurement of spin 1/2 in terms of the procedure proposed by von neumann .",
    "we begin with a general hamiltonian ( assume @xmath2 ) of spin - orbit coupling linear in the two - dimensional particle momentum : @xmath3 , \\qquad \\hat{h}_{z}=\\frac{\\delta } { 2}\\left ( \\mathbf{b}\\cdot{\\bm\\sigma } \\right ) , \\label{hamiltonianso}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 with corresponding components of gauge potential @xmath6 @xmath7 is the effective mass , and @xmath8 is the pauli matrices pseudovector . here",

    "the conventional rashba coupling is given by @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 , while the dresselhaus couping is given by @xmath15 @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the corresponding coordinate system vectors ) .",
    "the value of @xmath22 is in the range from 1 - 10 cm / s for cold atoms to 10@xmath23 cm / s for electrons in semiconductor nanostructures and 10@xmath24 - 10@xmath25 cm / s for and topological insulators , where the kinetic energy vanishes @xcite , and surfaces with extremely strong spin - orbit coupling @xcite .    as a result ,",

    "now we can see a connection between hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) and a quantum spin measurement .",
    "consider a quantum system characterized by a multicomponent operator @xmath32 coupled to momentum @xmath33 of another system , `` pointer '' , as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the corresponding coupling strength .",

    "thus , by tracing the pointer position , one can expect tracing the motion of the operator components of @xmath40 in the case of spin - orbit coupling , @xmath33 is the particle momentum , and @xmath39 represents the spin components , as can be seen from eqs.([hamiltonian])-([hamiltonianso ] ) .",
    "this simple observation , being the idea behind the von neumann measurement , can have interesting consequences , including entanglement of the spin and coordinate degrees of freedom and , correspondingly , a spin dephasing in the measurement procedure , for experimentally realizable systems .",
    "we will describe these effects in this paper .",
    "moreover , we will demonstrate , that the dynamics of the pointer due to the hamiltonian @xmath41 e.g. , its kinetic energy , influences the measurement procedure and its accuracy .",
    "this approach corresponds to the measurements by solving dynamical models , with some of them recently reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to perform a spin measurement",
    ", we choose the spin - orbit coupling @xmath42 switched on for a finite time interval @xmath43 making the hamiltonian time - independent during the measurement . as a result ,",

    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "this approach will be applied to a simultaneous measurement of noncommuting spin components for a two - dimensional particle with the rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we will show why the attempt of instantaneous measurement fails , and that the actual measured quantities are the averaged over the measurement time spin components . in section 3",
    "we study the von neumann measurement and measurement - induced dephasing of a spin rotating in a magnetic field for a one - dimensional particle with non - commuting spin - orbit and zeeman terms .",
    "in section 4 we summarize the results and show possible extension and generalizations of the relation between spin - orbit coupling and spin measurement procedures .",
    "the heisenberg uncertainty relation established the limit on precision of instantaneous measurement of observables corresponding to two non - commuting operators in terms of the expectation value of their commutator .",
    "although this general statement is one of the basic properties of quantum motion , the measurement procedure itself is still an unresolved issue @xcite even for momentum and coordinate observables .",
    "arthurs and kelly @xcite considered two meters employed to measure jointly particle s position and momentum .",
    "the analogue of the arthurs - kelly experiment for non - commuting spin components was proposed in ref .",
    "an implementation of such a measurement through coupling to radiation modes was considered in ref .",

    "@xcite . however , the straightforward interpretation of proposed experiments is hardly possible . in this section",
    "we remind the reader the measurement scheme using spin - orbit coupling @xcite , where coordinate pointers are attached to non - commuting spin components . for this purpose",
    "we return to the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) and study spin dynamics of a single wavepacket in the absence of external magnetic field .    without loss of generality",
    ", we choose the spin - orbit coupling in the conventional rashba form . neglecting the internal dynamics of the pointer ( exact condition will be given further in the text )",

    "after some time , dependent on @xmath90 , the spin explores other feynman walks , and the dependence becomes asymptotically linear with the main term @xmath239 .",
    "the inset shows the increase in the packet width with time , where different displacements @xmath240 are possible due to the spin precession in magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath241-dependences here split and the packets start to broaden at dimensionless @xmath230 close to @xmath242 , where the spin makes a half - turn .",
    "we emphasize that the packet broadening and nonlinear @xmath243dependence are solely due to the noncommutativity of the zeeman and the rashba terms .      to better understand the coupled coordinate- and spin dynamics we consider the evolution of spin components by tracing the quantities @xmath244 , \\label{sigmat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] calculated with the spin density matrix @xmath245 : @xmath246 with the increase in @xmath230 , the different evolution of spinor components @xmath247 and @xmath248 produces a spin - coordinate entanglement and makes the initially pure spin state with @xmath249 , a mixed one with @xmath250 . as a result , the spin subsystem experiences a decoherence in the measurement process , and spin moves from the initial position at the bloch sphere @xmath251 to the inner part of the corresponding bloch ball , where this sum is less than one .",
    "the spin - dependent velocity in a system with hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_1d ] ) determines the general relation between expectation values of spin and coordinate as @xmath252    we consider three time - dependent observables : @xmath253 @xmath254 , and @xmath255 , where the explicit @xmath230-dependence is omitted for brevity .",
    "figure [ fig : fig6](b ) shows the spiral behavior of @xmath254 and @xmath256 strongly dependent on the packet width .",
    "the decreasing with time radius of the spiral here corresponds to the decoherence in the spin subspace .",
    "the final stationary values depend on the width of the packet , that is on the accuracy of the measurement . for a narrow packet ,",
    "the displacement of the stationary point from the initial one is relatively small and increases , same as the maximum radius of the spiral , with the initial width @xmath90 .",

    "one can use semiclassical integration rule by substituting in the integrands @xmath263 and @xmath264 with @xmath265 and @xmath266 with zero @xcite . then , by using eqs.([expht ] ) and ( [ psi_function ] ) , with the green function ( [ g11 ] ) , ( [ g12 ] ) , ( [ g22 ] ) , initial state ( [ psip ] ) , and definition of observables ( [ sigmat ] ) , we obtain @xmath267 in the form : @xmath268   + \\sin\\beta\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi(q\\cos\\theta   + 1 ) } { \\left(q+\\cos\\theta\\right)^{2}+\\sin^{2}\\theta}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we can study limiting cases of eq.([sigmapar ] ) .",
    "first limit is the weak spin - orbit coupling , that is a broad initial packet , @xmath269 here the range of possible momenta goes to zero , one can substitute @xmath270 in the fraction in the integral to obtain @xmath271 for a strong spin - orbit coupling , that is for a narrow packet , one can neglect lower than @xmath272 powers of @xmath262 and obtain @xmath273    the orthogonal component can be written as @xmath274 in limiting cases considered as below eq.([sigmapar ] ) we obtain @xmath275 for weak spin - orbit coupling and @xmath276 for strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the component @xmath277 @xmath278 for any coupling strength .",
    "it is instructive to compare the obtained asymptotic behavior with that intuitively expected in a simple case of commuting zeeman and spin - orbit couplings , that is @xmath279 . here",
    "the overlap of the functions @xmath280 and @xmath281 vanishes on the time scale of the order of @xmath282 and the spin state becomes mixed as can be seen in eq.([denmat ] ) .",
    "the expectation values of spin components @xmath283 and @xmath284 are time - independent .",
    "the @xmath209component changes from @xmath285 to @xmath286 , in agreement with ( [ sigmapar ] ) and ( [ sigmaperp ] ) . the spirals in fig.[fig : fig6 ] are transformed into projection of a log connecting points @xmath287 and @xmath288 on the bloch sphere and inside the bloch ball , correspondingly .",
    "in summary , we have shown that motion in the spin - orbit coupling fields simulates a von neumann measurement of spin-1/2 system .",
    "the spin - orbit dynamics maps spin motion onto a spin - dependent coordinate walk , thus making distinguishable otherwise hidden spins virtual histories .",
    "the accuracy of the measurement depends on the resources available in the momentum space , that is on the spatial width of the initial state .",
    "we considered two examples of such a procedure : simultaneous measurement of two non - commuting spin components and measurement of a spin rotating in external magnetic field . in the first case , since the virtual feynman paths can be divided into infinitely small pieces in the time domain , the produced angular density distribution is time - independent at any measurement duration . as a result ,",
    "any attempt of instantaneous measurement of non - commuting spin components fails , and the averages of the spin components over the measurement time are observed with the accuracy determined by the width of the initial wavepacket . in the second case",
    "the average of a single spin component corresponding to spin - orbit coupling axis for a particle moving in one dimension is measured .",
    "we showed that even if the mass of the particle is infinite , the initial packet broadens due to spin - orbit coupling , the motion in the coordinated space is complicated , spin state becomes mixed rather than pure , and decoherence in the spin subspace occurs .",
    "to conclude , we mention several extensions and generalizations of the von neumann measurement procedure seen in the physics of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "first extension can be related to the manifestation of the zeno effect @xcite , that is slowing down the dynamics of a constantly measured system .",
    "recent direct calculations indeed demonstrated that in the presence of strong driving electric fields @xcite , or strong spin - orbit coupling @xcite the dynamics of the system becomes much slower than expected from the linear response approach .",
    "it would be of interest to see the relation between these results and the zeno effect .",
    "second extension can be related to generalizations for other systems and hamiltonians .",
    "recent development in producing synthetic spin - orbit coupling allows one to realize the three - dimensional spin - orbit coupling @xcite in the @xmath289 form .",
    "therefore , an attempt of von neumann measurement of all three spin components in a single experiment providing another realization of full qubit monitoring @xcite can be done .",
    "similar problem is spin - orbit coupling in a system with su(3 ) symmetry as can be realized in cold atomic gases @xcite . here",
    "the linear in momentum hamiltonian is expressed is terms of eight generators of the su(3 ) group rather than simply in terms of spin 1 axis projections . as a result ,",
    "a problem of spin component measurements becomes more complicated than in the case of spin 1/2 , where the number of the su(2 ) group generators is the same as the number of the coordinate axes .",
    "another example is provided by holes in two - dimensional semiconductor structures , presenting the realization @xcite of the @xmath290 rather than linear in @xmath291 rashba model .",
    "although the von neumann measurement assumes the linear coupling , a similar qualitative analysis can be done here .",
    "taking into account that the spin - orbit splitting here is proportional to @xmath292 , where @xmath293 is the coupling constant @xcite , the conditions of accurate measurement can be reformulated as @xmath294 and @xmath295 and , therefore , a narrow packet ( small @xmath90 ) is needed for this purpose .",
    "the realization of this measurement requires a separate discussion .",
