    "there is a wide observational evidence @xcite that the observed cluster x - ray luminosity scales with temperature with a slope which is steeper than that predicted by the self - similar scaling relations ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this implies that low temperature clusters have central densities lower than expected @xcite .",
    "this break of self - similarity is usually taken as a strong evidence that non - gravitational heating of the icm has played an important role in the icm evolution . a popular model which has been considered as a heating mechanism for the icm is supernovae ( sne ) driven - winds @xcite .",
    "an alternative view is that radiative cooling and the subsequent galaxy formation can explain the observed @xmath3 relation because of the removal of low - entropy gas at the cluster cores @xcite . in this proceedings i present preliminary results from a large set of hydrodynamical sph simulations of galaxy clusters .",
    "the physical modeling of the gas includes a number of processes ( see later ) , and the simulations have been performed in order to investigate the consistency of simulated cluster scaling relations against a number of data .",
    "hydrodynamical treesph simulations have been performed in physical coordinates for a sample of 120 test clusters .",
    "a detailed description of the procedure can be found in valdarnini ( 2003 , v03 ) .",
    "the cosmological model is a flat cdm model , with vacuum energy density @xmath4 , matter density parameter @xmath5 and hubble constant @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is the value of the baryonic density .",
    "the clusters are the 120 most massive ones identified at @xmath8 in a cosmological @xmath9body run with a box size of @xmath10 mpc .",
    "the virial temperatures range from @xmath11 down to @xmath12 .",
    "the simulations have @xmath13 gas particles .",
    "the cooling function of the gas particles also depends on the gas metallicity , and cold gas particles are subject to star formation .",
    "once a star particle is created it will release energy into the surrounding gas through sn explosions of type ii and ia . the feedback energy ( @xmath14 erg ) is returned to the nearest neighbor gas particles , according to its lifetime and imf .",
    "sn explosions also inject enriched material into the icm , thus increasing its metallicity with time .",
    "observational variables of the simulated clusters are plotted in fig . 1 as a function of the cluster temperature @xmath1",
    ". different symbols are for different redshifts ( @xmath8 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) . for the sake of clarity ,",
    "not all the points of the numerical sample are plotted in the figure .",

    "a comparison with real data of a small sample subset ( four clusters , see v03 ) shows a good agreement with the measured values .",

    "the fraction of hot gas @xmath24 is defined within a given radius as the ratio of the mass of hot gas @xmath25 to the total cluster mass @xmath26 .",
    "the fraction @xmath0 has been calculated at a radius enclosing a gas overdensity of @xmath21 relative to the critical density .",
    "the values of @xmath0 of the numerical cluster sample are plotted in panel ( b ) .",
    "there is a clear tendency for the @xmath0 distributions to increase with cluster temperature .",
    "this is in accord with theoretical predictions of the radiative cooling model @xcite , and with numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "a subsample of the @xmath0 distribution at @xmath8 is found to be statistically consistent ( v03 ) with the data of arnoud & evrard ( 1999 ) .",
    "furthermore , sanderson et al . ( 2003 ) found strong observational evidence for a dependence of @xmath0 with @xmath1 .",
    "the values of the bolometric x - ray luminosity @xmath27 are shown in panel ( c ) as a function of the cluster temperature .",
    "mass - weighted temperatures have been used as unbiased estimators of the spectral temperatures @xcite .",
    "a central region of size @xmath28 has been excised  @xcite in order to remove the contribution to @xmath27 of the central cooling flow .",
    "the @xmath27 of the simulations at @xmath8 are in good agreement with the data  ( v03 ) over the entire range of temperatures .",
    "an additional run has been performed for the cluster with the lowest temperature , but with a sn feedback energy of @xmath29 erg for both snii and ia .",
    "the final @xmath27 of the run is very similar to that of standard run .",
    "this demonstrates that the final x - ray luminosities of the simulations are not sensitive to the amount of sn feedback energy that has heated the icm .",
    "the core entropies of the clusters are displayed in panel ( d ) against the cluster temperatures .",
    "the cluster entropy is defined as @xmath22 , where @xmath30 is the electron density .",
    "the core entropy is calculated at a radius which is @xmath31 of the cluster virial radius .",
    "the result indicates that for low temperatures part of the sample has clusters with core entropies which approach a floor at @xmath32kev @xmath33 , while for some clusters the decline of entropy with temperature is steeper and close to the self - similar predictions ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "this different behaviour could be due to the different dynamical histories of the clusters .",
    "it is worth stressing that for all the plotted quantities there is little evolution below @xmath35 .    to summarize , simulation results give final x - ray properties in broad agreement with the data .",
    "these findings support the so - called radiative model , where the x - ray properties of the icm are driven by the efficiency of galaxy formation rather than by the heating due to non - gravitational processes ."
