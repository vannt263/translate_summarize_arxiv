    "among many recent braneworld proposals , a particularly interesting idea called brane - induced gravity was put forth by dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) @xcite . in this approach the gravitational force between masses on",
    "the brane should arise from the exchange of an unstable bulk graviton resonance , which falls apart at very large scales , instead of a stable zero - mode graviton governed by the usual four - dimensional ( 4d ) general relativity ( gr ) . far from sources the law of gravity",
    "is modified , and changes from the 4d to a fully higher - dimensional one .",
    "this is similar to the approach of @xcite , which is known to suffer from problems with ghosts @xcite ( see however @xcite for a possible cure of the ghost - induced maladies )",
    ". the brane - induced gravity setup of dgp may be free of ghosts in perturbation theory @xcite , and so it is an interesting arena to explore modifications of gravity at large distances . in nave perturbation theory",
    ", the modifications appear already at the level of linearized theory , where one finds that the tensor structure of the graviton - matter coupling changes from its form in 4d gr @xcite .",
    "indeed , around flat space , a small perturbation @xmath0 is sourced by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 instead of @xmath3 , because of the extra scalar polarization of the massive graviton . since this coupling",
    "does not depend on the graviton mass , the factor @xmath4 would appear to persist even as @xmath5 .",
    "this is an example of van dam - veltman - zakharov ( vdvz ) discontinuity @xcite , which could modify the predictions for the solar system tests of general relativity .",
    "however , vainshtein has argued @xcite that the nave perturbation theory for massive gravity breaks down in the limit @xmath5 because it is a double expansion in both @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "instead , the argument goes , one needs to expand around the curved background created by the source mass , where the curvature generated by the source  screens \" the scalar graviton , so that the modified perturbation theory smoothly reduces to conventional gr as @xmath5 .",
    "basically , it is necessary to take into account the non - linear nature of gravity to properly restore gauge invariance which is required to ensure the decoupling of the massive modes as @xmath5 . a similar behavior has also been noticed in non - abelian gauge theories @xcite .",
    "the issue of strong coupling in gravity with ir modifications , and in particular its implications for dgp models have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the works @xcite specifically address the longitudinal graviton and its matter coupling , and suggest that brane extrinsic curvature may indeed play the role of a coupling controller .",
    "when a source mass is placed on the brane , it bends the brane . the brane extrinsic curvature which locally responds to the source may in turn help to tame the perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this interplay between the source - induced background curvature and the scalar graviton coupling may thus be a key ingredient of the  gravity filter \" of @xcite .",
    "it is therefore essential to explore in detail this interplay of the curvature and the coupling strength beyond perturbation theory in order to clarify the status of the effective 4d theory .",
    "however , the dgp equations are very difficult to solve exactly for compact sources localized on the brane @xcite .    in the previous paper @xcite",
    "we have presented the first explicit example of an exact solution for a localized particle in dgp models .",
    "we have obtained the gravitational field for a relativistic particle on a tensional brane in 5d , which generalizes 4d gravitational shock waves @xcite in de sitter space @xcite . in this paper",
    "we follow up with a detailed derivation of the shock wave metrics for both the normal branch and the self - inflating branch variants of dgp braneworlds @xcite . focusing on the extreme relativistic limit",
    ", we find that the brane - localized terms are indeed a very efficient  gravity filter \" . at short distances",
    ", the wave profile behaves exactly like in 4d gr @xcite .",
    "the deviations appear only far from the source , where they come as odd powers of the distance from the source in the units of the cosmological horizon length , as opposed to the 4d gr corrections in de sitter space , which only come as even powers .",
    "we also look at gravitational scattering of relativistic particles in dgp braneworlds , and find that to the leading order it behaves the same as in the 4d case .",
    "we note that our solutions do not provide a direct answer to the conundrum of strong couplings of the scalar graviton .",
    "however , we do find that the scalar graviton field is not turned on in these metrics .",
    "this would not come as a surprise in a weakly - coupled perturbation theory , where the scalar graviton will not be sourced by ultra - relativistic particles since to the leading order their source vanishes , @xmath8 .",
    "in other words , in the relativistic limit , one finds that the conformal symmetry is restored , and the solution is form - invariant under boosts .",
    "hence the gravitational shock wave of 4d gr is also a solution in brans - dicke theory . in a more relevant case of very fast particles with non - zero rest mass",
    ", the corrections from the mass to the relativistic wave profile should be suppressed by the source mass - to - momentum ratio @xmath9 .",
    "our results show that decoupling of the scalar graviton persists in the relativistic limit in dgp , and so the dangerous strongly coupled mode identified in perturbation theory does not destroy the solutions at large momenta after all .",
    "this suggests that even for the particles with nonzero rest mass the gravitational field may be under control .",
    "indeed , since local physics in dgp obeys the usual 4d diffeomorphism invariance , we can always pick a very fast - moving observer to explore the field of a massive source , and transform all of the relevant physics to her rest frame . in her frame , thanks to relativity principle , the source mass would appear to move with a very high speed @xmath10 , and therefore its gravitational field should be well approximated by our shock wave solutions .",
    "for a sufficiently fast observer , the corrections due to the mass should be suppressed by the powers of @xmath11 .",
    "this suggests that if organized as an expansion in powers of @xmath12 , perturbation theory may be under control ( however , by itself this may not help with any ghost infestations on the self - inflating branch @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we construct the background solutions for a tensional brane without particle excitations on it .",
    "they are de sitter vacua of 5d dgp . in section",
    "iii we present a detailed derivation of the gravitational shock waves , and show that they can be written in terms of two - variable hypergeometric functions .",
    "we outline a spectacular new non - perturbative channel for production of bulk gravitons on the self - inflating branch , when gravity is modified at exactly the brane de sitter radius , in section iv , and consider the limiting form of the solutions at short distances , as well as several special cases in section v. we then turn to the problem of gravitational scattering of relativistic particles in section vi , and summarize in section vii .",
    "brane - induced gravity models @xcite are given by a bulk action with metric kinetic terms in both the bulk and on the brane .",
    "in the case of one extra dimension , @xmath13 here @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the 5d metric and the induced 4d metric on the brane , respectively , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are their ricci tensors , @xmath18 is the usual gibbons - hawking term necessary in space - times with boundaries ( defined as the trace of the extrinsic curvature of the brane , for variational principles see e.g. @xcite ) , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 the brane tension and matter lagrangian ( which we separate from each other explicitly ) .",
    "the indices @xmath21 and @xmath22 are bulk and 3-brane world - volume indices , and the gravitational couplings are controlled by the bulk and brane planck scales , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "varying this action away from the brane one finds the gravitational field equations in the bulk , which in the case of empty bulk admit locally 5d minkowski solution .",
    "the brane dynamics can then be incorporated via the modified israel junction condition @xcite , which in the case of brane - induced gravity in addition to the brane extrinsic curvature also receives corrections from the intrinsic curvature as well , arising from the variation of @xmath17 .",
    "this junction condition can be viewed as the equation of motion of the brane , defining the world - volume the brane sweeps in the locally minkowski bulk . in the case of empty bulk",
    ", one can readily transform to the rest frame of the brane by going to the gaussian normal coordinates for the 5d metric , @xmath25 , and incorporate the brane equations of motion as @xmath26-function terms in the bulk field equations , taking a very compact form . in 5d ,",
    "those field equations are @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 are bulk and 3-brane - localized einstein tensors , and @xmath30 is the brane stress - energy , respectively . in this coordinate system",
    "one can easily orbifold the bulk , by imposing a @xmath31 symmetry @xmath32 around the brane situated at @xmath33 .    for a brane with tension @xmath34 and without any localized or distributed matter sources , @xmath35 .",
    "the corresponding solutions describe de sitter vacua on the brane .",
    "the symmetries of the brane - bulk system then dictate the form of the metric , which must be given by the warped 4d de sitter space in a locally flat bulk @xcite @xmath36 the replacement @xmath37 implements the orbifolding procedure .",
    "aside from the parameter @xmath38 , which can take values @xmath39 in ( [ background ] ) , this metric is identical to the 5d version @xcite of the inflating vilenkin - ipser - sikivie domain wall @xcite . in what follows",
    "we shall use the static patch de sitter metric , @xmath40 instead of the spatially flat one utilized in @xcite .",
    "the space - time of ( [ background ] ) is a 4d de sitter hyperboloid in a 5d minkowski bulk . here",
    "@xmath38 arises because we can retain either the interior @xmath41 or the exterior @xmath42 of the hyperboloid after orbifolding , thanks to the brane intrinsic curvature @xmath17 .",
    "the junction conditions relate the 4d curvature and the brane tension as @xcite @xmath43 the simplest way to derive this equation is to substitute the metric ( [ background ] ) into the field equations ( [ fieldeqs ] ) , recall that away from the brane ( [ background ] ) is just a different parameterization of the locally flat minkowski metric , and compute the terms proportional to @xmath44 , which in this case arise from the double @xmath45-derivatives in the bulk terms on the lhs in ( [ fieldeqs ] ) , and from the brane curvature terms . then matching them with the tension source yields ( [ hubble ] ) .",
    "we will revisit this derivation in more detail in section iii .",
    "focusing on the solutions with @xmath46 ( because @xmath47 cases are their @xmath48 transforms ) , on the normal branch defined by the choice @xmath49 , we see that the equation ( [ hubble ] ) reduces to the 4d friedman equation in the limit @xmath50 , @xmath51 . in this case in the bulk we keep the interior of the hyperboloid .",
    "it has finite volume and so the perturbative 4d graviton exists .",
    "the brane curvature terms @xmath52 suppress the couplings of the @xmath53 graviton kk modes , producing the 4d effective theory when @xmath50 .",
    "fig : three ] .",
    "this case corresponds to keeping the unshaded region of the bulk , i.e. the interior of the de sitter hyperboloid .",
    ".2 cm     on the brane and depict another , so that the diagram looks like two cones glued along their base , with the hyperboloid of the brane world volume inscribed inside the cones . in the case of the normal branch , in the bulk one retains the interior of the brane world - volume , denoted with @xmath49 . for the self - inflating branch ,",
    "one retains the exterior , marked @xmath54 .",
    "the static patch on the brane is the interior of the diamond - shaped region on the brane world - volume .",
    "[ fig : three ] ]    on the other hand , on the self - inflating branch , defined by @xmath54 , at low tensions @xmath55 , from the eq .",
    "( [ hubble ] ) one finds @xmath56 . in this case in the bulk one keeps the exterior of the hyperboloid that opens up to infinity , corresponding to the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] .",
    "this bulk volume is infinite , and so there is no perturbative 4d graviton .",
    "the effective theory arises only from the exchange of the bulk resonance .",
    "we note that this solution resembles witten s  bubble of nothing \" @xcite ( see also @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] . ) , which first collapses from infinite size to a minimum , and bounces back to infinity , gobbling up the bulk along the way .",
    "however now the bubble wall carries finite energy density .",
    "this may help protect the bulk from being  eaten \" by  nothing \" too quickly .",
    "namely , the probability of nucleating a  bubble of nothing \" is given by the exponential of the negative action of its euclidean extension , @xmath57 .",
    "if we take the self - inflating branch solutions ( [ background ] ) and glue them to a euclidean hemisphere at the minimum radius to model bubble nucleation , we find that the corresponding action is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the volume of the sphere of radius @xmath60 ( for a simple calculation of the action with gibbons - hawking terms see e.g. @xcite ) . in the limit @xmath61 , @xmath50 , only big bubbles with a large euclidean action , @xmath62 , are nucleated . therefore ,",
    "if the tension and the bulk planck scale are somehow fixed to be much smaller than the 4d planck scale @xmath23 ( see e.g. @xcite for the discussion of scales in brane - induced gravity ) the nucleation rate of  bubbles of nothing \" may be sufficiently slow to render the self - inflating branch long - lived .",
    "we now turn to the construction of the gravitational shock wave fields generated by relativistic particles moving on the brane in dgp @xcite .",
    "imagine that a photon is moving on a tensional brane , with a momentum @xmath63 . because it is a relativistic particle trapped on the brane , it moves along a null geodesic of the brane - induced metric . by the principle of equivalence , its momentum generates gravitational field , since it contributes to the stress - energy tensor .",
    "there are two approaches for generating the gravitational field solutions .",
    "one could start with a linearized solution for a massive particle at rest , and boost it to relativistic speed , simultaneously taking the limit @xmath64 such that @xmath65 remains constant .",
    "this is how the solutions in 4d were originally found @xcite .",
    "the procedure is completely analogous to the method of generating the electro - magnetic potential of a charged massless particle ( for a nice review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the same procedure has also been applied to the massless particles moving in maximally symmetric spaces @xcite and randall - sundrum braneworld models @xcite .",
    "the reason why this procedure works as a method of generating _ exact _ solutions of gravitational field equations is that if we expand the exact metric for a massive source in powers of the mass @xmath66 , after a boost to relativistic speeds the quadratic and higher powers of @xmath66 vanish because there is only one factor of the boost parameter @xmath67 in the metric , which is compensated by one power of @xmath66 when @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "hence the linearized solution becomes exact .",
    "essentially , in the extreme relativistic limit the solution becomes scale invariant , and the non - linear effects which are controlled by the fixed ratio @xmath71 drop out .",
    "the previous discussion on boosting linearized solutions describing point masses to generate exact solutions of gravitational field equations illuminates the nature of the solution as a planar shock wave . because of the infinite boosting the field lines of the gravitational field",
    "become confined to a plane perpendicular to the direction of motion . in terms of the null coordinate @xmath72 which parameterizes the world - line of the particle @xmath73 , the field experiences a jump at @xmath74 encoding causal propagation of the source .",
    "when the particle flies by an observer , its gravitational field perturbs the observer at precisely that instant @xcite .",
    "this property allowed dray and t hooft to develop a very elegant cut - and - paste technique @xcite to find solutions , which they applied to asymptotically flat 4d backgrounds .",
    "higher - dimensional examples were considered in @xcite .",
    "this technique was later applied to general 4d gr backgrounds by sfetsos @xcite . to circumvent the need for a detailed form of the linearized solution for a localized mass in dgp",
    ", we will apply a variant of this cut - and - paste technique to dgp .",
    "we start by rewriting ( [ background ] ) in suitable null coordinates , defining @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we also introduce a new bulk coordinate @xmath77 .",
    "it simplifies evaluating the curvature tensors with a conformal map as in @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath78 because the warp factor and its derivative are equal to unity on the brane . in terms of these coordinates",
    ", we can rewrite the metric ( [ background ] ) in the following form : @xmath79 suppose now that a photon moves along a null geodesic on the brane , let s say the @xmath73-axis of the coordinates utilized in ( [ nullback ] ) .",
    "the equation of this null geodesic is @xmath74 .",
    "if we choose the origin of this photon at infinite past as the north pole of the static patch , an observer located there sees a photon streaming away along the past horizon .",
    "following dray and t hooft , we introduce the shock wave on top of the background ( [ nullback ] ) by including a jump in the @xmath73 coordinate at @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "we substitute @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the shock wave profile , whose precise form is to be determined by requiring that combining ( [ nullback ] ) and ( [ jump ] ) still remains a solution of the field equations .",
    "the wave profile @xmath81 depends only on the spatial coordinates transverse to the wave , which in our case are the angles on the 2-sphere and the bulk coordinate @xmath82 .",
    "here @xmath83 is the heaviside step function .",
    "note that in flat 4d background ( [ jump ] ) is a trivial diffeomorphism if @xmath84 @xcite . in that surroundings , if @xmath85 , the replacement rule for @xmath86 in ( [ jump ] ) ensures this is not just a diffeomorphism . changing the coordinates to @xmath87",
    "we find @xmath88 .",
    "substituting @xmath89 in ( [ nullback ] ) and dropping the carets , we obtain the anstz for the metric with the shock wave included : @xmath90 note that with this , the anstz for the induced metric on the brane is @xmath91 now we take the anstz ( [ wave ] ) , ( [ brane ] ) and substitute it into the field equations ( [ fieldeqs ] ) , where we also include the photon stress - energy contribution in the source on the rhs .",
    "thus the total stress - energy tensor with a photon moving along @xmath74 is @xmath92 we have chosen the coordinates on the 2-sphere such that the photon trajectory is at @xmath93 .    to evaluate the curvature we utilize the conformal transformation trick as in @xcite , splitting the metric as @xmath94 , where @xmath95 , and @xmath96 a straightforward albeit tedious computation , where we treat @xmath97 and its derivatives as distributions , and use the distributional identities @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 @xcite , yields the ricci tensor for the conformal metric ( [ confwave ] ) . the stress - energy ( [ stress ] ) is automatically conserved , @xmath101 , so the matter sector field equations are satisfied .",
    "we note that this computation also yields automatically the components of the ricci tensor of the induced metric on the brane , which appear as the subset of the curvature tensor for the conformal metric ( [ confwave ] ) , because @xmath102 and the coordinates in ( [ wave ] ) are gaussian , as is obvious from comparing ( [ brane ] ) and ( [ confwave ] ) .",
    "the resulting non - vanishing ricci tensor components are @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the ricci tensors of the metrics ( [ confwave ] ) and ( [ brane ] ) , and @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the indices and the metric on the unit 2-sphere , respectively . the operator @xmath108 is the laplacian on the unit 2-sphere .    using the conformal transformation @xmath109 which gives the relationship @xmath110 we finally find @xmath111 although ricci tensor vanishes away from the brane at @xmath112 even when the shock wave is present ( @xmath113 in ( [ riccicomp ] ) vanishes at @xmath114 by virtue of the field equations , see below )",
    ", the bulk is not minkowski any more , since the waves extend off the brane and deform the bulk .",
    "one would find their non - vanishing contributions away from the brane in the riemann tensor . now from ( [ ricciconf ] ) and ( [ riccicomp ] ) we can obtain the explicit form of the field equations ( [ fieldeqs ] ) .",
    "first , it is easy to check that we can rewrite ( [ fieldeqs ] ) as @xmath115 here @xmath116 is the covariant @xmath26-function on the unit 2-sphere , @xmath117 , which peaks at @xmath93 . substituting ( [ ricciconf ] ) and ( [ riccicomp ] ) in the first of ( [ riccieqs ] ) we recover just the background equation ( [ hubble ] ) , linking the hubble parameter @xmath118 and the brane tension @xmath19 .",
    "the new equation for the wave profile @xmath81 comes from the @xmath119 component of ( [ riccieqs ] ) .",
    "indeed , direct substitution of ( [ ricciconf ] ) and ( [ riccicomp ] ) yields a _ linear _ field equation for the wave profile : @xmath120 the remaining components of the second of ( [ riccieqs ] ) again reduce to the background equation ( [ hubble ] ) .",
    "thus ( [ feqn ] ) fully determines the shock wave profile @xmath81 .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath121 the bulk derivatives disappear , and we can factor out @xmath122 to recover the correct 4d de sitter equation of @xcite .",
    "now we can turn to solving ( [ feqn ] ) .",
    "it turns out that one has to carefully implement the boundary conditions for the single particle problem ( [ feqn ] ) in order to avoid additional singularities that would arise because the 2-sphere on which the particle propagates is compact @xcite .",
    "these boundary conditions are handled in the simplest way by adding an extra particle with the same momentum @xmath123 , running in the opposite direction in the static patch ( [ nullback ] ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , this two - source solution correctly represents the limit of infinite boost of the schwarzschild - de sitter geometry @xcite . so following @xcite we add an extra term , @xmath124 , on the rhs of ( [ feqn ] ) . here",
    "@xmath125 is peaked on the opposite pole on the 2-sphere , at @xmath126 ( see fig .",

( [ nullback ] ) ) , and transform further to the spherical polar coordinates in the bulk far from the brane , defined by @xmath222 then the asymptotic metric ( [ nonintwave ] ) becomes @xmath223 where @xmath224 , and @xmath225 is the line element on a unit 3-sphere . since this asymptotic metric is invariant under @xmath128 rotations , the solution looks like an imploding shell of energy in minkowski space . for a hint of how such a shell is generated , move away from @xmath226 and reconsider the boundary value problem ( [ bvprob ] ) while still keeping the non - integrable bulk wave function in the @xmath174 mode , as in eq .",
    "( [ specasymptotic ] )",
    ". then ( [ bvprob ] ) relates @xmath209 and @xmath210 according to @xmath227 thus we see that when @xmath177 , the localized mode @xmath228 can absorb fully the effect of the source @xmath229 .",
    "this is energetically favorable , because the non - integrable mode @xmath213 decouples because it has vanishing overlap with the brane where the source is located .",
    "hence we can set @xmath230 and forget about it .",
    "however in the limit @xmath173 the modifications of gravity occur at the scale equal to the cosmological horizon on the brane .",
    "brane and bulk begin to  resonate \" : in a time - dependent problem , as @xmath231 slowly , the localized @xmath174 mode would grow ever larger , spreading further out into the bulk .",
    "it would develop a larger overlap with the bulk graviton , so that it can produce delocalized gravitons in order to shed the energy which drives its unbounded growth . in this way as @xmath232 energy could escape into the bulk .",
    "this indicates an onset of a dramatic new instability , which warrants further investigation .",
    "in this section we consider @xmath81 on the brane , when @xmath112 ( i.e. @xmath191 ) , at transverse distances @xmath233 well inside the cosmological horizon , @xmath234 .",
    "note that we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ hubble ] ) as @xmath235 .",
    "this shows that on the normal branch @xmath236 can vary between zero , in which case we recover the 4d limit , and infinity , when we recover the 5d limit , with the  resonance \" discussed in detail in the previous section at @xmath176 . on the other hand , on the self - inflating branch ,",
    "@xmath237 or @xmath238 , as long as @xmath239 . in the limit @xmath240 on the self - inflating brane , as mentioned before , the tension vanishes .",
    "let us start with @xmath241",
    ". in this case ( [ intsols ] ) is identical to the 4d case on both branches .",
    "indeed , it can be expressed as @xmath242 where @xmath243 are the integrals @xmath244 which obey @xmath245 .",

    "thus , using @xmath245 , and noting that the regulator is now @xmath251 , also @xmath252 such that the final result for @xmath253 is @xmath254 to determine the ratio of the regulators @xmath255 , recall that they are the image of the regulator @xmath256 for the variable @xmath203 under the euler substitution for the integration variables in @xmath257 . that yields @xmath258 , so that @xmath259 therefore the singularities indeed cancel out , and @xmath260 - 1 \\ , .",

    "\\label{4dsols}\\ ] ] the metric transverse to the null particle on the brane is @xmath262 .",
    "therefore the proper  radial \" transverse distance for small polar angles @xmath130 is @xmath263 , so that @xmath264 .",
    "thus the shock wave profile ( [ 4dsols ] ) reduces precisely to the flat 4d solution @xcite : up to @xmath265 corrections , using the sign conventions of @xcite , we find @xmath266 as long as it is finite , the numerical value of the constant term in this equation is physically unimportant since a finite constant term in the shock wave profile in a flat 4d spacetime can always be changed by a simple 4d diffeomorphism @xcite .",
    "we can not write down the integrals which incorporate the @xmath267 corrections in closed form because they contain terms like @xmath268 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is easy to extract their short - distance effects : at short distances the singular @xmath267 powers in the integrand precisely cancel out . in the remainder",
    ", since the leading order singularity in ( [ intsols ] ) is logarithmic around @xmath168 , the additional logarithms soften the corrections further , and render them finite as @xmath269 .",
    "hence at short distances the solution looks exactly the same as in 4d , and the corrections are negligible when @xmath270 .",
    "in fact this behavior persists for any finite value of @xmath236 .",
    "we can see this from identifying the leading contribution in ( [ intsols ] ) at short distances . rewriting the integrals ( [ intsols ] ) by using the same substitutions @xmath271 and looking at the limit @xmath272 , we identify the leading singularity . after cancelling the spurious terms as above , for all values of @xmath177 and @xmath38",
    "the leading singularity at short distances comes from the term @xmath273 substituting @xmath264 , we recover the leading logarithm in ( [ 4dsolflat ] ) . the corrections to this result at larger distances in general differ from the corrections which arise when one expands the 4d de sitter solution ( [ 4dsols ] ) around the short distance limit describing shock waves in asymptotically flat space ( [ 4dsolflat ] ) , where one finds corrections to come as even powers of @xmath274 . in dgp , however , the corrections in ( [ logs ] ) will arise as odd powers of @xmath274 as well , starting with the linear term .",
    "this signals the presence of the fifth dimension concealed by the  gravity filter \" .",
    "therefore in general we will have @xmath275 where the coefficients",
    "@xmath276 are numbers that can be computed explicitly for given values of @xmath236 and @xmath38 , and we have seen that e.g. @xmath277 .      this analysis clearly demonstrates how the  gravity filter \" of @xcite works even beyond perturbation theory .",
    "it is encoded in the behavior of the coefficients in ( [ facsols ] ) , which decrease with the index @xmath217 of the legendre polynomials . because the graviton momentum on a transverse 2-sphere along de sitter brane is proportional to the index of the polynomial , @xmath292 , the modes with @xmath293 have amplitudes suppressed by @xmath294 .",
    "hence the short - distance divergences of the series can be no worse than a logarithm for any finite value of @xmath236 .",
    "indeed , at short distances @xmath295 , our shock waves are exactly the same as in 4d gr",
    ". for very low momenta the amplitudes are not suppressed , and so the shock wave profile changes towards 5d behavior at large distances @xmath296 .",
    "the limit @xmath297 on the normal branch illustrates this explicitly : when @xmath298 all modes with finite momenta remain unsuppressed and we recover 5d gravity .",
    "in this section we explore the scattering of two relativistic particles on the brane , @xmath299 , whose energy - momenta @xmath300 reach beyond the planck scale . in this regime",
    ", gravity will generically dominate over other interactions . indeed in 4d the effective coupling of gravitons to the packets of stress - energy is @xmath301 , where @xmath302 is the mandelstam @xmath303-parameter and @xmath304 the center - of - mass ( com ) energy @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that even if it exceeds the planck scale , the scattering cross section can still be reliably calculated using the methods of quantum field theory and gr @xcite .",
    "classical gravitational scattering has been studied before by death and payne @xcite , and the eikonal approximation calculations of @xcite are consistent with these results when the impact parameter @xmath305 is larger than the center - of - mass schwarzschild radius @xmath306 .",
    "the problem of planckian scattering and black hole formation has been revived recently in the context of braneworld constructions , since if the fundamental scale of gravity is really low , it may be possible to form black holes in high energy processes in colliders @xcite .",
    "thus one might wonder if such processes would be different in interesting ways in the framework of brane - induced gravity .",
    "however , in light of our findings above , it is clear that in the case of dgp with finite @xmath236 , when the impact parameter @xmath305 is smaller than the scale of modification of gravity , @xmath307 , planckian gravitational scattering will be very well approximated by the conventional 4d gr description .",
    "the differences are suppressed by the powers of @xmath12 and @xmath274 , which are both very small for highly energetic particles at short distances .",
    "let us now explicitly verify this . in the limit when the impact parameter is smaller than the dgp scale of modification of gravity , @xmath308 , the scattering is mediated predominantly by the 5d modes with transverse momenta @xmath309 .",
    "these individual 5d modes couple to a brane - localized source with the effective coupling @xmath310 as can be seen directly from ( [ facsols ] ) , and is consistent with @xcite .",
    "the latter term is the  gravity filter \" , which cuts off the influence of the modes with high transverse momentum .",
    "this is in contrast to what happens in the randall - sundrum models @xcite , where the modes carrying greater momentum compete more efficiently with the zero - mode graviton @xcite .",
    "the couplings can be rewritten as @xmath311 where the first factor is the usual @xmath287 bulk coupling , with the factor of @xmath312 accounting for the orbifolding , the second factor is the  volume dilution \" @xmath313 , and the last factor is the  filter \" . hence in order for a mode mediating a process on the brane with a transverse momentum @xmath294 to be strongly coupled , the process should unravel at com energies @xmath304 where @xmath314 , or therefore when @xmath315 .",
    "this should be compared with the requirements for the processes in the bulk , where the filter does not operate , because they are mediated by delocalized modes , which become strongly coupled at much lower scales @xmath316 .",
    "therefore we see that for the brane processes at energies @xmath317 , all the individual modes with momenta @xmath318 are in fact weakly coupled , with @xmath319 .",
    "however , the _ resonance _ mimicking the 4d graviton is _ strongly _ coupled . indeed , this resonance couples to the brane - localized sources with the effective strength @xmath320 where the uv cutoff @xmath321 is the highest transverse momentum for which the particle scattering is meaningful , which we roughly estimate as @xmath322 .",
    "thus @xmath323 up to logarithmic corrections , and so at com energies @xmath324 indeed @xmath325 , implying that the resonance - mediated scattering is in the strong coupling regime , where it should dominate over other processes much like the conventional 4d gravity",
    ". this description should be reasonable as long as the impact parameter @xmath305 is greater than the schwarzschild radius @xmath326 @xcite , where black holes are expected to form @xcite , and where one would need to go beyond the eikonal approximation .",
    "it is interesting however that in the regime of com energies @xmath327 , and impact parameters @xmath328 , which yield the com energy interval @xmath329 , the strongly coupled 4d graviton resonance is resolved into the individual weakly coupled bulk modes .    in this limit",
    ", the scattering amplitude can be extracted directly from the shock wave solutions @xcite . for a shock wave profile @xmath330 on the brane at @xmath112 , the formula relating the scattering amplitude in the eikonal approximation @xmath331 , expressed via",
    "the eikonal @xmath332 , and the shock wave metric ( [ wave ] ) is @xcite @xmath333 solving for @xmath334 and substituting in the shock wave profile formula from ( [ wave ] ) and ( [ logs ] ) , we obtain , taking into account our normalizations , @xmath335 where @xmath276 are the same numerical coefficients as in eq .",
    "( [ logs ] ) ( and @xmath277 ) .",
    "thus clearly as long as @xmath336 , the deviations away from the expression in 4d gr are completely negligible . hence as we have claimed above , the scattering will be very well approximated by the analysis in the conventional 4d theory @xcite .",
    "as a consequence one expects also that the processes of black hole formation in high energy collisions would behave as in 4d gr @xcite , controlled by the low energy value of the planck scale , @xmath337 gev , which is much too high to see such processes in forthcoming experiments at the lhc .",
    "this provides further illustration of the efficiency of the  gravity filter \" @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have given a detailed derivation and analysis of the exact gravitational shock wave metric in dgp models @xcite , first presented in our earlier paper @xcite .",
    "the shock wave solutions provide an explicit and concrete example of the  gravity filter \" mechanism of @xcite beyond perturbation theory . even on these exact solutions , the effects of the whole continuum of bulk graviton modes",
    "is dominated by a long range resonance , which mimics the standard 4d graviton out to distances @xmath338 .",
    "this is because the bulk modes which can transfer large transverse momentum on the brane @xmath339 have amplitudes suppressed by @xmath294 .",
    "hence at short distances @xmath340 their influence is cut off , and the rate of divergence of the shock wave metrics can be no worse than a logarithm for any finite value of @xmath236 , so that to the leading order the gravitational shock waves are exactly the same as in 4d gr .",
    "for very low momenta the amplitudes are not suppressed , leading to ir corrections which change the shock wave towards the 5d form at large distances @xmath341 .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the leading - order planckian scattering behaves in exactly the same way as in 4d gr .",
    "the differences come with the powers of @xmath12 and @xmath274 , and are very small for highly energetic particles at short distances .",
    "further , we have noted a spectacular new channel for energy loss into the bulk on the self - inflating branch , which arises when gravity is modified at exactly the brane de sitter radius .    we have argued earlier @xcite that our exact shock waves may also provide for a new arena to explore the scalar graviton sector in dgp . in the relativistic limit pursued here and in @xcite",
    "the scalar graviton has decoupled , in spite of the strong coupling issues that were encountered in nave perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "however one can imagine taking a very fast , but not ultra - relativistic observer who explores the field of a non - vanishing source mass . in this limit , one may treat the rest mass of the source as a perturbation of the shock wave geometry , and study how it sources the scalar graviton , and what happens to the graviton perturbation theory around the shock wave .",
    "this could reveal new aspects of modified gravitational physics in the ir , and help illuminate the status of effective 4d theory in dgp .",
