    "we take all three indications seriously and thus discuss the phenomenological analysis of all existing neutrino data in terms of    _ 3 active + 1 sterile neutrino .",
    "_    we will consider the topics of the nature of the possible neutrino mass spectra , constraints on the neutrino mixing matrix from the oscillation data and from big - bang nucleosynthesis , and finally checks and consequences ensuing from the favoured neutrino mass spectra and the associated mixing matrices .    in the following we will use the abbreviations sbl for short - baseline , lbl for long - baseline and bbn for big - bang nucleosynthesis .",

    "we assume the ordering @xmath15 for the neutrino masses .",
    "the most striking feature of neutrino masses and mixing is the quantum - mechanical effect of neutrino oscillations @xcite ( for a review on the early years of neutrino oscillations see ref .",
    "the transition ( @xmath16 ) or survival ( @xmath17 ) probability for @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the distance between neutrino source and detector and @xmath22 is the neutrino energy .",

    "the requirement that the phase ( [ phase ] ) is larger than 0.1 leads to a sensitivity estimate of @xmath35 ev@xmath32 .      at present , indications that neutrinos are massive and mixed have been found in solar neutrino experiments ( homestake @xcite , kamiokande @xcite , gallex @xcite , sage @xcite and super - kamiokande @xcite ) , in atmospheric neutrino experiments ( kamiokande @xcite , imb @xcite , soudan @xcite , super - kamiokande @xcite and macro @xcite ) and in the lsnd experiment @xcite ( see also the review @xcite ) . from the analyses of the data of these experiments in terms of neutrino oscillations one infers the following scales of neutrino mass - squared differences :    * * solar neutrino deficit : * interpreted as effect of neutrino oscillations , the relevant value of the mass - squared difference is determined as @xcite @xmath36 the two possibilities for @xmath37 correspond , respectively , to the msw @xcite and to the vacuum oscillation solutions of the solar neutrino problem .",

    "the same transition is rather 0.04 at most @xcite .",
    "a similar stringent bound can be derived on the probability of @xmath174 transitions .",
    "* sbl @xmath108 transitions : * + if @xmath146 holds ( see previous section ) , then the quantity @xmath175 is very small ( see eq.([cs ] ) ) . in this case",
    "it can be shown that @xmath176 is valid @xcite . due to the smallness of @xmath88 ( see fig .",
    "[ a0plot ] ) the transition amplitude @xmath177 is below @xmath165 @xcite , which also serves as a check for the validity of the bbn constraint on @xmath6 .    *",
    "@xmath0h decay : * + let us assume that @xmath178 .",
    "then one easily derives the relations @xcite @xmath179 for the mass @xmath180 measured in tritium decay . since in scheme ( a ) one has @xmath181",
    ", it might be possible in the future to see a neutrino mass in tritium decay , whereas this mass effect is suppressed in scheme ( b ) .",
    "* @xmath163 decay : * + if neutrinos are of majorana nature , neutrinoless double - beta decay proceeds via the effective majorana neutrino mass ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for other mechanisms ) @xmath182 holds @xcite , where @xmath183 is the mixing angle relevant for solar neutrino oscillations .",
    "note that from the range ( [ range ] ) it follows that @xmath184 thus , at least the upper bound in eq.([mbound ] ) is in the reach of present experiments @xcite . at present a very stringent bound exists from the @xmath185ge experiment @xcite with @xmath186 ev ( see also the references cited in ref .",
    "note that for the small mixing angle msw solution of the solar neutrino puzzle , which is favoured by bbn , one has @xmath187",
    "in this report we have discussed the possible form of the neutrino mass spectrum that can be inferred from the results of all neutrino oscillation experiments , including solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments .",
    "the crucial input are the three indications in favour of neutrino oscillations given by the solar neutrino data , the atmospheric neutrino anomaly and the result of the lsnd experiment , and also the negative results of the sbl disappearance experiments .",
    "these indications , which all pertain to different scales of neutrino mass - squared differences , require that apart from the three well - know neutrino flavours at least one additional sterile neutrino ( without couplings to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bosons ) must exist . in our investigation",
    "we have assumed that there is one sterile neutrino and that the 4-neutrino mixing matrix ( [ mixing ] ) is unitary .",
    "we have considered all possible schemes with four massive neutrinos which provide three scales of @xmath188 ( see fig .",
    "[ 4spectra ] ) .",
    "the main points of our discussion can be summarized as follows :    * the data prefer the non - hierarchical mass spectra ( a ) and ( b ) ( see fig .",
    "[ 4spectra ] and eq.([ab ] ) ) with two pairs of close masses separated by a mass difference of the order of 1 ev necessary for a description of the lsnd result . in scheme ( a )",
    ", the quantity @xmath189 is small and @xmath190 is close to 1 , and vice versa in scheme ( b ) . *",
    "the solar neutrino problem is preferably solved by @xmath191 and the atmospheric neutrino anomaly by @xmath192 transitions .",
    "if the effective number @xmath144 of neutrinos relevant in bbn is smaller than 4 , then standard bbn leads to small mixing angle msw @xmath161 transitions as the solution of the solar neutrino problem and to @xmath193 transitions in atmospheric neutrinos . * again with @xmath146 , @xmath193 transitions are strongly suppressed in sbl neutrino oscillations .",
    "note that in the case of @xmath146 all sbl neutrino oscillations are small or suppressed . * in lbl neutrino oscillations",
    ", it follows from schemes ( a ) and ( b ) that the transitions @xmath194 and @xmath195 are suppressed .",
    "* schemes ( a ) and ( b ) could in principle be distinguished in @xmath0h and @xmath163 decays , because in scheme ( a ) neutrino mass effects are expected , whereas in scheme ( b ) such effects are suppressed . note that in scheme ( a ) with the small mixing angle msw solution of the solar neutrino problem , which is preferred by standard bbn ( see section [ bbn ] ) , one gets @xmath196 ev for the effective majorana mass relevant in @xmath163 decay ( see eqs.([mbound ] ) and ( [ sqrtrange ] ) ) .",
    "such a large value for @xmath197 should be close to discovery .",
    "finally , we want to remark that the most crucial input in our discussion is the result of the lsnd experiment .",
    "this result will be checked by the approved miniboone experiment , which will begin data taking in 2001 @xcite .",
    "the sno experiment , which is expected to announce the first results in 2000 , will test the hypothesis of oscillations of solar neutrinos into sterile neutrinos @xcite .",
    "it could thus deliver a very important further piece of evidence in favour of the sterile neutrino and thus indirectly also check the bbn constraint on the 4-neutrino mixing matrix .",
