    "semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) embedded in a photonic crystal ( pc ) cavity provides a promising system to investigate cavity quantum electrodynamics and quantum information processing ( qip ) in the solid state @xcite . in the past decade , it has attracted considerable experimental and theoretical attention .",
    "both the weak and strong couplings have been achieved in experiment @xcite .",
    "however , the practical and useful qip requires a large number of qubits , and it is difficult to achieve so many spatial separation qds in a pc cavity experimentally @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "experiments have proved that the above system also can be used to harvest single photons by coupling a single qd to an enhanced cavity mode@xcite . nevertheless , since generated single photons",
    "must be coupled out of the cavity , the overall efficiency of this kind of single - photon source is nt high enough . in order to overcome this challenge , hughes _ et al .",
    "_ presented several theory proposals based on pc waveguides @xcite .",
    "these schemes show single qds also can coupled a pc waveguides efficiently . and",
    "it has been proved in experiment by lund - hansen _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "very recently , feng _ et al .",
    "_ proposed a scheme to realize a quantum computation with atoms in decoherence - free subspace by using a dispersive atom - cavity interaction driven by strong classical laser fields @xcite .",
    "but their proposal is based on identical qubits , and each qubit is driven with four laser fields . motivated by these works",
    ", we present a scheme for realizing the scalable quantum computation based on nonidentical qds trapped in a single - mode pc waveguide . in this scheme",
    ", any two qds can acquire different phases conditional upon their different states and corresponding detunings between the waveguide mode and external light fields . and",
    "selective gate operations for any two qds can be acquire in this way .",
    "for this reason , this scheme also can be employed to achieve graph states , @xmath0-qubit controlled phase @xmath1 gate ( ncz gate ) , and cluster states with different number of gate operations . during the gate operation , neither the qds nor the waveguide is excited . comparing with ref .",
    "@xcite , the logical gate is extended to nonidentical qubits , and the number of laser fields is decreased .",
    "in addition , this scheme is the first scheme to realize the scalable quantum computation with spatially separated and nonidentical qds .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec.[seck ] , we introduce the theoretical model and effective hamiltonian . in sec.[sec31 ] , we present how to realize the selective quantum phase gate between any two qds . in sec.[sec4 ] , we give the operations to achieve the graph states , ncz gate , and cluster state . in sec.[sec5 ] , we show the simulation and realizability of the above gate operations and entangled states . the conclusion is given in sec.[sec6 ] .",
    "let us consider that @xmath0 charged and spatially separated gaas / algaas qds are trapped in a single - mode waveguide .",
    "each dot has two lower states @xmath2 , @xmath3 and a higher state @xmath4 , here ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) and ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) denote the spin up and spin down for electron and hole , respectively . the transitions @xmath9  and @xmath10 are correspondingly coupled to the vertical polarization and horizontal polarization lights @xcite . with the choice of the fields with the vertical polarization , the state @xmath11 can be treated as an auxiliary state , while the transition @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 can coupled to the waveguide mode and classical laser fields .",
    "in this situation , the hamiltonian describing the interaction between qds and fields can be written as :    @xmath15    where@xmath16 is the coupling constant between qd @xmath17 and the waveguide mode with the detuning @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the annihilation operator for the waveguide mode , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the rabi frequencies driven by the laser fields with the detunings @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , and @xmath24 ( see fig.1 ) .        in order to derive the effective hamiltonian of the system",
    ", we will use the method proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite under the following conditions : ( 1 ) @xmath25 ; ( 2 ) @xmath26 ; ( 3 ) the large detuning condition : @xmath27 ; ( 4 ) @xmath28 .",
    "the first condition together with the second condition can cancel the stark shifts and related terms completely . under the large detuning condition , the probability for qds absorbing photons from the light fields or being excited is negligible .",
    "the last condition ensures that @xmath29 is only related with detuning between the waveguide field and light fields .",
    "in this situation , if the qds are initial in the ground states , the excited states will not be populated and can be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "thus we can obtain the effective hamiltonian :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 .",
    "the first term describes a stark shift caused by the waveguide mode , the last two terms shows the indirect coupling between laser fields and waveguide field , which is caused by the virtually excited qds .    under the condition @xmath32",
    ", the waveguide mode can not exchange energy with the classical fields , the photon in the waveguide is only virtually excited , and any two qds can interfere with each other .",
    "so the effective hamiltonian takes the form :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 . with the initial state for the waveguide mode being in the vacuum state assumed",
    ", the effective hamiltonian reduces to    @xmath36    this equation can be understood as follows . under the condition of @xmath37 , with the laser field acting",
    ", qds will take place the stark shifts and acquire the virtual excitation , and this virtual excitation will induce the coupling between the vacuum waveguide mode and classical fields . as the stark shifts are nonlinear in the number of any two qds in the state @xmath12 , the subsystem composed by arbitrary two qds can acquire a phase conditional upon the number of these two qds in the state @xmath12 . on the contrary ,",
    "in the case of @xmath38 , there might be not additional phase for the two qds in the state @xmath12 . as a result",
    ", this system can be employed to construct the selective controlled phase gate .",
    "now , we take qds @xmath39 and @xmath40 as an example to discuss how to construct the selective quantum controlled phase gates with arbitrary two qds . in order to do so , states @xmath11 and @xmath12 are used to store the quantum information at first . in the case of @xmath41 , by using the appropriate light fields for qds @xmath39 and @xmath40 , we can get @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "then , the effective hamiltonian ( [ eq302 ] ) takes the form of@xmath44here , @xmath45 .",
    "after that , according to the hamiltonian ( [ eq411 ] ) for the same detuning , the evolutions of the logical states are :    @xmath46 , the above equation can be rewritten aslatexmath:[\\[\\left\\ { \\begin{array}{rcl }",
    "transformation for qds @xmath39 and @xmath40 corresponds to the quantum phase gate operation , in which if and only if both controlling and controlled qubits are in the states @xmath12 , there will be an additional phase in the system . during the operation ,",
    "none of qds and waveguide modes is excited .",
    "it is worth to point out that , although qds are nonidentical , @xmath48 is a tunable constant , which is decided by the frequency of detuning between the laser field and waveguide mode .",
    "therefore , this system can construct the controlled phase gate with different qds .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of @xmath49 , with the choice of appropriate light fields for qds @xmath39 and @xmath40 , we can get @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 . so the effective hamiltonian ( [ eq302 ] ) takes the form:@xmath54and the time evolutions of four logical states for the two qds @xmath39 and @xmath40 , under the hamiltonian ( [ eq412 ] ) for the different detunings , are given by :    @xmath55 , there is@xmath56 for @xmath57 , there will be no the controlled phase gate operation for the qds @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    as a result , with the choice of @xmath58 , this system can realize the several selective controlled phase @xmath59 gate ( scz gate ) operations for the different qds with different detuning at the same time .",
    "here , we show how to acquire graph states , ncz gate , and cluster states in the system . at first",
    ", we will review the definition of an n - qubit graph state in brief . in a system of @xmath0 qubits , if each qubit is in the state @xmath60 , and to all pairs @xmath61 of qubits joined by a controlled phase @xmath1 gate ( @xmath62 gate ) ,",
    "these @xmath0 qubits are in the graph state @xcite , which can be expressed as    @xmath63 qds are in the initial state @xmath64 , they are trapped in a single - mode waveguide , and simultaneously driven by the appropriate laser fields . the transition @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 is initial far off resonant with the fields , and all the detunings between the single - mode waveguide and laser fields are the same",
    ". if the waveguide mode is initial in the vacuum state , the state evolution for any two qds is governed by eq.([eq002 ] ) .",
    "waiting for a controlled phase @xmath1 gate operation time , a graph state for @xmath65 qds can be created . after the above graph state is generated , with the implement of controlled phase @xmath1 gate operations for @xmath0 of these @xmath65 qds again , a ncz gate can be constructed .",
    "the process of generating the graph state and ncz gate can refer the figures in ref . @xcite .",
    "in addition , as the selective controlled phase @xmath1  gate can be realized in several different groups at the same time , with the choice of @xmath66 and @xmath67 for group @xmath68 , several different graph states or ncz gates can be achieved simultaneously .",
    "as it is well known , cluster states can be acquired by the local unitary operation from graph states . if each dot is initial in the state @xmath69 and encoded with abababab ...",
    ", a 1d cluster state can be realized by two steps ( see fig.[cacb]-(a ) ) .",
    "first step : apply the scz gate operations for a and b ; second step : apply the scz gate operations for b and a. after that , a 1d cluster state is achieved .",
    "the operations for constructing the 2d cluster states are listed as follows ( see fig.[cacb]-(b ) ) .",
    "i ) name dots with abcdabcdabcd ... ; ii ) with the application of scz gate operations for a and b , c and d , successively , several 1d cluster states are generated ; iii ) after applying the scz gate operations for a and c , b and d , respectively , a 2d cluster state is created .",
    "in the following , let us discuss the realizability of the experiment . according to the above discussion",
    ", the influences of spontaneous emission from the excited states and the waveguide decay can be ignored . as a matter of fact , under the condition of the largely detuned couplings the excited state is rarely populated , so the influence of the spontaneous emission can be neglected , and the main decoherence effect in our scheme is due to waveguide decay .",
    "then , the master equation can be given as follows : @xmath70+\\frac{\\gamma } { 2}(2a\\rho a^{+}-a^{+}a\\rho -\\rho a^{+}a)\\end{array } \\label{eq02221}\\]]where @xmath71 is the waveguide decay rate , and @xmath72 is the decay time of the waveguide mode . and the fidelity of the entangled states and gate operations can be expressed as @xmath73 with @xmath74 being the density operator of the system in the case with ( without ) waveguide decay . according to experimentally achievable parameters in the system of qds embedded in a single - mode waveguide @xcite ,",
    "the coupling of qds and waveguide is about @xmath75 , the decay time for waveguide is @xmath76 . with the choices of the coupling constants and detunings as fig.[fig1 ] , which apparently satisfy the approximation conditions mentioned above",
    ", we can get @xmath77 . the performance of the any two qds @xmath78 and @xmath79 controlled phase @xmath59 gate ( cz@xmath80 gate ) operations versus the waveguide decay time @xmath81 , and the fidelities of the entangled states and ncz gate operations versus the number of qubits are given in fig .

    "it means that the waveguide decay affects the fidelity of the gate operation largely @xcite .",
    "and the fidelity is 0.9877 for @xmath94 .",
    "moreover , in this case the gate operation time is about @xmath95 , comparing with effective decay time of waveguide @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) , it is possible to perform hundreds two - qubit controlled phase @xmath1 gates within the effective decay time .",

    "the distinct advantages of the proposed scheme are as follows : firstly , this system is scalable and controllable ; secondly , there is no waveguide photon population involved and the qds are almost in their ground states ; thirdly , as the qds are non - identical , it is more practical",
