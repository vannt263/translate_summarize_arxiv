    "device scaling has been the engine driving the microelectronics revolution as predicted by moore s law.@xcite by reducing the size of transistors , processors become faster and more power efficient at an exponential rate . currently the main challenge in device",
    "scaling is the integration of high - k oxides as gate oxides into silicon technology .",
    "the gate oxide is an integral part of a metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect transistor ( mosfet ) .",
    "it is the dielectric of a capacitor , which is used to attract charge carriers into the channel between source and drain , and thus switches the transistor between its conducting and its non - conducting state . with a thickness of approximately 1 - 2 nm,@xcite",
    "the gate oxide is the smallest structure of a transistor .",
    "further scaling would result in an unacceptably high quantum mechanical leakage current and thus a large power consumption .",
    "in current transistors , the gate oxide is made from sio@xmath6 and sio@xmath7n@xmath8 .",
    "future transistor generations will have to employ oxides with a higher dielectric constant ( high - k ) .",
    "this allows greater physical thicknesses and thus reduces the quantum mechanical leakage currents .",
    "the main contenders for the replacement of sio@xmath6 in future transistors are , from today s point of view , oxides containing alkaline earth metals like sr or ba , third - row elements like y or la , forth - row elements like ti , zr and hf , or mixtures thereof .",
    "prominent examples are perovskite structures around srtio@xmath9@xcite and laalo@xmath9@xcite , fluorite structures like zro@xmath6 and hfo@xmath6@xcite and also y@xmath6o@xmath9 and la@xmath6o@xmath9@xcite or pyrochlore structures like la@xmath6hf@xmath6o@xmath10@xcite and la@xmath6zr@xmath6o@xmath10.@xcite recently , also promising results on pr@xmath6o@xmath9 have been published.@xcite    while the first high - k - oxides will be grown with an interfacial sio@xmath6 layer , a further reduction in scale requires high - k - oxides with a direct interface to silicon . the requirement to limit interface states , and the often crystalline nature of the oxides demand an epitaxial growth of the oxides on silicon .",
    "considering layer - by - layer growth by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) , the first growth step for high - k oxides is the deposition of the metal on silicon .",
    "therefore we have investigated deposition of metals out of the three most relevant classes for high - k oxides on si(001 ) .",
    "these are the divalent alkaline - earth metals and the three- and the four - valent transition metals .",
    "the results on adsorption of zr and sr have been published previously.@xcite the present paper completes the study with a description of la - adsorption on si(001 ) as example of a trivalent metal .    our previous work has shown that zr tends to form silicides readily.@xcite silicide grains have been observed after zr sputtering on si(001),@xcite unless silicide formation is suppressed by early oxidation which , however , leads to interfacial sio@xmath6 .",
    "the sr silicides are less stable in contact with silicon and due to their sizable mismatch in lattice constant , nucleation does not proceed easily .",
    "the alkaline - earth metals sr and ba have been used in the first demonstration of an atomically defined interface between a high - k oxide , namely srtio@xmath9 and silicon.@xcite by following through the detailed steps of the formation of this interface , starting at the low - coverage structures of metal adsorption , we were able to provide a new picture for the phase diagram of sr on si(001).@xcite the phase diagram has been important to link the theoretical interface structure of srtio@xmath9 on si(001 ) to the experimental growth process.@xcite from the interface structure and its chemistry we could show in turn that the band - offset , a critical parameter for a transistor , can be engineered to match technological requirements by carefully controlling the oxidation of the interface.@xcite    since many of the characteristics of sr adsorption carry over to la - adsorption let us briefly summarize the main results.@xcite sr donates its electrons to the empty dangling bonds of the si - surface .",
    "the si - dimers receive electron pairs one - by - one , and unbuckle as they become charged .",
    "when all si dangling bonds are filled , i.e. beyond @xmath11  monolayer ( ml ) , additional electrons enter the anti - bonding states of the si - dimers at the surface , and thus break up the si - dimer - row reconstruction .    at low coverage , sr forms chains running at an angle of 63@xmath12 to the si - dimer rows . as the coverage increases , the chains condense first into structures at @xmath13  ml and at @xmath14  ml , which are determined by the buckling of the si - dimers and their electrostatic interaction with the positive sr ions . at @xmath11  ml a chemically fairly inert layer forms , where all dangling bonds are filled and all ideal adsorption sites in the valley between the si - dimer rows are occupied .",
    "the paper is organized similar to our previous work on sr adsorption . in sec .",

    "[ sec : phasediagram ] where we propose a phase diagram for la on the surface .",

    "the frozen core states were imported from the isolated atom .",
    "for the silicon atoms we used a set with two projector functions per angular momentum for @xmath15 and @xmath16-character and one projector per angular momentum with @xmath4-character .",
    "the hydrogen atoms saturating the back surface had only one @xmath15-type projector function .",
    "for lanthanum we treated the 5@xmath15 and 5@xmath16 core shells as valence electrons .",
    "we used two projector functions per magnetic quantum number for the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath5 angular momentum channels and one for the @xmath4 channel .",
    "the augmentation charge density has been expanded in spherical harmonics up to @xmath17 .",
    "the kinetic energy cutoff for the plane wave part of the wave functions was set to 30  ry and that for the electron density to 60  ry .",
    "a slab of five silicon layers was used as silicon substrate .",
    "this thickness was found to be sufficient in previous studies on sr adsorption.@xcite the dangling bonds of the unreconstructed back surface of the slab have been saturated by hydrogen atoms .",
    "the lateral lattice constant was chosen as the experimental lattice constant @xmath18  of silicon,@xcite which is 1  % smaller than the theoretical lattice constant .",
    "since we always report energies of adsorbate structures relative to the energy of a slab of the clean silicon surface , the lateral strain due to the use of the experimental lattice constant cancels out .",
    "the slabs repeat every 16  perpendicular to the surface , which results in a vacuum region of 9.5    for the clean silicon surface .",
    "the car - parrinello ab - initio molecular dynamics@xcite scheme with damped motion was used to optimize the electronic and atomic structures .",
    "all structures were fully relaxed without symmetry constraints .",
    "the atomic positions of the backplane of the slab and the terminating hydrogen atoms were frozen .",
    "many of the adsorption structures are metallic , which requires a sufficiently fine grid in k - space .",
    "we used an equivalent to twelve by twelve points per @xmath19 surface unit cell .",
    "previous studies have shown that a mesh of eight by eight k - points is sufficient.@xcite we have chosen a higher density here as this allows us to use commensurate k - meshes for @xmath20 and @xmath21 surface reconstructions .    for metallic systems ,",
    "the orbital occupations were determined using the mermin functional,@xcite which produces a fermi - distribution for the electrons in its ground state .",
    "the electron temperature was set to 1000  k. in our case this temperature should not be considered as a physical temperature but rather as a broadening scheme for the states obtained with a discrete set of k - points .",

    "three of them are partners of filled si - dimers while one is a buckled si - dimer with the negative si atom pointing towards the la ad - atom . on the basis of counting unbuckled si - dimers , these structures are in a 3 + oxidation state .",
    "the la - chain is the configuration with lowest energy in the low coverage limit .",
    "the lowest energy chain structures are of the order of 0.17  ev per la atom more stable than the most favorable isolated la - dimer . at elevated temperatures",
    ", entropic effects will lead to increasingly shorter chain fragments . from the energy - difference of the linear chain and the isolated la - dimer",
    ", we obtain an estimate for the chain termination energy of approximately 0.09  ev .",
    "it should be noted , that experiments often observe shorter chain sequences than predicted from thermal equilibrium as high - temperature structures are frozen in .",
    "the electronic structure of the la - chain is analogous to that of the sr single chain.@xcite the empty silicon surface has an occupied and an un - occupied band formed from the dangling bonds of the si - dimers .",
    "la donates electrons into the upper dangling bond band .",
    "those dangling bond states , which become filled , are shifted down in energy due to the change in hybridization on the one side and due to the proximity of the positive la - cations on the other side .",
    "with increasing coverage , the chains become closer packed . in the case of sr",
    ", there was a preference for a periodicity of @xmath34 surface lattice spacings along the si - dimer row direction.@xcite this restriction has been attributed to the requirement that every cation be surrounded by four si - atoms with filled dangling bonds , and that there is no frustration of the si - dimer buckling , i.e. adjacent si - dimers are buckled antiparallel .    for la the situation is more complex . due to the longer periodicity of the la chains compared to those of sr , there are two families of chain packing for la as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lacondchain ] . in the first family",
    "the la chains are displaced only parallel to the si - dimer row direction . in the second family",
    "the chains are in addition displaced perpendicular to the si - dimer row .",
    "the first family has a preference of @xmath34 surface lattice spacings along the dimer row as in the case of sr adsorption .",
    "the spacing in the second family is arbitrary .",
    "the reason is that in family one , the buckling of every second si - dimer row is pinned on both sides by two neighboring la chains ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lacondchain]a ) . a si - dimer is pinned , if its buckling is determined by the coulomb attraction of its raised , and thus negatively charged , si atom to a nearby la ion . since the buckling alternates along the si - dimer row",
    ", this pinning can lead to indirect , long - ranged interaction between different la - chains .    in the second family the buckling of every si - dimer row",
    "is pinned only at one la - chain as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lacondchain]b , while there is no preference of the si - dimer buckling at the other la - chain .",
    "thus for la we find  in contrast to sr@xcite  arbitrary chain spacings .",
    "the closest packing of la - chains before they merge is 1/5  ml .",
    "we consider two la - chains merged if la atoms of different la chains occupy nearest - neighbor @xmath35 sites within one valley .",
    "we predict a distinct phase at this coverage as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] and discussed later .",
    "this structure , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lacondchain]b , is derived from chains of the second family .",
    "an explanation for finding a phase at 1/5  ml is that the energy at higher coverage increases due to the electrostatic interaction of the la atoms within one valley .",
    "for the first family , the highest possible coverage before la - chains merge is 1/6  ml ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lacondchain]a ) .",
    "note that the chains can change their direction without appreciable energy cost as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lachain]b .",
    "experimentally measured diffraction patterns would reflect a configurational average .",
    "the layer resolved density of states is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5th_dos ] .",
    "we see that the fermi - level lies in a band gap of the surface . above the fermi - level and",
    "still in the band - gap of bulk si , surface bands are formed , which originate from the remaining empty dangling bonds of the buckled si - dimers . as in the case of sr , these states form flat bands in the band - gap of silicon , which approximately remain at their energetic position as the la coverage is increased .",
    "its density of states , however , scales with the number of empty dangling bonds .",
    "if the spacing of the chains is further reduced , they condense at 1/3 ml to the structure shown in fig .  [ fig : thirdml ] .",
    "there are several versions of this structure type .",
    "they have a repeating sequence of two la - atoms and one vacant @xmath35 site in each valley in common .",
    "the relative displacement of this sequence from one valley to the next , however , may differ .",
    "we investigated several structures and found the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thirdml ] to be the most stable .",

    "this surface is isoelectronic to the sr covered surface at 1/2  ml.@xcite for the sr - covered silicon surface , the increased oxidation resistance of the corresponding 1/2 ml structure has been observed experimentally.@xcite similarly we suggest that the surface covered with 1/3  ml of la will have an increased oxidation resistance .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3rd_dos ] we show the layer - resolved density of states of the most stable structure at 1/3  ml",
    ". in analogy to the 1/2  ml covered sr surface , there are no surface states deep in the band gap of silicon , because all si - dimer dangling bonds are filled and shifted into the valence band due to the electrostatic attraction of the electrons to the positive la ions .",
    "note , however , that in contrast to the canonical surface coverage of sr on si(001 ) at a coverage of 1/2  ml , the canonical la surface exhibits vacant @xmath35-sites .     for a discussion about the si band gap .",
    "this dos corresponds to the supercell outlined in fig .",
    "[ fig : thirdml].,width=302 ]",
    "up to the canonical coverage of 1/3  ml , all thermodynamically stable reconstructions could be explained by la being in the @xmath36 oxidation state .",
    "in contrast to the isolated la - atoms and la - dimers , the oxidation state can clearly be identified from the number of unbuckled si - dimers : each unbuckled dimer has received two electrons .",
    "a @xmath36 oxidation state is also consistent with the density of states .",
    "if we follow the picture that emerged from sr , we would anticipate that increasing the coverage above 1/3  ml in case of la would lead to filling the si - dimer antibonds , which results in a breaking up of the dimer bonds .",
    "for la the situation is different : the la-@xmath4 band is located at much lower energies as compared to sr .",
    "therefore the energy to break the si - dimer bonds is larger than that to add electrons into the la @xmath4-shell . as a result",
    "we find that la changes its oxidation state from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "oxidation states of la that are even lower are unfavorable due to the coulomb repulsion of electrons within the la-@xmath4 and @xmath5 shells .",
    "thus the structures above 1/3  ml can be explained in terms of la@xmath3 ions and are similar to those found for sr.@xcite    it may be instructive to compare two structures with different oxidation states of la .",
    "a good example is found at a coverage of 2/3  ml : the lowest energy structure is a @xmath38 reconstruction already found for sr@xcite and depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2_3rds]a .",
    "this is a clear 2 + structure .",
    "since every si - dimer only accepts two electrons , they can just accommodate two of the three valence electrons of la . the lowest structure with formal la@xmath2 ions , which can clearly be identified as having all si - dimer bonds broken ,",

    "[ fig : crossover ] using a set of surface reconstructions , for which the charge state can be determined unambiguously .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the 2 + structures become significantly more stable above 1/2  ml . from fig .",
    "[ fig : enevscov ] it is apparent that the energy rises sharply as the la atoms cross over to the 2 + oxidation state beyond the canonical interface at a coverage of 1/3  ml .",

    "the slope of the line - segments of the lower envelope in fig .  [ fig : enevscov ] corresponds to the chemical potential , at which the two neighboring phases coexist ( for a more elaborate discussion , refer to ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the stable phases are defined by the coverages where two line segments with different slopes meet .",
    "the zero for the la chemical potential has been chosen as the value at which lasi@xmath6 and silicon coexist .",
