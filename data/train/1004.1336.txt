    "energy transport from the solar photosphere towards the corona , which eventually may lead to coronal heating , is still an open problem .",

    "the energy transport by the waves has been recently observed through the oscillatory motions of plasma in the chromosphere @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the dynamic photosphere may excite pulses due to convective shootings and/or magnetic reconnections , which then may propagate upwards .",
    "several kinds of impulsive events are frequently observed on the solar disc : chromospheric bright grains @xcite , blinkers @xcite and explosive events @xcite .",
    "recent observations by hinode spacecraft revealed various types of energetic events such as chromospheric jet - like structures @xcite and type ii spicules @xcite .",
    "however , direct observational evidence of pulse propagation at the solar limb from the photosphere upwards , to our knowledge , was not reported yet .    upward propagating pressure pulses",
    "may quickly steepen into shocks due to the rapid decrease of density . however , if the pulses propagate along magnetic flux tubes , then tube dispersive effects may prevent the nonlinear steepening .",
    "this may lead to the formation of a soliton , which is a stable structure propagating without significant change of shape .",
    "the formation of sausage solitons in magnetic tubes first has been suggested by @xcite . since that , numerous papers addressed the soliton formation problem @xcite .",
    "most of the studies consider a sausage soliton ( @xmath1 mode in magnetic tubes ) , but no observational support to the theory was reported yet . on the other hand , some observations suggest the propagation of nonlinear soliton - like kink waves ( @xmath2 mode in tubes ) identified with moving magnetic features around sunspots @xcite .    here",
    "we report the upward propagation of a pressure blob in time series of ca ii h line obtained by hinode / sot @xcite .",
    "estimated parameters of the blob fit with a solution of slow sausage soliton propagating along a magnetic tube .",
    "therefore , we suggest that this is the first observational evidence of sausage soliton propagation in the lower solar atmosphere .    , therefore the @xmath3-axis corresponds to the solar-@xmath4 and the @xmath5-axis corresponds to the solar-@xmath6 .",

    "the exposure time for each image is 0.512 s. the integration time for each step of time series is uniform and equal to 4.8 s.    we start with the raw ( zero level ) data , then use the standard sot subroutines for calibration .",

    "( the arrow shows the place of the blob propagation ) .",
    "2 shows 8 consecutive images of the sequence ( left to right and top to bottom ) .",
    "the time interval between consecutive images is @xmath7 5 s. the blob is located at @xmath7 500 - 600 km above the surface ( see the upper left panel of fig .",
    "2 ) at the moment of 06:19:01 u.t . , then it gradually propagates upwards .",
    "the blob is displaced at @xmath7 1200 km distance during 35 s , therefore mean apparent propagation speed is @xmath7 35 km s@xmath0 .",
    "in the image , the blob propagates with @xmath8 angle about the vertical .",
    "the propagation angle seems larger on fig . 2 , but this is due to the limb inclination ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the blob may propagate also with some angle about the projected plane , then the real propagation speed can be higher . for an estimate",
    ", we may suppose the same angle of propagation , i.e. @xmath8 , which gives the real propagation speed as @xmath9 km s@xmath0 .",
    "the ratio between the blob and background intensities is @xmath7 1.4 .",
    "therefore , the relative amplitude of the density enhancement is @xmath7 0.2 .",
    "the amplitude of the blob is strong enough and indicates to its nonlinear character .",
    "the strong amplitude of pulse density excludes the possibility of kink or alfvnic pulse .",
    "therefore , it should be a pressure pulse , which in magnetic tubes transforms into a sausage pulse .",
    "the ratio of blob length to width can be roughly estimated .",
    "3 ( upper panel ) shows the ratio as a function of time . in the first 4 images ( between 0 and 15 s , which corresponds to the location of the blob at lower heights ) the ratio is approximately 3.5 and",
    "later it gradually reduces to @xmath7 2 , which gives @xmath7 3 in average .",
    "the propagation speed of intensity blob is much higher comparing to the local sound speed .",
    "therefore , it can not be a simple slow sausage pulse .",
    "one may compare the blob properties to new features observed by hinode ; such as chromospheric jet - like structures @xcite and type ii spicules @xcite .",
    "the observed jets have different properties inside and outside sunspots .",
    "the chromospheric jets observed in penumbral chromosphere have length of 1 - 4 mm , width of 400 km and apparent rise velocity of @xmath10 100 km s@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the anemone jets observed outside sunspots are 2 - 5 mm length , 150 - 300 km width and have apparent velocity of 10 - 20 km s@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the type ii spicules have life time of 10 - 150 s , apparent upward velocity of 50 - 150 km s@xmath0 and width of 200 km @xcite .",
    "they are tallest reaching 5000 km or more in coronal holes , while in quiet sun regions they reach lengths of several mm .",
    "the length and apparent speed of our intensity blob do not coincide to neither of these features ; it is shorter than the observed jets , has different upward speed and propagates as a pulse - like structure , not a jet .",
    "therefore , we argue that the blob represents either a fast sausage pulse or slow sausage soliton .",
    "fast sausage pulse may propagate much faster than the local sound speed for relatively larger external alfvn speed @xcite . however , fast sausage waves are leaky for the long wave - length limit .",
    "suppose , that the radius of the tube where the fast sausage pulse ( or wave trains ) propagates is @xmath11 , then we get @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the characteristic length of the pulse ( here @xmath14 parameter is taken from observed length to width ratio of the blob ) .",
    "the fast sausage waves are leaky for this value of @xmath15 ( see fig . 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the pulse should vanish rapidly before it could propagate upwards .        on the other hand , the observed blob propagates without significant change of relative amplitude and the form ( at least in the first 5 images ) , which may rule out the possibility of fast sausage pulse .",
    "the blob changes its shape in the last 3 images becoming wider , however length to width ratio and relative amplitude remain more or less similar .",
    "the blob width is @xmath7 136 km at the lowest height and increases up to @xmath7 516 km at the highest height ( fig .",
    "3 , lower panel ) .",
    "the observed broadening may reflect the magnetic tube expansion with height ( we will discuss it later ) .",
    "another scenario of the intensity blob propagation is a slow sausage soliton , which is formed when non - linear steepening due to large amplitude is balanced by wave dispersion .",
    "the soliton propagates without significant changing of form and faster than the tube speed .",
    "the soliton solution should satisfy the parameters , which can be tested from observational properties of the pressure blob .",
    "the soliton solution in structured magnetic field is well - studied @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is no need to go for detailed calculation of the parameters ; we just use known theoretical properties of slow sausage soliton and then compare them with observations .",
    "a slow sausage soliton can be either surface or body solution depending on its structure inside the tube @xcite .",
    "the quasi - homogeneous structure of observed blob suggests more surface than body soliton .",
    "therefore , here we consider the slow surface sausage soliton , however the body solution can be also tested in the future .",
    "theoretical properties of sausage soliton are more easily obtained for magnetic slabs rather than tubes .",
    "numerical simulations of solitary waves in magnetic tubes @xcite show the same properties of slow soliton as derived by analytical calculations for a magnetic slab @xcite .",
    "therefore , we consider a magnetic slab of width @xmath16 embedded in a magnetized environment . let s suppose that the magnetic field inside ( outside ) the slab is @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , the density inside ( outside ) is @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) and the plasma pressure inside ( outside ) is @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the pressure balance condition at the slab boundaries is @xmath23 .",
    "the characteristic wave speeds inside ( outside ) the slab are : the alfvn speed @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , the sound speed @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and the tube speed @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) . an important parameter of wave propagation in magnetic slabs is @xmath30}}}$ ] , which plays the role of perpendicular wave number outside the slab . the waves may propagate in the slab only when @xmath31 ( they are leaky if @xmath32 )",
    ".    the solution of slow sausage surface soliton in magnetic slabs can be given by the following expression @xcite :    @xmath33 ^ 2}},\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 is the displacement of the slab boundary , @xmath11 is the maximal value of the displacement @xmath34 ( i.e. the soliton amplitude ) and @xmath35 are the soliton speed and the spatial scale respectively .",

    "2}{\\rho_{e0}\\over \\rho_0}{{c_tc^2_s(c^2_t -v^2_{ae})}\\over { m_ev^2_a(c^2_s + v^2_a)}}.\\ ] ]    let us check if the observed parameters of intensity blob satisfy the requirements of sausage soliton .",
    "the observed blob propagates in the chromosphere , where the sound speed can be taken as @xmath39=10 km s@xmath0 .",
    "we assume the density ratio outside and inside the slab as @xmath40=0.9 .",
    "then , the propagation speed of the soliton , @xmath41 , is determined by the soliton relative amplitude , @xmath42 , and the alfvn speed @xmath43 ( see eq .",
    "the observed relative amplitude of the blob is estimated as @xmath42=0.2 , then the alfvn speed stays as a free parameter . in order to obtain the observed apparent propagation speed i.e. 35 km s@xmath0",
    ", the alfvn speed needs to be @xmath44 km s@xmath0 .",
    "another important parameter of the sausage soliton is its length to width ratio .",
    "observations show that the blob has elongated form ; its mean length is approximately 3 times larger than width .",
    "then the parameter associated to the soliton length is @xmath45 .",
    "this will be achieved when @xmath46 , which in turn requires @xmath47 or @xmath48 ( as the alfvn speed is much higher than the sound speed ) .",
    "thus , the soliton may have the observed elongated shape if electron temperature inside and outside the tube is approximately similar .",
    "brief conclusion of the previous section is that the observed intensity blob may represent a slow sausage soliton in chromospheric magnetic tube , which has the alfvn speed of @xmath44 km s@xmath0 and the temperature balance with surroundings .",
    "note , that the both requirements are quite typical to the chromosphere .",
    "possible inclination of the tube along the line of sight may cause additional correction to the estimated alfvn speed . @xmath49 inclination leads to the blob propagation speed of @xmath9 km s@xmath0 , which then cause the slight increase of required alfvn speed .",
    "it is interesting to note that the blob form remains almost unchanged in the first 4 images of fig .",
    "2 . however , in the last four images the width of the blob is significantly increased .",
    "3 ( lower panel ) shows the variation of the blob width with time .",
    "the gradual increase of the blob width probably is due to the expansion of the magnetic tube with height due to the stratification of the solar atmosphere . in thin flux tube approximation ,",
    "magnetic field strength varies as @xmath50 in the simplest case of isothermal atmosphere , where @xmath51 is the scale height .",
    "conservation of magnetic flux yields @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the tube cross section .",
    "then , the dependence of the tube diameter on height should be as @xmath54 .",
    "this dependence can be used up to 1200 km , where the thin flux tube approximation is valid @xcite .",
    "the scale height of @xmath7 220 km ( estimated for the sound speed of 10 km s@xmath0 ) yields an increase of the tube diameter by @xmath55 times between 500 and 1200 km heights .",
    "the observed width at 500 km and 1200 km is 136 and 300 km respectively .",
    "the ratio between the two parameters gives exactly suggested value .",
    "thus , the blob propagates along the magnetic tube , which is expended upwards as modeled by the stratified atmosphere .",
    "the rapid broadening of the blob in last images ( i.e. higher heights ) may correspond to the rapid increase of the tube cross - section ( see fig . 1 in hasan et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the blob begins to disappear after the height of @xmath7 1700 km probably due to the changed conditions for soliton formation . due to the mathematical difficulties , all known",
    "theoretical properties of slow surface sausage soliton were calculated for the magnetic tubes with constant cross section .",
    "therefore , it is unclear what happens when the soliton propagates along the tubes with varying cross section .",
    "intuitively , one may suppose that the soliton parameters also slowly vary during the propagation .",
    "it also should be mentioned that the soliton solution , which we use to model the blob propagation , was obtained without taking into account the stratification , which is important in this part of solar atmosphere .",
    "these problems need further detailed study in theoretically and numerically .    the length and apparent speed of intensity blob is quite different from chromospheric jet - like structures @xcite and type ii spicules @xcite .",
    "interpretation of the blob as a plasmoid propagating after a magnetic reconnection can be also ruled out as no explosive event is detected in upper photosphere during the observations .",
    "if magnetic reconnection took place in sub - photospheric layers , then the plasmoid should have much higher density than it is observed .",
    "the propagation speed of the blob can be modeled by transverse kink or fast sausage pulses as well .",
    "the second possibility is unlikely to occur as the observed spatial scale leads to the leaky regime of fast sausage waves .",
    "the first possibility needs further discussion as a kink pulse may lead to the intensity enhancement in inclined magnetic tubes @xcite .",
    "however , it requires very large amplitude and the pulse may have significantly curved form , which is not observed .",
    "therefore , the kink pulse is unlikely to be the reason of the intensity enhancement .",
    "following to the discussion above , it seems that the slow sausage scenario has strong background .",
    "we suggest that this is the first observation of sausage soliton in the solar atmosphere .",
    "we believe that careful analysis of sot time series will reveal other similar cases , which may enhance the interest to the soliton physics in the solar atmosphere .    of additional importance for the quantitative interpretation of the observed phenomenon as a propagating solitary wave would be taking into account of the plasma partial ionization effects in the solar chromosphere .",
    "the presence of even a small amount of neutral atoms in plasma is known to change significantly its dynamical and physical properties @xcite .",
    "different interaction of electrons , ions and neutral atoms with the magnetic field and each other causes the main specifics of the partially ionized plasma mhd , which differs significantly from the fully ionized plasma case .",
    "the inclusion of the ion - neutral collision effects into the scope of the proposed interpretation requires a special theoretical study of solitary waves behaviour in partially ionized plasmas which represents a subject for future work .",
    "it would be interesting to search analogy of soliton - like formations on the solar disc .",
    "possibly , chromospheric bright grains @xcite , which were often associated to the shocks , represent soliton formations in magnetic tubes .",
    "future detailed study is necessary to identify these features .",
    "1 .   time series of ca ii h line obtained by hinode / sot at the solar limb shows upward propagating intensity blob .",
    "the blob appears at 500 - 600 km height above the surface and reaches to the height of @xmath7 1700 km after 35 s. therefore , the mean apparent propagation speed is 35 km s@xmath0 .",
    "the blob has elongated form and the length to width ratio is @xmath7 3 in average .",
    "the length to width ratio , the relative intensity and the propagation speed change slightly during the propagation .",
    "the observed parameters fit with theoretically expected properties of slow sausage soliton propagating along a magnetic flux tube , which has the alfvn speed of @xmath7 70 km s@xmath0 and is in temperature balance with surroundings ( note , that an inclination of the tube along the line of sight may slightly increase the value of alfvn speed ) .",
    "therefore , we suggest that this is the first observational evidence of slow sausage soliton in the solar atmosphere .",
    "the width of the blob increases with height , which coincides with the expected expansion of magnetic tubes in the stratified atmosphere .",
