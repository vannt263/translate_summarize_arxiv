    "this work is part of a major project in which we determine periods and spectroscopic orbits of symbiotic binaries in base of observational data collected at casleo ( san juan , argentina ) along more than ten years . selecting the southern s - type symbiotic star fn sgr , we chose to use visual photometry from the variable star section circulars of the royal astronomical society of new zealand through 20 years of these circulars ( 1975@xmath02001 ; fig.1 ) and high resolution spectra obtained with the 2.15 m telescope of casleo during the period 1990@xmath02001 .",
    "we have measured the radial velocities of the cool component from the m - type absorption lines , specially fei , tii , nii , sii and coi .",
    "we have also identified and measured the blue cf - type absorption lines corresponding to crii , feii , tiii and yii which are believed to be linked to the hot companion ( e.g. mikoajewska & kenyon 1992 ; quiroga et al .",
    "the individual radial velocities were obtained by gaussian fitting of the line profiles an a mean value was calculated for each spectrum .",
    "in addition , we have determined the radial velocities of the broad emission wings of h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 and heii@xmath34686 which are formed in the inner region of the accretion disk or in an extended envelope near the hot component ( e.g. quiroga et al . 2002 ) . for this",
    "we have used the method outlined by schneider & young ( 1980 ) .",
    "optical emission line fluxes were also derived , either by integrating the line profile or by fitting gaussian profiles , as well as the [ tio]@xmath4 and [ tio]@xmath5 indices as defined by kenyon & fernandez - castro ( 1987 ) .",
    "we have analyzed the rasnz visual photometry using the period - search method described by schwarzenberg - czerny ( 1997 ) .",
    "a period of about 568 days was obtained from all visual data presented in fig.1 .",
    "the radial velocities , emission line fluxes , and [ tio]@xmath4 indices , all show the same periodicity , which we attribute to the orbital period . in all cases ,",
    "the most regular changes have been obtained with 568-day period , giving the ephemeris @xmath6",
    "the broad emission line wings of h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 and heii4686 and the blue cf type absorption lines show the highest amplitude and a mean velocity similar to the red giant systemic velocity .",
    "they are clearly in antiphase with the m - giant curve which suggest that they are fomed in a same region very near to the hot component ( fig.2 ) .",

    "the best orbital solution for the blue absorption system ( as well as those for the broad emission line wings ) leads to significant eccentricity whereas the red giant orbit is circular or nearly circular .",
    "combining the semi - amplitudes of the m giant and the blue absorption component for the circular orbit ( table 1 ) gives a mass ratio @xmath32 , the component masses of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and the binary separation @xmath35 .",
    "most of our spectroscopic observations were taken during the optical outburst phase ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the outburst behaviour is similar to that observed in other classical symbiotic stars ( e.g. ci cyg and ax per ) .",
    "the rise in optical brightness was first accompanied by a large increase in the [ oiii ] emission lines , and broadening of the emission line wings .",
    "the permitted hi and hei emission lines were also increasing although not as much as the forbidden lines , whereas heii4686 was decreasing .",
    "then , near the visual maximum ( 1996@xmath01998 ) the [ oiii ] emission decreased , and heii4686 practically disappeared . at the same time",
    "the permitted emission lines have maximum widths . in 1999 , the visual brightness began gradually declining ; the [ oiii ] and heii emission lines were increasing again .",
    "the [ oiii ] nebular emission reached maximum intensity in july@xmath0september 2000 , and after that was declining following the visual magnitudes .",
    "heii4686 emission reached maximum intensity in september@xmath0october 2000 , somewhat later than the forbidden line emission .",
    "+ the emission line changes indicate a decrease in the hot component temperature at the optical maximum to @xmath36 , possibly because of increasing optical depth in the hot component wind . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of the blue shell absorption system apparently associated with the hot component in all our spectra , including periods where the strong high - ionization features are present , suggests a double - temperature structure of the hot component .",
    "the emission line fluxes , if due to a photoionization , require the hot component temperature and luminosity of @xmath37 , @xmath38 at quiescence , and @xmath39 , @xmath40 at the optical maximum .",
    "the optical observed during the 1996 - 98 maximum is consistent with a presence of continuum source with @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( assuming a distance @xmath43 ) .",
    "we note here that similar behavior was observed during the optical outbursts of ax per ( mikoajewska & kenyon 1992 ) , and other active symbiotic systems , in particular , in ar pav ( quiroga et al . 2002 , and references therein ) , and it can be explained by a presence of optically thick accretion disks .",
