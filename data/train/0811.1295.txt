    "these characteristics give rise to interesting transport phenomena such as the absence of backscattering @xcite , anomalies in the quantum hall regime @xcite , weak anti - localization @xcite , so - called klein tunneling @xcite , and electron focusing analogous to optical effects that occur in negative refractive index materials @xcite .",
    "as such , one expects that grahene pn junctions should differ from traditional semiconductor pn junctions .",
    "the pn junction is a basic building block for electronic devices . developing a quantitative understanding of graphene pn junctions is an important step on the way to realizing novel devices such as graphene lenses @xcite and filters @xcite .",
    "our goal in this paper is to demonstrate that the non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) approach @xcite quantitatively explains recent experiments on graphene pn junctions , including the critical role of the junction depletion width and the increased in the odd resistance observed under low source / drain charge density conditions @xcite .",
    "electron transmission across a graphene pn junction occurs by interband tunneling . a theoretical treatment for an abrupt , graphene pn junction predicts that for a symmetric pn junction ( i.e. one in which the hole and electron densities on each side of the junction are equal ) the transmission probability is given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the angle between the electron s wave - vector and the normal to the junction interface @xcite .",
    "realistic pn junctions will have a transition region of finite width . for a smooth junction transition region of width",

    "this angular selectivity for electron transport across the pn junction serves as a filter , allowing states with @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9 ( where @xmath9 is the spread of the angular distribution ) to pass through more effectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath10 can be viewed as the bandwidth of this filter and is what gives rise to the larger resistance of a pn junction as compared to a uniform graphene sheet .",
    "several research groups have recently fabricated graphene pnp devices by using electrostatic gates to create p and n regions @xcite .",
    "the typical setup consists of a back - gate and top - gate , which are used to control the amount of charge density in the source / drain and channel regions respectively .",
    "for example , the back gates can be set to produce n - type source and drain regions and the top gate can be biased to change the middle ( channel ) region from n to p type .",
    "an asymmetry in the device s source to drain resistance as a function of top - gate voltage has been experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "the amount of this resistance asymmetry is a measure of the intrinsic property of the pn junction , provided that the mean free path of carriers is larger than the transition length of the junction .",
    "one can theoretically compute the junction s transition length accounting for non - linear screening effects @xcite . for recent experiments",
    "@xcite , typical transition lengths for pn junction are less than @xmath11 .",
    "recent experiments indicate that the carrier s mean free path is about @xmath12 under low temperature and moderate carrier density conditions of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is experimental evidence of fabry - perot interference effects within the channel region in devices with channel lengths less than @xmath12 @xcite , evidently a signature of phase coherent transport .",

    "this method allows us to accurately simulate the pn junction conductance for both abrupt and graded junctions under different bias conditions .",
