    "the observation of neutrino flavor oscillations constitutes an experimental proof of lepton flavor violation@xcite . in principle , other manifestations of such effects could be expected to show up in the charged lepton sector as well .",
    "however , the lack of a definitive model for neutrino mass generation implies that conclusive predictions for lepton flavor violating processes can not be made , and even assuming a concrete model realization for neutrino masses , predictions for such effects can only be done if the flavor structure of the corresponding realization is specified .    in this",
    "regards the minimal flavor violating hypothesis @xcite is a very useful guide for constructing predictive models in which lepton violating signals are entirely determined by the low - energy neutrino data",
    ". however minimal lepton flavor violation ( mlfv ) can not be uniquely implemented and depends on the new physics responsible for neutrino masses . here considering a type - i seesaw mechanism i.e. taking the new degrees of freedom to be heavy fermionic electroweak singlets ( right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos ) , we study the implications of the @xmath0 present in mlfv models assuming it",
    "is slightly broken .",
    "the full analysis is done in the context of a minimal type - i seesaw setup ( 2 rh neutrinos ) where the number of parameters and low energy observables are such that all flavor effects are entirely determined by neutrino observables up to normalizations factors .",
    "the kinetic lagrangian of the standard model extended with two rh neutrinos exhibits the global @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "this group can be rewritten as @xmath4 where @xmath5 can be identified with global hypercharge and lepton number whereas the @xmath0 is a `` new '' global symmetry , already mentioned in the introduction@xcite .",
    "the charges associated with this global transformation ( hereafter denoted by @xmath6 ) are arbitrary , and thus different @xmath6-charge assignments define different models . here",
    "we will explicitly consider the seesaw lagrangian with a slightly broken @xmath0 and discuss a generic model allows to decouple the lepton number breaking scale from the rh neutrino mass scale .",
    "but this decoupling implies also a suppression of the corresponding yukawa couplings , thus leading to non - observable charged lepton flavor violating effects . for more details see@xcite ] that arises from a particular r - charge assignment .    precisely speaking we refer to the following : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively the electroweak lepton doublets , singlets and rh neutrinos .",
    "the lagrangian is thus given by @xmath12 the dimensionless @xmath13 parameters determine the amount of @xmath0 breaking and thus are tiny , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the charge conjugation operator , the @xmath16 s are yukawa vectors in flavor space and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the parameters that define the rh neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the diagonalization of the majorana rh neutrino mass matrix leads to two quasi - degenerate states with masses given by @xmath19 and in the basis in which the rh neutrino mass matrix is diagonal the yukawa couplings @xmath20 become @xmath21 $ ] @xmath22 in terms of these redefined yukawa couplings , the effective light neutrino mass matrix , up to @xmath23 , is given by @xmath24 with @xmath25 note that we have expressed the parameters space vector @xmath26 and @xmath27 in terms of their unitary vector @xmath28 , @xmath29 and moduli @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "since @xmath32 small neutrino masses do not require heavy rh neutrinos or small yukawa couplings , thus potentially implying large lepton flavor violating effects .",
    "it turns out that due to the structure of the vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be entirely determined by means of the solar and atmospheric mass scales and mixing angles , up to the factors @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the expression depend on the light neutrino mass spectrum , in the normal case they read@xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 denote the columns of the leptonic mixing matrix and @xmath35",
    "with potentially large yukawa couplings and rh neutrinos in the tev ballpark , charged lepton flavor violating processes could be expected to have large rates . in what follows",
    "we analyze @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the decay branching ratios can be approximated by@xcite :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 stands for the total decay width of the corresponding decaying charged lepton @xmath40 .    among these lepton flavor violating processes , presently the @xmath1 transition is the most severely constrained .",
    "the meg collaboration recently established an upper bound of @xmath41 at the 90% c.l .",
    "so from now on we focus on that process . to quantify this effect , we randomly generate low energy observables in their @xmath42 ranges and the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath17 in the ranges @xmath43 $ ] and @xmath44 $ ] gev allowing rh neutrino mass splittings in the range @xmath45 $ ] gev .",
