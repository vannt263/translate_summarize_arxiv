    "we assumed that electrons produced by annihilations travel in straight lines .",
    "this would not be true were there primordial ( or magnetohydrodynamically generated ) magnetic fields in the vicinity of domain boundaries .",

    "if the magnetically - reduced range still exceeds @xmath49 , the width of the depletion zone , the annihilation rate is increased and our conclusions are strengthened . if the electron range were less than @xmath49 , electrons would deposit their energy near the annihilation zone rather than throughout the plasma . however , heating by uv photons alone results in the temperature profile plotted in fig .",
