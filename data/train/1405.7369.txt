    "the first episodes of star formation arguably mark one of the most important chemical transformations of our universe , a process where the initially pristine h and he nuclei were converted into heavy elements for the first time .",
    "although our current understanding of these first stars is far from complete , the qualitative picture is well - established ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent review ) ; the first stars formed in @xmath1 dark matter minihalos at redshifts @xmath2 @xcite , and were predominantly a massive population of stars owing to a lack of efficient cooling routes in the primordial gas .",
    "this picture continues to receive strong support from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and other references cited herein ) .",
    "despite the great success of these foundations , some of the most fundamental properties of the first stars have yet to be pinned down , including the distribution of their stellar mass @xcite , the mixing properties and energy released during their putative supernova ( sn ) explosion @xcite , their binary fraction @xcite , the distribution of their host minihalo masses @xcite , and the finer details of their chemical enrichment @xcite .    if metal - free stars ( or gas of primordial composition ) still exist in the present day universe , they have not yet been found . at present , the only primordial environments that have been uncovered are at high redshift @xcite ; the discovery of such systems is crucial for providing a direct physical insight into the formation environments of the first stars .",
    "otherwise , our complete understanding of the first stars relies on simulated universes and other indirect probes , such as the chemical yields from metal - free stars .",
    "fortunately , there now exist a small handful of gas - rich systems at high redshift with metallicities @xmath3 of solar that might be solely enriched by the earliest stellar populations @xcite .",
    "these recent advances at high redshift offer a new and highly complementary approach for studying the nucleosynthesis from the first stars , which has traditionally been pursued by studying the most metal - poor , second generation stars in the local universe @xcite .",
    "perhaps one of the most striking results that has surfaced from studies of metal - poor galactic halo stars is the great diversity in their chemical composition . specifically , around one - quarter of all stars with [ fe / h]@xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number abundance ratio of element x relative to element y , and the @xmath6 symbol refers to the solar value , taken from @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath7 exhibit a stark underabundance of heavy elements ( e.g. fe ) relative to lighter metals ( e.g. c ) @xcite , which becomes even more pronounced at lower [ fe / h ] abundance .",
    "such stars are collectively known as carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ) stars , and are somewhat arbitrarily defined to have [ c / fe]@xmath8 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "large samples of cemp stars have shown that there appears to be four distinct sub - classes , which are usually defined on the basis of their neutron - capture elements ( see @xcite for further details ) : ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) cemp-@xmath9 and cemp-@xmath10 stars , which are enhanced in the @xmath9-process and @xmath10-process relative to the solar composition , respectively ; ( 3 ) cemp-@xmath11 stars , which exhibit enhancements in both the @xmath10- and @xmath9- neutron - capture processes ; and ( 4 ) cemp - no stars , with a normal abundance pattern for their neutron - capture elements .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origin of these distinct classes of cemp stars .",
    "for example , the cemp-@xmath9 stars are known to be members of a binary system where an asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star transferred carbon - rich ( and @xmath9-process - rich ) material onto a low - mass long - lived companion star that we observe today to be anomalously rich in c ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , long - term monitoring of the radial velocities of such stars seems to confirm this picture @xcite .",
    "the origin of the cemp - no stars , however , is still a matter of debate .",
    "while some cemp - no stars could be an extension of the cemp-@xmath9 class to lower metallicity and lower @xmath9-process enhancement @xcite , there are several lines of evidence that support an alternative origin for the carbon enhancement in some cemp - no stars .",
    "first , the most fe - poor cemp - no stars exhibit the largest c / fe ratios @xcite and appear to be more common at lower metallicities @xcite .",
    "in addition , the overabundance of each element relative to fe decreases with increasing atomic number .",
    "this evidence suggests in fact that _ iron _ is strongly depressed in these stars , rather than carbon being strongly enhanced ( the latter is the case for cemp-@xmath9 stars ) .",
    "furthermore , the binarity properties of cemp - no stars appear to be markedly different from the cemp-@xmath9 class @xcite . collectively , these observations suggest that most of the cemp - no stars were probably born out of gas enriched by massive stars that ended their lives as type ii sne with low levels of mixing and a high degree of fallback @xcite",
    ".    however , there remains one aspect of this model that has yet to receive a satisfactory explanation  why does the fraction of cemp - no stars become more common relative to non - cemp stars at lower fe abundance ?",
    "is it possible to observe a star that has [ fe / h ]  @xmath12 and [ c / fe ]  @xmath13 ?",
    "one possible solution to explain why no such star has been observed was proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) , who require a minimum level of [ c / h ] and [ o / h ] to be present in the birth cloud of the second generation stars to allow efficient cooling by the fine - structure transitions of cii  and oi . in this picture , the cooling by cii  and oi  fine - structure lines allows the gas to fragment to smaller mass scales and form lower mass ( hence longer lived ) stars that have lived until the present day when we observe them .",
    "this model therefore implies that the increased fraction of cemp - no stars at low metallicity is a selection effect , since we can only observe the lowest mass , second generation stars born out of gas with a minimum abundance of c and o , irrespective of the [ fe / h ] abundance .",
    "this model was called into question with the discovery of the leo star ( @xcite ; [ fe / h]@xmath14 , [ c / fe]@xmath15 ) , which is the most metal - deficient star currently known . to explain this almost primordial star ,",
    "several authors have appealed to models of dust - induced fragmentation @xcite , which is able to assist low - mass star formation in the absence of high levels of c and o. in particular , @xcite propose that both fine - structure cooling and fragmentation by dust are required in order to explain the population of cemp - no stars in addition to the leo star .    in this paper , we present a simple solution to explain why carbon enhancements are more common at the lowest fe abundance .",
    "our interpretation is complementary to the methods described above , but does not rely on the detailed chemistry of the gas giving rise to the second generation of stars .",
    "we propose that the increased fraction of cemp - no stars at lower metallicity is a selection effect due to an intimate link between the energy released by the sne of the first stars and the host minihalo s ability to retain its gas : qualitatively , a type ii sn with a high explosion energy is able to remove more fe from the core of the massive star , and tends to produce a solar relative abundance of c to fe ( i.e. [ c / fe]@xmath16 ) .",
    "however , the high energy of such an explosion is more likely to evacuate the gas from the host minihalo thereby inhibiting the formation of second generation non - cemp stars . on the other hand , low - energy sne experience larger degrees of fallback which locks up the fe in the compact remnant of the massive star , while still yielding a full complement of c ( i.e. [ c / fe]@xmath17 ) . in this case , the low energy that is released by the sn is unable to evacuate the gas from the host potential , thereby allowing a generation of cemp stars to form in the same minihalo , given sufficient time for the gas to cool .",

    "this general picture has been confirmed by more recent work , where the minimum minihalo mass that is able to produce sufficient molecular hydrogen and therefore cool efficiently to successfully host a first generation of stars is @xmath23 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore start our calculations by drawing a random redshift and minihalo virial mass ( @xmath24 ) from the halo mass function derived by @xcite , with a lower - mass cut - off at @xmath25 in the redshift interval @xmath26 .",
    "the halo concentration , @xmath27 , is chosen by extrapolating the halo - mass  concentration relation derived by @xcite , and is typically in the range @xmath28 for the halo masses and redshift range that we consider here .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we assume the initial temperature of the gas is set by the virial temperature of the minihalo scaled ( by a factor of @xmath29 ) to match cosmological simulations ( see e.g. figure 19 of @xcite ) , and is of the form : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the hubble parameter at the minihalo collapse redshift ( @xmath32 ) is defined to be the point at which the host minihalo s gas reaches high enough densities for the first stars to form ",

    "stars in the mass range @xmath39 experience a series of such pulsations , causing the star to eject the outermost layers before it quietly collapses to a black hole @xcite .",

    "stars with mass @xmath43 are sufficiently massive that the onset of the pair - instability and the subsequent contraction and burning is unable to halt the gravitational collapse of the star , thus providing no metal enrichment @xcite . in summary ,",
    "metal - free stars in the mass range @xmath37 are currently considered to be the dominant source of metal enrichment for the second stars , with perhaps an additional contribution from the pulsational pair - instability sne .",
    "we have thus adopted the model yield calculations performed by @xcite , which provide illustrative yields for 120 different stellar masses in the range @xmath37 ( with some models differing in mass by just @xmath44 ) .",
    "each star was exploded with a piston located at the base of the oxygen shell ( where the entropy per baryon @xmath45 ) , providing a final kinetic energy to the ejecta at infinity of either 0.3 , 0.6 , 0.9 , 1.2 , 1.5 , 1.8 , 2.4 , 3 , 5 , or 10 in units of @xmath46 .",

    "therefore , the final set of yields for the stars considered in our study totals 16,800 models .",
    "after drawing a stellar mass from the appropriate initial mass function ( imf ; see below ) , we randomly draw an explosion energy and level of mixing from a uniform distribution .",
    "given that we have no handle on the mixing and explosion properties of the first stars , our assumption allows sufficient flexibility to explore all of the available parameter space . in figure",

    "however , the form of the primordial stellar imf also influences the probability that a minihalo will retain its gas , since the presupernova gas distribution strongly depends on stellar masses . for the example shown in figure  [ fig : densprof ] , a @xmath108 star , despite having a lower luminosity than the @xmath109 star , drastically reduces the central gas density of the minihalo during its relatively longer life . at a fixed minihalo mass ,",

    "this implies that there may be a strong selection bias when interpreting the nature of the first stars by studying their chemical yields in the stellar atmospheres of the most metal - poor second generation stars in our galaxy .",
    "the sne that evacuated the gas from their host minihalo would have been unable to encode their metal yields in a second generation of stars .",

    "in addition to this bias , we suggest that the high energy of their sn explosion would have evacuated the gas from their host minihalo , resulting in their chemical signature being rarely incorporated into a subsequent stellar population ( see @xcite ) .",

    "we have ignored stars from these samples with [ ba / fe ]  @xmath112 , which are probably enriched with the @xmath9-process .",
    "we supplement these data with three cemp - no stars from @xcite , four stars from @xcite , and the two metal - poor halo stars reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have also included a small handful of stars from the milky way ultra - faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies , including three stars from segue 1 @xcite and one star from bo \" otes i @xcite .    in general , the variation in [ c / fe ] as a function of the fe abundance for our models",
    "show a good agreement with the trend exhibited by the most metal - poor stars , especially given that there are no free parameters in our models .",
    "in particular , our calculations match the currently available data for the most fe deficient cemp stars , while simultaneously matching the leo star @xcite and most of the ` carbon - normal ' stars just below [ fe / h ]  @xmath113 .",
    "all minihalos are enriched to a total metallicity [ z / h ]  @xmath113 , which is in good agreement with cosmological hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we further note that the most fe - deficient cemp stars need not have formed from the products of a single sn ; our models demonstrate that the most fe - deficient cemp stars can also be produced by a small multiple of first stars .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cfefeh ] , there is also a small cluster of @xmath114 ` super ' cemp stars that are offset from our models toward higher [ c / fe ] and higher [ fe / h ] .",
    "this small handful of stars is clearly distinct from both our model calculations and from observations of other cemp stars at a similar metallicity .",
    "in addition , these stars are found in both the milky way halo and satellite dwarf galaxies .",
    "one possibility is that these stars may have formed in minihalos that were enriched by early episodes of agb nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "a similar possibility is that these low - metallicity cemp - no stars may have hosted an agb binary companion , and therefore represent the ` low-@xmath9 ' extremely metal - poor counterparts of the cemp-@xmath9 population @xcite .",
    "this scenario is supported by models of agb nucleosynthesis at [ fe / h ]  @xmath115 , which predict a [ c / fe ] abundance in the range @xmath116 to @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "these models are consistent with the level of enrichment observed for the super cemp stars .",
    "dedicated radial velocity monitoring for this sample of stars is now required to confirm if they are members of binary systems . at present , radial velocity variations for 5 of these 12 stars have already been measured @xcite , 3 of which show evidence of binarity0428 , cs22957@xmath118027 , and j1422@xmath1190031 .",
    "the two stars with no present evidence for binarity are j1613@xmath1195309 and segue 1 - 7 .",
    "the remaining seven stars have undetermined radial velocity variations : he0233@xmath1180343 , he1012@xmath1181540 , he1310@xmath1180536 , he2139@xmath1185432 , cs22958@xmath118042 , cs29498@xmath118043 , and boo21 @xcite . ] .    alternatively , this handful of cemp stars could have been born out of gas that was enriched by metal - free stars exploding as type - ii sne , as considered herein , with a boost in the cno elements provided by stars that yield no fe - peak elements .",
    "several models do entertain stellar yields with no fe - peak elements , including intermediate mass population iii stars @xcite , models with rotationally enhanced mass loss from massive stars @xcite , and massive stars that end their lives as a pulsational pair instability sne ( with progenitor masses in the range @xmath120 , @xcite ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "if this cluster of stars does not represent a distinct population , their disagreement with our models might be a consequence of our assumption that the metal yields from the first stars are uniformly mixed with the swept up pristine material .",
    "inefficient mixing has recently been proposed as a possible explanation for the elevated , constant [ @xmath121/fe ] ratios seen for several stars over a broad range of metallicity in the segue 1 ultra - faint dwarf spheroidal galaxy @xcite .",
    "if mixing is considered to be less efficient than allowed by our fiducial model , the contours in figure  [ fig : cfefeh ] would be inflated to account for regions of relatively higher and lower metallicity . however , inefficient mixing is unable to explain the absence of stars between the ` ordinary ' cemp stars and the ` super ' cemp stars .",
    "the details of the mixing process can only be addressed with more realistic 3d , cosmological hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we also note that the [ fe / h ] abundance that we derive from our models depends on the amount of pristine h gas swept up by the blastwave , which is fixed by the energy delivered by the sn and the potential of the host minihalo .",
    "our fiducial model ( see section  [ sec : retention ] ) requires that the gas must not be lifted to beyond the virial radius in order for the minihalo to retain its gas .",
    "if we relax this criterion to allow models where the blastwave stalls at twice the virial radius , the distributions of the models presented in figure  [ fig : cfefeh ] would be shifted toward lower [ fe / h ] , since ` additional ' pristine gas will be swept up .",
    "similarly , if we were to enforce a stricter retention criterion , the models shift toward higher [ fe / h ] .",
    "we explore this possibility in figure  [ fig : halfvir ] for the case where two stars ( i.e. a population iii binary ) are born per minihalo , and require that each minihalo is only able to retain its gas if the sn blastwave does not extend beyond half the virial radius . enforcing a stricter criterion results in only a minor shift to the overall distribution of [ c / fe ] and [ fe / h ] values .",
    "our retention criterion is therefore relatively insensitive to the conclusions drawn here regarding the origin of cemp stars at low metallicity . as a final note",
    ", our models have also assumed that stellar multiplicity is independent of the minihalo mass . in principle",
    ", the multiplicity of the first stars may depend on the thermal evolution of the collapsing cloud , which in turn depends on the mass of the minihalo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , this should not significantly affect the trend of [ c / fe ] with [ fe / h ] ; for a given imf , our simulation results exhibit a general similarity in the [ c / fe ]  [ fe / h ] plane , independent of the stellar multiplicity .",
    "+   +   +      the number of stars that exhibit an enhancement in carbon relative to those stars that do not is known to be much higher at lower fe abundance @xcite . in the extremely metal - poor regime ( [ fe / h ]",
    "@xmath122 ) , the dominant class of these carbon - enhanced stars are those that exhibit normal abundances of their neutron - capture elements @xcite . in this section , we use our suite of realistic chemical enrichment models from the first stars to estimate the fraction of cemp stars at the lowest metallicities . in doing so",
    ", we assume that all values of the ` mixing ' parameter from the @xcite metal - free nucleosynthesis models are equally probable .",
    "we further assume that each minihalo that is able to retain its gas will form a second generation of stars . using the definition proposed by @xcite",
    ", we define our models to be carbon - enhanced when [ c / fe ]  @xmath123 .",
    "the fraction of our models that produce carbon - enhanced minihalos as a function of the fe abundance is displayed in figure  [ fig : cempfrac ] for the two imfs under consideration . using the same criterion , we have calculated the observed fraction of carbon - enhanced halo stars from the data sample described in section  [ sec : nucleo ] , excluding the four stars that have been observed in the segue 1 and botes i dwarf spheroidal galaxies .    a general prediction of our models  independent of the imf and gas mixing efficiency",
    " is that all future stars that are discovered with an fe abundance [ fe / h ]  @xmath124 should almost certainly exhibit a carbon enhancement . before drawing conclusions from the cemp fraction at somewhat higher metallicities",
    ", we caution that some of the stars in the observational sample may not have been exclusively enriched by population iii stars ; some of the cemp stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath122 may have seen pollution from an extinct agb companion star , or otherwise may have condensed from gas that was also enriched by low - metallicity population ii stars .",
    "these two possibilities would respectively under- or overestimate the observed cemp fraction relative to our models . despite these potential caveats , our models succeed in producing a decrease in the cemp fraction toward higher [ fe / h ] that is in broad agreement with the current observational data .",
    "we have developed a simple formalism with no free parameters to investigate the detailed chemical enrichment signatures from the first stars .",
    "we propose that there is a strong link between the chemistry born into the second stars , and the host minihalo s ability to retain its gas reservoir following the sne from the first stars .",
    "qualitatively , massive metal - free stars that produce high - energy sne are able to eject significant fe from their core , but will also efficiently evacuate the gas from their host minihalo thereby inhibiting the formation of the second stars . on the other hand , minihalos that host low - energy sne are able to retain their gas reservoir but , as a consequence , yield very little fe from the highly bound core of the pop iii star . in both cases , high - energy and low - energy sne",
    "eject a full complement of the lower atomic number elements , such as c , which are less bound to the massive star .",
    "the net result is to produce a significant number of fe - poor second generation stars that are highly rich in the low atomic number elements , in accord with the present observations of the most fe - poor stars in the halo of the milky way . on the basis of our detailed suite of calculations that explore an extensive region of parameter space for the properties of the first stars and their host minihalos , we draw the following main conclusions .",
    "( 1 ) in addition to the energy released by the first stars , the primordial stellar imf plays an important role in determining whether or not a minihalo will retain its reservoir of gas , and the resulting chemistry of the second generation of stars .",
    "the longest - lived massive metal - free stars dramatically reduce the central gas density distribution during their ( relatively ) long life . as a consequence ,",
    "the gas is displaced to larger radii which indirectly assists the supernova blastwave in evacuating the gas from the host minihalo .",
    "( 2 ) the dark matter halos that are the least disrupted by the first stars will also be the first environments to host a second stellar generation . in this context",
    ", cemp stars would have been among the first population ii stars to have formed in the first galaxies .",
    "our calculations also suggest that the chemistry that seeded the cemp stars was in place at very early times and in relatively low - mass halos ( a  few  @xmath125 ) .",
    "( 3 ) we propose that some carbon - enhanced stars that contain normal abundances of their neutron - capture elements ( the so - called cemp - no stars ) are the by - product of an intimate link between the explosions of the first stars and their host minihalo s ability to retain its gas .",
    "our suite of models are able to reproduce the general dependence of [ c / fe ] with [ fe / h ] , as well as the variation in the fraction of cemp stars relative to non - cemp stars as a function of the fe abundance .",
    "( 4 ) it is commonly believed that the most fe - deficient galactic halo stars were enriched by just a single metal - free star .",
    "although our calculations are certainly consistent with this picture , one can not rule out the possibility that a small multiple of stars contributed to the enrichment of these second generation fe - poor stars .",
    "( 5 ) the present lack of chemical evidence for very massive stars ( @xmath0 ) does not suggest they were uncommon or did not exist .",
    "rather , the large energy released during their sn explosion could have inhibited their products from being incorporated into subsequent stellar populations .",
    "our models suggest that the first stars commonly enrich some halos to 1/1000 of solar metallicity , similar to some of the most metal - poor damped lyman-@xmath121 systems already known at redshift @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "therefore , understanding the physical properties of these near - pristine neutral gas reservoirs , may provide key clues for understanding the star formation environments of the second stars @xcite .",
    "finally , the recent discovery of carbon - enhanced fe - poor stars in both the segue 1 and bo \" otes i milky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies @xcite , adds further support to the idea that these systems are the surviving relics of the first galaxies @xcite .",
