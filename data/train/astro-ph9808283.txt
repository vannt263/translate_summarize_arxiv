    "afterglows from gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) have been discovered for 13 grbs since the first detection of the afterglow of grb970228 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest cosmological fireball afterglow model ( @xcite ) seems to be in a good general agreement with the observed behavior ( @xcite ) , or at least with the power - law decay .",
    "however , several works have tried to investigate more subtle effects which can change the afterglow characteristics . in particular ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite have tried to explain the deviations from an ideal power - law , and the variety of light curves using a model in which a source emits shells with different lorentz factors , which results in a gradual energy supply to the shell of shocked matter . in their work",
    "they have neglected the thickness of the shell of shocked matter , and did not calculate its structure . however , as evident from the classical treatment of adiabatic blast waves by @xcite , the evolution of a blast wave depends strongly on the detailed structure of the matter inside it .",
    "therefore , it remains to investigate the complete hydrodynamics and energy budget of a slow power - law decay blast wave .",
    "the dynamics of blast waves with gradual energy supply is also relevant for the study of compact steep - spectrum objects ( css ) , gigahertz peak spectrum objects ( gps ) , and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) radio lobes .",
    "the generally accepted model for these objects ( see e.g. @xcite ) describes a blast wave continuously powered by a jet from an agn .",
    "similar models have also been used for interstellar bubbles ( @xcite,@xcite ) , for plerionic supernova remnants ( see e.g. @xcite ) and for galactic super - shells ( @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we consider blast waves with a gradual energy supply by a hot wind .",
    "specifically we obtain a new self similar solution for a continuously powered radiative blast waves .",
    "even if this situation may not be directly applicable to astrophysical objects , it is still important .",
    "self similar solutions are simple enough that they may be solved analytically ( sometimes ) , and are easy to grasp .",
    "furthermore , it is likely that a generic blast wave will have tendency to approach self similarity .",
    "adiabatic self similar blast waves with energy injection have been treated previously by @xcite in the relativistic regime . in the newtonian regime castor , mccray and weaver ( 1975 ) and @xcite",
    "have investigated both radiative and adiabatic blast waves with energy injection , but have not treated the case of fast decaying sources , which did not fit into their self similar framework . in this paper",
    "we show that the inclusion of radiative losses has a qualitative influence on the solutions . using our new solutions",
    "we obtain an accurate result for the fully radiative steady injected blast waves , which were treated approximately by @xcite .",
    "we add new solutions for a region of the parameter space which has not been treated yet neither in the newtonian nor in the ultra - relativistic limits .",
    "self similarity appears only if the physical situation can be characterized by a minimal number of dimensional parameters , such that physical scales can be constructed only from a single combination of those parameters .",
    "therefore , by assuming that a blast wave behaves self similarly , we can deduce the functional form of different physical processes .",
    "in fact , adiabatic blast waves already exhibit self similar behavior without additional parameters .",
    "this requires that energy injection and radiation processes in self similar blast waves will not have intrinsic scales .",
    "specifically , the injection rate must be a power - law",
    ". the radiation process should also be self - similar . in order to satisfy that demand ,",
    "we assume that the radiation process results with a semi - radiative scenario where the cooling mechanisms are fast comparable to hydrodynamic time scales ( `` fast cooling '' ) , but only a fraction of the energy produced by the shock is radiated away .",
    "this would take place , naturally , in any collisionless shock acceleration ( see @xcite , hereafter cps98 ) .",
    "for example , in a grb afterglow the cooling time scales are shorter then the hydrodynamic time scale , ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and a fraction of the energy stays with shocked protons which do not cool .    we describe our model in sec . [",

    "it is composed of a central source emitting a wind which interacts with a surrounding medium and creates a blast wave .",
    "we proceed in sec .",
    "[ sec : energy_conserve ] by calculating the blast wave energy and the radiated luminosity assuming self - similarity _ alone_. in sec .",
    "[ sec : newt_ss ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : rel_ss ] we split the discussion to the newtonian and ultra - relativistic limits , assuming the self - similar radiation mechanism of cps98 . for each case",
    "we obtain the hydrodynamic solution and the radiative efficiencies ( analytic solution for the ultra relativistic limit , and numerical for the newtonian limit ) .",
    "finally we summarize our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "we consider a spherical semi - radiative blast wave , that appears when energy is released continuously into an ambient medium .",
    "this results in a strong shock wave that expands supersonically .",
    "we consider the regime where the influence of the injected and initial mass is negligible , and that the pressure of the surrounding medium is small compared to the energy density of the flow .",
    "these assumptions are necessary in order to obtain a self similar solution ( see e.g. @xcite ,  99 ) .",
    "we assume that the source supplies energy in the form of a hot wind with a negligible mass .",
    "this wind pushes away the surrounding medium , and creates a cavity .",
    "this simple model leads to different qualitative behaviors , depending on the expansion velocity of the blast wave .",
    "if this velocity is much lower than the speed of light , ( newtonian limit ) the sound velocity of the ejected wind can be much higher than the expansion velocity . in this case",
    "the pressure inside the cavity settles fast and becomes isobaric .",
    "this isobaric bubble pushes away the ambient matter and creates a shock wave .",
    "( this model , where the injected wind is treated as an isobaric interior has been widely used in the study of radio lobes in active galactic nuclei ( @xcite ) ) .    in the ultra relativistic case",
    "the hot wind has different dynamics .",
    "the sound velocity of the wind is of the order of the speed of light , but it is always comparable to the expansion velocity . in this case",
    "we assume that the wind is so sparse that its particles inside the cavity do not interact , and simply move in straight lines , close to the speed of light , until they reach the edge of the cavity . near this edge",
    "they undergo a strong shock , presumably a collisionless one , which compresses them .",
    "consequently , this compressed fluid produces a shock which advances into the ism .    both in the newtonian and in the ultra relativistic limits the blast wave is composed of four regions .",
    "( a ) the injected wind : contains wind that did not interact , yet , with the blast wave . in the newtonian limit",
    "the reverse shock reaches the center , and this region disappears .",
    "( b ) shocked wind : contains wind that was compressed due to the interaction with shocked ism .",
    "it is separated from region ( a ) by a reverse shock .",
    "( c ) shocked ism : contains ism that has been compressed by the forward shock at the blast wave front .",
    "a contact discontinuity separates this region from the shocked wind region .",
    "( d ) ism at rest",
    ". a schematic view of the four regions appears in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] .",
    "we look for self similar solutions for semi - radiative blast waves with central energy supply .",
    "if a blast wave contains only one of these two mechanisms ( energy injection and radiation ) , each of them leads to a different temporal behavior . as self similarity",
    "does not allow the existence of several time scales in the solution , it is apriori not known whether such solutions exist .",
    "self similarity requires a dimensionless energy injection mechanism .",
    "we therefore deduce that the energy is supplied to any interval along the self similar solution at a rate @xmath0 .",
    "the energy transfer rates along the self similar hydrodynamic profile ( especially @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) scale the same , and differ only by a constant factor , which depends on the exact solution .",
    "however , this scaling can differ from @xmath3 , the energy supplied by the central source , as a fraction of the injected energy resides in the interior regions .",
    "region ( a ) contains a freely expanding wind .",
    "if it exists , it does not depend on the blast wave parameters . for self similarity",
    "the energy transfer rate from region ( a ) to region ( b - c ) must satisfy the self similarity scaling laws .",
    "however , it is possible that the energy in region ( a ) will evolve differently .    assuming that a self similar solution exists , we can write the energy loss rate as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the energy stored in a fixed interval of the self similar profile . in the newtonian limit we choose @xmath5 to denote the energy stored in shocked ism alone ( and the corresponding injection rate is @xmath2 ) and in the ultra - relativistic case @xmath5 denotes the energy stored in the entire shocked matter ( and the corresponding injection rate is @xmath1 ) . the value of the constant @xmath6 depends on this definition , but it is always dimensionless .",
    "this proportionality is evident from self similarity , as there exists only one way to construct the dimensionality of @xmath7 ( energy / time ) using the characteristic parameters .",
    "note that this argument holds for _ any _ self similar radiation mechanism .",
    "the energy conservation equation includes losses as well as injection from the blast wave center , @xmath8 for @xmath9 eq .",
    "[ de_dt ] has an analytic solution @xmath10 where @xmath11 is set by the initial conditions .",
    "we proceed by investigating the asymptotic behavior of this equation for different values of @xmath12 and @xmath6 . in cases where the equations behaves self",
    "similarly we find the power - law index of the energy temporal behavior @xmath13 , and obtain the relations between the various power - law indices .",
    "a summary of the different limits appears in table 1 .    for @xmath14",
    ", we reproduce the instantaneous energy injection case and eq .",
    "[ e_of_t ] trivially becomes a power - law with @xmath15 . even in this simple case , an extrapolation toward @xmath16 results in an infinite energy . from eq .",
    "[ lrad_basic ] it is obvious that the radiated energy also diverges in this limit .",
    "these two infinities cancel each other , and at finite times the energy is always finite .",
    "a specific blast wave with an arbitrary initial energy evolves to this self similar behavior at late times .",
    "clearly the limit @xmath16 has no physical relevance and only the late time behavior is interesting .",
    "it is therefore better to treat the solution from @xmath17 backward in time , as this is the region where we expect the blast wave to evolve according to the self similar solution . at any finite time all the energies are finite , and we encounter no infinities using this view .",
    "we discuss @xmath18 , which is the energy that will be radiated from time @xmath19 to infinity .",
    "it is evident that @xmath20 , as the energy stored in the shell decreases to zero when @xmath21 .",
    "sources which scales with @xmath22 were not treated so far . in this scenario",
    "the injected and radiated energies from @xmath23 are infinite , similarly to the @xmath14 case .",
    "this means that the solution is not physical near @xmath23 .",
    "as in the @xmath14 case , we overcome the infinities by discussing @xmath24 .",
    "the solutions are divided into three sub - classes , depending on the relation between @xmath12 and @xmath6 :    * if @xmath25 the injected energy decreases slower than the rate of an un - injected blast wave , and the power - laws are set by the injection law .",
    "the energies injected and radiated from @xmath23 are infinite .",
    "however , the energy that will be radiated until infinity is always larger than the stored energy , and the energy which will be injected is larger ( smaller ) than the stored energy if @xmath12 is larger ( smaller ) than @xmath26 .",
    "note that even if the stored energy is larger than the energy injected until infinity , the evolution is set by the injected energy power - law . in both cases",

    "the energy stored in the shocked matter is a constant fraction of the energy injected so far , and the same holds for the radiated energy .",

    "[ e_of_t ] is again a power - law , now with @xmath37 , i.e. the shell holds a constant energy which is set by initial conditions .",

    "it is generally determined only by solving the complete hydrodynamic equations .",
