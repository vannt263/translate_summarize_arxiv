    "pumping pulse applied to one - dimensional ( 1d ) mott insulators with spin - density - wave ( sdw ) correlation creates not only a photoinduced metallic state  @xcite but also a photoinduced charge - density - wave ( cdw ) state  @xcite . in two dimensions ,",
    "the photoexcitation of underdoped cuprates induces a signature of enhanced superconductivity  @xcite . even in a conventional superconductor ,",
    "an observation of the amplitude mode  @xcite is under intensive investigation within the field of nonequilibrium and nonlinear phenomena induced by a transient electric field .",
    "the time evolution of optical conductivity in the ultrafast process has been theoretically examined  @xcite , since this quantity contains information on the photoinduced charge dynamics and the initial relaxation through internal degrees of freedom of a given closed system . in mott insulators",
    ", photoexcitation is expected to induce a new excitation channel inside the mott gap .",
    "the nature of those states has not been fully understood from a theoretical viewpoint even for 1d mott insulators where , due to spin charge separation , the spin degrees of freedom affect the charge dynamics much less than in two - dimensional ( 2d ) mott insulators  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the physical properties of photoinduced states , their positions within the mott gap , and their influence on the time evolution of the nonequilibrium optical properties . for this purpose , we calculate the time - dependent optical conductivity of a 1d extended hubbard model driven by a transient laser pulse . in this model , one can change the ground state from the sdw phase to the cdw phase by changing the interaction parameters and tuning the laser pulse so as to enhance charge correlation even within the sdw phase  @xcite .",
    "we find that photoinduced in - gap excitations appear in a different manner , depending on the nature of the initial ground state , i.e. , sdw or cdw state . in the sdw ,",
    "a dominant in - gap excitation emerges at the low - energy region reflecting the energy difference between the even - odd parity of photoexcited states . in the cdw ,",
    "in - gap states appear in the middle of the mott gap and their origin can be attributed to photogenerated carriers .",
    "we also find that the signature of the in - gap excitations emerges in the time evolution of physical quantities such as the kinetic energy and peak intensity of the in - gap excitations as a characteristic oscillation .",

    "the application of a spatially uniform and time - dependent electric field expressed by a vector potential @xmath9 is incorporated into the hopping terms via the peierls substitution : @xmath10 leading to @xmath11 .",

    "the average incoming number of photons per lattice site during the pump is estimated to be @xmath17 .    in our calculation ,",
    "the system s temporal evolution is evaluated by the time - dependent lanczos method , where , within the reach of the exact diagonalization , the time - dependent wave function @xmath18 can be obtained exactly  @xcite . based on the information of @xmath18 ,",
    "we calculate the time - dependent current density @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the current operator .    motivated by the experimental pump - probe setup , we use the following strategy to obtain the time - dependent optical conductivity after pumping . for a given pump ,",
    "we trace the temporal evolution of the system twice : first , without the probe and the second time with the applied probe .",
    "the current induced by the probing pulse @xmath21 is obtained from the current difference between these two consecutive simulations . the subsequent fourier transformations on @xmath21 and @xmath22 produce the time - dependent optical conductivity  @xcite as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the time difference between the probing pulse and the pumping pulse and @xmath25 with a small positive number @xmath26 .",
    "introduction of @xmath26 is necessary for obtaining the spectral weight that is due to the drude peak in the limit of @xmath27 . we have checked that @xmath28 gives a good agreement with that obtained by a nonequilibrium linear - response theory  @xcite as long as the strength and the width of the probing pulse are small enough .",
    "we note that the result is also insensitive to the details of the probing pulse , regardless of the shape of the vector potential and the central frequency .    in our numerical calculations",

    "as expected , with increasing @xmath40 , the exciton peak at @xmath43 loses its weight continuously and the low - energy in - gap peak increases .     for the sdw phase of the extended hubbard model with @xmath32 .",

    "( c ) @xmath36 , @xmath42 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath48 is ten times larger than the case of ( b ) , resulting in an enhancement of charge correlation after pumping  @xcite .",
    "( d ) comparison between @xmath49 and @xmath36 with @xmath42 , @xmath44 , @xmath41 , and @xmath45 .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we now discuss the origin of the low - energy peak seen in figs .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](b ) .",
    "since the peak appears only after excitation with the pump pulse , its origin should be related to photoexcited states .",
    "the photoexcitation excites carriers into the state that gives rise to the absorption peak in the equilibrium , which is an optically allowed odd - parity state .",
    "the probe pulse couples in part to the photoinduced carriers in the odd - parity state , resulting in an excitation from the optically allowed state to an optically forbidden even - parity state . in mott insulators",
    ", it is known that the optically forbidden excitonic state is located slightly above the optically allowed excitonic state  @xcite .",
    "therefore , nonequilibrium optical conductivity should detect such an excitation .",
    "this is the origin of the low - energy peak .",
    "its energy thus corresponds to the energy separation between the optically allowed state ( exciton peak ) and the forbidden state . in order to confirm this",
    ", we perform the same calculation on a smaller system size .",
    "the optically forbidden state is known to be lower in energy than the allowed one if the small system has periodic boundary conditions .",
    "a @xmath49 lattice with @xmath42 is such a case .",
    "if the optically forbidden state is lower in energy than the optically allowed one , a negative - energy excitation appears after pumping , leading to negative weight at the positive - energy side since @xmath50 is odd in @xmath51 .",
    "this actually occurs in the @xmath49 lattice as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) , where @xmath52 is compared with that of the @xmath36 lattice . the data for @xmath49 exhibit a peak at @xmath53 with a negative weight in contrast to the @xmath36 case with a positive weight .",
    "this confirms our hypothesis that low - energy in - gap excitation comes from the excitation from the optically allowed to forbidden state .",

    "the blue thin line represents @xmath52 for the same system . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    it is vital to test whether the photoinduced low - energy in - gap excitation demonstrated in figs .  [ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](b ) can be detected by pump - probe optical experiments . a recent time - dependent optical reflectivity measurement on _ bis_(ethylendithyo)-tetrathiafulvalene - difluorotetracyanoquinodimethane et - f@xmath56tcnq has indicated the presence of photoinduced low - energy states located around @xmath57100  mev by analyzing the intensity oscillation near an exciton peak  @xcite .",
    "this energy is well below the energy of the exciton peak , 675  mev .",
    "the situation looks similar to figs .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and ( b ) . in order to explore the possibility of detecting the in - gap excitation",
    ", we calculate @xmath35 and make a fourier analysis , as is the case of the experiment .",
    "figure  [ fig2](a ) shows the contour plot of @xmath35 ( @xmath54 ) for a @xmath49 ring with @xmath32 and @xmath37 .",
    "we note that in this system and parameter set the photoinduced in - gap excitation emerges with a positive - spectral weight at @xmath39 .",
    "we can find an oscillating behavior of a photoinduced state below the exciton peak at @xmath58 as a function of @xmath24 .",
    "the oscillation has a period of @xmath59 .",
    "the fourier amplitudes of the maximum intensity near @xmath55 and the corresponding position are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , together with @xmath52 .",
    "we observe a dominant peak at @xmath60 in both the position and the intensity .",
    "the peak position of the fourier amplitude roughly matches the position of the photoinduced in - gap excitation at @xmath39 , which indicates it might come from the rabi oscillation of the two odd - even states .",
    "we also find that such a low - frequency oscillation close to the energy of the in - gap excitation does not occur in the cases with the negative - weight peak , e.g. , @xmath61 at @xmath49 ( not shown ) .",
    "therefore , we consider that the oscillation appearing in the exciton peak reflects the energy of the in - gap excitation .",
    "we next consider the case of a large pump width @xmath48 for @xmath42 , where a strong enhancement of short - range charge correlation after pumping has been reported in ref .  .",
    "the large width of the pump pulse @xmath15 leads to a well - tuned energy transfer between the pump pulse and the system .",
    "after the pump pulse we thus expect an enhanced population of excited states around @xmath16 , which is tuned to the position of the absorption peak .",
    "such a nonthermal population of states around @xmath16 naturally leads to the appearance of the negative weight of the absorption peak , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) .",
    "in addition to the negative weight , we find a pronounced structure around @xmath62 in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) as compared to the case of small @xmath15 [ fig .",

    "[ fig1](c ) , the structure around @xmath62 largely diminishes as it is accompanied by the vanishing of the induced charge correlations ( not shown here ) . since the pumping pulses with @xmath45 used in fig .",

    "[ fig1](c )  @xcite , the pronounced structure around @xmath62 in fig .",

    "figure  [ fig3](a ) shows the @xmath24 dependence of @xmath35 for @xmath65 .",
    "the weight of the absorption peak at @xmath73 substantially decreases with pumping .",
    "a low - energy structure with both positive and negative weights around @xmath74 emerges and exhibits a strong @xmath24 dependence , which has not been seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . because of a strong time dependence , we consider that the low - energy excitations are not a signature of photoinduced states . on the other hand ,",
    "a strong in - gap peak appears at @xmath75 with weak @xmath24 dependence .",
    "we regard this as a relevant photoinduced state .",
    "the @xmath35 for @xmath66 also shows a similar in - gap excitation that is independent of the pumping condition and @xmath24 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "therefore , the in - gap state is expected as a characteristic of the cdw phase .",
    "we now discuss the origin of the in - gap state in the cdw phase .",
    "again , we should notice that the pumping creates photo - carriers in the system .",
    "however , in the cdw phase , a metallic or low - energy excitation is unstable as seen in fig .",
    "this is expected to be related to the charge distribution of the cdw ground state with the characteristic arrangement of alternating doubly occupied and empty sites .",
    "the photo - carriers are created by transforming pairs of doubly occupied and empty sites to singly occupied ones , but the movement of electrons is still blocked by the presence of neighboring doubly occupied sites .",

    "similar to the case of sdw , this characteristic oscillation related to the in - gap state is also recognized from the analysis of the remaining main absorption peak ( not shown here ) .",
