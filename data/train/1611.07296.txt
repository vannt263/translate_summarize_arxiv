    "the problem of the magnetorotational instability is closely connected with the accretion disk problem .",
    "these huge astrophysical objects , consisting of dust and ionized gas , possess an amount of angular momentum which prevents them from contraction .",
    "the angular momentum has to be somehow extracted and transported outwards , and the most effective way to do that is turbulence .",
    "accretion disk flows have , however , hydrodynamically stable keplerian angular velocity profile @xmath5 .",
    "one way to destabilize such profiles comes from magnetic field action @xcite , which may arise from the dynamo in the disk or from the central object ( e.g.  a star ) . here",
    "we model the accretion disk flow with the taylor - couette setup , consisting of two co - rotating cylinders and conducting fluid between them , with applied azimuthal magnetic field .",
    "the rotation of the cylinders was fixed so that angular momentum increases but angular velocity decreases ( quasi - keplerian flow ) . in the absence of magnetic field angular momentum transport in this linearly stable flow is supported only by molecular effects ( viscosity ) . in the presence of external azimuthal magnetic field flow",
    "is destabilized via the so - called azimuthal magnetorotational instability ( amri ) , as shown by linear analysis of hollerbach et al .",
    "rdiger et al .",
    "@xcite studied the amri transport in taylor - couette system with direct numerical simulations for large magnetic prandtl numbers ( @xmath6 ) and moderate reynolds numbers @xmath7 .",
    "they found that the resulting turbulence contributes to the total angular momentum transport and they suggested that the turbulent viscosity scales as @xmath8 . in this work",
    "we compare the dynamics of the system at large @xmath3 and small @xmath4 of ingasn alloy , exploring wide range of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 for large and @xmath11 for small @xmath2 ) .",
    "first , we perform a linear stability analysis of the flow using the method of hollerbach et al .",
    "@xcite in order to define scalings of the instability borders and parameter paths of the maximum growth rates of perturbations .",
    "second , by performing direct numerical simulations we trace the transition to turbulence in the system .",
    "finally we estimate angular momentum transport with our nonlinear pseudo - spectral dns method , described in @xcite , which allows us to investigate both high and low @xmath2 with good accuracy .",
    "we consider an incompressible viscous conducting fluid that is sheared between two rotating cylinders .",
    "the velocity and magnetic field are determined by the mhd equations : @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the hartmann number , @xmath15 the magnetic prandtl number ( @xmath16 - density , @xmath17 - kinematic viscosity , @xmath18 - magnetic diffusivity , @xmath19 - electrical conductivity ) .",
    "these equations were non - dimensionalized with the following scales : the gap between cylinders @xmath20 , viscous time scale @xmath21 , external magnetic field of magnitude @xmath22 .",
    "reynolds number was defined with rotation of inner cylinder and the gap @xmath23 : @xmath24 .",
    "it does not appear explicitly in the equations , but it appears in the boundary conditions on the cylinders ( no - slip for velocity , insulating for magnetic field ) . in the axial direction",
    "periodic boundary conditions were used .",
    "the rotation rate @xmath25 together with the radius ratio @xmath26 defines the rotation regime . in the following we fix @xmath27 and @xmath28 resulting in a hydrodynamically stable flow in the absence of magnetic field ( according to the rayleigh criterion for stability @xmath29 @xcite ) .",
    "the imposed magnetic field @xmath30 is directed azimuthally .",
    "by linearizing the nonlinear equations ( [ eq : nseq]-[eq : ieq ] ) about the basic flow : @xmath31,\\ ] ] and imposed magnetic field @xmath32 and considering disturbances in the form of @xmath33 we can find the parameter regions where the real part of the growth rate @xmath34 $ ] is positive , and thus perturbations grow .",
    "the details of the method were described in [ 3 ] . in the case of amri",
    "the most unstable eigenmode is nonaxisymmetric ( @xmath35 for radius ratio @xmath28 ) .",
    "the axial wavenumber @xmath36 is also optimized so the most unstable mode is obtained .",
    "the instability maps for @xmath4 ( @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : stabmaps ] .",
    "the flow is unstable inside the marked regions .",
    "the smaller @xmath2 , the more the instability region is shifted upwards , and thus the faster the cylinders have to be rotated to observe instability ( @xmath40 for high @xmath2 case against @xmath41 for low @xmath2 ) .",
    "we found that the instability domain is divided into parameter regions where different linear modes of instability dominate . on the borders of these regions the most unstable axial wavenumber @xmath42 undergoes discontinuous jumps as @xmath43 is varied ( red dots on the fig .",
    "[ fig : axialwn ] ) , and , respectively , the growth rate changes slope ( solid black lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : axialwn ] ) . recording the parameter values of the jump @xmath44 , for @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stabmaps]a ) we distinguish the following instabilities : instability i ( ` basic instability ' which appears for both @xmath2 , in black ) , and instability iii , arising at high values of @xmath9 ( yellow line ) . for @xmath3 instability iii",
    "vanishes and instabilities ii ( red ) and v ( blue ) arise ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : stabmaps]b ) . for both large and small @xmath2",
    "the linear scaling of @xmath46 appears at the right border , but at @xmath38 it is extended with instability v ( blue region ) , with scaling of @xmath47 .",
    "the green points on fig .  [ fig : stabmaps ] correspond to the maximum growth rate line .",
    "each point of it marks @xmath43 where the real part of the eigenvalue of the fastest growing mode is maximal ( at fixed @xmath9 ) .",
    "guseva et al .",
    "@xcite found that for @xmath4 this point in the parameter space correlates nicely with the maximum in the torque at the cylinders for fixed @xmath9 .",
    "we follow this parameter path later with direct numerical simulations ( brown crosses on fig .  [",
    "fig : stabmaps ] ) , estimating an upper bound for transport intensity in this way .",
    "the linear stability analysis does not give any information about the final , saturated state of a system .",
    "fortunately , the critical parameters of @xmath48 and @xmath49 are accessible in liquid metal experiments .",
    "such experiments indeed have been performed with ingasn alloy ( @xmath45 ) @xcite .",
    "the amri was observed as a superposition of two waves , traveling in the opposite direction at slightly different speeds .",
    "this was surprising because the azimuthal magnetic field does not break the axial reflection symmetry of a taylor - couette system .",
    "it was shown numerically in @xcite , that with axially periodic boundary conditions at @xmath4 the amri arises as a standing wave ( i.e. stationary in axial direction ) , which at the same time rotates azimuthally approximately at the outer cylinder frequency .",
    "this wave arises via a supercritical hopf bifurcation from the laminar flow , where ( @xmath50 ) acts as a bifurcation parameter .",
    "however , the standing waves ( sw ) are stable only close to the onset of instability . at higher @xmath9",
    "a subsequent subcritical hopf bifurcation destabilizes sw and spatial defects accumulate in the system @xcite .",
    "more information on symmetries and bifurcation in fluid dynamics in general and taylor - couette flow in particular can be found in @xcite .",
    "( @xmath27 ) : standing waves , traveling waves , 2- and 1-frequency oscillations ( of the torque ) , chaotic solutions ( defects ) . oscillating in time solutions",
    "are stable .",
    "the different instability regions are shown as a reference .",
    "vertical dashed line represents the maximum growth rate line , horizontal dashed line - line of @xmath51 .",

    "in this work we studied the magnetorotational instability with applied azimuthal magnetic field in the taylor - couette setup ( amri ) .",
    "the focus was made on the comparison between two magnetic prandtl numbers : small @xmath4 and large @xmath3 .",
    "first , using the method of linear analysis , we found that the right border of instability scales as @xmath53 both for high and low @xmath2 .",
    "for large @xmath2 case the instability is widened up to @xmath54 , but the line @xmath53 remains as a line of discontinuous jump in the axial wavenumber .",
    "this jump shows the existence of additional instability modes defining the instability domain .",
    "the types of modes and their regions of existence are different for low and high @xmath2 .",
    "second , we followed the linear results with nonlinear direct numerical simulations .",
    "the amri arises first as a spatially periodic standing or travelling wave , and as the reynolds number increases the spatially periodic flow turns into turbulence . for low @xmath4",
    "this transition happens as a sequence of super- and subcritical hopf bifurcations @xcite , while for @xmath3 the transition scenario is much more complicated and involves several spatially complex flow patterns exhibiting 1- or 2-frequency oscillations of integral quantities such as torque or kinetic energy .",
    "this phenomenon does not seem to be connected to the existence of several types of modes found in the linear stability analysis of the flow , since it happens at low @xmath9 close to the onset of instability and does not touch the lines of discontinuous jump in axial wavenumber @xmath36 , predicted by linear analysis .",
    "the competition between several linear modes occurs in the parameter region where the flow is already too turbulent to observe remnants of the linear modes . following the maximum growth rate lines",
    ", we estimated the maximum angular momentum transport efficiency of amri up to @xmath55 for large @xmath2 and @xmath56 for low @xmath2 . at these values of @xmath9",
    "the flow becomes fully turbulent and the turbulent structures do not resemble low @xmath9 sw or tw . as an estimate for the turbulent transport values of torque at the cylinders were computed .",
    "again the small and large @xmath2 showed qualitatively different behavior . for @xmath4 torque scales as a function of @xmath9 as @xmath57 .",
    "large @xmath2 flows show much stronger transport enhancement and at @xmath58 the turbulent transport is already 16 times larger than the molecular ( laminar ) transport .",
    "these differences in small-@xmath2 and large-@xmath2 flow dynamics demonstrate the need for a study of intermediate @xmath2 for a better understanding of the transition between low- and high-@xmath2 transport properties ."
