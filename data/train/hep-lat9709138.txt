    "lattice nrqcd has been widely used in the past few years to calculate a variety of phenomenologically interesting quantities .",
    "the first step in the nrqcd program , naturally , is the calculation of the spectrum of the @xmath3 system . in the simulation presented here",
    "we use sesam s large sample of dynamical wilson - fermion gauge configurations to study both the spin - independent as well as the spin - dependent spectrum of the @xmath4 .",
    "our strategy , in searching for sea - quark effects , will be to compare our final dynamical results to that of a quenched simulation at equivalent lattice spacing . with our three sea - quark masses",
    "we can also study the dependence of mass - splittings on the light sea - quark mass .",
    "recent simulations have exposed the sensitivity of spin - independent splittings to the details of the action .",
    "therefore , in the spirit of @xcite , we have implemented the nrqcd action including spin - dependent corrections of @xmath1 and we tadpole improve using the mean link calculated in landau gauge . with these ingredients we hope to clarify the effect of unquenching in the spin - dependent splittings .",
    "in addition , using the quenched configurations we investigate : ( i ) the effect of changing tadpole prescriptions ; ( ii ) the effect of using an @xmath5 correct action compared to the @xmath1 corrected one .",
    "the non - relativistic ( euclidean ) lattice hamiltonian to @xmath6 consists of @xcite : the kinetic energy operator , @xmath7 which is of order @xmath8 ; relativistic corrections of order @xmath9 , @xmath10 and spin - sensitive corrections of order @xmath11 , @xmath12 the @xmath13 and @xmath14 fields are represented by the standard clover term or , where appropriate , by an improved version to remove @xmath15 discretization errors .",
    "following @xcite the quark greens functions are calculated from the evolution equation @xmath16 with @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "we rely on tapole improvement choosing the mean link in landau gauge as our improvement scheme .",
    "the coefficients @xmath18 are then set to their tree level value of 1 .",
    "the lattice parameters we have used are displayed in table [ simulation ] .",
    "details concerning the generation of our dynamical configurations and issues surrounding autocorrelations are discussed in ref .",
    "we exploit configurations more than once by starting the propagator evolution both at different spatial source points and on different timeslices .",
    "a binning procedure confirms that our 4 measurements per configuration are indeed independent .",
    "throughout , we fix the bare heavy quark mass to a value @xmath19 .",

    "for details concerning the choice of operators , smearing techniques and fitting procedures we refer to @xcite . we extrapolate energy level splittings linearly in the quark mass : @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the bare light quark masses(see figure [ chiral1 ] for an example ) .",
