    "the strong interaction , binding quarks and gluons inside hadrons , is the strongest of the four fundamental forces in nature which we know today .",
    "it is about 100 times stronger than the electromagnetic force , a factor of @xmath2 stronger than the weak interaction , and a stunning factor of @xmath3 stronger than the gravitational force , calculated for two quarks at a distance of order 1  fm .    in spite of these differences ,",
    "it is the gravitational and the electromagnetic forces which seem to play the dominating role in the universe which we experience in the macroscopic world .",
    "the reason for this wondrous fact is that the strong force , as well as the weak interaction , only acts at subatomic distances .",
    "taking the existence of atomic nuclei , their composition and their masses for granted , restricting ourselves to energies and temperatures below 1  mev and , respectively , @xmath4 kelvin , the strong interaction is disguised in the description of the world .",
    "at subatomic distances , however , this picture changes completely .",
    "the strong force not only determines the binding of quarks and gluons inside hadrons , it also determines the cohesion of protons and neutrons inside atomic nuclei .",
    "hadrons like protons and neutrons are responsible for more than 99% of the mass of all visible matter in our universe , and those masses are mainly generated by the strong binding of quarks inside hadrons , rather than by the ( generally small ) masses of the quarks themselves .",
    "the restriction of the strong force to subatomic distances is a consequence of two characteristic features : they are called confinement `` and asymptotic freedom '' .    confinement is a necessary requirement to explain the fact that no isolated quarks have ever been observed in any experiment , although symmetry arguments and scattering experiments in the 1960 s established quarks , with -1/3 or + 2/3 of electrical charge units and a newly introduced quantum property called `` colour charge '' , as the basic constituents of hadrons .",
    "confinement determines that at large distances , or - equivalently - at low momentum or energy transfer in elementary particle reactions , the strong force prevents the existence of free quarks : trying to separate two quarks from each other , for instance in high energy scattering reactions , apparently results in an increase of the force field s energy at large distances , such that new quarks are created out of the vacuum - the initial quarks dress \" up with other quarks to build hadrons . these hadrons exhibit no net colour charge to the outside , such that they appear as elementary entities rather than the quarks themselves .",
    "the term asymptotic freedom \" is used to describe the behaviour of quarks at high energy or momentum transfers , or - equivalently - at small distances . also this feature is based on experimental observations : in high energy scattering processes between leptons ( e.g. electrons or neutrinos ) with protons or neutrons , the dynamics reveal that scattering occurs at pointlike and massless constituents , the quarks , rather than at a homogenuous object with the size of a proton .",
    "apparently , at sufficiently high momentum transfers , quarks behave like free or weakly bound particles .",
    "also , quarks knocked out of a hadron , in a high energy scattering process , were never observed as free particles .",
    "instead , they emerge as dressed - up hadrons or bundles ( jets ) of hadrons escaping from the interaction region .",
    "the fact that the strong interaction becomes weak `` at high energy scales , and vanishes to zero at asymptotically high energies , led to the term asymptotic freedom '' . any theory describing and predicting the dynamics of quarks inside hadrons and in high energy reactions therefore had to satisfy and include these two extremes : confinement , also called infrared slavery \" , and asymptotic freedom .",
    "a theoretical description of the strong interaction by a consistent quantum field theory , called quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , was presented in 1972 by fritzsch and gell - mann @xcite , which was formaly published later in @xcite . at the same time",
    "it was found by gross , politzer and wilczek that non - abelian gauge theories , such as qcd , exhibit the propoerty of asymptotic freedom @xcite .",
    "this discovery was honored with the nobel price in 2004 , 30 years after the original findings .    theoretical breakthroughs and discoveries ,",
    "before being honored by the nobel price , must be established by experimental measurements .",
    "the price for asymptotic freedom therefore also had to await experimental verification .",
    "in this article , the long but exciting road to experimental evidence for asymptotic freedom shall be summarised .",
    "in the 1930 s , protons and neutrons were recognised as the building blocks of atomic nuclei . a new and elementary force , the so - called strong force ,",
    "was introduced phenomenologically , in order to explain the binding of these particles inside nuclei .",
    "these binding energies were known to be much larger than what could be expected from the well - known electromagnetic force . also , the electromagnetic force was known to have infinite range while the strong force apparently acted only within nuclear distances of the order of femtometer .    shortly after these perceptions",
    ", hideki yukawa argued that the range of the electromagnetic force was infinite because the associated exchange particle , the photon , was massless , and proposed that the short range of the strong force was due to the exchange of a massive particle which was called meson \" @xcite . from quantum mechanical arguments and from heisenberg s uncertainty principle",
    "yukawa predicted a meson mass , such that energies , momenta and masses are all given in units of ev . ] of about 100  mev / c@xmath5 .",
    "at that time , no particle with a mass in that range was known .",
    "very soon after , in 1937 , a new particle was dicovered whose mass was very close to that of yukawa s prediction of the meson - however , this particle in fact was the muon which turned out not to be subject to the strong interaction .",
    "finally , in 1947 strongly interacting particles with masses close to yukawa s prediction were found @xcite in emulsion experiments at high altitudes .",
    "a particle which met yukawa s requirements was found , and it was called pion \" .",
    "although today we know that pions , like protons and neutrons , are composite particles made from quarks , and the strong interaction is not mediated through the exchange of pions , yukawa s theory stimulated major advances in the understanding and description of the strong interaction .      in the decades after world war",
    "ii , the number of strongly interacting particles exploded - which was basically due to the development of particle accelerators with steadily increasing energies .",
    "strongly interacting particles were then called hadrons `` , which differentiate into mesons ( with integer or zero spins ) and baryons ( with spins of 1/2 or 3/2 ) .",
    "gell - mann and zweig realised in 1964 that the whole spectroscopy of hadrons could be explained by a small number of quarks '' if baryons are made out of 3 quarks , and mesons out of one quark plus one antiquark @xcite .",
    "those quarks , initially 3 different species , then must have 1/3 or 2/3 of the elementary charge unit , and they must have spin 1/2 .    by the end of the 1960 s , the static picture of quarks as the constituents of hadrons",
    "was confirmed through the dynamics observed at high energy electron - proton scattering experiments at the stanford linear accelerator ( slac)@xcite , summarised in figure  [ fig : slac ] : the cross sections - instead of decreasing with increasing momentum transfer as expected for elastic scattering of electrons at protons as a whole - showed a scaling \" behaviour , as it should occur if the electrons scatter on quasi - free , pointlike and nearly massless constituents inside the protons .",
    "14.0 cm    while the quark model was very successful in describing the properties , multitude and dynamic behaviour of hadrons , it had severe shortcomings such as an obvious violation of the pauli - principle for hadrons containing two or three identical quarks in relative s - waves and in identical spin states , the prediction of the neutral pion s lifetime which was wrong by a factor of nine , and the fact that no particles ( quarks ) with 1/3 or 2/3 of the elementary charge unit could ever be observed at particle colliders .      to overcome these shortcomings , the idea that the strong force couples to a new quantum poperty , called colour charge @xcite , in analogy to the photon in qed which couples to the electric charges .",
    "the introduction of the new quantum number , describing 3 different colour quantum states of each of the quark species , solved the puzzle of spin - statistics , saved the pauli - principle and explained the missing factor of nine ( @xmath6 ) of the pion lifetime . the notion that hadrons consist either of three quarks ( baryons like the proton ) or a quark and an antiquark ( mesons ) , arranged such that the net color charge of the hadron would vanish - i.e. white \" as a superposition of the three elementary color states or of a particular color and its anti - color - could account for the fact that the strong force is short - ranged .",
    "finally , in the early 1970 s , a field theory of the strong force , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , was introduced and presented in canonical form @xcite . here , coloured spin-1 particles called gluons \" , which - in contrast to the case of photons in qed - carry colour charge themselves , couple to the colour charges of quarks , and also to coloured gluons themselves .",
    "chromo - statics turned into chromo - dynamics .",
    "a few years before , it was demonstrated in model theories that charges may change their effective size when they are probed in scattering experiments , at large and at small distances .",
    "these changes were described through symanzik s @xmath7-function @xcite , see equation  2 below : the effective size of the coupling strength is a function of the energy or momentum transfer , @xmath8 .",
    "the slac data on approximate scaling of the proton structure function , c.f .",
    "figure  [ fig : slac ] , and the notion of free quarks inside the proton required a negative @xmath7-function . at that time , however , all field theories probed so far had a positive @xmath7-function .",
    "gross , politzer and wilczek finally demonstrated in 1973 that chromo - dynamics , with coloured quarks and gluons , obeying su(3)@xmath9 symmetry , generated a negative @xmath7-function @xcite , i.e. that quarks and gluons are asymptotically free .",
    "this explained the slac data , and at the same time leads - for small momentum transfers or at large distances , to an increase of the coupling strength , thus motivating confinement .",
    "another important consequence from asymptotic freedom is the fact that the strong coupling @xmath0 is small enough , at sufficiently large momentum transfers , to allow application of perturbation theory in order to provide quantitative predictions of physical processes .",
    "with this discovery quantum chromodynamics started its triumphal procession as being @xmath10 field theory of the strong interaction .",
    "it was , however , a long and difficult path before qcd was commonly accepted to be exactly that .",
    "many refined calculations , theoretical predictions and experimental verifications were ventured .",
    "the most important features of qcd , asymptotic freedom and/or , equivalently , the existence of colour charged gluons , had to be tested , quantified and proven \" by experiment .",
    "the size of the strong coupling parameter , @xmath11 , had to be determined and its energy dependence verified to be compatible with asymptotic freedom .",
    "the violation of approximate scaling of the proton structure function was one of the first experimental signatures proposed to test qcd @xcite .",
    "deep inelastic electron - proton ( or more generally , lepton - nucleon ) scattering processes basically depend on two kinematical parameters .",
    "the usual choice of these parameters are the momentum transfer @xmath8 between the lepton and the struck quark , and the fraction @xmath12 of the proton s momentum which is carried by the struck quark .",
    "the structure function @xmath13 of the proton basically parametrises the population of quarks with momentum fraction @xmath12 , as a function of @xmath8 : @xmath14 .",
    "qcd predicts that the region of large @xmath12 is depopulated for higher momentum transfers , while the population at low @xmath12 should increase with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "a simple argument for this behaviour can be given in terms of the equivalence of momentum transfer and physical resolution : with higher @xmath8 , smaller distances are probed . at smaller distances , an increased radiation of soft ( low energy ) gluons should be resolved .",
    "these gluons increase the population of partons at small @xmath12 , and - at the same time - diminish the momentum fraction and the relative contribution of quarks at large @xmath12 .    on top of it s kinematical origin , scaling violations in @xmath12 and @xmath15 are modified by the specific energy dependence of the strong coupling .",
    "note that a qualitative observation of scaling violations of structure functions alone does not yet prove asymptotic freedom - such a conclusion requires a large lever arm in @xmath8 and a precise study of the functional form of observed scaling violations , as e.g. the logarithmic slopes , @xmath16 .",
    "while scaling violations were already observed in the 1970 s , initially it was not possible to conclude that asymptotic freedom was actually seen @xcite . instead , unknown higher order qcd terms",
    ", the effects of target masses and nonperturbative effects ( higher twists \" ) could cause similar effects as those predicted by asymptotic freedom . only with the availability of much higher @xmath8 and the ability to probe much smaller values of @xmath12 , e.g. at the electron - proton collider hera , stricter conclusions were possible in the past 10 to 15 years .",
    "these will be presented in more detail in section  5 .",
    "another class of predictions , basically governed by the concept of confinement , was the expectation of collimated hadron jets in high energy reactions like @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "indeed , by 1975 , the emergence of 2-jet structure was observed when increasing the @xmath18 center of mass energy @xmath19 from 3 to 7.4  gev @xcite , confirming the basic ideas of the quark - parton model .",
    "the radiation of energetic gluons off high energetic quarks was predicted from qcd , and hence the emergence of a third hadron jet was expected in @xmath18 annihilation at higher energies @xcite . in 1979 ,",
    "3-jet structures were observed at the petra @xmath18 collider at @xmath20  gev @xcite , see figure  [ fig:3-jet ] .",
    "the @xmath21 jet could be attributed to the emission of a third parton with zero electric charge and spin  1 @xcite  the gluon was discovered and explicitly seen !    12.0 cm    after an almost parameter - free description of hadronic event shapes @xcite had served to establish gluon radiation beyond any doubts , first determinations of the coupling strength @xmath0 were performed .",
    "more detailed studies of the jet structure and the shape of hadronic events provided insights into the color structure of the gluon , like for instance the string effect \" @xcite which was expected in qcd due to the higher color charge of the gluon @xcite .      towards the end of the 1980 s , after successful exploitation of the experimental programs of the @xmath18 storage rings petra at desy and pep at slac , the proton - antiproton collider at cern and many deep inelastic lepton - nucleon experiments at cern , at fermilab and at slac , \" @xcite , however convincing @xmath22 of the key features of qcd , of the gluon - selfcoupling and/or of asymptotic freedom , were still not available . as an example , the summary of measurements of @xmath0 at different energy scales in 1989 , as reproduced in figure  [ fig : as89 ] @xcite , was compatible with the qcd expectation of the running of @xmath0 , but did not yet allow to draw more concrete conclusions .",
    "12.0 cm    foundations were layed , however , to prepare for more quantitative tests with the upcoming higher energy colliders , like the @xmath18 colliders lep at cern and slc at slac , the tevatron @xmath23 collider at fermilab and the hera electron - proton collider at desy , who all started operation in the time from 1987 to 1991 :    * from the summary of @xmath0 measurements shown in figure  [ fig : as89 ] , using the qcd prediction of a running coupling , the value of @xmath24 , at the energy scale of the @xmath25 boson mass , @xmath26gev , was predicted to be @xmath27 .",
    "experiments at lep and slc were determined to scrutinise this prediction with high accuracy @xcite . * deep inelastic scattering results ,",
    "extending to much higher values of @xmath15 and much lower values of @xmath12 , should proove scaling violations of nucleon structure functions . * significant progress in jet physics allowed to prepare for direct tests of asymptotic freedom , through the energy dependence of jet production rates @xcite , and of the gluon - selfcoupling , through spin - correlations in 4-jet hadronic final states in @xmath18 annihilation @xcite . *",
    "precise determinations of @xmath0 at low and at high energy scales , in @xmath18 annihilation , at hadron colliders and in deep inelastic lepton - nucleon collisions were expected to emerge , with the prospect of proving the energy dependence of @xmath0 , and thus , asymptotic freedom . *",
    "theoretical developments like precise calculations in next - to - leading ( nlo ) and next - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) pertubation theory , advanced methods of handling theoretical uncertainties , and improvement in the understanding of the nonperturbative hadronisation process , in terms of advanced monte carlo models , had started and were expected to be confronted with future high precision experimental data .",
    "after a short summary of the theoretical basics of qcd in section  3 , the developments of experimental test of qcd , and in particular of asymptotic freedom , following the status as summarised above , will be presented in more detail in sections 4 to 6 .",
    "the concepts of qcd are portrayed in many text books and articles , se e.g. @xcite , and in particular , the article of g.m.prosperi , m. raciti and c.simolo in this issue of ppnp @xcite . in the following , a brief summary of the basics of perturbative qcd and of the energy dependent strong coupling parameter , @xmath0 , is given .",
    "in quantum field theories like quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , physical quantities @xmath28 can be expressed by a perturbation series in powers of the coupling parameter @xmath0 or @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "if these couplings are sufficiently small , i.e. if @xmath30 , the series may converge sufficiently quickly such that it provides a realistic prediction of @xmath28 even if only a limited number of perturbative orders will be known .    in qcd ,",
    "examples of such quantities are cross sections , decay rates , jet production rates or hadronic event shapes .",
    "consider @xmath28 being dimensionless and depending on @xmath0 and on a single energy scale @xmath31 .",
    "this scale shall be larger than any other relevant , dimensional parameter such as quark masses . in the following , these masses",
    "are therefore set to zero .    when calculating @xmath28 as a perturbation series of a pointlike field theory in @xmath0 , ultraviolet divergencies occur .",
    "these divergencies are removed by the renormalisation \" of a small set of physical parameters .",
    "fixing these parameters at a given scale and absorbing this way the ultraviolet divergencies , introduces a second but artificial momentum or energy scale @xmath32 . as a consequence of this procedure ,",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath0 become functions of the renormalization scale @xmath32 . since @xmath28 is dimensionless , we assume that it only depends on the ratio @xmath33 and on the renormalized coupling @xmath34 : @xmath35    because the choice of @xmath32 is arbitrary , however , the actual value of the experimental observable @xmath28 can not depend on @xmath32 , so that    @xmath36    where the derivative is multiplied with @xmath37 in order to keep the expression dimensionless .",
    "equation  [ eq - muindependence ] implies that any explicite dependence of @xmath28 on @xmath32 must be cancelled by an appropriate @xmath32-dependence of @xmath0 to all orders .",
    "it would therefore be natural to identify the renormalization scale with the physical energy scale of the process , @xmath38 , eliminating the uncomfortable presence of a second and unspecified scale . in this case",
    ", @xmath0 transforms to the running coupling constant \" @xmath11 , and the energy dependence of @xmath28 enters only through the energy dependence of @xmath11 .    any residual @xmath32-dependence is a measure of the quality of a given calculation in finite perturbative order .",
    "while qcd does not predict the absolute size of @xmath0 , its energy dependence is precisely determined .",
    "if @xmath39 is measured at a given scale , qcd definitely predicts its size at any other energy scale @xmath15 through the renormalization group equation @xmath40 the perturbative expansion of the @xmath7 function is calculated to complete 4-loop approximation @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the number of active quark flavours at the energy scale @xmath31 .",
    "the numerical constants in equation  [ eq - betas ] are functions of the group constants @xmath44 and @xmath45 , for theories exhibiting @xmath46 symmetry ; for qcd and @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . @xmath50 and @xmath51 are independent of the renormalization scheme , while all higher order @xmath7 coefficients are scheme dependent .",
    "a solution of equation  [ eq - rge ] in 1-loop approximation , i.e. neglecting @xmath51 and higher order terms , is @xmath52 apart from giving a relation between the values of @xmath0 at two different energy scales @xmath15 and @xmath37 , equation  [ eq - as1loop ] also demonstrates the property of asymptotic freedom : if @xmath8 becomes large and @xmath50 is positive , i.e. if @xmath53 , @xmath11 will asymptotically decrease to zero .",
    "likewise , equation  [ eq - as1loop ] indicates that @xmath11 grows to large values and , in this perturbative form , actually diverges to infinity at small @xmath15 : for instance , with @xmath54 and for typical values of @xmath55 , @xmath11 exceeds unity for @xmath56 .",
    "clearly , this is the region where perturbative expansions in @xmath0 are not meaningful anymore , and we may regard energy scales below the order of 1  gev as the nonperturbative region where confinement sets in , and where equations  [ eq - rge ] and  [ eq - as1loop ] can not be applied .    including @xmath51 and higher order terms , similar but more complicated relations for @xmath11 , as a function of @xmath34 and of @xmath57 as in equation  [ eq - as1loop ] , emerge",
    "they can be solved numerically , such that for a given value of @xmath34 , choosing a suitable reference scale like the mass of the @xmath25 boson , @xmath58 , @xmath11 can be accurately determined at any energy scale @xmath59 .",
    "if we set @xmath60 a dimensional parameter @xmath61 is introduced such that equation  [ eq - as1loop ] transforms into @xmath62 hence , the @xmath61 parameter is technically identical to the energy scale @xmath31 where @xmath11 diverges to infinity , @xmath63 for @xmath64 . to give a numerical example , @xmath65  gev for @xmath66 and @xmath43 = 5 .",
    "the parametrization of the running coupling @xmath11 with @xmath61 instead of @xmath39 has become a common standard , see e.g.  @xcite , and will also be adopted here .",
    "while being a convenient and well - used choice , however , this parametrization has several subtleties :    first , requiring that @xmath11 must be continuous when crossing a quark threshold rather than @xmath0 must be continuous , which may lead to small discontinuities in @xmath11 at quark thresholds in finite order perturbation theory ; see section  3.7 .",
    "] , @xmath61 actually depends on the number of active quark flavours .",
    "secondly , @xmath61 depends on the renormalization scheme , see e.g. reference @xcite . in this review , the so - called modified minimal subtraction scheme \" ( @xmath67 ) @xcite",
    "will be adopted , which also has become a common standard  @xcite .",
    "@xmath61 will therefore be labelled @xmath68 to indicate these peculiarities .",
    "12.0 cm      in complete 4-loop approximation and using the @xmath61-parametrization , the running coupling is thus given @xcite by @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "the first line of equation  [ eq - as4loop ] includes the 1- and the 2-loop coefficients , the second line is the 3-loop and the third line is the 4-loop correction , respectively .",
    "12.0 cm    the functional form of @xmath71 , for 4 different values of @xmath72 between 50  mev and 350 mev , is diplayed in figure  [ fig : asq-4l](a ) .",
    "the slope and dependence on the actual value of @xmath72 is especially pronounced at small @xmath8 , while at large @xmath8 both the energy dependence and the dependence of @xmath72 becomes increasingly feeble .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath0 decreases with increasing energy scale and tends to zero at asymptotically high @xmath8 .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : asq-4l](b ) , where @xmath11 is plotted as a function of @xmath73 .",
    "any experimental proof of asymptotic freedom will therefore require precise determinations of @xmath0 , or of other observables which depend on @xmath11 , in a possibly large range of energy scales .",
    "this range should include as small as possible energies , since the relative energy dependence is largest there . to date ,",
    "precise experimental data and respective qcd analyses are available in the range of @xmath74  gev to a few hundred gev .",
    "the importance of higher order loop corrections and the degree of convergence of the perturbative expansion for the running @xmath0 , see equation  [ eq - as4loop ] , is analysed and demonstrated in figure  [ fig : asq - orders ] . in part",

    "only the 1-loop approximation shows sizeable differences of up to several per cent , in the energy and parameter range chosen , while the 2- and 3-loop approximation already reproduce the energy dependence of the best , i.e. 4-loop , prediction quite accurately .",
    "so far in this discussion , finite quark masses @xmath82 were neglected , assuming that both the physical and the renormalization scales @xmath15 and @xmath37 , respectively , are larger than any other relevant energy or mass scale involved in the problem .",
    "this is , however , not entirely correct , since there are several qcd studies and @xmath0 determinations at energy scales around the charm- and bottom - quark masses of about 1.5 and 4.7  gev , respectively .",
    "finite quark masses may have two major effects on actual qcd studies : firstly , quark masses will alter the perturbative predictions of observables @xmath28 . while phase space effects which are introduced by massive quarks can often be studied using hadronization models and monte carlo simulation techniques , explicit quark mass corrections in higher than leading perturbative order are available only for very few observables .",
    "secondly , any quark - mass dependence of @xmath28 will add another term @xmath83 to equation  [ eq - muindependence ] , which leads to energy - dependent , running quark masses , @xmath84 , in a similar way as the running coupling @xmath85 was obtained .",
    "in addition to these effects , @xmath0 indirectly also depends on the quark masses , through the dependence of the @xmath7 coefficients on the effective number of quarks flavours , @xmath43 , with @xmath86 .",
    "constructing an effective theory for , say , ( @xmath43 - 1 ) quark flavours which must be consistent with the @xmath43 quark flavours theory at the heavy quark threshold @xmath87 , results in matching conditions for the @xmath0 values of the ( @xmath43 - 1)- and the @xmath43-quark flavours theories @xcite .    in leading and in next - to - leading order ,",

    "those results obtained in ranges of @xmath31 and given , in table  [ tab : astab ] , as @xmath201 only , are not included in this figure - with one exception : the results from jet production in deep inelastic scattering are represented in table  [ tab : astab ] by one line , averaging over a range in @xmath31 from 6 to 100  gev , while in figure  [ fig : asq-2006 ] combined results for fixed values of @xmath31 as presented in @xcite are displayed .",
    "the data are compared with the qcd prediction for the running @xmath0 , calculated for @xmath209 which - as will be discussed in the next subsection - is the new world average .",
    "the qcd curves are calculated using the 4-loop perturbative prediction , equation  [ eq - as4loop ] , and 3-loop quark threshold matching , see section  3.6 .",
    "the data are in excellent agreement with the qcd prediction , from the smallest to the largest energy scales probed by experimental data .    10.0 cm    in order to demonstrate the significance with which the data probe asymptotic freedom , some of the most precise @xmath0 results are plotted from @xmath18 event shapes and jets at lep - ii , for ( @xmath31  = 189  gev ) , from 4-jet events at lep ( @xmath210  gev ) , from the reanalysis of @xmath18 event shapes and jets at petra ( @xmath211  gev ) , from hadron masses and lattice theory at @xmath212  gev , from heavy quarkonia decays at @xmath213  gev , and for @xmath128-decays at @xmath214  gev . ] in figure  [ fig : as06-logq ] , now as a function of the inverse logarithm of @xmath31 . also shown in this figure",
    "is the qcd prediction in 4-loop approximation including 3-loop quark threshold matching , for @xmath215 ( full line ) , and , for demonstration only , the 4-loop qcd curve omitting quark threshold matching .    the data very significantly prove the particular qcd prediction of asymptotic freedom .",
    "apart from precisely reproducing the characteristic qcd - shape with an inverse logarithmic slope , the data point at the very lowest energies , i.e. the right - most point in figure  [ fig : as06-logq ] , indicates that the available precision allows to conclude that quark threshold matching is necessary for qcd to consistently describe the data .",
    "in fact , data precision is now so advanced that a rather simple qcd fit , e.g. in leading order qcd with no threshold matching , with a fit probability of less than 1% , fails to describe data coefficient of the qcd beta - function , c.f .",
    "equation  [ eq - betafunction ] , or - alternatively - the number of colour degrees of freedom , @xmath216 . ] . evidently , the probabilities for a hypothetical _ constant _ and energy @xmath217dependent @xmath0 , or an abelian vector gluon theory which predicts an @xmath217crease of the coupling with increasing energy scale , c.f .",
    "figure  [ fig : r3 - 08 ] , have negligible probabilities to describe data .",
    "the same is true for other functional forms , like @xmath218 or @xmath219 - such functions may be adjusted such that they can describe a few data points either at low or at high values of @xmath31 , but altogether fail to describe data in the full range of energy scales from 1.78 to 200 gev .",
    "therefore , it is concluded that the data , with the current precision which has substantially increased over the past few years , prove the specific qcd functional form of the running coupling @xmath0 , and therefore of asymptotic freedom .      since all measurements of @xmath0 , as shown in figure  [ fig : asq-2006 ] , are consistent with the running coupling",
    "as predicted by qcd , it is legitimate to evolve all values of @xmath71 to a common reference energy scale , like e.g. @xmath206 , using the qcd 4-loop beta - function .",
    "this was already done in the past , see e.g. @xcite , and world average values of @xmath201 were determined .",
    "a general difficulty in the averaging procedure is the proper and optimal treatment of errors and uncertainties . for many of the results ,",
    "the dominating error is the theoretical uncertainty - which however is not uniquely defined , and is treated quite differently in most of the studies . while in a majority of analyses the theoretical uncertainty is defined through a variation of the renormalisation scale , the range of this variation is not unique .",
    "theoretical errors , in some studies , are defined and probed in a rather restrictive and optimistic way , while in other studies they are treated in a more generous manner .",
    "also , theoretical uncertainties are likely to be correlated between different analyses , however to an unknown degree . so the assigned errors can not be treated like statistical and independent errors .    in previous studies",
    "@xcite , an error - weighted average and an optimised correlation \" was calculated from the error covariance matrix , assuming an overall correlation factor between the errors of the measurements included in the averaging process .",
    "this factor was adjusted such that the overall @xmath220 equals unity per degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "usually the overall @xmath220 was larger than unity per d.o.f . , which indicated that either the individual errors were overestimated , or they were correlated .",
    "adjusting an overall correlation factor should take care about the latter case .",
    "the procedure , applied in a previous study to all results which are based on nnlo qcd and which have overall errors of @xmath221 on @xmath201 , then resulted in @xmath200 @xcite . here",
    ", the averaging shall be done using the same method , however the selection of results to be included in the final average shall be altered :    first , the restriction to results which are complete to nnlo will give a strong weight to studies at low energy scales , because most of the results obtained at high energies are in nlo , possibly including resummation , only .",
    "second , it may be time to include the results from lattice gauge calculations , which now have reached a maturity which may be comparable to those in ( nnlo ) perturbation theory - and lattice gauge results are most likely @xmath222 correlated with classical perturbation theory , thereby adding an independent input to the standard selection .",
    "finally , in order to reach a higher degree of independence between the results included in the averaging procedure , data from different processes should be chosen , avoiding a possible bias towards any direction . in this sense ,",
    "the precise determinations of @xmath0 from 4-jet events in @xmath18 annihilation at @xmath223 , from event shapes and jets at @xmath224  gev and from jets in deep inelastic scatterin are also chosen to be included .",
    "follwing this strategy , 10 results are henceforth selected to be included in the averaging procedure .",
    "they are summarised in table  [ tab : assel ] and average to @xmath225 with an overall @xmath220 of 9.9 for 9 degrees of freedom . since the @xmath220 is larger than unity per d.o.f .",
    ", no common correlation factor needs to be assumed ; in fact , in order to reach exactly 1 per d.o.f . , the assigned errors of single measurements should be increased , a method which is frequently used e.g. in @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the fact that - in contrast to the case of previous reviews , see e.g. @xcite - @xmath226 is not smaller than unity is mainly caused by two of the updates which were discussed above , namely by the new assessment of @xmath128 decays and from heavy hadron masses in lattice theory .",
    "both have the smallest overall errors assigned - @xmath227 on @xmath201 . treating these as gaussian and independent errors , the two results are 2.7 standard deviations apart from each other .",
    "the question whether one or both of these measurements has underestimated its assigned overall uncertainty can not finally be answered .",
    "the significance of each of the 10 selected measurements can be judged from the last column of table  2 , which shows the deviation of the respective average value of @xmath201 when @xmath228 this particular measurement in the averaging procedure .",
    "the maximum deviation observed is @xmath229 , a value which is compatible with a total error of @xmath230 .",
    "the largest change in @xmath220 is observed when the result from @xmath128 decays is left out - a possible hint for an underestimation of its assigned error .",
    "leaving out @xmath231 of the 10 selected measurements when averaging the results gives values of @xmath201 which vary between 0.1173 and 0.1205 ; these two extremes again average to 0.1189 with a maximum deviation of 0.0016 .    in view of these studies and variations ,",
    "it is finally concluded that @xmath232 is the new world average being slightly larger than 1 per d.o.f .",
    "] of @xmath0 . here , the overall error decreased by almost a factor of three as compared to the previous review @xcite .",
    "this small error , however , appears to be realistic since all measurements agree well with this new average , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : asq-2006 ] : the error band is very narrow , but all the data are consistent with this result .",
    "we have therefore reached , after 30 years of qcd , the case that not only asymptotic freedom is proven , beyond any doubts , by the data , but also that @xmath201 is now known very precisely , to better than 1% accuracy !",
    "the concept of asymptotic freedom , i.e. the qcd prediction of an inverse logarithmic decrease of the coupling strength @xmath0 with the energy or the momentum transfer in high energy scattering reactions , was shown to be significantly and reliably verified by a number of different measurements .",
    "historically , the first signatures for asymptotic freedom came from the observation of approximate scaling of structure functions in deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering experiments , and the subsequent observation of small scaling violations , in a manner as was predicted by qcd . before specific measurements of @xmath0 at different energy scales and processes were precise enough to proove the running of @xmath0 , measurements of the energy dependence of jet production rates in @xmath18 annihilations provided strong evidence for the energy dependence of @xmath0 , as predicted by qcd and by the concept of asymptotic freedom .",
    "the process of gluon self - coupling was experimentally established by studies of angular correlations within 4-jet final states , and the su(3 ) gauge structure of qcd was confirmed by studies of 4-jet and event shape observables at the lep @xmath18 collider .",
    "measurements of @xmath0 , performed by single experiments over ranges of energy scales , demonstrate evidence for the running of @xmath0 , in perfect agreement with qcd .",
    "studies by single ( or by few but similar ) experiments avoid systematic uncertainties which vary from ( energy ) point to point , and therefore have the potential to demonstrate asymptotic freedom , however , in most cases only over a limited range of energies .",
    "examples of such studies , as @xmath0 from jet production in deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering , @xmath0 from 4-jet event production in @xmath18 annihilation , are presented and discussed in this review .",
    "the most significant experimental proof of asymptotic freedom today is provided by the summary and combination of all measurements of @xmath0 , over an energy range of 1.6 gev to more than 200 gev , from all available processes and experiments , involving perturbative and lattice qcd calculations .",
    "the results are in excellent agreement with qcd and precisely reproduce the inverse logarithmic dependence of @xmath0 from the energy or momentum transfer scale @xmath31 .",
    "the data proove the neccessity to include higher loop diagrams in the perturbative prediction of the energy dependence of @xmath0 , and demonstrate the need for quark flavour threshold matching of @xmath0 , again as predicted by qcd .",
    "since all measurements of @xmath0 are in excellent agreement with asymptotic freedom as predicted by qcd , the results are elvolved , according to the qcd 4-loop beta - function , to a common energy scale @xmath233 .",
    "a set of significant and precise measurements , well balanced over all available processe , energies , experiments and theoretical methods , result in a new and improved world average value of @xmath234 the overall uncertainty of this result is improved by almost a factor of 3 , compared to the previous average presented in 2004 .",
    "this improvement will have significant implications on verifying the grand unification of forces , and in particular , on possible signatures for supersymmetry see e.g. @xcite . the improvement is achieved by the inclusion of several new results and updates , like the one from @xmath128 decays , from 4-jet final states in @xmath18 annihilations at lep , and from lattice predictions of heavy hadron masses .",
    "the total uncertainties of these new results are in the range of 1  to  2  % only , and therefore these measurements largely dominate the determination of the world average . although some of the quoted uncertainties may be underestimated , no significant disagreement between any of the measurements nor with the world average value of @xmath201 was found .",
    "future prospects for precise determinations of @xmath0 are upcoming qcd calculations , in nnlo perturbation theory , for more observables and processes , which will replace the currently used calculations in nlo or in resummed nlo , see e.g. table  [ tab : astab ] .",
    "such calculations are in preparation by several groups , see e.g. @xcite , and the results are eagerly awaited by experimentalists .",
    "it is hoped that application of these new nnlo calculations will provide an increased number of precise @xmath0 determinations , with overall errors of the order of 1% .",
    "this will provide the means for precise compatibility checks and for further improvements of the world average value of @xmath0 .",
