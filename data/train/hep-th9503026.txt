    "the perturbative renormalization of the non linear @xmath1-model @xcite gives rise to a deformation of the metric according to the ( one  loop ) equation @xmath4 this second order non linear partial differential equation ( pde ) has been studied in the simplest case of 2-dimensional target manifolds in ref .",
    "a whole family of solutions is known for the topology of the sphere @xmath5 or for the torus . in this letter",
    "we consider the case of @xmath5 only , but our method is easily adapted to the toroidal case . as is well known we can introduce local coordinates @xmath6 in such a way that the metric is conformally flat : @xmath7 and the rg equation valid to all loop reduces to a single non linear pde , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the exact @xmath10function and @xmath11\\ ] ] is the scalar curvature .",
    "a family of solutions in the case of one  loop , namely @xmath12 has been presented in @xcite .",
    "these can be obtained starting from the _ ansatz _ @xmath13\\ ; .\\ ] ] the only solutions of this kind which can be extended to @xmath14 ( uv limit ) without encountering singularities and which exibits a residual @xmath2 symmetry are the so - called _ sausage _ solutions , parametrized by a single real constant @xmath15 : @xmath16\\ ; , \\quad    b(t)=\\frac{\\nu}{2\\sinh\\left[\\frac\\nu{2\\pi}(t_0-t)\\right ] } \\ ; .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these trajectories in the space of all metrics are believed to be the one  loop approximation of some integrable deformation of the costant  curvature trajectory ( @xmath0 @xmath1-model ) , to which they tend as @xmath17 . to discuss the general solution of the rg equation we have to construct a numerical integration algorithm .",
    "the first problem is posed by the divergence of the conformal factor as @xmath18 : @xmath19 as @xmath18 . this general property ( which follows directly from gauss  bonnet theorem ) causes the factor @xmath20 to diverge , hence amplifying the numerical error of the differential term at large @xmath21 . to overcome this difficulty we introduce a background field @xmath22 , and we consider the equation for the shifted field @xmath23 .",
    "the background field is conveniently chosen as the constant curvature solution @xmath24 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where according to the rg equation @xmath25 satisfies @xmath26 introducing a new evolution parameter ( `` time '' ) @xmath27 , defined by @xmath28 the rg equation expressed in terms of the shifted field @xmath29 reads @xmath30 with @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the standard @xmath33invariant laplacean on the sphere .",
    "the original time scale can be simply recovered by quadratures @xmath34 at this stage we restrict our attention to @xmath35symmetric solutions @xmath36 .",
    "at this point it is convenient to adopt the standard spherical coordinates by letting @xmath37 . to get a good accuracy in the evaluation of the laplacean we apply the spectral method , that is we expand @xmath29 in legendre polynomials @xmath38 , which are the eigenfunctions of @xmath39 .",
    "thus , we developed the following finite  dimensional implementation of the standard expansion in legendre polynomials .",
    "let @xmath40 be the zeroes of the @xmath41-th legendre polynomial @xmath42 ; we adopt @xmath43 as our finite grid , such as the sausage solutions , can be studied by a restriction to even  order polynomials ; our algorithm can be easily adapted to this case , with a gain of a factor four in memory requirements ] and sample the field @xmath44 at the image points @xmath45 .",
    "+ the finite legendre expansion is then realized as follows : @xmath46 where @xmath47 are the gaussian integration weights @xcite for legendre polynomials .",
    "this finite expansion allows us to represent the laplacean _ exactly _ on polynomials of degree less than @xmath41 , since the coefficients @xmath48 are exact in this case .",
    "the lack of a fast implementation analogous to fft limits our algorithm in practice to @xmath49 on current workstations , but this proves to be adequate for our purposes .    having determined the finite transform @xmath50 on the basis of legendre polynomials , the action of the laplacean @xmath39 is represented by a matrix @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is diagonal , with eigenvalues @xmath53 . in terms of this representation is quite easy to compute the spectrum of zero  modes of the field @xmath54 , a problem considered in ref .",
    "we just have to diagonalize the finite matrix @xmath55 , where @xmath56 .",
    "the results agree with the previously computed ones for the sausages @xcite ( notice however that the present method is much simpler and the spectrum can be computed in parallel with the rg evolution ) .    with the finite legendre ",
    "transform algorithm at hand , we can now consider the integration of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rgeq ] ) .",
    "we can work to any loop , provided we know the corresponding @xmath10function .",
    "we have implemented the algorithm in matlab @xcite which provides efficient routines of dia  -go  -nalization and of adaptive - step integration .",
    "the accuracy of the code has been tested on the known one  loop sausage solution , attaining a typical maximal deviation of @xmath57 part in @xmath58 over a time interval @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in fig.1",
    "we show a typical one  loop sausage evolution ; to aid the visualization we have recovered the embedding of the surface in @xmath61 in such a way that the induced metric coincides with @xmath62 . the accuracy is limited essentially from the large eigenvalues of the laplacean which grow as the square of the finite grid dimension .",
    "moreover as @xmath15 and/or @xmath63 increase the curvature tends to be confined at the extremities of the sausage , which requires finer and finer grid . presently , up to @xmath64 points , we can not go beyond @xmath65 for @xmath66 , but there is no limit in principle .",
    "the algorithm can now be applied to investigate , at one  loop , the existence of _ attracting manifolds _ , in the space of all metrics . a conjecture of fateev and zamolodchikov states that the sausages constitute a stable manifold and all other geometries converge to some sausage , parametrized by the real @xmath15 , in the ir direction @xmath67 .",
    "+ this fact manifests itself quite clearly in our numerical data . we may define a distance function by @xmath68 ^ 2\\ ] ] and measure the distance to the sausage hypersurface by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the sausage solution specified by @xmath15 .",
    "the data show a clear exponential decay @xmath71 , with @xmath72 regardless of the initial surface ( see tab.1 ) . for",
    "any given starting geometry we record the value @xmath73 where the infimum is reached ; its limit @xmath74 as @xmath67 gives a definition of _ sausageness _ of any given surface .",
    "for instance , given an ellipsoid with cylindrical symmetry and eccentricity @xmath75 we can measure @xmath76 , at one  loop order ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "this shows a remarkable property : @xmath75 is a universal function of @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the starting scale of the evolution .",
    "this function seems to be @xmath79 , at least for small @xmath80 . +",
    "another way to discuss the attracting nature of the sausage manifold is to study the jacobi variational equations around the sausage solution .",
    "the linearized equations take on the following form ( calling @xmath81 the variation ) : @xmath82 where @xmath83 the spectrum of @xmath84 is not _ a priori _ of much significance , since the evolution equations are time  dependent . however ,",
    "if we rely on the adiabatic approximation , the spectrum is directly related to stability . applying the finite legendre ",
    "transform @xmath50 the spectrum of @xmath84 is easily reduced to that of a hermitean matrix ; choosing for @xmath29 some sausage @xmath70 we find a single positive eigenvalue denoting an unstable mode . as we presently show ,",
    "this is easily interpreted .",
    "+ it is immediate to find that the jacobi variational equation at one loop : @xmath85 admits the two solutions @xmath86 their existence is not surprising : the family of sausage solutions ( [ salsfam ] ) depends on two parameters @xmath87 and @xmath15 , so that the derivatives with respect to @xmath87 and @xmath15 give rise to two independent solutions of the variational equations .",
    "now @xmath88 , which comes from the time derivative represents the unstable solution ; this kind of instability is of no concern , since it corresponds to a simple redefinition of the initial time parameter @xmath87 and it can be fixed by restricting to a given initial area .",
    "the other solution @xmath89 comes from the @xmath90derivative and is tangent to the manifold of sausages .",
    "the component of a generic variation @xmath81 which is orthogonal to both @xmath88 and @xmath89 provides a measure of the distance of a generic solution from the sausage manifold .",
    "+ numerical results ( tab.2 and 3 ) show that the orthogonal part is exponentially decreasing with a slope ( @xmath91 ) . ]",
    "much higher than the slope of @xmath89 , which from equation ( [ varsals ] ) is found to be 2 .",
    "the point is that there is an overall convergence in the infrared toward the constant curvature metric .",
    "all sausages converge to a sphere with vanishing radius , forcing the decay of the mode @xmath89 ; however , the rate of this convergence is slower than the rate of decay of all other modes .",
    "fig.3 shows how the longitudinal component ( plotted in the vertical direction ) is stil large when the transversal one is already negligible . in fig.4",
    "there is an impressive , though only qualitative proof of what we found ( one should compare fig.4 with fig.1 , where the sausage evolution is plotted ) .",
    "conversely , the evolution in the ultraviolet direction @xmath92 is strongly unstable , which makes it quite hard to follow numerically ; all truncation errors are chaotically amplified and the calculation becomes rapidly unreliable .",
    "in ref . @xcite the model corresponding to @xmath35symmetric , one  loop deformation of the @xmath0 sigma model ( termed @xmath3 model ) is associated with a @xmath35symmetric deformation of the @xmath0 fst . to test the correctness of the identification ,",
    "some physical quantities calculated from @xmath93-matrix data via thermodynamic bethe ansatz tecniques are compared in the uv region with the corresponding quantities obtained perturbatively from the one  loop sausage action @xmath94 their non  trivial matching is a strong ( though indirect ) proof of the correctness of the association .    however , while for the fst we have exact ( at least in principle ) results , for the field theory we are strongly limited by the fact that the `` sausage metric '' is a solution to the rg equation _ only to one  loop_. so , it would be very important to have higher  loop solutions of the rg equation with the same features of the sausage , so to confirm ( or deny ) the validity of the association proposed in @xcite .",
    "this is not to be taken for granted . to any relativistic fst",
    "one would like to associate an integrable qft ; however , even if one assumes that the action ( [ eq : sausaction ] ) is the one  loop approximation of an exact trajectory of the rg group , which would define the _ exact _ sausage model , there is no _ a prori _ reason to expect such model to be integrable . in particular",
    ", @xmath5 with any @xmath2-symmetric metric _ is not _ a symmetric space and one can not use the results of refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite to establish the classical and/or quantum integrability of the model .",
    "considering the zero  temperature free energy @xmath95 in the presence of a constant external field @xmath96 , the one  loop calculation based on the action ( [ eq : sausaction ] ) gives the result @xcite @xmath97 where @xmath98 , @xmath52 is a subtraction scale and one works in the `` scaling limit '' : @xmath99 this limit serves to eliminate all higher  loops contributions , which can not be properly taken into account using the one  loop action ( [ eq : sausaction ] ) . to obtain higher",
    " loop correction to ( [ eq : freeenergy ] ) one needs the corresponding higher ",
    "loop solution of the rg equation .",
    "formula ( [ eq : freeenergy ] ) however remains valid , assuming as natural that the higher  loop action is an even , convex function of @xmath96 .    with our algorithm , the quantity in ( [ eq : freeenergy ] )",
    "is evaluated as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the middle point of the finite grid with represents the coordinate @xmath102 .",
    "loop @xmath10function is well known @xcite : @xmath103 .",
    "lacking an exact , @xmath35symmetric two  loop solution of the rg equation , the first thing one could try is a linerization around the one  loop sausage solution , regarding @xmath15 as perturbative parameter .",
    "notice in fact that @xmath15 may be scaled out from the sausage solution , through the substitutions @xmath104 which leave the one  loop equation invariant ( actually , with our choice , the scalar curvature @xmath105 is conveniently scaled by a factor of @xmath106 ) . on the other hand",
    "the two  loop equation is transformed by ( [ scalnu ] ) to @xmath107 where the last term could now be treated perturbatively for small sausage deformations .",
    "however , even the linearized equation proves to be too difficult to solve exactly , when the correct boundary conditions for @xmath54 are taken into account , and we resort to a numerical approach .",
    "our idea is the following : in the scaling limit ( far uv and small deformations ) , the exact solution must have the same features of its various loop  wise approximations .",
    "we can now study with our algorithm the two  loop evolution , using as initial data in the far uv ( say at @xmath108 ) a metric with the `` sausage features '' ( e.g. a sausage itself , one  loop solution ) .",
    "we then evaluate our physical quantity in a fixed scale interval @xmath109 and we compare it with the same quantity evaluated starting from the fst by means of bethe ansatz techniques @xcite@xcite .",
    "_ we expect that the difference between the two quantities tends to zero when the starting scale of the evolution is pushed farther and farther in the uv_. at one  loop level this is easily verified , using as starting data , e.g. , the function @xmath110 the above mentioned difference vanish exponentially when the initial scale @xmath111 is sent to @xmath112 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the bethe ansatz techniques are used to compute the free energy as a function of the chemical potential @xmath113 coupled to the physical particles .",
    "the input is the factorized , @xmath35symmetric @xmath93-matrix with deformation parameter @xmath114 relative to the @xmath93-matrix of the @xmath0 sigma model .",
    "the output reads , in the scaling limit @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 fixed , @xmath118\\ ] ] where @xmath119 , and @xmath120 is the mass of the physical particles .",
    "the connection among the various quantities in  ( [ eq : nonp2loopfren ] ) and those contained in the perturbative expressions is established as follows : @xmath121 \\label{link3 }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the relation between the `` scale variables '' @xmath122 and @xmath123 follows by noticing that in the perturbative calculations we put @xmath124 . substituting ( [ link1])-([link3 ] ) in ( [ eq : nonp2loopfren ] ) we obtain @xmath125\\ ] ] where the subscript `` an '' stands for `` analytical '' ( compare ( [ freenum ] ) ) .",
    "the first term comes from the one  loop action ( [ eq : sausaction ] ) , while the second and the third represent the two  loop contributions .",
    "the presence of the non  analytic behaviour @xmath126 ensures the correct @xmath33symmetric limit ( @xmath127 at fixed @xmath128 ) .",
    "corrections of order @xmath15 are not known ; to establish them we should know the corrections of the same order to eqs .",
    "( [ link1])-([link3 ] ) .",
    "our aim is now to compare expressions @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "we have collected numerical data relative to the two  loop evolution of sausages with @xmath15 fixed , starting at different initial scales @xmath78 ( recall that @xmath27 is related to @xmath128 by ( [ quadr ] ) ) .",
    "5 reports the results ; here @xmath131 and the @xmath27 interval is chosen as @xmath132 .",
    "the quantity @xmath133 is defined as @xmath134 and it is plotted for different values of the initial scale @xmath78 .",
    "+ @xmath133 _ does not _ decrease when the scale is pushed towards far uv ; instead , initially increase and then reach an asymptotical value .",
    "the value to which @xmath133 tends is of order @xmath135 ; that means a discrepancy of about 5 parts in 10000 relative to the value of the free energy .",
    "this is well above the numerical errors of our algorithm .",
    "+ we controlled if this discrepancy can be reabsorbed in a `` renormalization '' of @xmath15 ; leaving it as a free parameter in ( [ eq : frentwolooppert ] ) , we seeked for a minimum of @xmath133 in a neighborhood of @xmath136 .",
    "the result was negative .",
    "+ in principle , the non  zero asymptotic value of @xmath133 may be eliminated by the @xmath137 correction ; to test this hypotesis we repeated the evaluation of @xmath133 for different @xmath15 values , and correspondingly redefined the @xmath138interval so to leave the interval @xmath139 fixed , according to the scaling limit .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "6 : the asymptotic value of @xmath133 seems not to depend appreciably upon @xmath15 .",
    "it remains always of the same order of magnitude , and _ does not grow with _ @xmath15 .",
    "the rg equation for the non linear sigma model with fields taking values on a target space with the topology of the 2-sphere is a nonlinear partial  differential equation , possibly nonlocal ( if the @xmath140 function were known to all loop ) .",
    "these features makes it hard to caracterize the general solution in an analytical way .",
    "the numerical approach appears at the moment to be the only way to obtain quantitative informations about the higher  loop solutions .",
    "+ the spectral method presented in this letter proved to be a useful tool for the construction of an efficent algorithm ; this remains true even if the exact rg equation should turn out to be nonlocal .",
    "another future developement concerns the study of solutions without any residual symmetry , hopefully with the help of some `` fast '' algorithm analogous to the well known fft for the fourier case .",
    "+ in the one  loop approximation we have shown the attractive nature of the @xmath35symmetric family of solutions , the so  called sausages .",
    "as far as the two  loop evolution is concerned , however , our data show a discrepancy between calculations based on the rg equation and analogous calculations based on the @xmath35symmetric fst proposed in @xcite .",
    "+ this probably means that the identification put forward in @xcite is not correct , in the sense that the @xmath35symmetric fst after all does not correspond to a @xmath35symmetric nonlinear sigma model reducing to the sausage at one  loop . on this point",
    ", the following alternative conjecture seems natural .",
    "the factorized @xmath141matrix put forward in @xcite is a quantum  group deformation of the @xmath0 @xmath141matrix , in the sense of , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite . in practice ,",
    "the triplet of massive particles of the model forms a spin - one irreducible representation of @xmath142 and scatter through a @xmath143invariant @xmath141matrix with @xmath144 .",
    "hence , the qft corresponding to such fst should enjoy a nonlocal hidden @xmath142 invariance , whose @xmath2 subgroup coincides with the manifest @xmath35symmetry locally implemented . in the usual spirit of the sigma models , in which the field ",
    "theoretical symmetries follow from geometrical properties of the target manifold , we expect this quantum  group invariance to follow from the noncommutative geometry of a @xmath145deformed target manifold @xmath146 ( attempts in constructing @xmath145deformed sigma models can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite @xcite ) .",
    "in other words , we suspect that the fst put forward in @xcite does not correspond , beyond the one  loop approximation , to any conventional nonlinear sigma model ( that is to a model in which the fields take values in an ordinary manifold with commuting geometry ) .",
    "it would be interesting to explain why there exist a one  loop conventional sigma model , perhaps through a suitable expansion near @xmath147 .",
