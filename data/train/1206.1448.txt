    "perovskite manganites belong to a class of materials that have become increasingly important in the last few years , particularly because of the large variety of phenomena they exhibit , closely tied to the strongly correlated nature of their electronic structure .",
    "the series of manganites a@xmath0b@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( a@xmath3 being a lanthanide and b@xmath4 an alkaline earth ) is one of the most intensively studied families.@xcite the interest in these materials grew significantly after the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) , a large negative magneto - resistance taking place under an applied magnetic field,@xcite but also considerable research has focused on their unusual properties such as phase separation,@xcite charge and orbital ordering@xcite and also for their potential applications in thin - film devices,@xcite derived of their peculiar electronic structure properties .",

    "has been recently considered,@xcite suggesting a breakdown of the adiabatic approximation for the itinerant electrons .",
    "these results are related with dynamic phase segregation into hole - rich itinerant - electron regions and hole - poor localized - electron regions , leading to suppression of the conventional double - exchange mechanism .",
    "several theoretical studies have been performed in these manganite perovskite systems using different techniques .",
    "the electronic structure of la@xmath0ca@xmath6mno@xmath2 was calculated using the lapw ( linearized augmented planewave ) method.@xcite transport properties were studied using the virtual crystal approximation , neglecting disorder effects in the lattice.@xcite the formation of a pseudogap follows from numerical calculations based on the dynamical mean field theory , indicating the existence of a charge - nonuniform ground state.@xcite an extensive study of the physics of manganites , including the structure we are studying here , was carried out by salomon et al.@xcite unfortunately , an ab initio description of the phase separation in manganites has not been given in the literature .",
    "it is now widely accepted that some sort of electronic phase segregation is at the origin of the cmr effect in manganites .",
    "moreo _ _ et al.__@xcite proposed a scenario where the coexistence of two phases with different charge density is unstable against breakup into nanometer size clusters due to the coulomb force .",
    "two different kinds of electronic phase segregation have been proposed to exist in manganites:@xcite equal density vs. different density electronic phase segregation at the micro- and nano - scale , respectively . experimentally , magnetic phase separation has been observed in the form of nanoscale phases with different magnetic properties,@xcite i.e. regions in the crystal with nanometric size that present a different magnetic ordering .",
    "imaging techniques@xcite have recently shown the close relationship between nanoscale phase separated regions of an electronic / magnetic origin and cmr . according to those studies , these regions , on the several nm range , have not chemical origin .",

    "the fundamental problem is to give a correct description of how the holes are distributed in the system .",
    "it has been known for long that even the simplest models@xcite predict a non - uniform density distribution of dopants , which are unstable against segregation into hole - rich and hole - poor regions . to gain insight into this problem , in this paper",
    ", we have taken into account a structure with ca@xmath4 doping levels close to @xmath8 ( exactly @xmath9 ) of la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 from a computational point of view via  ab initio \" calculations .",
    "typically , this is not done , and models are utilized instead , due to the large supercells that are required , but even the crudest supercells can help us , as we will see , to understand the electronic and chemical origins of phase separation .",
    "it is worth recalling that the above mentioned doping level is experimentally placed around the critical boundary in which the fm insulating to fm metallic transition occurs at low temperatures with respect to doping.@xcite we have constructed several superstructures in different magnetic configurations to explore the magnetic origin of phase separation . since our calculations yield a homogeneous fm ground state , we will analyze the influence of the ca@xmath4 dopant distribution in the lattice in this magnetic ground state . varying the ca@xmath4 positions from a random distribution to a slightly correlated one , we can analyze the influence of dopant distribution in the electronic structure and the physical properties of the compound by means of  ab initio \" calculations .    for the sake of completeness",
    ", we will make a similar analysis in a very different ca@xmath4 concentration ( @xmath10 ) , in which the ground state is fm metallic becoming paramagnetic insulating at high temperatures .",
    "the idea of that calculation is to study a concentration away from the phase boundaries at @xmath9 and also from @xmath11 , where the ground state becomes an insulating antiferromagnetic ( af ) and charge ordered ( co ) state . at those two hole densities",
    "there is a strong tendency towards phase separation caused by intrinsic inhomogeneities@xcite but @xmath12 ( unlike @xmath9 and @xmath13 ) is not close to the boundary between different ground states in the la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 solid solution.@xcite these analyses will help us discuss the consequences of having chemical inhomogeneities on the nanoscale in these phase separated compounds .",
    "electronic structure calculations were performed within the density functional theory framework @xcite using wien2k software,@xcite which utilizes an augmented plane wave plus local orbitals ( apw+lo ) @xcite method to solve the kohn - sham equations .",
    "this method uses an all - electron , full - potential scheme that makes no shape approximation to the potential or the electron density .    for modeling the correlated behavior of the d electrons of the system ,",
    "we have included strong correlation effects by means of the lda+u scheme,@xcite controlled by an effective u ( u@xmath14=u - j ) , being u the on - site coulomb repulsion and j the on - site exchange constant ( taken as j=0 , as is common practice in literature).@xcite values of u@xmath14 : 2.7 , 4.0 and 5.5 ev were used in the calculations .",

    "calculations predict that these magnetically phase separated states are not stable .",
    "the picture is the same for all values of u we have calculated . from these calculations , we can conclude that the fm configuration at the concentration @xmath23 is the most stable , in agreement with experimental observations at that concentration.@xcite these results suggest that the coexistence of two magnetic phases in the compound require some other changes in the crystallographic and electronic structure for it to be stable .",

    ", we found this one is more stable by about 19 mev / mn with respect to the second most stable configuration , and by 219 mev / mn to the most unstable configuration ( largest chemical homogeneity attainable at this concentration ) .",
    "this means that a non - homogeneous dopant distribution occurs in the material that would lead to a nanoscale distribution of effective concentrations .",
    "analogous results in terms of dopant distribution energetics can be found in other magnetic configurations ( hence , it is not an issue of the fm solution ) .        the most stable @xmath35 value is larger than one cubic perovskite lattice parameter .",
    "several perovskite subcells will be involved in forming this ground state ca@xmath4 distribution .",
    "moreover , variations of the atomic position of the various ca@xmath4 cations will imply different environments for each of the mn atoms in the unit cell .",
    "thus , the existence of areas with such a typical size suggests the magnetic and electronic characteristics differ inside and outside the clusters leading to an electronically inhomogeneous state on a nanometric scale in la@xmath20ca@xmath21mno@xmath22 .",

    "this corresponds to an average mn valence of + 3.1875 .",
    "we can also analyze the magnetic moments inside the muffin - tin spheres for each of the mn atoms .",
    "these are summarized in table [ mn_mmi ] .",

    "they show the importance of chemical ordering at the nanoscale when the system is close to a metal - insulator transition . the presence of chemical inhomogeneities on a similar nanometric scale than the experimentally observed electronic / magnetic phase separation could act as a precursor for the phase separated scenario to develop in the system .",
    "the largest deviation around the @xmath470.1875 in terms of ca concentration ( @xmath39 ) is about 0.04 ( slightly larger than the equivalent deviation in the magnetic moments of mn atoms , which was calculated to be about 0.01 ) .",
    "chemical variations are stronger than the electronic variations .",
    "changes in the local doping of each mn will vary the effective ca concentration from @xmath48 , which are enough to move the system to the other side of the magnetic / electronic phase transition , that occurs at about @xmath49 .",
    "in fact , different nanosize domains have been experimentally detected around this compositional range : fm clusters of 16   for @xmath50 whereas an approximate size of 8   has been observed for @xmath51.@xcite this last result confirms the existence of fm clusters confined in about two perovskite subcells , in a similar scale than the chemical inhomogeneities we find in our calculations for @xmath9 .",

    "the above range of ca@xmath4 concentrations is always far enough from the fm insulator ground state at @xmath49 as well as the afm with co ground state observed at @xmath11 . in spite of this",
