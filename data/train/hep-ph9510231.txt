    "the general theoretical framework for the description of high energy exclusive processes within perturbative qcd has been widely discussed in the literature @xcite and , although it has not yet reached the same level of reliability and variety of applications as the factorization theorem for the inclusive interactions , is expected to work at large momentum transfers and indeed several successful calculations have been performed so far in some simple cases @xcite .",
    "the numerical results depend strongly on the internal structure of the hadrons involved which , in the exclusive cases , are described by the hadron wave functions or distribution amplitudes , analogous to the distribution functions of the inclusive case .",
    "perturbative qcd fixes the asymptotic form of these amplitudes at @xmath4 and their general evolution , but in any realistic calculation they have to be taken as phenomenological quantities , to be experimentally determined via a set of physical information and then used in other processes .",
    "this procedure has led to the success of some distribution amplitudes motivated by qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "some criticism has been advanced to the validity of the whole scheme , on the ground that it necessarily involves a contribution from soft non perturbative regions @xcite ; such criticism has been answered by noticing that these soft contributions are suppressed by sudakov form factors @xcite . while this gives a better understanding and credibility to the theoretical model it weakens the agreement between theoretical computations , based on the qcd sum rule distribution amplitudes @xcite , and experiment ; in fact these distribution amplitudes enhance the contribution of the soft end point regions , which are now known to be depressed by the sudakov form factors .",
    "moreover , some lattice estimates @xcite and further theoretical considerations @xcite have suggested different shapes for the distribution amplitudes , closer to the asymptotic ones ; the situation is then less clear and better phenomenological studies have to be performed in order to improve our knowledge of the properties of the hadrons and to reach the possibility of making genuine predictions .",
    "we consider here the @xmath5 decay process of polarized charmonium states created in @xmath6 or @xmath7 interactions and show how the observation of the polarization of the vector meson , via a measurement of its diagonal helicity density matrix elements , neatly depends on the @xmath0 distribution amplitudes and helps in discriminating between different kinds of these quantities .",
    "the same process has already been studied , with different purposes , in two previous papers @xcite , first in the exclusive channel @xmath8 @xcite and then in the inclusive one @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the goal there was that of assessing the significance of higher twist mass effects , rather than that of discussing the role of different distribution amplitudes : actually , it turned out that , independently of the chosen meson wave functions , only mass effects could give origin to non zero off - diagonal helicity density matrix elements , @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "any non zero measurement of even a single one of these non diagonal elements , signaling the violation of the helicity conservation rule , would be a clear signature of mass corrections .",
    "here we compute , within massless perturbative qcd , the diagonal element @xmath12 and study its dependence on the distribution amplitudes , @xmath13 ; to be safe from mass corrections we exploit the results of refs . @xcite and @xcite and only consider kinematical regions in which such corrections are known to be small .",
    "the variations resulting from the choice of different distribution amplitudes can not then be ascribed to other reasons . in the next section",
    "we briefly recall the computations of refs . @xcite and @xcite and",
    "show analytical expressions which are numerically evaluated in section 3 , which contains our results and where we also give some conclusive comments .",
    "we improve on the computations of refs . @xcite and @xcite by explicitly introducing the @xmath14 evolution of the distribution amplitudes and the strong coupling constant @xmath15 .",
    "the full processes we are considering are either the exclusive , @xmath17 or the inclusive , @xmath18 production of a pair of @xmath0 vector mesons with the subsequent decay @xmath19 and the quantity experimentally observed is the angular distribution of either one of the pions in the helicity rest frame of the decaying @xmath0 @xcite . in the inclusive case ( [ inc ] )",
