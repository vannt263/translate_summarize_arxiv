    "sgr a * in our galactic centre has been extensively studied in the category of accretion processes because it is a supermassive black hole candidate in our galaxy and has unique observational features incompatible with the standard thin disc model ( shakura - sunyaev , hereafter s - s , model ; shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "one of the remarkable features of sgr a * is that the observed luminosity is five orders of magnitude lower than that predicted by the s - s model .",
    "moreover , the spectrum of sgr a * differs from the multi - temperature blackbody spectrum obtained from the s ",
    "s model . since the observational features of sgr a * can not be explained by the s  s model , two types of theoretical models , namely the spherical bondi accretion model without any net angular momentum @xcite and the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model with high angular momentum @xcite , have been proposed ( see narayan & mcclintock 2008 , yuan 2011 and yuan & narayan 2014 for review ) . both the bondi model and the adaf model result in highly advected flows and the radiative efficiency is so low as to be compatible with the observations .",
    "however , in contrast with the simple bondi model , the adaf models were shown to be generally successful and more advanced models @xcite , taking into account the parametric description of the outflow and jet , explain well the observations .",
    "the important key to these models for sgr a * is the amount of angular momentum in the accretion flow .",
    "however , at present , we have no clear evidence for the angular momentum from observations .",
    "the low angular momentum flow model belongs to an intermediate case between the bondi model and the adaf model and was applied to sgr a * @xcite . assuming that the wolf - rayet star @xmath9 13 @xmath10 is the dominant source of the matter accreting on to sgr a * and assuming the wind temperature @xmath11 = 1.0 or 0.5 kev , they estimated the net angular momentum @xmath0 of 1.682.16 and the bernoulli constant @xmath1 of @xmath12@xmath13 , where the mass @xmath14 of sgr a * , the speed of light @xmath15 and the schwarzschild radius @xmath16 are used as the units of mass , velocity and distance and @xmath17 is the gravitational constant .",
    "with these flow parameters for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , they showed analytically that there is no continuous flow solution which attains to the event horizon , and the resulting flow would be non - stationary , but that , for the case of the angular momentum @xmath0= 1.55 lower than the best estimates for sgr a * , there exists a standard stationary shock solution . motivated by their suggestion and results , we examined the low angular momentum flow model for sgr a * using 2d time - dependent hydrodynamical calculations and discussed the results on the activity of sgr a * @xcite .",
    "however , in the initial model used , we assumed a constant ratio of the ion temperature @xmath18 to the electron temperature @xmath19 throughout the region . in this paper , without using such assumption , we solve coherently relevant differential equations of the accretion flow which include the radiative processes of heating and cooling , and examine time - dependent behaviours of the 2d accretion flow in the relevance to the activity of sgr a*.",
    "we consider a supermassive black hole with mass @xmath20 and examine a 1d low angular momentum flow around sgr a*. we use here typical flow parameters of the specific angular momentum @xmath0 , the specific total energy @xmath1 and the mass accretion rate @xmath21 yr@xmath22which were estimated for the accretion flow around sgr a * @xcite .",
    "first , we solve the bernoulli equation of a thin , rotating , inviscid and adiabatic accretion flow with a single temperature @xmath23 and a constant angular momentum @xmath0 , find the outer and inner sonic points , and get the mach number versus radius relation , the sound speed @xmath24 , the thickness @xmath25 of the accretion flow , the radial velocity @xmath26 and the temperature @xmath23 at a given radius @xmath27 as is done in @xcite .",
    "we assume here that the accretion flow is in hydrostatic equilibrium in vertical direction @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the total gas pressure and the density . the bernoulli constant @xmath1 is given by    @xmath31    where @xmath24 and @xmath32 are the sound velocity and the specific heat ratio . in this paper , we consider two models of @xmath0 = 1.68 and @xmath1 = @xmath33 ( model a ) and @xmath0 = 1.35 and @xmath1 = @xmath34 ( model b ) in the usual nondimensional units . the mach number versus radius relation in the models is given in figs  1 and  2 in the previous paper @xcite . in model",
    "a , the particle which passes through the outer sonic point falls down supersonically inwards but never attains the event horizon since it makes a closed loop of the mach number curve . on the other hand , in model b ,",
    "the particle falls supersonically , jumps to a subsonic state at the shock position of @xmath35 and tends supersonically towards the event horizon .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it should be noticed that the different temperatures of ions and electrons are caused only by the different adiabatic indices of ions and electrons and not by the effects of the radiative energy loss and gain .",
    "the transfer rate of the advected thermal energy fallen into the event horizon is much larger than the total amounts of the radiative heating and cooling .",
    "2 shows the energy transfer rate @xmath36 ( dash  dotted line ) from ions to electrons , the bremsstrahlung cooling rate @xmath37 ( dashed line ) , the synchrotron cooling rate @xmath38 ( longdashed line ) and the transfer rate @xmath39 of the advected thermal energy versus radius in model b. the advected thermal energy term @xmath39 is by more than three orders of magnitude larger in the inner region compared with the cooling terms and balances exactly the rate @xmath40 of the internal energy increment by compression .",
    "only the synchrotron cooling rate increases with increasing @xmath4 and becomes comparable to the advected thermal energy term for the case of large @xmath41 .",
    "the adiabatic flow is due to the large radial velocity comparable to the free - fall velocity , the too low density of the gas and the large accretion flow thickness with @xmath42 .",
    "accordingly , as long as the magnetic field is taken to be as @xmath5 , the effects of the radiative heating and cooling are negligible and the two - temperature model is ascribed to the adiabatic two - temperature model .",
    "thus , solving the 1d stationary differential equations , we get the accretion flow of model b but not of model a. however , we do not know yet whether the shock phenomena found in the previous paper occur or not and what accretion flow occurs actually in model a. the 1d flow equations also do not take account of the outflow which plays an important role in the actual accretion flow . then",
    ", we examine the time - dependent 2d accretion flow .",
    "the set of relevant time - dependent equations are given in the spherical polar coordinates ( @xmath27,@xmath43,@xmath44 ) :    @xmath45    @xmath46 -{\\partial p\\over \\partial r},\\ ] ]    @xmath47    @xmath48    @xmath49    and @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the three velocity components , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the specific internal energy of the ion and electron . here",
    "we neglect the radiation transport assuming that the flow is optically thin .",
    "the set of partial differential equations ( 18)(23 ) is numerically solved by a finite - difference method under adequate initial and boundary conditions .",
    "the initial flow variables are given from the 1d solutions in section 2 but , at @xmath54 in model a , are given by extrapolation of nearby variables because the 1d solution of model a was obtained only at @xmath55 .",
    "this approximation of the variables never influence the final result as long as the flow variables at the outer boundary are fixed constantly and a sufficiently large integration time is taken . the initial atmosphere above the accreting matter in the computational region is given as a radially hydrostatic equilibrium state with zero azimuthal velocities everywhere .",
    "physical variables at the inner boundary , except for the velocities , are given by extrapolation of the variables near the boundary .",
    "however , we impose limit conditions that the radial velocities at the boundary are given by a free - fall velocity and the angular velocities are zero . as for the outer boundary region above the outer accreting matter , we use free - floating conditions and allow for the outflow of matter , whereas here any inflow is prohibited . with these initial and boundary conditions , we perform time integration of equations ( 18)(23 ) until a quasi - steady solution is obtained .",
    "we show here the results of model a and b with @xmath8 .",
    "the total luminosity @xmath56 is a good measure to check whether a steady state of the accretion flow is attained and is given by @xmath57 . the mass - outflow rate @xmath58 is here given as the total flow rate of the outflow at the outer boundary . in model a , a shock is at first formed at @xmath59 on the equatorial plane , expands outwards gradually and finally moves up and down irregularly around @xmath60 . due to the modulation of the shock position , the total luminosity varies by a factor of 2 and",
    "the averaged one is @xmath61 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "the mass - outflow rate also varies by a factor of @xmath62 4 and its averaged mass - ouflow rate is as high as @xmath63 g s@xmath3 . about half of the input accreting matter is ejected as the wind . in model b , the shock wave appears in the inner region of @xmath64 which is a predicted value from the analysis in the 1d adiabatic case .",
    "then , the shock moves outwards gradually , recedes inwards after attaining to a position of @xmath65 and finally continues to oscillate irregularly between the radii of 45 and 65 @xmath66 . during the shock evolution",
    ", another weak shock appears inside the outer shock , disappears interacting with the outer shock and the inner edge and the processes are repeated irregularly .",
    "the shock phenomena cause the complicated modulations of the luminosity and the mass - outflow rate .",
    "3 shows the time variations of the total luminosity @xmath56 , the luminosity of the synchrotron radiation @xmath67 , the mass - outflow rate @xmath58 , the mass - inflow rate @xmath68 at the inner edge and the shock position @xmath69 on the equatorial plane in model b. the total luminosity varies by a factor of 2 with time - scales of hours to days and the averaged luminosity is @xmath70 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "the luminosity of the synchrotron radiation is @xmath71 erg s@xmath3 and varies largely by a factor of @xmath72 .",
    "the mass - outflow rate varies intermittently by a factor of 1.5 .",
    "and the averaged value at later phases is @xmath73 g s@xmath3 which is several percent of the input matter .",
    "accordingly , in this model , most of the input accreting matter falls into the event horizon through the inner edge .",
    "the origin of the oscillating shock appearing in the present models is entirely attributed to the range of parameters of the specific energy and the specific angular momentum used here .",
    "the oscillatory shock is necessarily triggered if the specific angular momentum @xmath0 and the specific energy @xmath1 belong to or are located just nearby in the range of parameters responsible for a stationary shock in the rotating inviscid and adiabatic accretion flow , as is found in the previous paper .",
    "sgr a * possesses a quiescent state and a flare state .",
    "the flares and their quasi - periodicity of sgr a * have been detected in multiple wavebands from radio , sub - millimetre , ir to x - ray @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes of the flare at radio , ir and x - ray are by factors of below 1/2 , 15 and 45 or even higher , respectively , a few times per day .",
    "the rapid variability in the radio band on time - scales of a few seconds to hours has been observed @xcite .",
    "these flare phenomena are interesting in relation to the time variations of the luminosity .",

    "for the comparison with the above spectra , we show the energy spectra of model b with @xmath97 ( dash - dotted line ) in fig .",

    "the present simple model can not reproduce the detailed spectra of sgr a * as are successfully found in the adaf models @xcite but it is useful to examine the basic scenario of the low angular momentum flow model .",
    "following the previous paper based on the analysis of the angular momentum of the accretion flow around sgr a * by @xcite , we examined a low angular momentum flow model for sgr a * using 1d stationary and 2d time - dependent hydrodynamical calculations under the two - temperature model . adopting the model parameters of the specific angular momenta @xmath0 of 1.35 and 1.68 and the input accretion rates of @xmath102 yr@xmath3 , we summarize the results as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) as long as the ratio @xmath4 of the magnetic energy density to the thermal energy density is taken to be as @xmath5 , the radiative energy loss and gain due to the coulomb collisions , the bremsstrahlung and the synchrotron emissions are negligible on the dynamics of the flow and the two - temperature model is ascribed to the adiabatic two - temperature model .",
    "\\(2 ) the different temperatures of ions and electrons are caused by the different adiabatic indices of ions and electrons which depend on their temperature states under the relativistic regime .",
    "the total luminosity increases with increasing @xmath4 and results in @xmath6  @xmath7 erg s@xmath3 for @xmath8  1.0 which is comparable to the observed luminosity of sgr a*.    \\(3 ) due to the constant low angular momentum flow , the irregularly oscillating shocks are formed in the inner region , as is found in the previous paper , and the luminosity and the mass - outflow rate are modulated by a factor of 2  3 and 1.5  4 , respectively , on time - scales of hours to days .",
    "\\(4 ) the time variability may be related to the flare phenomena of sgr a*.    further evidence of the low angular momentum of the accretion flow around sgr a * would confirm the validity of the model . if the specific angular momentum of the accretion flow around sgr a * is actually as small as @xmath0=1.35 1.68 , the time variabilities of the total luminosity found in models a and b may explain the quiescent and flare states of sgr a * at the radio to ir bands except for x - rays .",
    "however , there remain important problems of the too high x - ray variability and the time lag between the radio and x - ray flares in sgr a*. in stead of this scenario for the flare activity of sgr a * , we may interpret alternative one for the quiescent and flare states of sgr a * , somewhat on the analogy of the temporal sequence of accretion disc  jet coupling observed in the x - rays , ir and radio wavelengths of the microquasar grs 1915 + 105 @xcite .",
    "then we regard the total emission obtained in the models as the permanent emission of the quiescent state but consider that the emission variabilities in sgr a * are caused by the intermittent outflow found in the present models , where the mass - outflow rates are as high as @xmath103  @xmath104yr@xmath3 and vary by a factor of 1.5  4 and the outflow escapes as the high - velocity jets with 0.01  0.2@xmath15 along the rotational axis .",
    "we speculate here that the intermittent high - velocity jets propagate outwards , interact with the surrounding matter and excite the matter as a hot emitter .",
    "the emission from the hot matter may be observed as an amplified flare in x - rays .",
    "after that , the high - velocity jets expand furthermore , cool down adiabatically , interact again with the distant interstellar cloud and emit radio emission which is observed as a radio flare with a time lag . in the present models ,",
    "we have treated only the inviscid accretion flow .",
    "if the accretion flow is actually viscous flow in sgr a * system , the present result of the low angular momentum flow model will be changed largely and the application of the shock phenomena to the time variability of sgr a * will be invalid because of no shock formation .",
    "the present low angular momentum flow model is also simple and can not reproduce the detailed observed spectra of sgr a*. for the spectral fitting with the observations , we need to treat the physics of the synchrotron and inverse compton emission by the thermal and non - thermal electrons .",
    "a further magneto - hydrodynamical examination of the flow with the low angular momentum including the above physics should be pursued in the future .",
    "i thank an anonymous referee for useful suggestion of the adiabatic index effects of ions and electrons on the two  temperature model ."
