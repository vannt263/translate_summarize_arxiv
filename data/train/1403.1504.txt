    "relativistic heavy - ion collisions at bombarding energies of 1 - 2a gev provide the unique possibility to study nuclear matter at high temperatures , around 100  mev , and baryon densities about 2 - 3 times the normal nuclear matter density(@xmath4 ) @xcite . under these conditions ,",
    "the properties of hadrons may be altered as a result of various non - trivial in - medium effects like the partial restoration of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry , the modified baryon - meson couplings , and the nuclear potential . whether and how hadronic properties , such as masses , widths and dispersion relations are modified in the hot and dense nuclear medium",
    "is a topic of great current interest . in particular ,",
    "strange mesons produced around the production threshold energies in nucleon - nucleon collisions are considered to be sensitive to in - medium modifications .",
    "various theoretical approaches agree qualitatively predicting slightly repulsive @xmath5- and strongly attractive @xmath6 potentials @xcite .",
    "the depth of the @xmath6 potential at finite densities is , however , not well constrained by currently available data and is a matter of an active theoretical dispute @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath7 potential is sufficiently deep , this might have exciting consequences for the stability of neutron stars @xcite or for the existence of deeply bound @xmath3 states @xcite .",
    "heavy - ion experiments , with the capability to identify kaons and antikaons , have been performed with the kaos , fopi and hades detector systems at the heavy - ion synchrotron ( sis ) of gsi , aiming at measuring the in - medium properties . a significantly enhanced yield of @xmath3 mesons relative to that of @xmath2 @xcite , an increase of the @xmath8 ratio at low kinetic energy of kaons @xcite , and different freeze - out conditions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons",
    "were observed @xcite , the latter at least partially explained by the production of @xmath9 mesons @xcite . after the suggestion that the @xmath5 potential should manifest itself in the collective motion of kaons , referred to as ` flow ' @xcite , a lot of effort was invested to deduce the strength of the kaon potential by measuring the kaon flow in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "experimental difficulties due to the small production rate of @xmath10 mesons in comparison to @xmath11 in the sis energy regime restrict the measurements .",
    "currently available flow results for @xmath3 mesons are not sufficient to draw conclusions on the existence and strength of the @xmath6 in - medium potential .    in this article",
    ", we report for the first time on the simultaneous measurements of @xmath12 and @xmath13 mesons with a large acceptance spectrometer at an incident beam energy of 1.91agev that is close to the various strangeness production threshold energies .",
    "the data are compared to state - of - the - art transport calculations with and without the assumption of an in - medium potential . in particular , we show the azimuthal anisotropy of @xmath3 mesons in a wide range of rapidity and the centrality dependence of @xmath14 differential flow of @xmath11 mesons .",
    "the experiment was performed with the fopi spectrometer , an azimuthally symmetric apparatus comprising several sub detectors @xcite .",
    "recently a high resolution highly granular time - of - flight ( tof ) barrel based on multi - strip multi - gap resistive plate counters ( mmrpc ) @xcite was added to the fopi apparatus improving significantly the kaon identification capability .",
    "charged kaons are identified based on the tof - information from mmrpc and plastic scintillator barrel ( psb ) , combined with the momentum information from the central drift chamber ( cdc , @xmath15 ) , see table  [ table : accep ] .",

    "the experimental data on @xmath16 and @xmath17 of @xmath18 for the total event sample ( a ) ( see table  [ table : rpcor ] ) are presented as function of @xmath19 in fig .",
    "[ fig : v1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : v2 ] .",
    "@xmath20 is by definition antisymmetric with respect to mid - rapidity , therefore it should vanish at mid - rapidity for a symmetric collision system . however , we observe , like in other fopi data @xcite@xcite , a deviation from zero .",
    "systematic investigation of @xmath21 at mid - rapidity @xmath22 showed a dependence on centrality , particle type and system size suggesting a correlation with track density . when reconstructing the reaction plane with the best possible accuracy ( i.e. largest polar angle range @xmath23 ) the @xmath21 at mid - rapidity was found to be independent of transverse momentum in the system ni+ni at 2agev .",
    "the origin of the @xmath21-`shift ' was investigated by means of monte carlo study using the geant3 package @xcite . within the monte carlo framework",
    "the fopi apparatus is described including the resolution in energy deposition and spatial position , front - end electronic processing , hit reconstruction , hit tracking and track matching between the sub - detectors .",
    "the output of geant was analyzed in the same way as the experimental data . as observed in the data , the @xmath21-`shift ' at mid - rapidity",
    "was found to depend on centrality and particle type , and to be independent of transverse momentum .",
    "however , the magnitude of the shift is underestimated by the simulation , and hence the monte carlo data can not be used to correct the experimental values quantitatively .",
    "we adopt a conservative approach and attribute the full shift at mid - rapidity as systematic uncertainty ( boxes in fig .",
    "[ fig : v1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : v1pt.cent ] ) .",
    "since the local track density seen by the cdc only depends on the azimuthal angle and not on the polar angle we assume the systematic uncertainty to be rapidity independent .",

    "[ fig : v1 ] ) .",
    "this pattern is called ` anti - flow ' and is in agreement with previous fopi measurement @xcite .",
    "additionally the @xmath2 mesons are observed to collectively move out - of - plane ( fig .",

    "[ fig : v1 ] ( c ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : v2 ] ( c ) ) , both @xmath26 and @xmath17 are compatible with zero within the statistical sensitivity of the data , i.e. an isotropic emission pattern is observed .",
    "the kaos collaboration has measured @xmath27 coefficients of @xmath18 to be @xmath28 and @xmath29 at mid - rapidity for the same collision system at the same beam energy , however , with a different detector acceptance and collision centrality ( @xmath30 fm ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath27 values from our data , reduced to the same centrality range and acceptance , are compatible with the kaos results , but do not show any indication for in - plane emission of @xmath3 mesons .    in order to link the flow measurements to the @xmath18 properties in the nuclear medium ,",
    "a comparison to the predictions of transport model calculations is necessary . for this analysis",
    "we utilize the hadron string dynamics ( hsd ) model @xcite and isospin quantum molecular dynamics ( iqmd ) @xcite offering a state - of - the - art description of kaon dynamics @xcite .",
    "the models employ different in - medium scenarios for the modification of strange particle properties in the dense and hot medium : in hsd the chiral perturbation theory @xcite for kaons and a coupled channel g - matrix approach @xcite for antikaons are implemented . in iqmd transport approach the relativistic mean - field model for kaons and antikaons based on a chiral su(3 ) model is used @xcite .",
    "the centrality selection imposed on the data is realized by weighting the events with an impact parameter dependent function .",
    "this function is obtained by evaluating the influence of a multiplicity selection on the impact parameter distribution within the iqmd model which describes the multiplicity distribution  after cluster formation  reasonably well .",
    "earlier data on flow of @xmath2 mesons @xcite and the @xmath31 spectra in pion induced reactions @xcite were successfully described by hsd with a repulsive @xmath5 potential of @xmath32  mev for particles at rest ( @xmath33 ) , at normal nuclear matter density and a linear dependence on baryon density .",
    "employing this parametrization for the @xmath34 potential in both hsd and iqmd , and a similar , but attractive one with @xmath35mev in iqmd and a g - matrix formalism corresponding to @xmath36mev in hsd for the @xmath7 potential the model predictions depicted by the full lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : v1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : v2 ] are obtained .",
    "the phase space distributions obtained from the transport calculations are filtered for the detector acceptance .",
    "the flow observables are calculated using the true reaction plane .",
    "typical statistical uncertainties in the calculations are of the order @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the effect of the in - medium potentials is visible in the difference to the model calculations without in - medium potential ( dashed lines ) that still include @xmath39 rescattering and absorption processes for @xmath40 mesons .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : v1 ] reveals that according to the transport models the largest sensitivity to the presence of in - medium potentials is achieved with the sideflow observable , @xmath21 , near target rapidity . without any in - medium modifications",
    "the @xmath2 mesons should be emitted nearly isotropic , i.e. @xmath21 and @xmath17 values are close to zero .",
    "the presence of a repulsive @xmath34 potential manifests itself by pushing the @xmath2 mesons away from the protons , thus generating the ` anti - flow ' signature of @xmath2 mesons .",
    "the magnitude of the ` anti - flow ' is correctly described by iqmd transport approach with the assumption of a @xmath34 potential of @xmath32  mev , while hsd predicts the ` anti - flow ' effect but quantitatively overestimates the magnitude of the experimentally observed ` anti - flow ' . for @xmath3 mesons",
    "the interpretation is different : because of the strong absorption due to strangeness exchange reactions with baryons , an ` anti - flow ' signature is expected without the presence of a potential ( fig .",
    "[ fig : v1 ] ) .",
    "this is clearly disfavored by the data .",
    "assuming an additional attraction of @xmath3 toward protons , due to strong interaction , the iqmd transport model predicts an almost isotropic emission pattern , as it is observed in the data .",
    "hsd predicts a strong ` flow ' signature in the near target region , though .",
    "following both model predictions the data indicate the presence of an attractive @xmath7 potential . following the iqmd approach ,",
    "the depth of the potential can be constrained to @xmath41mev .",
    "the second harmonic @xmath27 of @xmath2 mesons ( fig .",
    "[ fig : v2 ] ) shows a squeeze - out signature at mid - rapidity that is explained within the iqmd model by the presence of an in - medium potential . the hsd model predicts a weak squeeze - out effect , deviating by about 2 @xmath42 from the data . within the statistical sensitivity of the data",
    "this observable does not show any sensitivity to the potential away from mid - rapidity .    in the near target rapidity region",
    "the experimental @xmath27 is underestimated by both model calculations . however , the deviation is at the limit of the statistical significance .",
    "note that also the @xmath27 values of protons ( fig .",
    "[ fig : v2 ] ) are not reproduced by hsd . in the case of @xmath3 elliptic flow ,",
    "experimental uncertainties are too large to draw any conclusion about the @xmath7 potential .    to probe the consistency of the transport model description of the current data , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v1 ] , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : v1pt.cent ] the differential dependence of @xmath21 on the transverse momentum @xmath1 for @xmath2 mesons near target rapidity ( @xmath43 ) for the two centrality classes ( p ) and ( c ) defined in table  [ table : rpcor ] .",
    "( color online ) transverse momentum(@xmath1 ) dependence of @xmath21 distributions for @xmath11 mesons in peripheral ( a ) and central ( b ) collisions in comparison to hsd and iqmd predictions with ( solid lines ) and without ( dashed lines ) in - medium potentials . ]    in the central event sample the data are compatible with both , hsd and iqmd , calculations employing the in - medium potential described above , in agreement to previously published fopi results @xcite .",
    "the iqmd calculations reproduce the transverse momentum dependence and the strength of the @xmath21 coefficient for low transverse momenta ( @xmath44 gev / c ) .",
    "this quality of iqmd is also observed for the peripheral event sample , where the data show a slightly stronger @xmath1 dependence as compared to the central case .",
    "within hsd the transverse momentum dependence is strongly over - predicted leading to very large asymmetries at small @xmath1 that are excluded by the data .",
    "the influence of the coulomb interaction was studied within the hsd transport model by comparing the flow patterns of @xmath45 and @xmath46 mesons .",
    "both members of the isospin doublet show a similar @xmath1 dependence of @xmath21 , but in case of @xmath46 mesons the predicted ` anti - flow ' is up to 12 % higher at low transverse momenta .",
    "this difference is attributed to the additional repulsion due to electromagnetic interaction between @xmath46 mesons and protons in the near target region .",
    "the long range influence of the coulomb attraction / repulsion between kaons and nucleons of the projectile and target remnants was investigated with the saca clusterization algorithm @xcite which simulates the propagation of particles in the coulomb field up to flight times of @xmath47 10,000 fm / c .",
    "statistically significant influence was found only for the very small momenta , beneath the detector acceptance .",
    "we conclude that most of the asymmetry is caused by the strong interaction and that @xmath21 can constrain the depth of the @xmath5 potential .",
    "we have measured the azimuthal emission patterns of @xmath48 mesons in heavy - ion collisions near the strangeness production threshold energies . in case of @xmath2 mesons a weak in - plane `",
    "anti - flow ' with respect to protons and a slight ` squeeze - out ' are observed . for @xmath3 mesons , within large statistic uncertainties , isotropic emission pattern is observed . despite the large uncertainties ,",
    "the comparison to two independent predictions of hsd and iqmd without potential especially of the first fourier coefficient implies the existence of a weakly attractive @xmath7 in - medium potential .",
    "furthermore , the iqmd transport approach , which is able to reproduce the dynamics of nucleons and @xmath2 mesons , suggests a @xmath7 in - medium potential of @xmath49mev .",
    "the theoretical modeling of the in - medium potentials , or more generally of the in - medium interactions , is reasonably well achieved within the iqmd transport approach as is demonstrated by the detailed comparison of the differential flow pattern of the @xmath2 mesons . within hsd",
    ", the general dynamics of nucleons and @xmath2 mesons is reproduced as well , however the quantitative description of the flow pattern in some regions of the phase space is not accurately achieved yet .",
    "the observed dependencies and sensitivities point to the feasibility to extract the strength of the in - medium potentials from a quantitative description of a complete set of flow data .",
    "more systematic data and theoretical efforts are clearly necessary to reach this important goal .",
