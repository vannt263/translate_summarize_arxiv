    "the characteristics of dark matter ( dm ) and the nature of its production mechanism have so far eluded description .",
    "while cosmological observations provide compelling evidence for its existence , its mass and the nature of its interactions with the standard model remain unknown .",
    "one popular hypothesis holds that the dm interacts with standard model particles via the weak interaction and is also self - annihilating . in this weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) scenario  @xcite , the correct relic density of dm is a natural consequence of the thermal history of the early universe .    alternatively , dm may carry a conserved charge , analogous to baryon number . this asymmetric dm ( adm ) scenario",
    "is motivated by the fact that the dm and baryon densities are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the earliest models attempting to relate the dm to the baryon asymmetry made use of electroweak sphalerons @xcite or out - of - equilibrium decay @xcite .",
    "the former often run into tight constraints from lep measurements .",
    "in contrast , the modern incarnation of adm makes use of higher dimension operators to transfer the asymmetry in a robust way that is relatively free of electroweak constraints @xcite .",
    "adm models prefer to have dm mass around a few gev ( see for example  @xcite ) , which is consistent with hints from recent direct detection experiments  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible for adm to have weak scale mass @xcite , or mass well below a gev @xcite .",
    "the dm mass and its scattering cross section with nuclei have been constrained by various underground direct detection experiments  @xcite , as well as by particle colliders  @xcite . in this article , we study the properties of adm through its impacts on stellar systems . it has long been appreciated that a finite dm - nucleon cross section would result in dm capture in stars  @xcite . in the wimp scenario ,",
    "dm annihilation can generate an additional heat source , which may affect stellar formation  @xcite and evolution @xcite , or cause anomalous heating of white dwarfs  @xcite and neutron stars  @xcite . in the adm case , dm particles do not annihilate and hence provide no additional power for stars .",
    "however , since there is no annihilation to deplete adm particles , stars can accumulate far more adm particles than usual wimps , which can lead to different effects .",
    "for example , it could have implications for solar physics  @xcite , or change the mass - radius relation of neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "the most extreme possibility is that captured particles can become self - gravitating , forming a black hole that will eventually destroy the host stars  @xcite .",
    "recently , constraints on fermionic adm through the survival of compact stars have been discussed in  @xcite . in a certain class of adm models ,",
    "the dm candidate is a boson  @xcite . in this paper , we study constraints on this scalar adm from compact stars .",
    "scalar dm particles differ from fermions by spin statistics , which has a significant impact on black hole formation conditions .",
    "black hole formation occurs only when the total number of self - gravitating dm particles is larger than the chandrasekhar limit  @xcite .",
    "fermions obey the pauli exclusion principle , and the chandrasekhar limit is set by the balance between gravity and the fermi pressure , while scalar particles have no fermi pressure to hinder gravity . in this case , the lower limit for gravitational collapse is determined by the balance between gravity and the pressure induced by the zero point energy , which is much smaller than the pauli pressure experienced by fermions .",
    "therefore , we derive much stronger constraints on scalar adm from compact stars .",
    "since neutron stars have much higher matter density and escape velocity than any other stars , we will mainly focus on neutron stars .",
    "note that neutron star constraints on scalar dm has been discussed in  @xcite . in this early work",
    ", the cross section for the dm capture is set by the geometric cross section , and the dm mass range is between @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in this work ,",
    "we treat the dm - neutron cross section as a free parameter and use neutron stars to constrain it .",
    "other important considerations that we treat here are the effect of bose - einstein condensation , which significantly alters the constraint derived on the dm - neutron scattering cross - section , and hawking radiation , which modifies our constraints for high mass dm .",
    "we also explore a wider dm mass range and use the most recent neutron star data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the chandrasekhar limit for fermions and bosons . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss adm capture in neutron stars . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss thermalization , condensation and black hole formation of captured scalar adm in neutron stars . in sec .",
    "v , we discuss hawking radiation and destruction of the host neutron star . in sec .",
    "vi , we discuss observational constraints .",
    "we present our conclusions in sec .",
    "first , we review the derivation of the chandrasekhar limit for a system of fermions .",
    "suppose there are @xmath4 fermions of mass @xmath5 distributed in a sphere with radius @xmath6 , so that the number density of fermions is approximately @xmath7 . because of the pauli exclusion principle , the average distance between two fermions is @xmath8 .",
    "the uncertainty principle requires that each fermion have fermi momentum @xmath9 .",
    "if the total number @xmath4 is small and @xmath10 , the system is in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "the average energy per fermion is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is newton s constant .",
    "once the gravitational and fermi pressures reach equilibrium , the system can have a stable spherical configuration with radius @xmath13 as @xmath4 increases , the radius shrinks and the fermi momentum increases ; eventually fermions become relativistic with total energy @xmath14 if the total number of the fermions increases beyond the limit @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the planck scale , the gravitational energy will dominate the total particle energy and gravitational collapse will occur . this is the famous chandrasekhar limit  @xcite .",
    "now we discuss bosons .",
    "similar to the fermion case , the gravitational collapse occurs when particles are relativistic .",
    "but the bosonic system is significantly different from the fermionic system because it has no fermi pressure to hinder gravity .",
    "since the bosons are confined inside a sphere with radius @xmath6 , they have zero point energy @xmath17 due to the uncertainty principle in the relativistic limit .",
    "therefore , the typical energy for a boson in a sphere of radius @xmath6 is @xmath18 again , the radius cancels in the critical limit . in this case",
    ", the chandrasekhar limit is @xmath19 comparing eq .",
    "( [ fermionlimit ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ bosonlimit ] ) , we can see that for a given particle mass , a particle that obeys bose - einstein statistics will experience gravitational collapse much more readily than a particle that obeys fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "when the total number of dm particles accumulated in a neutron star surpasses the chandrasekhar limit , the captured dm particles collapse to a black hole and destroy the host neutron star .",
    "therefore , observations of old neutron stars can be used to constrain the dm - neutron scattering cross section .",
    "since bosons have much smaller chandrasekhar limit than fermions , we can obtain stronger limits on bosonic dm . in this work , we take typical neutron star parameters @xmath20 , @xmath21 and the central density @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "the accretion of dm onto stars has been studied in  @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we review the basic formulas for the capture of asymmetric dm in neutron stars .    in the absence of annihilation ,",
    "the number of dm particles in a star is determined by the differential equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the total number of dm particles in the star and @xmath25 is the dm capture rate through scattering with baryons . in this study , we assume there is no symmetric component and neglect dm annihilation completely . in some adm models , a portion of the symmetric component can be regenerated by oscillation effects @xcite . for those models , bounds derived from the survival of the neutron stars",
    "can be weaker .    additionally , we ignore the self - capture effect .",
    "dark matter may have a sizable self - interaction that leads to self - capture  @xcite .",
    "however , the self - capture saturates when the sum of the individual self - scattering cross sections becomes larger than the geometrical area over which the dm particles thermally distribute .",
    "as we will show in the next section , due to the large baryon density the captured dm particles are thermally distributed in a very small region of radius @xmath26 in the core of the neutron star .",
    "we have checked that the baryonic capture always dominates the dm accretion process in neutron stars for the parameter space of interest , even if we take the upper limit of the self - scattering cross section allowed by the elliptical halo shape bound  @xcite .",
    "the number of dm particles in the neutron star is set by @xmath25 .",
    "since neutrons are degenerate in the neutron stars , capture can occur only when the momentum transfer is larger than the difference between the fermi momentum and the neutron momentum .",
    "as we will show , this will affect the capture efficiency significantly for dm with mass less than @xmath2 . for larger dm",
    "mass the effect is negligible , because the momentum transfer is always sizable .",
    "the accretion rate @xmath25 is given by @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the radius of the neutron star and the capture rate per unit volume for an observer at rest with respect to the dm distribution is given by @xmath29.\\ ] ] here @xmath30 is the ambient dm number density ; @xmath31 is the number density of the stellar baryons ; @xmath32 is the dm velocity dispersion around the neutron star ; @xmath33 is the escape velocity of the neutron star at the given radius @xmath34 ; @xmath35 is the effective scattering cross section between dm particles and nucleons in the neutron star ; and @xmath36 takes into account the neutron degeneracy effect on the capture .",
    "the factor @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "now we specify the factor @xmath36 .",
    "all energy levels below the fermi momentum @xmath41 have been occupied . during the scattering process ,",
    "if the momentum transfer to the neutron is larger than @xmath41 , the scattered neutron can be excited above the fermi surface . in this case",
    ", all neutrons can participate the capture process , and the capture efficiency is @xmath42 .",
    "on the other hand , if the momentum transfer @xmath43 is less than @xmath41 , only those neutrons with momentum larger than @xmath44 can participate in the capture process .",
    "the fraction of these neutrons is @xmath45 , so we can approximate @xmath36 as @xmath46 . depending upon the momentum transfer @xmath43 , we can parameterize @xmath36 as @xmath47.\\ ] ] when the dm particle approaches the surface of the neutron star , its velocity is close to the escape velocity .",
    "hence , the typical momentum transfer is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the reduced mass , and typically @xmath50 .",
    "the fermi momentum is @xmath51 for @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , @xmath52 for all @xmath53 .",
    "in contrast , the capture rate is suppressed by a factor @xmath54 if the dm mass smaller than the neutron mass .    to estimate the capture rate , we take the conservative limit that @xmath55 , and we assume that @xmath30 and @xmath31 are independent of the radius ; thus , the total capture rate can be simplified to @xmath56 , \\label{rate}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the total number of neutrons in the host star . when @xmath58 , the term in the square bracket is close to 1 ; for typical values @xmath50 and @xmath59 , and a dm mass smaller than @xmath60 , this condition is obtained . if dm has mass larger than @xmath61 , a lower probability to lose enough kinetic energy to be captured after single scatter results  @xcite . in our numerical work ,",
    "we use the full expression of eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) .",
    "here we only consider dm particles captured by the neutron star itself and neglect those the neutron star can inherit from its progenitor .",
    "compared to the neutron star phase , the progenitor usually has much lower density and shorter lifetime which results in lower capture efficiency .",
    "the total number of dm particles captured by the neutron star is given by the solution of eq .",
    "@xmath62 to evaluate @xmath25 , we note that if the sum of individual nucleon - dm scattering cross sections is larger than the geometric surface area of the star , the capture rate will saturate .",
    "therefore , the capture rate increases with the cumulative nucleon - dm scattering cross section @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the dm - neutron elastic scattering cross section , as long as @xmath65 is smaller than @xmath66 ; that is , we can constrain the individual scattering cross section @xmath64 as long as @xmath64 is less than or equal to @xmath67 . taking typical neutron star parameters @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath21 , we estimate the maximum cross section as  @xcite @xmath68 and the effective cross section is given by @xmath69.\\ ] ] note that since we consider scattering off only one nucleon , this scattering can be regarded as either spin - dependent or spin - independent .",
    "now we can estimate the total number of adm in the neutron star at a given time , using generic parameters @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "in the regime @xmath73 , we have @xmath74 , which gives @xmath75 when the dm mass is less than @xmath76 , the degeneracy effect on the capture process is important so that @xmath77 , and we have @xmath78 it is interesting to note that the dm number does not depend on the dm mass in the second case .    in the above derivation of @xmath24 , we have assumed that the evaporation effect is negligible for the dm .",
    "now we estimate the dm mass scale below which the evaporation is relevant .",
    "since energy states below the fermi surface are occupied , only those neutrons with momentum above @xmath41 can transfer kinetic energy to the dm . since @xmath79 for the neutron star , the number of these free neutrons is order @xmath80 smaller than that of the neutrons in the fermi sea .",
    "so the scattering probability for the dm evaporation is highly suppressed .",
    "furthermore , compared to the sun , neutron stars have much higher density and deeper gravitational wells , so it is much more difficult to accelerate trapped dm above the escape velocity through interactions with neutrons . to evaporate from the neutron star ,",
    "the dm has to gain enough energy such that its velocity is larger than the escape velocity of the neutron star . because of the degeneracy effect",
    ", the typical energy transfer from the free neutron is @xmath81 ; so the evaporation effect is relevant only when the dm mass is less than @xmath82 for @xmath83 , which is much below the lower mass limit of our constraints @xmath84 in the most optimistic case .",
    "therefore , we can safely ignore the evaporation process .",
    "when dm particles are captured by the neutron star they lose energy via scattering with neutrons , and soon attain thermal equilibrium with the star . to estimate the thermalization time scale we calculate the dm energy loss rate : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the neutron number density in the center of the neutron star , @xmath87 is the energy loss of the dm particle during each scattering event , and we use @xmath36 defined as in eq .   to parameterize the neutron degeneracy effect on the dm thermalization process .",
    "the typical velocity and the momentum transfer @xmath88 fully determine @xmath36 .",
    "however , unlike the capture case , where the velocity is set by the escape velocity @xmath89 , the thermal equilibrium of dm particles and neutrons now sets @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the energy after thermalization . in the case of @xmath53 , @xmath92 , which is much smaller than @xmath93 . for @xmath94 ,",
    "the momentum transfer is given by @xmath95 , which is again less than @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the neutron degeneracy effect reduces the dm thermalization efficiency over the entire dm mass range , and @xmath36 is everywhere given by @xmath96 .    to estimate the thermalization time scale , we solve eq .",
    "( [ dedt ] ) and get @xmath97 in the limit of @xmath53 , the thermalization time scale can be further simplified to @xmath98 .",
    "taking typical values , we see @xmath99 if dm mass is less than @xmath2 , the thermalization time scale is given by @xmath100 to derive constraints on scalar adm from black hole formation , we will assume the captured scalar adm follows the thermal distribution in the neutron star .",
    "this is only true when @xmath101 is less than the neutron star age @xmath102 . as we can see from eqs .",
    "( [ coolingheavy ] ) and ( [ coolinglight ] ) , light dm easily satisfies this condition . for heavy dm , @xmath101 is not always less than the neutron star age . in the following discussion",
    "we first assume the dm reaches thermal equilibrium with neutrons , and then we check the consistency of this assumption .    after attaining thermal equilibrium , captured",
    "dm particles drift to the center of the star and form an isothermal distribution with the typical radius @xmath103 we can see that the captured dm particles very quickly occupy a very small region near the neutron star core .",
    "if the dm density is larger than the baryon density within the thermal radius @xmath104 , the dm particles can become self - gravitating . for a total dm mass @xmath105 within a thermal radius @xmath104 ,",
    "this condition is @xmath106 therefore , the dm becomes self - gravitating once the total number of dm particles is larger than a critical number @xmath107 recall the upper limit for the bosonic system given in eq .",
    "( [ bosonlimit ] ) above which the zero point energy can not prevent gravitational collapse @xmath108 thus , if the scalar adm thermalizes and the mass satisfies @xmath109 , we always have @xmath110 . in this case",
    ", gravitational collapse occurs as soon as dm particles become self - gravitating in neutron stars .      in the above discussion",
    ", we implicitly assumed that all captured scalar adm particles followed a maxwellian velocity distribution . at the extreme densities we are considering here , however , this minimal assumption is not necessarily satisfied . in particular , ensembles of bosonic particles at high densities exhibit novel statistical properties .",
    "if the central temperature of the neutron star falls below the critical temperature to form a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , the particles in the ground state condense and no longer follow the thermal distribution .",
    "we will now show that for light adm this condensation increases the density and reduces the restriction on self - gravitation to such an extent that the number of adm particles necessary for self - gravitation is less than the bosonic chandrasekhar limit .",
    "thus , gravitational collapse is set by @xmath111 .    to check this sequence of events ,",
    "we begin by noting that for a given bosonic dm number density @xmath112 , the critical temperature to form a bec is given by @xmath113^{2/3},\\ ] ] where @xmath114 is the riemann - zeta function , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 .",
    "to see how likely it is that the captured adm will form a bec in the neutron star , we can estimate the critical adm number as @xmath117 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ eq : rth ] ) . therefore ,",
    "if the total number of captured adm in the neutron star is larger than @xmath118 , some of captured adm particles will go to the ground state and form a bec .",
    "this condition can be satisfied for a neutron star with relatively low central temperature as indicated by eqs .",
    "( [ nxlarge ] ) and ( [ nxsmall ] ) .    for @xmath119 , the bec forms and the number of particles in the condensed ground state is @xmath120 \\simeq n_x-1.0\\times10^{36}\\left(\\frac{t}{10 ^ 5~{\\rm k}}\\right)^3 . \\label{bec1}\\ ] ]",
    "since these ground - state particles effectively have zero temperature , they sink deep into the core of the neutron star . we can estimate the radius of distribution of the ground state by requiring the zero point energy equal the gravitational energy @xmath121 this is much smaller than @xmath104 , which indicates a much higher dm density .",
    "thus , the ground state itself may become self - gravitating .",
    "the critical number for the self - gravity of the dm particles in the condensed state is @xmath122 once the number of dm particles in the ground state is larger than @xmath123 , these ground - state particles become self - gravitating . since @xmath123 is less than @xmath124 , the onset of self - gravity is marked by @xmath123 instead of @xmath124 in conditions where a bec forms .",
    "as indicated above , this leads to qualitatively different behavior as compared to the case when a bec does not form , since now @xmath123 can be less than @xmath111 .",
    "if this is the case , as soon as a condensed adm system reaches the chandrasekhar limit it will undergo gravitational collapse .    for this effect to be important",
    ", @xmath125 has to grow larger than the chandrasekhar limit for a bosonic system , so that the condition for black hole formation of the bec becomes @xmath126 . by using eq .",
    "( [ bec1 ] ) , we get a lower limit on the total dm number @xmath24 , @xmath127 we can see that the value of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ condbec ] ) is less than @xmath124 if the dm mass @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) for a central temperature @xmath83 ( @xmath130 ) . in the situation where this condensation can occur ,",
    "the bec shortens the time scale for the black hole formation for the scalar adm in the low - mass range .",
    "during the collapse process , the gravitational contraction releases energy which can be absorbed by neutrons through dm - neutron scattering .",
    "this cooling mechanism is so efficient that eventually the dm sphere collapses to a black hole  @xcite .",
    "once a black hole is formed at the center of the neutron star , it will rapidly capture the baryonic matter of the neutron star . hawking radiation",
    "will also be active , reducing the mass of the black hole and possibly heating the remaining dm .",
    "finally , the black hole may also consume the ambient dm particles , which can be crucial for the stability of the black hole . here , we analyze the relative contributions of these effects , and we see that in the majority of our parameter space the black hole will grow and eventually consume the host neutron star .",
    "once the physics of the accretion is properly considered , we find that hawking radiation could be important for high- and intermediate - mass adm .    for a black hole with mass @xmath131 , the differential equation that governs the rate of change of mass is @xmath132 the second term of eq .",
    "( [ bondi ] ) represents the hawking radiation rate , while the third term is the accretion rate of ambient dm particles . the first term of right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ bondi ] ) is the bondi - hoyle accretion rate , in which @xmath133 is the sound speed and @xmath134 is the accretion eigenvalue for the transonic solution . to determine @xmath135 and @xmath134",

    "the accretion constant is given by @xmath143^{-(5 - 3\\gamma)/(2\\gamma-2)}=0.25 $ ] @xcite .",
    "for large adm mass , we found above that @xmath144 and a black hole forms without the assistance of a bec .",
    "after formation of the black hole , the neutron star continues capturing dm particles .",
    "these newly captured dm particles eventually sink to the center of the neutron star and distribute themselves within @xmath104 . in principle , the black hole can increase its mass by capturing these additional dm particles .",
    "however , we find that this capture rate is very small and @xmath145 is negligible .",
    "this is because , for a nonrelativistic particle moving towards the black hole , its impact parameter must be less than @xmath146  @xcite to penetrate the angular momentum barrier and fall into the black hole . here",
    ", @xmath147 is the particle s velocity when it is far away from the black hole .",
    "taking @xmath148 and @xmath149 , we can estimate @xmath150 as @xmath151 which is much smaller than the thermal radius @xmath152 .",
    "therefore the majority of dm particles captured after formation of the black hole do not fall directly into the black hole .",
    "the remaining dm particles orbit the black hole at a distance of order @xmath104 ; the black hole gains mass from these particles at a rate set by the collisionless spherical accretion approximation  @xcite .",
    "we find that the dm accretion rate is much less than the baryon accretion rate , so we can safely ignore the @xmath145 term in this case , and we obtain a critical initial black hole mass @xmath153 without a bec , the initial black hole mass is @xmath154 . if we demand @xmath155 , we find that for @xmath156 the hawking radiation has a longer time scale than the accretion process .",
    "hence in this mass range the black hole will continuously accrete baryonic matter until the neutron star is consumed entirely .      for low - mass adm , particles in the bec ground state form a black hole .",
    "we must check the mass above which the black hole evaporates . if we naively ignore the term @xmath145 and demand @xmath157 , we find that the black hole mass increases only for the dm mass less than @xmath158 .",
    "if so , the constraint is valid for @xmath159 .",
    "but in contrast to the non - bec case , @xmath145 may have an important effect on the black hole mass evolution , and we find that the bound can be sensitive to masses higher than @xmath158 .",
    "we detail our reasoning below .    since the black hole forms only from adm particles in the ground state , the remaining adm particles follow an isothermal distribution with a radius @xmath104 .",
    "as discussed above , the thermally distributed dm particles do not fall into the black hole , and so the phase space of the non - bec state is still completely occupied .",
    "hence , if any more adm particles are introduced to the thermal region , a new bec ground state must form in the center of the star . in this way ,",
    "the introduction of more dm particles into the thermal radius essentially forces the formation of a bec ground state . before and after the mini black hole forms",
    ", the neutron star continuously captures adm particles .",
    "all of the captured adm particles will eventually thermalize , sink to the center of the neutron star , and prompt the formation of a new bec state .",
    "if the thermalization time scale is shorter than the evaporation time scale of the mini black hole , the black hole can always efficiently accrete adm particles in the new bec state . taking the initial black hole mass as @xmath160",
    ", we can conservatively estimate the black hole evaporation time scale in the absence of particle accretion as @xmath161 .",
    "this is much longer than the thermalization time scale given in eq .",
    "( [ coolingheavy ] ) . since all newly captured adm particles eventually go to the ground state after the amount of time it takes them to thermalize , the rate at which adm particles fall into the bec ground state per unit time is given by the capture rate @xmath25 . to check whether or not the adm particles in the bec state feed the black hole efficiently we calculate the maximal impact parameter @xmath150 and compare it with the distribution radius @xmath162 . with @xmath163 and @xmath164 , we have @xmath165 where @xmath162 is given by eq .",
    "( [ rbec ] ) . since @xmath166 , we see that the black hole can efficiently consume the bec .",
    "this occurs at a rate given by @xmath167 : @xmath168 this new source of accretion overwhelms the hawking radiation , which is emitted at the rate @xmath169 .",
    "thus , in the bec case our constraints can be sensitive to scalar adm with mass much higher than the naive estimate , @xmath170 .    in this discussion",
    ", we have assumed that the black hole formation and hawking radiation do not destroy the bec state .",
    "however , one may note that the black hole radiates as a blackbody at a very high temperature , @xmath171 . if this hawking radiation is emitted solely as relativistic particles of the standard model such as photons and neutrinos , these particles will heat the neutrons which in turn heat the adm . we may estimate the change in neutron temperature by assuming that all of the initial rest mass energy of the black hole goes into heat .",
    "we see that in this case equipartition of energy requires that @xmath172 , and there is no change in the thermal adm distribution .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the energy produced by the hawking radiation is efficiently transferred to dm particles , the situation may change .",
    "for example , the dm may couple to some light mediator particles , which can be produced by the hawking radiation .",
    "these light mediators may heat the adm directly and transfer the black hole energy to the thermal energy of adm particles . in this case , the calculation is rather complicated and a detailed analysis is beyond the scope of the current paper .",
    "here we give a conservative estimate by assuming that all of the initial black hole mass goes to the thermal energy of dm particles .",
    "the equipartition of energy gives @xmath173 , where the number of remaining non - bec particles is @xmath174 , from eq . .",
    "this heating will greatly affect the thermal distribution of the scalar adm particles .",
    "since @xmath175 , the phase space will expand greatly , and the newly captured adm particles do not form the bec state . thus ,",
    "the black hole constraints are lifted in this case .    in practice , for heating processes to occur , adm particles must couple to light mediator particles , since the black hole can only produce particles with mass much less than @xmath176 . on the other hand , the presence of the light mediator may also give rise to dm self - interactions , and the observed ellipticity of dm halos places a lower bound on the mediator mass  @xcite . as an example , if @xmath170 , the halo shape constraint requires the mediator mass be larger than @xmath177  @xcite . thus , for scalar adm with mass @xmath178 the existence of a mediator with mass in the range @xmath179 may help in evading the black hole formation constraints , while remaining consistent with the halo shape bound .",

    "<S> we also note that in some portions of this constrained parameter space , nontrivial effects from hawking radiation can modify our limits . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for scalar adm with mass between 5 mev and 13 gev , the constraint from nearby neutron stars on the scattering cross section with neutrons ranges from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .    </S>",
