    "this source is only about 1.4 degrees away and it is usually a problem for the analysis of ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  with non - imaging detectors . the energy spectrum of the source is produced combining all the isgri data in the 13 kev  1.0 mev band . since we note that the sky region around ls i + 61@xmath7 303 is rather crowded and ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  itself is relatively faint in hard x - rays , it is necessary to obtain the energy spectrum from the mosaic images ( see also chernyakova & neronov 2008 ) .",
    "the energy spectrum is well fitted by a power law shape , with a photon index of 1.7@xmath30.2 and normalization of 3.1@xmath8@xmath910@xmath10ph @xmath11 s@xmath12 kev@xmath12 .",

    "the orbital lightcurve is then made by using the radio period and a reference time at mjd=43366.275 ( gregory 2002 ) at the hard x - rays , so that the absolute orbital phases can be directly compared with those at other frequencies ( and we do this below ) .",
    "we find that at the hard x - rays the maxima is around phase 0.5 - 0.6 whereas the periastron of the system is at around 0.25 - 0.3 ( casares et al .",

    "corrected exposures after cuts changed from 273 to 578 ks .",
    "the difference in the amount of data analyzed allows for a much more detailed _ integral _ lightcurve to be constructed , as can be visually seen in panel 3 of figure 4 above , where we show the chernyakova , neronov & walter ( 2006 ) 20 - 60 kev lightcurve in the background , and our current results superposed .",
    "our analysis of _",
    "integral_/isgri data results in the first direct orbital period determination through a power spectrum analysis of the hard x - ray data of ls  i  + 61@xmath0303 , although not yet truly significant , and in a spectrum at hard x - rays which is similar to the previous report ( chernyakova , neronov & walter 2006 ) , but with detection significance improved to 12.0@xmath1 , meaning that the source did not show significant changes in hard x - rays along the last five years .",
    "our analysis also confirms that in the case of ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  there is no high - energy cut - off found at energies below 100 kev , as it would be common in conventional accretion scenarios .",
    "indeed , if the system is an accreting neutron star or black hole , one expects to find a cut - off power - law spectrum in the hard x - ray band with a cut - off energy normally at 10  60 kev for neutron stars ( e.g. , filippova et al . 2005 ) and at @xmath2100 kev for black holes ( mcclintock & remillard 2003 ) .",
    "even when one can think of situations where the accretion disk is masked by a jet component , producing a featureless power law , if the accretion flow and the jet would give comparable contributions in the hard x - ray band , one would still expect at least a feature in the integral energy range , due to the disappearance of of contribution of the disk at high energies",
    ". such is not observed , and thus , in case an accretion disk is present , its contribution should be sub - dominant with respect to the jet one .",

    "if most of it comes from a jet , and since in the scenario being discussion the whole source activity would be powered by accretion , the luminosity ( @xmath18 erg s@xmath12 , of the order of the gamma - ray luminosity ) could only be explained by a large beaming factor . from @xmath250 mas resolution radio images of ls",

    "however , recent very long baseline array ( vlba ) imaging obtained by dhawan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) over a full orbit of ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  has shown the radio emission to come from angular scales smaller than about 7  mas ( which is a projected size of 14 au at an assumed distance of 2  kpc ) .",
    "no large features or high - velocity flows were noted in any of the observing days , which implies at least a non - permanent jet nature .",
    "changes within 3 hours were found to be insignificant , so the velocity of the outflow can not be much over 0.05@xmath20 .",
    "the magic collaboration also conducted a radio campaign ( in concurrence with tev observations ) to test these results using again merlin in the uk , the european vlbi network ( evn ) , and the vlba in the usa ( albert et al .",
    "the results obtained by radio imaging at different angular scales show that the size of the radio emitting region of ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  is constrained to be below @xmath26  mas ( @xmath212 projected au ) , and the presence of persistent jets above this scale is therefore excluded . as in the case of dhawan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , these observations have shown a radio - emitting region extending east - southeast from the brighter , unresolved emitting core . the outflow velocity implied by these observations is @xmath21 .",
    "these values of @xmath22 would result too low to significantly increase the luminosity ( @xmath23 ) even if strong jet precession is assumed . finally , search for lines with the chandra observatory yielded to no evidence for absorption or emission features in the source averaged and time - resolved spectra ( rea et al .",
    "2010 ) . putting the _ integral _ observations in this context , we find no obvious support for the accretion model in our data .    as can be seen in figure 4 , the hard x - ray emission peaks in phase around 0.5 , and in order to compare with the orbital phase derived at @xmath4-rays , we have also generated the orbital light curves of _ r_xte / pca and _ r_xte / asm using the currently available observations .",
    "the orbital peaks of the soft and hard x - rays are close in phase ( 0.4 - 0.6 ) but not co - aligned .",
    "thus , with low statistics , the hard x - rays may appear following the overall orbital modulation trend of the soft x - rays ( e.g. see harrison et al .",
    "we also show in figure 4 the lightcurves obtained by fermi ( abdo et al .",
    "2009 , 8 months of observations since launch in june 2008 ) , and magic ( several orbits put together , along few years of observations , as described in albert et al .",
    "2009 ) . direct inspection of these lightcurves seem to indicate that the hard x - ray component peaks in between the average soft x - ray and tev lightcurves , but significant variability ( e.g. , orbit to orbit variability is already seen in magic and veritas data , albert et al .",
