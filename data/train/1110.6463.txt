    "the two 0.1200gev flares in oj287 allow us to assess the correspondence between @xmath1-ray and lower - frequency variations .",
    "we find that two kinds of events at millimeter wavelengths are related to these @xmath1-ray outbursts at high significance : ( 1 ) the early , rising phases of the two most luminous 1 mm flares ever detected in this blazar , ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) ; and ( 2 ) two sharp increases to unprecedented levels of linear polarization ( @xmath38% and @xmath39% ) in bright jet feature c1 @xmath3pc from the central engine",
    ". these events also coincide with : ( 3 ) two sharp optical flares ; ( 4 ) two peaks in optical polarization of @xmath40% ; and ( 5 ) the similarity of optical and mm - wave polarization position angle both during and between the flares at @xmath34-@xmath35 .",
    "the exceptionally high polarization of c1 during @xmath1-ray flare @xmath20 provides extremely strong evidence that the event occurred in c1 .",
    "the @xmath1-ray ic emission arises , in principle , from either the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) process or ic scattering of infrared radiation from a hot , dusty torus of size @xmath41  pc ( ic / dust ) .",
    "ic scattering from the broad line region is not possible given the long distance of the @xmath1-ray dissipation region that we measure .",
    "an ssc model is possible given the low ratio of @xmath1-ray to synchrotron luminosity ( @xmath42 in oj287 , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , infrared emission from the dusty torus has not been detected thus far in bl  lacs such as oj287 , as far as the authors know .",
    "we thus favor the ssc mechanism ( see @xcite for further arguments ) .",
    "the observed behavior agrees with a scenario in which the optical and @xmath1-ray flares are produced in c1 by particle acceleration in a moving blob when it crosses a standing shock well beyond the acz ( see @xcite for a sketch ) . @xcite",
    "have associated the innermost mm - wave jet emission feature with a recollimation shock at the end of the acz .",
    "we identify c0 as such a feature , and c1 as a second re - collimation shock , as seen in hydrodynamical simulations @xcite and often in vlba images @xcite .",
    "the blob is a turbulent plasma disturbance ( typical weakness of the observed polarization outside the high polarization peaks ) that propagates down the jet with significantly higher relativistic electron density and magnetic field than in the ambient flow .",
    "@xcite shows that , in this case , the side of the conical shock nearest to the line of sight can be highly polarized with @xmath25 parallel to the jet axis .",
    "the remainder of the conical shock , farther from the line of sight , has much lower polarization .",
    "because of light - travel delays , we first see the blob penetrate the near side , and therefore observe a major increase in polarization .",
    "as the outburst develops , more of the emission comes from the low - polarization far side , which decreases @xmath24 while the mm - wave flux density continues to increase .",
    "this is the pattern observed during both flares .",
    "the mm - wave and optical flares start at essentially the same time as the magnetic field and electron energies near the leading edge of the blob become amplified as they pass the standing shock front .",
    "the mm - wave flux outburst continues as the relatively low - energy electrons fill the shocked region .",
    "the optical and @xmath1-ray emission , produced by higher - energy electrons that can not travel far before suffering radiative energy losses , is confined closer to the shock front where particles are accelerated .",
