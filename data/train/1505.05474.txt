    "the as - as interlayer distance decreases rapidly with pressure up to 4 gpa .",

    "it has been suggested that one of the main structural differences between t and ct phases is the value of the as - fe - as tetrahedral angles .",
    "both tetrahedral angles change abruptly during the phase transition from a value very close ( t ) to a value far away ( ct ) from the ideal tetrahedral angle ( 109.5@xmath7 ) .",
    "since @xmath3 decreases with increasing deviation from the ideal tetrahedral angles , it has been concluded that this is crucial for superconductivity although the direct link and the underling mechanism which correlates tetrahedral angles and superconductivity is not clear .",
    "recent theoretical studies @xcite were focused on the change in interatomic distances under pressure , mainly on the interlayer as - as distance(noted as as - as ( c ) in fig .",
    "this distance has been predicted to decrease abruptly with pressure , reaching a value that is very close to the as - as covalent bond distance in the ct phase .",
    "consequently it has been proposed that the transition to the ct phase is induced by formation of a direct as - as interlayer bond and a weakening of the in - plane fe - fe @xcite and fe - as bonds @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that in the case of 111 superconductors ( e.g. ref @xcite ) the fe - as - fe layers are separated by two layers of cations ( see fig .",
    ", an interaction between as atoms of different layers is hindered and only intralayer modifications can affect superconductivity .    the spin - state of fe is the key parameter which controls as - as bonding and consequently the lattice parameters @xcite . under compression the magnetic moment of fe decreases and consequently , the strength of the fe - as bonding ( see fig . 4 of ref .",
    "this is also evident from our calculations , see fig .",
    "the results of our calculations suggest that the ct phase is magnetic @xmath42 the fe magnetic moment is not vanished but suppressed after the transformation decreasing the strength of the fe - as bonding in agreement with softening of the @xmath25 raman mode ( fig .",
    "the structural changes determined in this paper ( fig .",
    "7 ) clearly support this scenario .",
    "a direct consequence of the as 5-fold coordination is that the system loses its two - dimensionality ( fig .",
    "6(b ) ) , and with it , superconductivity .",
    "moreover the weakening of the in - plane fe - fe bonds @xcite in the ct phase also decreases superconductivity .",
    "as@xmath0 as a function of pressure.,title=\"fig:\",width=377 ]",
    "from our data we find that the tetrahedral angles change continuously with pressure ( inset fig .",
    "7 ) in a manner very similar to that determined previously in cafe@xmath2as@xmath2 @xcite and also predicted by theory @xcite . during the initial compression the a - axis expands and the @xmath20-axis rapidly decreases due to the development of the as - as interlayer bonding and this keeps fe - as distances almost constant .",
    "in addition the tetrahedral angles are close to , or even approach , the ideal value .",
    "above p@xmath43 the tetrahedral angles take value away from the ideal because @xmath12-axis stops to increase to mediate the @xmath20-axis decrease .",
    "so , the correlation between the deviation of tetrahedral angles and @xmath3 turns out to be a side effectof the change of as atom position with increasing pressure which primary affect @xmath3 . in conclusion",
