    "experiments investigating quantum degenerate atomic gases have seen tremendous progress over the past two decades . as many new and complex experimental techniques for scientific exploration have been implemented , there is continued interest in the simplification of methods for the production of quantum degenerate samples .",
    "in particular , quantum gases have been widely studied with lithium and potassium as they both have fermionic and bosonic isotopes .",
    "for these two species there is the additional difficulty that standard subdoppler laser cooling is absent or inefficient .",
    "however , more recently alternative types of laser cooling like narrowline cooling @xcite and gray optical molasses techniques @xcite were successfully demonstrated .",
    "this lead to significantly improved phasespace densities after laser cooling and the improved alloptical production of quantum degenerate samples .",
    "especially , the loading of the atoms into optical dipole traps can be improved , as this typically suffers from insufficient matching of trapping volumes and depths . for the case that efficient laser cooling can not be attained , methods like high - power laser based traps @xcite or resonator enhanced dipole traps @xcite for larger trap depth and volume were previously developed .",
    "another important aspect is the transport of the atomic clouds over long distances facilitating advanced techniques in manipulating and probing ultracold gases that require good optical or mechanical access .",
    "this mitigates constraints generally imposed by magnetooptical trapping and precooling .",
    "several transport methods were developed , which include the translation of magnetic traps @xcite and optical tweezers @xcite , as well as @xmath10 moving optical lattices @xcite . in most of these experimental schemes the confinement of the atoms is optimized for the transport itself , which requires different measures for the loading of the atoms into the optical dipole trap and subsequent optimized evaporative cooling @xcite .",
    "here we present an apparatus for the efficient production of a large quantum degenerate sample of fermionic lithium .",
    "our experimental approach is based on our previous work on efficient narrow - line laser cooling and trapping on a transition in the ultraviolet ( uv ) regime @xcite . due to the small linewidth",
    ", temperatures are achieved that lie well below the doppler limit for standard cooling on the d2 transition resulting in high phase - space density samples in addition , the cooling remains effective when the sample is loaded into an optical dipole trap , and hence high loading efficiencies are obtained .",
    "we employ a smallangle crossed beam trapping geometry with a large volume , leading to good loading efficiencies from the ultraviolet magneto - optical trap ( uv mot ) , while simultaneously offering a suitable axial confinement for a fast transport of the atomic cloud . with this simple extension of the single",
    "beam optical tweezers method no further optical trapping steps are needed , such as a resonator enhanced odt @xcite or a transfer between subsequent odts of decreasing volume @xcite .",
    "our trapping configuration is used to transport the atoms into a science cell in order to facilitate good optical access .",
    "furthermore , the optical confinement is sufficient for efficient evaporation of the trapped atoms into the quantum degenerate regime . to underline the overall performance of this approach",
    "we present the production of a large boseeinstein condensate ( bec ) of feshbach molecules .",
    "the atoms are loaded from a zeemanslowed atomic beam into a mot on the d2 transition .",
    "the atomic cloud is further cooled and compressed on the narrow uv transition and then transferred into a crossed odt comprising of two laser beams focused by a single lens .",
    "subsequently , the atomic cloud is transported from the mot chamber into an attached fused silica cell by moving the lens with an air bearing stage .",
    "a magnetic bias field is applied to access a feshbach resonance for efficient evaporation of the atomic cloud into the quantum degenerate regime.,width=302 ]    our experimental sequence for the production of a quantum degenerate @xmath11 gas starts with a twostage mot , which was described in @xcite . at first",
    ", we employ a standard mot on the @xmath12 transition to obtain a large number of atoms .",
    "this is followed by doppler cooling on the narrow uv @xmath0 transition at @xmath13 with a natural linewidth of the excited state of @xmath14 .",
    "after this twostage mot , we typically obtain a @xmath11 cloud containing around @xmath15 atoms at a temperature of @xmath16k with a central density on the order of @xmath17 .    in the next step",
    "the atoms are transferred into a crossed optical dipole trap that comprises of two beams intersecting at a small angle .",
    "the laser wavelength of @xmath18 for the optical dipole trap is near a magic wavelength , where the differential ac stark shift of the uv mot transition vanishes @xcite .",
    "this permits continued cooling on the uv transition during the initial stage of optical trapping and allows to take full advantage of the high phasespace density of the uv mot .    after loading we",
    "transport the atoms into a small glass cell attached to the mot vacuum chamber as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lithiumsetup ] .",
    "as the atoms are loaded from a zeemanslowed atomic beam , the vacuum background is low and no differential pumping stage between the mot and science cell is required .",
    "this allows the use of a linear optical transport .",
    "our particular scheme demonstrates the displacement of a crossed optical dipole trap across a long distance , realized with an air bearing translation stage .",
    "this is a key feature of our simplified experimental approach , as efficient direct loading from the mot , lossfree nearadiabatic transport , and efficient evaporative cooling are achieved in the same trap .",
    "evaporative cooling of the atomic cloud is performed in the science cell with a spin mixture of the two energetically lowest zeeman levels @xmath19 , commonly referred to as states @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in order to tune the swave scattering length @xmath22 , magnetic bias fields of up to",
    "@xmath23 can be applied . for this work evaporative cooling",
    "is either carried out near the broad feshbach resonance at @xmath24 @xcite to create a strongly interacting fermi quantum gas in the becbcs crossover regime @xcite , or at around @xmath25 to obtain a weakly interacting fermi gas .",
    "the power for odt is derived from a single mode @xmath18 fiber laser ( ipg , ylr501070lp ) operated at a fixed nominal output power of @xmath26 , that is equally split into two beams for the crossed odt . for each beam",
    "the power is regulated by an acoustooptic modulator ( aom ) .",
    "the crossed odt is formed by focusing the two collimated parallel beams with @xmath27 waist of @xmath28 using a single @xmath29 lens , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : lithiumsetup ] .",
    "the beams are symmetrically displaced by @xmath30 from the center of the lens , leading to a crossing angle of @xmath31 degrees .",
    "this angle is determined under the geometric constraint of the aperture of the vacuum viewport .",
    "the two beams intersect near their foci , which have a waist of @xmath32 .",
    "we observed a slight power dependent astigmatism .",
    "in contrast to a single beam dipole trap , this has a negligible effect on the position of the odt during forced evaporation , as the axial position of the trap is predominantly defined by the crossing of the two beams .",
    "the full trap depth @xmath33 of the crossed trap with @xmath34 per beam is @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the boltzmann constant , and the axial and radial trap frequencies are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the trap frequencies were experimentally determined by observing the center of mass oscillations of the atomic cloud after a displacement from the trap center , induced by a magnetic field gradient pulse . from a series of such measurements we obtained the scaling of the trap frequencies with the power per beam @xmath39 of the odt , given by @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "hence , the effect of the power dependence of the astigmatism on the trap frequencies were found to be negligible .",
    "all relevant parameters of the odt are summarized in table  [ tab : transporttable ] .",
    ".parameters of the implemented crossed odt are compared to calculated values for a single beam configuration with identical total optical power and axial confinement . as reference",
    "the respective values are listed for an optical trap geometry used for transport as reported in ref .",
    "the values given for our crossed trap include small effects of imperfect alignment . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : transporttable ]    for the transfer of the atoms into the crossed odt",
    ", the optical power is linearly ramped up within @xmath42 to the full trap depth during the compressed uv mot phase .",
    "as described in @xcite , the peak density reaches a transient maximum value during this stage , at which point the ramp - up is initiated . after a combined loading and cooling duration of @xmath43 , the uv mot is switched off by extinguishing the repumping light @xmath44 in advance of the cooling light .",
    "this optically pumps the atoms into the @xmath45 hyperfine ground state manifold , creating an incoherent balanced mixture of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 states . for this work the uv mot",
    "is realized with the repumping light tuned to the @xmath12 transition for reasons of stability in switching the optical power for hyperfine pumping .",
    "employing the uv repumping light instead , leads to a very similar loading efficiency .    immediately after the loading we find an atom number of @xmath46 , which corresponds to a transfer efficiency of approximately @xmath47",
    "the temperature is observed to be anisotropic with a geometric mean of @xmath48 .",
    "this results in an initial ratio of @xmath49 of the trap depth to the temperature of the atomic cloud , referred to as the truncation parameter . following the loading of the atoms into the odt we allow for @xmath50 of plain evaporation . for the purpose of thermalization a magnetic bias field of approximately @xmath51",
    "is applied , generated by inverting the polarity of one of the mot coils .",
    "this tunes the swave scattering length to @xmath52 between the two states @xcite , where @xmath53 is bohr s radius .",
    "after plain evaporation the odt typically contains a total number of atoms of @xmath54 at a temperature of @xmath55 corresponding to @xmath56 .",
    "the fermi temperature is defined as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the mean trap frequency and @xmath59 is the reduced planck constant .",
    "we estimate a systematic uncertainty of @xmath60 in all measured quantities .",
    "we investigated the effect of the detuning of the uv light on the loading efficiency of the optical dipole trap .",
    "[ fig : nvsdetuning ]  ( a ) shows the atom number yield at the end of the plain evaporation stage for three different magnetic field gradients of the compressed uv mot . as the cloud thermalizes to the same temperature for all relevant detunings , the phasespace density follows the same curve .",
    "the uv frequency detuning of @xmath61 for maximum atom number differs from the detuning for the maximum phasespace density of the uv mot , that was found to be @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "the residual differential ac stark shift of the cooling transition induced by the @xmath63 light can not explain this difference , as it is small and increases the @xmath0 transition frequency @xcite .",
    "we attribute the observed difference to enhanced lightassisted collisional loss on the uv transition , as the density is strongly increased in the presence of the optical dipole trap . in this case",
    ", the highest atom number is achieved for a larger laser detuning , which leads to a lower photon scattering rate and therefore a reduced atom loss from the trap .",
    "the duration of the combined cooling and optical dipole trapping phase affects the loading efficiency , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nvsdetuning ]  ( b ) .",
    "initially the atom number increases significantly with the overlap duration , demonstrating the efficiency of uv cooling in presence of the @xmath64 trap light .",
    "after a few ms the atom number saturates and remains constant for about @xmath65 .",
    "we assume that during this time the influx of atoms from the uv mot into the odt is approximately balanced with twobody losses occurring at high densities @xcite .    furthermore , we investigated the dependence of the transferred number of atoms on the optical power that is used to drive the uv mot transition .",
    "a reduction from the typically used @xmath66 for the @xmath67 retroreflected beams shows that the experiment is not operated in the saturated regime . remarkably , we find that even with just @xmath68 of total uv power , an atom number of @xmath69 is obtained in the optical trap before plain evaporation .",
    "for comparison we note that loading the odt directly from the red compressed mot , less than @xmath70 atoms are transferred .    in an effort to further improve the initial phasespace density in the odt",
    ", we utilized an additional trapping beam to enhance the confinement of the trap during the uv cooling stage .",
    "for this purpose the frequency of one of the odt beams is shifted by @xmath71 and directed back into the chamber to cross the existing trap under an angle of @xmath72 .",
    "the additional beam has a maximum power of @xmath73 and a waist of @xmath74 at the focus .",
    "this enhances the trap depth to around @xmath75 and the axial trap frequency to @xmath76 .",
    "however , with this configuration we find that the temperature along the axial direction of the atomic cloud before plain evaporation is increased by a factor of @xmath77 , despite the continued uv cooling .",
    "furthermore , after plain evaporation we found only a negligible enhancement of the phasespace density of the atomic cloud .",
    "a possible reason is the interference between the odt beams , as their polarizations are no longer mutually orthogonal and a spurious moving optical lattice is formed .     in the odt",
    "after plain evaporation as a function of the laser detuning with respect to the uv cooling transition for different axial magnetic field gradients of the mot .",
    "the highest atom number is achieved with a detuning of @xmath78 at a gradient of @xmath79 .",
    "an increase of the magnetic field gradient beyond this value does not further improve the atom number .",
    "( b ) atom number vs. duration of continued uv cooling after the odt is ramped up to full power .",
    "the initial increase in atom number demonstrates the effectiveness of uv cooling in presence of the @xmath80 trapping light , while the decrease at longer overlap durations is attributed to density dependent losses ( see text ) .",
    "the error bars account for the statistical uncertainty.,width=302 ]",
    "we realized a rapid long - distance transport of the atomic cloud over @xmath81 in @xmath82 from the mot chamber into the fused silica cell .",
    "this is implemented by moving the lens that simultaneously focuses and crosses the beams for the odt by means of a compact air bearing translation stage ( nelson air corp . , atlas101310hd stage ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lithiumsetup ] . for this configuration",
    "we ensure that the laser beams before the lens are aligned parallel to the direction of translation , so that the trapping geometry is maintained throughout the transport .    in order to realize the transport free of heating and excitation of center of mass oscillations , the trajectory is defined by a symmetric scurve velocity profile . the acceleration is linearly increased to @xmath83 in @xmath84 leading to a maximum velocity of @xmath85 , directly followed by the deceleration .",
    "the large maximum acceleration in use is taking advantage of the strong axial confinement of the crossed optical dipole trap , as compared to single beam traps with comparable waist .",
    "the transport duration is only bound by technical limitations of the translation stage .    during the transport",
    "the optical power remains at the initial @xmath86 per beam .",
    "the measured heating rate for the trap kept stationary in the mot chamber is @xmath87 , which is in good agreement with an estimate based on the spontaneous photon scattering rate @xmath88 at this optical power @xcite .",
    "as the observed heating rate is small compared to the initial temperature , a forced evaporation stage in the mot chamber in order to reduce the optical power during the transport is therefore not required .",
    "we did not observe any significant additional heating or atom loss due to the transport , as compared to keeping the atomic cloud stationary . in order to measure low heating rates ,",
    "the atomic cloud was first evaporatively cooled , and the temperature was measured after multiple repetitions of the transport trip in a single run . from this measurement a small additional heating rate of approximately @xmath89 induced by a single transport at full optical power was determined .",
    "table  [ tab : transporttable ] shows the parameters of our crossed beam transport configuration in comparison with a transport based on a single beam optical dipole trap .",
    "if equal laser power and axial confinement strength are assumed the crossed beam trap offers the advantage of larger beam diameters for an enhanced loading efficiency @xcite , and an improved aspect ratio . with the availability of efficient cooling in the uv mot the larger volume of the crossed beam configuration",
    "is favored over the larger trap depth of the single beam trap for the loading process .",
    "the larger photon scattering rate of the single beam trap can be avoided by using less power . however , to maintain the same axial confinement and to limit the aspect ratio , an even smaller beam waist is required in this case .",
    "using such a low trapping volume configuration then requires additional measures to obtain a good loading efficiency @xcite .",
    "in the following we describe how quantum degeneracy in the trapped lithium sample is achieved in the same crossed beam configuration as previously used for capturing atoms from the uv mot and for optical transport . for this trap",
    "we give examples of optimized evaporative cooling schemes for the cases of weak and strong interactions in the fermi gas .    to produce a weakly interacting quantum",
    "degenerate fermi gas , we apply a magnetic bias field of @xmath90 to increase the @xmath91 swave scattering length to @xmath92 @xcite . to reduce the trap depth @xmath93 for forced evaporation",
    ", we reduce the optical power by means of aoms , which are introduced into each of the two beams . logarithmic photodetectors and high bandwidth pid regulators allow the stabilization and control of the optical power over four orders of magnitude .    the timedependent trap depth during evaporation follows the theoretical curve @xmath94 resulting in a constant truncation parameter @xmath95 throughout the evaporation process @xcite .",
    "we use a time constant of @xmath96 , which is experimentally optimized for maximum atom number , and @xmath97 corresponding to a truncation parameter of @xmath98 .    to characterize the evaporation we probe the atomic cloud at various intermediate optical powers during the ramp . for this purpose ,",
    "the magnetic field and the optical potential are rapidly switched off and the density distribution is determined by standard timeofflight ( tof ) absorption imaging .",
    "the projected density profiles are fitted to a fermi distribution function , from which we extract atom number , temperature , and @xmath99 .",
