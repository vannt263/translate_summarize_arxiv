    "although the fractional quantum hall effect is originally a two - dimensional phenomenon @xcite , multi - layer systems have been studied as natural development @xcite .",
    "multi - layer systems show some unusual effects because of new additional degrees of freedom , namely the inter - layer coulomb interaction and the inter - layer electron tunneling .",
    "for example , in the case of the simplest double - layer system , the `` even denominator '' fractional quantum hall effect with the landau level filling @xmath2 has been observed @xcite , and is interpreted in terms of halperin s @xmath3 state @xcite .    one may then naturally ask what happens in infinite multi - layer systems .",
    "experimentally , the integer quantum hall effect is observed in a 30-layer gaas / algaas superlattice system @xcite and also in organic conductors @xmath4 @xcite and bedt - ttf salts @xcite .",
    "motivated by these works we study the ground state of the infinite - layer system under a strong magnetic field and discuss quantum phase transitions between incompressible and compressible states .",
    "we can have the following naive expectation in advance of quantitative analysis : in the limit of infinite inter - layer distance @xmath5 , layers are completely independent of each other and the laughlin state is realized for appropriate fillings , e.g. @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an odd integer .",
    "however for @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the magnetic length , other fractional quantum hall states can be realized because of the inter - layer coulomb interaction .",
    "furthermore three - dimensional states are also realizable with increasing electron tunnelings between layers .",
    "the fractional quantum hall states are incompressible , but the last three - dimensional state is compressible because the bloch states are formed perpendicular to layers and the fermi surface should appear . therefore a transition between incompressible and compressible states is expected at a certain value of @xmath5 , provided that @xmath5 is a variable parameter .    based on the above expectation we introduce three typical trial states for the ground state with the lowest landau level filling @xmath10 and compute energies of them in order to find which one is the ground state . under a strong magnetic field",
    "we restrict the single - particle states within the lowest landau level , and consider only the coulomb energy and tunneling energy .",
    "we calculate the coulomb energy by the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) method for the two - dimensional trial states @xcite , while the hartree - fock approximation is used for the three - dimensional trial state .",
    "we consider a system with the area @xmath11 of each layer and the height @xmath12 as shown in fig .",
    "[ config ] .",
    "the total number @xmath13 of layers is given by @xmath14 .",
    "then , with the total number @xmath15 of electrons in the system , we define the electron number per layer @xmath16 by @xmath17 . taking into account the layer structure of the system",
    ", we assume the positive charge distribution @xmath18 this positive charge density corresponds to the uniform distribution in each layer and the discrete distribution along the layer . under a magnetic field",

    "we may deal with only the lowest landau level ( lll ) explicitly and neglect higher levels .",
    "we will discuss possible ground states in the subspace of the lll in the following .",
    "now we write down the hamiltonian of the system with @xmath26 as @xmath27 here the one - body part is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the effective masses in the layer and along the @xmath31-direction respectively . the squared effective charge @xmath32 is defined by use of the dielectric constant @xmath33 as @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 is the binding potential of electrons to layers ( like a multi square well potential ) .",
    "we choose two types of configuration as follows : one is the circular shape and the other is the rectangular shape .",

    "we adopt for this geometry the periodic boundary condition in the @xmath31-direction .",
    "this geometry is convenient for description of two - dimensional states and also convenient for the vmc calculation @xcite .",

    "namely with @xmath43 this positive charge distribution tends to the uniform one in the infinite - size limit .",
    "we now discuss the coulomb potential with periodic boundary condition along the @xmath31-axis .",
    "taking account of mirror images we obtain the potential as @xmath44^{1/2}}.\\ ] ] the summation over @xmath45 is divergent logarithmically .",

    "we introduce three trial states for the ground states with @xmath10 of the hamiltonians ( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) and ( [ hamiltonian2 ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , we take ( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) for states without the tunneling ( two - dimensional states ) and ( [ hamiltonian2 ] ) for states with the tunneling ( three - dimensional states ) . here",
    "we remark on the index of position coordinates .",
    "the position coordinates in the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) have the index @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) of electrons .",
    "however when we refer to two - dimensional states , we make the position coordinates have the layer index additionally because electrons belonging to different layers are distinguishable .",

    "we call the state ( [ mltlaughlin ] ) the `` multi - laughlin state '' .",
    "it is the direct product of the laughlin state with @xmath10 @xcite in each layer and is expected to be stable for a large inter - layer distance : @xmath98 .",
    "the second trial state is also a two - dimensional one without the tunneling .",

    "this state is expected to be stable for @xmath101 where the inter - layer coulomb interaction becomes comparable to the intra - layer one .",
    "the numbers ( 111 ) indicate the exponents of the jastrow factor which controls the strength of the electron correlation .",
    "the first `` 1 '' is the exponent of the jastrow factor between a given layer and the nearest lower layer , the second `` 1 '' is that within the layer , and the last `` 1 '' is that between the layer and the nearest upper layer",
    ". generally we can define ( @xmath102 ) state for our system . for example",
    "( 131 ) state is possible for @xmath103 , and ( 212 ) state is also possible for the same @xmath23 .",
    "physically ( 212 ) state should be unstable because the inter - layer correlation becomes larger than the intra - layer one in this state . in the case of @xmath10 only the ( 111 )",
    "state is allowed within the subspace of halperin - type states .",
    "the third state is expected to be stable at @xmath104 when electrons transfer between layers .",
    "we call such a state the `` itinerant state '' and define it as follows . with the tunneling , bloch waves are formed along the @xmath31-direction .",
    "then the simplest candidate for the ground state is the one with the smallest kinetic ( tunneling ) energy .",
    "namely the cosine band in the @xmath31-direction is filled up to the fermi level  @xcite , with the filling of the landau level for each wave number being unity below the fermi level and zero above it .",
    "we can write it by use of electron creation operators as @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the fermi wave number given by @xmath107 .",
    "although we assume @xmath10 in this paper , the itinerant state can be defined for all @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "we use the vmc method to calculate the expectation value of the coulomb energy numerically for the multi - laughlin state and the ( 111 ) state .",
    "technical details are explained in appendix . in the case of the multi - laughlin state ,",
    "@xmath109 are reduced to the sum of the two - dimensional result simply because all layers are independent of each other , and the inter - layer coulomb energy is exactly canceled .",
    "we obtain @xmath110 on the other hand such cancellations do not occur for the ( 111 ) state , and the calculation becomes more complicated because of the inter - layer correlation .",
    "the energy is given by @xmath111    figure  [ graph1 ] shows the size dependence of the coulomb energy of the multi - laughlin state .",
    "the extrapolated value is in good agreement with that in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the coulomb energy for the ( 111 ) state on the inter - layer distance is shown in fig.[graph2 ] .",
    "the calculation was performed for three cases of finite size systems : @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 with @xmath115 .",
    "we find that the energy decreases with decreasing inter - layer distance .",
    "the dependence on @xmath16 is small in the region of small inter - layer distance .",
    "we calculate the energy of the itinerant state for the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian2 ] ) with use of the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "since we take the homogeneous trial state , the mean field is given by @xmath116 the mean field for the interaction part of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian2 ] ) consists of the direct and the exchange interactions .",
    "of these the energy due to the direct term is written as @xmath117 where we used the relation @xmath118 valid in the macroscopic limit .",
    "here we have @xmath119 and @xmath120 with @xmath121 integers .",
    "the direct term cancels exactly with the coulomb energy of the positive charge because of homogeneity of the itinerant state within each layer .",
    "therefore the hartree - fock hamiltonian is given by @xmath122 where the matrix element for the exchange mean - field is given by @xmath123.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the energy of the itinerant state is obtained as @xmath124.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the region of summation over @xmath125 in the above formula is shown in fig .  [ baaiwake ] . in order to derive the sum @xmath126",
    "we analyze the cases as follows : ( 1 ) @xmath127 for @xmath128 , ( 2 ) @xmath129 for @xmath130 , ( 3 ) @xmath131 for @xmath132 , and ( 4 ) @xmath127 for @xmath133 . as a result",
    "we summarize the four cases into a single expression given by @xmath134 therefore the energy per particle which contains the kinetic term is given in the thermodynamic limit by @xmath135              \\\\                                 & = &              \\alpha + \\varepsilon_{kin } + \\varepsilon_{int}^{hf}.              \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at this stage we let @xmath136 .",
    "it can be shown that the contribution of large @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) to the integration is negligible . to see this we observe that @xmath139 becomes @xmath140 and summation over @xmath141 converges in the limit of @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , @xmath142 becomes @xmath143 with use of the following formula : @xmath144 we can accomplish the summation over @xmath141 as @xmath145 consequently we obtain the following result : @xmath146 where @xmath147 denotes the inter - layer distance in units of the magnetic length .",
    "figure  [ graph3 ] shows @xmath142 as a function of the inter - layer distance .",
    "we remark that @xmath142 decreases with decreasing @xmath5 .",
    "this result originates from the fact that the inter - layer coulomb interaction becomes more effective as layers get closer .",
    "we first compare the coulomb energy per particle of the three states .",
    "figure  [ graph4 ] shows the results .",
    "the energy of the ( 111 ) state is obtained by the vmc calculation for 5 layers with 42 particles in each layer . for the multi - laughlin and",
    "the itinerant states the result is shown for the infinite - size system .",
    "we remark the energy of the multi - laughlin state does not depend on the inter - layer distance since all layers are independent of each other and electrons feel other layers neutral . in the region of @xmath148",
    "the coulomb energy of the multi - laughlin state is the lowest .",
    "this is evident because the system becomes a pile of almost independent two - dimensional layers in such a region . in the region of @xmath149 the ( 111 )",
    "state has the lowest coulomb energy .",
    "this result originates from the fact that the ( 111 ) state gains the inter - layer coulomb energy at the cost of the intra - layer one in the region where intra- and inter - layer interactions are comparable . with respect to the itinerant state , the coulomb energy decreases in the region of @xmath149 .",
    "there is however no region where it is the lowest .",
    "so far we have considered only the coulomb energy .",
    "we must take into account the tunneling energy of the itinerant state in order to compare the total energies of the three states .",
    "let us assume that the transfer energy @xmath150 depends on the inter - layer distance as @xmath151 where @xmath152 and @xmath153 are constants .",
    "then as shown in fig .",
    "[ graph5 ] we find a region of @xmath5 where the itinerant state has the lowest total energy . here",
    "we put appropriate values into @xmath152 and @xmath153 , namely @xmath154 for a case shown as @xmath155 , and @xmath156 for another case shown as @xmath157 . the parameters for @xmath157 with @xmath158",
    "are chosen to reproduce the band width of @xmath159 at @xmath160 which seems appropriate for a gaas / algaas superlattice @xcite .",
    "on the basis of the comparison we propose a phase diagram as shown in fig .",
    "[ graph6 ] for the ground state of the present system in the plane of @xmath150 and @xmath5 .",
    "if we assume the relation ( [ tofd ] ) between @xmath150 and @xmath5 in the diagram , possible states follow a curve in fig .",
    "[ graph6 ] as @xmath5 is varied . depending on the parameters @xmath152 and @xmath153",
    ", there are either single transition ( @xmath155 ) or double transitions ( @xmath157 ) . consequently the phase diagram fig .",
    "[ graph6 ] is interpreted as follows .    1 .   in the region @xmath161 ,",
    "the system is a pile of independent two - dimensional layers and the incompressible multi - laughlin state is stable .",
    "2 .   in the region of @xmath149 and",
    "the tunneling energy is small ( @xmath162 ) , the ( 111 ) state which is also incompressible is stabilized instead of the multi - laughlin state by the inter - layer correlation .",
    "when the tunneling energy is large , the compressible itinerant state is stabilized by competition of the tunneling energy and the coulomb energy .",
    "we compared the result of the ( 111 ) state for a finite size system and that of the multi - laughlin and the itinerant states for the infinite size system .",
    "the finite size ( @xmath16 and @xmath13 ) correction should be taken into account in the ( 111 ) state for more quantitative discussion . while we have no information with respect to the dependence on @xmath13 , the following remark is given from fig .",
    "[ graph2 ] about the dependence on @xmath16 .",
    "when one increases @xmath16 the coulomb energy much increases in the region of @xmath161 . while for @xmath8 the coulomb energy looks almost independent of @xmath16 within the error bars . since the boundaries of the ( 111 ) state occurs with @xmath163 in fig .",
    "[ graph6 ] , the finite - size correction should not change the results qualitatively .",
    "it should be possible to observe transitions in actual systems by adding a pressure to the system or tilting the magnetic field . since adding a pressure corresponds to control of @xmath5 , a change of parameters along a curve like @xmath155 or @xmath157 in the diagram fig .",
    "[ graph6 ] is expected . on the other hand tilting",
    "the magnetic field corresponds to control of @xmath150 independent of @xmath5 because the horizontal component of the magnetic field works on electrons to localize in the vertical direction and reduces @xmath150 .",
    "then the parameter change along a vertical straight line at a certain @xmath5 in fig .",
    "[ graph6 ] is expected .",
    "the transition between incompressible and compressible states is analogous to the mott transition in the hubbard model .",
    "namely the incompressible multi - laughlin and ( 111 ) states correspond to an insulator , while the compressible itinerant state corresponds to a metal .",
    "the transition between incompressible and compressible states occurs due to competition of the transfer ( tunneling ) and the on site ( intra - layer ) coulomb energy . in our model",
    "we estimate that the critical transfer energy is almost @xmath164 .",
    "although we discussed only three trial states for @xmath0 in the present study , we can not exclude the possibility of other states . in terms of two - dimensional incompressible states for @xmath0 ,",
    "it is difficult to construct states more stable than the multi - laughlin and the ( 111 ) states within the simple family of jastrow - type functions .",
    "one may however ask whether other states with three - body correlation or even more correlations are more favorable energetically . for three - dimensional compressible states ,",
    "the itinerant state is taken to be the simplest homogeneous state .",
    "then inhomogeneous states like cdw @xcite should also be discussed for more refined argument .",
    "furthermore we have neglected the spin degree of freedom which may be relevant to some systems .",
    "for example the sdw state , which accounts for the qhe of @xmath4 @xcite , can be a relevant state depending on parameters in the system .",
    "one of the authors ( s. s ) would like to thank h. yokoyama and s. tokizaki for instruction of the vmc method and useful discussion , and m. arikawa for pertinent suggestions .",
    "we describe the method of numerical calculation for the ( 111 ) state in this appendix .",
    "the expectation value of the coulomb energy for the ( 111 ) state is represented by @xmath165 we can obtain the numerical value of @xmath166 for finite size ( finite particles ) systems by the vmc method . in evaluating the second term with minimum statistical errors , we separate the variables in it and reduce the expectation value of the quantity between two bodies to that of one body . for this purpose",
    "we introduce the fourier transform of the coulomb potential @xmath167 , one body distribution function @xmath168 , and its fourier transform @xmath169 as follows : @xmath170 @xmath171,\\ ] ] @xmath172 @xmath173 where we wrote @xmath174 as @xmath175",
    ". then the second term @xmath176 in ( [ 11hcoulomb ] ) is arranged into @xmath177 we use this formula to obtain the numerical value of @xmath176 .",
    "figure  [ gq13 ] shows an example of numerical results .",
    "the integral with respect to @xmath178 is performed by the trapezoidal rule because only discrete values of @xmath179 are obtained by the vmc calculation .",
    "we cut off the upper region in the integral at a finite value @xmath180 because the integrand converges to zero near @xmath181 and its contribution to the integral is negligible in the region @xmath182 .",
