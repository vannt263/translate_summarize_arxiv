    "phenomenological macroscopic electrodynamics is based on the well known experimental observations that an external electric field can induce a polarization of a medium , whereas an external magnetic field can induce a magnetization of matter . as a result , the electric and magnetic excitations @xmath0 ( comprising a 2-form @xmath1 ) are functions of the electric and magnetic field strengths @xmath2 ( collected in a 2-form @xmath3 ) and of the permittivity @xmath4 and the permeability @xmath5 of the medium . in the simplest case of an isotropic medium at rest ,",
    "the constitutive relations read @xmath6 and @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are the electric and magnetic constants ( permittivity and permeability of the vacuum ) . however , in the 1960s it was theoretically predicted @xcite and experimentally confirmed @xcite that certain media become electrically polarized when placed into a magnetic field or are magnetized when put into an electric field . since then , such a magnetoelectric effect was observed for many substances and studied in great detail both theoretically and experimentally , see for the reviews @xcite , for example .",
    "the constitutive relation of a medium at rest is then modified to @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where the traceless @xmath12 matrix @xmath13 describes the magnetoelectric properties ( @xmath14 denotes the transposed matrix ) .",
    "the magnetoelectric effect can be observed in a certain class of media , but it also can be induced in media which are put into external electric and magnetic fields .",
    "recently , attention to magnetoelectric media was attracted in connection with an interesting new effect predicted by feigel @xcite .",
    "he noticed that the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a magnetoelectric medium is essentially asymmetric in the sense that the waves moving in opposite directions carry different momenta .",
    "then , calculating the total momentum of the virtual waves ( or  vacuum fluctuations \" of the electromagnetic field ) which are present in the sample , he concluded that this quantity is nontrivial . in this sense , the feigel effect predicts the extraction of momentum from vacuum .",
    "this possibility was discussed in @xcite . in particular , in @xcite a certain similarity of the feigel effect with the casimir effect was noticed , and the computation of the total momentum transfered by the virtual waves was attacked by means of the green s function method . in this paper , we analyse the feigel effect in a sample of _ finite _ size which was somehow neglected in the previous works .",
    "it seems clear that the discussion of the feigel effect is related to the definition of the energy and momentum of the electromagnetic field in a medium , and moreover , in a moving medium ( since a nontrivial velocity of a sample is predicted @xcite ) .",
    "however , as it is well known , the issue of the energy and the momentum of the electromagnetic field ( and of waves , in particular ) in dielectric and magnetic media has a long and controversial history .",
    "the discussion of this issue began with the investigations of minkowski @xcite , abraham @xcite , and einstein and laub @xcite .",
    "the problem is reviewed in @xcite , and most recently , in @xcite .",
    "however , till now the problem was not settled neither theoretically , nor experimentally ( see a discussion in @xcite , e.g. ) . in the recent paper @xcite we have proposed a consistent definition of the electromagnetic energy - momentum in media , and furthermore , a variational approach was developed in @xcite for the moving magnetoelectric medium specifically for the study of the feigel effect .",
    "an interesting technical observation is then that the magnetoelectric matrix @xmath13 induces a term in the energy - momentum tensor which describes an additional flux of energy and momentum .",
    "such an additional term is present even in the medium at rest , and it vanishes when the magnetoelectric properties are absent .",
    "this fact lends some support to the feasibility of the feigel effect , at least on a qualitative level .    here , however , we will analyse the possibility of the feigel effect avoiding the problem of the electromagnetic energy - momentum in the medium .",
    "the crucial point is the assumption of a finite size of the magnetoelectric sample .",
    "then we notice that the virtual waves , which are excited in the medium , are not confined to the sample .",
    "since the boundaries are not impenetrable , the vacuum fluctuations exist everywhere , inside the medium as well as outside of it .",
    "since the virtual electromagnetic waves in these regions of space are related by the jump conditions across the boundaries , we can eventually replace the evaluation of the electromagnetic momentum and forces inside the medium by the computation of these quantities in free space . in vacuum the energy - momentum is uniquely defined , and this simplifies the analysis of the possible feigel effect to a considerable extent .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",

    "we take care of the irreducible decomposition and evaluate the matrix elements of ( [ cr ] ) : @xmath47 we have @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "thus we have the independent components of @xmath51 ( 6 ) , @xmath52 ( 6 ) , @xmath53 ( 8) , @xmath54 ( 3 ) , @xmath55 ( 3 ) , @xmath56 ( 9 ) , and @xmath46 ( 1 ) .",

    "throughout the paper we will use the exterior calculus which proves to be very effective and convenient both in describing the general formalism and in the specific computations . here",
    "we put the constitutive relation for the magnetoelectric media into a simple and transparent form by using the language of exterior calculus .",

    "the spatial metric is euclidean , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",

    "obviously , @xmath79 . finally , the first irreducible part is trace- and pseudotrace - free , i.e. , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the first term in ( [ betadec ] ) describes the tracefree symmetric part of the matrix @xmath53 , whereas the second term is its antisymmetric part . when the first irreducible piece vanishes , the constitutive relation ( [ constm1])-([constm2 ] ) becomes much simpler : @xmath82    in this paper , we will mainly analyse the general case ( [ constm1])-([constm2 ] ) , with special attention to the medium studied by feigel .",

    "furthermore , our observations demonstrate the difference between the two irreducible parts of the magnetoelectric matrix @xmath53 .",
    "namely , assuming that only first ( symmetric ) irreducible part is nontrivial , we have @xmath156 , and then the waves of the different polarization contribute to the above formulas with terms of the opposite sign since then @xmath157 .",
    "the natural assumption that the virtual waves of any polarization are produced with equal probability then leads to the conclusion that the net result will be zero due to the mutual compensation of the contributions of the waves of different polarizations . in other words , we find that the first irreducible part of the magnetoelectric matrix is irrelevant for the possible feigel effect . however , for the second ( antisymmetric ) part the situation is different .",
    "then @xmath158 , and the waves of both polarizations now contribute with terms of the same sign .",
    "this was also observed in the original computation @xcite with the result obtained there which is proportional to the skew - symmetric combination @xmath159 .",
    "this shows that the only the second ( antisymmetric or pseudotrace ) irreducible part of the magnetoelectric matrix ( i.e. , the 1-form @xmath85 ) is responsible for the possible feigel effect .    finally , we can make some _ predictions _ going beyond the scheme of the virtual waves of the original feigel picture",
    "let us assume that _ real _ electromagnetic waves are directed on the magnetoelectric sample from the two sides .",
    "this can be easily achieved if we split the initial beam into the two beams which are then , with a simple system of mirrors , directed on the two opposite sides of the magnetoelectric sample .",
    "then we are exactly in the situation describe as the case ( iii ) above .",
    "the outcome which we derived in this case is that the sample will be affected by a nontrivial force ( [ force ] ) from the electromagnetic fields falling on it .",
    "the sign and the magnitude of this force is determined by the polarization of the infalling waves and by the magnetoelectric parameters @xmath160 of the medium .",
    "this effect can be directly verified experimentally .",
    "moreover , one can use this real feigel effect for the measurement of the magnetoelectric parameters @xmath161 .",
    "this method is drastically different and much simpler in its practical realization than the usual measurements of the magnetoelectric parameters from the observation of magnetization of a medium in an external electric field ( resp . , electric polarization of a medium in an external magnetic field ) .",
    "in this paper we analysed the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a magnetoelectric medium .",
    "our aim was to use this analysis for the discussion of the possibility of the feigel effect @xcite that was predicted recently .",
    "we derived a natural decomposition of the magnetoelectric matrix @xmath53 into the two irreducible parts : the first ( tracefree symmetric ) , and the second ( antisymmetric , or pseudotrace ) .",
    "the magnetoelectric matrix is tracefree .",
    "however , the axion also describes the magnetoelectric effect , see ( [ explicit ] ) and ( [ explicit2 ] ) .",
    "being a 4d pseudoscalar , the axion can be formally treated as a trace of generalized magnetoelectric @xmath12 matrix .",
    "we discussed the physical properties of the axion piece elsewhere @xcite and here we assume ( like in @xcite and in the previous work @xcite ) that the axion piece is absent . ultimately we find that only the second part ( i.e. , the magnetoelectric pseudotrace or antisymmetric part ) can be responsible for the possible feigel effect . physically",
    "this result appears to be quite natural because the magnetoelectric pseudotrace 1-form @xmath85 selects a distinguished direction in space . along this direction , we then subsequently find the nontrivial forces and electromagnetic momenta acting on the magnetoelectric medium .    we show that taking into account the finite size of a magnetoelectric sample , one can reduce the problem of computation of the electromagnetic energy , the momentum and the forces to the vacuum regions just outside the sample .",
    "we then demonstrate that the net force on the sample turns out to be zero for the careful count of the contributions from all the the virtual electromagnetic waves excited in the medium .    at the same time",
    ", we discover that for _ real _ electromagnetic waves , that fall along the direction of the pseudotrace @xmath85 on a sample from the two opposite sides , is nontrivial .",
    "accordingly , it would make the magnetoelectric sample move along @xmath85 , indeed , as was predicted in the original work @xcite .",
    "we propose to use this observation for the measurement of the magnetoelectric susceptibilities .",
    "such an method could provide a useful alternative scheme for the measurements of the magnetoelectric parameters , along with the traditional methods based on the measurements of polarization induced in an external magnetic field ( or of magnetization induced by an external electric field ) .    in the current paper ,",
    "we have confined our attention ( like also feigel in @xcite ) to the waves induced along @xmath85 .",
    "strictly speaking , the complete analysis requires also to take into account the waves that move along other directions .",
    "the extension of the above results to such waves is straightforward , although the formulas ( especially those that relate the waves in the media and in vacuum at the boundary surfaces ) turn out to be appreciable longer .",
    "the corresponding analysis , however , shows that the main contribution to the possible feigel effect comes from the waves moving along @xmath85 , so the additional modes do not change the conclusions qualitatively .",
