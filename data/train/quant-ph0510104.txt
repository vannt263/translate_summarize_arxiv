    "<S> we present a simple information - disturbance tradeoff relation valid for any general measurement apparatus : the disturbance between input and output states is lower bounded by the information the apparatus provides in distinguishing these two states .    </S>",
    "<S> eprint : quant - ph/0510104    extraction of information from a quantum system can not always be without feedback . </S>",
    "<S> this was clear since the early days of quantum mechanics : it was the spirit of the original form of the heisenberg uncertainty `` principle '' , as derived from the gedanken - experiment of the heisenberg microscope  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since then , much more refined descriptions of allowed quantum measurements have been put forth  @xcite , so that we now know that the heisenberg principle can be easily circumvented  @xcite , and that its correct interpretation must be carefully adjusted ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a recent review on the subject ) . </S>",
    "<S> the upshot is that there is no `` unavoidable dynamical disturbance '' attached to all measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the debate on the uncertainty is no longer confined to the realm of theory  @xcite , but experiments have also been carried out  @xcite confirming that a feedback on the state of the system ( due to information extraction ) is present even when all the possible dynamical disturbances have been carefully eliminated . in a sense , this is to be expected since the state of a system does not have a physical reality _ </S>",
    "<S> per se _ , but it is a conceptual construct expressing the information the experimenter has on the system  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> what is most astonishing , is that such `` informational feedback '' can have dynamical consequences : the subsequent evolution may drastically change depending on the information extracted .    </S>",
    "<S> is this feedback always present ? </S>",
    "<S> if the initial state of the system is known , then a measurement which extracts any kind of information without changing the system state  @xcite is always possible  . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it would seem that no information - disturbance tradeoff relation can exist . in this paper , however , we show that any informative measurement will affect at least one state of the system . </S>",
    "<S> an information - disturbance tradeoff concerning such a state can then be conceived : the amount of disturbance on that state is lower bounded by the amount of information that the measurement would return in distinguishing such input from its corresponding output , see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ infodist ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> various different information - disturbance tradeoffs have been proposed previously  @xcite , which explore different measures of information and of disturbance . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we use the most intuitive notions for these quantities : information is measured in bits through mutual information and disturbance is measured using fidelity , which is the natural distance measure for quantum states  @xcite .    in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we start by introducing the notation . </S>",
    "<S> we show that at least one state must be modified by the measurement and then we give a bound on such modification . for the sake of clarity , </S>",
    "<S> we give proofs of a very simple case , and postpone the general derivation to the appendix .    before attempting a derivation of an information - disturbance tradeoff </S>",
    "<S> , we have to appropriately define these two quantities .    </S>",
    "<S> _ information : _ intuitively , one would expect that the information extracted from a measurement should be defined as a function of the outcome statistics only , such as the entropy of the probability of the outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> this is easily shown to be inadequate : think of a measurement device that returns random outcomes ( according to a well defined probability ) without yielding any information on the system . </S>",
    "<S> a `` good '' measurement should have outcomes in some way correlated to the initial state of the system , so to provide information on the system . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a suitable expression for the information - part of our tradeoff is through the mutual information @xmath0 the measurement provides on which of two equally - probable input states the system is in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it supplies the fraction of a bit the measurement tells us on which one is the input state , and varies continuously between @xmath1 ( no knowledge ) and @xmath2 ( complete knowledge ) . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , we can employ the binary entropy @xmath3 of the probability @xmath4 of making an error when determining which state : it is a measure of the uncertainty on the determination of which state . </S>",
    "<S> the two quantities are simply related as @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> information is measured in bits . to obtain an adimensional quantity ( in order to relate information and disturbance ) , we will consider the ratio between information @xmath0 ( or uncertainty @xmath6 ) and the maximum information ( or maximum uncertainty ) that can be obtained , i.e. one bit in this case .    _ disturbance : _ a system is disturbed by a physical process when its initial and final states do not coincide . </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity @xmath7tr@xmath8 ^ 2 $ ]  @xcite , a simple function of the bures distance , is the most appropriate measure of the `` distance '' between the two states @xmath9 and @xmath10 . as such </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath11 can be taken as a measurement of the disturbance  @xcite : @xmath12 if there is no disturbance ( the output state @xmath10 coincides with the input @xmath9 ) and @xmath13 if the input has been modified . with this choice , a unitary evolution counts as a disturbing process , even though it can be easily undone . </S>",
    "<S> this might seem unfortunate  @xcite , but a unitary evolution can not provide any information on the state , so its effect does not contrast the information - disturbance tradeoff ( according to which a disturbance without information gain is possible ) .    before deriving the tradeoff , we quickly review the necessary concepts regarding quantum measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the postulates of quantum mechanics  @xcite assert that the outcomes statistics of any measurement is described by a povm ( positive operator - valued measure ) , a set of positive operators @xmath14 acting on the system hilbert space @xmath15 such that @xmath16 ( @xmath17 being the identity on @xmath15 ) : the probability of the @xmath18th measurement outcome is @xmath19tr@xmath20 $ ] , where @xmath9 is the state of the system prior to the measurement ( born rule ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the @xmath18th measurement outcome occurred , the state evolves according to the following state - reduction rule  @xcite @xmath21 where the operators @xmath22 and the set of indices @xmath23 are such that @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that both the sets @xmath22 and @xmath25 ( with arbitrary unitary operators @xmath26 ) give rise to the same povm @xmath14 and thus to the same outcome statistics : the post - measurement state is in general _ not _ determined by the povm elements . </S>",
    "<S> this is the reason why it is impossible to obtain an information - disturbance tradeoff relation which is independent on the system state . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , if we know the input state @xmath9 , we can always tune the operators @xmath26 to reobtain the same state at the output ( if @xmath9 is a mixed state , some additional classical randomness might also be necessary ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we can measure the value of a qubit in the computational basis ( using the povm @xmath27 ) and always get as output state @xmath28 , by choosing @xmath29 and @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> a striking example of the same sort is a measurement of position which leaves a particle in an eigenstate of the momentum  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the physical interpretation of the operators @xmath26 is clarified by considering a simple stern - gerlach measurement . </S>",
    "<S> no sane experimentalist who possesses a stern - gerlach apparatus oriented in the @xmath31 direction rotates all his laboratory if he needs to measure a @xmath32-spin along the @xmath33 axis . </S>",
    "<S> he applies a unitary transformation to rotate the spin with a magnetic field  @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the post - measurement state ( if the spin is not absorbed ) is an eigenstate of @xmath34 , even though @xmath35 was measured .    </S>",
    "<S> = .75    any evolution of the type  ( [ statered ] ) can be derived from a unitary evolution through the so - called indirect measurement model  @xcite ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> f : imm ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the measured system interacts unitarily with an external ancillary system describing the measurement apparatus . </S>",
    "<S> the ancillary system then undergoes a lders - type projective measurement @xmath36 , i.e. such that its povm elements are orthogonal projectors @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the system output state is then the partial trace ( over the ancillary hilbert space @xmath38 ) conditioned on obtaining the result @xmath18 on the ancilla , i.e.  @xcite @xmath39}{\\mbox{tr } \\left[(\\openone_{\\cal h}\\otimes|k\\rangle\\langle    k|)\\:u\\:(\\varrho\\otimes\\sigma)\\:u^\\dag \\right ] } \\;\\labell{ozicollapse},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the initial state of the ancilla and @xmath41 is the unitary interaction that correlates the system to the apparatus , acting on @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that there is no assumption on the joint post - measurement state in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ozicollapse ] ) , which combines the born rule on the ancillary space @xmath38 with the rule to obtain the state of a subsystem from a partial trace on the joint state .    for the sake of clarity </S>",
    "<S> , we will start analyzing the simple case in which the input states of the system @xmath9 and of the apparatus @xmath43 are pure and no entanglement is generated by the unitary @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the general situation will be analyzed subsequently . </S>",
    "<S> the unitary will thus evolve two different input states @xmath44 and @xmath45 according to the evolution @xmath46 and @xmath47 . a unitary does not change the scalar product , hence @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the measurement is informative , i.e. the apparatus is able to correlate to the system somehow . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that there must exist some @xmath44 and @xmath45 that give rise to different states in the apparatus , i.e. @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath50 so that @xmath51 , i.e. the output states are less distinguishable than the input : their fidelity has increased . in the general case </S>",
    "<S> ( see the appendix ) , this can be formalized in the following way . for any informative measurement , there exist at least two system states @xmath52 and @xmath53 such that @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 are the output states corresponding to @xmath52 , @xmath53 when the measurement results are the same . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that for any measurement there exists at least one state that is modified .    </S>",
    "<S> call such a state @xmath57 . the scalar product between @xmath57 and its evolved counterpart @xmath58 is @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the apparatus states corresponding to system inputs @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively , and where @xmath62 is the system output corresponding to input @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> [ in general the evolution @xmath41 will generate entanglement between system and apparatus so that the system output state will be a mixed state ( see appendix ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of error @xmath4 in discriminating between two states @xmath60 and @xmath61 can be calculated from state discrimination theory  @xcite as @xmath63 , whence @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty in this discrimination is given by the shannon entropy of the related probability distribution @xmath65 , i.e. the binary entropy @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> it measures the bits of information one would gain by discovering which of the two states the apparatus is in after the unitary interaction . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath67 , we find that @xmath68 : the fidelity between the input and output states is upper bounded by the binary entropy related to the discrimination of the two states by the apparatus . </S>",
    "<S> this can be restated in the form of a tradeoff relation as @xmath69 in the general situation ( see the appendix ) , this information - disturbance tradeoff takes the equivalent form @xmath70 the disturbance @xmath11 between input @xmath9 and output @xmath10 is lower bounded by the mutual information @xmath71 on which of the two states @xmath9 and @xmath10 is present at the input . </S>",
    "<S> this is the main result of the paper . by rearranging the terms of  ( [ infodist ] ) as @xmath72 </S>",
    "<S> , we can also give it a different interpretation : the disturbance @xmath11 between input and output plus the uncertainty @xmath3 in the discrimination by the apparatus of these two states can not be made arbitrarily small . </S>",
    "<S> equivalently , we can say that the mutual information on which state plus the fidelity of these two states are upper bounded by one .    </S>",
    "<S> since the inequality @xmath67 is tight only for @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , the bound  ( [ infodist ] ) is not tight in general . </S>",
    "<S> it is achieved only if the apparatus can not discriminate between @xmath9 and @xmath10 at all , or if it can discriminate between them exactly .    even though the state reduction rule is not a quantum prerogative , </S>",
    "<S> the tradeoff we derived is a purely quantum effect . in classical mechanics , </S>",
    "<S> an informative non - disturbing measurement which perfectly correlates the outcomes with the state of a system will collapse a mixed state into a pure state : the effect of such a measurement is to reduce the `` volume '' that the state of the system occupies in phase space ( a sort of `` classical state - reduction '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> in classical mechanics there is no lower bound to such volume and two pure states , which occupy zero volume , can always be distinguished without disturbance . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in quantum mechanics the `` volume '' a state must occupy in phase space is lower bounded by @xmath76 . on one hand </S>",
    "<S> two non - identical pure states may overlap and their conclusive discrimination may not be possible . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , if the post - measurement state is perfectly correlated with the outcome ( lders or von neumann type apparatuses ) and the measure is sharp enough to sufficiently constrain the volume in one direction of the phase space , the post - measurement state must `` expand '' in other directions to preserve the minimum volume . for other types of apparatuses </S>",
    "<S> the situation is not as clear - cut , but as we have shown , at least one pure state of the system must be modified by any informative measurement . </S>",
    "<S> so , while in classical mechanics the system will evolve compatibly with its pre - measurement trajectory in phase space ( only the `` thickness '' of the trajectory may be reduced ) , in quantum mechanics the phase - space expansion might have observable consequences and the system might not evolve compatibly with its pre - measurement trajectory .    in conclusion , we have derived an information - disturbance tradeoff which is valid for any measurement device : any measurement modifies at least one state of the system , and the fidelity between input and output states is upper bounded by the information the apparatus is able to extract when discriminating between input and output . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of conservation of quantum information  @xcite was inspirational : one can interpret the measurement as a correlation between the initial state of the system and the measurement apparatus . </S>"
