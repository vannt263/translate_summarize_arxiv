    "the most reliable method to model the evolution of dense star clusters is the direct integration of the equations of motions of all stars via  calculations .",
    "the high cost of such calculations , however , limits the choice of the number of stars to a few ten thousands , a small number compared to real globular clusters , and also limits the number of calculations which can be performed on a practical time scale .    in the last few decades fokker - planck models",
    "have gained in popularity for studying the dynamics of globular clusters ( see meylan & heggie 1997 for a recent review ) .",
    "the relatively low computational cost of fokker - planck models makes it possible to perform a large number of calculations over broad ranges of initial parameters .",
    "this open the possibility to study the initial parameter space which may have been available at the formation of the population of observed globular clusters .",
    "on the other hand , one has to pay for the higher speed of  calculations with a less accuracy of these models .",
    "it is therefore important to examine the accuracy of  models .",
    "one way of such examinations is to do a comparative study between and calculations .",
    "the development of approximate methods for modeling the dynamical evolution of star clusters started in the 1970 s using monte - carlo methods ( spitzer 1987 , and references therein ) .",
    "several groups applied these methods to address various problems in stellar dynamics .",
    "cohn ( 1979 , 1980 ) developed a new method in which the orbit - averaged equation was solved directly using a finite - difference technique .",
    "cohn ( 1980 ) demonstrated that his code could follow the evolution of the cluster into much more advanced stages of core collapse than monte - carlo codes ( see , however , giersz 1998 , for a possible revival of monte - carlo methods ) .    in cohn s calculations",
    "globular clusters were modeled as fairly idealized systems , i.e. : isolated systems of identical point masses ( cohn 1979 , 1980 ) .",
    "this is quite a natural starting point for theoretical studies . after cohn s seminal works , many contributions have been made to improve cohn s  scheme in terms of adding various astrophysical processes , such as a mass spectrum , primordial binaries , a tidal cut - off , gravitational shocks by the galactic disk and bulge , mass loss from stellar evolution , anisotropy of the velocity distribution , rotation of the clusters , etc .",
    "( see meylan & heggie 1997 ) .",
    "an important landmark in modeling the evolution of globular clusters with  calculations was set by chernoff & weinberg ( 1990 , hereafter cw ) .",
    "their models included a tidal cut - off by the parent galaxy , a stellar mass spectrum , and mass loss due to stellar evolution .",
    "cw boldly added simultaneously several new astrophysical phenomena to their models .",
    "however , generally speaking , each time a model is extended trying to make simulations more `` realistic '' , the number of assumptions usually increases ; therefore thorough testing is required ( not only for  models ) to eliminate the possible introduction of omissions and the violation of previously - made assumptions .",
    "it is not easy to assess the reliability of a model .",
    "the most reliable way to do this may well be detailed comparison with another model which is based on a completely different numerical method .",
    "such comparisons have found good agreement between , , and gaseous models for isolated star clusters of point masses ( giersz and heggie 1994a , 1994b ; giersz and spurzem 1994 ; spurzem and takahashi 1995 ) .",
    "these are important results because they demonstrate that two - body relaxation is a main physical process which drives the dynamical evolution of star clusters , as was expected from theory ( see , e.g. , spitzer 1987 ) , and therefore that the time evolution of such relatively simple systems scales with the two - body relaxation time .",
    "fukushige & heggie ( 1995 ) and portegies zwart et al .",
    "( 1998 ) demonstrated that  calculations give significantly different results from the isotropic  calculations of cw for some initial conditions . these  and  calculations included the steady tidal field of the parent galaxy and mass loss due to the evolution of single stars .",
    "the results of portegies zwart et al .",
    "( 1998 ) can be summarized as follows : 1 ) the clusters simulated with the @xmath0-body model live more than an order of magnitude longer than the comparable isotropic model ; 2 ) the lifetime of the clusters depends on the number of stars @xmath0 in a rather complex way .",
    "the clusters with a larger number of stars live shorter contrary to what was expected ) .",
    "a similar @xmath0-dependence of  models was also found in a collaborative experiment organized by heggie ( heggie et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "takahashi & portegies zwart ( 1998 , tpz hereafter ) solved the discrepancies pointed out by portegies zwart et al .",
    "( 1998 ) by using more general _ anisotropic _  models together with an improved treatment of the tidal boundary .",
    "the improved  models are in in excellent agreement with  models .",
    "the assumption of velocity isotropy and the oversimplified escape condition adopted by cw turned out to result in an enormous overestimate of the escape rate , i.e. : an underestimate of the life time of the cluster .",
    "tpz took account of the orbital angular momentum as well as the orbital energy to determine escaping stars .",
    "tpz also took account of that a star on an escape orbit requires some time to leave the cluster .",
    "the number of stars that escape per relaxation time depends therefore on the ratio of the relaxation time to the dynamical time , i.e. : on the number of stars .",
    "tpz s implementation of the escape condition adds a free parameter  ( denoted by @xmath1 in tpz ) to models .",
    "this parameter determines the time scale on which escaping stars leave the cluster , and should be of the order of the crossing time at the tidal radius ( lee & ostriker 1987 ; see also ross et al .",
    "tpz compared calculations with calculations to calibrated  for one specific set of initial conditions : density profile , mass function and relaxation time .",

    "this hypothesis is the first main purpose of this paper .",
    "the second purpose of this paper is to carry out an extensive survey of the evolution of globular clusters in the galaxy for various initial conditions .",

    "we use anisotropic orbit - averaged fokker - planck models ( cohn 1979 ; takahashi 1995 ) .",
    "the star cluster is assumed to be spherically symmetric and in dynamical equilibrium at any time .",
    "the distribution function @xmath2 at time @xmath3 is then a function of the energy of a star per unit mass , @xmath4 , and the angular momentum per unit mass , @xmath5 ( see e.g. , spitzer 1987 , section 1.2 ) . on the other hand , isotropic models ( cohn 1980 ) assume that the distribution function does not depend on the angular momentum , i.e. , that the velocity distribution is isotropic at every point in the cluster",
    ".    anisotropic  models are more general than isotropic  models and therefore preferable . the higher computational costs and more complex numerical implementation , however , caused anisotropic  models to be less favored than their isotropic cousins ( cohn 1980 ) .",
    "the numerical problem which was encountered by cohn ( 1979 ) in his anisotropic  calculations was solved by takahashi ( 1995 ; 1996 ) mainly by implementing a new finite - difference scheme ( see also drukier et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "all  calculations in this paper are performed with the code which was developed by takahashi ( 1995 ; 1996 ) and was later modified to include a mass function for single stars ( takahashi 1997 ) , a tidal boundary ( takahashi et al .",
    "1997 ; tpz ) , and stellar evolution ( tpz ) .",
    "tpz demonstrated that the results of  calculations are sensitive to the choice of the tidal boundary conditions .",
    "two different criteria for the identification of escapers were tested by takahashi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and by tpz .",
    "these are : 1 ) the apocenter criterion , in which a star is removed if @xmath6 and 2 ) the energy criterion , in which a star is removed if @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the tidal radius of the cluster , @xmath9 is the apocenter distance of a star with energy @xmath4 and angular momentum @xmath5 , @xmath10 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath11 is the cluster mass .    the apocenter criterion is considered more realistic than the energy criterion .",
    "the latter tends to remove too many stars too quickly , since it may even remove stars orbiting inside the tidal radius . for most calculations we adopt the * a*pocenter criterion to determine escapers for * a*nisotropic  models",
    "; we call these models aa  models",
    ". we also adopt the * e*nergy criterion for some calculations , these models are called ae  models .      in the  calculations performed by cw ,",
    "escapers are removed instantaneously from the clusters . in the absence of stellar evolution",
    "this condition may be justified if the dynamical time scale of the cluster is negligible compared to the two - body relaxation time , i.e. ; if the number of stars @xmath12 .",
    "tpz demonstrated that the lifetime of stellar systems with small @xmath0 is dramatically affected by the time scale on which escaping stars are removed from the cluster .",
    "two treatments of escaping stars were tested by tpz : 1 ) instantaneous escape : a star is removed from the cluster as soon as it satisfies an adopted escape criterion ; 2 ) crossing - time escape : a star on an escape orbit hangs around in the cluster for a certain time before it really leaves the cluster .    to implement the crossing - time escape condition in calculations we use the boundary condition of lee & ostriker ( 1987 ) : @xmath13^{1/2 }                          \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt {                         \\frac{4\\pi}{3}g\\rho_{\\rm t}}. \\label{eq : lo}\\ ] ] here",
    "@xmath14 is the mean mass density within the tidal radius and  is a dimensionless constant which determines the time scale on which escapers leave the cluster .",
    "this equation is applied in a region of phase space where the adopted escape criterion is satisfied .",
    "( [ eq : lo ] ) is derived assuming that escapers leave the cluster on a dynamical time scale .",
    "for @xmath15 with a fixed relaxation time , this condition becomes identical to removing escapers instantaneously , since the ratio of the crossing time to the relaxation time vanishes .    when eq .",

    "the mass function is independent of the distance to the cluster center .",

    "cw s definition , however , is not free from ambiguity particularly for the mass at disruption , since the above - mentioned mass - loss acceleration is related to the breaking of numerical calculations .    for clusters that dissolve we continued the calculations until the mass evolution curves start to bend downwards very rapidly ( see figure  [ fig : surm - a ] ) .",
    "we define @xmath92 as the moment when the mass loss rate becomes virtually infinite . then , however , the mass at @xmath92 is not well defined .",
    "therefore , for convenience , we decided to take @xmath93 as the disruption time , and then @xmath94 .",

    "the circles plotted at the ends of some of the lines indicate the moments when those clusters experience core collapse .",
    "the destiny of the clusters is determined by the initial conditions ( @xmath42 , @xmath47 , and @xmath58 ) .",
    "the early evolution is strongly affected by the choice of @xmath42 and @xmath47 , and in less extent by the initial relaxation time , simply because the latter requires more time to affect the dynamics of the stellar system .",
    "the lifetimes of the clusters which are disrupted within @xmath96gyr , for example , are almost independent of the initial relaxation time .",
    "the evolution of these clusters is mainly driven by stellar mass loss .",
    "this causes the clusters to expand after which the galaxy gobbles up the clusters .",
    "core collapse occurs only in some long - lived ( @xmath97  gyr ) clusters . for these clusters",
    "the mass loss rate gradually decreases with time ( see also portegies zwart et al .",
    "1998 ) .    figure [ fig : surc - a ] shows the evolution of the concentration parameter @xmath98 , which we define by ( cf .",
    "king 1966 ) @xmath99 here the core radius @xmath100 is @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the central density and @xmath103 is the density - weighted velocity dispersion in the cluster center .",
    "note that this core radius @xmath100 and the king core radius ( king 1966 ) are not identical even for single - mass systems , since the central velocity dispersion is not used in the definition of the king radius .",
    "the two quantities get closer for more concentrated ( higher @xmath42 ) clusters ( cf .",
    "binney & tremaine 1987 , p.  235 ) .    in some cases ( for @xmath86 , @xmath104 of all the families , and for @xmath105 , @xmath106 of family 1 ) the cluster experiences core collapse after almost all ( @xmath107% ) of the initial mass is lost .",
    "we identify these clusters as collapsing clusters , because the concentration @xmath98 rapidly increases at the final epochs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : surc - a ] ) .",
    "if the initial mass of a cluster is relatively small ( e.g. @xmath108 ) , the definite evidence of core collapse will be very hard to observe , since the number of stars in the core will become too small ( e.g. @xmath109 ) .",
    "deep core collapse in such systems can easily be prevented by the formation of binaries by three - body processes or by burning primordial binaries .",
    "such processes are more effective in small @xmath0 clusters .    for @xmath86 , @xmath104 ,",
    "irrespective of the families , the clusters have very small masses ( compared to their initial masses ) around @xmath11010  gyr .",
    "this implies that they may be observed at present as tiny globular clusters or as old open clusters ( see   [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "for all the models with @xmath104 , mass loss due to stellar evolution causes the concentration to decrease with time before core collapse occurs . for @xmath442.5 and 3.5",
    ", the concentration does not decrease so much but stays almost constant . if , at any time , the concentration becomes smaller than @xmath111 ( compare with @xmath112 for the @xmath113 king model ) , the cluster quickly dissolves . as cw pointed out",
    "( see their section viic ) , the ( scaled ) density profiles just before disruption are always similar regardless of initial models .",
    "all our clusters of model aa live longer than those of cw for the same initial conditions .",
    "the largest ( relative ) discrepancy is about a factor of ten which is found for @xmath114 and @xmath115 . for the models with @xmath116 and @xmath117 ,",
    "the discrepancy is about a factor of two . in the latter models the mass functions are very flat and the potentials are shallow , and thus stellar mass loss alone is enough to disrupt these clusters .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that even the aa  models can not live so long compared with the cw models .",
    "the disruption time hardly depends on the initial relaxation time for those clusters which disrupt within @xmath118% of the half - mass relaxation time .",
    "table [ tab : sur - f1 ] compares our ae  and aa  models with cw s models for family 1 .",
    "in addition to the data already given in table [ tab : sur ] , @xmath90 and @xmath89 , two new quantities , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , are presented . here",
    "@xmath121 and @xmath122 denote the final mass and time , respectively , of each of cw s models which are given in table [ tab : sur ] .",
    "these two quantities are particularly useful for comparing different models for disrupted clusters .    the energy criterion for the tidal boundary is used for the cw models as well as for the ae  models .",
    "the aemodels are in this sense in between the cw and aa  models .",
    "comparison with the ae  models helps us to understand how the apocenter criterion affects the results .",
    "the ae  models lose mass faster than the aamodels in all the cases shown in table [ tab : sur - f1 ] , simply because the energy criterion introduces a larger escape region in phase space than the apocenter criterion ( takahashi et al .",
    "1997 ; tpz ) .",
    "the difference between the cw and ae  models is rather small in all cases . for each set of initial conditions",
    "the two models have the same destiny , disruption or collapse .",
    "the difference in the disruption time is within a factor of two , and that in @xmath123 is even smaller .",
    "we therefore conclude that the introduction of the apocenter criterion plays the most important role in extending the cluster lifetime .    for @xmath114 and @xmath115",
    "we find large differences between the cw and aa  models not only in @xmath90 and @xmath89 but also in @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "this assures that the discrepancy between the two models are not merely due to differences in the definitions of the disruption time and mass .",
    "the clusters survive beyond the disruption times given by cw , which is also supported by  simulations ( tpz ; ",
    "[ sec : fpvsnb ] ) .",
    "about half ( seventeen ) of the clusters calculated with aa  models experience core collapse , while in the calculations of cw less than 30% ( ten ) of the clusters experience core collapse .",
    "this means that seven of the models of cw are disrupted while the corresponding aamodels experience core collapse . in these aa  models core collapse",
    "occurs much later than the disruption time of the cw models ; a too high rate of mass loss in the cw models disrupts the clusters too quickly .",
    "all the clusters which experience core collapse according to cw do experience core collapse according to our calculations also .",
    "core collapse occurs after two - body relaxation starts to dominate the evolution of the clusters , i.e. ; when stellar - evolution mass loss has sufficiently decreased .",
    "since cw s models generally overestimate the rate of mass loss , all models that finally develop a collapsed core according to their calculations experience core collapse in our calculations too .    for @xmath126 and @xmath127 of all the families , both the models of cw and our aa  models experience core collapse .",
    "for these models , the moment of core collapse approximately scales with the initial relaxation time .",
    "this indicates that their evolution is dominated by two - body relaxation , not by stellar evolution . in those cases ,",
    "the differences in the moment of core collapse between cw and aa  models are less than 10% .",
    "the introduction of anisotropy into the models itself does not have very significant effects on the moment of core collapse ( see takahashi 1995 ; takahashi et al .",
    "core collapse proceeds almost independently of the outer parts of the cluster and the anisotropy in the core is always small .",
    "the difference between the energy and apocenter criteria affects mass loss from the tidal boundary , and the mass loss affects core collapse time by reducing the relaxation time .",
    "but the effect of the mass loss on core collapse time is only significant for low - concentration clusters which lose a substantial fraction of their mass before collapse ( cf .",
    "quinlan 1996 ) .",
    "in addition , when mass loss proceeds slowly , on the relaxation time scale , the difference between the apocenter criterion and the energy criterion is less important than when mass loss proceeds more rapidly driven by stellar evolution . the stars which exit in a region lying between the boundary of the energy criterion and that of the apocenter criterion in phase space ( see , takahashi et al .",
    "1997 , fig .",
    "1 ; or tpz , fig .  1 ) are responsible for slower mass loss in apocenter - criterion models .",
    "these stars diffuse over the tidal boundary on a time scale of the order of the relaxation time .",
    "if mass loss by stellar evolution is ineffective and the cluster evolves slowly on the relaxation time scale the difference between apocenter- and energy - criterion models will be small ( cf .",
    "takahashi et al .",
    "1997 ) . on the other hand , if the cluster loses mass rapidly due to stellar evolution compared with the relaxation time scale , the above - mentioned phase - space region will play an important role as a mass reservoir .",
    "we therefore conclude that the moment of core collapse is correctly calculated with isotropic  models as well as with anisotropic models as long as the cluster is relaxation - dominated .",
    "figure [ fig : sur ] gives a graphical representation of table[tab : sur ] for family 1 .",
    "the largest discrepancies occur around a boundary which separates disrupted clusters and collapsing clusters ; the disrupted clusters are on the lower left region and the collapsing clusters are on the upper right region in this figure .    for @xmath128 and @xmath106 of family 1 and 2 ,",
    "the differences in the collapse time between isotropic and anisotropic models are rather large .",
    "these models are near the separating boundary mentioned above ; the cw models of family 1 and 2 collapse but those of family 3 and 4 dissolve . in such cases , even a small difference in the mass loss rate may cause a large difference in the fate of the cluster .",
    "real star clusters contain a finite number of stars , typically @xmath130  @xmath131 .",
    "it is not clear whether this number is large enough to be treated as infinite , though it is usually assumed in calculations .",
    "for example , it is not clear whether the instantaneous escape condition , which is valid for @xmath12 and is adopted in our survey simulations , is a good approximation for typical globular clusters . to test the effect of a finite crossing - time",
    ", we performed a series of calculations by using the crossing - time removal condition , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lo ] ) , with @xmath129 .    figure [ fig : surm - a.3e5.f4 ] presents the mass evolution for models of family 4 with @xmath129 initially .",
    "family 4 has the largest relaxation time and thus has the largest crossing time for fixed @xmath0 .",
    "the initial total masses of these models are @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 , and the crossing times @xmath135 are 0.03  gyr , 0.06  gyr , and 0.10  gyr , for @xmath104 , 2.5 , and 3.5 , respectively . these models are compared with the models with the instantaneous escape condition ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : surm - a ] ) .",
    "the relative difference between the models with @xmath129 and those with @xmath12 for the clusters which dissolve within a few gyr is rather large . in these cases",
    "the models with @xmath129 live a factor of two or three longer than the @xmath15 models .",
    "the lifetime of these clusters is comparable to the crossing time .",
    "the evolution of these models is therefore very sensitive to the way escapers are removed from the clusters ; crossing - time removal or instantaneous removal . for long - lived clusters that survive for a hubble time",
    "the details of how escaping stars are removed become less important ; the instantaneous removal condition gives a good approximation for these cases .",
    "we have shown that our anisotropic  ( aa ) models are in excellent agreement with  models for a wide range of initial conditions . although expected from theoretical considerations , it is still quite striking that a single value of  suffices to achieve agreement between the very different types of numerical models and over such a wide range of initial conditions .",
    "subtle differences between the fokker - planck and  results , however , remain .",
    "these are probably due to the greater detail and higher accuracy of the models compared to the  models .",
    "( the absence of binary formation via three - body processes in the models may also play a role here . ) in some cases , the relatively simplistic implementation of the tidal field via a cut - off radius causes a somewhat peculiar behavior in the  models ( see   [ sec : tfnbody ] ) .",
    "models lose their credibility when the time scale for mass loss becomes comparable to the dynamical time scale , since in that case the assumption of an adiabatic change in the potential is violated .    concerning the models shown in the present paper ,",
    "all the aa  models live longer than the isotropic models . however , there are cases where anisotropic models live longer than isotropic models . for example , takahashi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) show the results that , in the absence of stellar evolution , aa  and ae  models evaporate faster than an isotropic model in the tidal field .",
    "the shorter lifetime of these anisotropic models is induced by two - body relaxation at the inner regions which causes a quick emergence of elongated - orbit stars in the halo .",
    "the apocenters of these stars are frequently outside the tidal radius .",
    "especially when the tidal field is relatively weak mass loss in anisotropic models is quicker than in isotropic models ( see takahashi & lee 1999 for details ) .",
    "the apocenter criterion is considered more realistic than the energy criterion , but also this approach has its limitation .",
    "the implementation of a spherical cutoff radius instead of a self - consistent tidal field , for example , limits the conditions on which escapers are identified .",
    "however , also in a real cluster a star must pass the tidal radius in order to leave the cluster .",
    "the apocenter criterion is therefore an important improvement over the simple energy criterion used in previous calculations .",
    "the implementation of the apocenter criterion , however , requires anisotropic  models ; isotropic  models do not contain sufficient information about the stars orbits to apply the apocenter criterion .",
    "unfortunately it seems hard to adjust the energy criterion used in isotropic models such that the mass loss rate becomes similar to that for the apocenter criterion .",
    "this is because the apocenter criterion causes the cluster s mass - loss rate to depend on the angular - momentum distribution ( anisotropy ) of the stars near the tidal boundary , and the anisotropy behaves in a rather complex way : it changes with time , and depends on the mass of the stars and the distance to the cluster center ( takahashi 1997 ; takahashi et al .",

    "it is convenient to set a cut - off radius even for the calculations where a tidal field is used .",

    "all the models presented in figure [ fig : w3a2.5f1.1k.mass ] are indistinguishable for the first one billion years , where mass loss is dominated by stellar evolution .",
    "after that , model tcr1 and model tfr1 start to lose mass more rapidly than the other models .",
    "this acceleration in mass loss is related to a too sudden removal of escaping stars which is caused by the small cut - off radius .",
    "model tfr1 keeps losing mass at a rate slightly higher than the other tidal - field models .",
    "after about 2 gyr the mass loss rate of model tcr1 becomes smaller than for the models with a tidal field .",
    "not surprisingly , stars are removed more quickly if a tidal field is incorporated and stars are removed at @xmath8 .",
    "figure [ fig : w3a2.5f1.1k.mass ] shows that an artificial cut - off radius in excess of 2  hardly affects the results in the models where a self - consistent tidal field is incorporated .    the fokker - planck model with 1k stars ( see figure [ fig : fp - nb]a ) loses more mass in the first billion years than the  models ( tcr1 , tfr1 to tfr100 ) .",
    "this difference may be caused by the assumed adiabatic response of the  models to changes in the potential ( cohn 1979 ) .",
    "the cluster loses about 30% of its initial mass within 1  gyr .",
    "since the initial half - mass crossing time is about 0.5  gyr , this change in the potential is quite impulsive . in spite of this breakdown of one of the fundamental assumptions in models ,",

    "the effect of stellar evolution is dominant , time scaling based on the crossing time is applied . at later stages ,",
    "when two - body relaxation becomes dominant , the relaxation time is used for time scaling .",

    "such a mass function only appears in clusters which have lost @xmath178 of their initial mass on the relaxation time scale .",
    "these `` remnant '' clusters were formerly the cores of more massive clusters .",
    "high mass stars are over - abundant in such cores as a result of mass segregation .",
    "the mass function of the globular cluster ngc 6712 around the half - light radius also peaks near @xmath179 ( de marchi et al .",
    "1999 ) , and looks similar to the mass function shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : w7a1.5f3.mf ] .",
    "( although fig .",
    "[ fig : w7a1.5f3.mf ] shows the global mass function , the local mass function at the half - mass radius is similar to that . )",
    "de marchi et al .  ( 1999 ) interpreted the observed inverted mass function as evidence for severe tidal disruption , which is consistent with the above model . thus we suspect that ngc 6712 was born far more massive than what it is today . with the current mass of @xmath180 ( pryor & meylan 1993 ) , its initial",
    "mass would be @xmath181 , if that model is applied . however , this prediction of the initial mass is rather uncertain quantitatively , because our survey is limited in many respects .",
    "the range of initial conditions covered by our survey is still limited , as mentioned above .",
    "further we assume a steady tidal field .",
    "the orbit of ngc 6712 is , in fact , likely to be very eccentric ; the cluster is presently at @xmath182 kpc , but the minimum and maximum galactocentric distances are predicted to be about 0.3 kpc and 7 kpc , respectively ( dauphole et al .",
    "1996 ) . therefore , bulge and disk shocks ( see gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; murali & weinberg 1997 ; and references therein ) have probably affected the mass evolution of this cluster considerably , as pointed out by de marchi et al .  ( 1999 ) .",
    "since we argued above that berkeley 17 may be represented by the model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : w7a1.5f3.mf ] , it will be interesting to observe the mass function of berkeley 17 down to very low mass stars .",
    "we have investigated the evolution of star clusters including the effects of the tidal field of the parent galaxy and mass loss from stellar evolution by using _ anisotropic _",
    "models as well as models . our new  models , which include a new implementation of the tidal field , agree much better with models than _ isotropic _ models .",
    "the new implementation of the tidal boundary consists of two parts : the apocenter criterion assures that only those stars are removed from the stellar system for which apocenter radius exceeds the tidal radius of the cluster ; the crossing - time removal condition prevents escaping stars from being removed in an infinitesimal time step , but keeps them in the stellar system for some time of the order of the crossing - time .",
    "the crossing - time removal introduces an additional free parameter , , to the model .",
    "we find that a single value of @xmath67 provides good agreement between  and  calculations over a wide range of initial conditions .",
    "these improvements to the model allow us to perform calculations in much wider ranges of parameter space , including varying the number of stars .",
    "this opens the possibility to compare  calculations directly with direct  calculations .    with the improved model we have studied the evolution of globular clusters over a wide range of initial conditions .",
    "the surveyed initial parameters are identical to those adopted by cw .",
    "our clusters live generally longer than the isotropic models of cw .",
    "the largest differences appear in cases where clusters dissolve promptly in the tidal field before core collapse occurs , except for cases of too prompt dissolution due to too severe mass loss via stellar evolution .",
    "for some initial conditions , our models reach core collapse , while the models of cw dissolve .",
    "the differences are rather small for long - lived clusters which start with steep mass functions and high concentrations and finally reach core collapse .",
    "these findings are consistent with the conclusions of aarseth & heggie ( 1998 ) who compare their  models with the models of cw .",
    "about half of the clusters calculated in our survey are disrupted within 10gyr .",
    "only four of our 36 samples experience core collapse within 10  gyr , and two of the four have lost more than 99% of their mass at the moment of core collapse .",
    "this suggests that the range of the initial conditions with which clusters reach core collapse within the age of the universe is rather small in our survey . on the other hand , about 20% of the known galactic globular clusters are classified as post - collapse clusters ( djorgovski & king 1986 ; chernoff & djorgovski 1989 ; trager et al .",
    "these post - collapse clusters might have been born with initial conditions that are preferable for core collapse at @xmath141 gyr , e.g. , @xmath69 and @xmath183 .",
    "however it should be noted that not all of possible initial conditions of real globular clusters are covered by our ( and cw s ) survey .",
    "in particular the adopted initial mass functions are probably not the best choice .    in the survey",
    "we find a few peculiar models which have very small masses ( @xmath148 1% of the initial mass ) but are well concentrated at @xmath14810gyr .",
    "such clusters happen to be classified as old open clusters , like berkeley 17 , rather than as globular clusters , depending on their luminosities , appearances , and positions relative to the galactic disk .",
    "the present - day global mass functions of these model clusters are also peculiar in the sense that they decrease with decreasing stellar mass",
    ". a similar inverted mass function was observed in the globular cluster ngc 6712 by de marchi et al .",
    "this indicates that ngc 6712 might have lost a very large fraction of its initial mass , if the observed mass function is really close to the global mass function and does not only reflect a peculiarity of the initial mass function of the cluster .",
    "clusters which lose @xmath154% of their initial mass in a very short time scale may still survive for a long time . the principle that losing more than a half of the initial mass of a cluster inevitably results in disruption is based on the virial theorem and on the assumption of impulsive mass loss ( hills 1980 ) . for the initial conditions of @xmath86 , @xmath104 , and family 4 , more than half the cluster mass",
    "is lost within a few half - mass crossing times ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fp - nb]e ) .",
    "but , in fact , still the cluster survives for more than ten billion years and finally experiences core collapse .",
    "comparison between  calculations with various implementations of the galactic tidal field and the cut - off boundary condition indicates that there may be a significant population of stars which are trapped outside the tidal radius of the cluster but are still bound to the stellar system .",
