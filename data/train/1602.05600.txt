    "the aqs built in this way has an important feature : the tunability of @xmath28 through external fields enables to tune the ratio @xmath76 of the parameters of the fermi - hubbard model .",

    "the shaded area indicates ( roughly ) the allowed range of values of the external phase : if we choose @xmath74 too small the value of @xmath28 will drop below the qubit linewidth , if we choose it too large , the transmons susceptibility to noise increases .",
    "the sign of @xmath41 can be switched by reversing the external flux in either the upper or the lower chain of qubits , hence we can simulate repulsive or attractive on - site interactions .",
    "both types of couplings discussed here have energies that are small compared to the qubit energy splitting , i.e. , @xmath79 . for transmons",
    "this restriction is needed , since they are effectively anharmonic oscillators and the coupling strengths have to be weaker than the anharmonicity .",
    "otherwise excitations of energy levels higher than the two logical states of the qubits play a role .",
    "this imposes a serious restriction on the parameters of the fermi - hubbard model  , namely it effectively amounts to @xmath80 .",
    "this means we can explore equilibrium properties of the system only in the limit of very low particle number .",
    "we are , however , able to excite in a controlled way some of the qubits in the system and therefore initiate particles in the aqs .",
    "if the frequencies of the qubits to be excited are initially tuned far from the other ones in the aqs , and then tuned again to degeneracy adiabatically after the excitation , we should arrive in the ground state of the fermi - hubbard model with a given number of particles .",
    "furthermore , after initiating specific excitations in the aqs , we can study the resulting non - equilibrium properties .",
    "this is especially interesting , as such properties are hard to treat either analytically or numerically . for this nonequilibrium dynamics",
    "there is no restriction on the filling of the system ; i.e. , we cover a wider range of parameters than in the equilibrium case .",
    "the fabrication process of the transmon josephson junctions is not precise enough to guarantee the josephson energies to be exactly equal ( on the energy scale of the couplings ) . on the other hand",
    ", the qubit energies of the emulator s qubits have to be degenerate . for this reason , the proposed circuit in fig .",
    "[ fig : qubit - circuit ] includes separate magnetic fields to tune individually each transmon .",
    "this extension should be manageable , adding one dc connection for each of the transmons to create the local fields .",
    "in addition , the individual tunability is useful for the initialization and readout , as well as for protocols to be used as tests of the quality of the simulation .    as an initialization scheme we suggest to couple a part of the qubit system capacitively to a transmission line as a feed line for external signals . by pairwise detuning the qubits in this part the @xmath1 interaction between the transmons can be suppressed , which allows addressing every qubit individually through a resonant microwave pulse .",
    "hence , one can excite specific qubits to initialize a desired configuration of excitations in the aqs .",
    "note that the @xmath2 interaction may only lead to an effective frequency shift for the excitation of a qubit , depending on whether the partner qubit is already excited or not .",
    "bringing the transmons back to degeneracy turns the @xmath1 exchange interaction back on , which will start the simulation .",
    "readout can be performed through the usual method of projective measurement in the dispersive regime .",
    "we couple resonators to the system , with frequencies far from the qubit frequencies during the simulation .",
    "individual qubits are then tuned out of degeneracy to enter the dispersive regime of a resonator .",
    "this way , we can measure the time evolution of the operator @xmath25 for each transmon .",
    "an important issue to address is the quality of the results produced by the aqs  @xcite .",
    "the aqs does not have error correction implemented .",
    "deviations of the qubit system , where disorder effects can not be avoided , from the ideal model hamiltonian   will modify conclusions to be drawn for the fermi - hubbard system , a problem which is largely unexplored . here",
    "we propose tests which may help gaining confidence through several sorts of measurements .",
    "\\(i ) one option is to check symmetries of the system . in our case",
    ", it is easy to see from the hamiltonian   that the total number of excitations in the spin - up as well as the spin - down chain should be conserved separately .",
    "furthermore , both chains should be equal , hence equal properties should be observed in both chains .",
    "in addition , for a sufficiently large system with negligible boundary effects , we expect translational symmetry along the chains .",
    "\\(ii ) if one creates fermions only in one of the chains ( by exciting the corresponding qubits ) , one finds effectively a tight - binding model . in this case , the simulation results could be easily compared to analytic results .",
    "\\(iii ) another option is to limit the system size of the aqs such that results could be compared to simulations on a classical computer . to do this",
    ", one does not need to build a small aqs .",
    "rather , by tuning the coupling strengths it is possible to switch off the exchange interaction along the chains at a specific position .",
    "this will localize the excitations in one part of the simulator , and a comparison between the measurements of the smaller subsystem with numerical simulations could be possible .",
    "such measurements help in evaluating the quality of the emulator s results . beyond such tests",
    "one should investigate the effects of disorder in the parameters of the emulator .",
    "first steps in this direction show for certain models ( including the fermi - hubbard model ) a remarkable stability of the aqs against disorder , which arises due to the symmetries  @xcite .",
    "a limitation of the proposed emulator arises due to the limited coherence time of the qubits .",
    "but we estimate that qubit designs are available with sufficient quality to simulate the quantum state evolution on interesting , long time scales before decoherence dominates the dynamics .",
    "the effects of a bath coupled to a quantum emulator have been investigated in part  @xcite but need to be explored further . for a first estimate we have to compare the microscopic time scales with the decoherence time , or inversely , the coupling energies with the decoherence rate .",
    "for example , for the xmon qubit coherence times of the order of @xmath81 to @xmath82 were reported  @xcite , corresponding to rates from @xmath83 down to @xmath84 .",
    "these rates are orders of magnitude smaller than the capacitive coupling energies ranging from @xmath85 to @xmath86 .",
    "while this ratio looks very promising , we have to note that it is unclear how the required magnetic coupling can be realized with the xmon design .",
    "therefore , we concentrated in this paper on the concentric transmon  @xcite , for which coherence times of the order of @xmath81 and capacitive coupling energies between @xmath85 and @xmath86 appear possible as well , and which allows for the magnetic coupling .",
    "first estimates for the magnetic coupling between two adjacent qubits yielded results only slightly above the decoherence rate , but proper adjustments in the circuit should provide sufficiently strong coupling energies ( see appx .",
    "[ appx : experimental - realization ] ) .",
    "an actual quantity of interest in an emulation is a time- and space - dependent correlation function of the fermi - hubbard model on time scales which significantly exceed the microscopic time scales given by the inverse of the hopping matrix elements and the interaction strength .",
    "accordingly , the correlation functions of the qubit circuit should be studied for times significantly exceeding the equivalent microscopic time scales determined by the inter - qubit couplings  .",
    "these time scales have to be compared with the coherence time of the @xmath87-qubit double chain circuit . in the extreme case , if we are interested in long - range correlation functions , say of sites at opposite ends of the system , the relevant coherence time is reduced by a factor @xmath87 as compared to the single - qubit coherence time . thus , even with very promising ratios between single - qubit decoherence rates and coupling strengths , the study of long - range correlation functions is more difficult .",
    "but for not too large @xmath18 ( say between 10 and 100 ) it should be possible to study with present technology the time dependence of correlation functions in an interesting regime .",
    "we finally note that with our proposed emulator we are in a much more favorable situation than with a digital quantum computer ( without error correction ) , where the simulation of the time evolution ( according to the trotter formula ) requires executing a very large number of quantum gates making the limitations due to the finite coherence time much more serious .",
    "a double chain of qubits with @xmath1 and @xmath2 couplings of neighboring qubits along and between the chains , respectively , can be mapped via the jordan - wigner transformation on a spin - full 1d fermi - hubbard model .",
    "the qubit system can thus be used to emulate the quantum properties of this model .",
    "it constitutes a different approach to , e.g. , digital quantum emulation of the fermi - hubbard model with superconducting circuits  @xcite , or a recent effort with an emulator based on dopant atoms in a semiconductor  @xcite .",
    "we analyzed different physical implementations of such analog quantum simulators .",
    "the conceptually simplest , with the broadest range of available parameters and highest flexibility is a realization based on an array of josephson charge qubits .",
    "it would also allow simulations corresponding to half - filling of the fermionic problem .",
    "unfortunately , josephson charge qubits suffer from the strong dependence on background charge fluctuations , which makes them difficult to handle in experiments .",
    "an alternative would be provided by using junctions based on phase slip processes  @xcite . for arrays built with such devices disorder effects",
    "should be much weaker  @xcite which should make it worthwhile investing into this new technology . because they are widely used nowadays , we discussed in detail tunable transmon qubits , where the @xmath2 interaction arises due to an inductive coupling and the @xmath1 interaction due to a capacitive interaction",
    ". this appears a promising approach as far as the experimental realization is concerned , and therefore it is discussed in more detail in appx .",
