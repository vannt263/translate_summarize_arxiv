    "general diffeomorphism invariance is a central property of general relativity ( gr ) . in particular , it means that all foliations of space - time ( say by space - like hypersurfaces ) are equivalent . for many pratical purposes a choice of foliation",
    "must be made , which can be achieved , for instance , by an adm decomposition of space - time @xcite .",
    "the ten metric degrees of freedom are then decomposed into the lapse , shift and 3-metric , of which only the latter contains physical information .",
    "the lapse and the shift are pure gauge , as it is manifest in the fact that their equations of motion are actually constraints .",
    "such constraints need only be imposed in one leaf of the foliation and are guaranteed to be preserved in the evolution .",
    "the number of physical degrees of freedom of the theory can be formally computed by dirac s theory of constrained systems @xcite . for gr",
    "there are 20 phase space variables and 8 first class constraints , leading to @xmath1 degrees of freedom .",
    "these are the two polarisations of the graviton , which are clearly seen by studying plane waves in linearised theory , corresponding to trace - free , transverse , tensor modes .",
    "any theory of gravity for which general diffeomorphism invariance is broken will have , generically , a different number of physical degrees of freedom .",
    "an example is when the full diffeomorphism invariance is broken to foliation preserving diffeormorphisms ( fpd ) .",
    "this type of symmetry has been extensively discussed in recent years in the context of hoava - lifschitz ( hl ) gravity @xcite . under this smaller symmetry ,",
    "the shift can still be gauged away , but the lapse ( and the conformal mode , cf .",
    "section [ 312 ] ) acquires physical significance . as a manifestation ,",
    "the equation of motion of the lapse , the hamiltonian constraint @xmath2 , is not preserved in the evolution : the evolution of @xmath2 is actually a dynamical equation for the lapse .",
    "naively , this seems to introduce one new degree of freedom . in the non - projectable class of hl theories ,",
    "however , a formal counting , based on the fact that the hamiltonian constraint becomes second class and the lapse is determined ( removing two phase space variables ) , gives @xmath3 degrees of freedom @xcite . getting one half degree of freedom might not necessarily be problematic in itself .",
    "there are , however , at least three problematic features related to the existence of this new half degree of freedom in hl gravity .",
    "the first problem concerns the absence of dynamics and is associated to the fact that the extra degree of freedom is halved . for generic asymptotically flat space - times , the lapse is forced to be zero at spatial infinity @xcite .",
    "actually , for particular values of the couplings , it was shown ( and suggested this could be the case for generic values of the couplings ) that the lapse must vanish everywhere .",
    "this indicates that there is no dynamics in hl gravity .",
    "the second problem is the short distance instability the scalar mode might trigger ( if the dynamics was not frozen ) . looking at perturbations around generic backgrounds ,",
    "it was found in @xcite that the high frequency modes of the extra degree of freedom develop an imaginary part and the perturbations can grow very swiftly in time .",
    "the third problem is the self - coupling of the scalar mode which remains strong to very low energy scales @xcite .",
    "this implies that the extra scalar mode never decouples and thus hl gravity does not flow to gr in the ir as it was hoped .",
    "recently , another model of gravity for which the full diffeomorphism invariance is broken to fpd was proposed by some of us @xcite : @xmath0-dbi gravity .",
    "this model was designed to reduce to the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) scalar field theory for conformally flat geometries ; it was motivated by the observation that for such geometries , in a cosmological setup , two epochs of acceleration for the universe are naturally obtained @xcite .",
    "subsequently , we observed in @xcite that a large class of exact solutions of gr ( including the most standard spherical black hole solutions , in the most standard foliations ) are solutions of @xmath0-dbi gravity .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is twofold .",
    "firstly , to understand what are the extra degrees of freedom present in @xmath0-dbi gravity due to the breakdown of full diffeomorphism invariance . secondly , to investigate whether @xmath0-dbi gravity is afflicted by problems similar to those described above in the context of hl gravity .    concerning the first part of our investigation , we shall show that @xmath0-dbi gravity possesses one extra degree of freedom , as compared to gr , that this degree of freedom is a scalar graviton and that its existence is a direct consequence of the breakdown of the full diffeomorphisms group to fpd .",
    "this shall be done in sections 3 and 4 , first by considering perturbations around minkowski spacetime and then by considering the fully non - linear @xmath0-dbi theory . concerning the second part of our investigation , we shall present arguments , in section 5 , that none of the aforementioned problems that afflict hl gravity are present in @xmath0-dbi .",
    "this healthy behaviour is intimately connected with the nonlinear lapse dependence in @xmath0-dbi , as compared to hl gravity .",
    "indeed , @xmath0-dbi gravity naturally contains lapse dependent terms in the action , analogous to those suggested in @xcite for the consistent extension of hl gravity .",
    "the analysis in sections 4 and 5 can be made simpler by introducing alternative forms for @xmath0-dbi gravity .",
    "one alternative form linearizes the action , i.e. eliminates the awkward square root dependence , by introducing an auxiliary field .",
    "another alternative form makes the action covariant , by introducing a stckelberg field .",
    "these alternative forms are introduced in section 2 .",
    "we shall conclude , in section 6 , by discussing more on the stability and commenting on future research directions for understanding this model .",
    "some technicalities are presented in three appendices .",
    "the action for @xmath0-dbi gravity without matter is @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is newton s constant , @xmath6 are the two dimensionless parameters of the theory and @xmath7 is the four dimensional ricci scalar . to completely define the theory a foliation structure must be chosen .",

    "the consistency requires the time flows of the primary constraints to vanish ( herein @xmath54 means ` weakly equal ' as standard in dirac s theory ) : @xmath55 the former corresponds to the hamiltonian constraint and the latter to the momentum constraint , as will become clear in the next section .",

    "a few remarks are in order : firstly , this is a key equation , despite its extremely simple appearance , and notably originates from the nonlinear lapse term @xmath63 in the hamiltonian ; secondly , as we will see in section [ pathologies1 ] , the stckelberg field satisfies exactly the same equation and thus can be identified with the broken gauge degree of freedom @xmath94 .",

    "similarly , plugging ( [ 11.0 ] ) into ( [ d6 ] ) , the constraints @xmath122 yield @xmath123 these are the momentum constraints in @xcite .",

    "we shall now address some potential pathologies associated with the existence of the scalar graviton , which are known to afflict hl gravity .",
    "one of the most serious problems of hl gravity is the absence of dynamics discussed in @xcite .",
    "the problem is that the time flow of the hamiltonian constraint yields an independent constraint on the lapse , which , as it turns out , requires the lapse to identically vanish in asymptotically flat space - times , implying that hl gravity does not have any dynamics .",
    "the authors of @xcite emphasise that this problem is intimately related to the fact that in hl gravity the hamiltonian constraint is second class .    in @xmath0-dbi gravity , the hamiltonian constraint is also second class .",
    "this raises the concern that this model might also lack dynamics .",
    "however , this problem is evaded in a similar way as the consistent extension of hl gravity does .",
    "namely , the time flow of the hamiltonian constraint , given by ( [ ap1 ] ) in the full theory , does not yield an additional constraint unlike hl gravity ; rather it determines the lagrange multiplier @xmath131 , since the hamiltonian constraint @xmath59 depends on the auxiliary field @xmath18 ( and implicitly on the lapse @xmath12 through @xmath18 by solving @xmath132 ) and thus @xmath133 .",
    "this stems from the _ nonlinear _ lapse dependence in the @xmath0-dbi action and can be seen more clearly in the linearised theory in section [ gravexists ] : which linearises the lapse dependence . ]",
    "the time flow of the hamiltonian constraint @xmath59 is generated by its commutator with the hamiltonian density ( [ hamper3 ] ) . because of the lapse term @xmath134 in the hamiltonian constraint descended from the nonlinear lapse term @xmath63 in the action , the coefficient @xmath135 of the lagrange multiplier @xmath52 is non - vanishing .",
    "thus , such time flow determines @xmath52 rather than imposing an extra constraint on the lapse .    to summarize , the nonlinear lapse dependence intrinsic to @xmath0-dbi gravity rescues the model from the absence of dynamics .      in @xcite",
    "it was found that the scalar graviton in hl gravity develops an exponential time growth at short distances in generic space - times in the linearised approximation .",
    "this suggests the presence of a universal short distance instability in hl gravity .",
    "such problem , however , should be considered with some caution .",
    "the exponentially growing mode involves the lapse ; but the lapse in asymptotically flat space - times is forced to vanish everywhere @xcite , as mentioned in the previous section . if the lapse must collapse everywhere , there would be no way to develop an exponentially growing mode involving the lapse .",
    "thus there appears to be a contradiction between these two issues .",
    "this might imply that the unstable scalar mode found in @xcite fails to obey the boundary condition at spatial infinity , when extended to long distances . in any case , as we have just shown , the lapse does not vanish in our model and so it is sensible and important to study whether the scalar mode leads to any sort of instability or not .",
    "we shall now show that the analysis that reveals an exponential time growth at short scales in hl gravity , does not allow the same conclusion when applied to the scalar graviton in @xmath0-dbi .",
    "we begin by recasting the equations of motion of @xmath0-dbi gravity : @xmath136 where @xmath137 and the cosmological constant @xmath138 .",

    "represent the modification from gr .",
    "in fact , when the auxiliary field @xmath18 is constant , the r.h.s . vanish except for the cosmological constant in the hamiltonian constraint ( [ eqham ] ) , and these equations become those of gr , as remarked in section [ auxfield ] . as we have seen in ( [ scalargravitoneq ] ) in section [ 312 ] , the time - derivative of the hamiltonian constraint succinctly captures the scalar mode dynamics , and it can be written as @xmath139    we now consider small perturbations around a generic background in the gauge @xmath140 : @xmath141 the details of the following analysis can be found in appendix [ perturbation_eq_motion ] .",
    "we assume that the background space - time varies over the characteristic scale @xmath76 ; @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 .",
    "since we are interested in a potential universal short distance instability , we focus on scales much shorter than @xmath76 ; , p 1/l  , [ assumption ] where the space - time is nearly flat .",
    "we can then neglect terms with space - time derivatives of the background fields relative to those of the perturbed fields . assuming the fourier decompositions @xmath147 the perturbations of ( [ eqmetric])([eqevol ] ) and @xmath148 yield ( [ pert_metric])([pert_evol ] ) and ( [ pert_scalar ] ) , respectively .",
    "we then find that for the scalar mode to be present @xmath149 at first sight , it might seem to imply the existence of an exponentially growing mode , suggesting an instability . this relation , however , violates the validity of our approximation ( [ assumption ] ) and thus can not be satisfied .",
    "we conclude that this analysis does not reveal a potential universal short distance instability as discussed in the hl case @xcite .",
    "note that this also implies that there is no scalar mode of the type @xmath150 at short distances .",
    ", the scalar mode _ does exist _ , but it has @xmath97 .",
    "this can also be seen in the stckelberg formalism , cf .",
    "( [ phi3 ] ) .",
    "the scalar mode is neither exponentially growing nor oscillating to linear order .",
    "we will discuss more about the scalar mode in section [ conclusion ] . ]",
    "the same conclusion can be reached by an alternative analysis using the stckelberg field @xmath28 .",
    "we leave the details of the analysis in appendix [ perturbation_stuckelberg ] .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath28 can be obtained from the action ( [ dbigravitycovariant ] ) .",
    "the preferred choice of time - like vector @xmath151 corresponds to @xmath29 .",
    "indeed , the equation of motion ( [ eq_scalar ] ) for @xmath28 reduces , when @xmath29 , to the time derivative of the hamiltonian constraint ( [ eqscalar ] ) .",

    "we conclude by remarking that , as advertised , @xmath155 can be identified with the broken gauge parameter @xmath94 .",
    "since in flat space - time ( [ phi3 ] ) yields @xmath156 , we obtain precisely the scalar graviton equation ( [ scalargravitoneq ] ) whose origin can be traced to the nonlinear lapse term ( observe also that ( [ phi3 ] ) is the time derivative of the linearised hamiltonian constraint ) .",
    "this provides a consistency check of our computations .",
    "naively , @xmath0-dbi gravity admits the gr limit by tuning the parameter @xmath157 and @xmath158 with @xmath159 fixed finite .",
    "however , as is well - known , it is subtle and far from obvious whether the extra scalar mode actually decouples in the ir in the putative gr limit .",
    "a famous example is the vdvz discontinuity of massive gravity @xcite which can be attributed to the strongly coupled nature of a scalar mode , as elucidated in @xcite .",
    "massive gravity has three extra modes ; a transverse spin one and a scalar mode . as it turned out , the scalar mode remains strongly coupled in the massless limit and thus the gr limit does not exist .",
    "the original form of hl gravity has a similar strong coupling problem @xcite ; there is an energy scale @xmath160 above which the scalar mode self - coupling becomes strong . for hl gravity to flow to gr in the ir",
    ", the strong coupling scale @xmath160 needs to be sufficiently high so that the coupling becomes weak and virtually decouples in the ir .",
    "however , as it turned out , the naive estimate of the strong coupling scale yields a value too low , @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is an anisotropy parameter and the coefficient of the @xmath163 term ; this is most manifest in the stckelberg field formalism .",
    "the part of the stckelberg field action , coming from the @xmath163 term , is proportional to @xmath164 .",
    "this is the most relevant part of the action in the ir .",
    "this implies that the coupling is @xmath165 and thus irrelevant .",
    "although the coupling becomes weak in the ir , the strong coupling scale @xmath160 is too low , approaching zero in the putative gr limit @xmath166 .",
    "in fact , as argued in @xcite , the situation appears to be even worse .",
    "the quadratic action in flat space lacks time derivatives , while there are time derivative interactions .",
    "this may imply that the high frequency modes are always strongly coupled .",
    "indeed , one can refine the estimate of the strong coupling scale by making the space - time slightly curved ( with the characteristic length scale @xmath76 ) which introduces a quadratic term with a time derivative .",
    "then the refined strong coupling scale becomes anisotropic and is estimated to be @xmath167 and @xmath168 @xcite . in the flat space limit @xmath169 , these are in fact zero .    in @xmath0-dbi ,",
    "the situation turns out to be more subtle .",
    "the stckelberg field action in flat space in unitary gauge yields @xmath170 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to cubic order , as shown in appendix [ perturbation_stuckelberg2 ] .",
    "the quadratic action is invariant under the scaling @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , and @xmath174 .",
    "first note that the last interaction is irrelevant as compared to the middle ones .",
    "the higher order interactions have a similar structure .",
    "so the most  relevant \" terms are of the middle type and actually ( classically ) marginal , with coupling @xmath175 , for the @xmath0-th order in @xmath153 .. ] however , due to quantum effects , these operators may become either relevant or irrelevant . for the cubic terms with coupling @xmath176 , the beta function at @xmath177-loop is of the form @xmath178 , from which one obtains @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the energy scale and the uv cutoff scale is @xmath181 .",
    "therefore , the strong coupling scale is @xmath182 this implies that in the putative gr limit @xmath183 , the strong coupling scale is about the planck scale and thus sufficiently high .",
    "however , for this coupling to be ( marginally ) irrelevant , the constant @xmath184 must be negative .",
    "given the fact that this is a scalar field theory and the higher derivative nature of the operators , it seems plausible that this is actually the case .",
    "therefore , @xmath0-dbi gravity is likely to be free from the strong coupling problem .",
    "the first main result of this paper is to have established that @xmath0-dbi gravity has three degrees of freedom : the usual two tensorial modes of the graviton plus a scalar mode which , however , is not a propagating particle with a definite dispersion relation .",
    "the second result is that the arguments for three pathological features of the original formulation of hl gravity do not carry over to @xmath0-dbi gravity ; these arguments concern the absence of dynamics , a universal short distance instability , and a strong coupling issue .",
    "the reason why @xmath0-dbi looks healthier than hl gravity , in these respects , has a common ground : the nonlinear dependence on ( spatial derivatives of ) the lapse in the action .",
    "the fact that the same arguments for the pathologies in hl gravity do not directly apply to @xmath0-dbi gravity does not mean , of course , that the latter is free of pathologies .",
    "although the arguments presented herein are reassuring , in order to establish an healthy behaviour , @xmath0-dbi gravity must be further studied . in particular",
    ", we found that the scalar mode grows linearly in time in the linear approximation and is thus at the threshold between stability ( oscillation ) and instability ( exponential growth ) .",
    "in other words , the scalar mode can be either marginally stable or unstable .",
    "the ( in)stability depends on the details of the scalar mode interactions .",
    "we thus need to extend the analysis performed in section [ 312 ] beyond linear order to establish the ( in)stability of the scalar mode .    to study the effect of nonlinear interactions , we find it useful to work in the einstein frame ( [ einstein ] ) .",
    "note that the background space - time remains flat under the frame change .",
    "a key observation is that , as suggested in appendix [ einstein_frame ] , the auxiliary field @xmath24 can essentially be thought of as the time derivative of the scalar mode , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath185 .",
    "in other words , the proof of the stability amounts to showing the stability of the @xmath24 fluctuation .",
    "in fact , the equation of motion for @xmath24 in the @xmath140 gauge @xmath186 seems to indicate the stability against small perturbations around @xmath187 ; as is clear , the potential @xmath188 plotted in fig.[v ] is very stable around @xmath187 .",
    "note , however , that the lapse @xmath12 and the spatial metric @xmath14 also furnish the scalar mode .",
    "moreover , the auxiliary field @xmath24 is further constrained by the other equations of motion .",
    "so , strictly speaking , we need to deal with the coupled system of @xmath24 , @xmath12 and @xmath14 ( in the @xmath140 gauge ) .",
    "there is , however , a shortcut : it would be sufficient to show that the solutions of ( [ psi_eqn ] ) for @xmath24 in _ generic backgrounds _ are oscillatory .",
    "the force in ( [ psi_eqn ] ) consists of the strongly attractive force @xmath189 , the repulsive force @xmath190 , the friction @xmath191 , and the external force @xmath192 .",
    "the last three forces may work against stability .",
    "these become more dominant when @xmath24 is smaller .",
    "however , the small @xmath24 behaviour is well approximated by the linear perturbation .",
    "as shown in appendix [ einstein_frame ] , @xmath24 is marginally stable to linear order .",
    "meanwhile , for larger @xmath24 , the attractive force , being exponential , may quickly become dominant , as @xmath24 increases , and pull it back to smaller @xmath24 .",
    "hence it seems plausible that @xmath24 oscillates about @xmath187 .",
    "we therefore conclude that @xmath0-dbi gravity is likely to be stable against the scalar mode perturbations .",
    "defined in ( [ potential ] ) with @xmath41,height=192 ]    to close , we have considerably improved our understanding of the scalar mode and presented arguments for its healthy behaviour . however , the scalar mode still remains somewhat elusive ; it does not appear to behave as a conventional particle with a ( non-)relativistic dispersion relation around near - flat space - times .",
    "so it is rather unclear what signatures exactly it might leave as an observable . on this score , however , we anticipate that the scalar mode could be the source of scalar perturbations in the cosmic microwave background radiation , when applied to inflationary cosmology @xcite , and we hope to return to this question in the near future .",
    "finally , we believe that models such as @xmath0-dbi gravity are interesting learning grounds for deepening our understanding of ( non-)relativistic gravity . needless to say , hurdles are high to self - consistently modify einstein s elegant theory of general relativity .",
