    "this paper discusses the dispersion and mean trends of @xmath0-process abundances ( @xmath0-abundances ) in `` metal - poor '' stars ( with @xmath2}\\lesssim -1 $ ] ) based on a model of diverse supernova sources for the @xmath0-process inferred from meteoritic data .",
    "wasserburg , busso , & gallino ( 1996 ) showed that meteoritic data on the @xmath3i and @xmath4hf inventory in the early solar system require two distinct frequencies for replenishment of the @xmath0-nuclei below and above mass number @xmath5 in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the frequency required for replenishment of the heavy @xmath0-nuclei ( @xmath6 ) is @xmath7 while that for the light @xmath0-nuclei ( @xmath8 ) is @xmath9 times less .",
    "these frequencies are consistent with the occurrence of type ii supernovae ( snii ) in an average galactic ism ( wasserburg et al .",
    "1996 ; see also  2 ) .",
    "the possible realization of different @xmath0-process production in two distinct kinds of snii sources , the @xmath10 ( high - frequency , mainly producing the heavy @xmath0-nuclei ) and @xmath11 ( low - frequency , mainly producing the light @xmath0-nuclei ) events , was discussed by qian , vogel , & wasserburg ( 1998 ) . based on the solar system data , qian & wasserburg ( 2000 , qw ) calculated the @xmath0-abundances resulting from a single @xmath10 or @xmath11 event .",
    "wasserburg & qian ( 2000 , wq ) showed that the results of qw were in general agreement with existing observations of metal - poor stars .",
    "the approach of qw and wq is further developed here to study the dispersion in the abundance of a given @xmath0-element at a given metallicity , with the aim to gain some new insights into the evolution of @xmath0-abundances relative to fe and to test snii as the @xmath0-process site .",
    "the element eu or ag is chosen as the typical heavy or light @xmath0-element , respectively , for discussion .",
    "it is shown in  2 that the model of diverse snii sources for the @xmath0-process inferred from meteoritic data provides a good explanation for the observed dispersion and mean trend of eu abundances in metal - poor stars .",
    "it is also shown in  3 that this model provides a means to discuss @xmath0-abundances in general .",
    "for example , the ag abundance in any metal - poor star with observed eu and fe abundances can be calculated from the model .",
    "this approach is demonstrated with success for two stars and can be further tested by future ag data .",
    "the dispersion and mean trend of ag abundances in metal - poor stars are also calculated for comparison with future observations .",
    "refinements of the model are discussed and conclusions given in  4 .",
    "consider the following simple picture for chemical enrichment of the galactic ism by snii ( e.g. , qian 2000 ) .",
    "the ejecta of any individual snii is mixed with a fixed amount of ism corresponding to the total mass swept up by an snii remnant , @xmath12 ( e.g. , thornton et al .",
    "the snii rate per unit mass of gas @xmath13 is assumed to be constant over galactic history .",
    "consequently , an average ism in the galaxy is enriched in the nucleosynthetic products from snii at a frequency @xmath14 \\left({10^{10}\\,m_\\odot\\over m_{\\rm gas}}\\right ) , \\label{fmix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is estimated using quantities for the present galaxy .",
    "the frequency of @xmath10 events inferred from the meteoritic data is @xmath15 and that of @xmath11 events is @xmath16 . for definiteness , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are used below .",
    "it is further assumed that all snii are either @xmath10 or @xmath11 events , with the average fraction of each kind being @xmath19 for @xmath10 events or @xmath20 for @xmath11 events .",
    "the nucleosynthetic yields in an @xmath10 or @xmath11 event are taken to be constant .    over the galactic history of @xmath21",
    "yr before solar system formation , @xmath22 @xmath10 and @xmath23 @xmath11 events contributed to the solar abundances .",
    "as the @xmath10 events are mainly responsible for the heavy @xmath0-elements such as eu , the eu abundance resulting from a single @xmath10 event must be @xmath24 , where eu / h is the number ratio of eu to hydrogen and @xmath25 is the solar @xmath0-process value ( arlandini et al .",
    "1999 ) . in the spectroscopic notation , @xmath26 . by ignoring possible eu contribution from the @xmath11 events , the eu abundance in a star can be considered as resulting from a number @xmath27 of @xmath10 events : @xmath28 for example , hd 122563 , hd 115444 , and cs 22892 - 052 with [ fe / h ]  @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 have @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , respectively ( westin et al .",
    "2000 ; sneden et al . 2000 ) , corresponding to @xmath35 , 7 , and 35 .",
    "the three stars mentioned above all have [ fe / h ]  @xmath36 but very different @xmath37 values .",
    "in fact , this large dispersion in @xmath37 at [ fe / h ]  @xmath36 has been demonstrated by more extensive observations ( mcwilliam et al .",
    "1995 ; burris et al .",
    "application of equation ( [ eu ] ) to the eu data at [ fe / h ]  @xmath36 led wq to conclude that very little fe can be produced by the @xmath10 events .",
    "it was shown that @xmath38 of the solar fe inventory was provided by snii ( e.g. , timmes , woosley , & weaver 1995 ; qian & wasserburg 2001a ) .",
    "this fe must be assigned to the @xmath23 @xmath11 events that contributed to the solar abundances .",
    "consequently , the fe abundance resulting from a single @xmath11 event must be @xmath39 , corresponding to [ fe / h]@xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , wq concluded that the fe inventory at [ fe / h ]  @xmath36 must be provided by the first very massive stars ( with masses of @xmath41 ) before any snii could have occurred .",
    "these stars may have produced other elements along with fe , thus providing an `` initial '' inventory of metals to the ism .",
    "however , data on ba ( a heavy @xmath0-element ) at @xmath42\\lesssim -3 $ ] ( mcwilliams et al . 1995 ; mcwilliam 1998 ) show that the initial inventory of heavy @xmath0-elements is negligible compared with the contribution from a single @xmath10 event ( wq ) .",
    "therefore , the initial eu inventory can be ignored in equation ( [ eu ] ) for @xmath37 .",
    "the initial inventory of primary concern here is that of fe , hereafter denoted as [ fe / h]@xmath43 . as type ia supernovae ( snia ) contributed fe only at times corresponding to [ fe / h ]  @xmath44 ( e.g. , timmes et al . 1995 ;",
    "qian & wasserburg 2001a ) , the fe abundance in a metal - poor star with @xmath45\\lesssim -1 $ ] can be considered as resulting from a number @xmath46 of @xmath11 events : @xmath47\\approx\\log\\left(10^{[{\\rm fe / h}]_0}+n_{\\cal{l}}\\times 10^{[{\\rm fe / h}]_{\\cal{l}}}\\right).\\ ] ] the range @xmath45\\lesssim -1 $ ] of interest here corresponds to @xmath4830 .",
    "based on the above discussion , the eu and fe abundances in a metal - poor star can be considered as resulting from a mixture of @xmath10 and @xmath11 events . given the average fractions of @xmath10 and @xmath11 events among all snii",
    ", the distribution of @xmath37 expected for metal - poor stars with a given [ fe / h ] can be calculated .",
    "consider the occurrence of snii in an ism with the average fraction of @xmath10 events being @xmath49 .",
    "the probability to have a number @xmath27 of @xmath10 events mixed with a number @xmath46 of @xmath11 events is the same as that for the @xmath50th snii to be the @xmath51th @xmath11 event .",
    "the latter is given by the so - called negative binomial distribution : @xmath52 in particular , @xmath53 .",
    "thus the mixtures of @xmath54 , ( 7,0 ) , and ( 35,0 ) corresponding to the eu and fe abundances in hd 122563 , hd 115444 , and cs 22892 - 052 would occur with probabilities of @xmath55 , 5% , and 0.3% at [ fe / h ]  @xmath36 for @xmath56 .",
    "in general , among all the mixtures with a given @xmath46 the fraction having @xmath57 is @xmath58 consequently , a fraction @xmath59 of all the stars with [ fe / h ] given by equation ( [ fe ] ) for the same @xmath46 as in equation ( [ x ] ) should have @xmath60 .",
    "an `` average '' value of @xmath37 at a given [ fe / h ] can be defined as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the mean value of @xmath27 for a given @xmath46 according to the distribution in equation ( [ bi ] ) .    by taking @xmath63 , [ fe / h]@xmath43 , [ fe / h]@xmath64 , and @xmath56 ,",
    "the contours of @xmath65 are shown in figure 1 as functions of [ fe / h ] for @xmath66 , 10% , 90% , and 99% .",
    "these can be interpreted as the 99% ( solid lines , @xmath66 and 99% ) or 90% ( dashed lines , @xmath67 and 90% ) `` confidence contours '' for eu abundance at a given [ fe / h ] .",
    "if the model presented here is correct , then it should be very unlikely to find stars with values of @xmath37 and [ fe / h ] outside the 99% confidence contours .",
    "the dot - dashed line in figure 1 shows @xmath68 as a function of [ fe / h ] and can be taken as the `` mean '' trend for evolution of eu abundance relative to fe .",
    "the eu data of mcwilliam et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , westin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , sneden et al . ( 2000 ) , and burris et al . ( 2000 ) are also shown in figure 1 .",
    "the data at @xmath45\\lesssim -1.3 $ ] appear to be described quite well by the confidence contours and mean trend calculated from the model , especially when typical observational errors of @xmath690.2 for @xmath37 are taken into account . as the model only considers fe addition from the @xmath11 events to the initial fe inventory , it tends to overestimate @xmath46 [ hence @xmath70 and @xmath65 ] near the onset of snia fe contribution at [ fe / h ]  @xmath72 .",
    "this explains the few data points that are significantly below the contour for @xmath73 at [ fe / h ]  @xmath74 .",
    "these data points are expected to be inside the 99% confidence contours when snia fe contribution is allowed for .",
    "the vertical segments of the contours for @xmath66 and 10% are caused by @xmath75 [ @xmath76 for @xmath77 and 0 , respectively .",
    "these segments will be modified by a refined model that takes into account a small initial eu inventory associated with [ fe / h]@xmath43 and possible eu contribution from the @xmath11 events ( see  4 ) .",
    "as discussed in  2 , the model of diverse snii sources for the @xmath0-process based on the characteristics of @xmath10 and @xmath11 events inferred from meteoritic data provides a good explanation for the observed dispersion and mean trend of eu abundances in metal - poor stars .",
    "there may be other possible models that can achieve the same by separating eu and fe production in a similar way .",
    "however , the model presented here is unique in that its key parameters are inferred from solar system data independent of stellar observations at low metallicities .",
    "furthermore , this model provides a means to discuss @xmath0-abundances in general .",
    "for example , the abundance of ag ( a light @xmath0-element ) in a metal - poor star can be considered as resulting from a mixture of @xmath10 and @xmath11 events in addition to a possible initial ag inventory associated with [ fe / h]@xmath43 .",
    "the numbers @xmath27 and @xmath46 for the mixture can be determined from the observed eu and fe abundances as discussed in  2 .",
    "given the initial ag inventory @xmath78 , the ag abundance resulting from a single @xmath10 event @xmath79 , and that from a single @xmath11 event @xmath80 , the ag abundance in a metal - poor star can be calculated as @xmath81 .",

    "if ag abundances are known for two such stars with different observed eu abundances ( hence different @xmath27 , e.g. , hd 115444 and cs 22892 - 052 ) , then the parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 can be obtained from two equations similar to equation ( [ ag ] ) .",
    "however , so far the ag abundance in only one star with [ fe / h ]  @xmath36 has been published [ @xmath82 for cs 22892 - 052 , sneden et al .",
    "2000 ] . for the discussion to proceed",
    ", it is assumed that the initial ag inventory can be ignored [ @xmath83 . with @xmath84 for cs 22892 - 052",
    "( see  2 ) , @xmath85 is obtained .",
    "as the solar @xmath0-abundance of ag resulted from @xmath22 @xmath10 and @xmath23 @xmath11 events ( see  2 ) , an equation similar to equation ( [ ag ] ) also applies to the sun . the total solar photospheric abundance @xmath86 ( crawford et al . 1998 ) and the solar @xmath87-process abundance ( ag / h)@xmath88 ( arlandini et al .",
    "1999 ) correspond to @xmath89 , which gives @xmath90 ( the ag yield in an @xmath11 event is @xmath91 times higher than that in an @xmath10 event , as expected from the characteristics of these events ) . with the parameters @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 chosen above , the ag abundance in any metal - poor star with observed eu and fe abundances can be calculated by using equations ( [ eu ] ) , ( [ fe ] ) , and ( [ ag ] ) .",
    "crawford et al . ( 1998 ) reported ag abundances or upper limits for 7 stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath92 to @xmath93 , two of which also have observed eu abundances from burris et al .",
    "for these two stars the ag abundances calculated from the above model are in good agreement with the observed values ( see table 1 ; the observational error for @xmath94 is @xmath95 ) .",
    "the model can be further tested by future ag data . as part of the test ,",
    "stars that are predicted to have high ag abundances can be selected first for observation / analysis . for stars with observed ag abundances but no eu data ,",
    "figure 2 shows the dispersion and mean trend of ag abundances over @xmath96}\\lesssim -1 $ ] calculated as in the case of eu ( see  2 ) for @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath56 .",
    "the ag data of crawford et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and sneden et al .",
    "( 2000 ) are also shown in figure 2 . while the available data are fully consistent with the model , extensive ag data for metal - poor stars are needed for a detailed comparison .",
    "the vertical segments of the confidence contours in figure 2 are caused by the assumption of @xmath97 and will be modified when the actual value of @xmath78 is known ( see  4 ) .",
    "the dispersion and mean trends of @xmath0-abundances in metal - poor stars have been discussed based on a model of diverse snii sources for the @xmath0-process .",
    "this model is unique in that its key parameters are inferred from solar system data independent of stellar observations at low metallicities .",
    "it has been shown that this model provides a good explanation for the observed dispersion and mean trend of eu abundances over @xmath2}\\lesssim -1 $ ] .",
    "the calculated confidence contours and mean trend for eu in figure 1 and those for ag in figure 2 represent a good test to distinguish snii from neutron star mergers as the @xmath0-process site . extremely high eu and ag abundances compared with the confidence contours in figures 1 and 2 would be expected for metal - poor stars if neutron star mergers were the @xmath0-process site ( qian 2000 ) .",
    "if the results presented here are borne out by more extensive eu and ag data , then it is quite secure to conclude that snii are the major sources for the @xmath0-process .",
    "furthermore , the model presented here provides a means to discuss @xmath0-abundances in general .",
    "for example , the ag abundance in any metal - poor star with observed eu and fe abundances can be calculated from the model .",
    "this approach has been demonstrated with success for two stars ( table 1 ) and can be further tested by future ag data .",
    "the full approach for a large number of @xmath0-elements will be discussed in a separate paper ( qian & wasserburg 2001b ) .",
    "as emphasized above , the parameters for the model presented here are inferred from solar system data .",
    "in particular , the fraction @xmath49 of @xmath10 events among all snii is estimated from the frequencies of @xmath10 and @xmath11 events suggested by the meteoritic data on @xmath3i and @xmath4hf . while the specific choice of @xmath56 appears to describe the existing observations quite well",
    "[ this is confirmed by the independent work of fields , truran , & cowan ( 2001 ) ] , the actual value of @xmath49 may be obtained from e.g. , an extensive set of eu data at [ fe / h ]  @xmath36 .",
    "stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath36 contain no contributions from the @xmath11 events .",
    "the probability for such stars to have received contributions from a number @xmath27 of @xmath10 events is simply proportional to @xmath100 (  2 ) .",
    "abundances of eu in these stars can be converted into a histogram on the frequency of occurrences for different @xmath27 .",
    "then the value of @xmath49 can be obtained by an exponential fit to the histogram .",
    "it can be seen from figure 1 that the existing eu data at [ fe / h ]  @xmath36 are rather inadequate for this purpose .",
    "future observations in this region of [ fe / h ] are highly desirable .",
    "the initial eu inventory associated with [ fe / h]@xmath43 and possible eu contribution from the @xmath11 events have been ignored .",
    "this gives rises to the vertical segments of the confidence contours in figure 1 .",
    "the actual initial eu inventory may be estimated from the eu abundances at [ fe / h ]  @xmath101 corresponding to the epoch for production by the first very massive stars .",
    "the actual eu production in an @xmath11 event is more complicated to determine .",
    "one possibility is to detect overabundances of @xmath0-elements on the surface of a binary companion to a neutron star ( qian 2000 ) . if the snii producing the neutron star was an @xmath11 event , then large overabundances of light @xmath0-elements such as ag",
    "should be observed .",
    "any associated overabundance of eu , if detected , can be used to estimate the eu production in an @xmath11 event .    the initial ag inventory",

    "the actual value of @xmath78 can be determined when the ag abundance in another star with [ fe / h ]  @xmath36 ( e.g. , hd 115444 ) is known .",
    "the upper limit on the ag abundance in hd 140283 with [ fe / h ]  @xmath102 ( crawford et al . 1998 ) indicates that @xmath103 ( see figure 2 ) . in any case",
