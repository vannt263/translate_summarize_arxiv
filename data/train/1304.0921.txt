    "cp violation plays a crucial role in our understanding of the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau )  @xcite .",
    "this is because the preponderance of matter over antimatter in the observed universe can not be generated from an equal amounts of matter and antimatter unless cp is broken as shown by sakharov ( 1967 ) , who pointed out that in addition to cp violation baryon - number violation , c ( charge - conjugation ) violation , and a departure from thermal equilibrium are all necessary to successfully achieve a net baryon asymmetry in early universe . in the standard model ( sm )",
    "cp symmetry is violated due to a complex phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite . however , since the extent of cp violation in the sm is not enough for achieving the observed bau , we need new source of cp violation for successful bau . on the other hand ,",
    "cp violations in the lepton sector are imperative if the bau could be realized through leptogenesis .",
    "so , any hint or observation of the leptonic cp violation can strengthen our belief in leptogenesis .",
    "the violation of the cp symmetry is a crucial ingredient of any dynamical mechanism which intends to explain both low energy cp violation and the baryon asymmetry .",
    "renormalizable gauge theories are based on the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism , and it is natural to have the spontaneous cp violation ( scpv )  @xcite as an integral part of that mechanism . determining all possible sources of cp violation is a fundamental challenge for high energy physics . in theoretical and economical viewpoints ,",
    "the spontaneous cp breaking necessary to generate the baryon asymmetry and leptonic cp violation at low energies brings us to a common source which comes from the phase of the scalar field responsible for the spontaneous cp breaking at a high energy scale .    under @xmath13",
    ", we propose a simple renormalizable model for the scpv based on @xmath2 flavor symmetry symmetry to avoid the mass degeneracy of @xmath14 and @xmath15 under a @xmath14@xmath15 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "] in a radiative seesaw mechanism  @xcite , which can be guaranteed by an auxiliary @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "the main theoretical challenge for our work is three fold : first , we investigate cp violation in the lepton sector and show how cp phases in pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns )  @xcite can be brought in through spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "second , we show that the model we propose can provide a nice explanation to the smallness of neutrino masses and to the mild hierarchy of neutrino masses .",
    "third , we discuss how to link between leptonic mixing and leptogenesis through the scpv .",
    "cp symmetry is spontaneously broken at high energies , after breaking of @xmath2 flavor symmetry , by a complex vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath2-triplet and gauge singlet scalar filed @xmath16 , which is introduced by heavy neutrino .",
    "the spontaneously generated cp phase could become a natural source of leptogenesis , and bring into low energy cp violation as well in the lepton sector through the cp phases in pmns matrix . due to the auxiliary @xmath1 symmetry",
    ", there are three implications : ( i ) the usual seesaw mechanism does not operate any more , and thus light neutrino masses can not be generated at tree level and can be generated through one loop diagram , thanks to the quartic scalar interactions .",
    "( ii ) the vacuum alignment problem , which arises in the presence of two @xmath2-triplet scalar fields , can be naturally solved by putting the neutral higgs vevs to be zero . and , ( iii )",
    "there can be a natural dark matter candidate which is the @xmath1-odd neutral components of scalar field .",
    "the work we propose is different from the previous works  @xcite in using @xmath2 flavor symmetry , where ( i ) the @xmath2 flavor symmetry is spontaneously broken , and thereby a cp breaking phase is generated spontaneously , and ( ii ) the neutrino yukawa coupling constants do not have all the same magnitude .",
    "our model can naturally explain the measured value of @xmath3 and thereby mild hierarchy of neutrino masses , and can also provide a possibility for low energy cp violation in neutrino oscillations with a renormalizable lagrangian .",
    "the seesaw mechanism , besides explaining of smallness of the measured neutrino masses , has another appealing feature : generating the observed baryon asymmetry in our universe by means of leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "since the conventional @xmath2 models realized with type - i  @xcite or -iii seesaw  @xcite and a tree - level lagrangian lead to an exact tri - bi - maximal ( tbm ) and vanishing leptonic cp - asymmetries responsible for leptogenesis ( due to the proportionality of the @xmath17 combination of the dirac neutrino yukawa matrix @xmath18 to the unit matrix ) , physicists usually introduce soft - breaking terms or higher - dimensional operators with many parameters , in order to explain the non - zero @xmath3 as well as the non - vanishing cp - asymmetries .",
    "our model is based on a renormalizable @xmath19 lagrangian in a radiative seesaw framework with minimal yukawa couplings , and gives rise to a non - degenerate dirac neutrino yukawa matrix and a unique cp - phase which arises spontaneously .",
    "this opens the possibility of explaining the non - zero value of @xmath20 and large deviations from maximality of atmospheric mixing angle @xmath21 , still maintaining large neutrino mixing angle @xmath22 ; furthermore , this allows an economic and dynamical way to achieve low energy cp violation in neutrino oscillations as well as high energy cp violation for leptogenesis .",
    "in addition , auxiliary symmetry guarantees the smallness of neutrino masses and a dark matter candidate , and after the breaking of the @xmath2 flavor symmetry makes their connection under the @xmath23 symmetry flavored .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we lay down the particle content and the field representations under the @xmath23 flavor symmetry with an auxiliary @xmath1 symmetry in our model , as well as construct higgs scalar and yukawa lagrangian . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss how to realize the spontaneous breaking of cp symmetry . in sec .",
    "iv , we consider the phenomenology of neutrino at low energy , and in sec .",
    "v we study numerical analysis . in sec .",
    "vi we show possible leptogenesis and its link with low energy observables we give our conclusions in sec .",
    "vii , and in appendix a we outline the minimization of the scalar potential and the vacuum alignments .",
    "gauge invariance does not restrict the flavor structure of yukawa interactions . as a result ,",
    "particle masses and mixings are generally undetermined and arbitrary in a gauge theory .",
    "we extend the sm by introducing a right - handed majorana neutrinos @xmath24 which are @xmath23 triplet and @xmath25 singlet and two kinds of extra scalar fields , @xmath25 doublet scalars @xmath26 and a @xmath25 singlet scalar @xmath16 , which are @xmath23 triplets .",
    "note that @xmath26 is distinguished from the sm higgs doublet @xmath27 because @xmath27 is @xmath23 singlet .",
    "thus , the scalar fields in this model can be presented as follows ; @xmath28 we impose @xmath2 flavor symmetry for leptons and scalars , and force cp to be invariant at the lagrangian level which implies that all the parameters appearing in the lagrangian are real .",
    "so , the extended higgs sector can spontaneously break cp through a phase in the vev of the singlet scalar field .",
    "in addition to @xmath23 symmetry , we introduce an extra auxiliary @xmath1 symmetry so that : ( i ) a light neutrino mass can be generated via one loop diagram , ( ii ) vacuum alignment problem which occurs in the presence of two @xmath2-triplet can be naturally solved , and ( iii ) there can be a good dark matter candidate .",
