    "this paper examines stimulated raman scattering ( srs ) , or the parametric coupling of a pump light wave ( the laser , mode 0 ) to a daughter light wave ( mode 1 ) and an electron plasma wave ( epw , mode 2 ) .",
    "kinetic effects , such as electron trapping , in the daughter epw are seen to be important in back srs ( bsrs ) .",
    "1-d kinetic simulations presented here show bsrs much greater than coupled - mode theory for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous plasmas .",
    "strong nonlinearity and non - thermal electron distributions are seen to result .",
    "elvis @xcite is a 1-d eulerian vlasov code that evolves the distribution function @xmath1 ( @xmath2 species ; @xmath3 for electrons ) on a fixed phase - space grid .",
    "it uses operator splitting for the time advance @xcite , @xcite and cubic spline interpolation for shifting @xmath1 in position ( @xmath4 ) and momentum ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "light waves are linearly polarized in @xmath6 .",
    "the ions can be immobile or kinetic .",

    "we use a large @xmath13 ( @xmath14 = @xmath15 ) at the edges of the finite density profile to absorb plasma waves generated by srs and prevent reflection . a nonzero central value of @xmath16 can also mimic sideloss from a laser speckle .",
    "we advance @xmath17 without dispersion by shifts of one @xmath4 gridpoint , which imposes @xmath18 .",
    "we simulate a pump laser with @xmath19 nm ( vacuum ) and intensity @xmath20 = @xmath21 w/@xmath22 impinging from the left ( @xmath23 contains the pump ) on a finite plasma with a flat central region 75.1 @xmath24 m wide of density @xmath25 ( critical density @xmath26 = @xmath27 ) and temperature @xmath28 kev . since vlasov codes are low - noise there are no numerical fluctuations for srs to grow from .",
    "we therefore inject a counter - propagating seed light wave via @xmath29 with @xmath30 nm and @xmath31 = @xmath32 .",
    "this light has the maximum linear bsrs growth rate and couples to an epw with @xmath33 = @xmath34 and a landau damping rate @xmath35 ( @xmath36 = @xmath37 , @xmath38 = @xmath39 ) .",
    "the @xmath4 grid spacing is @xmath40 nm , our algorithm requires @xmath41 , and we use a @xmath5 grid spacing @xmath42 .",
    "srs is convective for these parameters with a spatial gain rate @xmath43 @xmath24m@xmath44 , giving a linear reflectivity @xmath45 = @xmath46 .",

    "almost all the energy is contained in bsrs .",
    "@xmath51 is the seed light frequency .",
    "initially bsrs occurs at @xmath52 but upshifts for @xmath53 2 ps , corresponding to a downshift in @xmath54 .",
    "the weak signal near @xmath55 labeled `` fre '' is the forward raman re - scatter of upshifted bsrs light . the longitudinal @xmath56 spectrum in fig .",
    "2(a ) reveals the plasma wave at the matching @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "re - scatter is only possible due to the upshift in @xmath59 , since @xmath55 @xmath60 @xmath61 .",
    "the features slightly below @xmath62 and slightly above @xmath63 , labeled `` seas ? '' , may be related to scattering off the acoustic longitudinal activity discussed below @xcite .",
    "the transmitted light ( @xmath23 ) spectrum ( not presented here ) shows for @xmath533 ps weak levels of both fsrs and the anti - stokes line ( @xmath64 ) of the pump , even though neither of these is externally seeded .",

    "2(a ) , reveals that the bsrs plasma - wave activity is downshifted in frequency from the linear dispersion curve .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the frequency downshift due to electron trapping @xcite , and periods of larger downshift correspond to larger epw amplitude .",
    "the downshifted epw connects with an acoustic - like feature ( @xmath0 ) that extends to @xmath67 .",
    "there is another , lower phase velocity acoustic streak , strongest for @xmath68 .",
    "weak scattering off them may account for the `` seas ? ''",
    "features in fig .",
    "in addition , plasma waves corresponding to fsrs and re - scatter of bsrs occur on the epw dispersion curve .",
    "2(b ) presents the @xmath69 and @xmath4 rms - averaged @xmath65 , which shows the epws occur as a series of wide pulses that move parallel to the laser ( that is , to the right ) .",
    "the group velocity matches the slope of the bsrs plasma waves . near the left edge",
    "some pulses propagate opposite the laser .    the electron distribution @xmath70 forms phase - space vortices at the epw phase velocity @xmath71 ( = 0.264@xmath72 for the linear epw ) .",
    "the space - averaged @xmath73 , displayed in fig .",
    "3(a ) , is flattened due to trapping in this region .",
    "landau damping ( @xmath74 ) is greatly reduced by flattening , which may thereby enhance the reflectivity @xcite .",
    "when the epw amplitude is large @xmath70 is quite flat , and only for brief periods ( @xmath75 ps ) do we see a small bump ( region of @xmath76 ) form slightly above @xmath77 .",
    "the run was repeated with kinetic helium ions ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 ev ) and yielded the dotted @xmath47 in fig .",
    "early in time @xmath47 is the same for immobile and kinetic ions , while later in time they diverge . for the last 2 ps",
    "the reflectivity is very low with kinetic ions .",
    "we do not see evidence of langmuir decay instability ( epw @xmath80 epw + iaw ( ion acoustic wave ) ) of the epw or stimulated brillouin scattering ( photon @xmath80 photon + iaw ) of the pump .",
    "instead , very high @xmath56 activity develops on the left edge of the box around @xmath81 ps , involving large ion density fluctuations ; bsrs is minimal after this .",
    "most of the spectral power in this activity is concentrated in the fsrs and re - scatter of bsrs features .",
    "further study of the role of ions is underway .     over central 5.62 @xmath24 m of box for homogeneous , immobile ions run .",
    "( b ) average reflectivity for inhomogeneous runs with @xmath82 = ( 167 , 250 , 500 ) @xmath24 m .",

    "the detuning limits the interaction .",
    "we performed elvis simulations for the same parameters as the homogeneous run with kinetic ions discussed above .",
    "however , the central region of the density profile now has a linear gradient extending for 100 @xmath24 m .",
    "we vary the endpoint densities and thereby change the density scale length @xmath84 .",
    "the reflectivities for several @xmath82 are shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) , for the pump propagating toward higher and lower densities . also plotted is the steady - state @xmath47 predicted from the coupled - mode equations , solved in the limit of strong damping for the epw ( solid curve ) as well as the rosenbluth undamped result ( dashed curve ) .",
    "both coupled - mode calculations give the same @xmath47 for both directions of pump propagation , yet the simulation consistently shows higher @xmath47 for @xmath85 .",
    "we are formulating a theory to explain the high @xmath47 and the role of pump propagation direction .",

    "the resulting plasma waves do not satisfy the linear dispersion relation .",
