    "<S> in the hindered magnetic dipole transitions of heavy quarkonia , the coupled - channel effects originating from the coupling of quarkonia to a pair of heavy and anti - heavy mesons can play a dominant role . here , we study the hindered magnetic dipole transitions between two @xmath0-wave bottomonia , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with @xmath3 . in these processes the coupled - channel effects are expected to lead to partial widths much larger than the quark model predictions . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate these partial widths which , however , are very sensitive to unknown coupling constants related to the vertices @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> . a measurement of the hindered m1 transitions can shed light on the coupled - channel dynamics in these transitions and hence on the size of the coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> we also suggest to check the coupled - channel effects by comparing results from quenched and fully dynamical lattice qcd calculations .    in recent years , several new bottomonia were discovered . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most interesting discoveries is the @xmath5 found in the puzzling @xmath6 transition @xmath7 with a subsequent electric dipole ( e1 ) transition to the @xmath8 by the babar collaboration  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this finding is consistent with the prediction that such a transition is a promising way to produce the @xmath9  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the isospin violating decay channel has the same final states , @xmath10 , as the one in the electromagnetic cascades @xmath11 and @xmath12 . the branching fractions for the e1 transitions @xmath13 are well measured to be of the order of 10% , but no experimental result for the hindered magnetic dipole ( m1 ) transition @xmath14 is available . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is important to investigate the decay channel @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath16 later on was also observed in the isospin conserving decay process @xmath17  @xcite with a branching fraction @xmath18 , consistent with the estimate of the order @xmath19 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where this channel was suggested to be used to search for the @xmath9 .    </S>",
    "<S> the quark model has been used to study the spectrum and decay properties of the excited bottomonia without the coupled - channel effects from intermediate open - bottom mesons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum was also calculated with the inclusion of coupled - channel effects  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , we remark that coupled - channel effects due the virtual hadronic loops are of recent interest in heavy quarkonium physics . in the quenched quark model , the mixture between the bare hadron states and the two - meson continuum is not taken into account . when the coupled - channel effects are considered , the quarkonium spectrum gets shifted  ( the values of these mass shifts depend on the specific models , see , e.g. , refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the impact on the mass spectrum , the coupled - channel effects are expected to be important in some transitions between heavy quarkonia  @xcite . in particular , they are expected to dominate the hindered m1 transitions between the @xmath0-wave quarkonia because of two reasons : first , the hindered m1 transitions break heavy quark spin symmetry and their widths in the quark model come from relativistic corrections ; second , the coupled - channel contribution has an enhancement due to the @xmath20-wave couplings of the two vertices involving heavy quarkonia  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the partial width of @xmath21 from the coupled - channel effects is two orders of magnitude larger than the prediction from the quark model as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such hindered m1 transitions between bottomonia may be measured at belle - ii  @xcite . however , although there have been calculations on hindered m1 transitions between @xmath20-wave heavy quarkonia in the framework of effective field theory  @xcite and lattice qcd  @xcite , so far only a few predictions on similar transitions between @xmath0-wave bottomonia have been given , and all of them are based on quark model calculations  @xcite . since in bottomonium systems the relativistic corrections are small , the quark model predictions on these partial widths are tiny , in the range from sub - ev to ev . yet , </S>",
    "<S> similar to the charmonia case , the coupled - channel effects due to virtual bottom mesons could enhance the decay widths to values that make an observation possible . </S>",
    "<S> this motivates us to study here the hindered m1 transitions between @xmath0-wave bottomonia by considering the coupled - channel effects through coupling to virtual bottom and anti - bottom mesons . </S>",
    "<S> an additional important motivation for us to study these processes is the fact that experimentalists plan to study them at the coming belle - ii experiment  @xcite .    due to the fact that the bottomonia are close to the open bottom thresholds so that the intermediate bottom mesons </S>",
    "<S> are nonrelativistic , we use nonrelativistic effective field theory ( nreft ) suitable for investigating such coupled - channel effects in heavy quarkonia transitions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the intermediate mesons are nonrelativistic so that their velocities , denoted by @xmath22 , are much smaller than one , and the loop diagrams scale in powers of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the three - momentum and kinetic energy are counted as @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , and each of the nonrelativistic propagators scales as @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> further , a @xmath0-wave bottomonium couples to a pair of ground state bottom and anti - bottom mesons in an @xmath20-wave . at leading order , the coupling is described by a constant which does not contribute any power to the velocity counting . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the triangle diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : loopdiagram ] scales as  @xcite @xmath25 where the factors @xmath26 and @xmath27 are due to the spin - flip of the heavy quark in m1 transitions and the @xmath0-wave coupling of the photon to the bottom mesons , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> one thus sees that the closer the bottomnia to the bottom - meson thresholds , the larger the coupled - channel effects . </S>",
    "<S> one remark is in order : @xmath22 in the power counting is in fact the average of two velocities . </S>",
    "<S> this can be estimated as @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 are the masses of intermediate mesons as labelled in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : loopdiagram ] , @xmath32 is the mass for the initial ( final ) bottomonium , and @xmath33 is the averaged value of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .         and the dashed lines represent the exchanged pions.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    however , unlike the case of charmonium hindered m1 transitions , the two - loop diagrams with a pion exchanged between two intermediate bottom mesons are not highly suppressed for the bottomonium transitions . from the power counting analysis in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the relative importance of the two - loop diagrams shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2loop ] in comparison with the triangle diagram given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : loopdiagram ] can be described by a factor @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the bottom meson mass , @xmath38 , with @xmath39 the pion decay constant , is the chiral symmetry breaking scale , and @xmath40 is the axial coupling constant for bottom mesons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this ratio can be understood as follows ( taking the left diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2loop ] as an example ) : the two more propagators and one more nonrelativistic loop integral measure , in comparison with the diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : loopdiagram ] , together give the factor @xmath41 in the above equation ; @xmath42 comes from the two pionic vertices and one more loop ; @xmath43 is introduced to make the ratio dimensionless . </S>",
    "<S> taking the masses of the @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 bottomonia from refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the velocity in the power counting may be estimated to be 0.31 , 0.23 and 0.18 for the @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 radiative transitions , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> one then finds that the relative factor given in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> is of order one , which means that the contribution of two - loop diagrams like the ones shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2loop ] should be of similar size as the one - loop triangle diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : loopdiagram ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is different from the charmonium case studied in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where @xmath43 is replaced by the much smaller @xmath50 and thus leads to a suppression . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we will only calculate the triangle diagram , and keep in mind that given the power counting of the two - loop diagrams such a calculation can only be regarded as an estimate , rather than a precise calculation , with a quantitative uncertainty analysis out of reach .    as a result of the approximate heavy quark spin symmetry </S>",
    "<S> , one can classify the heavy - light bottom mesons according to the total angular momentum of the light degrees of freedom @xmath51 and collect them in doublets with total spin @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the pseudoscalar ( @xmath53 ) and vector ( @xmath54 ) bottom mesons are collected in the spin multiplet with @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the two - component effective fields  @xcite that describe the ground state heavy mesons in the heavy quark limit are @xmath56 for annihilating bottom mesons and @xmath57 for annihilating anti - bottom mesons , where @xmath58 are the pauli matrices and @xmath59 is the light flavor index . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the @xmath0-wave bottomonia can be collected in a spin multiplet as @xmath60    as mentioned above , the leading order coupling of the @xmath0-wave bottomonium to the bottom and anti - bottom mesons is in an @xmath20-wave , and thus is given by  @xcite @xmath61+h.c.,\\ ] ] where @xmath62 denotes the trace in the spinor space . </S>",
    "<S> we also need the magnetic coupling of the photon to the @xmath20-wave heavy mesons  @xcite @xmath63 + \\frac{e\\ , q'}{2m_q } { \\textrm{tr}}\\left [ h_a^\\dag \\,\\vec{\\sigma}\\cdot \\vec{b } \\ , h_a^{}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the magnetic field , @xmath65 is the light quark electric charge matrix , @xmath66 is the heavy quark electric charge ( for a bottom quark , @xmath67 ) , and @xmath68 is the mass of the heavy quark .    </S>",
    "<S> [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the unknown parameters will get cancelled if we calculate ratios of the decay widths which are proportional to the same product squared of coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we also expect that these ratios are less sensitive to the two - loop diagrams in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2loop ] as the numerator and denominator in the ratio , being related to each other via spin symmetry , would get a similar correction . </S>",
    "<S> the ratios in our calculation can be easily obtained from table  [ tab : widths1 ] . in order to show that the coupled - channel effects lead to very different values for some of these ratios , we show a comparison of ratios for selected decay widths of the hindered m1 transitions between the @xmath45 to @xmath44 bottomonia with those obtained in the quenched quark model of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in table  [ tab : widthsratio ] . </S>",
    "<S> these predictions can be tested in the future from experiments or lattice qcd calculations . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , radiative transitions of @xmath20-wave bottomonia , including the hindered m1 ones , have been studied by using lattice qcd  @xcite . as suggested in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , one can check the coupled - channel effects directly in lattice qcd by comparing results in full and quenched calculations  the former includes the coupled - channel effects intrinsically while the latter does not .    as mentioned in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the numerical results of these hindered transitions in the quark model are very sensitive to relativistic corrections ( these transitions do not vanish only when relativistic corrections are accounted for in quenched quark model ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , they are tiny because the m1 transitions break heavy quark spin symmetry as well , and are in the ballpark of sub - ev to ev in ref .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the partial widths really take such small values , an experimental observation of the bottomonium hindered m1 transitions would be impossible in the foreseeable future . in turn </S>",
    "<S> , this means that once such transitions are observed , the mechanism would be different from that in the quenched quark model , and would be caused by coupled - channel effects . </S>",
    "<S> then , the measured partial widths can be used to estimate the involved coupling constants .    unfortunately , the values of the coupling constants @xmath69 and @xmath70 can not be estimated reliably . if one takes the model estimate made in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> this value is so large that if the @xmath75 is located only 1  mev above the @xmath76 threshold it would have a huge width of 21  gev . </S>",
    "<S> however , the quark model predictions for the open - bottom partial decay widths of the @xmath77 bottomonia leads to @xmath78  gev@xmath74 ( the one for the @xmath79 states is slightly smaller ) , which , although it is for the @xmath77 states , is two orders of magnitude smaller than that from the former estimate . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the product of the coupling constants @xmath80 is estimated to be of order @xmath81 in the charm sector , where the difference between the model estimate for @xmath82  @xcite and the extracted value from quark model predictions of the @xmath45 charmonium decay widths is much smaller . if we naively take the same estimate here , despite that there is no simple flavor symmetry between charmonia and bottomonia , then the partial decay widths of @xmath83  kev could be large enough for a possible measurement in the future .    in principle </S>",
    "<S> , we can also calculate the decay widths for the isospin breaking transitions between the @xmath84 states with the emission of one pion . </S>",
    "<S> they would be proportional to the same combination of unknown coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> the charmonium analogues from the coupled - channel effects have been analyzed in details in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we refrain from such a calculation because the isospin breaking between the charged and neutral bottom mesons is one order of magnitude smaller than that in the charmed sector because of the destructive interference between the contributions from the up and down quark mass difference and the electromagnetic effect  @xcite .    in summary , we studied the hindered m1 transitions between two @xmath0-wave bottomonia , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) assuming the mechanism is dominated by coupled - channel effects . </S>",
    "<S> because of the suppression from heavy quark spin breaking and small relativistic corrections , such transitions have tiny partial widths from sub - ev to ev in quark model . in the mechanism </S>",
    "<S> underlying coupled - channel effects , the breaking of heavy quark spin symmetry can come from the different masses of bottom mesons within the same spin multiplet , and the problem of tiny matrix elements for transitions between bottomonia of different principal quantum numbers in the quark model does not exist as well . therefore , it is natural to expect that the coupled - channel effects lead to much larger widths for such transitions than those predicted in the quark model . a future observation of such transitions at , e.g. </S>",
    "<S> , belle - ii  @xcite may be regarded as a clear signal of the coupled - channel effects , and the measured widths could then be used to extract a rough value of the product of the so - far unknown coupling constants , e.g. @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> such information would be useful for other transitions where intermediate bottom mesons play an important role , such as the decays of the @xmath86 and @xmath87 into @xmath88 and @xmath89 .    at last , we want to emphasize again that the coupled - channel effects in heavy quarkonium transitions can be checked directly in lattice qcd by comparing results from quenched and fully dynamical simulations as we already suggested in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> . a better understanding of coupled - channel effects would lead to new insights into the dynamics of heavy quarkonia . </S>"
