    "<S> ( i ) what does the enormously large entropy of a black hole signify ? ( ii ) how can information emerge from the hole ? in this essay </S>",
    "<S> we will show how understanding the first of these puzzles also resolves the second .    </S>",
    "<S> many physicists had a nagging feeling that hawking s argument for information loss @xcite was flawed : subtle corrections could somehow encode information in the outgoing radiation . </S>",
    "<S> we now know , however , that the hawking argument is stable to all small corrections ; using strong subadditivity of entanglement entropy we can show that information _ will _ be lost unless physics at the horizon is altered by _ order unity _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , string theory supports a plethora of solutions that look like black holes beyond the radius of a would - be horizon , but which are in fact horizon free . </S>",
    "<S> they exist because of the emergence of a new topological structure : a compact direction in the geometry pinches off , ending the spacetime smoothly just outside the location where the horizon would have appeared ( fig.[fone]a ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these ` fuzzball ' states , which have no horizon , are expected to agree in count with @xmath4 $ ] , where @xmath5 is the bekenstein entropy . </S>",
    "<S> their structure is reminiscent of the ` bubble of nothing ' @xcite where a region of spacetime is removed and the pinching of a compact circle at the boundary of this region yields a geodesically complete manifold ( fig.[fone]b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> if black hole microstates have no horizon , then we do not have hawking s pair creation process , and thus no information loss ; the fuzzball radiates from its surface ( at the hawking rate @xcite ) just like a star . </S>",
    "<S> but one may ask : if we start with a collapsing shell of mass @xmath6 , then ca nt we just trust the classical approximation where the shell collapses through @xmath7 to create a horizon ? </S>",
    "<S> if such a horizon is indeed created , then light cones inside the horizon point towards smaller @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> thus causality would forbid any effects that happen at @xmath9 from altering the vacuum state at @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> it would then appear that we can never get to a fuzzball state at the horizon , so how have we resolved the information paradox ?    to see the way around this conundrum first consider a toy model , where we assume that the theory contains a very large number @xmath10 of massless scalar fields @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> if n ( mm_p)^2 [ one ] then the collapsing shell will not make a black hole . </S>",
    "<S> particle creation in curved space starts before the shell reaches its horizon . </S>",
    "<S> for each species @xmath11 we have @xmath12 quanta radiated while the shell collapses from , say , @xmath13 to @xmath14 m. each quantum has wavelength @xmath15 ( the only length scale in the problem ) , so if the shell indeed reached down to @xmath16 , then the total mass radiated in all the fields @xmath11 would be m_rad~ngm m [ twop ] where in the last step we have used ( [ one ] ) and noted that @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the shell radiates away before reaching the vicinity of @xmath7 .    in string theory </S>",
    "<S> we do not have a large number of massless fields , but we do have a large number of _ massive _ fuzzball states . </S>",
    "<S> we call these states @xmath18 ; each has mass @xmath6 , and the number of such states is @xmath4 $ ] . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> it was argued that a collapsing shell can tunnel into any given @xmath18 at a very small rate @xmath19 $ ] , where @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> but the number of states @xmath18 we can transition to is @xmath4 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> so the overall rate of transitioning to fuzzballs is ~n_fuzzballs exp[-s_bek]~exp[s_bek]exp[-s_bek ] [ two ] if @xmath21 , then we transition to fuzzballs quickly , and thus never make a horizon . </S>",
    "<S> this would remove the information paradox .     </S>",
    "<S> signs ) , and fluxes between the monopoles ( shaded ovals ) support the structure . </S>",
    "<S> the region which would have been the interior of the horizon is absent . </S>",
    "<S> different choices of fluxes and @xmath22 signs at different angular positions give the @xmath4 $ ] horizonless states of the hole . ]    unfortunately , while one could estimate that @xmath20 , there was no immediate way to show that @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> we now close this loophole by using an old result to argue that in fact @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us begin by recalling hawking s radiation rate for quanta of energy @xmath24 ~e^-t~e^-8gm in @xcite this expression was modified to include backreaction . for radiation of a spherical shell of _ any _ energy @xmath25 , we get ~e^-8 g ( m-2 ) this is a special case of a general expression valid for all holes in all dimensions @xcite ~e^s_bek(m-)-s_bek(m)e^-s_bek    we are interested in the case where the entire mass @xmath6 in the shell transitions to a fuzzball state @xmath18 of energy @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath27 in this case , and e^-s_bek~e^s_bek(m-)-s_bek(m)~e^-s_bek(m ) thus we see that for any one species @xmath18 we get ~e^-s_bek(m ) giving = 1 [ ten ] equation ( [ ten ] ) is the main result of this article . </S>",
    "<S> the rate at which the geometry tunnels to fuzzballs is small ( as expected ) , but we see ( eq.([two ] ) ) that this smallness is _ exactly _ cancelled by the largeness of the bekenstein entropy , which governs how many final states we can tunnel to . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore have the picture depicted in fig.[fsixdel ] : as the shell approaches the horizon ( in the schwarzschild frame ) , its state transitions to a linear combination of fuzzball states @xmath18 , at such a rate that there is no amplitude left in the shell state itself by the time the shell reaches @xmath7 . thus the classical approximation is completely violated , and no horizon forms . </S>",
    "<S> this resolves the information paradox .        to extract the moral of this story , consider again the toy model which gives ( [ twop ] ) </S>",
    "<S> we can imagine that the collapsing shell is made of gravitons . </S>",
    "<S> if we consider only classical physics for all fields , then the scalars @xmath11 would never be involved ; the shell would pass through its horizon to create a black hole . </S>",
    "<S> what prevents horizon formation is the change in the quantum vacuum state of the @xmath11 caused by the mass @xmath6 in the shell ; this change of vacuum leads to pair production . </S>",
    "<S> the largeness of @xmath10 ( eq . ( [ one ] ) ) makes the virtual fluctuations of the @xmath11 sufficiently important to modify the classical evolution of the shell completely .    with fuzzballs , </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational theory has a large number @xmath28 $ ] of states @xmath18 of mass @xmath6 . in the minkowski vacuum </S>",
    "<S> , we do not have the energy to create these states on - shell . </S>",
    "<S> but we should not ignore the vacuum fluctuations into this very large set of states . </S>",
    "<S> the infalling shell alters these vacuum fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of the shell gets converted to on - shell states @xmath18 , and the classical motion of the shell is completely invalidated .    </S>",
    "<S> put another way , we should always consider the wavefunctional of gravity on the _ whole _ of superspace , the space of all spatial geometries . </S>",
    "<S> suppose we write the superspace wavefunctional @xmath0 $ ] of the collapsing shell in the wkb approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the wavefunctional would be oscillatory on some part of superspace  the classically allowed region  but will be exponentially damped ( ` under the barrier ' ) in the rest of superspace . </S>",
    "<S> classical physics focuses on the oscillatory part , but we will now show by a toy model that the ` under the barrier ' part of the wavefunction can become very important when there are a large number of degrees of freedom .    consider the quantum mechanical problem of a particle in the 1-dimensional potential @xmath29 depicted in fig.[ffour](a ) . </S>",

    "<S> suppose that the wavefunction leaks out to infinity at a slow rate _ </S>",
    "<S> x=0^a dx |(x , t)|^2 ( 1- ) e^-t ,  1 but for the case of @xmath34 dimensions , the norm in the central well ( _ x_1=0^a dx_1 |(x_1 , t)|^2 ) ( _ x_2=0^a dx_2 |(x_2 , t)|^2 )  </S>",
    "<S> ( _ x_n=0^a dx_n |(x_n , t)|^2 ) ( 1-)^n e^-nt decays almost instantly , in a time t ~1/(n)1    let us summarize . </S>",
    "<S> it was known that black holes are characterized by a remarkably large entropy @xmath5 , but we did not know what this largeness signified for the dynamics of the hole . </S>",
    "<S> with the advent of the fuzzball construction it is now conjectured that @xmath4 $ ] counts explicitly constructable states  </S>",
    "<S> fuzzballs  which are normal quantum gravitational states without horizon . under normal conditions ( </S>",
    "<S> i.e. when we are not close to making a black hole ) these states lie in the regime of superspace where the wavefunction is ` under the barrier ' , so we do not directly see these states . </S>",
    "<S> but as a collapsing shell approaches its horizon , the wavefunctional tunnels into the ensemble of these states at rate that is _ not _ suppressed ; the smallness of tunneling rate to each fuzzball is exactly cancelled by the largeness of the number of fuzzballs . </S>",
    "<S> the norm of the wavefunction captured by these fuzzball states thus grows to unity , just as in the toy example of a particle in an @xmath10 dimensional potential well with @xmath10 large . </S>",
    "<S> this tunneling alters the classical dynamics of a collapsing shell completely and resolves the information paradox , since the fuzzballs that result have no horizon .    </S>",
    "<S> it is now interesting to ask how this altered dynamics should be described ; in particular we have a tantalizing conjecture of fuzzball complementarity @xcite which says that collective oscillations of the fuzzball surface approximately mimic , in a _ dual _ description , the dynamics of the black hole interior . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation allows information to escape in low energy @xmath35 quanta of hawing radiation , while dynamics of @xmath36 quanta mimics classical physics in the dual picture .    , and a barrier starting at @xmath37 . </S>",
