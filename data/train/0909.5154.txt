    "@xcite found that this source is actually two stars ( o05a / o05b ) with similar temperatures and luminosities ( @xmath118  k , @xmath119 ) , which are totally unresolved in both _ spitzer _ and _ akari _ data .",
    "both stars appear oxygen - rich and show blue - shifted h@xmath9 absorption cores that indicate an outflow of material .",
    "it is unclear how their small separation ( 0.2 ) has affected the ir photometry .",
    "it is possible that the low resolution of the _ akari _ images has resulted in blending of sources in addition to o05a and o05b , causing inflated _ akari _ fluxes .",
    "another possibility is that one or both of these sources is variable , producing different types of dust in varying proportions during different phases of the pulsation cycle .",
    "a third possibility is that neither star has a real ir excess , and the apparent excess is caused by inaccurate flux extraction due to stellar blending in this crowded region of the cluster .",
    "however , this third possibility seems unlikely since s05 also shows a strong 24   excess ( fig .",
    "[ fig : seds_strong ] ) , suggesting that at least one of the stars is producing dust .",
    "nevertheless , the h@xmath9 line clearly shows that both stars ( o05a / o05b ) are losing mass , although it may not be as clear that the mass loss in either star is accompanied by dust production .",
    "for source s07 , _ akari _ photometry is available only at 24  , and this flux is more than twice the flux measured with mips at 24  . if the _ akari _ 24",
    "flux is accurate , it can only be explained by an extremely large quantity of circumstellar dust .",
    "this , along with the source s location near several other bright 24   sources , suggests that the _ akari _ 24   flux is overestimated .",
    "we therefore exclude the _ akari _ 24   point from the dusty fit and find that silicate dust provides the best fit due to the lack of strong excess in the irac data .",
    "the two remaining extreme sources , s02 ( v2 ) and s06 ( v16/o01 ) , are the most extreme stars in the cluster and exhibit the strongest mass - loss rates . neither star is fit well by silicates alone , but both are well fit by amc models .",
    "this is surprising , given that the optical spectrum of s06 indicates c / o @xmath120 1 @xcite .",
    "@xcite did not measure the carbon abundance in star s02 , so its nature as carbon or oxygen - rich remains unknown .",
    "carbon stars _ are _ known to reside in gcs , notably in @xmath3cen @xcite .",
    "models that include a combination of 50% amc dust and 50% silicate dust also fit well to both s06 and s02 , but we note that to fit this model to s02 , we must exclude the _ akari _ photometry , which shows no silicate features .    a mid - ir spectrum of s02 was obtained by y.  ita et al .",
    "( in preparation ) using _ akari _ irc slit - less spectroscopy .",
    "pre - analysis of the spectrum suggests a complete lack of silicates and the possible presence co and water absorption near 3 and 5  , which may explain the underluminous _ akari _ photometry near these wavelengths . while we can not definitively declare a dust type in either s02 or s06 , amc dust must play some role if we are to reconcile the strong photometric excess in the irac bands and the excess at 24  .",
    "the uncertainties quoted for the total mass - loss rates of the candidate mass - losing stars reflect a range of values that depends on the dust composition chosen . the uncertainties in the mass - loss rates for individual stars",
    "is not reflected in this value . in @xmath3cen , uncertainties of 52  80% were derived for the mass - loss rates of individual stars , based on internal errors from dusty and on several assumptions .",
    "these assumptions include ( 1 ) pulsation causes only negligible variations in the mid - ir , ( 2 ) the gas - to - dust ratio scales with metallicity , ( 3 ) the wind velocity scales as @xmath121 , and ( 4 ) dust - to - gas coupling is efficient .",
    "see @xcite for a more detailed discussion of mass - loss rate uncertainties .",
    "we note that the prescription we use to estimate the mass - loss rates assumes that the wind speed scales as @xmath122 , resulting in velocities ranging from @xmath123 for mass - loss candidates in ngc  362 .",
    "these small velocities provide the largest uncertainty to our mass - loss rates , as they are on the order of the turbulence in the wind ( @xmath50@xmath124 ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is not clear whether very slow winds can be sustained , but it is possible that wind speeds can be increased to @xmath125@xmath126 due to the effects of rotation and pulsation in the star .",
    "moreover , @xcite estimated that the wind velocities in several ngc  362 stars range from @xmath34@xmath127",
    ". if these velocities are good approximations of the wind speed in the dust - producing zone , then the mass - loss rates of each star will increase by up to a factor 6 .",
    "star s06 ( v16 ) appears to show carbon dust despite its nature as an oxygen - rich star .",

    "while @xmath3cen v42 and ngc  362 v16 both appear to be currently dominated by carbonaceous dust , they may still contain some ( possibly variable ) amounts of silicates .",
    "47tuc is home to two dusty stars ( v1 and v18 ) that show variable silicate emission @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest a possible scenario where non - local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions allow the periodic production of different grain compositions at different epochs in the pulsation cycle .",
    "it may also be the case that grain size varies enough that large grains periodically suppress the silicate features .      the cluster stars that exhibit ir excesses are currently returning @xmath128 of gas to the icm , using the same fractional errors used in @xcite . to find the total cluster mass loss ( dusty and dustless )",
    ", we estimate the mass - loss rates for non - dusty stars using the method described in @xcite , which is based on the stellar temperature and luminosity . we find that chromospherically - driven ( dustless ) mass loss is responsible for @xmath129 , giving a total cluster mass loss of @xmath130",
    ". dust production therefore accompanies 80% of the current mass loss in ngc  362 .",

    "47tuc , which is similar in mass to @xmath3cen , appears to have a similar global mass - loss rate , given that its four long - period variables have mass - loss rates ranging from @xmath132 to @xmath133 @xcite . in all three clusters , only a handful of stars",
    "are dominating the global mass - loss rate .",
    "this supports the likelihood that global dust production and dust - associated mass loss in clusters are stochastic in nature , driven by episodic dust production in the individual stars ( possibly due to varying stellar conditions at different pulsation phases ) and the rarity of the stars themselves .",

    "ngc  362 may therefore be representative of a more intermediate phase of dust production in the typical gc .",
