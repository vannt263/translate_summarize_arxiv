    "control of many - particle ensembles is of great importance in diverse physical problems .",
    "a particular example is motion of cold atoms in an optical lattice created by two counter - propagating laser beams .",
    "control of atom dynamics in the laser field @xcite is needed for developing atomic ratchets @xcite , producing registers of quantum computers @xcite , and implementation of various dynamical regimes for atomic motion in optical lattices @xcite , for instance , chaotic walking @xcite",
    ".    it can be desirable to control the state of the atomic ensemble immediately in the course of its evolution . for this purpose",
    ", one can use a weak and tunable slowly - varying perturbation of an optical lattice . on the classical level ,",
    "such a perturbation can cause adiabatic transformation of the phase portrait , thereby driving atoms to the target state .",
    "a similar approach had been already used for producing hamiltonian ratchets @xcite , as well as for cooling and partial localization of the particle ensemble in the vicinity of the minima of the potential @xcite . in the present work",
    "we exploit almost the same idea for controlling quantum transport of atomic wavepackets in an optical lattice . a particular aim",
    "we pursue is wavepacket localization near the minima of the optical potential .",
    "let s consider far - detuned optical lattice created by the laser field of the following form : @xmath0\\right\\},\\ ] ] i.e. the laser field is a sum of the standing and low - amplitude running waves ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the running wave involves the adiabatic phase modulation @xmath2 with @xmath3 . in the rotating - wave approximation , motion of a wavepacket corresponding to a two - level atom",
    "is described by the schrdinger equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is position , @xmath6 is the momentum operator , @xmath7 is the atomic mass , @xmath8 is sdetuning of the atom - field resonance , @xmath9 is the rabi frequency . after the transformation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the recoil frequency , we obtain the following expression for the operator @xmath12 : @xmath13 , \\label{ht}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 . the running wave acts as a small oscillating perturbation whose frequency varies with time as @xmath15 eqs .",
    "( [ norm2 ] ) transform the schrdinger equation into the following form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the effective planck constant . in the present work we consider rb atoms with @xmath18  khz , and the laser field with @xmath19  mhz , @xmath20  ghz .",
    "this yields @xmath21 .",
    "let s firstly consider the classical counterpart of the quantum hamiltonian operator @xmath12 , resulting from the replacement of the operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ ht ] ) by the respective classical quantities .",
    "good correspondence between quantum and classical modelling is expected when the effective planck constant @xmath24 is small compared with some characteristic value of classical action . in our case , a relevant choice of the `` characteristic action '' is the action value on the unperturbed separatrix that divides domains of finite and infinite atomic motion in phase space . in the classical limit , eq .",
    "( [ ht ] ) corresponds to the hamiltonian of nonlinear pendulum , and the respective separatrix action @xmath25 ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite ) is much larger than @xmath26 .",
    "if the condition @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are integers , @xmath30 is the frequency of atom oscillations in the unperturbed optical potential , @xmath31 is atom energy , is fulfilled , there arises classical nonlinear resonance .",
    "let s divide time axis into consecutive intervals @xmath32 $ ] , @xmath33 $ ] , @xmath34 $ ] , ... of length @xmath35 . as @xmath3 ,",
    "variation of the frequency @xmath36 within each interval is negligible , that is , @xmath36 can be treated as a fixed quantity .",
    "then one can replace frequency @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ rescond ] ) by the mean frequency @xmath38 averaged over the interval .",
    "after this replacement , motion in the vicinity of resonance ( [ rescond ] ) can be described using the theory of nonlinear resonance in hamiltonian systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is well known that a particle captured into nonlinear resonance undergoes quasiperiodic oscillations modulated with frequency @xmath39 .",
    "value of @xmath38 weakly changes on each successive time interval , thereby the resonance values of energy @xmath40 slowly change as well .",
    "assume that some nonlinear resonance does nt overlap significantly with other resonances , i.  e. the chirikov s criterion @xcite is not satisfied .",
    "then phase space area occupied by the resonance is an adiabatic invariant . in this case , some fraction of the atomic ensemble , being initially trapped by the resonance , can be retained inside , despite of the resonance displacing .",
    "such behavior is a kind of autoresonance .",
    "thus , it turns out that resonance ( [ rescond ] ) can work as a `` vehicle '' for atoms , transporting them to the desirable energy range .",
    "in numerical simulation , we use the sawtooth adiabatic phase modulation of the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a dimensionless period of modulation , related to its dimensional analogue by means of the formula @xmath43 .",
    "frequency of the perturbation varies as @xmath44 i.e. it grows linearly within each period of modulation . throughout this paper",
    "we shall term periods of adiabatic modulation as adiabatic cycles .",
    "parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 are specified to satisfy the condition ( [ rescond ] ) with @xmath47 , i.  e. the main resonance should occur . also , we demand that the resonance domain in phase space should move from the vicinity of the unperturbed separatrix towards center fixed points ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 is integer ) corresponding to the lowest value of energy .",
    "these requirements are well satisfied with @xmath51 .",
    "also , we take @xmath52 and @xmath53 . according to eq .",
    "( [ norm2 ] ) , this yields @xmath54  mhz and @xmath55  ms .",
    "numerical simulation of the classical atom dynamics had been carried out with the ensemble of @xmath56 atoms .",
    "the initial phase space distribution had been taken in the gaussian form : @xmath57,\\ ] ] where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , i.  e. the ensemble is initially concentrated in the vicinity of the separatrix with a little spread in momentum .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "1 represents phase space distributions of atoms at different time instants . in order to demonstrate the role of nonlinear resonance",

    "@xmath63 is treated as a parameter .",

    "the lower panel of fig .  1 illustrates the poincar sections for the hamiltonian ( [ ht1 ] ) with various @xmath63 .",

    "corresponding values of @xmath63 are indicated above the plots.,scaledwidth=98.0% ]    [ fig1 ]    perturbation leads to emergence of a chaotic layer in the vicinity of the separatrix .",
    "the remainder of phase space corresponds to regular motion .",
    "initially the atomic ensemble almost entirely belongs to the chaotic layer and , therefore , rapidly spreads along the separatrix .",
    "resonance @xmath47 reveals itself as an island occupied by the chaotic sea .",
    "phase space volume corresponding to the island grows with time , that is , atoms can penetrate into the island from outside area @xcite .",
    "this process is accompanied by shrinking of the central domain of stability , as it is demonstrated in the plots corresponding to @xmath64 .",
    "both these tendencies enable atoms to diffuse deeper and deeper into the domain of finite motion .",
    "adiabatic phase modulation makes the resonance moving towards the center fixed point . at some moment",
    ", the resonance reaches the internal boundary of the chaotic layer and falls into the central domain of stability , carrying along the atoms which have penetrated into the island .",
    "it is clearly seen in the plot depicting the atom distribution at @xmath65 , when the resonance has already deepened into the regular domain . as the resonance joins the regular domain , width of the chaotic layer significantly decreases . at the final phase of the modulation the resonance reaches the center of phase space . as a result ,",
    "large fraction of the atomic ensemble becomes localized near the minima of the potential . this sequence of stages results in decreasing of mean atomic energy during the first cycle of the adiabatic modulation , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]    during the subsequent adiabatic cycles , efficiency of autoresonance - assisted localization ceases because atomic ensemble becomes more and more spread in the phase space domain of finite motion .",
    "indeed , the most efficient localization is expected if the initial energy distribution is strongly inhomogeneous , with a peak near the separatrix energy , otherwise the `` moving '' resonance can capture atoms with smaller energies than @xmath66 ( see eq .",
    "[ rescond ] ) . in the latter case capturing into resonance should result in energy growth instead of decreasing . as it is shown in fig .",
    "2 , mean energy decreases until @xmath67 , when resonance ( [ rescond ] ) approaches the center of phase space second time and traps atoms localized during the first adiabatic cycle .",
    "then mean energy starts growing .",
    "ensemble spreading is reflected in the time dependence of energy variance @xmath68 .",
    "during the first adiabatic cycle energy variance rapidly grows because resonance detaches large atomic cloud from the ensemble",
    ". then variance slowly decreases revealing gradual transition to the state with uniform occupation of the accessible phase space area .",
    "an analogous situation had been observed in similar classical models ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "quantum atom dynamics had been examined by solving numerically the schrdinger equation ( [ shrod1 ] ) .",
    "quantum analogue of nonlinear resonance is quantum nonlinear resonance @xcite manifesting itself as enhancement of energy exchange within some group of levels belonging to the same energy range .    in the quantum case , mean",
    "energy and energy variance can be evaluated by means of the expansion @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the @xmath7-th eigenfunction of the unperturbed hamiltonian .",
    "the eigenfunctions are the solutions of the sturm - liouville problem @xmath71 with periodic boundary conditions imposed .",
    "moments of energy distribution are expressed as @xmath72 with the normalization condition @xmath73 .",
    "the initial state had been chosen as a superposition of coherent states @xmath74 } { \\sqrt[4]{2\\pi\\delta^2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath75 , @xmath76 is a gaussian random variable with mean value 2 and variance 0.25 .",
    "( solid ) , @xmath77 ( chain ) and @xmath78 ( dotted).,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    [ fig3 ]    as it follows from fig .  2",
    ", quantum wavepacket undergoes the same sequence of stages as the classical ensemble , and quantum and classical curves have notably the same form .",
    "efficiency of localization can be estimated by means of the cumulative energy distribution @xmath79 where @xmath80 is atom energy distribution , @xmath81 is the minimum of the unperturbed potential .",
    "3 represents cumulative energy distributions at three time instants : initial time , the end of the first adiabatic cycle , and the end of the third adiabatic cycle . at the end of the first adiabatic cycle ,",
    "approximately 28 percents of the overall energy belongs to low energy levels with @xmath82 .",
    "however , at the end of the third adiabatic cycle , wavepacket becomes widespread over the phase space domain of finite motion , and energy distribution becomes almost uniform .",
    "this is reflected in nearly linear growth of @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "to summarize , we have demonstrated a simple scheme allowing one to localize a considerable fraction of an atomic ensemble near the minima of an optical potential .",
    "the scheme is based upon the effect of autoresonance .",
    "we suggest that our method may be used as an intermediate stage of laser cooling .",
    "efficiency of the scheme proposed depends on the two factors .",
    "firstly , atom dynamics should be enough `` semiclassical '' , that is , the effective planck constant @xmath24 should be fairly small .",
    "secondly , the efficiency increases with insreasing period of the adiabatic modulation .",
