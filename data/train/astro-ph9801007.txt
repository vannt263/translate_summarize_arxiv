    "a similar brightening of mrk 501 during 1997 has been observed in x - rays by the rxte all sky monitor ( asm ) , the peak brightness in june 1997 being @xmath16 40 mcrab ( fig .",

    "the tev and asm ( 2 - 10 kev ) light curves show similar flaring activity during 1997 , the correlated x - ray and vhe gamma - ray variability will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .    at the onset of this high activity in april 1997",
    "observations with the sax satellite were carried out ( pian et al .",
    "they find mrk 501 with an unusually hard x - ray spectrum , extending up to photon energies of 100 kev with the hardest spectrum observed on 16 april , when the source was brightest .",
    "the bright x - ray state of mrk 501 in june / july 1997 triggered intense multi - frequency observations from radio to vhe gamma - rays . here",

    "we have used ftools 4.0 for the reduction of the pca and hexte data .",

    "the pca spectra in the pha channel range 3 - 60 ( 2.5 - 27 kev ) and the spectra from both hexte clusters in the channel range 15 - 100 ( 15 - 100 kev ) were combined for each of the 10 pointings and then fitted with single and broken power law spectra . the uncertainty in the absolute flux calibration of the hexte instrument , mainly due to uncorrected dead - time effects ( see rothschild et al .",
    "@xcite ) , was accounted for by allowing for a scaling factor between the pca and hexte spectra . setting pca to 1.0 ,",
    "the mean best fit value for the hexte normalization was 0.65 .",
    "the absorbing column density on the line of sight to mrk 501 was fixed to @xmath19 as derived from the rosat spectrum ( lamer et al .",
    "@xcite ) . this value is larger than the galactic value as derived from @xmath20 h i measurements ( @xmath21 , stark et al .",

    "note that pian et al .",
    "@xcite used the galactic h i column density = @xmath22 for the spectral fits to the sax data and that the uncertainty in the value towards the source may have a significant effect on the spectral indices measured with the lecs instrument at the softest x - ray energies .",
    "single power law models with @xmath23 fixed to any reasonable value do not yield acceptable fits to the data of any pointing , whereas broken power law models with break energies between 5.5 and 6.0 kev give excellent fits to the individual spectra ( see tab .",
    "[ spec ] ) . below the break",
    "point the model spectra are exceptionally hard with energy indices ranging from 0.65 to 0.77 .",
    "in fact an x - ray synchrotron spectrum of this hardness has never been observed in any other xbl ( ciliegi et al .",
    "@xcite , lamer at al .",
    "the spectrum measured on 16 april 1997 by sax in about the same energy band ( 2.14 - 10 kev ) is even slightly harder ( @xmath24 , pian et al .",
    "as the pca has no sensitivity below 2 kev , we are not able to verify the break at @xmath25 in the sax spectrum .    above the break point",
    "the pca spectrum steepens by up to 0.3 in energy index .",
    "in some of the spectra @xmath14 exceeds unity , indicating that the maximum of the synchrotron power output is reached in the hard x - ray range . however , there is no evidence for further steepening of the spectrum up to 100 kev .    during the rxte observations the pca count - rate varied by @xmath4 , but in contrast to the results from the april 1997 sax observations",
    "an anti - correlation of flux and spectral hardness was observed both below and above the spectral break .",
    "such an anti - correlation has never been reported in mrk 501 and is quite unusual for x - ray bl lac objects altogether .",
    "pian et al . found a spectral hardening by @xmath26 in the sax mecs 2 - 10 kev band during an increase of the flux in this energy band by a factor of 2.4 .",
    "the large degree of spectral variability and its anti - correlation with total flux implies great differences between the light curves in the individual x - ray energy bands .",
    "we hence derived light curves for seven and four different channel ranges of the pca and hexte detectors , respectively ( figs .",
    "[ pca_lc ] and [ hexte_lc ] ) .",
    "the light curves in the softer bands show a decline by 20% over 3 days with a well defined minimum at mjd 50643.2 and a subsequent increase by 30% during the following 2 days . on the other hand",
    "the hardest bands are dominated by a feature with a broad maximum around mjd 50642 . a smooth transition with superpositions of both morphologies",
    "is observed in the intermediate energy bands .",
    "the independent variability of soft and hard x - rays requires the existence of at least two emission components which is not evident from the x - ray spectrum alone .",
    "the sharpest feature in the 2 - 20 kev lightcurves is a decrease in flux by 10% within 4.5 hours . in",
    "an exosat me lightcurve ( 0.7 - 8 kev , giommi et al .",

    "bl lac objects giommi et al",
    ". found tight correlations of flux and spectral hardness for any of the objects , including mrk 501 .",
    "this highlights the peculiarity of the spectral variability reported here .",
    "our rxte observations from july 1997 show that the period of increased x - ray brightness continued throughout 1997 and was not limited to a short flare in april .",
    "the object clearly was in a long - lasting high - state in 1997 rather than exhibiting a short , spectacular x - ray flare during the epoch of the sax observations .",
    "we confirm the extraordinary hard x - ray spectrum which extends up to 100 kev .",
    "the peak of the synchrotron emission is observed in the hard x - rays , more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than in earlier observations ( e.g. by rosat in 1991 , lamer et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    during the rxte observations in july the total flux and",
    "the spectral hardness show an anti - correlation .",
    "this is a very unusual spectral behaviour for any bl lac object , it has not been observed previously in mrk 501 and is in marked contrast to the fact that the sax observations of pian et al . showed a flatter spectrum during the brighter stage ( there are only two different brightness and spectral levels in the sax data set rather than a well - established correlation ) .",
    "the flux - spectral index relations should hence not be regarded as universal and viable models should explain both kinds of behaviour .",
    "the broken power law ( or gradual steepening of the spectrum ) is consistent with synchrotron cooling of a single component and does not require the superposition of different particle distributions .",
    "a homogeneous jet and a magnetic field of @xmath27 are capable of producing the integrated spectral signature .",
    "we have found rather dramatic spectral differences in the light curves which can not be explained by a single population but requires the contributions of at least two , if not more spectral components .",
    "this illustrates the great importance of well - sampled monitoring with instruments covering a wide spectral range .",
