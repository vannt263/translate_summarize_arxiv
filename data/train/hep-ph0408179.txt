    "the inclusive , weak radiative decay @xmath1 is the prototype of all flavor - changing neutral current processes . in the standard model ,",
    "this process is mediated by loop diagrams containing @xmath13 bosons and top ( or lighter ) quarks . in extensions of the standard model",
    ", other heavy particles propagating in loops can give sizable contributions , which in many cases can compete with those of the standard model .",
    "as a result , measurements of the @xmath1 rate and cp asymmetry provide sensitive probes for new physics at the tev scale .",
    "in many cases , the fact that these measurements agree with standard model predictions imposes non - trivial constraints on the allowed parameter space .",
    "given the prominent role of @xmath1 decay in searching for physics beyond the standard model , it is of great importance to have a precise prediction for its inclusive rate and cp asymmetry in the standard model .",
    "this has been achieved thanks to the combined effort of many theorists over a period of several years @xcite .",
    "the total inclusive rate is known at next - to - leading order in renormalization - group ( rg ) improved perturbation theory with a theoretical precision of about 10% .",
    "currently , a major effort is underway to improve this accuracy by calculating the dominant parts of the next - to - next - to - leading corrections @xcite .",
    "while the total inclusive @xmath1 decay rate can be calculated using a conventional operator - product expansion ( ope ) based on an expansion in logarithms and inverse powers of the @xmath14-quark mass @xcite , the situation is more complicated when a cut on the photon energy is applied . in practice",
    ", experiments can only measure the high - energy part of the photon spectrum , @xmath2 , where typically @xmath15gev ( measured in the @xmath0-meson rest frame ) or slightly lower @xcite .",
    "even if such a cut was not required for experimental reasons , it would be needed to reduce the photon background from @xmath16 decays followed by a radiative decay of the @xmath17 @xcite . with @xmath18",
    "restricted to be close to the kinematic endpoint at @xmath19 ( neglecting the kaon mass ) , the hadronic final state @xmath20 is constrained to have large energy @xmath21 but only moderate invariant mass @xmath22 . in this kinematic region ,",
    "important hadronic effects need to be taken into account .",
    "an infinite set of leading - twist terms in the ope need to be resummed into a non - perturbative shape function , which describes the momentum distribution of the @xmath14-quark inside the @xmath0 meson @xcite .",
    "in addition , sudakov double logarithms arise near the endpoint of the photon spectrum , which need to be resummed to all orders in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "while these issues are now well understood theoretically @xcite , the presence of the shape function leads to an unavoidable element of hadronic uncertainty and modeling , which is undesirable when the goal is to probe for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "conventional wisdom says that , while shape - function effects are important near the endpoint of the photon spectrum , these effects can be ignored as soon as the cutoff @xmath3 is lowered below about 1.9gev .",
    "this assumption is based on phenomenological studies of shape - function effects using various model functions , which have the unrealistic feature that the distribution function vanishes exponentially for large light - cone momenta @xcite . in other words",
    ", it has been implicitly assumed that there is an instantaneous transition from the `` shape - function region '' of large non - perturbative corrections to the `` ope region '' , in which hadronic corrections to the rate are suppressed by at least two powers of @xmath23 . as a result",
    ", the preferred strategy has been to encourage experimenters to lower the photon - energy cut to a value @xmath24gev , and then to employ the conventional ope for the calculation of the rate , ignoring shape - function effects .    in this paper",
    "we show that this strategy is based on a misconception .",
    "our work is motivated by two considerations .",
    "first , is has recently been shown that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath0-meson distribution functions such as the shape function is not exponential , but rather governed by radiative tails exhibiting a slow , power - like fall - off @xcite .",
    "one should therefore not exclude the possibility of a significant radiation tail in the case of the @xmath1 photon spectrum , meaning that more events than predicted by existing models could be located at low photon energy .",
    "fits to experimental data in the low - energy part of the spectrum , which are based on such models , should thus be taken with caution .",
    "secondly , it has been our desire for a long time to find an analytic way to study the transition from the shape - function region to the ope region .",
    "if it were true that shape - function effects become irrelevant once the cutoff @xmath3 is lowered below 1.9gev , one should be able to see this analytically using some form of a short - distance expansion .",
    "we show that this expansion indeed exists , and that it involves three different short - distance scales .",
    "in addition to the hard scale @xmath4 , an intermediate `` hard - collinear '' scale @xmath5 corresponding to the typical invariant mass of the hadronic final state @xmath20 , and a low scale @xmath6 related to the width of the energy window over which the measurement is performed , become of crucial importance . the physics associated with these scales",
    "can be disentangled using recent results on soft - collinear factorization theorems derived in the framework of effective field theory @xcite .",
    "a systematic treatment consists of matching qcd onto soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite in a first step , in which hard quantum fluctuations are integrated out . in a second step ,",
    "hard - collinear modes are integrated out by matching scet onto heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite .",
    "ultimately , the precision of the theoretical calculations is determined by the value of the lowest short - distance scale @xmath25 , which in practice is of order 1gev or only slightly larger .",
    "the theoretical accuracy that can be reached is therefore not as good as in the case of a conventional heavy - quark expansion applied to the @xmath0 system , but more likely it is similar to ( if not worse than ) the accuracy reached in the description of the inclusive hadronic @xmath26 decay rate @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "however , while the ratio @xmath27 is known to order @xmath28 , the @xmath1 branching ratio is currently only known through order @xmath29 .",
    "while we are aware that this conclusion may come as a surprise to many practitioners in the field of flavor physics , we believe that it is an unavoidable consequence of the analysis presented in this paper .",
    "not surprisingly , then , we find that the error estimates for the partial @xmath1 branching ratio in the literature are too optimistic .",
    "since there are unknown @xmath30 corrections at the low scale @xmath31gev , we estimate the present perturbative uncertainty in the @xmath1 branching ratio with @xmath3 in the range between 1.6 and 1.8gev to be of order 10% .",
    "in addition , there are uncertainties due to other sources , such as the @xmath14- and @xmath32-quark masses .",
    "the combined theoretical uncertainty is of order 15% .",
    "while this is a rather pessimistic conclusion , we stress that the uncertainty is limited by unknown , higher - order perturbative terms , not by non - perturbative effects , which we find to be under good control .",
    "( this is similar to the case of @xmath27 . ) therefore , there is room for a reduction of the error by means of well - controlled perturbative calculations .    in section  [ sec : fact ] , we discuss the qcd factorization formula for the partial @xmath1 decay rate with a cut @xmath2 on photon energy , valid at leading power in the heavy - quark expansion .",
    "contributions associated with the hard , hard - collinear , and soft scales are factorized into a hard function @xmath33 , a jet function @xmath34 , and a shape function @xmath35 .",
    "single and double ( sudakov ) logarithms are systematically resummed to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the rg evolution of the shape function is studied in section  [ sec : sfrg ] , where we present the exact solution to its evolution equation in momentum space .",
    "our main results are derived in section  [ sec : newope ] , where we show how the convolution integral over the shape function in the factorization formula can be calculated using a local ope , provided that the scale @xmath6 is numerically large compared with @xmath36 .",
    "section  [ sec : scheme ] discusses how to eliminate the hqet parameters @xmath4 and @xmath37 defined in the pole scheme , which enter the theoretical expressions , in terms of physical parameters defined in the so - called `` shape - function scheme '' @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the decay rate is completed in section  [ sec : power ] , where we add contributions that are power - suppressed in the heavy - quark expansion . for these small corrections ,",
    "the scale separation we achieve is only approximate and misses some yet unknown terms of order @xmath38 . in section  [ sec : ratios ] , we show that by considering ratios of decay rates one may separate the short - distance physics contained in the hard function @xmath33 from the physics associated with the intermediate and low scales .",
    "for instance , at leading power in @xmath39 the ratio of the @xmath1 branching ratio in a new physics model relative to that in the standard model can be calculated without any sensitivity to scales less than the hard scale @xmath40 , and the same is true for the direct cp asymmetry . in other cases , at leading power some ratios are insensitive to the wilson coefficients in the effective weak hamiltonian and thus to new physics .",
    "examples are the average photon energy @xmath41 , and the ratio of the @xmath1 decay rate with @xmath2 normalized to the total rate .",
    "the latter ratio is particularly interesting , since it can be used to make contact between a simple , fully inclusive rate calculation and our more sophisticated analysis of multi - scale effects .",
    "our numerical results are presented in section  [ sec : numerics ] , followed by a summary and conclusions .",
    "recent results on the factorization of hard , hard - collinear , and soft contributions to inclusive @xmath0-meson decay distributions @xcite allow us to obtain a qcd factorization formula for the integrated @xmath1 decay rate with a cut @xmath2 on photon energy . in the region of large @xmath3 , the leading contribution to the rate can be written in the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 is twice the width of the window in photon energy over which the measurement of the decay rate is performed . in the prefactor , @xmath44 is the fine - structure constant normalized at @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the variable @xmath46 is the `` plus component '' of the 4-momentum of the hadronic final state @xmath20 , which is related to the photon energy by @xmath47 .",
    "the factor @xmath48 under the integral thus equals @xmath49 , where two powers of @xmath18 come from the squared matrix element of the effective weak hamiltonian , and one factor comes from phase space .",
    "the hadronic invariant mass of the final state is @xmath50 .",
    "the endpoint region of the photon spectrum is defined by the requirement that @xmath51 , in which case @xmath52 is called a hard - collinear momentum @xcite .",
    "power corrections to the expression above will be analyzed later ; however , the leading non - perturbative corrections to the total decay rate have already been factored out in ( [ ff ] ) and included in the parameter @xcite ( see table  [ tab : inputs ] in section  [ sec : numerics ] for a list of input parameters ) @xmath53    the factorization formula ( [ ff ] ) was first presented in @xcite . what is new is that we now have a systematic effective field - theory technology to compute the functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 order by order in perturbation theory , and to control their scale dependence in momentum space ( not moment space ) .",
    "also , it is in principle possible to include power - suppressed terms in the heavy - quark expansion . in the factorization formula , @xmath40 is a hard scale , while @xmath54 is an intermediate hard - collinear scale of order the invariant mass of the hadronic final state .",
    "the precise values of these matching scales are irrelevant , since the rate is formally independent of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the hard corrections captured by the function @xmath57 result from the matching of the effective weak hamiltonian of the standard model ( or any of its extensions ) onto a leading - order current operator of scet .",

    "this sensitivity is unavoidable as long as the scale @xmath6 is a hadronic scale , corresponding to the endpoint region of the photon spectrum above , say , 2gev .",
    "the properties of the @xmath1 decay rate and photon spectrum in this region will be discussed in detail elsewhere .",
    "here we are interested in a situation where @xmath3 is lowered out of the shape - function region , such that @xmath25 can be considered large compared with @xmath36 . for orientation , we note that with @xmath115gev and the cutoff @xmath116gev employed in a recent analysis by the belle collaboration @xcite one gets @xmath117gev . for @xmath118gev ( a reference value adopted in @xcite , which at present is below what can be achieved experimentally )",
    "one would obtain @xmath119gev .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , in all previous analyses of the @xmath1 decay rate it was assumed that , once @xmath3 is taken below about 1.9gev , the sensitivity to hadronic physics essentially disappears , and the rate can be computed using a conventional ope at the scale @xmath4 . the main point of the present work is to show that this assumption can not be justified , and that estimating theoretical uncertainties under the hypothesis that the expansion is in powers of @xmath120 and @xmath23 underestimates the magnitude of the true theoretical errors .",
    "as we will show , for values of @xmath3 outside the shape - function region there are three relevant mass scales in the problem besides @xmath36 .",
    "they are the hard scale @xmath4 , the hard - collinear scale @xmath5 , and the low scale @xmath25 itself .",
    "the values of these scales as a function of the photon - energy cutoff @xmath3 are shown in figure  [ fig : scales ] .",
    "the transition from the shape - function region to the region where a conventional ope can be applied is not abrupt but proceeds via an intermediate region , in which a short - distance analysis based on a multi - stage ope ( msope ) can be performed .",
    "the transition from the shape - function region into the msope region occurs when the scale @xmath25 becomes numerically ( but not parametrically ) large compared with @xmath36 .",
    "then terms of order @xmath121 and @xmath122 , which are non - perturbative in the shape - function region , gradually become decent expansion parameters . only for very low values of the cutoff ( @xmath123gev or so )",
    "it is justified to treat @xmath25 and @xmath5 as scales of order @xmath4 .",
    "separating the contributions associated with these scales requires a multi - step procedure , which we develop in the present work .",
    "the first step , the separation of the hard scale from the intermediate scale , has already been achieved in ( [ ff ] ) . to proceed further we use two crucial recent developments .",
    "first , integrals of smooth weight functions @xmath124 with the shape function @xmath125 can be expanded in a series of forward @xmath0-meson matrix elements of local hqet operators , provided that the integration domain is large compared with @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the shape function can be written as the discontinuity of a two - point correlator in momentum space , and thus weighted integrals over @xmath35 can be turned into contour integrals in the complex plane along a circle with radius set by the upper integration limit on @xmath126 ( more precisely , @xmath127 ) .",
    "specifically , the expansion takes the form @xcite @xmath128 where @xmath129 are calculable wilson coefficient functions , @xmath130 and @xmath37 are hqet parameters ( which for the time being are defined in the pole scheme ) @xcite , and the dots represent terms of order @xmath131 or higher .",
    "note that with @xmath6 as defined above we have @xmath132 , which coincides with the upper limit for the integration over @xmath126 in ( [ ff ] ) .",
    "the perturbative expansions of the coefficient functions @xmath129 can be trusted as long as @xmath133 . in order to complete the scale separation ,",
    "it is therefore necessary to evolve the shape function in ( [ ff ] ) from the intermediate scale @xmath134 down to a scale @xmath135 .",
    "this can be achieved using the analytic solution to the integro - differential rg evolution equation for the shape function in momentum space obtained in @xcite .",
    "these manipulations will be discussed in detail in the following two sections .    as a final comment",
    ", we stress that the main purpose of performing the scale separation using the msope is not that this allows us to resum sudakov logarithms by solving rg equations . indeed ,",
    "the `` large logarithm '' @xmath136 is only parametrically large , but not numerically .",
    "what is really important is to disentangle the physics at the low scale @xmath135 , which is `` barely perturbative '' , from the physics associated with higher scales , where a short - distance treatment is on much safer grounds .",
    "it would be wrong to pretend that all perturbative effects in @xmath1 decays are associated with the short - distance scale @xmath137 .",
    "the msope allows us to distinguish between the three coupling constants @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 ( for @xmath117gev ) , which are rather different despite the fact that there are no numerically large logarithms in the problem .",

    "this is the region of interest to experiments at the @xmath0 factories .",
    "the first condition ( @xmath236 ) ensures that a theoretical treatment without shape functions can be applied .",
    "however , the second condition ( @xmath318 ) means that this treatment is _ not _ a conventional heavy - quark expansion in powers of @xmath120 and @xmath23 .",
    "instead , we have shown that three distinct short - distance scales are relevant in this region .",
    "they are the hard scale @xmath4 , the hard - collinear scale @xmath5 , and the low scale @xmath25 .",
    "to separate the contributions associated with these scales requires a multi - scale operator product expansion ( msope ) , we which have constructed in this work .",
    "our approach allows us to study analytically the transition from the shape - function region , where @xmath319 , into the msope region , where @xmath320 , into the region @xmath321 , where a conventional heavy - quark expansion applies .",
    "this is a significant improvement over previous work .",
    "for instance , it has sometimes been argued that exactly where the transition to a conventional heavy - quark expansion occurs is an empirical question , which can not be answered theoretically .",
    "our formalism provides a precise , quantitative answer to this question .",
    "in particular , for @xmath1 with realistic cuts on the photon energy one is _ not _ in a region where a simple short - distance expansion at the scale @xmath4 can be justified .",
    "the precision that can be achieved in the prediction of the @xmath1 branching ratio is , ultimately , determined by how well perturbative and non - perturbative corrections can be controlled at the lowest relevant scale @xmath25 , which in practice is of order 1gev .",
    "consequently , we find larger theoretical uncertainties than previous authors .",
    "these uncertainties are dominated by yet unknown higher - order perturbative effects .",
    "non - perturbative , hadronic effects at the scale @xmath25 appear to be small and under control .",
    "our treatment of the @xmath1 branching ratio includes a complete resummation of logarithms @xmath322 at next - to - next - to - leading order in renormalization - group improved perturbation theory .",
    "this level of precision has not been achieved before . besides the calculations performed here and in @xcite , we have used multi - loop calculations for the cusp anomalous dimension @xcite , the anomalous dimension of the shape function @xcite ( which we have corrected , see appendix  a.1 and also @xcite ) , and the anomalous dimension of the leading - order current operator in soft - collinear effective theory @xcite .",
    "these ingredients are needed in order to achieve a complete separation of the perturbative corrections controlled by the three couplings @xmath120 , @xmath323 , and @xmath308 , which differ in magnitude by about a factor 2 .",
    "our prediction for the cp - averaged @xmath1 with a cut @xmath116gev is @xmath324\\,{}_{\\,-0.30}^{\\,+0.32}\\,[\\mbox{pars.}])\\times 10^{-4}$ ] . with this cut @xmath12 of all events",
    "are contained .",
    "the theory uncertainty we estimate is significantly larger than that found by previous authors , and this fact has important implications for searches of new physics in radiative @xmath0 decays .",
    "quite generally , the constraints on model parameter space have to be relaxed significantly .",
    "we have illustrated this fact with the example of the type - ii two - higgs - doublet model , for which we find that the lower bound on the charged - higgs mass is reduced to approximately 200gev .",
    "this is not the first time in the history of @xmath1 calculations that issues of scale setting have changed the prediction and error estimate for the branching ratio . in @xcite ,",
    "czarnecki and marciano have pointed out that the electromagnetic coupling @xmath44 in the expression for the decay rate should be identified with the fine - structure constant ( normalized at @xmath45 ) , and not with @xmath325 renormalized at the scale of the heavy quark in the decay .",
    "this lowered the prediction for the branching ratio by about 5% .",
    "more recently , gambino and misiak have argued that the charm - quark mass , which enters the next - to - leading order corrections to the @xmath1 rate via penguin loops , should be identified with a running mass @xmath326 with @xmath327 rather than with the pole mass @xcite .",
    "this observation increased the prediction for the branching ratio by about 8% , and at the same time it increased the error estimate associated with the value of the ratio @xmath328 , which before had been taken to be the ( rather well known ) ratio of the two pole masses .",
    "the point we emphasize in the present work , namely that some effects in @xmath1 decays should be described by the couplings @xmath323 and @xmath308 ( and power corrections at the scale @xmath25 ) rather than @xmath120 , is of a similar nature .",
    "however , in our case the change in perspective about the theory of @xmath1 decay is more profound , as it imposes limitations on the very validity of a short - distance treatment .",
    "if the short - distance expansion at the scale @xmath25 fails , then the rate _ can not _ be calculated without resource to non - perturbative shape functions , which would introduce an irreducible amount of model dependence . in practice , while @xmath8gev ( for @xmath9gev ) is probably sufficiently large to trust a short - distance analysis , it would be unreasonable to expect that yet unknown higher - order effects should be less important than in the case of other low - scale applications of qcd , such as in hadronic @xmath26 decays .",
    "given the prominent role of @xmath1 decay in searching for physics beyond the standard model , it is of great importance to have a precise prediction for its rate in the standard model .",
    "the present work shows that the ongoing effort to calculate the dominant parts of the next - to - next - to - leading corrections in the conventional heavy - quark expansion is only part of what is needed to achieve this goal .",
    "equally important will be to compute the dominant higher - order corrections of order @xmath30 and @xmath329 , and to perform a renormalization - group analysis of the leading kinematic power corrections of order @xmath39 .",
    "in fact , our error analysis suggests that these effects are potentially more important that the hard matching corrections at the scale @xmath4 .",
    "let us finish by mentioning two possible approaches for addressing the issue of higher - order perturbative effects at the intermediate and low scales : first , it would be interesting to calculate the terms of order @xmath330 at the scales @xmath134 and @xmath135 . while this would fall short of a complete calculation of @xmath331 corrections , the `` blm terms '' associated with the @xmath112 function are often numerically dominant @xcite .",
    "we stress that the known @xmath332 terms computed in the conventional heavy - quark expansion @xcite are not sufficient for this purpose .",
    "separate computations of @xmath332 terms at the scales @xmath40 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 would be required to perform a meaningful blm scale setting .",
    "this statement is explained in appendix  a.4 .",
    "secondly , the convergence of the perturbative expansion at the low scale @xmath135 may be improved by borrowing the idea of `` contour resummation '' developed in @xcite .",
    "since the shape - function integrals can be written as contour integrals in the complex plane along a circle with radius @xmath25 , in may be more appropriate to use a contour - weighted coupling constant rather than the naive coupling @xmath308 . exploring the numerical impact of these two proposals",
