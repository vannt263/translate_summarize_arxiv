    "transport coefficients characterize the different dissipation mechanisms in non - equilibrium states . at the macroscopic level , they are introduced by phenomenological equations , like the navier - stokes equations for a simple fluid , which predict the time evolution of mass , momentum and energy @xcite .",
    "each transport coefficient is related to the propagation of one ( or more ) of these microscopic quantities , bridging therefore the hydrodynamic and the microscopic scale . in the case of low density gases ,",
    "the macroscopic equations have been justified , their range of validity has been determined , and explicit expressions for the transport coefficients have been obtained using the boltzmann kinetic equation as starting point @xcite . at higher but moderate densities ,",
    "the enskog equation has also proved to give a quite accurate description of a gas of hard spheres or disks .",
    "a remarkable and fundamental development in the statistical mechanics theory of transport processes was the derivation of expressions for the transport coefficients based on equilibrium time - correlation functions .",
    "these are the so - called green - kubo formulas , and they involve different microscopic fluxes @xcite .",
    "these expressions , although formal , are of general validity and have been extensively used for the analysis and modelling of transport in dense systems . in particular , they have been applied to the computation of transport coefficients by means of molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "alternative formal expressions for the transport coefficients are provided by the einstein - helfand formulas @xcite .",
    "these are analogous to einstein s formula for the self - diffusion coefficient in terms of the second moment of the displacements .",
    "the einstein - helfand expressions for the other transport coefficients involve moments of dynamical variables which are the time integrals of the microscopic fluxes appearing in the green - kubo relations .    in the last years",
    ", there has been a revived interest on transport processes in systems composed by hard particles motivated by the study of granular media in general , and granular gases as a special case @xcite .",
    "the simplest model for them is an assembly of inelastic hard spheres or disks , in which the inelasticity is accounted for only through one constant parameter , the coefficient of normal restitution . in the low density limit ,",
    "hydrodynamic navier - stokes like equations , with explicit expressions for the transport coefficients , have been obtained for this model , by starting from the inelastic extension of the boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the transport coefficients for a dilute granular gas can be expressed in the form of generalized green - kubo relations @xcite .",
    "the enskog equation has also been extended to inelastic particles @xcite , but its density and inelasticity range of validity is not clear . on the other hand , formally exact relations between transport coefficients and appropriate correlation functions , similar to the green - kubo and einstein - helfand formulas , appear to be limited up to now to the low density limit mentioned above and to the simplest cases of tagged particle motion @xcite , although there have been some more general proposals @xcite .",
    "therefore , for high densities , the only available hydrodynamic theory for granular systems is restricted to the so - called quasi - elastic limit .",
    "the transport coefficients are given in that limit by the same expressions as for elastic systems , and dissipation in collisions is taken into account only by a new term in the energy balance equation @xcite .    the first calculations of transport coefficients for hard - sphere systems by means of equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations go back to the pioneer works by alder and coworkers @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the values of the transport coefficients on the density and also on the number of particles used in the simulations have been analyzed . at high densities , significant deviations from the enskog theory predictions",
    "are observed , especially for the self - diffusion and shear viscosity coefficients @xcite .    in spite of all the work done for three dimensional systems , it is hard to find results for two dimensions , i.e. , for a fluid of hard disks .",
    "it could be argued that this is due to the presence of long time tails in the equilibrium correlation functions appearing in the green - kubo expressions of the transport coefficients , but it must be noticed that they do not invalidate by themselves the possibility of a hydrodynamic description @xcite . a notable exception is ref .",
    "@xcite , where the viscosity of a system of hard disks is measured by using an einstein - helfand expression .",
    "since , in granular materials , a wide range of densities is typically realized , it is useful to measure the transport coefficients of a system of hard disks in the whole range of densities . in this context , a global equation of state for a system of hard disks has been proposed @xcite . the equation has proven to be accurate for densities ranging from the low density region to the highest crystallization limit where caging effects appear and free volume theories are relevant .",
    "more precisely , it appears to be almost exact for most densities , except for those when the system changes from a disordered state to an ordered one . in this transition regime ,",
    "memory effects become important , hysteresis shows up , and the proposed equation of state is only an approximate description for very slow changes in the density .    in this paper , the transport coefficients of a system of hard disks will be measured by means of einstein - helfand expressions that are appropriate for molecular dynamics simulations with periodic boundary conditions , using the minimum image convention @xcite . for continuous interaction potentials , this method is strictly equivalent to the green - kubo method and has the advantages of directly showing the positivity of the transport coefficients and of being based on a straightforward , numerically robust accumulation @xcite . in the case of hard particles , there is a fundamental reason to employ methods based on helfand - einstein expressions for the transport coefficients .",
    "the green - kubo relations , except in the case of self - diffusion , involve forces between the particles , which are ill - defined for hard spheres or disks and there is no trivial way to extend them to hard - particle fluids .",
    "in fact , a recent careful analysis of the dynamics of a system of hard spheres has shown that the correct green - kubo expressions for this system have a new singular contribution due to instantaneous collisions , as well as the usual time integral of the flux correlation functions @xcite .",
    "the singular part vanishes in the low density limit , but gives a relevant contribution at high densities . on the other hand",
    ", the einstein - helfand formulas do not involve the forces , and have the same form for both continuous ( soft ) and rigid ( hard - sphere ) potentials .",
    "it must be stressed that it is an einstein - helfand method that was already numerically implemented by alder _",
    "_ in their study of the transport coefficients in hard - sphere fluids @xcite .",
    "the most interesting finding of the present study is that the shear viscosity shows a divergence at the crystallization density ( in a non - sheared system ) , while the heat conductivity is correlated to the isotropic pressure .",
    "thus , while pressure and heat conductivity show a small drop at crystallization ( due to the better ordering of the particles ) , self - diffusion vanishes at it , and shear viscosity diverges .",
    "this divergence is well below the excluded volume caused divergence of pressure and heat conductivity at the maximum density possible in hard disk systems .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the einstein - helfand expressions for the transport coefficients are revised , and written in a way that is appropriate for hard sphere molecular dynamics simulations with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the special case of self - diffusion , in which the actual trajectories of the particles along different cells must be followed , is first discussed .",
    "for all the other transport coefficients , it is shown that a decomposition of the contributions to the transport coefficients into a kinetic and a collisional part , allows the use of the minimum image convention . moreover , the decomposition is especially useful for event driven simulation algorithms . in sec .",

    "in this paper , the transport coefficients of a system of elastic hard disks have been evaluated by means of equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations . in order to avoid the fundamental difficulties recently identified in the use of the standard green - kubo formulas in hard - particle systems @xcite , a helfand - einstein representation has been employed .",
    "the consideration of periodic boundary conditions in the simulation of a non - sheared , isotropic , homogeneous , freely evolving system of elastic hard spheres or disks forces some modifications of the usual einstein - helfand s formulas for the transport coefficients , especially if the minimum image convention is used . moreover , the expressions proposed here are especially suitable for event driven methods .",
    "they allow a detailed study of the dependence of the coefficients on the system size and density .    for the self - diffusion coefficient , @xmath4 , the enskog approximation leads to values that underestimate the simulation results by factors up to two , for moderate values of the density ( @xmath129 ) , the discrepancies being already relevant at rather low densities .",
    "the observed density dependence of the transport coefficient is well fitted by a third order polynomial for @xmath130 , with coefficients that slightly depend on the number of particles , @xmath9 , of the system .",
    "it has been verified that @xmath4 tends to a well defined limit as @xmath9 becomes large enough . at higher densities ,",
    "the transition liquid - solid is clearly depicted in the behavior of the self - diffusion coefficient .",
    "it rapidly falls to zero as a consequence of the caging of the particles .",
    "finite size effects are more relevant for dense systems , in which the self - diffusion coefficient approaches its asymptotic value exponentially with @xmath9 .    for the shear viscosity",
    "the dependence of the results on the size of the system is much smaller",
    ". also much weaker deviations from the enskog prediction are observed at low and intermediate densities .",
    "nevertheless , closer to the gas - solid transition , a power law divergent behavior has been identified .",
    "interestingly , the density value for which the viscosity would become eventually singular ( @xmath131 ) , agrees with the density at which the system begins to show an ordered triangular structure @xcite .",
    "note that the results here presented refer to `` non - sheared '' systems .",
    "we have avoided therefore the problem of the system becoming inhomogeneous and developing a shearband @xcite .",
    "a sheared system will not show the divergence found for the viscosity because of the shearbanding instability .",
    "the pressure also diverges but at a considerably higher density @xmath132 . at the crystallization density @xmath133 ,",
    "both pressure and heat conductivity show a drop relative to the enskog prediction due to the better ordering in the crystalline phase ( see fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) .",
    "the use of a more elaborated expression of the pair correlation function , valid in a wider range of densities than henderson s approximation , improves the agreement of our data with enskog theory .",
    "there were no data obtained for the shear viscosity above @xmath108 .",
    "in conclusion , we have found enskog theory working rather well for pressure , heat - conductivity and shear viscosity well below the crystallization density @xmath105 .",
    "when the enskog expressions are corrected by an appropriate pair correlation function @xmath134 , which accounts for the better ordering in the crystalline phase , the theory performs well for pressure and heat - conductivity up to the maximal possible density @xmath135 .",
    "only the shear viscosity shows a power - law divergence at @xmath136 with values above enskog theory already becoming visible at intermediate densities .",
    "thus , shear viscosity behaves differently than the other transport coefficients studied .",
    "its divergence , implying that the shear modes are hindered for @xmath137 .",
    "this could in fact be understood as one reason for shear - band formation .",
    "a sheared system at high densities typically splits into shear bands ( with lower density ) and a compressed dense crystal ( with correspondingly higher density ) . from a different point of view ,",
    "our observations are also consistent with the concept of dilatancy : a dense packing with @xmath137 can only be sheared by first experiencing dilatancy so that @xmath87 drops below @xmath105 .",
