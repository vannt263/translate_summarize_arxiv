    "bulges of early - type spirals and elliptical galaxies comprise primarily old low - mass stars , which account for more than half of the total stellar mass in the local universe ( fukugita , hogan , & peebles 1998 ) .",
    "these stars collectively generate a long - lasting feedback via mass injection from evolved stars ( mainly red giant branch stars and planetary nebulae ) in the form of stellar winds and energy input from type ia sne . because of the sn heating , the ism should be mostly in x - ray - emitting plasma inside galactic bulges , where little cool gas is present ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observations have shown that the x - ray - inferred gas mass and energy are far less than those empirical predictions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in other words , the bulk of stellar feedback expected is not observed @xcite .",
    "this `` missing '' stellar feedback problem becomes particularly acute in so - called low @xmath1 ( i.e. , the ratio of x - ray luminosity to blue band luminosity ) bulge - dominated galaxies ( typically sa spirals , s0 , and low mass ellipticals ) . after removing the contribution from point sources in those relatively deep _",
    "chandra _ observations , the remaining `` diffuse '' x - ray component generally shows a soft spectrum , indicating a thermal origin @xcite , and its luminosity is only a few percent of the expected type ia sne energy input @xcite .",
    "the inferred total mass of the x - ray - emitting gas falls far short of what is deduced from the stellar mass loss over the galaxy s lifetime @xcite .",
    "the presence of a bulge - wide outflow may solve the `` missing '' stellar feedback problem ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the 1d solution of an sn - heated bulge outflow , however , has problems .",
    "the physical state of the gas outflow mainly depends on the mass and energy input rates as well as the gravitational field . within those low @xmath1",
    "galactic bulges of typical mass and energy input rates , a hot bulge wind should be present theoretically ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". however , observations of the diffuse hot ism are apparently at odds with the theoretical wind models in nearly all aspects .",
    "firstly , the predicted x - ray luminosity in a bulge wind scenario is a few orders of magnitude smaller than the observed ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , the expected wind temperature is about @xmath21kev or higher , while the observation - inferred gas temperatures are substantially lower ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thirdly , the estimated x - ray surface brightness profile of the wind should be steeper than that of starlight @xcite , but the observed profiles of diffuse emission distributions are fairly extended in most low @xmath1 bulges or ellipticals ( e.g. fig .  7 in @xcite",
    "; fig .  5 in @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the predicted mean iron abundance of the diffuse hot gas is 37 times solar because of the type ia sn enrichment ( e.g. , @xcite ) , whereas the observed spectra usually indicate near- or sub - solar iron abundance .",
    "some , if not all , of the listed discrepancies may arise from various oversimplifications of the existing 1d models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in such models the mechanical energy input of sne is always treated as pure thermal energy smoothly injected into the ism . in reality , however , sne , sporadic in both time and space , should naturally produce inhomogeneity in the ism .",
    "the density and temperature inhomogeneity may significantly affect the x - ray spectrum and luminosity , which are proportional to the density square .",
    "explosive energy injection in a hot tenuous medium can be transported away in form of sound wave , so the sn heating is not local ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , whether or not the sn ejecta of each individual snr can be well mixed with the surrounding material is crucial to address the apparent low abundance puzzle of the hot gas .",
    "these effects need to be quantified in order to correctly interpret the existing observations .    in this work ,",
    "we present a pilot study to explore the properties of hot gas in galactic bulges by conducting 3d hydrodynamic simulations . in these simulations ,",
    "sne are randomly generated that statistically and spatially follow the stellar light distribution .",
    "based on the mean temperature and density of the surrounding medium , we adaptively determine the appropriate sizes of individual snrs and generate their density , temperature , and velocity profiles from a library of 1d simulated snr templates .",
    "we then plant such structured snr seeds into the 3d simulation grid and let them evolve .",
    "we terminate the simulation when it reaches a statistically steady state .",
    "the 3d simulations not only provide us with the dynamical structures of snrs , but also enable us to trace the thermal and chemical states of the bulge wind material .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in  2 we describe the main physical ingredients of the bulge wind model and the numerical methods .",
    "the results are presented in  3 and discussed in  4 .",
    "we summarize our results and conclusions in  5 .",
    "we model hot gas inside a galactic bulge that originates from continuous stellar injection in the form of stellar winds , and is heated by sporadic type ia sne .",
    "the dynamics of the hot gas is described by the following equations : @xmath3= -\\rho\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\nabla\\phi + s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle}sn}(\\mathbf{r},t ) + s_{*}(r ) -n_t n_e \\lambda(t ) , \\\\ & \\ & p   =   n k t\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 denote density , velocity vector , pressure , temperature , and total specific energy of the hot gas ; and @xmath9 is the gravitational potential field ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the number density of ions and electrons ; @xmath12 is the total number density ; @xmath13 is the normalized cooling function taken from @xcite , assuming an optically thin plasma with solar abundance ; @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the mass and energy input from evolved stars .",
    "the mass and energy input from individual sne , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , are explicitly expressed as a function of position and time .",
    "we adopt parameters appropriate to the bulge of the milky way .",
    "the stellar mass distribution of the bulge follows the potential - density pair of the hernquist profile @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the scale radius and @xmath20 is the total mass of the bulge . here",
    "we set the @xmath20 and @xmath19 to be @xmath21 and 0.42kpc ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "other components of our galaxy , such as the disk and dark matter halo , have only little effects on the gas dynamics within the galactic bulge and are thus ignored in our simulations .",
    "the stellar mass loss from evolved stars , @xmath22 , follows the stellar mass distribution .",
    "the total stellar mass loss rate of the bulge ( @xmath23 ) is constrained by current theoretical predictions and related observations , although the true value can not be observed directly inside the bulge .",
    "it is inferred from our knowledge of the stellar population and evolution , together with observations of the mass loss of similar stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "estimates of the stellar mass loss rate may vary by more than a factor of two . assuming a single stellar population with a standard salpeter initial mass function",
    ", @xcite found that the stellar mass loss rate can be approximated as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the current optical blue - band luminosity in units of @xmath26 of the stellar population and @xmath27 is its age in units of 10@xmath28gyr . adopting a blue - band luminosity of @xmath29 ( @xcite , p571 ) and an age of 10gyr for the bulge",
    ", we have @xmath30 .",
    "@xcite directly relates mass loss to the total mass of a stellar population ( see also @xcite ) , which gives @xmath31 .",
    "another estimate based on observations of asymptotic giant branch stars gives @xmath32@xmath33 , consistent with the stellar mass loss rate inferred for a sample of nine ellipticals from mid - ir observations @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath34 for the galactic bulge can be as high as 0.13@xmath35 .",
    "we therefore run models with different mass loss rates , as discussed in  2.3 .",
    "the energy feedback of the stellar bulge is dominated by the mechanical energy from type ia sne . following the convention",
    ", we assume that each sn releases @xmath36 mechanic energy .",
    "we take the type ia sn rate of e - s0 galaxies to be 0.12 snu ( snu is defined as one sn per @xmath37 per century ; @xcite ; @xcite , p467 ) , which gives about one sn per 3000 year in our galactic bulge . the energy input from the stellar wind , @xmath38 ,",
    "is assumed to be thermalized to their stellar kinematic temperature @xmath39k , corresponding to a stellar velocity dispersion around 100 km@xmath40 @xcite .",
    "overall this energy is almost negligible compared with that from sne .",
    "each sn also ejects an adopted ( chandrasekhar ) mass of 1.4@xmath41 .",
    "though the total amount of sn ejecta is much less than that of the mass loss from evolved stars , the sn ejecta contribute most of the metals , especially iron . in order to trace how these iron - rich ejecta mix with the stellar wind material , we additionally incorporate a separate advection equation @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the mass fraction of the @xmath44th component , with the constraint @xmath45 . in the present simulations we have two components , the iron mass and the rest of gas mass .",
    "the iron mass from sne , assumed to be 0.7@xmath41 per sn @xcite , is part of the sn ejecta .",
    "the iron mass fraction in stellar wind material is @xmath46 ( i.e. , the nominal solar ) .",
    "the iron abundance can trace the sn enrichment .",
    "any zone with iron abundance greater than the solar value is enriched by sne .",
    "thereafter we refer the iron ejecta as purely from sne .",
    "the simulations are performed with flash @xcite , an eulerian astrophysical hydrodynamics code with the adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) capability , developed by the flash center at the university of chicago .",
    "flash solves the euler equations and uses the piecewise - parabolic method to deal with compressible flows with shocks .",
    "we take the advantage of the amr capability to accurately include the heating of individual snrs .      to help set up the 3d simulations ,",
    "we first simulate a 1d model . assuming that the energy and mass inputs are continuous in time and spherically symmetric in space",
    ", we may simplify eqs .",
    "( 1)(3 ) into a 1d problem .",
    "for a specific galactic bulge , the _ crossing time _ the time required for the gas to flow from the center to the outer boundary is a few million years ( assuming a size of a few kpc for the bulge ) , significantly shorter than the evolutionary time scale of the stellar energy and mass input rates .",
    "therefore , the problem can be regarded as time - independent .",
    "the bulge outflow can reach a steady state if radiative cooling does not affect the dynamics .",
    "we run the 1d simulations by using a gas - free initial condition and by continuing to add corresponding energy and mass in each zone .",
    "flash handles the mass and energy inputs with an operator split method . at each time",
    "step it first solves the eulerian equations without the source terms , then explicitly updates the solution to account for the corresponding source terms . to properly conserve the mass , momentum , and energy",
    ", we implement this procedure in three steps : first , we update the gas density according to the amount of mass input in that step ; next , we modify the gas velocity to satisfy momentum conservation ; finally , we modify the gas temperature to conserve the total energy .",
    "we verified that this implementation can exactly produce the analytical solution of a star cluster wind @xcite .",
    "the system eventually evolves to a steady state .",
    "such a steady outflow solution can be analytically derived without including cooling @xcite .",
    "if the 1d bulge outflow solution has a sonic point , a subsonic outflow can then develop into a supersonic outflow ( i.e. , a bulge wind ) .",
    "the final state of such a wind does not depend on the specific initial condition . under certain conditions ( e.g. , due to significant radiative cooling or low specific energy input ;",
    "see  4.2 for more discussion ) , the sonic point may not exist and the gas outflow may be sensitive to the boundary condition as well as the initial condition .",
    "the use of the outflow ( sometimes called zero - gradient ) boundary condition would then introduce an artificial force inserted by the leveled - off pressure that would produce perturbation , propagating inwards on a time scale comparable to the crossing time .",
    "this situation would also occur if a simulation region were too small to include the sonic point ( if present ) .",
    "thus we use the 1d solution to make sure that the sonic point is included in the 3d simulation domain ( a cubic box ) .",
    "two 3d simulations are performed to examine the properties of galactic bulge winds .",
    "their key parameters are listed in table  [ t : para ] for quick reference .",
    "the major difference between these two simulations is the mass loss rate : @xmath47 for model a ( the 3d reference model ) and @xmath48 for model b , representing the uncertainty in the mass loss rate (  2.1 ) or extra mass loading expected in galactic bulges (  4.2 ; see also li & wang 2009 in preparation ) .",
    "the highest spatial resolutions are @xmath2 3.9 and 4.9pc respectively for the two models .",
    "the effective single - grid resolution of the simulations are @xmath49 and @xmath50 zones .",
    "the steady wind flow established in the 1d model is used as the initial flow with an iron mass fraction of the solar value ( @xmath51 ) .    in the 3d realizations ,",
    "sne explode randomly according to a poisson process with the mean overall rate .",
    "their spatial distribution statistically follows the stellar density distribution",
    ". it would be computationally very expensive , if even possible , to simulate the evolution of each snr on sub - parsec scales within the bulge - wide flow .",
    "instead , we adaptively plant individual structured snr seeds into the 3d simulation grid and then let them evolve .",
    "we do not simply adopt the sedov solution , which is generally not appropriate for an snr evolving in a hot tenuous medium @xcite , especially when the dynamics of the sn ejecta are considered . according to a scaling scheme detailed in a separate paper @xcite , the structure of an snr can be scaled from a template snr simulated in a different ambient medium setting .",
    "we have constructed a library of template snrs from 1d simulations , assuming a selection of ambient gas temperatures and densities .",
    "each entry of this library consists of the density , temperature , and velocity profiles at a particular age and a forward shock radius .",
    "we apply the scaling scheme to dynamically generate the profiles of each snr seed . specifically , we select a spherical region around each sn location within which the density and pressure are sufficiently smooth , using the l@xmath52ner s error ( flash user s guide ; @xcite ) as the estimator .",
    "we find that at least 500 zones ( i.e. , more than 5 points for the radial profiles ) are needed to reasonably well represent a structured snr seed .",
    "this in turn requires the minimum embedding radius to be at least 20pc , given the spatial resolution that is achievable in our simulations . with the embedding radius determined , we calculate the mean density and gas - mass - weighted temperature of the enclosed gas to find the most suitable template in the library and to form the required snr seed @xcite .",
    "the planting of an snr seed also takes a few steps .",
    "first we refine the affected region to the highest refinement level .",
    "then we normalize the snr structures to ensure the conservations of mass , momentum , and energy within that region ( see appendix a for details ) .",
    "finally , the innermost region that encloses 0.7@xmath53 is traced as the pure iron ejecta of the embedded snr .",
    "this embedding procedure is well parallelized and allows for linear scaling up to at least 1024 processors .",
    "cccccc a & 0.05 & 1.1 & 1.0 & 3.9 & 4 + b & 0.1 & 1.1 & 1.8 & 4.9 & 10 [ t : para ]    to save computing time , one may simulate only one octant of the bulge by adopting a reflecting boundary condition at the surfaces across the center . a test run , however , shows that a reflecting boundary condition introduces correlated wave interactions when an sn explodes near the reflecting boundaries . this effect is not physical and difficult to quantify .",
    "it is most serious near the bulge center where three reflecting boundaries intersect and the stellar density , hence the rate of the sne , is the highest .",
    "thus we resort to simulating the whole bulge , which is centered inside the simulation domain .",
    "however , we only simulate one octant at full resolution , while the highest resolution in the rest of the grid is degraded by a factor of four , except for regions where snrs seeds have just been embedded .",
    "these regions are forced to have the full resolution in all octants , and are held for @xmath54 years before returning to the default amr .",
    "we use refinement estimators acting on the density and pressure to determine whether a block needs to be refined or derefined , adopting the default criterion suggested ( in flash user s guide , i.e. , refining a block if any estimator is greater than 0.8 and derefining it if all estimators are less than 0.2 ) .",
    "regions outside the sonic radius ( which is obtained from the 1d model ) are allowed to have a lower refinement level that gradually decreases with radius .",
    "this approach circumvents the reflection boundary problem at the expense of about 60% more computing time , which is acceptable .",
    "in addition , it allows us to examine the resolution effect within a single run .",
    "a statistically steady state of such a 3d simulation can be reached after a few crossing times .",
    "we quantify the establishment of the steady state of a 3d bulge wind by examining the relative variation of its global quantities such as the total mass and energy . here",
    "we define the variation as the change of a given quantity relative to its initial value , i.e. , the relative difference between 3d and 1d .",
    "the variation of the total mass within 2.0kpc of model a is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : massen_evol]a by the solid line . compared to its initial value , the total mass increases to @xmath55 on average and fluctuates around this value with a period of @xmath210myr , comparable to the flow crossing time . as expected , the mass variation within the inner 1.2kpc radius , displayed as the dashed line in the figure , has a shorter fluctuation period .",
    "the expected iron mass fraction , if fully mixed with stellar wind material , is 0.35% ( @xmath56 times the solar abundance ) in model a. we show the variation of the iron abundance ( in the solar units ) in fig .",
    "[ f : massen_evol]c .",
    "it takes about 5myr for the hot gas inside 2kpc to gain the expected iron mass .",
    "the variation of the iron abundance is smaller than that of total mass , mainly because it actually only reflects the ratio of total iron mass to the total gas mass . by introducing random sn events in the 3d simulations ,",
    "the globally conserved quantities are no longer constant as they should be in a 1d spherical steady flow .",
    "only when a hydrodynamic steady state is established in the simulations ( i.e. , the fluctuation has reached a statistically stable level ) is the comparison between 1d and 3d results meaningful .",
    "we check the resolution effect based primarily on x - ray luminosity , which is particularly sensitive to the density structure in the simulations .",
    "we find that the x - ray luminosity difference between the high resolution octant and the other seven octants is rather small .",
    "this is partly because the majority of the emission arises from individual snrs which are resolved at the same resolution in all the octants . to examine the resolution effect more directly ,",
    "we resume model a with an increased spatial resolution by a factor of two , and let it only evolve for 0.1myr , limited by the available computing time .",
    "this simulation produces finer structures of the bulge gas , and the resultant x - ray luminosity increases about 3% in the high resolution octant and about 10% in the other seven octants .",
    "this demonstrates that our results are quite robust and are only slightly affected by the spatial resolution .",
    "in this section we present the gas properties extracted from the 3d hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "we first detail the results of model a ( fig .",
    "[ f : bgw0_structure ] ) and then present model b ( fig .",
    "[ f : dblm_structure ] ) for comparison .",
    "data near the outer region are excluded in our analysis to avoid any potential artifacts introduced by the assumed outer boundary condition of the simulations .",

    "the prominent features are various shell - like and filamentary density structures .",
    "these shell - like structures of snrs are easily identified in the outer region , where the explosions are less frequent and each snr can evolve individually to a large volume before colliding with others .",
    "individual snrs near the bulge center appear more compact because of the high gas density and pressure and frequent interactions with adjacent remnants .",
    "evolved remnants tend to be dispersed and advected outward .",

    "the luminosity of model b in the low energy band increases dramatically ; e.g , in the 0.2 - 0.5kev band it is more than 60 times larger than that of model a. this increase is due to the combination of higher density and lower temperature ( hence higher emissivity ) of the weak bulge wind ( see  4.2 discussion ) .",

    "[ f : radial_prof ] compares averaged radial profiles for the density , temperature , velocity , and pressure in a few snapshots of model a with the corresponding 1d results . the velocity and pressure profiles averaged in radial bins follow the 1d results excellently . in the 3d simulation",
    "there is no unique location of the sonic point to divide the supersonic flow from subsonic flow since the velocities and temperatures vary greatly from point to point .",
    "nevertheless , the average hot gas outflow does become supersonic at @xmath85 , close to the 1d sonic point ( marked by the arrow ) .",
    "the density and temperature profiles deviate significantly from the corresponding 1d results in the inner region ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "in particular , the density profile tends to be more centrally peaked in the 3d simulations .",
    "this temporary accumulation of stellar wind material is largely due to the continuous mass injection and the lack of prompt heating .",
    "the variation of the density profiles , especially near the center , is closely coupled with the realization of sn events . at large radii",
    "the density and temperature profiles become nearly identical to the 1d results . since the radiation of the bulge wind is negligible , the identical radial profiles at large radii are expected due to the conservation of mass and energy .",
    "thus the nature of sporadic sn explosions does not affect the overall gas dynamics on large scales . in fig .",
    "[ f : radial_prof_res ] we compare the profiles of the octant at full resolution to profiles of three low resolution octants .",
    "the figure suggests that the profiles show numerical convergence at a level better than the random variance among realizations .    on average",
    "the gas temperature in the 3d simulation has a lower and flatter profile than that in the corresponding 1d result . in the 1d model",
    ", the gas temperature is the highest at the center and decreases outwards monotonically .",
    "in contrast , the average gas temperature in a 3d simulation can be much lower at the center than in the surroundings , because of non - uniformly distributed sn heating .",
    "the distribution of sn heating depends on the ambient medium .",
    "an sn that explodes in a dense environment like the bulge center , heats a small region to a rather high temperature .",
    "the small amount of overheated gas advects outward and carries a large fraction of the sn energy with it , while leaving much of the central gas unheated .",
    "the unheated gas accumulates around the bulge center , resulting in a relatively steep density profile near the bulge center ( see fig .",
    "[ f : radial_prof ] panel a ) .",
    "the large density gradient makes it even harder for the sn heating to be uniformly distributed near the center , so it tends to be transported to outer low density regions ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "thus a low - temperature inner region naturally forms under the sporadic sn heating scenario .",
    "it is also worth noting that the temperature profile depends on the weighting methods , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : cmpt ] . the em - weighted value , which closely resembles that inferred from x - ray observations , is relatively low because it is primarily determined by the low - temperature denser material ( see  3.2 ) . in comparison ,",
    "the temperature profiles from different weighting methods are identical in the 1d model .",
    "this is because in the 1d model , all quantities such as temperature , density , and pressure are monotonic functions of radius .",
    "therefore the density has a one - to - one correspondence to the temperature , which also explains the single - line gas distribution of the 1d model in the temperature and density space ( fig .",
    "[ f : bgw0_phase ] ) .",
    "the integrated gas properties of model a are also significantly different from those of the 1d model , such as the em distributions , spectra , x - ray luminosities , etc . in the 1d model the em peaks at @xmath87k and",
    "is truncated sharply at low or high temperatures ( three - dots - dashed magenta line in fig .",
    "[ f : bgw0_dem ] ) , while the em distribution of model a peaks at a lower temperature and is much broader .",
    "but the difference between the spectral shape of model a and the corresponding 1d model is small in the 0.7 - 3.0kev band ( see fig .  [",
    "f : spectrum ] ) .",
    "model a has slightly higher ( about 30% more ) x - ray luminosity in this band . at lower ( @xmath88kev ) and higher energy bands ( @xmath89kev ) , model a gives much higher photon fluxes , especially for some line features , such as ovii ( 22.0 , 0.56kev ) and helium - like iron k@xmath90 ( @xmath91 ; 6.7kev ) , largely due to the much broader temperature distribution .",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath91 line emission in model b increases but the line in its corresponding 1d model is missing because of the relatively low and narrow gas temperature distribution in the 1d model .",
    "there are two direct predictions from the 3d simulations that help to understand partly the observational puzzles faced by the 1d wind model .",
    "first , the relatively low emission - weighted gas temperature is consistent with the results inferred from the diffuse x - ray emission in galactic bulges and elliptical galaxies ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "second , the sn ia ejecta are not fully mixed with the stellar wind material inside the galactic bulge , and most of the x - ray emission is contributed by the stellar wind material shocked by sn blastwaves .",
    "thus the x - ray spectra in general reflect only the metal abundance of the stellar wind material , which is consistent with the apparent solar metallicity inferred from the diffuse x - ray emission in a large sample of ellipticals ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the broadening of the gas temperature distribution can also affect the determination of metallicity .",
    "a low metal abundance could be obtained by fitting the x - ray spectra of such gas with an isothermal plasma model .",
    "this effect is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ f : simspec ] .",
    "we simulate the x - ray spectrum based on the mekal model in xspec , adopting the approximate log - normal em distribution ( see  3.2 ) and a solar abundance .",
    "the data points in the upper panel show a simulated spectrum of about @xmath92 photons .",
    "if we fit this simulated spectrum with a single - temperature mekal model , the resulting abundance is only about half solar ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the fit is statistically acceptable ( with @xmath94 ) , partly due to the small counting statistics .",
    "if the simulated spectrum contains @xmath95 photons instead , the fit is no longer acceptable ( with @xmath96 ) and the best fit tends to give a much lower abundance ( about one - third solar ) .",
    "a two - temperature component model can significantly improve the fit , and the abundances are in general less than one solar , although they are not strongly constrained . thus the abundance is likely underestimated by fitting an x - ray spectrum of gas with broad temperature and density distributions ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "given the low resolution and small signal - to - noise ratio of x - ray spectra typically available for diffuse hot gas , it is difficult to distinguish gas with a broad temperature distribution from an isothermal plasma , especially within a narrow energy band . in fig .",
    "[ f : spectrum ] we plot an arbitrarily normalized spectrum of a single - temperature hot plasma ( 0.8kev for model a and 0.4 kev for model b , where the em distribution of the corresponding 1d model peaks ) .",
    "the spectra of the 3d simulation and the isothermal plasma model are similar in the 0.52.0kev band .",
    "this approximation gives a potential shortcut to fit the x - ray observations coarsely with only one or two gas components , which are not necessarily able to reveal the actual physical and chemical state of the ism . with higher resolution spectra",
    ", line diagnostics may provide additional useful information to reveal the gas properties .",
    "however , the models still predict far lower x - ray luminosities than observed .",
    "the observed diffuse x - ray luminosity in the 0.52  kev band of our galactic bulge and m31 bulge is about @xmath97 @xcite . using the reference mass and energy input rates , the bolometric x - ray luminosity predicated by the 1d wind model is no more than @xmath98 .",
    "the inhomogeneous structures of the gas density and temperature in model a increase by no more than half an order of magnitude the luminosity in the 0.5 - 2kev band ( table 2 ) .",
    "this under - prediction of the observed luminosity remains a serious problem for the models .",
    "the parameter with the strongest influence on the luminosity of the bulge wind is the stellar mass loss rate . as demonstrated in model b which has a doubled mass input rate , its mean gas density increases while the temperature decreases .",
    "the x - ray emission increases by a factor of @xmath99 in the 0.5 - 2.0kev band .",
    "this enhancement is due to the increase of both density and emissivity . to quantitatively understand this trend ,",
    "let us first consider a scaling relation of the bulge wind .",
    "the specific heating @xmath100 determines the mean central gas temperature of the wind solution . in a steady flow ,",
    "the velocity @xmath101 ( e.g. @xcite ) , so long as gravitational potential energy remains unimportant .",
    "we have @xmath102 from the mass conservation equation , and @xmath103 from the energy conservation equation . for gas with a temperature between 0.5 and 1.0kev ,",
    "the x - ray emissivity in the 0.52.0kev band is roughly inversely proportional to the temperature [ e.g. , @xmath104 based on the mekal model ] .",
    "the total x - ray emission is then @xmath105 . for winds with the same @xmath106 the velocity and temperature profiles are the same , and density profiles differ only in their normalization , which is proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "we thus use @xmath107 to denote the separate change of either @xmath34 or @xmath108 , e.g , @xmath109 is equivalent to @xmath110 for a fixed energy input , and @xmath111 to @xmath112 for a fixed mass input . fig .  [",
    "f : en_vs_em ] shows the luminosity in the 0.52 kev as a function of @xmath106 based on a suite of 1d simulations . in this plot",
    "the luminosities are normalized to that of a 1d reference model ( @xmath113 ; corresponding to model a ) .",
    "the scaling relations of @xmath114 versus @xmath34 and @xmath108 closely match the simulations when @xmath107 is larger than 0.5 . in the adopted galactic bulge ,",
    "if the specific energy approaches one - third of the reference value , the simulated luminosities increase sharply and no longer follow the scaling relation , because the gravitational potential becomes dynamically important for such a small @xmath106 .",
    "the corresponding results of models a and b are also plotted in fig .",
    "[ f : en_vs_em ] to show the effects of gas inhomogeneity .",
    "the ratio of the 0.5 - 2.0 kev luminosity of model a to that of the corresponding 1d model is about 2 , and the ratio is about 3 for model b.    let @xmath106 be fixed at the reference value in model a , the velocity and temperature profiles of the wind should remain the same and @xmath115 .",
    "hence , both @xmath108 and @xmath34 need to increase by an order of magnitude in order to boost the x - ray luminosity to match that observed in the m31 bulge .",
    "although a bulge wind with a reduced @xmath106 can significantly increase the diffuse x - ray emission as demonstrated in model b , it is unlikely to be the best solution . in the presence of a reasonable dark matter halo with properties like that of the milky way galaxy ( e.g. , @xmath116 ,",
    "@xmath117kpc , an nfw profile with a concentration parameter of 15 ) , @xmath118 of the available energy input in model b is required for the escape of all the stellar ejecta to beyond the virial radius .",
    "thus the bulge wind in model b is not energetic enough to escape the galaxy potential well and the bulge wind material must accumulate within the virial radius .",
    "this accumulated material may form a considerable circum - galactic medium ( cgm ) that could eventually quench the bulge wind @xcite .",
    "the gas outflow might be subsonic in the vicinity of galactic bulges and other ellipticals with low @xmath1 ratios under the interaction between the bulge wind and cgm .",
    "the subsonic state is necessary to explain both the large luminosity ( compared to the wind model prediction ) and the extent of the diffuse x - ray emissions .",
    "even if a bulge wind has the energy to escape the halo virial radius , the wind can be reversely shocked and stalled by the cgm .",
    "when the reverse shock propagates inward within the sonic point , the bulge wind turns into a globally subsonic outflow .",
    "such a subsonic state can be quasi stable for a long time with proper treatment of the boundary the galactic flow @xcite .",
    "a proper 3-d simulation including the entire cgm is possible , though computationally very expensive at present . other effects , which are ignored here for simplicity , can further affect the x - ray luminosity of the galactic bulges .",
    "a vertically collimated bulge wind can be a promising way to significantly boost the x - ray luminosity , particularly for objects such as m31 with a considerable mass in the galactic disk .",
    "motivated by the observed bipolar diffuse x - ray emission in the m31 bulge @xcite , we have found in preliminary simulations that a vertically collimated wind , confined by the surrounding gaseous disk , will have significantly higher x - ray emission ( by up to an order of magnitude ) .",
    "the major reason is that the density diverges much slower in the collimated wind than in the spherical wind .",
    "we plan to address this issue in a separate paper ( tang & wang in preparation ) .",
    "in this work , we have explored the properties of the structured hot gas created by sporadic sn explosions inside a galactic bulge by conducting detailed 3d hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "our main results are as follows :    * a galactic wind may be generated in a galactic bulge with the standard empirical stellar mass loss and type ia sn rate .",
    "the gas properties fluctuate in time particularly in the central region lying within the sonic radius of the wind , where individual sn explosions strongly influence the density and temperature distributions . at larger radii ,",
    "the spherically average profiles of the 3d simulations follow those of the 1d models .",
    "therefore the 1d treatment of a galactic bulge wind flow is a reasonable approximation on large scales . *",
    "sporadic sn explosions produce 3d filamentary and shell - like structures in the gas .",
    "these structures result in broad density and temperature distributions , compared to the 1d model .",
    "furthermore , the relatively low temperature of the structures leads to an emission measure - weighted temperature that is significantly lower than the expected value inferred from the specific heating and has a relatively flat radial distribution throughout the bulge region , consistent with observations . * iron ejected by sne does not mix well with the surrounding gas within the bulge region and has a relatively high temperature and low density , so it contributes primarily to emission in the energy band @xmath80 2kev .",
    "the diffuse soft x - ray emission comes from shells associated with sn blastwaves , which are hardly enriched by sn ejecta and have a metallicity close to the ambient gas that originates in stellar winds .",
    "this , together with the temperature broadening , helps to explain the apparent sub - solar abundance of the soft x - ray - emitting gas in galactic bulges / ellipticals . *",
    "compared with the 1d spherical wind model , the structured hot gas in 3d simulations can boost the x - ray emission in an intermediate energy band ( e.g. , 0.5 - 2.0kev ) by a factor of a few . this increase is more significant at the lower or higher energy bands due to the broad distributions of both temperature and density . in order to produce the luminosity and surface brightness distribution similar to the observed diffuse x - ray emission",
