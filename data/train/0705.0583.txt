    "in the early 1970 s , in the course of observations of rapid variability of the optical spectrum of the seyfert galaxy ngc  4151 , the time lag of variations in the h@xmath0 line with respect to variations in the optical continuum was discovered @xcite .",
    "the time lag was interpreted by @xcite as a consequence of the fact that the emission - line clouds are at some distance from the ionizing radiation source .",
    "later on , @xcite observed much smaller time lags in variations of the h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 lines .",
    "such a difference in the time lag , in h@xmath0 greater than in h@xmath1 , is observed in other active galactic nuclei ( agn ) as well ( see table  6 in @xcite ) . according to @xcite , this difference in time",
    "lag is due to an essential nonlinearity in the dependence of the h@xmath0 luminosity of an individual cloud upon the ionizing continuum flux incident on the cloud , the dependence in the higher order balmer lines being close to linear .",
    "this explanation was made with the assumption that the duration of the emission - line flare is much greater than the duration of the flare in the ionizing continuum , and the duration of the latter one allows its description by @xmath3-function .",
    "however , continuum variations are not so rapid usually ; therefore , in order to extract physical information from the observed emission - line variations , it is necessary , in addition to theoretical estimates , to use numerical modelling taking into account the timescale of continuum variations .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study theoretically how the nonlinearity in the emission - line luminosity , @xmath4 , of the broad - line region ( blr ) cloud , in its dependence on the ionizing continuum flux , @xmath5 , incident on the cloud , can be taken into account in estimating the blr sizes by means of the `` reverberation '' methods .",
    "we show that the blr size estimates obtained by straightforward cross - correlation of emission - line and continuum light curves can be much ( up to an order of magnitude ) less than those obtained by reverberation modelling .",
    "first of all , we demonstrate this by means of abstract representative numerical cross - correlation and reverberation experiments with model continuum flares and emission - line transfer functions .",
    "then we accomplish practical numerical modelling of the light curves of ngc  4151 in the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 lines on the basis the observational data by @xcite and the theoretical model of the blr by @xcite .",
    "this model is characterized by allowing for thick geometries of the blr , taking into account the anisotropy of line emission of individual clouds and , most important , taking into account the nonlinearity of the `` @xmath4@xmath5 '' relation .",
    "this nonlinearity allows one to explain the differences in the time lags for different lines .",
    "cross - correlation estimates of the blr size are also made .",
    "they turn out to be small in comparison to the estimates obtained by the direct reverberation modelling .",
    "the values of the parameters of the blr model are derived directly from the reverberation modelling , and that is why we do not use any specific numeric results of modern photoionization models of the emission - line spectra of agn .",
    "we use only the fact that , according to these models , the emission - line response of an individual cloud ( particularly , in h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 ) can be nonlinear .",
    "we also allow for a constant emission - line component .    though the presented theoretical inferences on the time lags can be of general interest , our primary goal is to apply them to explaining the time behaviour of the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 lines in the emission - line spectrum of ngc  4151 , in the framework of a simple uniform one - component model . of course , explaining the time behaviour of the whole emission - line spectrum would require much more complicated multi - component models .",
    "the broad - line region ( blr ) of an active galactic nucleus , according to the `` standard model '' , see , e.g. @xcite , represents an aggregate of line - emitting clouds under the effect of ionizing radiation of the central source .",
    "the dependence of the emission - line luminosity @xmath4 of an individual cloud upon the value of the incident ionizing flux @xmath5 , in accordance with the photoionization models of spectra of active galactic nuclei ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , is described by a power law : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 .",
    "the rate of heat input in a gas cloud optically thick in the ionizing continuum is directly proportional to the value of the ionizing flux incident on this cloud .",
    "@xcite noted that therefore the cloud s emission - line luminosity should be , in a first approximation , directly proportional to the ionizing flux ; different lines , however , behave differently .",
    "for example , in the case of l@xmath0 the dependence is somewhat weaker than linear .",
    "the l@xmath0 quanta leaving the cloud are produced in the traditional zone . at the high ionization parameters typical of agns the collisional ionization from the excited levels of hydrogen ( in particular , from the second level ) are effective even in the zone . with increasing ionization",
    "parameter their efficiency grows , and this leads to weakening of the specified dependence @xcite .",
    "so , the emission - line response of an individual cloud can be nonlinear .",
    "this fact was recognized already in the first successful photoionization models . according to them ,",
    "quanta in many lines are produced mainly not in the traditional zone , but deeper , in the so - called `` deep partly ionized zone '' .",
    "successful modelling of stationary optical emission - line spectra of agn requires the following two circumstances to be taken into account @xcite : the power - law shape of the spectrum of ionizing continuum ( i.e. , the fact that the major fraction of ionizing quanta is in the x - ray part of spectrum ) and the big column densities of the clouds emitting in lines .",
    "if the x - ray luminosity of the ionizing source is great enough in comparison with the uv one , the `` deep partly ionized zone '' is formed in the cloud .",
    "taking into account the contribution of this zone increases the luminosity of the cloud in balmer lines , whereas the luminosity in l@xmath0 is stabilized at the level of the luminosity of the zone .",
    "so , the collisional amplification of balmer and paschen lines takes place in the `` deep partly ionized zone '' .",
    "inside this zone the excitation temperatures of these lines increase with optical depth , but ultimately attain some limiting values .",
    "the limiting values are insensitive to variation of the ionizing flux , because the balmer and paschen continua dominate in cooling at such depths @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "when collisional ionization becomes the main source of ionizations and cooling , the rate of cooling increases with increasing electron temperature approximately as @xmath8 . in the standard model by @xcite , @xmath9  k in `` the deep zone '' ; the steep dependence of the rate of cooling on temperature ,",
    "as kwan and krolik noted , provides only weak variation of @xmath10 with depth and insensitivity of @xmath10 to variation of the model parameters , in particular , the ionization parameter .",
    "increasing the ionizing flux makes higher levels of hydrogen attain the limiting excitation temperatures ; the luminosity of the `` deep zone '' in the relevant lines then ceases to react to changes of the ionizing flux , i.e. , in this limit they are constant . in the balmer series ,",
    "the approach to the limiting temperatures affects first of all the h@xmath0 line , then h@xmath1 , and so on .",
    "thus , according to the photoionization models @xcite , the dependence of the cloud s emission - line luminosity on the incident ionizing flux for the h@xmath0 line is weaker than for h@xmath1 , for h@xmath1 is weaker than for h@xmath2 , and so on .    due to the difference between h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 in the value of the @xmath11 parameter , the balmer decrement increases with increasing distance of clouds away from the central source , therefore a photographic blr image ( if such an image could be obtained ) would be larger in h@xmath0 than in h@xmath1 .",
    "a formula for an effective blr radius in a line with an arbitrary @xmath11 value in the homogeneous model of the cloud aggregate was deduced in @xcite .",
    "this effective stratification is explained by differences between emission lines in the degree of nonlinearity of the @xmath12 function .",
    "@xcite showed that within the framework of the homogeneous model of the cloud aggregate , if one takes into account the results of the photoionization calculations of the emission - line spectra of active galactic nuclei @xcite , it is possible to explain the observed time lags and amplitudes of variations in major optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) emission lines in the spectrum of ngc  4151 .",
    "after the first successes of the photoionization computations of the agn emission - line spectra , significant progress was made in this field ; see , e.g. , reviews by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "multi - component models were proposed and studied @xcite , which allowed to reproduce the relative fluxes in high - ionization and low - ionization lines simultaneously .",
    "evidence was found for the presence of optically thin line - emitting gas @xcite .",
    "this progress promoted much deeper understanding of the agn emission - line spectra   it turned out that the uniform models are too simple to reproduce the whole spectra .",
    "however , in what follows , our study concerns only balmer lines .",
    "we aim to explain the time behaviour of the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 lines in the emission - line spectrum of ngc  4151 , in the framework of a simple uniform one - component model . of course",
    ", explaining the behaviour of the emission - line spectrum in total may require much more complicated multi - component models .",
    "effective , not physical , stratification is present in our one - component model , due to the nonlinearity in each cloud s line emission .",
    "the alternative to a homogeneous blr with effective stratification is a physically stratified blr .",
    "investigating variability of the uv lines of ngc  4151 , @xcite offered the blr model consisting of three zones with different physical characteristics ( see table  2 in their article ) .",
    "@xcite proposed a model consisting of two zones ( see table  1 in their article ) .",
    "these models are not considered henceforth ; we adopt the effective stratification picture as implied by the nonlinearity in cloud s line emission .",
    "@xcite offered a procedure to recover the blr structure by analysis of line and continuum lightcurves .",
    "this is the so - called method of `` reverberation mapping '' .",
    "its essence consists in the following : the observed light curve in a line is supposed to represent a convolution of two curves : the transfer function describing physical characteristics and the geometry of the blr and the light curve in ionizing continuum .",
    "the emission - line luminosity of an individual cloud was supposed to depend linearly on the incident ionizing flux .",
    "@xcite found necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a time lag of a maximum of an emission - line flare in relation to a ( short duration ) continuum flare when the blr structure is isotropic with respect to the central source ; these conditions are : the typical cloud should emit in the line mainly from the side facing the central source , and , either a central cavity should be effectively present in blr , or the @xmath11 parameter in the formula @xmath13 should be less than one . these conditions set useful reference points for our modelling . in the 1990 s the effect of nonlinear response as well as of anisotropy of the individual cloud emission in specific blr models , as applied to the cross - correlation analysis , was studied in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we adopt the homogeneous model of the cloud aggregate @xcite .",
    "the effective blr radius @xmath14 is defined by screening of the peripheral part of the aggregate by the clouds situated closer to its centre : @xmath15 , where @xmath16  [ @xmath17 is the mean geometrical cloud section orthogonal to direction to the central source , @xmath18  [ @xmath19 is the cloud concentration ( number of clouds in a unit volume ) . generally , the blr can contain a central cloud - free cavity of radius @xmath20 .",
    "let us remark that the balmer quanta , unlike the ionizing quanta , can leave the blr freely even at large cloud - covering factors of the `` sky '' of the central source , because the dispersion of the cloud velocities in the blr is assumed to be great ; the latter fact is testified by the large width of the observed emission lines .",
    "the model of a homogeneous ( outside the central cavity ) distribution of the clouds is equivalent , in what concerns the transfer function form , to a model with zero covering factor but with @xmath21 , an exponential decrease in the cloud concentration with increasing distance from the centre . in both interpretations",
    ", @xmath14 characterizes the blr radius for all lines . in the first case , it is the radius of the `` lit '' zone in the homogeneous aggregate , and in the second case it is the @xmath22-folding scale of the cloud concentration .",
    "we assume that a typical blr cloud represents a flat `` pancake '' emitting lines solely from the side facing the ionizing radiation source , and , what is more , emitting orthotropically .",
    "see discussion in @xcite on the physical basis for this assumption .",
    "the planes of the clouds are either orthogonal to the direction to the central source , or are oriented randomly .",
    "the phase function , describing the phase angle dependence of the cloud s line emission , is different in these two cases . for random orientation ,",
    "the effective phase function ( the phase function of a volume unit containing many clouds ) coincides with the phase function of a spherical cloud , provided @xcite : the cloud is completely opaque in the line , the line quanta are produced at small optical depths , and the cloud surface emits in the line orthotropically .",
    "one should make a reservation that the pancake shaped cloud , as well as a uniform cloud aggregate model itself , is a physical idealization that can be used only as an approximation for the real arrangement of line - emitting material in the blr .",
    "the real structure might be closer to a combination of a disk and an outflowing wind @xcite .",
    "we adopt the pancake shape for the blr cloud exclusively for convenience in mathematical modelling : indeed , according to @xcite , the phase function of the pancake cloud with the plane orthogonal to the ionizing source direction provides the maximum anisotropy of line emission , i.e. , this is a physical limit worth theoretical examination , while the phase function of a spherical cloud ( or , equivalently , randomly oriented pancakes ) gives an approximation for the phase function of randomly oriented optically thick line - emitting material , i.e. , it describes a situation that is expected to be closer to reality .    if the `` pancakes '' are orthogonal to the central source direction , the transfer function representing the dependence of the observed integrated emission - line flux @xmath23 on time @xmath24 counted from the moment of the @xmath25flare of the central source in continuum , is as follows @xcite :    @xmath26    where @xmath27    and @xmath28 , @xmath14 , @xmath20 are measured in the light - travel time units .    in the case",
    "when the planes of clouds are oriented randomly , their mean phase function coincides with the phase function of a spherical cloud .",
    "this function is as follows @xcite :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the `` ionizing source  cloud  observer '' angle , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "general formula  ( 3 ) in @xcite for the transfer function , after substitution of phase function  ( [ pf2 ] ) , becomes :    @xmath33    where @xmath34    transfer functions  ( [ transfer1 ] ) and ( [ transfer2 ] ) can be expressed through incomplete @xmath2 functions .",
    "the behaviour of the transfer functions with different values of the @xmath11 parameter ( while @xmath35 , @xmath36 lt - days ) is demonstrated in fig .",
    "the qualitative difference in the behaviour of the functions with @xmath11 less and greater than unity is clearly seen . in particular ,",

    "since it is the optical continuum , not the ionizing one , that is observed , we use an assumption , formulated below , on a relation between the continua .",
    "a difference of expression  ( [ conv ] ) from those usually used ( valid in the case of the linear `` @xmath4@xmath5 '' relation ; see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) consists in raising of @xmath43 to the power @xmath11 .",
    "let us remark that , according to  ( [ conv ] ) , on taking @xmath45 in the form of @xmath3-function , one gets @xmath46 , i.e. , the dependence for the case of quasi - stationary spectrum ; see @xcite .",
    "techniques for cross - correlation analysis of agn emission - line variability have demonstrated remarkable progress during the last decade .",
    "the methods of calculation of the basic properties of the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) , namely , the lags of the ccf peak and ccf centroid and their uncertainties , were greatly improved ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular , it was realized that the ccf peaks and centroids underestimate the blr size @xcite , and that taking into account the continuum variability time scale is important for correct estimation of the blr size ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider the time lag as determined by means of cross - correlation analysis in the case of nonlinear emission - line response of an individual cloud . in this section ,",
    "we measure the time lag in model numerical experiments and study the dependence of the time lag on the parameters of a model transfer function and duration of the continuum flares .",
    "we consider the case of a single flare of various durations . as the model transfer function",
    "we take eq .",
    "( [ transfer1 ] ) corresponding to the case of the `` pancake '' clouds orthogonal to the central source direction . the central cavity in the blr is set to be absent : @xmath47 .",

    "[ fig2 ] , the model light curve in the continuum ( @xmath54  d ) and the computed emission - line light curve are presented .",
    "the latter curve has been obtained by means of convolution of the light curve in the continuum and the transfer function  ( [ transfer1 ] ) with @xmath55  lt - days , @xmath35 , @xmath56 . in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the normalized cross - correlation function of these curves is plotted .",
    "the shift of the peak of the cross - correlation function is clearly visible ; as determined numerically , @xmath57  d. note that the exponential - like decay of the resulting curves in both plots reflects the radial structure of the line - emitting region , and the rise in the ccf reflects the shape of the continuum flare .",
    "one may argue that the linear response model is just a linearization of the nonlinear response model , and that any blr radius estimate made in the linear response model is therefore an approximation that might be not far from reality .",
    "however , one should take into account , firstly , that the `` equal time - travel '' paraboloidal surface inside the blr covers a whole range of distances from the ionizing source just after the ionizing flare , secondly , that with increasing time after the flare this surface retreats from the source to larger distances .",
    "the slopes of the linearized dependences for individual clouds on the surface vary significantly in both space and time .",
    "the response slopes might be averaged on the surface , but then the change of the averaged slope with time should be taken into account ; the latter is never done in practice .",
    "so , it is not surprising that the nonlinear response model , as compared to the linear one , can give very different quantitative results on the blr radius .",
    "this directly follows from the qualitative differences in the response function for different values of the @xmath11 parameter , as seen in fig .",
    "a vivid manifestation of the insufficiency of the linearized response model is that increasing the time lag value in the nonlinear response model can be achieved either by increasing the blr radius or by specific increasing the response nonlinearity , namely , by decreasing the @xmath11 parameter value in relation to unity ( see relation  ( [ deltat ] ) ) , while in the linear response model only the blr radius can be varied .",
    "@xcite obtained an approximate theoretical relation of the time lag of the maximum of the emission - line light curve to the @xmath11 parameter in the homogeneous model of the cloud aggregate with or without a central cavity ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the continuum flare was described by a @xmath3 function .",
    "this relation is as follows :    @xmath59    where the constant @xmath60 depends on the choice of phase function ; @xmath61 in the considered case of clouds with regular orientation . in the case of phase function  ( [ pf2 ] )",
    "one has @xmath62 .    ; @xmath35 ,",
    "@xmath52  d. the straight line segments represent theoretical relations  ( [ deltat]).,title=\"fig:\",width=491 ] +    by examining the shifts of peaks of cross - correlation functions at various values of parameters we can assess how well relation  ( [ deltat ] ) works when the ionizing flare has a finite duration .",
    "consider first how the time lag varies with @xmath11 at fixed @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . the time lag , as defined here , is the value of the distance along the time axis from @xmath37 up to the first maximum of the cross - correlation function ; i.e. , it is @xmath63 .",
    "we do not examine the shift of the centroid of the cross - correlation function here .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 is varied from @xmath64 to @xmath65 with the step of @xmath66 .",
    "the ionizing flare duration is fixed at @xmath52  d. the curves for @xmath67 , 15 and 25  lt - days are plotted . theoretical dependences  ( [ deltat ] ) for @xmath67 , 15 and 25  lt - days and @xmath47 are plotted as straight line segments .",
    "it is clear that the theoretical and numerical estimates of the time lag at such a relatively small duration of the continuum flare are in a good agreement .    ; @xmath35 ,",
    "@xmath52  d.,title=\"fig:\",width=491 ] +    now we consider the dependence of the time lag on the blr radius @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the ionizing flare duration is the same , @xmath52  d. the dependences for @xmath68 and @xmath53 are plotted .",
    "we see that the linear character of theoretical relation  ( [ deltat ] ) , valid for the @xmath25 ionizing flare , is preserved in the case of @xmath68 . in what concerns the @xmath53 case ,",
    "it is completely different . from the viewpoint of relation  ( [ deltat ] ) , this case is degenerate , and the predicted value of @xmath63 is constant ( zero ) . in reality",
    "we observe the `` @xmath69@xmath14 '' relation similar to a logarithmic one .",
    "so , as follows from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and fig .  [ fig4 ] , for @xmath70 the ccf @xmath69 value depends only weakly on @xmath14 .",
    "the cross - correlation peak time lag for @xmath38 is small in comparison with @xmath14 expressed in the light - travel time units .",
    "the difference can reach an order of magnitude . for @xmath71 ,",
    "a similar phenomenon was observed by @xcite for the ccf centroid estimates of the blr size in an isotropic ( with respect to the ionizing source ) model of the line - emitting cloud distribution .",
    "they found that such estimates can be less than the real size of the blr , the difference reaching two times .",
    "this is in accord with our findings .     at various values of duration @xmath50 of the ionizing flare ; @xmath71 , @xmath35.,title=\"fig:\",width=491 ] +    what is the role of the ionizing flare duration in the degenerate case @xmath71 ? the dependences of the time lag on @xmath14 in this case for various fixed values of @xmath50 are plotted in fig .",
    "we see that this role is far greater than that of the blr radius . the observed `` @xmath69@xmath14 '' dependences seem to be logarithmic indeed ; one can verify that , unlike the rational and power - law functions , the functions of the form @xmath72 , where @xmath44 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 are fitting parameters , provide ideal visual description of the observed curves .",
    "note that further work is required to explore how the logarithmic dependence found here is vulnerable to the choice of the ionizing flare shape .    in summary , according to our numerical - experimental findings , the blr radius is only weakly related to the measured @xmath63 value in the mathematically degenerate but observationally most common case of @xmath53 .",
    "the role of the timescale of variability is far greater .",
    "therefore , the lines with @xmath75 are of little help in determining the blr size by means of cross - correlation techniques ; instead , the lines with @xmath11 essentially less than 1 , such as h@xmath0 , should be used for this purpose .",
    "this conclusion has been obtained in a model framework and thus may be model - dependent in some way .",
    "however , it makes clear that there are no general theoretical grounds to believe that @xmath69 is mostly determined by the blr size .",
    "note that solely the ccf peak offset has been examined .",
    "the ccf centroid offset should be examined as well in a future study to check whether it exhibits the same behaviour .",
    "in this section we examine the effect of taking into account the nonlinearity in a cloud s line emission in practical modelling of emission - line variability of an agn .",
    "we model the emission - line variability of the seyfert galaxy ngc  4151 .",
    "the observational data of @xcite on variability of the nucleus of this galaxy in h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 and optical continuum is used .",
    "the observations of @xcite , performed in the framework the agn watch programme , cover the time interval of approximately three months , from 1993 november until 1994 february . while we use the light curve continuum data for the whole time span of the observations , the data on the fluxes in the lines during the first five days and during the last five days of the observational time span are excluded , following the usual practice of eliminating the border effects ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the error bars of the individual observations , defining the weights of the observations , are taken into account in the modelling .",
    "we optimize the model parameters by using a non - linear least - squares method @xcite to minimize @xmath76 , thereby finding best - fit parameter values and their standard errors ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the iterations converge to the same solution for random starting values in ranges specified below , with the deepest minimum of @xmath76 in all cases , though several other local minima exist , as demonstrated below .",
    "we expand the standard errors by the square root of the reduced @xmath76 , because the best - fit reduced @xmath76 is greater than unity in all best - fit models found .",
    "as the transfer functions , we use eqs .",
    "( [ transfer1 ] ) and ( [ transfer2 ] ) .",
    "the best approximation of the computed model light curve to the observed one is found by means of the modelling .",
    "we vary six parameters : the blr radius @xmath14 , the nonlinearity parameters @xmath77 for h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 , the normalizing coefficients @xmath44 for h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 , the flux @xmath78 in the narrow component of h@xmath0 ( on the @xmath79 value for h@xmath1 see below ) .",
    "the radius @xmath20 of the central cavity ( a zone free from line - emitting clouds ) has not been varied because it is already known to be most probably small .",
    "a comparison of the known values of time lags in different balmer lines of ngc  4151 allowed @xcite to conclude that the upper bound of the cavity radius @xmath20 is 45 times less than the effective blr radius .",
    "the deduction that the central cavity is small is in agreement with conclusions by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that the radius of the accretion disc in the centre of the nuclear region is estimated to be equal to @xmath802  lt - days @xcite .",
    "taking into account the uncertainty of this estimate and the uncertainty of the @xmath20 estimates , the probable existence of this component of the nuclear region does not at all contradict the conclusions on the small relative size of the central cavity in the blr .",
    "for the continuum flux we take the flux at the wavelengths of 45604640  ( the `` 4600 '' region ) , because this region corresponds to the shortest wavelengths at which @xcite measured the continuum flux .",
    "the series of the observed values of the continuum flux are recalculated for presentation on the uniform time grid by means of cubic spline interpolation .    the constant contribution to the integrated flux in h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 due to",
    "the narrow components of the lines has been taken into account in the following way .",
    "we set @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the contributions of the narrow components @xmath83 and @xmath84 are connected to each other via the constant balmer decrement @xmath85 .",
    "therefore in the course of searching for the best model it is enough to vary the value of @xmath83 ; the value of @xmath79 is determined via the balmer decrement . for each of the considered cases of orientation of the planes of clouds",
    "we have accomplished the modelling twice , namely , for the two reported values of the balmer decrement in the narrow components : @xmath86 as given in table  1 in @xcite and @xmath87 as given in table  1 in @xcite .",
    "the difference in the observed values of the decrement @xmath88 may reflect either the difficulty in its evaluation or its probable long - term variability .",

    "the model of a homogeneous distribution of clouds implies that the covering factor is close to one , but , as it has been noted above , an interpretation of the adopted model is possible as a model with an exponential decrease of the cloud concentration with distance away from the centre ; then the covering factor can be small .",
    "there are several ways of estimating the blr size . besides the reverberation and cross - correlation methods , discussed above",
    ", there exists a technique based on estimating the ionization parameter from modelling the stationary emission - line spectra of agn . using this technique",
    ", @xcite obtained an estimate of the radius of the blr of ngc  4151 , equal to approximately 16  lt - days . by a similar argument",
    ", @xcite found the inner and outer radii equal to 6 and 40  lt - days in their theoretical model of the blr of this galaxy . at the same time when the photoionization estimate was made by @xcite ,",

    "this reverberation estimation was performed within the framework of the model of a homogeneous isotropic distribution of line - emitting matter around the central ionizing source , on the basis of the observational data of @xcite and @xcite on the time lags in the h@xmath0 line variations .",
    "cross - correlation estimates are usually less than the `` photoionization '' values .",
    "cross - correlation analysis by @xcite ( see also discussion by @xcite ) , accomplished on the basis of their own observational data and the data of @xcite on variability in the lines h@xmath1 and @xmath110 , gave @xmath111  lt - days as the estimate for the radius of the blr of ngc  4151 .",
    "similar cross - correlation estimates of the blr size were recovered by @xcite on the basis of the _ iue _ ( _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ) data on variability of the major uv lines : @xmath112  lt - days .",
    "these values correspond to the peak ccf time lags ; the centroid ones are greater by about two days .",
    "@xcite find similar centroid ccf time lags , @xmath113  d , for the h@xmath1 line .",
    "@xcite note that their cross - correlation estimates of the blr size for ngc  4151 are an order of magnitude less than the typical `` photoionization '' estimates for seyfert galaxies .    by means of cross - correlation analysis of their own data",
    ", @xcite found that the time lag of variations in the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 lines in relation to continuum is 03  d ; thus the cross - correlation estimate of the blr radius is 03  lt - days . according to the modern analysis of these data accomplished by @xcite and @xcite , the value of the cross - correlation time lag for the data of @xcite has no clear - cut statistical bounds .    in total , the cross - correlation estimates of the blr radius of ngc  4151 are all in the range of 06  lt - days .",
    "direct reverberation modelling , in comparison with the cross - correlation analysis , give very different values of @xmath14 similar to the given above `` photoionization '' estimates .",
    "according to the results of @xcite , who carried out reverberation modelling of light curves of ngc  4151 in h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 , the weighted - mean ( by the local emission - line luminosity of clouds ) blr radius @xmath11418  lt - days for the best found model , and the central cavity radius @xmath115  lt - days .",
    "the linear character of the @xmath12 dependence was assumed , as in practically all modern research on this subject .",
    "@xcite numerically recovered the blr transfer functions on the basis of the data of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they obtained the following estimates : @xmath116  lt - days , @xmath117  lt - day .",
    "as mentioned above , the reverberation estimate @xmath118  lt - days was obtained in @xcite .",
    "all these reverberation estimates are in agreement with our reverberation modelling results presented in tables  [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] .",
    "so , the known reverberation estimates of the blr size of ngc  4151 are in agreement with `` photoionization '' estimates , and they all are much greater than the cross - correlation estimates . the strong difference between the blr radii found by reverberation modelling , on one side , and its estimates following from cross - correlation analysis , on the other side , ( 1018  lt - days versus 06  lt - days ) underlines the conditional character of the cross - correlation estimates .",
    "such a difference is no surprise : the size identified as the value of the observed time lag can be much ( an order of magnitude ) less than the true size of the blr in lt - days ( section  [ tlccm ] ) .",
    "for example , if the cloud aggregate is uniform , the time lag of variation of a line with @xmath75 with respect to an ionizing flare is small compared to the blr radius @xmath14 in light travel time units , and depends on @xmath14 only weakly .",
    "the ultimate cause of this phenomenon is the degeneracy of relation  ( [ deltat ] ) at @xmath38 .",
    "this degeneracy means that in practice there are no rigourous theoretical grounds to believe that the @xmath69 value is mostly determined by the blr size , if @xmath69 is calculated for a typical line ( i.e. , a line with @xmath75 ) .     +   +    however , cross - correlation analysis by @xcite of their observational data indicated that the cross - correlation time lag was small not only for h@xmath1 ( the line with @xmath75 presumably ) , but for h@xmath0 as well ( the line with @xmath11 definitely less than one ) . to clarify this point ,",
    "we have examined cross - correlations between the splined curve in continuum and our _ theoretical _ model light curves in h@xmath0 ( presented in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] ; linear trends have been subtracted prior to the analysis ) .",
    "the analysis has shown that the cross - correlation time lag is 03  d , practically equal to the cross - correlation time lag found by @xcite for the observed emission - line light curves ; the computed cross - correlation functions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "so , substitution of the observed emission - line light curve by a theoretical one calculated for a definite value of @xmath14 ( equal to 1114  lt - days ) in the transfer function does not change the cross - correlation estimate of @xmath14 ( 03  lt - days ) .",
    "it is much less than the value adopted as the parameter of the transfer function .",
    "this means that the cross - correlation method may provide inadequate results not only at @xmath75 , but at @xmath119 as well .",
    "the cause is not all - together clear , but one may speculate that it is related to the strong dependence of @xmath63 on the variability time scale ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) and/or to the small amplitudes of variability in this particular set of observational data .",
    "let us underline that , contrary to the cross - correlation analysis , the reverberation modelling turns out to be immune , as we have seen , to these unfavourable conditions , and provides adequate values of @xmath14 .",
    "a hypothesis on possible variability of the blr size of ngc  4151 was put forward by @xcite , @xcite and other researchers on the basis of cross - correlation analysis of optical spectral variability data at different time intervals of observations .",
    "our reverberation modelling of the h@xmath0 light curve data of @xcite gives the value of the blr radius matching the majority of the blr size estimates of other authors .",
    "this removes necessity in any special physical interpretation of the small value of the cross - correlation time lag in h@xmath0 for these light curve data .",
    "in particular , the hypothesis by @xcite that the physical size of the blr at the moment of their observations was an order of magnitude less than usually is not necessitated .",
    "we have studied how the nonlinearity in the `` @xmath4@xmath5 '' relation ( the emission - line luminosity , @xmath4 , of the blr cloud in dependence on the ionizing continuum flux , @xmath5 , incident on the cloud ) can be taken into account in estimating the size of the blr in active galactic nuclei by means of `` reverberation '' methods .",
    "we have shown that the blr size estimates obtained by cross - correlation peaks of emission - line and continuum light curves can be much ( up to an order of magnitude ) less than the values obtained by reverberation modelling .",
    "this has been demonstrated by means of abstract representative numerical cross - correlation and reverberation experiments with model continuum flares and emission - line transfer functions and by means of practical reverberation modelling of the observed emission - line variability of ngc  4151 .",
    "the modelling of the observed light curves of ngc  4151 in h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 has been accomplished on the basis of the observational data by @xcite and the theoretical broad - line region model by @xcite .    in the abstract representative numerical cross - correlation and reverberation experiments with model continuum flares and emission - line transfer functions ,",
    "we have found that the value of the cross - correlation peak time lag @xmath69 for @xmath70 is small in comparison with the blr size @xmath14 expressed in the light - travel time units and depends on @xmath14 only weakly .",
    "we have shown that in the case of @xmath38 the effect of the ionizing flare duration on the @xmath69 value is far greater than that of the blr radius .",
    "in other words , the blr radius has little effect on the measured value of the @xmath63 value in the mathematically degenerate but observationally most common case of @xmath53 ; the role of the timescale of variability is far greater .",
    "therefore , the lines with @xmath75 seem to be of little help in determining the size of the blr by means of estimating the cross - correlation peak time lag .",
    "the presence of a noticeable time lag of variations of ngc  4151 in h@xmath0 @xcite and significantly shorter time lags in other balmer lines @xcite with respect to variations in the optical continuum has been attributed , in agreement with conclusions by @xcite , to the effect of essential nonlinearity in the `` @xmath4@xmath5 '' relation for h@xmath0 .",
    "the low value of the power - law index , @xmath104 , distinguishes this line from the other balmer lines .",
    "the values of the model parameters of the blr of ngc  4151 have been estimated . in particular , estimates of the blr radius have been made .",
    "our reverberation modelling of the emission - line variability based on the observational data by @xcite gives values of the blr radius agreeing with the majority of its known `` reverberation '' and `` photoionization '' estimates .",
    "much smaller @xmath14 values obtained by means of the cross - correlation method have been shown to be an artifact of this method .",
    "the hypothesis by @xcite that the size of the blr of ngc  4151 at the time interval of their observations were an order of magnitude less than usually is not necessitated .",
    "concluding , a power - law emission - line response model and simple spherically symmetric thick geometries of the blr cloud distribution , taken here as a basis for modelling the emission - line agn variability , gives the size of the blr of ngc  4151 equal to 1114  lt - days , with the uncertainty of 58  lt - days .",
    "this agrees satisfactorily with blr size estimates in photoionization models fitting emission line strengths in the mean spectrum of ngc  4151 .",
    "much shorter time lags found in the cross - correlation analysis of the emission - line and continuum light curves of ngc  4151 correspond to the size of a smaller emission - line region that is reverberating .",
