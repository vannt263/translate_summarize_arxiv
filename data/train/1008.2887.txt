    "in contrast to the pion - nucleon interaction , the @xmath0-nucleon interaction at small momenta is attractive and rather strong .",
    "this attraction can be seen from the fact that the @xmath0 threshold ( 1488  mev ) is situated just below the @xmath11 resonance which couples strongly to the @xmath12 channel .",
    "initial calculations by bhalerao and liu@xcite obtained attractive s - wave @xmath12 scattering lengths . with these values , haider and liu@xcite have shown that @xmath0 can be bound in nuclei with a @xmath13 10 .",
    "other groups have also found similar results @xcite .    on the experimental side results",
    "are meager .",
    "the first experiments searching for @xmath0-mesic nuclei at bnl@xcite and lampf@xcite by using a missing - mass technique in the ( @xmath14 ) reaction reached negative or inconclusive results .",
    "later it became clear that the peaks are not necessarily narrow and that a better strategy of searching for @xmath0-nuclei is required .",
    "furthermore , the bnl experiment was in a region far from the recoilless kinematics , so that the cross section is substantially reduced@xcite .",
    "more recently , the existence of @xmath0-mesic @xmath15 was claimed to have been observed in the reaction @xmath16 using the photon beam at mami @xcite .",
    "it has , however , been pointed out@xcite that the data of ref.@xcite does not permit an unambiguous determination of the existence of a @xmath17-bound state . the suggestion that @xmath17 is not bound is also supported by the theoretical studies of refs.@xcite",
    "two different methods have been applied in the search for @xmath0 bound states .",
    "one is the study of @xmath0 production on nuclei and extraction of the @xmath0 nucleus scattering length .",
    "the other is the direct production of the @xmath0 meson in a bound state .",
    "this state is measured via missing mass technique .",
    "the gem collaboration has used both methods , as will be shown in this paper .",
    "according to the watson - migdal theory@xcite , when there is a weak transition to a system where there is a strong final state interaction ( _ fsi _ ) , one can factorize the @xmath18-wave reaction amplitude , @xmath19 , near threshold in the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the @xmath0 c.m . momentum , @xmath22 the complex scattering length and @xmath23 the effective range . the unperturbed production amplitude @xmath24 is assumed to be slowly varying and is often taken to be constant in the near - threshold region .",
    "unitarity demands that the imaginary part of the scattering length be positive , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , to have binding , there must be a pole in the negative energy half - plane , which requires that@xcite @xmath26 finally , in order that the pole lie on the bound- rather than the virtual - state plane , one needs also @xmath27 .",
    "recently , two different experiments at cosy jlich measured @xmath0 production in @xmath28 reactions very close to threshold with an extremely high precision of the data@xcite .",
    "the latter authors folded out the experimental resolution and got @xmath3{\\rm{fm}}$ ] and @xmath29{\\rm{fm}}$ ] for the effective range .",
    "since the data are not sensitive to the sign of the real part of the scattering length , the quest for a bound state or an unbound pole can not be answered .",
    "its value is @xmath30 from the model calculations it is known that binding is more probable for heavier nuclei than for lighter nuclei .",
    "we therefore can expect the relation latexmath:[\\[\\label{equ : relation }    study of the fsi of the @xmath0 @xmath32 system .",
    "this is produced in the reaction @xmath33 the existing data before the gem measurement were not sufficient to extract the s - wave contribution of the cross section . in order to do",
    "so gem made use of a tensor polarized deuteron beam@xcite .",
    "the beam momentum of 2385.5  mev / c corresponds to an excess energy of @xmath34  mev for this reaction when an @xmath0-meson mass of @xmath35  mev/@xmath36 is used  @xcite .",
    "the big karl magnetic spectrograph  @xcite employed for this study is equipped with two sets of multi - wire drift chambers ( mwdc ) for position measurement and thus track reconstruction .",
    "two layers of scintillating hodoscopes , 4.5  m apart , led to a more accurate time - of - flight measurement than previously achieved with big karl .",

    "this is to be contrasted to the lower energy anke results  @xcite , where @xmath41 suffices . from the fit total cross section of @xmath42 nb , where uncertainties in the target thickness , incident flux , and acceptance introduce an additional systematic error of @xmath43  nb .",

    "it seems that the cross sections start to saturate for @xmath0 momenta above 80 mev / c .",
    "the next step is to extract the s - wave part of the total cross section .",
    "for this task the knowledge of polarization observables is necessary .",
    "first the polarization of the beam @xmath44 was measured by measuring elastic backward scattering of the deuterons on protons . from the known analyzing power @xmath45",

    "this yields seven parameters to be fitted",
    ". however , strong correlations were found .",
    "an alternative method is to employ the spin structure of the matrix element . due to the symmetry in the entrance channel three independent scalar amplitudes",
    "are necessary to describe the spin dependence of the reaction : @xmath50 . @xmath51 and @xmath52 have no angular dependence and for @xmath53 we assume the expansion @xmath54 .",
    "fortunately the dependencies can be decoupled @xmath55    we now extract the magnitude of the @xmath18-wave amplitude @xmath56 . from this",
    "we obtain a spin - averaged square of the @xmath18-wave amplitude , @xmath57 through @xmath58 wroska et al.@xcite could not distinguish whether the angular distribution is due to a @xmath59 interference or a @xmath40-wave .",
    "this puzzle can be solved by our result here .",
    "the willis et al.@xcite data for s - wave were extracted from the measurement by just dividing by @xmath60 .",
    "this is , however , not justified in the region of their highest point . assuming a dependence of the @xmath40-waves with @xmath61 we can extract a more correct value for the s - wave strength . from all measurements",

    "more data closer to threshold are necessary to see fsi effects .",
    "the following method was successfully employed in the production of hypernuclei and pionic atoms .",
    "a nucleon is replaced by a hyperon or a pion .",
    "maximal cross section is obtained when the momentum transfer from the projectile to the particle to be implanted is minimized , which means that the produced particle is almost at rest in the laboratory system . in pionic atom studies a proton transfer via the @xmath69 reaction was successfully applied@xcite . however , although this reaction has reasonably large cross section it also has the disadvantage of a huge background due to the break - up of the deuterons .",
    "the resulting protons have the beam velocity and thus the same magnetic rigidity as the @xmath15 particles .",
    "this problem can be overcome by making use of a two - nucleon transfer reaction like @xmath70 but at the expense of a much smaller cross section .",
    "the choice of an odd - odd target nucleus would be ideal in order to avoid nuclear excitations as much as possible .",
    "since there exist no solid material with these properties @xmath71al was chosen as a compromise .",
    "the experiment was done by making use of the following reaction chain : @xmath72 where the @xmath73 carries the beam momentum away .",
    "the unobserved system @xmath6 is therefore at rest .",
    "one of the possibilities is @xmath74 .",
    "since the @xmath0 is also at rest it can undergo a second chain of reactions @xmath75 the final fate of that chain is the decay to a pion and a nucleon . in the case of a neutral resonance",

    "states with binding energies from 0 mev to -30 mev will have momenta below 30 mev / c .    two settings of the spectrograph were used with a large overlap . excellent particle identification in big karl",
    "was achieved by measuring energy loss in the start detector of the tof facility in the focal plane and the tof .",

    ", we test the hypothesis of peak structure being a fluctuation of background , i.e. the origin of the background is taken to be independent of the signal .",
    "the background outside the peak region , for simplicity approximated by a constant , was found to be 5.8@xmath90.64 .",
