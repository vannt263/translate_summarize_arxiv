    "thermonuclear bursts from accreting weakly - magnetized neutron stars provide an excellent opportunity to study emission originating from the stellar surface ( see lewin , van paradijs , & taam 1993 for a review ) .",
    "for instance , the unstable helium burning that produces the bursts may leave asymmetries in the surface brightness of the star that can be observed as pulsations at the stellar spin frequency ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . indeed , oscillations that are apparently produced by bright regions on rapidly rotating neutron stars now have been observed during bursts from ten neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ ; see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "their frequencies range between 270620  hz @xcite , which are consistent with the assumption that these lmxbs are the progenitors of recycled millisecond radio pulsars @xcite .",
    "most importantly , after a small frequency drift is accounted for , the oscillations are extremely coherent .",
    "the oscillations have quality factors @xmath9 during individual bursts ( strohmayer  1996 ; strohmayer & markwardt 1999 , 2002 ; but see muno  2002a ) , and they appear at frequencies that are stable to a few parts in 1000 in bursts observed over several years from any given source @xcite .",
    "the stability and coherence of these oscillations provides compelling evidence that they originate from brightness patterns on rotating neutron stars .",
    "burst oscillations therefore allow one to study a range of questions , including the physics of nuclear burning on the stellar surface , the effects of gravitational self - lensing by the neutron star , and the equation of state of dense nuclear matter .",
    "the most constraining data so far have come from the amplitudes and the profiles of the oscillations .",
    "the fractional rms  amplitudes of the oscillations can be as large as 50% during the first second of a burst @xcite .",
    "if the oscillations result from two antipodal bright regions on the surface , as has been proposed based upon both observational and theoretical considerations ( miller , lamb , & psaltis 1998 ; miller 1999 ) , then amplitudes this large can only be produced if the neutron star is larger than @xmath10 ( miller & lamb 1998 ; nath , strohmayer , & swank 2002 ) , where @xmath11 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "moreover , the profiles of the oscillations are nearly perfectly sinusoidal  the amplitudes of the harmonic components are less than 0.5% of those of the main signals .",
    "this suggests that the patterns forming on the stellar surfaces are either highly symmetric or restricted to near the rotational poles ( muno , zel , & chakrabarty 2002b ) .",
    "the surface velocity of the neutron star ( @xmath12 for a 10 km star spinning at 500  hz ) can be measured from variations in the amplitude and phase of the oscillations as a function of energy , which would provide another constraint on the stellar radius .",
    "the amplitudes of the oscillations should increase as a function of energy because doppler shifts cause the wien tail of the spectral distribution to move in and out of the highest energy bands @xcite .",
    "however , the amplitudes will also be set by the surface temperature distribution , since a finite surface temperature produces a constant background against which a hot region is less distinct at low energies @xcite .",
    "the relative phases of the waveforms as a function of energy , on the other    hand , are affected only by the doppler shifts of the tail of the spectrum , which move the peak of the high - energy pulse to an earlier phase ( braje , romani , & rauche 2000 ; note that doppler beaming and photon arrival time delays also shift the overall phase of the entire pulse ) .",
    "evidence that the hard pulse leads the soft has been reported in a burst oscillation from  by @xcite , although further studies question whether this is due to rotational motion @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present a study of the amplitudes and phases of burst oscillations as a function of photon energy . in section",
    "[ sec : obs ] we analyze the energy - resolved waveforms of 59 oscillations observed with the proportional counter array ( pca ) on _ rxte_. in section  [ sec : mod ] , we present theoretical waveforms produced from the models of @xcite , taking into account the response of the pca to facilitate comparison with the data .",
    "we consider several simple temperature distributions on the neutron star . in section  [ sec : comp ] , we explore whether we can measure doppler effects in the observed waveforms .",
    "as part of an ongoing study of thermonuclear bursts observed with the _ rxte _  proportional counter array ( pca ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we identified 68 x - ray bursts containing millisecond oscillations in data from eight sources that were in the public domain as of september 2001 @xcite .",
    "the pca is composed of five gas - filled proportional counter units ( pcus ) that are sensitive to x - rays between 2.560  kev with an energy resolution of about 15% .",
    "between 2 and 5 pcus were active during the observations in our sample .",
    "each pcu has an effective area of 1200 @xmath13 and is capable of recording photon arrival times with microsecond time resolution . for most of the observations ,",
    "data with both @xmath14  s ( 122 @xmath7s ) time resolution and between 864 energy channels were recorded on an event - by - event basis , and were used to study the profiles of the oscillations .",
    "we first modeled the frequency evolution of the oscillations observed in the entire pca bandpass using a phase connection technique similar to that used in pulsar timing @xcite . to implement this technique , we folded the data in short intervals ( 0.250.5 s ) using a trial phase model , which was then refined through a least @xmath15 fit to the residuals .",
    "this provides excellent frequency resolution and a statistical measure of how well the model reproduces the data .",
    "we have previously used the resulting phase models to study the frequency evolution , amplitudes , and profiles of the burst oscillations @xcite .",
    "we then applied the best - fit phase models to produce folded profiles in 7 energy channels . since the gains of the proportional counters have been changed several times during the mission , the energies corresponding to the detector channels vary . data with sufficient energy and time resolution were only used to record burst oscillations in gain epochs 3 ( 1996 april 15 through 1999 march 22 ) , 4 ( 1999 march 22 through 2000 may 13 ) , and 5 ( 2000 may 13 to present ) .",
    "we were unable to choose detector channels with identical energy boundaries in different gain epochs , since the high time resolution data were usually taken with too few energy channels .",
    "therefore , we defined the energy boundaries by detector channels 5 , 13 , 18 , 28 , 36 , and 53 .",
    "these boundaries roughly correspond to @xmath162 , 5 , 7 , 10 , 13 , and @xmath1720  kev during gain epoch 3 ( see also table  [ tab : ebounds ] ) .",
    "the low ( @xmath18  kev ) and high ( @xmath19  kev ) energy channels generally were dominated by background events , and were therefore ignored during our analysis .",
    "we found that 51 oscillation trains from 6 sources were sampled with adequate time and energy resolution for this study .",
    "the sources , oscillation frequencies , and numbers of oscillations examined are listed in table  [ tab : sum ] .",
    "we note that the energy - resolved data that we used ( table  [ tab : sum ] ) contained up to 30% fewer counts than the profiles created for a single energy channel in @xcite .",
    "this is because the _ rxte _  data buffers could only record energy - resolved data for a fraction of each second before they were filled during the brightest segments of many bursts .",
    "other modes designed specifically to record bursts were available for producing the frequency models ( so - called burst - catcher modes ) , but sacrificed energy resolution in favor of high time resolution .",
    "the burst - catcher modes were not used to produce energy - resolved waveforms .",
    "we measured the amplitudes of the oscillations as a function of energy by computing a fourier power spectrum of the folded profiles in units of total counts per phase bin .",
    "we normalized the power according to @xcite , so that the fractional rms  amplitude at any multiple of the oscillation frequency is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the power at the @xmath22th bin of the fourier spectrum , @xmath23 is the total number of counts in the profile , and @xmath24 is the estimated number of background counts in the profile .",
    "the background was taken to be the persistent emission during the 15 s prior to the burst .",
    "this equation is valid so long as the phase and frequency of the oscillation is known , as it is by design for our folded profiles .",
    "uncertainties and upper limits on the amplitudes are computed taking into account the distribution of powers from poisson noise in the spectrum , using the algorithm in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "we measured the phases of the oscillations by linear least - squares fits of sinusoids to the folded profiles .",
    "the uncertainties on the phases were determined from the diagonal values of the covariance matrices that were derived as part of the least - squares algorithm @xcite .",
    "we also summed the energy - resolved profiles for all of the oscillations that occurred during an individual gain epoch from each source ( table  [ tab : sum ] ) .",
    "although the gain of the pca drifted even during a single epoch , we confirmed that the drift was not large enough to affect the summed profiles .",
    "we did so by folding a set of simulated profiles ( see section  [ sec : mod ] ) through different responses generated by the ftool that spanned gain epoch 3 , measuring the amplitude and phase of each individual oscillation , and comparing it to those of the summed profile .",
    "the values were identical to within less than 1% .",
    "first , in order to determine whether the oscillation amplitudes in individual bursts change significantly as a function of photon energy , we calculated the @xmath15 statistic under the assumption that the amplitudes are constant : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the fractional rms  amplitude in each energy band , @xmath27 is the mean amplitude , and @xmath28 is the uncertainty derived according to the method of @xcite .",
    "we find that 34 of 51 oscillations are inconsistent with a constant amplitude as a function of energy at the 90% confidence level .",
    "the remaining oscillations that appear to have constant amplitudes typically have fewer counts in the folded profile : the mean number of counts in a folded profile is @xmath29 , while those with constant amplitudes have on average @xmath30 counts .    to quantify how the amplitude varies with energy in these oscillations , we fit them with a linear function using a least - squares technique .",
    "a linear fit is only a crude approximation to the functional form expected from a hot region on a rotating neutron star ( see section  [ sec : mod ] ) , but it is adequate for making simple quantitative comparisons between our observational and theoretical results , given the limited statistics in most of our measurements .",
    "we found that 28 oscillations were consistent with a linear increase in amplitude as a function of energy .",
    "the average of the best - fit slopes for these oscillations was 0.8% kev@xmath0 .",
    "the smallest total detectable increase in amplitude was about 2% between the 2  kev and 20  kev bands , while the increase was as large as 30% in several oscillations from  and .",
    "only 6 oscillations were inconsistent with both constant amplitudes and linear trends .",
    "two of these ( occurring on 1996 december 21 17:30:34 and 1999 june 21 19:13:02 from , where these and all subsequent times are in barycentric dynamical time ) exhibit random variations in amplitude , while the remaining four ( occurring on 2000 june 15 05:13:02 and 2000 august 9 09:00:34 from , and on 1997 september 20 10:08:27 and 1999 august 19 12:13:22 from ) show deviations from a linear trend that are consistent    with the functional form expected from a hot region on a rotating neutron star ( see section  [ sec : mod ] ) .",
    "we then performed the same analysis for 9 summed pulse profiles from 6 sources .",
    "we list the results in table  [ tab : ampve ] , and we display the amplitude as a function of energy in figure  [ fig : ampve ] .",
    "the amplitudes from all of the summed profiles increase as a function of energy with @xmath31% confidence . in most cases ,",
    "the increase is consistent with linear functions with slopes between 0.50.8% kev@xmath0 .",
    "this translates to a total increase in amplitude from 516% between 220  kev .",
    "only the oscillations from  in gain epoch 5 are inconsistent with a linear trend .",
    "these have a higher amplitude in the 25  kev band than would be expected from extrapolating the trend at higher energies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ampve ] ) , but are still roughly consistent with the functional form expected from a hot spot .",
    "we then examined the relative phases of the oscillations as a function of energy .",
    "the reference phases were taken to be those of the oscillations in the total 260  kev bandpass .",
    "an increasing value of the phase lag indicates that the pulse seen at high energies arrives later than ( lags ) that at low energies . of the individual oscillation trains , we find that only 13 exhibit phases that vary as a function of energy at the 90% confidence level .",
    "of these 13 oscillations , 6 appear to change in phase with a slope of @xmath32 to @xmath33 cycles kev@xmath0 ( 1999 april 29 01:49:24 from ; 1999 april 10 09:54:12 from ; 1999 february 22 04:54:01 from ; 1999 august 19 15:50:57 from ; and 1996 july 14 04:23:45 and 1999 february 26 17:10:56 from ) .",
    "seven oscillations are not well - fit by linear trends , but exhibit random variations in phase as a function of energy ( 2000 august 9 01:22:23 and 09:00:34 from ; 1997 july 26 09:09:11 from ; 1997 september 21 18:10:31 , 1997",
    "september 27 11:17:45 , 1999 january 31 21:56:41 , and 1999 august 19 12:13:22 from ) .",
    "the weighted average of the phase lag for the 44 oscillations that can be adequately fit with a linear trend is @xmath34 cycles kev@xmath0 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : phave ] we plot the phase as a function of energy for 9 summed profiles from 6 sources , and in table  [ tab : phave ] we compile the results . applying the @xmath15 statistic to the data , we find that the phase varies as a function of energy at the 90% confidence level in 5 of the 9 oscillations . in 4 of these 5 oscillations , the phases are consistent with a linear increase as a function of energy with a slope of between 0.002(1 ) and 0.007(3 ) cycles kev@xmath0 .",
    "thus , the pulses at 20  kev lag behind those at 2  kev by 0.04 - 0.14 cycles , which translates to time delays of 100  @xmath7s ( ) to 200  @xmath7s ( ) . the summed oscillation from  in gain epoch 3 appears to exhibit random variations in phase as a function of energy , as is evident in figure  [ fig : phave ] .",
    "we note that our sample includes the oscillation from aql  x-1 in which @xcite reported that the pulse at high energies _ precedes _ that at low energies in the last half of the oscillation train .",
    "we find that these soft lags are significant only in the interval that was searched , while earlier the oscillation exhibited hard lags ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . over the entire burst , the soft and hard lags cancelled , yielding no net delay between hard and soft photons .",
    "we searched for similar changes in the energy dependence of the phases of other oscillations by dividing the oscillations into two intervals containing an equal number of counts .",
    "we did not find any other significant examples of phase lags switching from positive to negative .",
    "in this section , we examine how the rotation of the neutron star affects the energy dependence of the burst oscillations . to that end , we produce theoretical energy - resolved light curves from circular hot spots on a rotating neutron star .",
    "we use the techniques outlined by pechenick , ftaclas , & cohen ( 1983 ) , @xcite , and weinberg , miller , & lamb ( 2001 ) .",
    "the amplitudes and profiles of our theoretical oscillations in the entire pca bandpass ( 260  kev ) are discussed extensively in @xcite .",
    "the energy spectra observed during bursts can adequately be modeled as blackbody emission with a temperature @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , we use the same spectral distribution to describe the emission from the neutron star s surface . the angular dependence of the emission is described by a hopf function @xcite , which is appropriate for the scattering - dominated atmosphere present during a burst ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "photons are propagated to the observer through a schwarzschild metric about a compact object with compactness @xmath36 .",
    "corrections to the metric due to the unknown density structure of the neutron star should be of order a few percent ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is of the same magnitude as the measurement uncertainties in the observed waveforms .",
    "we assume that the neutron star has a mass of 1.4 , and denote its rotation frequency with @xmath37 .",
    "we consider one single and two antipodal circular bright regions with a constant temperature , with the rest of the surface taken to emit at a lower temperature .",
    "the circular hot region(s ) are taken to have angular radius @xmath38 and to be centered at an angle @xmath39 from the rotational axis of the neutron star .",
    "the angle between the line - of - sight of the observer and the spin axis of the neutron star is denoted    by @xmath40 . in total ,",
    "our simulations include seven parameters that can affect the energy dependence of the oscillations : the compactness and the spin frequency of the neutron star ; the number , size , position , and temperature contrast of the hot regions ; and the viewing angle of the observer .    for each set of parameters , we produce light curves in 40 phase bins and in 64 energy bins logarithmically spaced between 0.0125  kev .",
    "the observed spectrum is simply a sum of blackbodies whose temperatures are multiplied by doppler factors ; therefore , the signal from a bright region of arbitrary temperature can be obtained by rescaling from a calculation with @xmath41  kev . for each phase , the resulting spectra are folded through a fiducial pca response matrix , which we generated for pcu 2 during december 1999 ( gain epoch 3 ) , in order to obtain predicted light curves that can be compared directly to the observations .",
    "we analyze these light curves in the seven energy    channels used in section  [ sec : obs ] , using the same fourier techniques to measure the amplitudes of the oscillations , and a least - squares fit to measure the phases .",
    "the amplitudes and phases we report are measured for the fourier component at the spin frequency of the star when one hot spot is modeled , and at twice the spin frequency when two antipodal spots are modeled .      in figure",
    "[ fig : edep ] we show the effects of the rotation of the neutron star on the energy - dependent profiles of the oscillations ( _ top panel _ ) , and on the corresponding amplitudes ( _ middle panel _ ) and phases ( _ bottom panel _ ) from a single circular bright region of temperature @xmath42  kev at infinity . here",
    ", the bright region covers half the star ( @xmath43 ) , is centered at the equator ( @xmath44 ) , and is viewed along the equator ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the star has a compactness @xmath46 and spin @xmath47  hz .",
    "stellar rotation introduces two main effects : the fractional amplitudes are larger in the higher energy bands , and the pulses at higher energies precede those at lower energies ( _ top panel _ of fig .",
    "[ fig : edep ] ) .",
    "both effects occur because the spectrum is steepest at high energies ( @xmath48  kev ) , so that a slight doppler shift in the apparent photon energy results in a significant change in the flux received .",
    "this not only yields a larger fractional amplitude at @xmath49  kev , but also causes the hard pulse to peak as the spot rotates toward the observer , before the observer sees the largest solid angle from the spot at lower energies .",
    "we quantify the energy dependence in figure  [ fig : edep ] in the same manner as in section  2 , by measuring the fractional rms  amplitudes ( _ middle panel _ ) and phases ( _ bottom panel _ ) of the oscillations in each energy band .",
    "we perform a linear least - squares fit to the middle 5 energy channels ( 220  kev ) from our simulations to determine the slopes of the amplitudes and phases as a function of energy . for the example in figure  [ fig : edep ]",
    ", the amplitude increases by approximately 0.4% kev@xmath0 , while the phases of the higher - energy photons lead those at lower - energy by about @xmath50 cycles kev@xmath0 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : compact ] we display how the amplitudes ( _ top panels _ ) and phases ( _ bottom panels _ ) of the oscillations depend on the spin and compactness of the neutron star .",
    "the left panels illustrate the dependencies for the case of a single bright region , while the right panels illustrate the case of two antipodal regions .",
    "the bright regions have a constant temperature @xmath42  kev at infinity and a size @xmath51 , are located at @xmath44 , and are viewed along @xmath45 .",
    "the rest of the star is assumed to be dark .",
    "we find that the energy dependence of both the amplitudes and phases are considerably stronger when the neutron star is spinning rapidly ( @xmath47  hz ; solid line ) , simply because the doppler shifts are more pronounced .",
    "however , the dependence on compactness in figure  [ fig : compact ] is more complex . at larger compactness , @xmath52",
    ", the magnitudes of the amplitude increase are very similar for one or two bright regions , although the phase lags are about 75% larger from two spots . at small compactness ( @xmath53 ) , the energy dependence of the pulse profiles from one and two bright regions behave quite differently , because the bright region is strongly lensed on the opposite side of the star from the observer @xcite .",
    "the lensing causes the relative phases at which ( _ i _ ) the observer sees the largest solid angle from the emitting region and ( _ ii _ ) the doppler effects are strongest to differ for the fourier components at the spin frequency and its harmonic .",
    "we use @xmath54 throughout the rest of our simulations , which corresponds to a 1.4  star with a 10  km radius .",
    "we also find that as the size @xmath38 of the bright regions increases , the slope of the amplitude as a function of energy decreases monotonically .",
    "this is due to the facts that ( _ i _ ) the amplitudes of the oscillations decrease in general , and ( _ ii _ ) points on the bright regions have a range of velocities with respect to the observer , which damps the magnitude of doppler effects .",
    "the phase lags do not vary as a function of the size of the bright regions , because the phase of the peak of the pulse is not changed by the effective background provided by the regions of a larger spot that are not doppler - shifted .    in figure  [ fig : angles ]",
    ", we illustrate the effects of changing the viewing angle ( @xmath40 ) and position ( @xmath39 ) of one bright region on the energy dependence of the amplitudes and phases . here",
    "we take @xmath43 and @xmath42  kev , and assume that the rest of the star is dark .",
    "the neutron star has @xmath54 and @xmath55  hz .",
    "we find that the slopes of both the phases and amplitudes generally decrease in magnitude as the bright region or the observer are moved closer to the poles , because the relative velocity of the spot and the observer decreases .",
    "the slope of the fractional amplitude as a function of energy decreases more rapidly because the amplitude of the oscillation decreases , just as occurs when the size of the bright region is increased .    as the temperature of the bright regions increases , the slopes of the phase lags and amplitudes",
    "flatten very slightly , because the peak of the energy spectrum moves to higher energies .",
    "however , if the rest of the neutron star    also emits within the bandpass of the detector , the energy dependence of the oscillations can become quite dramatic , as we illustrate in figure  [ fig : tcontrast ] . the slope induced by the temperature contrast is more than five times larger than that produced by doppler motion alone ( i.e. , when @xmath56 ) . at low energies , the cooler regions on the neutron star",
    "contribute a constant background flux to the oscillations , decreasing their fractional amplitude . at high energies ,",
    "where the cool regions of the neutron star contribute little flux , the amplitude of an oscillation is similar to that which one would see if the neutron star were dark .",
    "the largest slope attainable increases as the size of the hot region @xmath38 decreases . on the other hand , the phases of the oscillations are weakly dependent on the temperature contrast from the neutron star , for the same reasons that the phases are not affected greatly by varying the sizes and positions of the bright regions .",
    "thus , the phase lags provide the best measure of the apparent velocity of the bright region .",
    "in all of the burst oscillations , we find that the observed increase in amplitude as a function of photon energy is about 50% larger than is expected from doppler effects alone . in the sources with @xmath57  hz oscillations ,  and , the amplitude increases by up to 0.80.9  %  kev@xmath0 ( see table  [ tab : ampve ] and fig .  [ fig : ampve ] ) , while a single bright region on a star spinning at 600  hz can yield a 0.6  %  kev@xmath0 increase , and two antipodal regions on a star with @xmath55  hz can give rise to a 0.3% kev@xmath0 increase ( fig .",
    "[ fig : compact ] ) .",
    "similarly , the amplitudes of the @xmath58  hz oscillations from  and  increase by 0.50.6%  kev@xmath0 , compared to the 0.2%  kev@xmath0 increase that might be expected from a bright region on a neutron star with @xmath55  hz .",
    "these differences are significant , as our uncertainties on the measured slopes are less than @xmath59%  kev@xmath0 .",
    "it is therefore likely that the observed increase in amplitude as a function of energy occurs because the rest of the neutron star also emits in the the lower energy bands of the pca ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tcontrast ] ) , thus reducing the flux variations at these energies . to estimate the magnitude of the temperature contrast that could produce these oscillations",
    ", we use the constraints on the sizes and locations of bright regions that are consistent with the observed oscillation profiles from @xcite . using the lack of harmonic signals ,",
    "@xcite show that the pulsations can only be produced by ( _ i _ ) a single bright region that covers nearly half the neutron star ( @xmath60 ) , ( _ ii _ ) a single bright region that forms within @xmath61 from the rotational pole , or ( _ iii _ ) two antipodal bright regions that form within a few degrees of the rotational equator @xmath62 .    a single @xmath43 bright region ( case _ i _ )",
    "would produce oscillations with an rms  amplitude of 55% if the rest of the star were dark ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tcontrast ] , _ top panel _ ) .",
    "since the observed amplitudes of the oscillations are 35 times smaller even in the highest energy band , it is necessary to assume that the other half of the neutron star also emits , but at a lower temperature , in order to reproduce the observed oscillations .",
    "a temperature contrast of about 0.15  kev between the two hemispheres would produce oscillations with an amplitude of 510% in the full pca bandpass ( table  1 in muno et al .",
    "2002b ) and an amplitude increase of 0.7% kev@xmath0 ( table  [ tab : ampve ] ) . in cases ( _ ii _ ) and",
    "( _ iii _ ) , on the other hand , the sizes of the spots are not well - constrained , and thus one can reproduce the observed amplitudes with either small hot spots and a small temperature contrast , or with large bright regions and a larger temperature contrast ( compare fig .  [",
    "fig : tcontrast ] with fig .  4 in muno et al .",
    "2002b ) .",
    "finally , we note that the increases in the amplitudes of the burst oscillations as a function of energy are not a generic feature of all coherent pulsations from lmxbs .",
    "the amplitudes of the persistent pulsations from the accretion - powered millisecond x - ray pulsars  and  actually decrease in amplitude between 210  kev .",
    "this suggests that a different emission mechanism or geometry may play a role in the generation of pulsations in these two classes of lmxbs .      as can be seen from table  [ tab : phave ] and figure  [ fig : phave ] , the phase lags observed from all of the combined pulse profiles are consistent either with being constant as a function of energy , or with increasing slightly such that the hard pulse arrives after the soft pulse .",
    "only one set of oscillations , observed from  in gain epoch 5 , is consistent with a negative slope , and in this case an energy - independent phase is also an acceptable fit .",
    "the magnitudes of the phase lags are on order 0.50.1 cycles between 220  kev , which translates to a time delay of @xmath63  @xmath7s for spin frequencies between 300600  hz .",
    "thus , the signs of the observed phase lags are generally opposite the negative phase lags that are expected from doppler effects , although the magnitudes of the lags are comparable . in contrast , the sign of the phase lags observed from the accretion - powered millisecond x - ray pulsars  and   are consistent with those that would be expected from doppler effects , as the pulse at 10  kev is observed to precede that at 2  kev by 200700  @xmath7s @xcite .    to understand the sign of the lags",
    ", we consider whether interactions between photons from the neutron star and material ( _ i _ ) in the accretion disk or ( _ ii _ ) in a hot corona could modify the energy dependence of the phases of the oscillations . in the first case ,",
    "photons that get scattered by the accretion disk can acquire a doppler shift from the motion of the orbiting material .",
    "however , since the disk is most likely to rotate in the same direction as the neutron star , the soft pulse would lag behind the hard @xcite , which is still inconsistent with the data . in the second case",
    ", a corona of hot electrons could induce hard phase lags if they inverse - compton scatter photons from the neutron star to higher energies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , the hard x - rays ( @xmath64  kev ) observed between bursts from neutron star lmxbs are thought to originate from such a corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is not clear whether such a corona also exists during x - ray bursts , so evidence for it must be sought via simultaneous modeling of the burst spectra and the oscillation profiles .",
    "we also note that a hot corona of electrons could reduce the harmonic content of the oscillation profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have examined the energy - dependence in the amplitudes and phases of a sample of 51 burst oscillations using data from the _ rxte _  pca ( table  [ tab : sum ] ) .",
    "we found that the fractional rms  amplitudes of the oscillations increase as a function of energy by 0.25%  kev@xmath0 to 0.9%  kev@xmath0 between 320  kev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ampve ] and table  [ tab : ampve ] ) .",
    "we then modeled the oscillations as flux variations arising from temperature patterns on the surfaces of rapidly rotating neutron stars , and calculated the doppler effects on the energy - resolved light curves . comparing the models with the data",
    ", we found that the observed slope of the energy dependence is generally larger than would be expected from doppler effects alone ( fig .",
    "[ fig : edep ] ) .",
    "however , it can be reproduced by assuming that cooler regions of the neutron star also emit in the low energy bands of the pca ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tcontrast ] ) .",
    "we also found that the high - energy pulses generally lag behind the low - energy pulses in the observed light curves by 0.002(1 ) cycles rad@xmath0 to 0.007(3 ) cycles rad@xmath0 between 320  kev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phave ] and table  [ tab : phave ] ) .",
    "in contrast , doppler effects should cause the high - energy pulses to precede the soft pulses by 0.003 cycles  kev@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : edep ] ) .",
    "hard lags like those observed could conceivably be produced if the signals from the surfaces of these neutron stars are re - processed by scattering in a hot corona of electrons .",
    "however , it is not clear whether such a corona exists during the declines of the thermonuclear bursts that produce these oscillations .",
