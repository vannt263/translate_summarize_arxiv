    "in this paper we consider the behavior of one - dimensional cellular automata acting on a finite cylinder of size @xmath0 .",

    "maximum and minimum of descriptive complexity of the rules produced by iterative applications of an arbitrary rule depend , in principle , on the cylinder size and the generating rule .",
    "it turns out , however , that in the case of additive finite one - dimensional automata , the minimum complexity is reached at the second iteration regardless of the cylinder size and the generating rule .",
    "we show this by introducing a straight - forward rule - independent procedure that yields the results of the second iteration without applying the generating rule twice .",

    "the _ standard length _ of rule @xmath2 for an automaton on the cylinder of size @xmath0 is @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the short notation @xmath10 for a automaton rule on an @xmath0-cylinder means that @xmath2 must be padded with zeroes at its right end until the length of @xmath0 .",
    "the rest of the paper uses the full notation by default .",
    "the states of @xmath9 constitute a boolean cube @xmath1 of dimension @xmath0 .",

    "thus we come to @xmath476 .",
    "so the only rule @xmath2 for that @xmath477 is @xmath478 .    because of the additional @xmath2 in the equation of the last theorem , the calculations become more complicated , but for @xmath423 it is quite doable even by hands . in this way we found the list of all rules of length 6 that have @xmath257 : 0 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 17 , 20 , 21 , 30 , 34 , 39 , 40 , 42 , 51 , 57 , 60 .",
    "so the rules that do not occur in this list and the list of the example  [ ex13a ] have the height 2 , since according to our upper estimation 2 is the upper limit for @xmath423 .",
    "+ of course , this line of criteria can be continued , i.e. one can formulate analogously criteria for @xmath18 to be equal to given a number @xmath94 .",
    "however , the complexity would increase and therefore the computational aspect of these expressions deserves a discussion .    coming to the computational aspect of these results in general ,",
    "let s estimate the complexity of the computation setting by formula @xmath479 .",
    "since we deal with boolean strings , @xmath409 can be calculated for @xmath480 time , where @xmath481 .",
    "therefore in sum to compute all operands of @xmath482 we need no more than @xmath483 of time . also every @xmath65 with @xmath0-long boolean strings",
    "needs no more than @xmath484 time .",
    "therefore we estimate the general time expenses as @xmath485 .",
    "this is comparable with the time one needs to calculate the rank of a @xmath486-matrix with boolean elements . according to [ 1 ] the average value @xmath487 of @xmath196 grows as @xmath488 , i.e. @xmath489 this mean that the method , suggested in theorem  [ the15 ] , to calculate our determinants modulo 2 is more effective in average than the method using rank computation .",
    "anyway , in case of small @xmath196 the suggested method to compute the determinant modulo 2 has the good practical efficiency .",
    "therefore , the results presented by theorems  [ the15],[the14 ] a certain theoretic and computational value .",
    "+       + it is well known with given rule @xmath2 , how to write the system of linear equations s.t .",
    "its solutions are pre - images of @xmath306 .",
    "however to describe the whole basin of @xmath25 we need to solve equation systems of kind @xmath490 .",
    "the next result suggests a single equation , describing @xmath306-basin of @xmath2 .",
    "we recall that @xmath491 is reversion of sequence , and @xmath34 is the cyclic shift to right on one position .",
    "@xmath17 belongs to the basin of @xmath25 in std for @xmath492 .",
    "* proof . *",
    "first of all , as we know , @xmath493 . hence if @xmath494 then ( @xmath17 belongs to the basin of zero@xmath495 ) .",
    "now , all what remain to do is to write the circulant matrix equation @xmath496 in terms of our operations @xmath497 .",
    "for that we pass firstly to @xmath498 , where @xmath499 is the transposed circulant @xmath500 , and then apply @xmath65 instead of the right multiplication of the vector on the matrix .",
    "so @xmath501 present the first column ( row ) of the circulant @xmath502 .",
    "@xmath64 +       + for the next result it is convenient to introduce the operation of @xmath112-compression @xmath503 of given sequence @xmath2 as following .",
    "first of all we pass from @xmath504 $ ] to @xmath505 $ ] . here",
    "0 occupy positions @xmath52 s.t .",
    "the positions @xmath52 which are multiple of @xmath507 are occupied by @xmath508 . at last ,",
    "@xmath509 $ ] .",
    "[ th12 ] @xmath510 , i.e. in other words the determinant modulo 2 of the any rule @xmath2 coincides with the determinant modulo 2 of the result @xmath112-compression applied to @xmath2",
    ".    * proof .",
    "* we suggest two proofs .",
    "\\(i ) let s start from the theorem  [ the15 ] .",
    "it can be reformulated as ( @xmath481 ) : @xmath511 yet , @xmath512 if @xmath341 denotes @xmath513 . on the other side , as we know , all components of @xmath341 which numbers are not divisible by @xmath507 are equal to 0 .",
    "the same is true for @xmath514 . and",
    "according to lemma  [ 3a ] all components with numbers not divisible by @xmath507 of the left side @xmath515 of the equation in the equivalence are 0 .",
    "the following discourse in essence repeats the reduction lemma  [ lem6 ] .",
    "let s pass from @xmath341 to a rule @xmath516 by cancelling all components of @xmath341 that have numbers being not divisible by @xmath273 . clearly , @xmath516 is @xmath112-compression of @xmath2 .",
    "sure , @xmath517 where @xmath518 . due to lemma  [ 3a ]",
    "if @xmath516 is @xmath112-compression of @xmath2 then @xmath519 also can be transformed into @xmath520 that is @xmath112-compression of @xmath409 , and @xmath521 .",
    "therefore the equality @xmath434 is true if and only if @xmath522 is true .",
    "of course , last @xmath459 denote the sequence @xmath523\\in\\frak b^{n'}$ ] .    by theorem  [ the15 ]",
    "the last equality is equivalent @xmath524 .",
    "so , @xmath525 if only @xmath516 is @xmath112-compression of @xmath2 .",
    "\\(ii ) the second proof is based on the classical formula for the determinant of a circulant matrix .    as it s well known determinants of linear operator @xmath35 and every its degree @xmath526 are equal or not equal to 0 simultaneously . for the boolean field and determinants modulo 2",
    "this leads to the possibility to replace equality to 0 with equality . therefore @xmath527 .",
    "if we set @xmath528 then we get @xmath112-compression @xmath503 of @xmath2 .",
    "now we write out the determinant @xmath529 of the circulant matrix , produced by @xmath530 $ ] , using the formula ( 14.312 ) from [ 3 , p.1068 ] : @xmath531 because , @xmath532 if @xmath533 we can write @xmath534 . when @xmath38 runs the list @xmath535 the number @xmath536 runs subsequent roots @xmath537 of degree @xmath538 of 1 .",
    "so we come to @xmath539 where @xmath540 is the determinant of @xmath112-compression @xmath503 . now",
    "the conclusion is obvious .",
    "@xmath64    this theorem can help in case when the compression factor @xmath541 is sufficiently big comparing with @xmath0 .",
