    "this last assumption has been considered for instance in @xcite .",
    "the problem of thermoacoustic tomography has been broadly studied by many authors .",
    "several reconstruction methods have been proposed for homogeneous media @xcite , and also for heterogeneous media @xcite .",
    "see also the reviews @xcite for additional references .",
    "the theoretical analysis of the so - called _ time reversal _ method has gained considerable attention in the past few years , mainly due to the work of stefanov and uhlmann in @xcite . in its initial formulation",
    ", the time reversal technique gives an approximate solution that converges to the exact one as the observation time increases .",
    "the problem of recovering the initial source for optimally short measurement time was solved in @xcite for variable sound speed employing techniques from microlocal analysis .",
    "recently , the focus of the mathematical analysis has been placed on extensions in the following two areas .",
    "first , there is the problem of accounting for attenuating media .",
    "homan in @xcite gave a first extension of stefanov and uhlmann s work in this direction by considering the damped wave equation with sufficiently small damping coefficients for the time reversal method to work .",
    "in the complete data case , those results were extended to more general damping coefficients in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors addressed the tat problem with thermoelastic attenuation .",
    "second , recent publications have addressed the tat problem in enclosed domains to model the interaction of acoustic waves with reflectors and sensors .",
    "the advantages of working with this setting is that it naturally allows to consider partial data and the inverse problem is closely related with boundary control theory .",
    "see for instance @xcite .",
    "this article falls in the first group .",
    "as far as the authors know , the tat inverse problem with attenuation of integral type and variable sound speed has not been fully considered in the literature from an analytical point of view . from a heuristic point of view",
    ", some advances have been made .",
    "for the case of constant wave speed and constant coefficient of attenuation , modgil et al .",
    "@xcite designed a method based on relating the unattenuated wave field to the attenuated wave field via an integral operator and its subsequent inversion using a singular value decomposition .",
    "treeby et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a reconstruction based on time reversal and the @xmath34-space computational method .",
    "attenuation compensation was achieved by separating the absorbing and dispersion terms in the wave equation , and reversing the sign of the absorbing coefficient during the time reversal .",
    "this method was modified in @xcite where the coefficient of attenuation was allowed to vary within the region of interest , but the exponent of the power - law attenuation was still assumed to be constant . however , in some practical settings such as in the presence of bone and soft  tissue , the domain exhibits regions of varying power - law exponents .",
    "an appropriate method needs to be devised to avoid blurring and distortions in the reconstruction .",
    "our work is a step in that direction , where the coefficients @xmath35 and the kernel @xmath36 in ( [ tat0 ] ) are allowed to vary , which effectively accounts for power - law attenuation of spatially varying exponent .",
    "considering attenuation terms of integral type brings some difficulties to the analysis on the propagation of waves .",
    "in particular , the equation is no longer reversible and local in time and consequently it is not possible to use techniques such as tataru s unique continuation to get uniqueness , at least not in a direct way .",
    "moreover , the microlocal properties of this type of integro - differential operators are not well understood .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to exploit the fact that an integral term of the sort considered here only presents a compact perturbation of the differential operator .",
    "this article can be view as a first attempt to understand the tat problem in media with memory / attenuation coefficients that vary in space .",
    "a subsequent step would be to tackle viscoelastic models , and singular kernels as in the standard definition of fractional derivatives .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the next section",
    "we set the framework under which our analysis is based , such as the well - posedness of the direct problem , the energy space of initial conditions and the hypothesis on the attenuation parameters , namely the damping coefficient and the attenuation kernel . in section 3",
    "we prove two uniqueness results .",
    "the first one is a sharp result on uniqueness for the thermoacoustic inverse problem assuming the distance function from the boundary allows us to foliate the interior of the domain by strictly convex surfaces .",
    "in particular we require @xmath37 to be strictly convex .",
    "the second main theorem of this section , which does not require convexity of the boundary , assumes that the sound speed satisfies a frequently used condition related with the convexity of the euclidean spheres in the metric induced by the sound speed .",
