    "the existence of hot ( @xmath9 k ) interstellar medium in our galaxy has been known since the early 1970 s , mainly from two kinds of observations : the soft x - ray background ( sxb ) in the 0.1  1 kev range ( e.g. @xcite ) and uv ovi absorption lines ( e.g. @xcite ) in ob stars .",
    "the sxb in the so - called 1/4 kev band is dominated by the emission from the local bubble with @xmath7})}\\sim 6 $ ] around the sun @xcite . on the other hand , in the 3/4 kev band , where the emission is dominated by and k lines",
    ", the majority of emission comes from hot interstellar medium with @xmath7})}\\sim 6.2 - 6.4 $ ] , which is considered to widely distributed in the galactic disk , the bulge , and the halo ( * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) .",
    "the sxb shows enhancement in a circular region @xmath10 in radius centered at the galactic center .",
    "these are attributed to hot gas in the bulge of our galaxy .",
    "near the galactic plane ( @xmath11 ) , the emission is strongly absorbed by neutral matter . however , there remains emission comparable to that at high latitude in the 3/4 kev band @xcite .",
    "@xcite clearly resolved for the first time the , , and a few other emission lines in the sxb at high latitude ( @xmath12 ) with a rocket - borne microcalorimeter experiment . from the result they estimate that at least 42 % of the soft x - ray background in the energy band that includes the o emission lines comes from thermal emission at @xmath13 and 38 % from unresolved agn .",
    "the origin of the remaining 20 % ( 34% for a 2 @xmath2 upper limit ) is still unknown and could be extragalactic diffuse emission .    the absorption line is considered to represent hot gas at lower temperatures , typically @xmath14 .",
    "the absorption lines observed in 100 extragalactic objects and two halo stars by _ fuse _ are consistent with a picture where the hot gas responsible for the absorption has a patchy distribution but on the average has a plane - parallel exponential distribution with an average midplane density of @xmath15 and a scale height of @xmath16 kpc @xcite .",
    "the average velocity dispersion of absorption lines is @xmath17 with a standard deviation of @xmath18 .    on the other hand , , , , and absorption lines were detected in the energy spectra of bright active galactic nuclei ( agn ) observed with the dispersive spectrometers on board the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observatories .",
    "@xcite . in spite of the fact that the redshift is consistent with 0 , a large fraction of the absorption",
    "is considered to arise from the hot ( @xmath7})}\\sim 6.4 $ ] ) plasma outside our galaxy , i.e. the so - called warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim , @xcite ) . for example , @xcite argued that the scale height of the hot gas should be larger than 140 kpc in order to consistently explain the equivalent width of the absorption line and the intensity of the emission line at the same time .",
    "however , obviously the hot gas in our galaxy contributes to the absorption lines to some extent .    in order to constrain the density and distribution of hot gas which is responsible for and emission in our galaxy , and to constrain its contribution to the sxb and to the agn absorption lines , we searched for absorption lines of highly ionized o in the energy spectra of galactic x - ray sources .    in this paper",
    "we report the first detection of , and absorption lines in the x - ray spectrum of 4u1820303   in the globular cluster ngc6624 observed with the low energy transmission grating ( letg ) on board the _ chandra _ observatory .",
    "we consider that the absorption lines are most likely due to the interstellar medium .",
    "we constrain the temperature and density of the plasma responsible for the absorption and compare the results with the models of the sxb , the agn absorption lines , and the sxb emission lines .    throughout this paper , we quote single parameter errors at the 90  % confidence level unless otherwise specified .",
    "in order to detect interstellar and absorption lines , we need to select an appropriate x - ray lighthouse for the study .",
    "first , the absorption by neutral matter must be small .",
    "we set a criterion , @xmath19 , so that the x - ray transmission at o line energies is larger than 0.2 . on the other hand , a larger ionized o column density",
    "is expected for distant sources , and thus for sources with a large @xmath20 .",
    "thus , we should select sources close to @xmath21 .",
    "sources at a high galactic latitude may be better because a larger column - density ratio of ionized o to neutral h is expected .",
    "finally , we need a bright x - ray source with a featureless x - ray spectrum . according to those criteria , we selected two low mass x - ray binaries , 4u1820303   and cyg x-2 .    in this section",
    "we first describe the analysis and results for 4u1820303   and cyg x-2 . the analysis of the latter will be described only briefly because the analysis of the spectrum near o absorption of the same data set has already been described in detail in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "4u1820303   is a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) located in the globular cluster ngc 6624 at ( @xmath22 , @xmath4 ) = ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) .",
    "the distance of the star cluster is determined from the optical reddening , and the brightness of horizontal - branch and main - sequence turn - off stars @xcite . in this paper",
    "we adopt the value @xmath25 kpc from @xcite .",
    "the authors also state that the peak brightness of x - ray bursts with photospheric expansion is consistent with this distance and the he eddington limit . adopting the distance of 7.6 kpc , 4u1820303",
    "is located 1.0  kpc above the galactic disk . the neutral hydrogen column density towards the source is estimated to be @xmath26 from e(b - v)@xmath27 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the total column density of our galaxy , @xmath28 from 21 cm radio observations @xcite .",
    "4u1820303   was observed with the letg / hrc(high resolution camera)-s for 15.1  ks on march 10 , 2000 ( obsid 98 ) .",
    "we retrieved the archival data from the cxc ( chandra x - ray center ) .",
    "we used the data reprocessed by cxc on january 1 , 2002 .",
    "the ascds version number is 6.5.1 . throughout the present analysis",
    ", we used the software ciao 2.3 with the calibration data in caldb 2.21 .    during the present observation ,",
    "the source exhibited only 2.1 % rms intensity variation on time scales longer than 10 minutes .",
    "thus , we integrated all the data after the standard data screening .",
    "we then summed the spectra of the positive and negative orders , and rebinned to 0.025     bins , and subtracted the background .",
    "the background was only @xmath29 of the source counts in the wavelength region we used in the later analysis .",
    "the spectrum we obtained contains photons not only of the first order dispersion but also of the higher orders .",
    "we subtracted the higher order spectra using the method described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we estimated the statistical errors of the first order spectrum by error propagation .",
    "because of the error propagation , the statistics of the spectral bins are no longer completely independent . however , the increase of the statistical errors after the higher order subtraction is smaller than 1% in the wavelength ranges we use in the following analysis .",
    "we thus treat them as independent in the spectral fitting .    according to the letgs calibration report at the cxc ,",
    "the wavelength calibration of letgs spectra is accurate to 0.02  % .",
    "this is smaller by an order of magnitude than the statistical errors of wavelength determined in the following analyses .              in the observed spectrum of 4u1820303",
    ", we clearly found an absorption line at @xmath30  21.6     ( see figure  [ fig : ovii_ka](c ) ) in addition to the neutral - o absorption structures near @xmath30  23   . from the wavelength ,",
    "the absorption line can be identified as the k@xmath31 resonant line .",
    "we also noticed absorption lines corresponding to k@xmath31 and k@xmath31 ( figure  [ fig : ovii_ka](a)(b ) ) .",
    "we also looked at the wavelength corresponding to k@xmath32 , but the absorption line was not clear .    in order to estimate the centroid wavelength , the intrinsic width , and the equivalent width of the lines , we performed spectral fits .",
    "since we fit a spectrum of relatively narrow wavelength range , we assumed a power - law function with absorption by neutral matter for the continuum spectrum .",
    "we determined the continuum model parameters for ne ( ) and o ( k@xmath31 , k@xmath31 , and k@xmath32 lines ) separately .",
    "the wavelength ranges are respectively 18 to 28    for o and 12 to 14    for ne , excluding the narrow wavelength ranges of the absorption lines : 18.4  19.2  , 21.4  21.8  , and 13.3  13.6  .",
    "we represented the absorption with the tbabs model in the ` sherpa ' program @xcite with the h column density fixed to @xmath33 for ne . for o , we used the model employed by @xcite for cyg x-2 .",
    "we set the o abundance of the tbabs model to zero and represented the o absorption features with three edge models and two absorption lines .",
    "we then determined the absorption line parameters , fitting the spectra in the wavelength ranges shown in table  [ tab : fit_results ] . in these fits",
    ", we fixed the power - law index and the absorption parameters of the continuum to the values obtained in the previous fits .",
    "thus , the free parameters are : the normalization of the continuum , the centroid wavelength , the intrinsic width , and the equivalent width of the absorption line .",
    "we modeled the absorption line by adding a negative gaussian to the continuum .",
    "the best fit parameters of the absorption lines are summarized in table  [ tab : fit_results ] . in the table we expressed the intrinsic width of the line with the @xmath4 parameter , which is related to the gaussian @xmath2 of the fitting model as @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is the velocity of light ) .",
    "thus @xmath4 is related to the temperature as @xmath36 in the case of thermal doppler broadening where @xmath37 are respectively the boltzmann constant , the temperature , and the mass of the ion .    as shown in table",
    "[ tab : fit_results ] , we obtained only an upper limit for the intrinsic width @xmath4 .",
    "the present model gives `` negative x - ray intensity '' in the model photon spectrum when the intrinsic width is narrower than a certain value .",
    "however , even in such cases , the model spectrum convolved with the detector response function is positive and the equivalent width of the line is correctly estimated .",
    "we confirmed this by simulations , generating model spectra using an absorption line with a voigt profile and fitting them with a negative gaussian function .",
    "the difference between the model equivalent width and the best - fit value was less than 3% .",
    "the column densities of ions will be estimated from the equivalent width utilizing the curve - of - growth analysis later .",
    "the centroid wavelengths of three lines are consistent with k@xmath31 , k@xmath31 , and k@xmath31 at zero redshift , respectively .",
    "those lines are statistically significant at the 6.5 , 3.1 , and 4.5 sigma levels .",

    "cyg x-2 is a lmxb located at ( @xmath22 , @xmath4)=(@xmath38 , @xmath39 ) .",
    "the distance is estimated to be 7.2 kpc , which locates the source at 1.4 kpc above the galactic disk .",
    "the neutral hydrogen column density towards the source is @xmath40 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum near the neutral o edge observed with the chandra letg / hrc - i was studied by @xcite .",
    "we used the spectrum and continuum model function in the paper and fitted a narrow wavelength range including the absorption line .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : fit_results ] , we obtained only an upper limit for the absorption line .      in order to constrain the ion column densities , we performed curve of growth analysis ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we adopted the oscillator strength and the transition probability from @xcite for @xmath0 , @xmath6 , and @xmath0 , and from @xcite for @xmath0 . from the analysis",
    ", we obtain the equivalent width of the line as a function of the ion column density and the velocity dispersion . in figure",

    "the error domain and the upper limit of the column density ( @xmath42 ) obtained from @xmath0 and @xmath6 lines do not overlap with each other for @xmath43 , suggesting the velocity dispersion is either as small as the thermal velocity of @xmath44 k or @xmath45 .",
    "we re - determined @xmath42 for @xmath46 , minimizing the sum of the two @xmath47 of the @xmath0 and @xmath6 spectral fits ; @xmath48 where all other spectral parameters were respectively optimized .",
    "the best fit values are plotted in figure  [ fig : column_density ] ( a ) .",
    "they are in the range , @xmath49 .",
    "we searched for ionized o and ne absorption lines in the energy spectra of 4u1820303   and cyg x-2 observed with the _ chandra _ letg .",
    "we detected and and @xmath50 lines for 4u1820303   and determined the equivalent widths and an upper limit on the intrinsic width . from the curve of growth",
    ", we estimated the column densities as functions of the velocity dispersion , @xmath4 . in order to make the equivalent widths of @xmath0 and @xmath6 consistent to each other",
    ", @xmath4 must be either as small as the thermal velocity or @xmath51 .",
    "on the other hand , we obtained only upper limits on absorption lines for cyg x-2 . in this section",
    "we will discuss the physical parameters of hot plasma responsible for the 4u1820303   absorption lines , and the possible distribution of hot plasma in our galaxy .",
    "we first consider the possibility that the absorption lines observed in 4u1820303   are due to photo - ionized plasma associated with the binary system . in such cases ,",
    "the temperature of the plasma can be lower than @xmath52 k. thus , we calculated the curve of growth for zero velocity dispersion to obtain the firm upper limit of the column densities . for , it is @xmath53 . from the observed equivalent widths and the values of oscillator strengths , we find that the column density of is not smaller than that of .",
    "thus , it is natural to assume that is the dominant ionization state of o and that the ionization fraction of is on the order of @xmath54 .",
    "then , assuming the solar abundance , the hydrogen column density of the plasma must be @xmath55 .",
    "4u1820303   is known to be an extremely small system with an orbital period of 685 s. the size of the binary system is smaller than @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "if the plasma is located at a distance @xmath57 from the x - ray star , the ionization parameter is @xmath58 with a luminosity of @xmath59 and @xmath60 cm",
    ". then o will be fully photo - ionized @xcite .",
    "if the companion star is a he white dwarf , the matter in the binary is he rich . in that case , o should be even more ionized because of the smaller number of electrons per nucleon .    since the above estimation is only valid for optically thin plasma without an extra heat source , we ran the numerical simulation code , cloudy96b4 @xcite to estimate the o ionization state for more general cases .",
    "we approximated the radiation spectrum from 4u1820303   with thermal bremsstrahlung of @xmath61 kev .",
    "we calculated for the parameter ranges : @xmath62 , @xmath63  cm , and @xmath64 k , assuming solar abundance .",
    "we also calculated for the cases where 90 % of the h atoms in the above absorption columns are converted to he atoms .",
    "we found from the simulation that the observed and column densities are reproduced only when @xmath65 cm , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 k among all the combinations of parameters we tried .",
    "thus the geometrical size of the plasma must be two orders of magnitude larger than the binary size .",
    "it is not likely that the plasma responsible for the absorption lines is related to the binary system .",
    "we thus consider it to be interstellar in the following discussion .",
    "we can estimate the temperature of the hot medium from the ratio of to column densities , assuming that these absorption lines arise from the same plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "in reality , the hot medium may be multiple plasmas of different temperatures .",
    "thus , the temperature needs be regarded as an `` average '' defined by the - ratio . in figure  [ fig : temperature ] ( a ) , the temperature is plotted as a function of @xmath4 . for the ionization fraction we used the table in @xcite . as to the column density of",
    ", we used the value from the combined @xmath0 and @xmath6 fit for @xmath68 , and the value from @xmath0 for others .",
    "the temperature is restricted to a relatively narrow range of @xmath7})}= 6.0 - 6.3 $ ] .",
    "the temperature range is consistent with the previous temperatures estimated for the sxb emitting plasma @xcite .",
    "given the temperature range , we can restrict the ne to o abundance ratio by further assuming that the ne is in collisional ionization equilibrium with o. we can also estimate the hydrogen column density of the hot plasma , @xmath20(hot ) , assuming solar abundance @xcite for o. in figure  [ fig : temperature ] ( b ) and ( c ) , we show the ne / o abundance ratio in units of the solar ratio and @xmath20(hot ) as functions of @xmath4 . in panel ( c ) , we indicated the neutral @xmath20 with a horizontal broken line . from these plots , we find that if @xmath69 , @xmath20(hot ) is comparable to or even larger than the @xmath20 of neutral medium and that the ne / o abundance ratio must be significantly smaller than the solar value . since both are unlikely , we can exclude small @xmath4 .",
    "thus it is likely that @xmath51 , and we obtain the constraints : @xmath70(hot ) = 19.41  20.21 , @xmath71 = 16.20  16.73 , and @xmath7})}= 6.19 - 6.34 $ ] . dividing the column densities by the distance , we obtain the densities averaged over the volume of the column , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "the hot plasma is likely to have a patchy distribution .",
    "thus the local densities are smaller than the volume average .",
    "the volume filling factor is estimated to be @xmath54 in the solar vicinity , although there are large uncertainties @xcite .",
    "we did not detect an absorption line in cyg x-2 in spite of the distance , @xmath20 , and the galactic latitude which are all similar to those of 4u1820303 .",
    "although the difference in the absorption line equivalent width between cyg x-2 and 4u1820303   is not statistically very significant because the upper limit of the @xmath0 equivalent width of cyg x-2 is higher than the lower boundary of the error domain of 4u1820303 , this may suggest that the average density of the hot plasma is lower for the line of sight of cyg x-2 .",
    "the sxb map observed with rosat shows enhancement in the circular region of @xmath74 radius centered on the galactic center @xcite .",
    "this may explain the higher absorption column density for 4u1820303 . in order to quantitatively",
    "compare our results with the sxb emission , we use the polytropic models of the hot gas constructed by @xcite and @xcite which reproduce the all sky sxb map .",
    "they assumed nonrotating hot gas of polytropic index 5/3 in hydrostatic equilibrium with the galactic potential @xcite .",
    "the model is described by two parameters , the normalization factor of the polytrope @xmath75 and the pressure at the galactic center @xmath76 , or equivalently the temperature @xmath77 and electron density @xmath78 at the galactic center .",
    "@xcite included an additional isotropic component in the model sxb map to explain the surface brightness at high latitudes ( @xmath79 ) , but @xcite did not . by fitting the rosat 3/4 kev all - sky map with the model , @xcite obtained @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which correspond to @xmath82 } ) = 6.92 $ ] and @xmath83 . using these parameter values",
    ", we can calculate the temperature and density of the polytrope plasma at a given location in the galaxy .",

    "we adopt parameters by @xcite in the following estimation .",
    "the model predicts @xmath87 for 4u1820303   and @xmath88 for cyg x-2 .",
    "however , assuming the solar abundance , the column density towards 4u1820303   is expected to be @xmath89 which is @xmath90 % smaller than that of cyg x-2 ( @xmath91 ) .",

    "we thus need to modify the model to explain the column densities .",

    "of course , we need to increase @xmath78 at the same time in order to reproduce the sxb intensity .",

    "thus the model can be made consistent with the present observations . in this parameter range ,",

    "using @xmath57 , we can write @xmath96 from the observations .",
    "this is consistent with the previous estimate of the hot plasma density in the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "now let us compare our results with the agn absorption lines and the high latitude sxb emission lines .",
    "the column densities of for 3c 273 , mkn 421 , and pks 2155 - 304 are respectively estimated to be in the ranges of @xmath97 16.0 16.4 , 15.7  15.9 , 15.7  16.0 assuming the velocity dispersion of @xmath98 km / s and the equivalent widths from @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : cog ] ( c ) ) . then , assuming a vertical exponential distribution and a midplane density at the solar vicinity as estimated above , the scale height is estimated to be @xmath99 kpc .",
    "this suggests that a significant portion of the absorption observed in the agn spectra is of galactic origin .",
    "this scale height is consistent with the polytrope model , which predicts @xmath100 kpc at the solar neighborhood . using the table in spex ver 1.10 ( http://rhea.sron.nl/divisions/hea/spex )",

    "our estimate for the vertical scale height of hot gas is a factor of @xmath105 smaller than the 140 kpc estimated by @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy is due to the difference in the abundance ( 1 solar v.s .",

    "+ in conclusion , the highly ionized o and ne absorption lines observed in 4u1820303   are likely due to hot interstellar medium .",

    "the average densities along the line of sight are @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "the higher column density for 4u1820303   than for cyg x-2 may be connected to the enhancement of the sxb towards the galactic bulge region . using the polytrope model which reproduces the all - sky sxb map",
    ", we corrected for the density gradient along the line of sight and estimated the midplane density at the solar neighborhood . combining this value with the absorption lines observed in the agn we estimated the vertical scale height of hot gas to be in the range , 2  20 kpc .",
    "the intensity of the high latitude sxb emission lines is consistent with these estimations .",
    "thus we suggest that a significant fraction of both the agn absorption lines and the sxb emission lines can be explained by hot gas in our galaxy .",
    "the present result demonstrates that the absorption lines of galactic x - ray sources are a powerful tool for constraining the physical state of the hot interstellar medium . a search for absorption lines in other galactic sources is urged to further constrain the plasma distribution .",

    "<S> we searched for absorption lines of highly ionized o and ne in the energy spectra of two low - mass x - ray binaries , 4u1820303   in the globular cluster ngc6624 and cyg x-2 , observed with the _ chandra _ letg , and detected , and absorption lines for 4u1820303 . </S>",
    "<S> the equivalent width of the @xmath0 line was @xmath1 ev ( 90 % errors ) and the significance was 6.5 @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> absorption lines were not detected for cyg x-2 with a 90 % upper limit on the equivalent width of 1.06 ev for @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic line width was not resolved and an upper limit corresponding to a velocity dispersion of @xmath3 was obtained for the @xmath0 line of 4u1820303 . </S>",
    "<S> the ion column densities were estimated from the curve of growth analysis assuming several different values of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption lines observed in 4u1820303   are likely due to hot interstellar medium , because o will be fully photo - ionized if the absorbing column is located close to the binary system . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity dispersion is restricted to @xmath5 from consistency between @xmath0 and @xmath6 lines , ne / o abundance ratio , and h column density . the average temperature and the density are respectively estimated to be @xmath7})}~= 6.2 - 6.3 $ ] and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference of column densities for the two sources may be connected to the enhancement of the soft x - ray background ( sxb ) towards the galactic bulge region . using the polytrope model of hot gas to account for the sxb we corrected for the density gradient and estimated the midplane density at the solar neighborhood . </S>",
    "<S> the scale height of hot gas is then estimated using the agn absorption lines . </S>",
    "<S> it is suggested that a significant portion of both the agn absorption lines and the high - latitude sxb emission lines can be explained by the hot gas in our galaxy . </S>"
