    "quantum teleportation is an operation that can transport a pure quantum state across arbitrary distances with high fidelity  @xcite .",
    "normally , the process is performed actively by an experimenter  @xcite@xcite@xcite and is a standard element of the growing arsenal of quantum information tools being developed for quantum computing , quantum cryptography , and other emerging quantum technologies  @xcite@xcite@xcite . here",
    ", we explore the effects of spontaneous quantum teleportation using an ising - inspired model in a quenched spin lattice .",
    "that is , the teleportations occur without an active experimental intervention and the quantum correlation process is driven by the natural dynamics of a physical system in thermal equilibrium .",
    "we refer to a quenched lattice as one which fixes the location of all particles and isolated spins in space .",
    "this is in contrast to an annealed lattice which would allow single spins and entangled particle pairs to diffuse and interact in the lattice versus time .",
    "in addition to a lattice of fixed single - particles in @xmath0-component spin eigenstates used in the ising model , all of our quantum correlation models require the presence of entangled pairs of particles known as einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pairs  @xcite . in this context , the spin epr pairs are treated quantum mechanically in the bell basis .",
    "these pairs can be considered to be correlated impurities in an otherwise thermalized spin system . to introduce the epr pairs into the spin system , and to emulate the measurement process",
    ", we consider several models of a quenched lattice and also consider decoherence effects .",
    "after initializing a randomized spin lattice , the fixed spins and epr pairs are allowed to interact at some temperature . like the ising model",
    ", these objects are subjected to a metropolis algorithm that allows their states to fluctuate based on nearest neighbor interactions . however , now there are additional effective interactions that can spontaneously teleport single particle states , teleport entangled pairs , or generate entangled pairs , producing a variety of results .    to isolate the effects of introducing entangled epr pairs and spontaneous teleportation into the system , three cases are studied : pure ising ; ising with teleportation ; and teleportation alone .",
    "the teleportation interaction includes pair swapping , where the teleported state is itself an epr pair , as well as bell state projections , which are local single particle measurements that project non - entangled pairs into entangled states .",
    "the latter case has the effect of generating an epr pair from two single - particle spins .",
    "all of these spontaneous correlations alter the local spin interactions and can serve as a randomized long range interaction that introduces differing degrees of order and disorder , thus affecting various thermodynamic parameters .",
    "these three models are compared with one another in both one and two dimensions .",
    "the decoherence mechanism dilutes the purity of the bell states , driving them into a mixed quantum configuration due to local interactions over a tunable characteristic time scale .",
    "this has the effect of measuring pure two - particle entangled bell states into mixed uncorrelated single particle states of definite spin . in the limit of short decoherence times ,",
    "the system approaches the expected ising quenched lattice results . in the limit of long decoherence times",
    ", the entangled pairs retain their quantum mechanical purity indefinitely .    after reviewing the mechanics of quantum teleportation ,",
    "the ising - inspired models are discussed in some detail for the one- and two - dimensional lattice .",
    "the effects of teleportation on the system are isolated and studied across several thermodynamic observables varied quasi statically versus temperature such as : energy , specific heat , magnetization , and critical temperature .",
    "in addition we study the entanglement density of the system",
    ". limitations of the models are discussed as well as possible future directions .",
    "one remarkable result of quantum mechanics is the existence of entangled particles , particles who s quantum states are entangled , correlated , and dependent on one another .",
    "once two particles are entangled , the quantum correlation and entanglement of states perpetuates over distance . for two spin one half particles , any possible entangled state in which they can reside",
    "can be described in terms of the bell basis , a complete orthonormal basis for a set of two entangled spin one half particles .",
    "the four states , known as the bell states , that comprise the bell basis are    [ eq : bellstates ] @xmath1    where each subscript refers the respective particle  @xcite .",
    "the non - local effects of quantum entanglement can be utilized to transmit quantum states , or quantum information , over distances without physically transferring any particles themselves .",
    "this transmission process is known as quantum teleportation .",
    "the nature of entangled particles and the quantum teleportation process also does not require the sender to have any knowledge of the transmitted state or of the location of the receiver  @xcite .",
    "simple quantum teleportation can be accomplished using a three particle system .",
    "this quantum teleportation process is outlined in fig .",
    "[ fig : qtelf1 ] .",
    "the first particle , particle 1 , resides in the unknown state which is to be teleported , while the other two particles , particles 2 and 3 , are prepared in a bell state .",
    "the unknown state , particle 1 , can be described by @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be complex and satisfy the normalization condition @xmath5 . in order to transmit the unknown state , @xmath6 , of particle 1 to another location , particle 1 and one of the entangled particles , particle 2 ,",
    "must be separated from the other entangled particle , particle 3 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qtelf1 ]",
    ". the location of particle 3 will be the location where the quantum state of particle 1 will be transmitted . to initiate the quantum teleportation process",
    ", a measurement of particles 1 and 2 must be preformed in the bell operator basis .",
    "a measurement of particles 1 and 2 in the bell operator basis will entangle particles 1 and 2 into one of the four bell states given by eqn .",
    "[ eq : bellstates ] . since particles 2 and 3 where previously correlated",
    ", the resulting state of particle 3 , which is in another location , is dependent on which bell state particles 1 and 2 are projected into by the measurement . if particles 2 and 3 initially resided in the singlet state , given by eqn .",
    "[ eq : psi- ] , then expressing the wave function of the entire system in terms of the bell basis of particles 1 and 2 , as is done in  @xcite , reveals that the four possible resulting states of particle 3 are @xmath7    ]    the resulting @xmath8 state corresponds to a simple phase shift of the original unknown state , @xmath6 , while the other three correspond to 180@xmath9 rotations of @xmath6 about the x , y , and z axes .",
    "since the resulting state of particle 3 is correlated to the bell basis measurement result of particles 1 and 2 , the measurement result can be relayed to the location of particle 3 , indicating which unitary operator ( if any ) the receiver must apply to particle 3 to completely reconstruct the original unknown state @xmath6 and complete the teleportation process  @xcite .",
    "the process of quantum teleportation is more rigorously described in  @xcite .",
    "a special case of quantum teleportation occurs when all particles in the system reside in entangled states .",
    "consider a system of four entangled particles , where particles 1 and 2 are entangled in a bell state and particles 3 and 4 are entangled in a separate bell state .",
    "if particles 2 and 3 are then entangled and projected into a bell state , it follows that the particles with which they were previously paired , particles 1 and 4 , will also be entangled and projected into a bell state .",
    "it turns out that no matter what combination of bell states particles 1 and 2 and particles 3 and 4 reside in , if particles 2 and 3 are projected into a bell state the final state of the system will be one of the following four ,    [ eq : pair swap result ] @xmath10    where the resulting entangled states of particles 2 and 3 and particles 1 and 4 are the bell states given in eqn .",
    "[ eq : bellstates ]  @xcite .",
    "thus , eqn .",
    "[ eq : pair swap result ] indicates that whichever bell state particles 2 and 3 are projected into is the same bell state particles 1 and 4 are projected into .",
    "this creation of two new epr pairs causes all four particles in the system to swap entanglement partners and is therefore refereed to as pair , or entanglement , swapping the model discussed in this paper , investigates the thermodynamical effects of a bell state projection interaction in a quenched spin lattice .",
    "a bell state projection interaction or measurement is responsible for both quantum teleportation and pair swapping as well as the creation of entangled epr pairs .",
    "normally , the quantum teleportation process requires a classical channel to complete the operation with 100% fidelity .",
    "that is , the appropriate 180@xmath9 rotation required to finish the process with complete certainty needs to be communicated to the member of the epr pair prepared to receive the unknown state . in our case",
    ", we dispense with the classical channel and allow statistics to determine how the unknown state is transported across the lattice .",
    "as described above , in the standard treatment , the unknown state has complex coefficients @xmath3 and @xmath4 which characterize the state to be teleported . in our case , to simplify the model for this treatment , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are either 0 or 1 .",
    "that is , the unknown states are always @xmath0-component spin eigenstates . as a result ,",
    "up to an overall phase that does not affect the dynamics of the model , the unknown quantum state is always teleported with a 50% fidelity . otherwise , it is the opposite spin state is teleported .",
    "what makes this interesting , regardless of the fidelity , is that a local interaction in one part of the lattice can force the spin state into another part of the lattice .",
    "a random spin state is inserted into the lattice even if it would not be normally energetically favorable to do so .",
    "future models will incorporate a lattice of spin states with arbitrary complex coefficients .",
    "this is equivalent to a lattice of bloch spheres . by retaining all the phase information ,",
    "a richer variety of interactions can be explored .",
    "decoherence could then be modeled using a density matrix approach whereby the state vectors not only reside on the surface of the bloch spheres , but can diffuse into the bulk of the spheres in time due to interactions .",
    "the ising model of a ferromagnet is a simplified model which provides relevant insight into the thermodynamic behavior of a ferromagnet , specifically the spontaneous phase change from a non - magnetic to magnetic state .",
    "the ising model of a ferromagnet consists of a set of spins , and thus magnetic moments , arranged in a regular lattice , usually linear , square , or cubic depending on dimension .",
    "these spins can take one of two values + 1 ( spin up ) or -1 ( spin down ) .",
    "each spin in the lattice is acted upon by its immediate neighbors , where the force is dependent on the relative orientation of the neighboring spins .",
    "aligned spins are favored while anti - aligned spins are not .",
    "since each spin has a magnetic moment , all spins can be acted upon by an external magnetic field as well .",
    "the total energy of the system is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the spin state of the ith spin , @xmath13 is the magnitude of the energy of two neighboring spins , @xmath14 is the magnetic moment of a spin , @xmath15 is the external magnetic field , and the sum over @xmath16 indicates a sum over all neighboring spins  @xcite . the first term in equation  [ eq : tot ising energy ] represents the energy from the interaction between neighboring spins , while the second term represents the energy from each spins interaction with an external magnetic field .",
    "therefore , in the absence of an external magnetic field the energy of the system is @xmath17 where the sum is agin carried over all neighboring spins .",
    "the total magnetization of the system is given by @xmath18 where in this case the sum is carried over all spins .",
    "the ising model holds for any dimension , however the one dimensional ising model does not result in a phase change .",
    "the two and three dimensional ising models do display phase changes . several analytical solutions to the two dimensional ising model",
    "have been completed , two of which can be found in  @xcite  @xcite , however no analytical solution to the three dimensional ising model has been found .",
    "in addition to finding analytical solutions , the ising model can also be investigated through monte carlo algorithms . however , since a lattice of any considerable size has an innumerable number of possible states , it is practical to utilize a monte carlo algorithm with importance sampling , specifically the metropolis algorithm  @xcite . under the metropolis algorithm ,",
    "new random state configurations are generated based on the boltzmann probability @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the energy difference , @xmath21 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath22 is the temperature of the system .    for the ising model , the metropolis algorithm is specifically executed as follows .",
    "a random spin within the lattice is chosen and the energy difference , @xmath20 , that would result from flipping the spin is calculated . if @xmath23 , i.e. , flipping the spin lowers the energy of the system , then the spin is flipped . however , if @xmath24 , then the spin is flipped with the probability given in eqn .",
    "[ eq : metropolis prob ] .",
    "then the thermodynamical quantities , such as energy , for this new configuration can be calculated .",
    "the average of a thermodynamical quantity over all configurations generated at a specific temperature results in that thermodynamical quantities value for that temperature . the model discussed in this paper",
    "is based on the ising model and is therefore investigated under the metropolis algorithm . for comparative purposes this paper presents the results of the ising model in addition to the modified case .",
    "in order to investigate the thermodynamical effects of quantum teleportation in a quenched spin lattice , an ising - inspired model was developed . by directly modifying the ising model to encompass entangled bell states as well as bell state projection and quantum decoherence interactions ,",
    "the quantum teleportation of spin states within the lattice could occur .",
    "the model is structured as a discrete lattice of stationary particles , just as the ising model . however , unlike the ising model , each particle can reside in one of three distinct states , spin up , spin down , or an entangled bell state . just as in the ising model , the spin up state is represented by @xmath25 and the spin down state is represented by @xmath26 .",
    "each particle in an entangled bell state resides in a perfect @xmath27 superposition of a spin up and spin down state , thus the energy between a particle in a bell state and any neighboring particle is the average of the energies given if the bell state particle was in either a spin up or spin down state .",
    "since the average of these two energies is zero , the energy between a particle in a bell state and any neighboring particle is zero .",
    "therefore , any particle residing in a bell state can be represented by @xmath28 .",
    "the total energy of the lattice is still defined as it was for the ising model and is given by eqn .",
    "[ eq : ising energy ] , however the possible values of @xmath12 are now + 1 , -1 , and 0 instead of simply + 1 or -1 .",
    "similarly , the magnetization of the lattice is still defined by eqn .",
    "[ eq : ising magnetization ] with the additional @xmath12 value of zero .",
    "in addition to adding bell states , a bell state projection interaction executed via the metropolis algorithm and a time dependent quantum decoherence interaction were included .",
    "since both of these interactions are dependent of the specific bell state in which an epr pair resides , the specific bell state of all epr pairs is also determined and tracked throughout the model .",
    "the bell state projection interaction projects two particles within the lattice into an entangled bell state .",
    "the projection of two particles into a bell state is the mechanism that is responsible for both quantum teleportation and pair swapping as discussed in section  [ sec : quantum ] .",
    "therefore , the bell state projection interaction may result in the long range teleportation of quantum states within the lattice or in pair swapping . just as with the basic spin flip interaction in the ising model ,",
    "the bell state projection interaction is executed under the metropolis algorithm . under the metropolis algorithm ,",
    "the bell state projection interaction is executed as follows .",
    "two random adjacent particles within the lattice are chosen and the energy difference , @xmath20 , that would result from projecting the two particles into a bell state is calculated . for the case in which the teleportation of a quantum state would result from the interaction , the energy change due to the teleportation of the quantum state",
    "is not considered in @xmath20 , since the exact state teleported is random .",
    "also , it is important to note that @xmath29 in the case of a pair swap because all particles will remain in bell states , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath30 , then the two particles are projected into a bell state , where the specific bell state into which the two particles are projected is random and each bell state is equally probable .",
    "if @xmath31 then the particles are randomly projected into a bell state based on the probability given in equation  [ eq : metropolis prob ] .",
    "again , the specific bell state into which the particles are projected is random where each bell state is equally likely .",
    "when two particles are projected into a bell state there are three possible results , where each result depends on the initial states of the involved particles .",
    "each of the three possible resulting cases is outlined below .",
    "the first and simplest case , case 1 , is the projection of two non - entangled particles into an entangled bell state .",
    "this occurs if both particles involved in the bell state projection interaction reside in either a spin up or spin down state .",
    "a visual representation of a simple bell state projection is show in fig .",
    "[ fig : intf3 ] .",
    "the second and most interesting case , case 2 , is the teleportation of a quantum state .",
    "this occurs when one particle involved in the interaction resides in either a spin up or spin down state and the other resides in one of the four bell states .",
    "considering all possible combinations of the two spin states and the four bell states results in eight possible situations described by the following product state wave functions ,    [ eq : qtel results ] @xmath32\\\\ \\left|\\psi^{\\left(-\\right)}_{23}\\right>\\left|\\downarrow_1\\right>&=&\\frac{1}{2 } \\left[-\\left|\\psi^{\\left(-\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\downarrow_3\\right>-\\left|\\psi^{\\left(+\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\downarrow_3\\right>+\\left| \\phi^{\\left(-\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\uparrow_3\\right>+\\left|\\phi^{\\left(+\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\uparrow_3\\right>\\right]\\\\ \\left|\\psi^{\\left(+\\right)}_{23}\\right>\\left|\\uparrow_1\\right>&=&\\frac{1}{2 } \\left[\\left|\\psi^{\\left(-\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\uparrow_3\\right>+\\left|\\psi^{\\left(+\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\uparrow_3\\right>+\\left|\\phi^{\\left(-\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\downarrow_3\\right>+\\left|\\phi^{\\left(+\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\downarrow_3\\right>\\right]\\\\ \\left|\\psi^{\\left(+\\right)}_{23}\\right>\\left|\\downarrow_1\\right>&=&\\frac{1}{2 } \\left[-\\left|\\psi^{\\left(-\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\downarrow_3\\right>+\\left|\\psi^{\\left(+\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\downarrow_3\\right>-\\left|\\phi^{\\left(-\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\uparrow_3\\right>+\\left|\\phi^{\\left(+\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\uparrow_3\\right>\\right]\\\\ \\left|\\phi^{\\left(-\\right)}_{23}\\right>\\left|\\uparrow_1\\right>&=&\\frac{1}{2 } \\left[-\\left|\\psi^{\\left(-\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\downarrow_3\\right>-\\left|\\psi^{\\left(+\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\downarrow_3\\right>+\\left|\\phi^{\\left(-\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\uparrow_3\\right>+\\left|\\phi^{\\left(+\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\uparrow_3\\right>\\right]\\\\ \\left|\\phi^{\\left(-\\right)}_{23}\\right>\\left|\\downarrow_1\\right>&=&\\frac{1}{2 } \\left[-\\left|\\psi^{\\left(-\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\uparrow_3\\right>+\\left|\\psi^{\\left(+\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\uparrow_3\\right>+\\left|\\phi^{\\left(-\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\downarrow_3\\right>-\\left|\\phi^{\\left(+\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\downarrow_3\\right>\\right]\\\\ \\left|\\phi^{\\left(+\\right)}_{23}\\right>\\left|\\uparrow_1\\right>&=&\\frac{1}{2 } \\left[\\left|\\psi^{\\left(-\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\downarrow_3\\right>+\\left|\\psi^{\\left(+\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\downarrow_3\\right>+\\left|\\phi^{\\left(-\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\uparrow_3\\right>+\\left|\\phi^{\\left(+\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\uparrow_3\\right>\\right]\\\\ \\left|\\phi^{\\left(+\\right)}_{23}\\right>\\left|\\downarrow_1\\right>&=&\\frac{1}{2 } \\left[-\\left|\\psi^{\\left(-\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\uparrow_3\\right>+\\left|\\psi^{\\left(+\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\uparrow_3\\right>-\\left|\\phi^{\\left(-\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\downarrow_3\\right>+\\left|\\phi^{\\left(+\\right)}_{12}\\right>\\left|\\downarrow_3\\right>\\right]\\\\ \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where particles 1 and 2 are involved in the bell state projection interaction , particle 1 initially resides in either a spin up or spin down state , and particles 2 and 3 are initially entangled in one of the four bell states .",
    "equation  [ eq : qtel results ] shows that every spin state , bell state combination results an 50@xmath33 probability that the teleported state , final state of particle 3 , will be spin up and a 50@xmath33 probability that the teleported state will be spin down .",
    "therefore , since the specific spin state that is teleported is random , the teleported state may actually increase the energy of the gas even if the projection of particles 1 and 2 into a bell state lowers the energy .",
    "conversely , the teleported state can also decrease the energy of the gas even though the projections of particles 1 and 2 into a bell state raises the energy . a visual representation of a teleportation",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : intf1 ] .",
    "the third and final case , case 3 , is that of a pair swap .",
    "this occurs when both particles involved in the bell state projection interaction are part of separate entangled bell states .",

    "finally , it is important to note the inherent tendency of the bell state projection interaction to project all particles in the lattice into bell states . since the interaction only projects particles into bell states , as time and iteration number progress , the number of particles in bell states increases .",
    "thus , after many iterations most , if not all , particles will reside in a bell state .",

    "quantum decoherence  @xcite is the process by which a quantum system looses its quantum coherence and devolves into a semi - classical or classical state .",
    "the loss of quantum information which causes the quantum system to devolve is a result of the interaction between the quantum system itself and the environment , which is also treated as a quantum mechanical system .",
    "quantum correlations between the quantum system and the environment allow quantum information to be dispersed throughout the environment .",
    "this dispersion of quantum information increases the entropy of the system .",
    "the quantum decoherence interaction simulates a simplified interaction between a particle in a bell state and its neighboring particles , i.e , local environment .",
    "the interaction between a particle in bell state and its neighbors will cause the particle to disperse quantum information and decohere into the more classical spin up and spin down states .",
    "the dispersion of quantum information is a result of the neighboring particles preforming a measurement on the bell state particle in a pointer basis determined by the orientations of the neighboring particle s spins .",
    "for example , if a majority of the neighboring particles of a bell state are spin up , then the bell state particle decohering into a spin up state will be energetically favorable .",
    "thus , the neighboring particles will `` perform '' an effective measurement on the bell state particle causing it to decohere into a spin up state .",
    "a similar decoherence of the bell state particle to a spin down state would occur if the majority of the neighboring particles were in spin down states .",

    "when a particle in an epr pair decoheres , its partner will also decohere in a correlated manner .",
    "this correlated decoherence will occur in a manner consistent with the bell state in which the two particles were previously entangled .",
    "for example , if a particle residing in either the @xmath37 or @xmath38 state decoheres into a spin up state , its partner will decohere into a spin down state . in the general case ,",
    "when a particle in either the @xmath37 or @xmath38 state decoheres into a spin state , its partner will decohere into the opposite spin state .",
    "conversely , when a particle in either the @xmath39 or @xmath40 state decoheres into a spin state , its partner will decohere into the same spin state .",
    "in addition to the quantum decoherence interaction modeling the quantum mechanical interaction between a particle in a bell state and its local environment , the interaction also mitigates the bell state projection interaction s inherent tendency to project all particles in the system into bell states .",
