    "a decade ago , jarzynski proposed the remarkable relation @xmath1 which interpolates between these extreme cases using nonequilibrium work values @xmath2 obtained from trajectories of finite time transitions between the equilibrium states at temperature @xmath3 ( with boltzmann s constant @xmath4 throughout the paper ) @xcite . this exact relation which holds for any time - dependent",
    "driving described by an external control parameter @xmath5 has been extended to various fluctuation theorems @xcite .",
    "although these ( necessarily irreversible ) finite time transitions occur in nonequilibrium , the equilibrium quantity @xmath0 can be inferred from a sufficient number of trajectories either from computer simulations @xcite or real experiments @xcite",
    ". however , the convergence of the involved exponential average causes problems for far out of equilibirium transitions where the work @xmath2 is substantially larger than the free energy difference @xmath0 @xcite . in this regime ,",

    ", it is hard to imagine how to bias dynamics in real experiments , where , however , apparatus drift may prevent long measurements necessary for thermodynamic integration @xcite and thus render fast growth methods competitive .    both for thermodynamic integration and `` fast growth '' methods employing jarzynski s equality ( or some variant ) ,",
    "efficiency gains can be achieved by optimizing the driving scheme @xmath5 . for thermodynamic integration , where the work @xmath6 is taken as an estimator for @xmath0 , it is obvious that a minimal work gives the best result @xcite . in the case of fast growth methods , the statistics for free energy estimates",

    "we adjust the constant @xmath31 to yield the minimal total work .",

    "there is , however , a subtle difference arising from the presence of inertia terms .",
    "the optimal protocol forces the mean velocity to instantly jump at the beginning of the process from its initial equilibrium value @xmath46 to @xmath47 . at the end of the protocol ,",
    "the optimal strategy consists in setting back the mean velocity to zero @xmath48 . due to the second time derivative in the equation of motion such jumps in the velocity , which require delta functions in the acceleration ,",

    "the benefit of having jumps in the optimal protocol can be understood intuitively as follows . from the perspective of minimal dissipation",
    ", it is obvious that the particle should be dragged at a constant ( mean ) velocity from the beginning rather than being accelerated during a finite time .",
    "this initial jump in the velocity of the particle can only be achieved by a finite initial difference @xmath54 , corresponding to a jump in @xmath55 at @xmath29 . in the present underdamped regime",
    ", a velocity jump corresponds to a jump in the ( mean ) particle momentum which can only be achieved by a delta peak in the force , corresponding to a delta peak in the protocol .",
    "the final jump is harder to grasp intuitively .",
    "in fact , it stems from focussing on the minimal work rather than on the minimal ( mean ) dissipation ( or entropy production ) . if we had searched for the minimal entropy production ( as defined in @xcite ) , we would have found an optimal protocol without a final jump . in the present minimization , at the final time @xmath16",
    ", the particle is still in non - equilibrium with respect to the final potential @xmath56 .",
    "relaxation to equilibrium leads to further dissipation _ after _ time @xmath16",
    "which has , however , already been paid for by the total work since at constant @xmath55 no work is exerted anymore .",
    "a smaller final particle position @xmath57 leads to a longer relaxation time which can decrease the total dissipation of the combined process ( nonequilibrium transition and relaxation ) .",
    "the final delta peak corresponds to setting the final velocity to zero .",
    "this decreases the kinetic energy of the particle and thus is beneficial for a small work .",
    "it also explains the surprising fact that , according to eq .",
    "( [ w * ] ) , we do not have to pay any extra cost for having inertia . during the initial singularity ,",
    "the exerted work is stored in the ( mean ) kinetic energy of the particle .",
    "this contribution is fully recovered during the final singularity where the kinetic energy of the particle is set back to the equilibrium value .      without prior knowledge",
    ", one might have expected a continuous linear protocol @xmath58 to yield the lowest work . in the overdamped limit ,",
    "the work for a linear protocol was at most @xmath59 larger than for the optimal protocol .",
    "we now check how much smaller the value of the optimal work @xmath60 is compared to a linear protocol if we include inertia .",
    "first , we rescale the system in order to compactly write the relevant combination of parameters . with the rescaled mass @xmath61 , the energy scale @xmath62 and a rescaled time @xmath63 ,",
    "the work can be written as @xmath64 , with the optimal work @xmath65 .",
    "in the first case study , only the averaged quantity @xmath73 appeared in the work and thus the same result could have been obtained from a deterministic damped dynamics .",
    "we next examine a second case study where fluctuations are important .",
    "we consider a brownian particle of mass @xmath8 in an optical trap with time dependent stiffness @xmath5 which is driven from an initial value @xmath74 to a final value @xmath75 in a finite time @xmath16 . the time dependent potential @xmath76 leads to the underdamped langevin equations @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the momentum of the particle and the noise @xmath79 has the same properties introduced in the first case study . again",
    "our main goal is to find the protocol for which the corresponding total ( mean ) work @xmath80 is minimal .",

    "these trial protocols show that jumps and delta peak - like singularities can decrease the total work and confirms that our numerical solution of the euler - lagrange equations is the solution of the optimization problem .",

    "it displays initially a delta peak upwards accompanied with a jump @xmath110 and , finally , a delta peak downwards together with another jump @xmath111 .",
    "such discontinuities in the protocol are a consequence of the discontinuities in @xmath93 , @xmath92 and @xmath112 . the first singularity is `` needed '' to suddenly increase @xmath113 from its equilibrium value and also to change the derivative of @xmath114 , which is proportional to the correlation @xmath115 .",

    "in summary , we have calculated optimal protocols yielding the minimal mean work for underdamped langevin dynamics in two different model potentials . surprisingly , these optimal protocols involve jumps and delta peaks at the initial and final times @xmath116 and @xmath16 .",
    "while we have shown that the singularities in the optimal protocol appear for harmonic potential , there is no reason to believe that this feature generically vanishes for anharmonic potentials .",
    "in fact , in the overdamped limit , a recent study has shown that initial and final jumps are also present in a simple anharmonic potential @xcite . at first sight ,",
    "such singularities seem to be unphysical since neither jumps nor delta peaks can be implemented in real experiments .",
    "still our theoretical result is an important insight because it implies that there exists no optimal continuous protocol .",
    "every such protocol could be improved by even steeper gradients mimicking the jumps and delta peaks at the beginning and end .",
    "if there was an experimental constraint on the allowed maximum rate of change in @xmath55 , @xmath117 , the minimal work would still be achieved by a protocol which looks roughly like the optimal one , with the jumps and delta peaks replaced by their best approximation consistent with @xmath117 ( _ e .",

    "thus , it should be possible to exploit our results for real experiments .",
    "our results may also be used in steered md simulations .",
    "even though we here have calculated optimal protocols for underdamped langevin dynamics , there is no reason to believe that other thermostats frequently used in md simulations would yield qualitatively different results for the optimal protocol .",
    "we have neglected memory effects by assuming white noise .",
    "while there are systems for which the underdamped langevin equation is an appropriate physical description @xcite , it might still be interesting to see how our results are altered when considering memory effects .    the optimal protocol for a minimal mean work is not strictly equivalent to a protocol leading to an optimized free energy estimate .",
    "however , it has been found that the latter shares the same features ( jumps at the boundaries ) for overdamped langevin dynamics @xcite .",
    "moreover , the optimal protocol leads to improved estimates of the free energy difference in both of our ( underdamped ) case studies . for case study",
    "i , the work distribution is gaussian @xcite for which it has been shown that the error in the estimate of the free energy difference decreases with decreasing mean work @xcite . in our second case study ,",
    "for which the work distribution is no longer gaussian , the error in the estimate of the free energy difference is indeed lower for the optimal protocol compared to a linear protocol , see fig .",
    "[ fig_df ] and its caption for technical details . for thermodynamic integration , it is obvious that a minimum mean work leads to the best estimate of the free energy difference .",
    "we thus conjecture that appropriate singularities at the boundaries generically improve free energy calculations from either fast growth methods or thermodynamic integration .    for determining the optimal protocol for an unknown potential ,",
    "we envisage an adaptive procedure in which trial protocols ( including estimated singularities ) are successively improved in an iterative fashion guided by the monitored work values .",
    "it might also prove beneficial to use the optimal moving trap protocol ( case study i ) rather than a linear protocol in simulations of ( protein ) pulling experiments .",
