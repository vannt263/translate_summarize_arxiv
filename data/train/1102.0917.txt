    "many extensions of the standard model predict new particles with electroweak ( ewk ) couplings that decay into the sm gauge bosons @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath7 , accompanied by jets .",
    "any production of new heavy particles with quantum numbers conserved by the strong interaction and ewk couplings is likely to contribute to signatures with one or more ewk gauge bosons ; additional jets will always be present at some level from initial - state radiation , and may also be products of cascade decays of new heavy particles . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are backgrounds to most supersymmetry searches in final states with leptons , jets and missing transverse energy .",
    "the @xmath10 signal is an irreducible background to inclusive hadronic searches of dark matter , based on jets and missing energy ( met ) .",
    "w or z + jets is also a major background for higgs searches .    in the context of the sm",
    ", the study of the production of electroweak bosons with @xmath11 allows for tests of perturbative qcd .",
    "the production cross section scales approximately with the strong coupling constant for each additional jet .",
    "while current theoretical predictions at leading order ( lo ) and next to leading order ( nlo ) are in good agreement with data at the tevatron , comparison at the higher energy of the lhc , and at higher jet multiplicities are needed .",
    "inclusive and differential cross sections access the parameters of the perturbative expansion , such as the renormalization and the factorization scales , as well as the parton density functions ( pdfs ) , through the @xmath12 and @xmath13 distributions of the vector bosons and the associated jets .",
    "predicting all these quantities and comparing them to the tevatron data has already produced several improvements in the calculation and generation techniques , such as the introduction of generators based on the lo calculations of matrix - element ( me ) for the associated jet production , and the definition of several matching procedures to the parton - shower generators .    in this paper",
    "we make a comparative study of me+ps monte carlo generators ( @xmath0 and @xmath2 ) with an nlo calculation ( @xmath1 ) , validated with tevatron d0 and cdf data , and generated at the lhc energy .",
    "this will serve as a preparatory mc study of the major sm backgrounds for the regions that are relevant to new physics searches .",
    "the parton shower ( ps ) technique is a collinear approximation of the description of parton splittings in qcd radiation that accompanies hard scattering processes .    however , although it provides a good description of low @xmath14 observables , it usually fails to fill the phase space ( ca nt emit anything above the factorisation scale by construction ) and in the hard region ( close to the factorisation scale ) this approximation is simply no good anymore .",
    "one way to improve the description of kinematical observables is to add a matrix element ( me ) correction for the extra emissions .",
    "this can be implemented in different ways , as will be described in each generator section .",
    "the @xmath0 generator uses the improved ckkw matrix element - parton shower merging [ 1 ] that relies on a separation of the event phase space in two separated regions , defined by a choice of scale . above the chosen scale",
    ", all radiation must be produced by the matrix elements , and below the chosen scale all radiation produced by the parton shower . in matching these two regions to provide full phase space coverage , overlaps such as a parton shower emission in the scale range covered by the matrix element , must be removed [ 2 ] .",
    "the basic steps in the algorithm implementation are [ 2 ] :    * events are generated based on the matrix elements for _ w / z _ + k jets , where k = 0 , ... n. the matrix element jets are required to be above the merging scale , @xmath15 . * the event is then reconstructed back from the final state particles .",
    "particles are combined in the most likely combinations according to the parton shower probabilities .",
    "* events are then passed to the parton shower , which is allowed to generate radiation from any part of the process .",
    "* the shower is then analyzed , and any events in which parton shower produces an emission above the scale @xmath15 are vetoed , leading to a rejection of the full event .",
    "this process is called sudakov rejection .",
    "the @xmath0 generator automatizes the generation of inclusive samples , combining me for different parton multiplicities with ps and hadronization .",
    "some parameters related to the me and ps calculations have to be set accordingly .",
    "the aim of the me corrections in the ps on @xmath2 is to correct for two deficiencies in the shower algorithm : to populate the uncovered region of high @xmath14 in the phase space ( non - soft non - collinear ) , and to correct the populated region , where the extrapolation away from the soft and collinear limits is not perfect .",
    "these corrections are called the hard and soft matrix element corrections respectively [ 3 ] .",
    "the soft correction is derived by comparing the probability density that the @xmath16 resolvable parton is emitted into a region of the phase space in the ps approximation ( quasi - collinear limit ) , and the exact me calculation .",
    "a simple veto algorithm is then be applied to the parton shower to reproduce the matrix element distribution , which relies on there always being more parton shower emissions than matrix element emissions .",
    "this is ensured simply by enhancing the emission probability of the parton shower with a constant factor [ 3 ] .",
    "the correction is applied to the hardest emission so far in the shower , to ensure that the leading order expansion of the shower distribution agrees with the leading order matrix element , and that the hardest ( i.e. furthest from the soft and collinear limits ) emission reproduces it [ 4 ] .      the hard me corrections aim to populate the high @xmath14 region that the ps leaves uncovered .",
    "this domain of the phase space should have radiation distributed according to the exact tree level me for this extra emission , and as the parton shower does not populate this region , a different approach is needed to achieve this .",
    "prior to any showering , the algorithm checks if the required me is available for the hard process .",
    "then , a point is generated in the appropriate region of phase space , with a probability based on a sampling of the integrand .",
    "the differential cross section associated with this point is then calculated and multiplied by a phase space volume factor , giving the event weight .",
    "the emission is accepted if the weight is less than a uniformly distributed random number in the [ 0,1 ] interval , and the momenta of the new parton configuration is processed by the shower as normal [ 3 ] .",
    "both @xmath0 and @xmath2 described above include dominant qcd effects with leading order matrix elements combined with a leading logarithmic parton shower . however , higher order calculations are required to match the precision of current data measurements . going even one step beyond",
    "the leading order is already a complex task : the initial hard process should be implemented in nlo ; and shower development would have to be improved in next to leading logarithmic accuracy in collinear and soft structure . an intermediate step has already been developed : keeping the leading logarithmic order for the shower approximation , while improving the treatment of the hard emission to nlo accuracy ( nlo+ps approach ) .",
    "we test one such generator : @xmath1 .      in the @xmath1 ( positive weight hardest emission generator )",
    "formalism , the generation of the hardest emission is performed first , using full nlo accuracy , and using the @xmath2 parton shower to generate subsequent radiation .",
    "the @xmath1 cross section for the generation of the hardest event has the following properties :    * at large @xmath17 ( momentum of incoming particle ) it coincides with the pqcd cross section up to ( o@xmath18 ) terms . *",
    "it reproduces correctly the value of infrared safe observables at the nlo .",
    "thus , also its integral around the small @xmath17 region has nlo accuracy .",
    "* at small @xmath17 it behaves as well as standard shower monte carlo generators .",
    "the @xmath1 formula can be used as an input to any parton shower program to perform all subsequent ( softer ) showers and hadronization . however , as @xmath17 is used to define the matrix element scale , the parton shower must also be ordered in @xmath14 .",
    "the shower is then initiated with an upper limit on the scale equal to the @xmath17 of the @xmath1 event , and fills in all radiation below that scale ( a truncated shower ) .",
    "for the case of a virtuality or angular ordered shower , emissions at higher @xmath17 may be produced , and must subsequently be vetoed to avoid double counting with the me emission : a vetoed truncated shower , which is not possible with current parton shower programs like @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we point out , however , that the need of vetoed truncated showers is not specific to the @xmath1 method .",
    "it also emerges naturally when interfacing standard matrix element calculations with parton shower . at present",
    ", there is no evidence that the effect of vetoed truncated showers may have any practical importance [ 5 ] .",
    "the @xmath1 method solves the problem of negative event weights that arise in other nlo methods , such as in @xmath21 .",
    "it also defines how the highest @xmath14 emission may be modified to include the logarithmically enhanced effects of soft wide - angle radiation . in the @xmath1 framework ,",
    "positive weight events distributed with nlo accuracy can be showered to resume further logarithmically enhanced corrections by [ 3 ] :    * generating an event according to the @xmath1 formula ; * hadronizing non - radiating events directly ; * mapping the radiative variables parametrizing the emission into the evolution scale , momentum fraction and azimuthal angle , from which the parton shower would reconstruct identical momenta ; * evolve , using the original lo configuration , the leg emitting the extra radiation from the default initial scale , determined by the colour structure of the n - body process , down to the hardest emission scale such that the @xmath14 is less than that of the hardest emission , the radiation is angular - ordered and branchings do not change the flavour of the emitting parton ; * when the evolution scale reaches the hardest emission scale , insert a branching with parameters into the shower ; * from all external legs , generate @xmath14 vetoed showers .",
    "this procedure allows the generation of the truncated shower with only a few changes to the normal @xmath2 shower algorithm [ 3 ] .",
    "the inclusion of matrix elements is only one component of the simulation . in order to describe real data",
    ", other aspects of the generators must also be accurate : the parton shower ( ps ) , and the model of multiple parton interactions ( mpi ) .",
    "the choice of parton distribution function ( pdf ) may also play a role , or at least be highly coupled to the tuning of these phenomenological models .",
    "finally , there are some settings unique to the generators themselves , such as the choice of matching scale between the parton shower and matrix elements .",
    "so , in order to isolate the impact of using lo or nlo matrix elements , we must also constrain all the other aspects of these models .",
    "we use the most recent data from the tevatron experiments , cdf and d0 , to test the generator performance .",
    "the tevatron is a proton anti - proton collider with a center of mass energy @xmath22 = 1.96 tev , located at fermilab , usa .    for each of the analyses , monte carlo events are selected according to the corresponding data selection , described in their papers .",
    "but , in general , the lepton pair invariant mass is required to be between some mass range ( around the _ z _ mass peak ) to enhance the contribution of pure _ z _ exchange over @xmath23 exchange and _ z_/@xmath23 interference terms , and pseudorapidity cuts on the ( cdf or d0 ) detector acceptance .",
    "the generators were configured to produce inclusive _",
    "z_/@xmath23 particles decaying into lepton pairs ( electrons or muons ) , with the invariant mass constraint . also some generator parameters and inputs",
    "are changed in order to obtain the best description of the data : the intrinsic momentum of the partons in the incoming ( anti)protons ( @xmath24 ) , mpi model parameters and the input pdfs .",
    "the comparison plots were made using the @xmath25 framework [ 6 ] , version 1.2.1 .",
    "the @xmath25 project ( robust independent validation of experiment and theory ) allows validation of monte carlo event generators .",
    "it provides a set of experimental standard validated analyses useful for generator validation and tuning , as well as a convenient infrastructure for adding user s own analyses .      the main benefit to using _ z _ events to probe",
    "the underlying process is that the _ z _ can be fully and unambiguously reconstructed .",
    "the _ z _ @xmath14 is generated by the momentum balance against initial state radiation ( isr ) and the primordial / intrinsic @xmath14 of the _ z _ s parent partons in the incoming hadrons . within an event generator , this recoil may be generated by a hard matrix element at high @xmath14 , or by the parton shower or intrinsic momentum of the partons at low @xmath14 .",
    "the inclusive _ z _ @xmath14 is therefore an excellent first test for the generators , before looking at more exclusive _ z _ + jet final states .",
    "we look at three measurements of the _ z _ @xmath14 : the run i measurement by cdf , and two run ii measurements by d0 , in the electron and muon channels .",
