    "recently , interference management in random access networks has attracted a great interest . for an example",
    ", the working group of ieee 802.11 , which is one of the most successful standards in commercial wireless communication systems , is considering performance improvement for overlapping basic service sets ( obss ) under the new standardization called ieee 802.11 high efficiency wireless local area network ( hew )  @xcite .",
    "it is known that obss experiences severe interference and the interference among obss is a primary problem that ieee 802.11 hew should overcome .    on the other hand , interference alignment ( ia )  @xcite has been considered as a promising solution to achieve the optimal degrees - of - freedom  ( dof ) in several interference network models including cellular networks .",
    "suh and tse characterized the dof of the @xmath0-cell uplink cellular network and they proposed an achievable scheme for the optimal dof  @xcite .",
    "the main idea of @xcite is to align the interferences from users in other - cells to predefined interference spaces , and it was shown that the achievable dof increases as the number of users transmitting concurrently increases . to apply ia , global channel state information ( csi )",
    "is required and , hence , some performance degradation may occur as long as there happens csi feedback quantization in practice .",
    "the related performance was analyzed in @xcite along with a further performance optimization .",
    "in addition , opportunistic ia  ( oia ) has been proposed for the @xmath0-cell uplink network in which user scheduling is combined with ia . unlike the original ia technique",
    ", oia does not require global csi , time / frequency expansion , and iterations for beamformer design , thereby resulting in easier implementation  @xcite .",
    "later , @xcite compared oia to the traditional ia with quantized csi and indicated the advance of oia . to further improve the performance of oia , an active alignment transmit beamforming scheme",
    "was proposed in @xcite which perfectly aligns the interference to the reference interference direction of one bs and , therefore , achieves partial ia with nonzero probability . as the previous oia schemes mostly minimize the inter - cell interference , a new oia scheme that additionally considers the intra - cell power loss",
    "was also proposed in @xcite .",
    "ia techniques have been also applied to random access networks  ( rans ) based on carrier sensing multiple access ( csma ) mechanisms  @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "multiple packets from users in other overlapped networks are aligned at the physical  ( phy ) layer and the decoded packets are assumed to be exchanged through wired backhaul such as ethernet . basically , at the medium access control  ( mac ) layer in @xcite , users are scheduled like the point coordinated function ( pcf ) which is a part of ieee 802.11 standard .",
    "thus , the proposed ia algorithm in @xcite requires tight coordination among access points  ( aps ) in overlapped networks through wired backhaul and it does not consider collisions among users even though the collision effect is the most important factor to degrade the performance of rans .",
    "ia was applied to a fully distributed random access environment in @xcite like the distributed coordinated function ( dcf ) of ieee 802.11 standard . in @xcite ,",
    "the proposed mac protocol allows a new transmission even when there exist ongoing transmissions already in overlapped networks as long as the new transmitter and receiver have a sufficiently large number of antennas and ensure no interference to ongoing transmissions .",
    "thus , if users have the same number of antennas , then the performance improvement becomes limited .",
    "moreover , the dof of multiple access channel was characterized when both users and ap have multiple antennas and each user independently decides whether to transmit in a specific time , which can be regarded as the uplink scenario of a single ran  @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the authors proved the optimal average dof can be achieved by the interference alignment in specific network scenarios , but the interference among multiple rans is not considered .    in this paper , we propose a novel oia protocol in order to efficiently manage the interference among overlapped rans operating in slotted aloha protocol .",
    "the proposed oia protocol jointly considers phy and mac layers . in the phy layer ,",
    "a beamforming algorithm based on singular value decomposition ( svd ) is adopted to minimize _ generating interference _ from each user to other overlapped rans . in the mac layer ,",
    "a novel opportunistic random access algorithm is proposed , which is based on cumulative distribution function  ( cdf ) of each user s generating interference .",
    "therefore , the proposed oia protocol is a cross - layer solution for interference - limited rans .",
    "the main differences between the proposed oia protocol and the conventional oia algorithm  @xcite are as follows .",
    "* each user determines to send packets for itself in the proposed oia protocol , while base stations determine which users send packets in the conventional oia algorithm . *",
    "the proposed oia protocol utilizes the cdf value of each user s generating interference as random access criterion , while the conventional oia algorithm utilizes the very generating interference as a scheduling criterion . *",
    "the number of concurrently transmitting users in the network is a random variable in the proposed oia protocol , while it is fixed in the conventional oia algorithm .",
    "thus , the proposed oia protocol examines the number of concurrently transmitting users in the network and changes the packet decoding methodology according to the number of concurrently transmitting users .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : system_model ] describes the system model and section  [ sec : conv ] introduces the conventional techniques which can be used for interference - limited rans . in section  [ sec : oia ] , the oia protocol for the interference - limited rans is proposed .",
    "section  [ sec : evaluation ] evaluates the throughput performance of the proposed oia protocol and , finally , section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",

    "we assume that each user experiences rayleigh fading and the channel gain independently changes in each time slot .",
    "each ap is assumed to periodically transmit a pilot signal so that the users can estimate their channels to all aps located in the overlapped area by using the reciprocity of the wireless channel . in this paper",

    "in addition , we assume the interference - limited networks and the average path - loss from users to aps are assumed to be identical to each other for simplicity .",
    "for designing rans , the mitigation of collision effects among simultaneously transmitting users is one of the most challenging issues .",
    "it has been shown that multi - packet reception  ( mpr ) at the phy layer , which is implemented through multi - user multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) techniques in general , can be a promising solution   @xcite . as assumed in section  [ sec : system_model ] , each user transmits a single stream and each ap has @xmath2 antennas , each ap can successfully decode up to @xmath2 packets from transmitting users in the overlapped area by using the mpr technique  @xcite . in practice , the probability that each ap successfully decodes the received packets depends on the number of concurrently transmitting users . the average throughput ( packets / slot ) in the mac layer of @xmath0-overlapped rans with the mpr technique is obtained as @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the total number of users in the @xmath0-overlapped rans and @xmath25 denotes the probability that each received packet is successfully decoded when there exist @xmath26 concurrently transmitting users in the whole @xmath0-overlapped rans .",

    "more detailed analysis on @xmath25 is given in @xcite .",
    "in addition to mpr , we can also consider the interference nulling  ( in ) technique which utilizes the transmit beamforming at each user for overlapped rans . for applying the in technique ,",
    "each ap sets @xmath31 spatial dimensions for receiving signals from its serving users .",
    "then , each user performs transmit beamforming to make its signal arriving at the signal spaces of the other aps be zero . assuming @xmath0 overlapped rans and @xmath31 dimensional signal space at each ap , each user should make its transmit signal , which is arrived at @xmath32 dimensional signal space in other aps , be zero .",

    "while the conventional opportunistic random access in rans maximizes the signal strength of users  @xcite , each user applies the opportunism based on its effective generating interference to other rans , i.e. , the lif metric in ( [ eq : lif ] ) , in the proposed oia protocol .",
    "each user observes its lif metric for a long time to obtain the corresponding cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) .",
    "specifically , in each time slot , each user calculates its instant lif metric based on ( [ eq : lif ] ) and stores it to update the histogram of the lif values from which the cdf can be calculated by normalization .",
    "another possible methodology to obtain the cdf is as follows : let @xmath94 be the stored cdf at slot @xmath95 and the lif calculated at slot @xmath96 be @xmath97 .",

    "the transmission probability of each user becomes @xmath4 by setting the threshold to @xmath4 .",
    "if a user already has a steady state cdf of @xmath101 , the equivalent operation of the proposed protocol is that the user transmits its packet if the current lif metric is smaller than @xmath102 .",
    "as long as the number of simultaneously transmitting users in a ran is smaller than @xmath31 , the ap may decode the desired streams by treating the signals from other cells as interference which is minimized by the opportunistic transmission at the mac layer and the svd - based beamforming at the phy layer .",

    "hence , we can conclude that the interference among rans would be reduced as @xmath1 increases since a smaller @xmath4 makes the lif become smaller .    in the proposed oia protocol , each user needs to calculate its instant lif value and find the corresponding cdf value in each time slot .",
    "this process may result in computational burden to users since channel estimation and svd operation are required",
