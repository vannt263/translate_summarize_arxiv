    "the following reaction - diffusion system of fitzhugh - nagumo ( fhn ) type :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 , @xmath2 small , @xmath3 , @xmath4 regular function , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and with neumann boundary ( nbc ) conditions on a regular bounded domain @xmath8 , is relevant for obtaining different kind of patterns and interesting phenomena in physiological context .",
    "a property of system is that , due to the dependence of @xmath9 on space variable @xmath10 , it can take advantage of both excitability and oscillatory regimes of the fhn system . therefore , interesting phenomena can be obtained with this single partial differential equation such as spirals , mixed mode oscillations ( mmo s ) , propagation of bursting oscillations , see @xcite .",
    "recall that the fitzhugh - nagumo model , widely used in mathematical neuroscience , is obtained by a reduction of the hodgkin - huxley model ( 4 equations ) awarded by the 1963 nobel prize of physiology and medicine , see @xcite for original papers or for example @xcite for good fundamental books . in this article",
    ", we focus on equation in the case where @xmath9 is only depending on @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and the space dimension is 1 , i.e. :    @xmath12    on a real interval @xmath13-a , a [ , a>0 $ ] and with nbc @xmath14 . in order to understand the qualitative behavior of system , we must recall the behavior of the underlying ode system : @xmath15 we have for appropriate values of parameters , the following theorem see @xcite and references therein , which is illustrated in figure [ figsoledo ]    there exists a unique stationary point . if @xmath16 the stationary point is globally asymptotically stable , whereas if @xmath17 , it is unstable and there exists a unique limit - cycle that attracts all the non constant trajectories .",
    "furthermore , at @xmath18 , there is a supercritical hopf bifurcation .",
    "another important feature of system is excitability : for @xmath17 and @xmath9 not so far from @xmath19 , if a solution is taken away of a certain region it undergoes a large oscillation before returning to its stable state .",
    "this can be well understood by slow - fast analysis .",
    "typical behavior is represented in figure [ figsoledo ] .",
    ".,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ] [ figsoledo ]    as the @xmath9 parameter is space dependent , we can couple oscillatory and excitable cells via the diffusion term .",
    "we put some center cells in an oscillatory regime and the others in an excitable state .",
    "we then address the question of wave propagation : will the center oscillations propagate along the excitable cells ?",
    "we prove theoretically and show numerically that this depends on a parameter of excitability of the excitable cells . varying this parameter ,",
    "system exhibits stable behavior , propagation of oscillations .",
    "this phenomenon occurs through an hopf bifurcation in the infinite dimensional system .",
    "note that we have already exploited such an idea in @xcite in the case of two coupled ode slow - fast systems .",
    "the article is divided as follows : we study the spectrum properties of the linearized system of in the second section . in the third part",
    ", we apply the center manifold theorem and compute restricted equations .",
    "finally , in the fourth section we investigate numerically the phenomenon .",
    "as in the case of odes , the linear stability analysis near the stationary solution gives some insights on the qualitative behavior of the system .",
    "some theories have been developed , see @xcite , however , the rigorous proofs in infinite systems are quite intricate and there is not a well established unified theory as in the finite case . in this short paper",
    ", we will concentrate on the spectral properties of the linearized operator . in this section",
    "we shall prove the existence of a hopf bifurcation for system . some linear stability analysis for reaction - diffusion fitzhugh - nagumo ( fhn ) systems",
    "has already been studied , see for example @xcite .",
    "the first article introducing a non - homogeneous term in the fhn reaction diffusion system is @xcite .",
    "however , the following analysis involving such a non - homogeneous space dependent term @xmath4 , is new .",
    "we prove the positivity of an eigenvalue for small enough values of the bifurcation parameter by using classical spectral analysis .",
    "the remaining of the proof of the hopf bifurcation relies on techniques developed in chapter 5 of @xcite .",
    "after linearization near the stationary solution , we obtain an equation of regular liouville type .",
    "then , we introduce a polar change of coordinates",
    ". then the result follows from comparison theorems for ode s .",
    "we assume that the function @xmath4 , depending on a parameter @xmath20 , is regular and satisfies the following conditions : @xmath21\\\\ c(0)=0\\\\ c'(x)>0 & \\forall x \\in ] -a,0 [ , c'(x)<0 \\forall x \\in ] 0,a[\\\\ c'(-a)=c'(a)=0\\\\",

    "next , we prove that as @xmath51 decreases from @xmath52 to @xmath53 , the eigenvalue with the greatest real part crosses the imaginary axis from left to right , this proves the existence of the hopf bifurcation .",

    "as @xmath90 is an upper solution this shows our third claim .",
