    "the understanding that a quantum system carries information encoded in its quantum state and , thereby , could be used to accomplish information processing tasks gave rise to the fields of quantum information and computation @xcite . in order to accomplish such tasks , in the final step",
    "one has to read out the previously processed information , which corresponds to determine the final state of the system by measuring it .",
    "however , as the quantum state is not itself an observable @xcite , it is not possible to determine it through a single shot measurement , unless it belongs to a _ known _ set of states which are mutually orthogonal .",
    "when this is not the case , i.e. , the possible final states are not orthogonal , they can not be , deterministically , discriminated with certainty and without error even if they belong to a known set .",
    "this has led to the development of the area known as quantum - state discrimination ( qsd ) @xcite , where a measurement strategy is devised in order to discriminate _ optimally _ , according to some figure of merit , among nonorthogonal states .    despite that ,",
    "originally , the qsd problem has been introduced in the context of quantum detection ( or decision ) theory @xcite long before the birth of quantum information and computation , it quickly became a fundamental tool for these fields .",
    "for instance , there is an intimate connection among qsd and probabilistic protocols , like entanglement concentration @xcite , cloning @xcite , and some quantum algorithms @xcite . also , there is a connection among qsd and probabilistic realizations of quantum communication protocols like teleportation @xcite , entanglement swapping @xcite , and superdense coding @xcite .",
    "finally , the use of nonorthogonal states , and , consequently , the impossibility of perfectly discriminating among them , underlies the security in some quantum key distribution protocols @xcite .",
    "the problem addressed in qsd can be briefly posed as follows .",
    "a quantum system is prepared in one of @xmath0 possible states in the set @xmath1 , with associated _ a priori _ probabilities @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "both the set of states and the prior probabilities are _ known _ in advance @xcite . as the states",
    "are nonorthogonal , one has to design a measurement strategy which determine optimally which one was actually prepared .",
    "the optimality criteria are related with some figure of merit , mathematically formulated , and each figure corresponds to a different strategy .",
    "the oldest and , perhaps , simplest criterion comprises a measurement that minimizes the probability of making an error in identifying the state @xcite .",
    "for this so - called minimum error strategy ( me ) , the necessary and sufficient conditions that must be satisfied by the operators describing the optimized measurement are well known @xcite . nevertheless , only for a few special cases the explicit form of such measurements",
    "have been found @xcite .",
    "a second strategy , first proposed by ivanovic @xcite , allows one to identify each state in the set without error but with the possibility of obtaining an inconclusive result .",
    "this strategy , called unambiguous discrimination ( ud ) , is optimized by a measurement that minimizes the probability of inconclusive results . restricting to pure states ,",
    "the optimal ud problem was completely solved for the case of two states @xcite , while for more than two states only few analytical solutions have been derived @xcite . in this latter case",
    ", chefles @xcite showed that ud is applicable only to linearly independent sets .",
    "there exist many other measurement strategies for qsd that optimize differently formulated figures of merit .",
    "a discussion about them is beyond the scope of the present work @xcite . here",
    ", we will focus on the recently introduced maximum - confidence ( mc ) strategy , which is an optimized measurement whose outcome leads us to identify a given state in the set with the maximum possible confidence @xcite .",
    "the mc measurement can be applied to both linearly independent and linearly dependent states and , unlike the previously discussed me and ud , it allows a closed form solution for the operators describing the optimized measurement for an arbitrary set of states .",
    "in fact , mc encompasses both ud and me strategies @xcite : for linearly independent states it can reduce to ud , where our confidence in identifying the states becomes unity . on the other hand , when the maximum confidence is the same for all states and there is no inconclusive result , mc and me coincide .",
    "in the original proposal of mc measurement , croke _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have applied it , as an example , to a set of three equiprobable symmetric pure states of individual two - dimensional quantum systems , i.e. , _",
    "qubits_. later , this case was experimentally demonstrated using qubits encoded into single - photon polarization @xcite . in the present",
    "work our goal is to extend this study to individual @xmath4-dimensional quantum systems ( with @xmath5 ) , i.e. , _ qudits_. the nonorthogonal symmetric states of qudits are known to play an important role in qsd @xcite and many other quantum information protocols @xcite .",
    "motivated by this fact , we study the mc strategy applied to a set of @xmath0 linearly dependent symmetric qudit states , prepared with equal prior probabilities .",
    "usually , in this problem , an inconclusive outcome is inevitable , and from the conditions established in ref .",
    "@xcite we find the optimal positive operator valued measure ( povm ) that maximizes our confidence in identifying each state in the set and minimizes the probability of obtaining inconclusive results .",
    "the physical realization of this povm is completely determined and we show that after an inconclusive outcome , the input states may be mapped into a new set of @xmath0 equiprobable symmetric states , restricted , however , to a subspace of the original @xmath4-dimensional hilbert space . therefore , by applying the mc measurement again onto this subspace , we can still gain some information about the input states , although with less confidence than before .",
    "as we will discuss , this process may be iterated in as many stages as allowed by the input set , until no additional information can be extracted from an inconclusive result .",
    "we shall establish the conditions in which this _ sequential maximum - confidence measurement _ applies and show that at each stage , our confidence in identifying the input states is higher than or equal to the one achieved by the optimal me measurement applied in that stage",
    ". additionally , the more stages we accomplish ( within the maximum allowed ) , the higher will be the probability that this identification was correct .",
    "this type of optimized measurement proposed here does not apply for qubits since that after an inconclusive outcome the input states are projected onto a one - dimensional subspace .",
    "the optimal sequential mc measurement will be illustrated with an explicit example in the simplest possible case where it applies , which is the discrimination among four symmetric qutrit states . in this case , where there is the possibility of performing a two - stage sequential measurement , we propose an experimental procedure which could implement it .",
    "our scheme is based on single photons and linear optics .",
    "the symmetric states are encoded into the propagation modes of a single photon , and , at each stage , the optimized measurements are carried out by using the polarization degree of freedom as an ancillary system and a multiport optical interferometer @xcite with photodetectors at each of its outputs .",
    "this scheme is feasible with the current technology .",
    "the remainder of the article is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "often , the optimized measurement strategies in the problem of qsd can be treated , mathematically , within the formalism of povms @xcite .",
    "a povm is a set of operators @xmath6 which , in order to form a physically realizable measurement , must satisfy the conditions @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the identity operator on the hilbert space of the system . each povm element @xmath9 corresponds to a measurement outcome @xmath10 and the probability of obtaining this outcome by measuring a quantum system in the state @xmath11",
    "is given by @xmath12 .    in the mc measurement for qsd , the figure of merit to be optimized is the probability that the prepared state was @xmath13 , given that the outcome of a measurement was @xmath10 .",
    "this conditional probability , @xmath14 , is interpreted as our confidence in taking the outcome @xmath10 to indicate the state @xmath13 , and an optimal measurement should maximize it @xcite . using bayes rule and the above observations about measurement , this quantity can be written as @xmath15 in this expression , @xmath16 is the known preparation probability for the state @xmath13 ; @xmath17 , where @xmath9 is the povm element associated with the outcome @xmath10 and @xmath18 is the total probability of occurrence for the outcome @xmath10 , where @xmath19 is the _ a priori _ density operator for the system .    as mentioned in the introduction , the mc measurement has a closed form solution for any set of states .",
    "in particular , for a set of pure states , the povm element that maximizes the conditional probability in eq .",
    "( [ eq : confidence ] ) is @xcite @xmath20 with the weighting factor @xmath21 given by @xmath22 the corresponding maximum confidence that the outcome @xmath10 identifies the state @xmath23 becomes @xmath24_{\\rm max } = p_{j}{\\rm tr}\\left(\\hat\\rho_{j}\\hat\\rho^{-1}\\right).\\ ] ]    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : confidence ] ) one can see that the weighting factor @xmath21 of the optimal povm element ( [ eq : optimal_povm ] ) has no effect on the maximum confidence with which we can identify the state @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , we can construct each optimal @xmath9 , independently , up to an arbitrary multiplicative factor , but taking into account the first two constraints of eq .",
    "( [ eq : povm_conditions ] ) . in some occasions , there is no choice of factors @xmath25 that enables the set of operators @xmath6 to fulfill the completeness condition in eq .",

    "an inconclusive result must be added , with the corresponding povm element @xmath26 subjected to the constraint @xmath27 .",
    "an additional criterion of optimality is to choose a set @xmath25 which minimizes the probability of inconclusive result .",
    "in this section we apply the mc strategy to discriminate among nonorthogonal symmetric pure states of a _ single - qudit _ system . before doing so ,",
    "let us motivate the problem by defining the symmetric states and their importance in the context of qsd and practical applications of quantum information .",
    "a set of @xmath0 pure states @xmath28 spanning a @xmath4-dimensional hilbert space , @xmath29 , is called symmetric if there exists a unitary transformation @xmath30 on @xmath29 such that @xcite    [ eq : def_sym ] @xmath31    if @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is an orthonormal basis in which @xmath30 is diagonal , then from its unitarity and the condition ( [ eq : def_sym_c ] ) , this operator can be written as @xmath34 expanding @xmath35 in the basis @xmath32 and using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : def_sym ] ) and ( [ eq : unit ] ) , the symmetric states will be given by @xmath36 and , without loss of generality , we will assume that all of the @xmath37 are nonzero .",
    "these states play a very important role in the development of qsd . in general , for a given discrimination strategy , finding the optimal povm for an arbitrary set of states is a highly nontrivial task .",
    "however , the equiprobable symmetric states provide analytical solutions for many of those strategies , as , for instance , me @xcite and ud @xcite .",
    "in addition the problem of discriminating among symmetric states of qudits naturally arises in some quantum information protocols like entanglement concentration @xcite and quantum teleportation @xcite and entanglement swapping @xcite via nonmaximally entangled channels .",

    "it can be shown that the set of operators ( [ eq : povm_elem ] ) will form a povm only if @xmath50 and @xmath51 for all @xmath52 .",
    "this povm is the square - root measurement which is the optimal me measurement @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this particular case , the inconclusive outcome will not be necessary and mc and me strategies coincide .",
    "on the other hand , when the magnitude of the state coefficients are not all the same , those operators will not form a povm for any choice of @xmath25 , and we must include an inconclusive outcome with the povm element given by @xmath53 . for the specific problem under study , this operator can be simplified by noting that the factors @xmath21 , given by eq .",

    "the only exception occurs when @xmath50 for all @xmath52 . in this case , mc and me strategies coincide , as we discussed before , and the equality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mc_in_me ] ) holds . in the next section",
    ", we will see that the optimized me measurement ( [ eq : povm_me ] ) also applies in one step of the optimized mc measurement for discriminating equiprobable symmetric qudit states .",
    "in this section we describe , abstractly , the implementation of the mc measurements for discriminating symmetric qudit states discussed previously .",
    "we begin by noting that , as pointed out by croke _",
    "@xcite , the mc strategy can be thought of as a two - step process . in the first step ,",
    "a two - outcome measurement is performed where one outcome is associated with the success ( @xmath72 ) and the other with the failure ( @xmath73 ) of the process . if @xmath72 is obtained , the result is interpreted as successful in the sense that the input states undergo a transformation which enables their identification with maximum confidence by a proper measurement implemented in the _ second _ step . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath73 is obtained , the result is interpreted as failure ( or inconclusive ) in the sense that the transformed input states can not be identified ( at all or with maximum confidence , as we will see later ) by any further measurement .",
    "therefore , the outcome @xmath73 occurs with probability @xmath74 and is associated with the povm element @xmath75 .",
    "accordingly , the outcome @xmath72 occurs with probability @xmath76 and is associated with the povm element @xmath77 .",
    "the whole description of the discrimination process above can be made clearer by resorting to the effect ( or detection ) operators , @xmath78 and @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "when a measurement associated with the povm @xmath80 is performed on the state @xmath11 and the result is @xmath81 , the postmeasurement state changes as @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , the pair of operators @xmath78 and @xmath79 transform the initial state according to the outcome of a measurement . in terms of these operators ,",
    "any given povm element can be written as @xmath83 , and the knowledge of @xmath84 allows us to determine the effect operators , up to an arbitrary unitary transformation @xmath85 , through the relation @xmath86 . for our particular problem , in the first step of the process",
    ", we have to implement a two - outcome povm given by @xmath87 .",
    "the effect operators @xmath88 and @xmath89 associated with the outcomes @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively , are obtained from the operator @xmath75 [ eq .  (",
    "[ eq : povm_?_opt ] ) ] and are given by @xmath90 @xmath91 thanks to our freedom in designing the unitary transformation @xmath85 , a convenient choice for our purposes will be @xmath92 this operator simply removes the relative phases of the postmeasurement states which are associated with the input - state coefficients @xmath93 ( [ eq : symm_state ] ) .",
    "as we will see , this simplifies the discrimination measurement to be implemented in the second step .",
    "the physical implementation of a povm requires the extension of the hilbert space of the system to be measured @xcite .",
    "this can be provided either by an ancillary quantum system ( _ ancilla _ ) or by adding unused extra dimensions of the original system ( if they exist ) .",
    "the first method is called tensor product extension ( tpe ) and the second direct sum extension ( dse ) @xcite . in either case , the povm is implemented through a unitary operation acting on the extended space followed by a projective measurement on the ancilla system ( tpe ) or the entire extended space ( dse ) .",

    ", we will consider the tpe method .",
    "therefore , we introduce a two - dimensional ancillary system whose hilbert space is spanned by the logical basis @xmath94 . in terms of the effect operators @xmath88 ( [ eq : det_op_succ ] ) and @xmath89 ( [ eq : det_op _ ? ] ) , the unitary transformation that couples the original @xmath4-dimensional system and the ancilla can be written as @xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the identity and @xmath97 is the pauli @xmath98 operator , both acting on the ancilla space . without loss of generality ,",

    "the smc measurement applied for symmetric qudit states , as proposed here , may have important applications .",
    "for instance , it is well known that after a unsuccessful attempt of unambiguously discriminating among equiprobable symmetric qudit states , the input set is mapped onto a linearly dependent set of states which are also symmetric and equally likely @xcite . due to the linear dependence",
    ", this set can not be unambiguously discriminated by any further process . however , by carrying out a smc measurement , our confidence in identifying the input states would significantly increase .",
    "we also anticipate other applications for the results presented in this article in the quantum communication protocols of entanglement swapping and quantum teleportation for high - dimensional quantum systems .",
    "when the quantum channel has nonmaximal schmidt rank , it can be shown that these processes are mapped to the problem of discriminating linearly dependent symmetric states with the maximum confidence @xcite . moreover , for some quantum channels it might be possible to implement the smc measurement introduced here , such that successful outcomes at each stage will lead to the highest possible fidelity ( in that stage ) for the protocol .                                                      c. h. bennett and g. brassard , in _ proceedings of ieee international conference on computers , systems , and signal processing , bangalore , india",
