    "analyses of hete-2- and bepposax - localized gamma - ray bursts with known redshifts provide evidence that the isotropic - equivalent grb energy @xmath1evolves with redshift @xcite .",
    "the assessment of the strength of this evidence is linked with the issue of detection thresholds , which can create apparent energy - redshift correlations by truncation .",
    "the modeling of such thresholds is a complex and delicate matter    we present here a method , based on the likelihood function , for analyzing grb @xmath0fluence  redshift data in the presence of instrument thresholds .",
    "we have developed the method with a view to addressing the question of whether grb properties do , in fact , evolve with redshift .",
    "we compare observations of grb data with a model of grb source properties , using the likelihood function .",
    "the data consists of grb fluences and @xmath0values , with errors , and grb afterglow redshifts , where available .",
    "we use the results of fits of the band function to integrated grb spectra .",
    "the fit parameters that we use as data are @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the amplitude  the scale factor that multiplies the band function .",
    "these parameters are supplemented by their errors , @xmath5and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the model is a generalization of the variable - angle uniform jet model of lamb , donaghy and graziani @xcite .",
    "the generalization is that the parameters of the distribution of jet opening angles are allowed to evolve with redshift .",
    "the observables of the model are :    * @xmath7 , the redshift .",
    "* @xmath8 . *",
    "@xmath9 , where @xmath10is the @xmath0   parameter in the source frame . *",
    "@xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the opening half - angle of the uniform jet . *",
    "@xmath13 , where @xmath14is the prompt gamma - ray energy actually emitted : @xmath15 .",
    "the model is introduced through the differential event rate : @xmath16 where    * @xmath17 is proportional to the rowan - robinson @xcite sfr function , multiplied by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the proper volume of the sphere bounded by redshift @xmath7 .",
    "* @xmath20 , with @xmath21 @xcite and @xmath22  a fit parameter . *",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 may be functions of redshift .",
    "* @xmath28 , with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , is the broadened amati relation @xcite .",
    "the likelihood function is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the expected number of events observed by the @xmath33-th instrument , given its specific threshold , and @xmath34 is the individual likelihood of the @xmath35-th event observed by the @xmath33-th instrument .",
    "( [ lfn ] ) , the expected number of events @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 note that :    * @xmath38 is the detection probability by the @xmath33-th instrument of a grb whose vital statistics are @xmath39 .",
    "it is here that the instrumental threshold is incorporated .",
    "@xmath40 is given by an analytic function that depends on the instrument thresholds .",
    "we adopt the threshold values of band @xcite . *",
    "the factor @xmath41 is the probability that our line - of - sight lies inside the jet .",
    "* @xmath32 is reducible to a three - dimensional integral over @xmath7 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "this integral must be performed numerically .    in eq .",
    "( [ lfn ] ) , the event likelihood @xmath44 is expressed in terms of variables @xmath45 , @xmath46 , which are related to @xmath42 , @xmath43by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the band - function low - energy power - law index ( assumed equal to -1 throughout ) , @xmath49 is a unit - conversion constant , and @xmath50 is the luminosity distance .",
    "we then have @xmath51.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this integral may be performed analytically by standard techniques .    in the case of events for which no redshift is known ,",
    "the event likelihood should be replaced in the full likelihood by its marginalized version , i.e. @xmath52 .",
    "grb evolution is currently implemented by allowing the three parameters of @xmath53 ( power - law index , lower- and upper - bounds of power - law domain ) to be themselves power - laws in @xmath54 . evolution may be turned off by setting the indices of these power - laws to zero .",
    "the likelihood function is interpreted according to the principles of bayesian inference .",
    "it is converted to a posterior density by multiplication by an assumed prior density on the model parameters .",
    "the shape of the resulting probability distribution in parameter space may be used to estimate ( or set constraints upon ) the parameter values .",
    "the peak of the distribution constitutes the best - fit parameter estimate , while confidence regions may be obtained by considering level curves of the posterior density containing prescribed amounts of probability ( 90% , say ) .",
    "we are currently validating the code by running it on samples of simulated ( non - evolving ) grbs produced by the simulator described in @xcite .",
    "figure [ f1 ] shows the result of estimating the power - law index of the @xmath55 distribution using 25 events drawn from a simulation that assumes an index @xmath56 .",
    "the true value of the index lies within the 90% confidence interval .",
    "work on estimating @xmath22  and the other power - law parameters ( which are more broadly distributed and more highly correlated ) is in progress .",
    "we will be applying the experience obtained from analyzing simulations to real data from hete , bepposax and batse in the near future ."
