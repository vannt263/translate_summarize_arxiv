    "the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath7 ) , hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath13 ) and hyperon - hyperon ( @xmath14 ) interactions are crucial not only for understanding ordinary nuclei , hypernuclei and the neutron - star interiors  @xcite but also for exploring exotic multi - quark systems such as the @xmath5-dibaryon  @xcite .",
    "there are two methods proposed so far to study hadron interactions from first principle lattice qcd simulations : the lscher s finite volume method for scattering phase - shifts  @xcite and the hal qcd method for hadron - hadron potentials  @xcite .",
    "both methods are extensively applied to the meson - meson , meson - baryon and baryon - baryon systems in recent years and have been shown to be useful to derive scattering and bound - state observables . in the lscher s method , effect of the finite lattice volume is utilized to extract the scattering phase shifts directly  @xcite . in the hal qcd method , the notion of the  potential \" , which is insenstive to the finite lattice volume , is introduced as a kernel of the scattering t - matrix to calculate the observbles  @xcite .    in our previous paper",
    "@xcite , we reported an exploratory study of the baryon - baryon ( @xmath15 ) potentials by full qcd simulations in the flavor @xmath6 limit with a lattice volume @xmath16 fm and a pseudo - scalar meson mass @xmath17 mev : we have observed ( i ) flavor - spin dependence of the short range part of the @xmath15 potentials and its connection to the quark pauli principle , and ( ii ) possible existence of a shallow six - quark bound state in the flavor - single channel due to attractive core in this channel .",
    "the latter observation was further strengthened by our simulations in the flavor @xmath6 limit with a larger volume ( @xmath18 fm ) and a smaller mass @xmath19 mev  @xcite and by an independent study with the ( 2 + 1)-flavor simulations with the pion mass @xmath20 mev analyzed by the lscher s method  @xcite .",
    "one of the purposes of the present paper is to present a full account of the @xmath15 potentials and @xmath5-dibaryon on the basis of the lattice data at @xmath18 fm with the pseudo - scalar meson mass as small as @xmath21 mev .",
    "we note that an extended hal qcd method of extracting the @xmath15 potential from the _ time - dependent _ nambu - bethe - salpeter wave function  @xcite is employed in the present paper as well as in our recent reports  @xcite .",
    "another purpose of this paper is to pursue phenomenological estimate of the flavor @xmath6 breaking on the @xmath5-dibaryon by taking into account the mass splitting of octet baryons .",
    "in contrast to the recent studies along this line using chiral effective field theory  @xcite , we fully utilize the @xmath15 potentials obtained in our simulations and solve the coupled channel @xmath10-@xmath11-@xmath12 system to obtain the phase - shifts and complex poles .",
