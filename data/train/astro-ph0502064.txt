    "@xcite , hereafter tmm , discovered spectroscopically in hen 3 - 1341 (= v2523 oph ) one of the finest examples of highly collimated bipolar jets seen in a symbiotic binary .",
    "the jets , with a projected velocity of @xmath17@xmath18rv@xmath4@xmath17@xmath1820  km  sec@xmath8 , were observed when the system was in outburst at @xmath1910.5 mag .",
    "no follow - up study monitored the jet or outburst evolution .",
    "some symbiotic binaries are already known to present or have presented jets , in the optical and/or radio : r  aqr @xcite , ch  cyg @xcite , mwc  560 @xcite , rs  oph @xcite , hen  2 - 104 @xcite and hen  3 - 1341 ( tmm ) .",
    "other possible examples of jets or collimated mass outflows from symbiotic binaries and related systems are sth@xmath20  190 @xcite , z  and @xcite , ag  dra @xcite , v1329  cyg and hd  149427 @xcite .",
    "to correlate in symbiotic stars the appearance of jets with the system properties is not an easy task .",
    "in fact , the ionized circumstellar gas is so bright in the optical and ultraviolet as to prevent direct observation of the central engine , which is believed to be an accreting white dwarf that in many cases experiences quasi - stable surface h - burning @xcite . the standard scenario for the production of jets ( e.g. @xcite ) involves an accretion disk which is threaded by a vertical magnetic field and an energy / wind source associated with the central accreting object .",
    "a widespread presence of accretion disks and magnetic fields in symbiotic binaries is still matter of debate .",
    "convincing detection of a magnetic field in a symbiotic binary has been so far obtained only for z  and @xcite , in the form of a persistent @xmath210.005  mag amplitude oscillation at 28  min period interpreted as the spin period of a magnetic wd .",
    "the detection was made possible by the outburst state of z  and at the time of the observations , which largely increased the optical brightness of the wd and reduced that of the circumstellar nebular material by reducing the feeding of ionizing photons .",
    "direct evidences for accretion disks are missing , given their low luminosity compared with the glare of the circumstellar nebular material and the brightness of the central star ( especially if burning hydrogen at the surface ) .",
    "indirect suggestions for the presence of disks are generally based on the interpretation of the flickering so far detected in @xmath120% of surveyed symbiotic stars ( e.g. ch  cyg : @xcite ; t  crb : @xcite ; mwc  560 : @xcite ; rs  oph and mira a+b : @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we present direct evidences that , at least in the symbiotic binary hen  3 - 1341 , the appearance of bipolar jets is limited to the early and brightest outburst phases , and that the jets are fed by the wind from the outbursting component . when the wind quenches during the decline from outburst maximum , the jets also vanish , in a 1:1 correspondence .",

    "the arrows point to the epochs of the spectra in figure  3.,width=317 ]",
    "when tmm discovered the jets in the summer of 1999 they found hen  3 - 1341 at @xmath22=10.5 , much brighter than on the palomar charts ( @xmath23=14.0 ) , and concluded the system was undergoing an outburst .",
    "not much else is known about the photometric and spectroscopic history of hen  3 - 1341 or the reality and characteristics of the outburst itself .",
    "a proper investigation is mandatory for the obvious implications on the nature and evolution of the jets .    with the aim of recovering the photometric history of hen  3 - 1341 ,",
    "we have ( @xmath24 ) obtained _ ubv(ri)@xmath25jhk _ photometry of hen  3 - 1341 with the usno 1.0 m and 1.5 m telescopes , ( @xmath26 ) measured the brightness on photographic plates found in the asiago 67/92 schmidt archive and on plates of the dss-1 , dss-2 , gsc and vehrenberg s photographic surveys , and ( @xmath27 ) derived _",
    "ubv(ri)@xmath25 _ magnitudes from published optical spectra calibrated into absolute fluxes .",
    "these data are given in table  1 together with values from the 2mass and denis survey , and _",
    "ubv(ri)@xmath25jhk _ from the symbiotic star photometric catalogs of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they are plotted in figure  1 , together with amateur estimates kindly provided by albert jones ( new zealand ) and vsnet organization , to document the photometric evolution over the last 15  yr .            figure  1 reveals that hen  3 - 1341 has undergone a large outburst lasting from 1998 to 2004 , characterized by a rapid rise to maximum and a complex pattern of minima and maxima during the decline phase .",
    "the outburst reached maximum @xmath22 brightness right at the time tmm discovered the jets and found the high ionization emission lines to have vanished and lower energy ones somewhat weakened while an a - type continuum dominated the spectrum , like in a typical symbiotic star outburst ( cf .",
    "the end of the outburst and return to quiescence by summer 2004 is confirmed by the spectrum in figure  2 , that we obtained on july 17 , 2004 with the b&c+ccd spectrograph of the 1.22 m telescope operated in asiago by the depart . of astronomy of the univ . of padova .",
    "the spectrum is characterized by strong emission lines of [ fevii ] , [ nev ] , heii and ovi ( raman scattered ) , identical to the 1993 pre - outburst quiescent spectrum by @xcite .",
    "the emission line spectrum of hen  3 - 1341 in quiescence both in the optical ( from figure  2 ) and in the ultraviolet ( the iue spectrum of @xcite ) has been modeled with the cloudy software package ( see http://www.nublado.org/ ) to get round estimates of basic physical parameters , assuming a simple spherical symmetric gas distribution originating from the @xmath28(r ) @xmath29 r@xmath30 wind of the cool giant ionized by the radiation from the wd companion .",
    "we found the nebular material to be radiation bounded and to extend for @xmath117  au , for a total mass of @xmath1710@xmath31  m@xmath4 contained within .",
    "the gas electronic temperature and density are @xmath32@xmath1110@xmath2  k and @xmath33@xmath1210@xmath34  @xmath35 close to the ionizing source , decreasing to @xmath32@xmath1410@xmath5  k and @xmath36@xmath1610@xmath2  @xmath35 at the ionization boundary .",
    "the modeling supports solar metallicity and chemical partition , although with ne and n apparently enhanced by @xmath110@xmath37 ( which is what is expected when ejecta or wind from the outbursting wd are mixed with the circumstellar material originating from the m giant , cf .",
    "@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the central star has @xmath0@xmath11.210@xmath2  k and @xmath38@xmath1  0.14  r@xmath4 , for a luminosity of 3.810@xmath5  l@xmath4 , which are consistent with those previously found by @xcite .",
    "such a quiescent luminosity can not be sustained by pure accretion since that would require an implausibly large accretion rate of 110@xmath31  m@xmath4  yr@xmath8 on a 0.5  m@xmath4 wd .",
    "the quiescent luminosity is instead well explained by stable h - burning conditions of accreted matter on the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "because the stably burning wd in hen  3 - 1341 does not expand to large dimensions during quiescence , the accretion rate must match the burning rate , or @xmath39@xmath1510@xmath7",

    "k and @xmath3@xmath1  0.1  r@xmath4 correspond to a stable h - burning 0.4  m@xmath4 white dwarf . from table  1",
    "it is evident that the white dwarf in hen  3 - 1341 has been in that state since at least the time of the first palomar survey , 50 yr ago .",
    "this is in line with the theoretical expectations for a 0.4  m@xmath4 h - burning white dwarf , that predicts an  on \" period of @xmath15000  yr , or ten times shorter if the mass of the envelope is reduced by a wind @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\">,<,<,<,<,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to gain physical insight on the optical 1998 - 2004 outburst we have integrated the energy between the outburst light - curve in figure  1 and the @xmath22@xmath113.1 reference value for quiescence , to derive the total radiated energy .",
    "the color evolution of the outbursting component is missing for lack of multi - band simultaneous observations .",
    "color information is available ( cf .",
    "table  1 ) only for the three observations in 2000 , when the outbursting component was roughly midway between outburst maximum and quiescence . for sake of discussion",
    ", the corresponding @xmath23@xmath41@xmath22=0.52 is taken to represent the average color of the outbursting component . to estimate the reddening we have measured the equivalent width of interstellar nai and ki absorption lines in high resolution spectra of hen  3 - 1341 that we have secured with elodie spectrograph at the observatoire de haute - provence ( ohp ) and the echelle spectrograph at the 1.82 m telescope operated in asiago by the italian national institute of astrophysics ( inaf ) .",
    "following the calibration of @xcite , the reddening is found to be @xmath42=0.47 and therefore the intrinsic average color for the outbursting component is ( @xmath23@xmath41@xmath22)@xmath43=0.05 . the corresponding bolometric correction is @xmath410.10 according to @xcite and the spectral type is a2 following @xcite . adopting the distance of 3.1  kpc derived by @xcite , the total energy radiated by the outburst turns out to be @xmath1610@xmath11  erg .",
    "it would correspond to the potential energy released by the accretion onto a 0.5  m@xmath4 white dwarf of @xmath1410@xmath31  m@xmath4 ( at a mean rate of @xmath1110@xmath31  m@xmath4yr@xmath8 ) which is implausibly large .",
    "in fact , it is orders of magnitude larger than the typical mass dumped through an accretion disk during outbursts in cataclysmic variables @xcite , and the required mass loss from the donor star would be orders of magnitude larger than expected for the m2iii non - variable companion , which did not experience any major instability at the time of outburst onset ( cf .",
    "stable infrared magnitudes in table  1 ) .",
    "the 610@xmath11  erg radiated during the outburst instead correspond to the nuclear burning of @xmath1510@xmath7  m@xmath4 of hydrogen , at an average rate of @xmath1110@xmath7  m@xmath4yr@xmath8 or @xmath1110@xmath5  l@xmath4 .",
    "this corresponds to about @xmath11/4 of the luminosity in quiescence .",
    "this suggests that the 1998 - 2004 event , that we previously called an  outburst \" , was actually a partial reprocessing into the optical of the radiation flowing into the far uv during  quiescence \" .",
    "in fact strong hydrogen and hei emission lines remained always visible , in spite of a recombination time of the order of @xmath44@xmath11/(@xmath45@xmath46)@xmath12  months even at the outer boundary of the ionized gas region , indicating that not all uv radiation was suppressed .",
    "the reprocessing took place in the envelope of the wd that expanded and cooled to @xmath47@xmath1110@xmath10  k and r@xmath1  20  r@xmath4 .",
    "the width of the stable h - burning strip in the m@xmath48 , @xmath49 plane is a narrow one , and minimal increases in @xmath49 triggers an expansion and consequent cooling of the wd envelope ( cf .",
    "we are therefore led to interpret the 1998 - 2004  outburst \" as having been caused by a temporary ( and marginal ) increase in the mass loss from the m2iii that gave no appreciable signal in the ir photometry of table  1 but caused @xmath49 to rise above the narrow equilibrium strip .",
    "the surplus accreted material was partially burned and partially carried away by the fast wind traced by the p - cyg profiles of hei lines in figure  3 .",
    "when the wd envelope mass returned to equilibrium value , the envelope retraced to small radius and high temperature and hen  3 - 1341 resumed the photometric and spectroscopic  quiescent \" appearance .",
    "following the discovery of bipolar jets by tmm in june 1999 , we re - observed hen  3 - 1341 in high resolution at later dates .",
    "the results for h@xmath20 and hei  5876    profiles are shown in figure  3 together with the original tmm discovery spectrum and a pre - outburst spectrum obtained at eso by @xcite . from figure  3",
    "it is evident how the bipolar jets were absent in the quiescence _ before _ as well as _",
    "after _ the outburst , and were strongest at peak outburst optical brightness , declining in strength with the outburst retracing from maximum .",
    "it is worth noticing the similarity between the terminal wind velocity ( @xmath1770  km  sec@xmath8 ) and jet projected velocity ( @xmath17@xmath18rv@xmath4@xmath17@xmath1820  km  sec@xmath8 ) at the time of onset of the jets ( june 1999 ) , which is best appreciated in the left insert of the bottom panel of figure  1 of tmm . a most interesting comparison is between jet strength and amount of mass loss by wind from the wd as traced by the p - cyg profiles of hei lines in figure  3 .",
    "the correlation is a very tight one .",
    "the jets were most prominent when the wind was strongest , and declined in parallel with the decrease of wind intensity . to our knowledge ,",
    "these evidences are among the most direct and convincing proofs of the ` _ energy / wind source associated with the central accreting object _ ' postulated by @xcite mechanism of jet production .",
    "we suggest that the search for jets in symbiotic stars should be focused on the outburst phases characterized by maximum wind intensity .    from the integrated flux of the jet features in the h@xmath20 spectrum at outburst maximum in figure  3 ( jun 8 , 1999 ) , and assuming that all the hydrogen within the jets is ionized and that the jets are optical thin in h@xmath20 , a total mass in the jets of @xmath50@xmath12.510@xmath13  m@xmath4 is derived . the kinetic energy deposited in the jets corresponding to the observed 820  km",
    "sec@xmath8 projected velocity is therefore @xmath14@xmath11.710@xmath15(@xmath16)@xmath8  erg , where @xmath51 is the unknown orbital inclination .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath10.3(@xmath52)@xmath8% of the total energy radiated during the outburst .",
    "figure  3 suggests a small increase with time in the observed velocity separation of the jets , amounting to @xmath17@xmath18rv@xmath4@xmath17@xmath1820  km  sec@xmath8 on june 1999 , 910  km  sec@xmath8 on sept .",
    "1999 , and 1000  km  sec@xmath8 on sept . 2001 .",
    "different explanations could be invoked - including a variable projection angle of the jet axis on the line of sight as caused by a precession motion - but there are not enough data to decide in favor of any of them .    finally , we have also searched for a signature of rotation of a magnetic wd in hen  3 - 1341 by looking for coherent modulation in time resolved @xmath23-band photometry that we secured in 2004 with the usno 1.0 m telescope ( see figure  4 )",
    ". none was found , but this was an expected result , because with the system in quiescence the circumstellar nebular emission is enormously brighter that the wd in @xmath23 band .",
    "a more profitable search will have to wait for the next outburst state of hen  3 - 1341 .",
