    "much interest has recently centered on the possibility that fundamental constants such as the fine structure constant might vary with cosmic time .",
    "many theoretical models , such as superstring theories ( presently the best candidate to unify gravity and the other fundamental interactions ) and kaluza - klein theories , _ naturally predict a spatio - temporal variation of these constants_. such models usually invoke extra dimensions compactified on tiny scales , with the fundamental constants arising as functions of the scale lengths of these extra dimensions ( e.g. @xcite ) . at present , no mechanism has been found to keep the compactified scale - lengths constant implying that , if extra dimensions exist and their sizes undergo cosmological evolution , the three dimensional coupling constants should vary with time ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ". several other modern theories also provide strong motivation for an experimental search for variation in the fine structure constant ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , varying constants provide alternative solutions to cosmological fine - tuning problems , such as the `` flatness problem '' and the `` horizon problem '' @xcite .    from terrestrial experiments ,",
    "@xcite find @xmath6 , whereas @xmath7 is found by @xcite , each from isotopic abundances measured in the oklo natural fission reactor .",
    "this is @xmath8 years old , corresponding to a redshift of @xmath9 .",
    "however , astrophysical studies of redshifted spectral lines provide a powerful probe of putative changes in fundamental constants over a large fraction of the age of the universe ( e.g.  @xcite ) : recent studies of the relative redshifts of metal - ion atomic resonance transitions in the optical ( keck / hires ) quasar spectra of 143 heavy element absorption systems are consistent with a smaller fine structure constant in the intervening absorption clouds over the redshift range @xmath10    ( 0,0 ) ( -0.15,-1.85 )    ( fig.[f1 ] ) .",
    "however , since all of the observations which suggest a change in @xmath1 use the same telescope and instrument @xcite , despite our best efforts @xcite , unforeseen systematic effects can not be ruled out .",
    "furthermore , @xcite find no such variation from vlt / uves data of 23 systems ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "given the implications for theoretical physics , it is clear that independent checks are required which can refute or confirm the optical results . in particular ,",
    "radio studies offer :    1 .   a different technique of potentially much higher accuracy than the purely optical methods",
    "the ability to study the evolution of other dimensionless fundamental constants , besides @xmath1 .",
    "currently , however , the paucity of systems exhibiting hi 21 cm together with rotational or optical absorption severely limits our ability to carry out statistically sound comparisons . in this chapter",
    "we shall discuss how the ska is expected to significantly increase the number of high redshift radio absorbers from which detailed study can greatly improve constraints in the cosmological variation in the fine structure constant , the ratio of electron  proton mass , and the proton g - factor .",
    "spectral lines such as the  21  cm line , cm - wave oh lines and mm - wave co and hco@xmath12 lines arise from different physical mechanisms and hence have different dependences on these constants ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "further , the spectral resolution commonly available in radio spectroscopy is typically far better than that obtained in the optical domain , allowing higher precision redshift measurements .",
    "consider two transitions , with rest frequencies @xmath13 and @xmath14 that depend on redshift through their ( different ) dependences on certain fundamental constants .",
    "the ratio of the two frequencies , @xmath15 will vary with redshift as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the _ measured _ redshifts of the two lines in a given object and @xmath19 is the value of the ratio at the present epoch .",
    "one could thus , in principle , compare the redshift of an object as measured from the  21  cm , oh , and millimetre transitions , as well as the optical fine structure lines , in order to determine the evolution of combinations of different constants .",
    "clearly , this must be carried out on a statistically large sample of objects in order to average out any intrinsic velocity offsets between the different species or differing lines of sight between the mm - wave and cm - wave continua .",
    "the  21 cm line arises from a hyperfine spin - flip transition ( @xmath20 mhz ) , produced by the interaction of the magnetic fields of the electron and proton .",
    "the line frequency has the dependence @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the rydberg constant .",
    "since this cancels out when comparing frequency ratios , it is usually not quoted in the literature . ] . by comparison ,",
    "the frequency of the optical transitions , governed by coulombic interactions , are @xmath23 thus we see that the spin - flip transition is @xmath24 times as sensitive than the optical resonance transition to a given change in @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the ratio of frequencies is @xmath25 ( e.g. @xcite ) , and so increasing the number of cosmologically distant qso absorption systems with both optical and 21 cm lines would result in a significant improvement in measuring any cosmological changes in @xmath26 .",
    "cm - wave oh lines allow the interesting possibility of simultaneously measuring changes in @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath27 , using spectral lines of a _ single species _ @xcite .",
    "this is because these lines arise from two entirely different physical mechanisms , lambda - doubling and hyperfine splitting @xcite , which have different dependences on the above constants : each oh state gives rise to four cm - wave lines , allowing the possibility of multiple , independent estimates of any cosmological evolution .",
    "the strongest transitions are found in the ground state , at frequencies of @xmath28  mhz and 1667.359  mhz ( `` main '' lines ) and 1612.231  mhz and 1720.530  mhz ( `` satellite '' lines ) . at present , these are the only lambda - doubled lines to have been detected at cosmological distances @xcite and hence , the best candidates for searches at higher redshifts with the ska .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that the ska will cover the frequencies of _ all _ known lambda - doubled oh lines ( i.e. rest frequencies of 1.6 to 13 ghz ) with high sensitivity .",
    "an interesting aspect of the oh lines is the fact that various line frequency differences depend on all three of the above constants , while the frequency sums only depend on @xmath1 and @xmath27 .",
    "for example , in the case of the ground state 18 cm lines , we have @xcite @xmath29 where we see that equations ( [ eqn : oh18cm1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : oh18cm3 ] ) have very different dependences on both @xmath1 and @xmath27 , giving the ratio of the two frequencies a high sensitivity to changes in their numerical values .    in the next excited state ,",
    "@xmath30 , only the 4750.656  mhz main line is allowed ( the @xmath31 main line is forbidden ) .",
    "this has the dependence @xcite @xmath32 again , equations  ( [ eqn : oh18cm1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : oh6 cm ] ) have very different dependences on @xmath1 and @xmath27 : in fact , their ratio is proportional to @xmath33 , one of the most sensitive to a change in the fine structure constant .",
    "mm - wave molecular lines from species such as co , hco@xmath12 , etc .",
    "arise from rotational transitions ( e.g. @xcite ) , with line frequencies proportional to @xmath34 , thus providing a useful `` anchor '' with which to compare the  and oh transitions .",
    "the high spectral resolution available makes millimetre lines potentially very useful and they may be compared with the 21 cm line giving @xcite @xmath35 or with the oh lines , giving + @xmath36 regarding these last constraints , a fairly tight linear correlation has been found between hco@xmath12 and oh column densities , both in the galaxy @xcite and out to @xmath37 @xcite , extending over more than two orders of magnitude in column density .",
    "this suggests that hco@xmath12 and oh are likely to be located in the same region of a molecular cloud , reducing the likelihood of velocity offsets between the two species .",
    "similarly , @xcite demonstrated a correlation between the individual velocity components of 21  cm and hco@xmath12 absorption along 9 lines of sight in the galaxy , with a dispersion of 1.2  .",
    "only four redshifted radio molecular absorbers are presently known : @xmath38 toward pks  1413 + 135 ; @xmath39 toward b3  1504 + 377 ; @xmath40 toward b0218 + 357 ; and @xmath41 toward pks  1830210 .",
    "the  21  cm @xcite , millimetre ( e.g. co ) @xcite and 18  cm oh main lines @xcite have been detected in all these systems while the 18  cm oh satellite lines have only been detected towards pks  1413 + 135 @xcite .",
    "these satellite lines have a clear velocity offset ( @xmath42  ) from the main oh ,  and mm - wave lines .",
    "further , the current  and oh spectra toward pks  1830210 and b3  1504 + 377 have fairly poor velocity resolutions ( @xmath43   @xcite ) , giving low accuracy measurements . as a result ,",
    "constraints on changes in different combinations of fundamental constants are only available from the lines of sight toward pks  1413 + 135 and b0218 + 357 :    1 .   by comparing vlba  21  cm redshifts with those obtained from the co line , @xcite obtained @xmath44 at @xmath40 towards b0218 + 357 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , at @xmath47 towards pks  1413 + 135",
    "the redshift of the sum of oh  1665 and 1667  mhz lines toward b0218 + 357 is in agreement with both the  21  cm and hco@xmath12 redshifts @xcite and gives the constraint @xmath48 ( comparing  and oh ) and @xmath49 ( comparing hco@xmath12 and oh ) , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "+ note that only statistical errors are included in these estimates : @xcite estimate further systematic errors of @xmath52 towards both b0218 + 357 and pks  1413 + 135 , arising from small - scale motions of @xmath53  .",
    "@xcite carried out a simultaneous fitting of the single dish  and hco@xmath12 profiles to obtain @xmath54 towards pks  1413 + 135 and @xmath55 towards b0218 + 357 , where @xmath46 .",
    "finally , @xcite have used the conjugate nature of the 1720 and 1612  mhz satellite lines toward pks  1413 + 135 to argue that they arise in the same gas and obtained @xmath56 , where @xmath57^{1.849}$ ] .",
    "in addition to these purely radio results , the best current constraint from 21  cm and optical comparisons is from the @xmath58 absorber towards qso  1331 + 170 , which gives @xmath59 ( @xmath60 , @xcite ) .    in summary ,",
    "the current radio studies exhibit no fractional changes in the fundamental constants of @xmath61 to @xmath62 , which is not inconsistent with the optical results .",
    "the primary reason for the relatively few estimates ( or constraints ) of changes in different fundamental constants in the radio regime has been the small number of systems in which radio absorption has been so far detected (  [ currentmol ] ) .",
    "as previously noted , radio molecular absorption ( co , hco@xmath12 , oh , etc ) has so far only been detected in four cosmologically distant absorbers , with the highest redshift absorber at @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "although the situation is somewhat better for 21  cm line absorption ( see  [ targets ] ) , only a handful of absorbers are known at intermediate redshifts , with just two confirmed detections at @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "there are three main reasons for the small size of the radio absorber sample ; low sensitivity , limited frequency coverage and severe radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "while the former two factors affect observations at all radio bands , the latter is especially detrimental to observations of  21  cm and oh 18  cm lines which are redshifted to @xmath65  ghz , a range strongly contaminated by terrestrial interference . regarding the ska :    1 .",
    "sensitivity : the  21  cm and oh transitions are far weaker than the optical resonance lines .",
    "the high sensitivity of the ska is thus a critical factor in the detection of new redshifted absorption systems .",
    "this is also crucial for the precise measurements of the absorption redshifts of the different transitions .",

    "2 .   frequency and sky coverage : the ska will provide uniform frequency coverage from @xmath74  mhz to @xmath75  ghz @xcite .",
    "that is , it will be sensitive to  21  cm absorption and ground state 18  cm oh absorption at redshifts of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "this coverage also gives hco@xmath12 and co @xmath78 absorption at redshifts @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "+ the wide - band correlator will provide @xmath81  channels over a bandwidth 25% of the band centre frequency @xcite . in combination with its unrivaled low frequency coverage and the very wide field of view ( 200  square degrees at 0.7  ghz @xcite ) , this will enable highly efficient blind surveys for  and oh absorption , never before possible with an interferometer .",
    "rfi : terrestrial interference has long been the bugbear of searches for spectral lines at low frequencies , which lie outside the protected radio bands .",
    "this is particularly severe for systems at high redshift , for which the  and oh ground state lines lie below 1  ghz , where tv and radio stations , mobile phones , navigation systems , etc .",

    "this will allow one to spatially map the  and oh absorption , ensuring that comparisons between different lines are made for similar lines of sight .",

    "furthermore , many of the known dlas were selected from optical spectra , since these give a broad spectral coverage and hence enable a large redshift range to be searched efficiently . therefore present dla samples suffer from dust bias , making these poor candidates in which to search for molecules . the high sensitivity and broad spectral coverage of the ska will enable surveys to be carried out entirely in the radio regime , avoiding all previous dust extinction bias problems ( see kanekar & briggs , this volume ) .",

    ", the reddening of the quasar light is believed to be due to the presence of dust along the line of sight to the quasar ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these are therefore more likely to have high molecular abundances ( e.g. @xcite ) but , due to the dust obscuration , are very difficult objects in which to obtain high resolution optical spectra : examples of these are the 4 known molecular absorbers (  [ currentmol ] ) of which pks  1413 + 135 & b3  1504 + 377 are associated with the host and b0218 + 357 & pks  1830210 are gravitational lenses : all have background agns with colours of @xmath88 , while typical bright quasars ( including those with intervening dlas ) have far bluer colours , @xmath89 . in using red quasars , we should bear in mind , however , that :    * host absorption systems sometimes have strong velocity fields , due to their proximity to the agn , which may result in various lines arising in regions of differing velocities .",
    "it is thus important to obtain multiple estimates in individual sources .",
    "* the structure of the background emitting region can be different between centimetre and millimetre wavelengths ; this can be important for gravitational lenses since the light paths of the lines might be quite different .",
    "it is thus more prudent to compare lines arising at similar frequencies , such as the 18 cm oh ground state lines .",
    "although millimetre lines are absent in dlas ( see  [ mol ] ) , and the relative incidence of 21 cm absorption is considerably lower than in red quasars ( @xmath90 , cf .",

    "immediately , this increases the number of possible 21 cm absorbing dlas and sub - dlas by a factor of 5 in the systems currently known .",
    "furthermore , these limits significantly improve the potential of finding absorption in those dlas much more weakly illuminated at radio frequencies .    with the high quality spectra obtained from the high column density absorbers , voigt profile fitting to the line shape",

    "<S> strong evidence has recently emerged for a variation in the fine structure constant , @xmath0 , over the history of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> this was concluded from a detailed study of the relative positions of redshifted optical quasar absorption spectra . </S>",
    "<S> however , _ radio _ </S>",
    "<S> absorption lines at high redshift offer a much higher sensitivity to a cosmological change in @xmath1 than optical lines . furthermore , through the comparison of various radio transitions , , oh and millimetre molecular ( e.g. co ) lines , any variations in the proton g - factor , @xmath2 , and the ratio of electron / proton masses , @xmath3 , may also be constrained . </S>",
    "<S> presently , however , systems exhibiting redshifted radio lines are rare with the bias being towards those associated with optically selected qsos . with its unprecedented sensitivity , large bandwidth and wide field of view </S>",
    "<S> , the ska will prove paramount in surveying the sky for absorbers unbiased by dust extinction . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected to yield whole new samples of  and oh rich systems , the latter of which will prove a useful diagnostic in finding redshifted millimetre absorbers . as well as uncovering many new systems through these blind surveys , the ska will enable the detection of  absorption in many more of the present optical sample  down to column densities of @xmath4 , or @xmath5 orders of magnitude the sensitivity of the current limits . </S>",
    "<S> armed with these large samples together with the high spectral resolutions , available from the purely radio comparisons , the ska will provide statistically sound measurements of the values of these fundamental constants in the early universe , thus providing a physical test of grand unified theories . </S>"
