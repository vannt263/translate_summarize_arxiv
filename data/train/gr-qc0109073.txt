    "the experimental effort to detect gravitational waves is entering an important phase .",
    "a number of interferometric gravitational wave observatories are being built around the world  @xcite and most should be operational in the next few years .",
    "plans are already being developed to operate the next generation of interferometers ; crucial research and development is going on now to ensure that these interferometers will have the sensitivity necessary to reach distances at which multiple events may be detected per year  @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of interferometric gravitational wave observatories is limited by the fundamental noise sources inherent in the instrument .",
    "in advanced ligo , thermal noise from the internal degrees of freedom of the interferometer test masses is expected to be the limiting noise source in the middle frequency range ( @xmath5  500 hz ) .",
    "this is also the interferometer s most sensitive frequency band .",
    "thus , any additional thermal noise , such as thermal noise associated with optical coatings , will directly reduce the number of events that advanced ligo can detect .",
    "the initial ligo interferometer uses fused silica for the interferometer test masses , the beam splitter , and other optics . fused silica has been shown to have very low internal friction  @xcite and will therefore exhibit very low ( off - resonance ) thermal noise .",
    "this property , coupled with the fact that high quality , large , fused silica optics are commercially available , makes fused silica a natural choice for the initial interferometer .",
    "sapphire , which has even lower internal friction  @xcite ( although higher thermoelastic loss ) is currently proposed as the material from which to fabricate the optics for use in advanced ligo  @xcite . in addition to lower thermal noise , sapphire offers benefits due to its superior thermal conductivity , which , in transporting heat from the reflective surface of the test masses , allows a higher power laser to be used .",
    "fused silica is under continuing study as a fallback material for advanced ligo should problems arise in the development of sapphire optics .    in order to use the test masses as mirrors , optical coatings must be applied to the surface . to obtain high reflectivities , multi - layer ,",
    "dielectric coatings are used .",
    "such coatings consist of alternating layers of two dielectric materials with differing refractive indices .",
    "the number of layers deposited determines the reflectivity .",
    "it is possible to use a number of different dielectric material pairs for reflective coatings , but it has been found that coatings made with alternating layers of ta@xmath0o@xmath1 and sio@xmath0 give the necessary reflectivity while at the same time satisfying the stringent limits on optical loss and birefringence required for ligo  @xcite .",
    "the effect of these coatings on thermal noise is only now being studied .    the simplest way to predict",
    "the thermal noise is to use the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite .",
    "it states that the thermal noise power spectrum is proportional to the real part of the mechanical admittance of the test mass .",
    "explicitly @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the spectral density of the thermally induced fluctuations of the test mass surface read by the interferometer , @xmath8 is the temperature , and @xmath9 is the frequency of the fluctuations .",
    "the quantity @xmath10 is the mechanical admittance of the test mass to a cyclic pressure distribution having the same form as the interferometer beam intensity profile  @xcite . for ligo",
    ", the proposed beam profile is gaussian .",
    "the real part of the admittance , used in the theorem , can be written in terms of the mechanical loss angle , @xmath11 , of the test mass response to the applied cyclic gaussian pressure distribution . to calculate the thermal noise",
    "we must therefore obtain @xmath11 .",
    "the loss angle @xmath11 depends both on the distribution of losses in the test mass and on the shape of the deformation of the test mass in response to the applied pressure .",
    "if the distribution of losses in the test mass were homogeneous , the loss angle @xmath11 would be independent of the deformation of the test mass . in that case , one could obtain @xmath11 by measuring the loss angle associated with a resonant mode of the test mass , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the quality factor of a resonant mode . however , when the distribution of mechanical losses in the test mass is not homogeneous , this approach does not work .",
    "one way of obtaining @xmath11 would be to measure it directly .",
    "this would involve applying a cyclic gaussian pressure distribution to the test mass face and measuring the phase lag of the response .",
    "but such an experiment presents several insuperable technical difficulties and is useful mainly as a thought experiment , in which interpretation of the result would be simple .    in this paper",
    ", we give the results of another kind of experiment whose results allow us to calculate @xmath11 using elasticity theory .",
    "the measurement process is relatively straightforward : we compare the quality factor , @xmath13 , of vibrations of an uncoated sample of fused silica to the quality factor when a coating has been applied . in order to make the effect easier to measure , and to improve the accuracy of the measurements , we used thin pieces of fused silica rather than the relatively thick mirrors used in ligo .",
    "our measurements show a significant reduction of the @xmath13 due to mechanical loss associated with the coating .    in choosing to make the measurements easy to carry out , we necessarily complicated the interpretation of the results . scaling from the results of our measurements to",
    "the prediction of @xmath11 takes some work . in section  [ theory ]",
    "we describe the relationship between the measured loss angle @xmath14 and the readout loss angle @xmath11 .",
    "we are then able , in section  [ method ] , to more succinctly explain the methodology and details of our measurement process .",
    "the results of the measurements are described in section  [ results ] .",
    "the implications for ligo are discussed section  [ implications ] , and a program of future work is described in section  [ futurework ] .",
    "these results are complemented by similar results on @xmath15 coatings deposited on thick fused silica substrates .",
    "those results are published in a companion paper  @xcite .",
    "to use the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , eq .",
    "( [ fdt ] ) , to predict thermal noise , we need to calculate the real part of the mechanical admittance of the test mass .",
    "the mechanical admittance of the test mass is defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the ( real ) amplitude of a cyclic pressure distribution applied to the test mass at frequency @xmath9 , and @xmath18 is the ( complex ) amplitude of the steady state response . choosing the appropriate pressure distribution with which to excite the test mass constitutes the first step in the calculation .",
    "levin @xcite has argued that in calculating the thermal noise read by an interferometer , the appropriate pressure distribution has the same profile as the laser beam intensity and should be applied to the test mass face ( in the same position and orientation as the beam ) . in the case of initial",
    "ligo the laser beam has a gaussian intensity distribution , and a gaussian beam profile is also proposed for advanced ligo .",
    "the corresponding cyclic pressure distribution is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a point on the test mass surface , @xmath21 , @xmath9 is the frequency of interest , and @xmath22 is the field amplitude radius of the laser beam .",
    "( at the radius @xmath22 , the light intensity is @xmath23 of maximum ) . to simplify the calculation of the response @xmath18 , we make use of the fact that the beam radius is considerably smaller than the test mass radius , and approximate the test mass by an infinite half - space .",
    "this allows us to ignore boundary conditions everywhere except on the face of the test mass . for the case of homogeneous loss , liu and thorne  @xcite",
    "have shown that this approximation leads to an overestimate of the thermal noise , but that for a test mass of radius 14  cm , the error is about 30% or less for beam field amplitude radii @xmath22 up to 6  cm .    to calculate the real part of the admittance we follow levin and rewrite it in the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the maximum elastic energy stored in the test mass as a result of the excitation , and @xmath26 is the loss angle of the response . equation  ( [ yofphi ] ) holds at frequencies far below the first resonance of the test mass , provided @xmath27 , and is obtained as follows . under the conditions stated @xmath28 and the response @xmath18 to the excitation is @xmath29 substituting eqs .",
    "( [ interactionhamiltonian ] )  and  ( [ smallphilowfapprox ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ admittancedefinition ] ) and taking the real part yields eq .",
    "( [ yofphi ] ) .",
    "the strategy is then to calculate @xmath30 and @xmath26 under the pressure distribution in eq .",
    "( [ dynamicpressuredistribution ] ) .",
    "calculation of the loss angle @xmath26 requires some care since the loss angle is specific to the applied force distribution and to the associated deformation .",
    "if the material properties or intrinsic sources of loss are not isotropic and homogeneous throughout the sample , different deformations will exhibit different loss angles .",
    "since interferometer test masses do have inhomegeneous loss due to the dielectric coating on the front surface , the calculation of thermal noise depends on obtaining the value of the loss angle associated with precisely the response to the pressure distribution given in eq .  ( [ dynamicpressuredistribution ] ) . throughout this paper",
    "we will assume that losses in the substrate are always homogeneous and isotropic and that the source of inhomogeneous and anisotropic loss is the coating .",
    "the loss angle @xmath31 associated with the gaussian pressure distribution can be written as a weighted sum of coating and substrate losses . if the loss in the coating is homogeneous and isotropic within the coating ( but still different from that of the substrate ) we can write @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the maximum elastic energy stored in the sample as a consequence of the applied pressure , @xmath34 is the portion of the energy stored in the substrate , @xmath35 is the portion of the energy stored in the coating , @xmath36 is the loss angle of the substrate , and @xmath37 is the loss angle of the coating . to simplify the calculation of the energies , we make use of the fact that the frequencies where thermal noise dominates interferometer noise budgets are far below the first resonances of the test masses .",
    "thus , the shape of the response of the test mass to a cyclic gaussian pressure distribution of frequency @xmath9 is well approximated by the response to an identical gaussian pressure distribution that is constant in time .",
    "thus , to a good approximation , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 can be calculated from the deformation associated with the _ static _",
    "gaussian pressure distribution @xmath38    since we are in the limit where the coating is very thin compared to the width of the pressure distribution @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the energy density stored at the surface , integrated over the surface , and @xmath41 is the thickness of the coating .",
    "similarly , @xmath42 , giving @xmath43    if the loss angle of the coating is not isotropic , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ phireadoutisotropic ] ) must be expanded .",
    "since the coatings have a layer structure , it may not be accurate to assume that their structural loss is isotropic . to address the possible anisotropy of the structural loss we shall use the following model .",
    "the energy density @xmath44 of a material that is cyclically deformed will generally have a number of terms .",
    "we shall associate a different ( structural ) loss angle with each of these terms .",
    "for example , in cylindrical coordinates @xmath45 where @xmath46 where @xmath47 are stresses and @xmath48 are strains .",
    "the associated loss angles are @xmath49 , @xmath50 , etc . in this paper",
    "we will assume that the loss angles associated with energy stored in strains parallel to the plane of the coating are all equal .",
    "this assumption is motivated by the observation that many isotropic , amorphous materials , like fused silica , do not show significantly different quality factors for many modes even though the relative magnitude of the various terms in the elastic energy varies significantly between the modes  @xcite .",
    "the measurements made at glasgow and stanford universities further strengthen this assumption  @xcite  those measurements show no significant variation of the coating loss as the relative size of the different coating energy terms changes from mode to mode .",
    "note that since we will always have traction free boundary conditions for the problems considered here , we shall always have @xmath51 .",
    "thus we will have loss angles associated only with the following coating energy density components @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the strains and @xmath54 are the stresses in the coating .",
    "we define the loss angle associated with the energy density in parallel coating strains @xmath55 , as @xmath14 , and the loss angle associated with the density of energy in perpendicular coating strains , @xmath56 , as @xmath57 .",
    "the components of the energy density in eq .",
    "( [ energycomponents ] ) integrated over the surface of the ( half - infinite ) test mass are @xmath58 so that finally , to account for the anisotropic layer structure of the coating , eq .",
    "( [ phireadoutisotropic ] ) is replaced by @xmath59    to obtain an expression for @xmath11 we need to calculate @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath33 for a coated half - infinite test mass subject to the gaussian pressure distribution @xmath62 of eq .",
    "( [ pressuredistribution ] ) .",
    "the quantities , @xmath63 and @xmath61 involve only the stress and strain in the coating .",
    "the total energy involves the stress and strain throughout the substrate @xmath64 where @xmath48 are the strains and @xmath47 the stresses in the substrate . to obtain the stresses and strains in the coating and in the substrate we must solve the axially symmetric equations of elasticity for the coated half - infinite test mass subject to the pressure distribution @xmath62 .",
    "the general solution to these equations for an uncoated half - infinite test mass is given by bondu _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ( with corrections by liu and thorne  @xcite ) .",
    "because the coating is thin , we can , to a good approximation , ignore its presence in the solution of the elastic equations for the substrate .",
    "the strains in the coating should also not vary greatly as a function of depth within the coating , and we shall approximate them as being constant . due to axial symmetry , @xmath65 . due to traction - free boundary conditions ,",
    "@xmath66 at the coating surface , and the same must therefore hold ( to leading order ) for the entire coating .",
    "this approximation is valid , provided the poisson s ratio of the coating is not very different from that of the substrate . to obtain the non - zero stresses and strains in the coating ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 )",
    "we note that since the coating is constrained tangentially by the surface of the substrate , the coating must have the same tangential strains ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) as the surface of the substrate .",
    "also , the coating sees the same perpendicular pressure distribution ( @xmath70 ) as the surface of the substrate .",
    "these conditions , which represent reasonably good approximations for the case of a thin coating , allow us to calculate all the coating stresses and strains in terms of the stresses and strains in the surface of the substrate",

    "( [ energycomponents]-[totalenergydefn ] ) , we obtain the required quantities @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the young s modulus and poisson s ratio of the substrate , and @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the young s modulus and poisson s ratio of the coating .",

    "section  [ method ] describes ringdown experiments on coated samples in order to determine  @xmath14 .",
    "unfortunately we do nt obtain @xmath91 from ringdown experiments of samples with coatings on the surface . since the coatings experience free boundary conditions they are not greatly compressed perpendicular to the surface ( there will be some small amount of compression due to poisson ratio effects ) .",
    "therefore @xmath91 can not be easily measured in such experiments , and no measurement of @xmath91 exists at the present time . because of this , we can only obtain very rough estimates of the coating - induced thermal noise .",
    "we will set @xmath82 , but the accuracy of our thermal noise estimates will remain unknown until @xmath91 is measured .",
    "in order to estimate the coating loss component @xmath14 , we made measurements of the loss angles of fused silica samples with and without the @xmath92 high reflective coating used in ligo . a standard way of determining the loss angle at the frequency of a particular resonant mode is to measure its ringdown time , @xmath93 .",
    "this allows the calculation of the mode s quality factor @xmath13 , through @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the frequency of the resonant mode .",
    "the loss angle at the resonance frequency is the inverse of the mode s quality factor @xmath96    because of the free boundary conditions no energy is stored in strains having perpendicular components .",
    "the loss angle @xmath97 of a resonating sample after coating is therefore related to the loss angle @xmath98 of the same sample before coating by @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the energy stored in the resonance .",
    "similarly , as in section  [ theory ] , the quantity @xmath101 is the resonance energy stored in strains having no component perpendicular to the surface @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the coated surface of the sample , @xmath104 is the direction perpendicular to the surface , and @xmath105 just as in section  [ theory ] , @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ ringdownphi ] ) is the loss angle associated with energy stored in strains in the plane of the coating .",
    "because we assume that all in - plane loss angles are identical , the loss angle @xmath14 is the same @xmath14 as in section  [ theory ] , and once measured , can be substituted directly into eq .",
    "( [ thermalnoiseresult ] ) .    for each sample resonance that was found , @xmath97 and @xmath98 were measured by recording the @xmath13 with and without an optical coating , respectively . the quantity @xmath106 was then calculated either numerically or analytically , allowing eq .",

    "( [ thermalnoiseresult ] ) to obtain an interferometer thermal noise estimate .",
    "in order to reduce systematic errors in the @xmath13 measurements , we took a number of steps to reduce excess loss ( technical sources of loss , extrinsic to the sample )  @xcite .",
    "all the @xmath13 s were measured in a vacuum space pumped down to at least @xmath107  torr , and more typically @xmath108  torr .",
    "this reduced mechanical loss from gas damping . during the @xmath13 measurements",
    ", the samples were hung below a monolithic silica suspension made by alternating a massive bob of silica with thin , compliant , silica fibers .",
    "the suspensions and samples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] .",
    "( the suspension is of the same style used previously in  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite . )",
    "the piece of fused silica rod at the top of the suspension is held in a collet which is rigidly connected to the underside of a thick aluminum plate supported by three aluminum columns . between the piece of rod held in the collet and the sample was a single fused silica isolation bob .",
    "its function was to stop vibrations from traveling between the sample and the aluminum optical table from which it was suspended .",
    "the size chosen for the isolation bob depended on the sample , with the heavier sample requiring a larger bob .",
    "the two fibers in the suspension were monolithically pulled out of the neighboring parts using a h@xmath0-o@xmath0 torch .",
    "these fibers had a typical diameter of roughly 100 - 200  @xmath109 m .",
    "the normal modes of the sample were excited using a comb capacitor  @xcite .",
    "this exciter was made from two copper wires sheathed with teflon , each having a total diameter of about 1/2  mm .",
    "the two wires were then wrapped around a ground plane and placed about 1  mm from the face of the sample .",
    "special care was taken to ensure that the exciter and the sample did not touch at any point .",
    "the position of the exciter is shown in fig  [ fig : sample ] .",
    "alternating wires of the comb capacitor were given a 500  v dc voltage while the other wires were held at ground to induce a polarization in the glass sample .",
    "to reduce any eddy current damping  @xcite and to reduce the probability that polarized dust could span the gap between the sample and the exciter , the exciter was always kept more than 1/2  mm away from the sample .",
    "an ac voltage at a resonance frequency of the sample was then added to the dc voltage to excite the corresponding mode . once the mode had been excited ( `` rung up '' ) to an amplitude where it could be seen clearly above the noise , both the ac and dc voltages were removed and both exciter wires were held at ground .",
    "the sample was then allowed to ring down freely .",
    "the amplitude of excitation in the sample was read out using a birefringence sensor  @xcite or ( in the earliest measurements ) by a shadow sensor . for the birefringence sensor ,",
    "a linearly polarized beam is passed through the sample at or near a node of the resonant mode under study .",
    "modally generated stress at the node induces birefringence in the glass , which couples a small amount of the light into the orthogonal polarization , phase shifted by @xmath110 .",
    "thus , the light exiting the sample is slightly elliptically polarized .",
    "the beam is then passed through a @xmath111 wave - plate aligned with the initial polarization .",
    "this brings the phases of the two orthogonal polarization components together , converting the elliptically polarized light to a linear polarization that is rotated slightly compared with the initial polarization .",
    "the rotation angle is ( to first order ) proportional to the modal strain , and is measured by splitting the beam with a polarizing beamsplitter and monitoring the relative intensity of light in the two channels .",
    "this was done with two identical photodiodes and a differencing current - to - voltage amplifier .",
    "the output voltage oscillates sinusoidally at the resonant frequency in proportion to the modally induced strain .",
    "this signal is sent to a lock - in amplifier to demodulate it to a lower frequency , and the data is collected on a pc .",
    "the ringdown time @xmath93 was obtained by fitting the acquired signal to a damped sinusoid , or by extracting the envelope of the decay .",
    "both approaches yielded the same results , although the accuracy of the former was less sensitive to corruption from noise .",
    "a schematic drawing of the optical readout system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : readout ] .    for the shadow sensor , an led",
    "is used to cast the shadow of the fused silica suspension fiber onto a split photodiode .",
    "the led / diode pair is positioned close to where the suspension fiber is welded to the edge of the sample .",
    "the fiber near the weld point will faithfully follow the motion of the edge of the sample .",
    "as the sample resonates , the fiber s shadow moves back and forth on the photodiode at the same frequency .",
    "the amount of light falling on each half of the split photodiode changes proportionally .",
    "the currents from each half of the photodiode are then compared with a differential current - to - voltage amplifier as in the case of the birefringence sensor .",
    "the data acquisition and analysis were identical for both sensors .    for relatively rigid but transparent samples like the ones used here , the birefringence sensor is significantly more sensitive and much easier to use than the shadow sensor .",
    "the shadow sensor is better suited to more compliant samples . in both cases",
    "however , the dominant sources of broadband noise were laser noise and noise from the differential amplifier .",

    "the sample was then rehung and the @xmath13 remeasured .",
    "as can be seen from table  [ table : thickdisk ] , the coating caused a significant reduction in the quality factor . to rule out possible excess loss due to the suspension , the sample was then removed and again rehung . during this hanging attempt ( between successful hangings numbers 3 and 4 in table  [ table : thickdisk ] ) , the isolation bob fell and sheared off the bonded ear .",
    "the bond did not give ; rather , material from the sample pulled out along with the ear .",
    "a second ear was re - bonded at 180@xmath112 to the original ear .",
    "unfortunately , this ear was also sheared off in the same way during the attempt to suspend the sample .",
    "this time the source of the break occurred along the bonded surface , although some of the substrate pulled away as well . finally , a third attempt succeeded with an ear bonded at @xmath121 to the original ear ( hanging number 4 in table  [ table : thickdisk ] ) . despite the broken ears , the quality factor of the coated disk did not change significantly .",
    "the results of all @xmath13 measurements on the disk are shown in table  [ table : thickdisk ] .    since it is difficult in any measurement of high @xmath13 s to completely eliminate the extrinsic , technical sources of loss ( excess loss ) , the quality factors measured for a given sample varied slightly from mode to mode or within a single mode between different hangings . since excess loss",
    "always acts to reduce the measured @xmath13 , the best indicator of the true internal friction of a sample is the quality factor of the highest @xmath13 mode over all modes and hangings .",
    "the spread of measured @xmath13 s within single hangings was relatively small .",
    "for example ,",
    "the three @xmath13 s measured in hanging number two ( sample uncoated ) were all between @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "the twelve @xmath13 s measured in hanging three ( sample coated ) were all within @xmath124 to @xmath125 .",
    "as can be seen from tables  [ table : slide ]  and  [ table : thickdisk ] , the measured @xmath13 s also did not vary much between modes or hangings , nor between samples in the case of the two coated slides .",
    "the reproducibility of the @xmath13 s of the disk argues strongly that neither the silicate - bonded ear nor the broken ears affected the loss of the sample .",
    "the range of measured @xmath13 s for nominally similar situations is indicative of the level of the variable excess loss .",
    "thus , for all our samples , the large difference in @xmath13 between the coated and the uncoated measurements must be due to the coating , and not to statistical variation , excess loss , nor , in the case of the disk , to the broken ears .",
    "using the procedure described in sec .",
    "[ method ] , we obtained @xmath13 values from both the slides and the thick disk . to calculate @xmath14 from the measured @xmath13 s we need to know the value of @xmath126 for each measured mode of the samples . for transverse bending of the slides ,",
    "the strain is approximately @xmath127 where @xmath104 is the coordinate in the slides longest dimension , @xmath128 is the coordinate in the slides shortest dimension with the origin in the center plane of the slide , and @xmath129 is the transverse displacement of the center plane of the slides due to the bending .",
    "displacements in directions other than @xmath128 are zero for the transverse bending modes .",
    "this gives @xmath130{_{\\mathrm{slide } } } = 7.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\label{eq : muslide}\\ ] ] for all transverse bending modes of the slides .",
    "the butterfly mode of the disk is more complex , and an analytical expression for strain amplitude @xmath131 was not found .",
    "we made an fea model of this sample and calculated @xmath132 numerically .",
    "this resulted in a value of @xmath133{_{\\mathrm{disk } } } \\approx\\;\\left[\\frac{u{_{\\mathrm{coating}}}}{u } \\right]{_{\\mathrm{disk } } } = 5.3 \\times 10^{-3}\\label{eq : mudisk}\\ ] ] for the butterfly mode of the disk .",
    "the quantities needed to calculate @xmath134 from eq .",

    "( [ eq : muslide ] ) and the values in table  [ table : params ] in eq .",

    "( [ eq : mudisk ] ) and the disk @xmath13 s in table  [ table : thickdisk ] we get @xmath136    the agreement in order of magnitude between these two measured values for @xmath137 sets a scale for coating thermal noise .",
    "this allows us to make rough estimates of the effect of coating thermal noise on advanced ligo . the value of @xmath137 for the polished disk agrees within its uncertainty with the value measured for coating loss by the glasgow / stanford experiment  @xcite , despite the use of a different coating material in that experiment ( @xmath84/al@xmath0o@xmath138 as opposed to ta@xmath0o@xmath1/@xmath85 ) .",
    "this suggests that the substrate surface - polish , which is of similar quality on the disk and on the glasgow / stanford samples but less good on the slides , may be an important factor contributing to the loss .",
    "further tests and comparisons are necessary before definitive conclusions can be drawn on this issue .",
    "using eq .  ( [ zeropoissonsratio ] ) for the thermal noise due to the coated mirrors , we can now estimate the thermal noise spectrum of the advanced ligo interferometer .",
    "we calculated the range of coating thermal noise in the pessimistic case using the @xmath139 ( from the slide results ) and in the more optimistic case using @xmath140 ( from the disk result ) . in both cases",
    ", we assumed a beam spot size of 5.5  cm , which is the maximum obtainable on fused silica when limited by thermal lensing effects  @xcite .",
    "we have extrapolated our results to sapphire substrates using the known material properties of sapphire , even though we did nt measure coating loss directly on sapphire .",
    "( there have been recent measurements of @xmath14 for reo coatings deposited on sapphire  @xcite .",
    "those results are in rough agreement with the measurements described here . ) as mentioned before , the thermal noise estimates will be least accurate for sapphire substrates because sapphire coating thermal noise is likely to be dominated by @xmath57 which has not been measured .",
    "the young s modulus of sapphire is considerably higher than both ta@xmath0o@xmath1 and sio@xmath0 in bulk , so it seems likely that the coating young s modulus is considerably less than sapphire s .",
    "we are aware of a single , preliminary , measurement of @xmath74 for a ta@xmath0o@xmath1/sio@xmath0 coating  @xcite which suggests that the young s modulus of the coating is roughly equal to that of fused silica .",
    "we know of no measurements of the coating s poisson ratio .",
    "for the purposes of estimating coating thermal noise , we will set the young s modulus and poisson ratio of the coating equal to that of fused silica .",
    "table  [ table : bench ] compares the thermal noise estimates for the four cases considered ( optimistic estimates and pessimistic estimates on both fused silica and sapphire substrates ) to the thermal noise estimates when coatings are not taken into account .",
    "the corresponding noise spectra for advanced ligo are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fsbench ]  and  [ fig : sapbench ] .",
    "these were generated using the program bench1.13",
    "@xcite and show both the total noise and the contribution from the test mass thermal noise .",
    "the curves for the total noise were generated using the noise models and parameters from the advanced ligo systems design document  @xcite .",
    "the figures show that coating thermal noise is a significant source of noise in the frequency band @xmath141  30400  hz for fused silica test masses and @xmath141  40500  hz for sapphire test masses .",
    "these estimates are only preliminary indications of the level of coating induced thermal noise .",
    "the largest source of uncertainty in these thermal noise estimates is that no measurement has been made of @xmath57 .",
    "also , the young s modulus of the coating material has not been definitively measured .",
    "the half - infinite test mass approximation adds extra uncertainty and this estimate needs to be refined by taking the finite size of the coated test mass into account .",
    "in addition , there remains the possibility that the loss associated with the different terms in the energy density @xmath142 are not equal as supposed here .",
    "however , if this were the case , the apparent consistency of the loss between different modes of the samples measured at glasgow and stanford  @xcite would be spurious .",
    "we have also examined the effect of coating thermal noise on the expected sensitivity of the initial ligo interferometers that are currently being commissioned . in initial ligo",
    ", shot noise will be greater than in advanced ligo and seismic noise will be significant up to about 40  hz . due to the higher level of these other noise sources , test mass thermal noise",
    "was not expected to be a large contributor to the total noise  @xcite .",
    "the addition of coating thermal noise raises the overall noise in the most sensitive frequency band , around 200  hz , by only 4% .",
    "thus , coating thermal noise should not significantly impact the sensitivity of initial ligo .",
    "in addition to the interferometers used for gravitational wave detection , there are a number of prototype interferometer within the gravitational wave community .",
    "we have examined data from one of these  the 40  m prototype located at caltech  @xcite . in this interferometer , the beam spot size was 0.22  cm and the highest @xmath13 seen for a mirror mode was @xmath143  @xcite . using eq .",
    "( [ zeropoissonsratio ] ) with @xmath144 and @xmath145 in eq .",
    "( [ zeropoissonsratio ] ) yields a predicted thermal noise of @xmath146  m/@xmath147 at 300  hz .",
    "this is consistent with fig .  3 of @xcite .",
    "coating thermal noise is therefore a possible explanation for the broadband excess noise seen between 300  hz and 700  hz .",
    "the effect of coating thermal noise is also being explored in the glasgow  10  meter prototype , the thermal noise interferometer ( tni ) at caltech  @xcite and in the lasti prototype at mit .",
    "the measurements and predictions described here indicate that mechanical loss associated with dielectric optical coatings may be a significant source of thermal noise in advanced ligo .",
    "plans are underway for experiments that will allow us to better understand and , perhaps , reduce the coating thermal noise . a program of loss measurements on various optical coatings deposited on both",
    "fused silica and sapphire substrates has begun so that the most appropriate coating may be found .",
    "there are also plans to try and correlate the loss angle of the coating with other methods of interrogating its structure . to improve the coating thermal noise without major changes to the optics",
    ", the coating loss must be reduced .",
    "study of different dielectric materials is clearly warranted , and changes in the deposition process or post - deposition annealing might also lead to improvements .",
    "an agreement has been reached between the ligo laboratory and two optical coating companies to engage in such research .",
    "two main models exist for understanding the source of the excess loss in the coating .",
    "one is that the internal friction of the coating materials , thin layers of ta@xmath0o@xmath1 and sio@xmath0 , is high .",
    "the other model is that the excess damping comes from rubbing between the layers , and between the coating and the substrate .",
    "experiments are underway to test these models .",
    "measurement of the unknown parameters in eq .",
    "( [ thermalnoiseresult ] ) are crucial . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ theory ] , ringdown @xmath13 measurements can not determine @xmath148 due to the boundary conditions on the free vibration of a sample . a variation of the anelastic aftereffect experiment  @xcite , which will measure the relaxation rate of the coating after being stressed perpendicularly to the substrate , is being pursued at caltech  @xcite .",
    "this experiment should give a direct measurement of @xmath148 .    as seen in eq .",
    "( [ thermalnoiseresult ] ) , the coating thermal noise in an interferometer is a strong function of the laser spot size .",
    "increasing the size of the laser spot reduces the effect of the coating loss on the total thermal noise , so large spot sizes are desirable .",
    "large spots also help decrease the effect of thermoelastic damping in sapphire mirrors  @xcite , so configurations to increase the spot size are already being considered . a spot size of about 6  cm is the largest that can be achieved on the 25  cm diameter test masses while still keeping the power lost due to diffraction below @xmath149  ppm . in the case of 25 cm diameter fused silica test masses ,",
    "the largest spot size that can be achieved is about 5.5  cm , limited by thermal lensing  @xcite .",
    "larger diameter test masses and correspondingly larger spot sizes would be one way to reduce the effects of the coating loss on advanced ligo s noise .",

    "<S> , we estimate the effect of coatings on thermal noise in the initial ligo and advanced ligo interferometers . we also find that the corresponding prediction for thermal noise in the 40  m ligo prototype at caltech is consistent with the noise data . </S>",
    "<S> these results are complemented by results for a different type of coating , presented in a companion paper . </S>"
