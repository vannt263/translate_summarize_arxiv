    "chaos is now one of the most important ideas used to explain various non - linear phenomena in nature . since the research on the three body problem by poincar ,",
    "many studies about chaos in celestial mechanics and astrophysics have been done and revealed the important role of chaos in the universe@xcite,@xcite .",
    "although we know many features of chaos in newtonian dynamics , we do not know , so far , so much about those in general relativity .",
    "if gravity is strong , e.g. , a close binary system or a particle near a black hole , we have to use einstein s theory of gravitation .",
    "because the gravitational field in general relativity is non - linear , we may find a new type of chaotic behavior in strong gravitational fields , which do not appear in newtonian dynamics@xcite-@xcite . in a previous paper@xcite , we studied a criterion for chaos of a test particle motion around an @xmath5-black hole system ( or an @xmath5-naked singularity system ) and found that a local instability determined by the riemann curvature tensor provides us a sufficient test for chaos .",
    "we also found that the existence of an unstable circular orbit , which guarantees the existence of a homoclinic or heteroclinic orbit , plays a crucial role for chaos .",
    "however , the relativistic systems analyzed so far by several authors@xcite-@xcite , in which chaotic behavior of a test particle is found , are rather unrealistic@xcite-@xcite , except for the perturbed spacetimes of the schwarzschild black hole solution@xcite,@xcite . as for the other interesting cases of systems , for example ,",
    "the @xmath5-extreme black hole system@xcite-@xcite is unstable , the existence of a strong uniform magnetic field around a black hole@xcite is not likely , and naked singularities@xcite may not exist .",
    "we may wonder whether any realistic relativistic system can be chaotic and when chaos may play an important role in such a relativistic astrophysical phenomena .    in astrophysics , rotation of a system",
    "plays a quite important role .",
    "the angular momentum or spin may completely change the evolution of the system . in a dynamical system , rotation or spin",
    "is one of the most important elements and it may sometime cause chaotic behavior .",
    "for example , the hnon - heiles system , which describes the motion of a star moving in the potential of a rotating galaxy , is chaotic@xcite .",
    "we also know that some spin - orbit interaction induces chaos in newtonian gravity .",
    "this may also be true in a relativistic system such as the evolution of a binary system .",
    "the motion of coalescing binary systems of neutron stars and/or black holes is very important to study because they are promising sources of gravitational waves , which we are planning to detect by large - scale laser interferometric gravitational observatories , such as us ligo@xcite .",
    "if we will detect the signal of gravitational waves emitted from these systems and compare it with theoretical templates , we may be able to determine a variety of astrophysical parameters of the sources such as their direction , distance , masses , spin , and so on@xcite . in order to extract exact information about such sources from the observed signal",
    "we need the exact theoretical templates of the gravitational waveforms . to make such templates",
    ", it is very important to know the exact motion of sources .",
    "hence , the equations of motion in the post - newtonian expansion in terms of a small parameter @xmath6 have been studied by many authors@xcite . those can be written schematically as @xmath7 where the subscripts @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote newtonian , post - newtonian , spin - orbit coupling , 2nd post newtonian , spin - spin coupling , and radiation reaction terms , respectively@xcite ; and the superscript corresponds to the order of expansion in @xmath10 . to make sufficient templates , we may need at least the 3rd - order post newtonian contribution to obtain the s / n ratio required from the observation@xcite-@xcite .",
    "but this is still under investigation in the world .",
    "the spin effect is also important .",
    "the spin terms in eq.([1.1 ] ) , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , induce a precession of the orbital plane through the spin - orbit or spin - spin coupling , resulting in modulation of the gravitational waveforms @xcite,@xcite . in @xcite , it is also shown that the orbital plane may behave very strangely due to the spin effects .",
    "we can not verify whether or not any chaotic behavior occurs in their system .",
    "but from the studies on spin effects in newtonian dynamics , we know that a spin effect can make a motion chaotic .",
    "we then expect that a relativistic system such as a coalescing binary pulsar may also show the similar non - linear phenomena .",
    "the gravitational waveform from the system with chaotic motion will be different from a system with a regular motion , for example , a regular precession of the orbital plane as shown in @xcite .",
    "the chaos might be too strong to make a complete template of gravitational waves , or rather it might give us new information about astrophysical parameters from a time series of the observed waveforms . we will discuss this problem for a coalescing binary system with highly spinning bodies elsewhere .",
    "thus we believe that a study about spin effects on the orbital evolution of a relativistic system and its gravitational waveform is very important from the viewpoint of observations as well as of academic interest . in this paper , to clarify the spin effect on the orbital motion , especially the spin - orbit interaction , we study the motion of a spinning test particle around a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "so far , studies about a spinning test particle in relativistic spacetime have been done by many authors since the basic equations were derived by papapetrou@xcite and reformulated by dixon@xcite .",
    "corinaldesi and papapetrou already discussed a spinning test particle in schwarzschild spacetime@xcite .",
    "but , apart from the supplementary condition , from which they adopted a different equation from the present standard one , they presented the basic equations and discussed some terms with physical interpretations .",
    "they did not analyze the orbits in detail from a viewpoint of the dynamical system .",
    "kerr or kerr - newman spacetime was also analyzed by several authors@xcite-@xcite . in @xcite,@xcite and @xcite , the effective potential of the spinning particle",
    "is given and the spin effects on the binding energy are discussed .",
    "in @xcite and @xcite , the gravitational waves produced by a spinning particle falling into a kerr black hole or moving circularly around it is discussed and the energy emission rate from those systems is calculated .",
    "but in those papers they discussed only the case of the orbit in the equatorial plane or on the symmetric axis of the black hole . since we are interested in chaotic motion induced by spin - orbit coupling here , we have to discuss the most generic situation , i.e. , the orbital motion off the equatorial plane .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we shall briefly review the basic equations , i.e. , the equations of motion for a spinning test particle in relativistic spacetime , a supplementary condition and some constants of motion .",
    "we specify the background spacetime to be a schwarzschild black hole , then we write down those equations and introduce a sort of  effective potential \" , which enables us to classify the particle behavior . in section 3 , performing numerical integrations , we show that chaos occurs for a highly spinning test particle . summary and",
    "some remarks follow in section 4 .    throughout this paper",
    "we use units @xmath13 .",
    "we define the signature of the metric as @xmath14 .",
    "the equations of motion of a spinning test particle in a relativistic spacetime were first derived by papapetrou@xcite and then reformulated by dixon@xcite .",
    "those are a set of equations : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are an affine parameter of the orbit , the 4-velocity of the particle , the momentum , and the spin tensor , respectively .",
    "@xmath18 is chosen as the proper time of the particle in this paper , then @xmath19 .",
    "the multipole moments of the particle higher than mass monopole and spin dipole are ignored .",
    "it is called the pole - dipole approximation .",
    "we need a supplementary condition which gives a relation between @xmath20 and @xmath21 , because @xmath21 is no longer parallel to @xmath20 in the present case . the r.h.s .",
    "of eq.([eqn : pdot ] ) denotes a spin - orbit coupling through a strong gravitational field .",
    "we adopt the following condition@xcite , @xmath22 this condition is related to how to choose the center of mass in an extended body , and this choice gives a consistent condition@xcite . using ( [ eqn : ps0 ] ) we can write down the relation between @xmath20 and @xmath21 explicitly , that is , @xmath23 , \\label{eqn : p - v}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25^{-1/2}\\ ] ] is a normalization constant fixed by @xmath26 .",

    "regardless of the symmetry of the background spacetime , it is easy to show that @xmath2 and the magnitude of spin @xmath30 , defined by @xmath31 are constants of motion@xcite .",
    "if a geometry possesses some symmetry described by a killing vector @xmath32 associated with the symmetry , we can show that @xmath33 is also conserved@xcite .      as for the background spacetime",
    ", we assume a schwarzschild spacetime , i.e. , @xmath34 where @xmath35 with @xmath3 being the mass of the black hole . because the spacetime is static and spherically symmetric ,",
    "there are two killing vector fields , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . from ( [ eqn : killing ] )",
    ", we find the constants of motion related with those killing vectors as @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 are interpreted as the energy of the particle and the @xmath41 component of the total angular momentum , respectively . because the spacetime is spherically symmetric , the @xmath42 and @xmath43 components of the total angular momentum",
    "are also conserved .",
    "then we have two additional constants of motion as @xmath44 @xmath45 because the background is spherically symmetric , without loss of generality we can choose the @xmath41 axis in the direction of total angular momentum as @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",

    "first , we give constants of motion @xmath30 , @xmath4 and @xmath39 with which the motion of the particle is bounded to a compact region of the spacetime .",
    "we will discuss how to do it in detail in the next subsection .",
    "we set the particle on the equatorial plane @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "next , we give the spatial components of the spin tensor @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 vanishes at @xmath53 from ( [ eqn : jx2 ] ) , which means that the initial spin is perpendicular to the radial direction .",

    "note that @xmath59 and @xmath60 denote the spin anti - parallel and parallel to the positive @xmath41-direction , respectively . in this case",
    "the orbit of the particle is always restricted to the equatorial plane and chaos never occurs .",
    "we assume @xmath61 , which corresponds to the case that the @xmath41 component of spin points to the same direction as that of the total angular momentum .",
    "otherwise , the particle can not get into any relativistic region and chaos never occurs , as we will see later .    from eq .",

    "( [ eqn : mass ] ) .",
    "since we are interested in chaotic behavior of a particle orbit , we analyze a test particle which does not escape to infinity and does not fall into a black hole .",
    "therefore we have to choose appropriate parameters of the particle , @xmath39 , @xmath4 and @xmath30 .",
    "if we have an effective potential , such a choice is easy .",
    "for example , for a spinless particle traveling around a schwarzschild black hole with the orbital angular momentum @xmath70 , whose motion is restricted to a plane ( e.g. the equatorial plane @xmath71 , the effective potential of the particle is given as @xmath72 since the region where the particle with the energy @xmath39 can move is given by @xmath73 , it is easy to choose the energy @xmath39 such that the particle will move in a compact region .",
    "in the case of a spinning particle , because the spin - orbit coupling ( [ eqn : pdot ] ) is not a potential force and an additional dynamical variable , i.e. , the direction of the spin , exists , we can not find any effective potential in the 2-dimensional @xmath74-@xmath75 plane . to know the region where the particle can move , however , we do not need to find an effective potential itself .",

    "@xmath97 is reduced to the conventional effective potential for a spinless particle in a schwarzschild black hole , i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : schwapot ] ) .",
    "the derivation also shows that the particle with energy @xmath39 can move in the region of the @xmath74-@xmath75 plane such that @xmath98 .",
    "then we shall call @xmath99 the  effective potential \" of a spinning particle in schwarzschild spacetime .    the typical shape of the potential on the equatorial plane is shown in fig.1 . from this figure , we can see that the particle in the potential @xmath90 can move closer to the event horizon @xmath100 than that in the potential @xmath93 .",
    "this is because the spin - orbit interaction is a repulsive force if the spin is parallel to the orbital angular momentum and it will balance with the gravity , so that a stable periodic orbit closer to the event horizon becomes possible without falling into the black hole . if the direction of the spin is opposite , we find the reverse .",
    "such a spin - orbit interaction is induced through the gravitational interaction as the r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pdot ] ) , which breaks the integrability of the particle motion .",
    "since we are interested in chaotic behavior , a large spin - orbit interaction may be more interesting .",
    "hence , in this paper , we study only particle motion in a strong gravitational field , i.e. , in the potential @xmath90 . in what follows",
    ", we drop the subscript @xmath101 .",
    "once @xmath4 and @xmath30 are given , we can depict a contour map of @xmath99 , with which we find an allowed region where a particle with @xmath39 can move .",
    "we find that the  effective potential \" @xmath102 is classified into four types depending on @xmath4 and @xmath30 .",
    "these are given in fig.2 .",
    "in fig.2a , the potential has one saddle and one minimal point on the equatorial plane , which appears when @xmath30 is small compared with @xmath4 .",
    "since the spin effect is small , the shape of the potential is similar to that for a spinless particle .",
    "we call this potential type ( b1 ) .",
    "the orbit in this case never becomes chaotic .",
    "fig.2b shows the potential which has two saddle points off the equatorial plane and one minimal point on the equatorial plane .",
    "the saddle points are located symmetrically on opposite sides of the equatorial plane .",
    "we call this potential type ( b2 ) . for fixed @xmath4 , as @xmath30 gets larger , type ( b1 ) changes into type ( b2 )",
    ". this happens because a repulsive spin - orbit interaction is angle dependent .",
    "effective potential\"s shown in both figs.2c and 2d have no bound region , although the latter case has a saddle point on the equatorial plane .",
    "the particle will eventually fall into a black hole .",
    "we call those potentials type ( u1 ) and ( u2 ) , respectively .",
    "these potentials appear when @xmath4 is small enough , i.e. , the centrifugal force is too small to balance with the gravity .",
    "the type ( u1 ) potential is similar to that for a spinless particle . in the case of type ( u2 ) , however , the situation is slightly different .",
    "because the saddle point marked by a cross in fig.2d is minimal in the @xmath74 direction and maximal in the @xmath75 direction , a particle will gradually depart from the equatorial plane and fall into a black hole .",
    "there is a potential barrier on the equatorial plane from the repulsive spin - orbit interaction .",
    "we show in fig.3 what values of @xmath4 and @xmath30 belong to which types . because types ( b2 ) and ( u2 ) never appear in the case of a spinless particle ,",
    "we conclude that such strange behavior in those potentials is induced by a spin effect .",
    "as we will show later , we find that it is only for the type ( b2 ) that the particle motion can be chaotic .",
    "note that the value of @xmath30 at the bottom end of the ( u2 ) region is slightly smaller than @xmath103 , i.e. , at @xmath104 .",
    "hence the type ( u2 ) still appears with physically meaningful values of @xmath30 and @xmath4 , as we will discuss soon .",
    "using the bulirsch - stoer method @xcite , we integrate the equations of motion numerically for various values of parameters , @xmath39 , @xmath4 and @xmath30 and various initial configurations of @xmath105 and @xmath106 . as for the dynamical variables , we solve all components of the position vector @xmath107 , of the momentum @xmath108 , and of the spin tensor @xmath17 , and use the constraint equations ( [ eqn : ps0]),([eqn : mass]),([eqn : spin ] ) , ( [ eqn : energy ] ) @xmath48 ( [ eqn : jy ] ) to check the accuracy of our numerical integration .",
    "after @xmath109 orbital periods , which is the end of our numerical calculation , the relative errors are smaller than @xmath110 for each constraint . the methods with which we analyze the chaotic behavior are the poincar map and the lyapunov exponent .",
    "to make the poincar map , we adopt the equatorial plane ( @xmath111 ) as a poincar section and plot the point @xmath112 when the particle crosses the poincar section with @xmath113 .",
    "if the motion is not chaotic , the plotted points form a closed curve in the 2-dimensional @xmath74-@xmath114 plane , because a regular orbit will move on a torus in the phase space and the curve is a cross section of the torus . if the orbit is chaotic , some of those tori will be broken and the poincar map does not consist of a set of closed curves but the points will be distributed randomly in the allowed region . from the distribution of the points in poincar map , we can judge whether or not the motion is chaotic . the lyapunov exponent is another method to judge the occurrence of chaos and it also gives a naive estimation of the strength of chaos quantitatively .",
    "this denotes how fast the close orbits in the phase space will diverge in future .",
    "the lyapunov exponent @xmath115 is defined by @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the distance at time @xmath118 between two neighboring points in the phase space .",
    "if the orbit is chaotic , then @xmath115 will converge to some positive value , which means that the distance will diverge exponentially with a typical time scale @xmath119 . for a particle moving along a geodesic ,",
    "we can calculate the lyapunov exponent by integration of the equation of geodesic deviation ; @xmath120 where @xmath121 is a deviation vector . in the present case , however , because a spinning test particle does not move along a geodesic as discussed in section 2 , we need another way to estimate the lyapunov exponent . here , we have adopted the method developed by sano and sawada@xcite to estimate the lyapunov exponent .",
    "we prepare a time series of @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 , where @xmath126 and @xmath41 are defined by @xmath127 and @xmath128 , and calculate the lyapunov exponent from such a set of data .",
    "the way to calculate the lyapunov exponent is as follows .",
    "let @xmath129 denote a set of points on some orbit in the 4-dimensional phase space , i.e. , @xmath130 where @xmath131 is a small time interval .",
    "a set of `` deviation vectors '' @xmath132 at a point @xmath133 is defined by @xmath134 where @xmath10 is a small constant chosen appropriately .",
    "after the evolution of a time interval @xmath135 , the orbital point @xmath133 will proceed to @xmath136 and neighboring points @xmath137 to @xmath138 .",
    "the deviation vectors @xmath139 are thereby mapped to @xmath140 which transformation is described by a matrix @xmath141 . then the lyapunov exponent @xmath115 is calculated by @xmath142 where @xmath143 is a set of arbitrary unit vectors . if the system is chaotic , @xmath115 will be positive and will not depend on choice of @xmath131 , @xmath10 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "fig.4 shows the poincar maps for the total angular momentum @xmath1 and for several values of the spin @xmath30 = @xmath146 by @xmath147 . as for the spin of a particle with mass @xmath2",
    ", we usually expect that @xmath148 .",
    "in fact , for a rotating kerr black hole with mass @xmath3 and angular momentum @xmath4 , we have the inequality @xmath149 , where the equality holds in the extreme limit .",
    "therefore , for the present case , @xmath150 should be much smaller than unity for a test particle , for which we assume that @xmath151 .",
    "however , if we would extend our analysis to the case of a relativistic binary system with masses @xmath152 and @xmath153 , we may find that @xmath154 as follows .",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 should be regarded as the reduced and total masses , i.e. , @xmath155 , and for the spin of the first relativistic star 1 , @xmath156 .",
    "then we have @xmath157 for the case of @xmath158 .",
    "therefore @xmath159 can be large as unity . because the value of @xmath160 is not a mathematical special bound@xcite",
    ", we will analyze the case of @xmath161 as well in order to see the spin effect more clearly .    from figs.4a and 4b , which correspond to the type ( b1 ) potential , we find that no tori are broken .",
    "chaos never occurs . on the other hand , in the case of the type ( b2 ) potential , which is shown in figs.4c-4f",
    ", we see that some tori are broken , which means that chaos occurs for such orbits .",
    "this is the first example of chaotic behavior in the motion of a test particle in a schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "the sea of chaos spreads in these poincar sections as @xmath30 increases .",
    "we conclude that this chaotic behavior is induced by the spin effect .",
    "fig.5 shows the orbit in the 2-dimensional configuration space corresponding to each torus ( ( 1 ) @xmath48 ( 3 ) ) in fig.4d ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "the orbit ( 1 ) is almost perpendicular to the equatorial plane .",
    "the initial position is near the minimum point of the  effective potential \" .",
    "the orbit ( 2 ) is chaotic and the particle approaches the saddle points .",

    "@xmath163 gives a naive estimation for how many rotations we expect before the chaotic behavior becomes distinct .",
    "we may justify that the orbit ( 2 ) is strongly chaotic because of the large positive value of its lyapunov exponent .",
    "the reason why the lyapunov exponents of the orbits ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) converge to positive values may be either that the time series we prepared to calculate the lyapunov exponent are not sufficient or that the system is not integrable even through we can not see any break down of the tori in the poincar map .",

    "two hyperbolic fixed points in this poincar section exist .",
    "it is plausible that the type ( iv ) orbit plays an important role for the occurrence of chaos .",
    "the unstable manifold departing from one hyperbolic fixed point will join smoothly to the stable manifold of another hyperbolic fixed point .",
    "such an orbit is called a `` heteroclinic orbit '' .",
    "as @xmath39 increases from this state , the sea of chaos appears around the hyperbolic fixed points and spreads into whole poincar map .",
    "its behavior is shown in fig.8 .",
    "the chaos observed here may be caused by a `` heteroclinic tangle '' , although we need further detailed analysis .",
    "the next question is what causes the existence of type ( iv ) orbits .",

    "as @xmath30 decreases , the type ( ii ) , and then types ( iii ) and ( iv ) will vanish and only the type ( i ) orbit remains .",
    "this transition is seen in fig.4 . for the case of @xmath175 ( fig.4c )",
    ", we can not find the type ( ii ) orbit , and in the cases of @xmath176 and @xmath177 ( figs.4a and 4b ) , all orbits belong to the type ( i ) .",
    "the latter case belongs to the type ( b1 ) potential .",
    "hence , it seems that there exists some relation between the type of  effective potential \" and an appearance of types ( ii ) , ( iii ) and ( iv ) orbits .",
    "we may find some criterion for chaos using the  effective potential \" .",
    "in this paper , using the pole - dipole approximation , we study the motion of a spinning test particle near a schwarzschild black hole to clarify its dynamical properties such as a chaos .",
    "we find the motion of the particle can be chaotic under some appropriate conditions . because the motion of a spinless particle in this spacetime is never chaotic because of its integrability , this chaotic behavior is purely induced by the spin - orbit interaction . the  effective potential \" of the particle",
    "is also introduced to classify the dynamical behaviors .",
    "effective potential\"s are classified into four different types depending on the total angular momentum @xmath4 and the spin @xmath30 .",
    "when @xmath4 is large , some orbits are bounded and the  effective potential\"s are classified into two types : for type ( b1 ) one saddle point ( unstable circular orbit ) and one minimal point ( stable circular orbit ) on the equatorial plane exist for small spin ; and for ( b2 ) two saddle points bifurcate from the equatorial plane and one minimal point remains on the equatorial plane for large spin . if @xmath4 is small , no bound orbits exist and the potentials are classified into another two types : for type ( u1 ) no extremal point is found for small spin ; and for type ( u2 ) one saddle point appears on the equatorial plane , which is unstable in the direction perpendicular to the equatorial plane , for large spin .",
    "the types ( b1 ) and ( u1 ) are the same as those for a spinless particle , but the types ( b2 ) and ( u2 ) are new potentials which appear through a spin - orbit coupling . the chaotic behavior is found only in the type ( b2 ) potential .",
    "we believe that the appearance of saddle points is important , because we find chaos only for the orbits which approach the saddle points .",
    "the critical value of the spin beyond which chaos will occur is @xmath178 for @xmath179 .",
    "we also present the lyapunov exponent , which increases rapidly after the spin @xmath30 gets larger than the above critical value .",
    "this supports the use of the `` effective potential '' as a criterion for chaos .",
    "the typical value of the lyapunov exponent is about several orbital periods of the particle , which may become important in some relativistic astrophysical phenomena .    in a real astrophysical system such as a binary system ,",
    "the symmetry of the system is lower than the present case .",
    "there may be other important effects in addition to the spin - orbit interaction , which make the motion more complicated .",
    "then we may expect that chaos occurs even in the real system , or that the other effects stabilize the system and chaos will never be found .",
    "we need further analysis taking into account the other effects such as the spin - spin interaction or a force due to multipole moments , even if we adopt a test particle analysis@xcite . as for the spin - spin interaction ,",
    "we can analyze a spinning test particle in a rotating kerr black hole . in our preliminary analysis by the  effective potential \" near the equatorial plane , the critical value of the spin for chaos gets smaller as the angular momentum of the black hole becomes larger .",
    "the detailed analysis is under investigation .",
    "another important point is whether or not such a chaotic behavior , if it exists , affects any realistic astrophysical or physical phenomena .",
    "one of the important targets for such an investigation is a coalescing binary system , where we need general relativity , in particular relativistic dynamics of compact objects as we mentioned in section 1 . to examine it ,",
    "since we have studied here only the condition for occurrence of chaos , then we next have to know the evolution of the system including emission of gravitational waves .",
    "the particle traveling around a black hole emits the gravitational waves , extracting the energy and the angular momentum from the system .",
    "this will tell us whether or not the evolutionary path will get into the region of parameter space where chaos will take place .",
    "we then have to calculate the emission rates of the energy and the angular momentum , @xmath180 and @xmath181 for the present system@xcite,@xcite and follow the evolution .",
    "we would like to thank m. sasaki , m. shibata , y. sota , h. tagoshi and t. tanaka for useful discussions and thank p. haines for reading the paper carefully .",

    "in the text , we have used a spin tensor @xmath17 .",
