    "massive multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) is known to achieve high capacity performance with simplified transmit precoding / receive combining design @xcite-@xcite .",
    "most notably , simple linear precoding schemes , such as zero - forcing ( zf ) , are virtually optimal and comparable to nonlinear precoding like the capacity - achieving dirty paper coding ( dpc ) in massive mimo systems @xcite .",
    "however , to exploit multiple antennas , the convention is to modify the amplitudes and phases of the complex symbols at the baseband and then upcovert the processed signal to around the carrier frequency after passing through digital - to - analog ( d / a ) converters , mixers , and power amplifiers ( often referred to as the radio frequency ( rf ) chain ) .",
    "outputs of the rf chain are then coupled with the antenna elements . in other words ,",
    "each antenna element needs to be supported by a dedicated rf chain .",
    "this is in fact too expensive to be implemented in massive mimo systems due to the large number of antenna elements .    on the other hand ,",
    "cost - effective variable phase shifters are readily available with current circuitry technology , making it possible to apply high dimensional phase - only rf or analog processing @xcite-@xcite .",
    "phase - only precoding is considered in @xcite , @xcite to achieve full diversity order and near - optimal beamforming performance through iterative algorithms .",
    "the limited baseband processing power can further be exploited to perform multi - stream signal processing as in @xcite , where both diversity and multiplexing transmissions of mimo communications are addressed with less rf chains than antennas .",
    "@xcite then takes into account more practical constraints such as only quantized phase control and finite - precision analog - to - digital ( a / d ) conversion .",
    "works in @xcite-@xcite , however , do not consider the multiuser scenario and are not aimed to maximize the capacity performance in the large array regime .    in this paper , we consider the practical constraints of rf chains and propose to design the rf precoder by extracting the phases of the conjugate transpose of the aggregate downlink channel to harvest the large array gain in massive mimo systems , inspired by @xcite .",
    "low - dimensional baseband zf precoding is then performed based on the equivalent channel obtained from the product of the rf precoder and the actual channel matrix .",
    "this hybrid precoding scheme , termed pzf , is shown to approach the performance of the virtually optimal yet practically infeasible full - complexity zf precoding in a massive multiuser mimo scenario .",
    "furthermore , hybrid baseband and rf precoding has been considered for millimeter wave ( mmwave ) communications in works @xcite-@xcite .",
    "they share the idea of capturing",
    " dominant \" paths of mmwave channels using rf phase control and the rf processing is constrained , more or less , to choose from array response vectors .",
    "we will also show in the simulation the desirable performance of our proposed pzf scheme in mmwave channels .",
    "we consider the downlink communication of a massive multiuser mimo system as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] , where the base station ( bs ) is equipped with @xmath1 transmit antennas , but driven by a far smaller number of rf chains , namely , @xmath2 .",
    "this chain limitation restricts the maximum number of transmitted streams to be @xmath2 and we assume scheduling exactly @xmath2 single - antenna users , each supporting single - stream transmission .",
    "as discussed , the downlink precoding is divided among baseband and rf processing , denoted by @xmath3 of dimension @xmath4 and @xmath5 of dimension @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "notably , both amplitude and phase modifications are feasible for the baseband precoder @xmath3 , but only phase changes can be made to the rf precoder @xmath5 with variable phase shifters and combiners @xcite .",
    "thus each entry of @xmath5 is normalized to satisfy @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the magnitude of the @xmath9th element of @xmath5 .",
    "we adopt a narrowband flat fading channel and obtain the sampled baseband signal received at the @xmath10th user @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the downlink channel from the bs to the @xmath10th user , and @xmath13 denotes the signal vector for a total of @xmath2 users , satisfying @xmath14 = \\frac{p}{k } { \\bf i}_k$ ] where @xmath15 is the transmit power at the bs and @xmath16 $ ] is the expectation operator . to meet the total transmit power constraint ,",
    "we further normalize @xmath3 to satisfy @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 denotes the additive noise , assumed to be circular symmetric gaussian with unit variance , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "then the received signal - to - interference - plus - noise - ratio ( sinr ) at the @xmath10th user is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the @xmath22th column of @xmath3 .",
    "if gaussian inputs are used , the system can achieve a long - term average ( over the fading distribution ) spectral efficiency @xmath23.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "in massive mimo systems , zf precoding is known as a prominent linear precoding scheme to achieve virtually optimal capacity performance due to the asymptotic orthogonality of user channels in richly scattering environment @xcite .",
    "it is typically realized through baseband processing , requiring @xmath1 rf chains performing rf - baseband frequency translation and a / d conversion .",
    "this tremendous hardware requirement , however , restricts the array size from scaling large .    to alleviate the hardware constraints while realizing full potentials of massive multiuser mimo systems , we propose to apply phase - only control to couple the @xmath2 rf chain outputs with @xmath1 transmit antennas , using cost - effective rf phase shifters .",
    "low - dimensional multi - stream processing is then performed at the baseband to manage inter - user interference .",
    "the proposed low - complexity hybrid precoding scheme , termed phased - zf ( pzf ) , can approach the performance of the full - complexity zf precoding , which is , as stated , practically infeasible due to the requirement of supporting each antenna with a dedicated rf chain . the spectral efficiency achieved by the proposed pzf scheme",
    "is then analyzed .",
    "the structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] is exploited to perform the proposed hybrid baseband and rf joint processing , where the baseband precoder @xmath3 modifies both the amplitudes and phases of incoming complex symbols and the rf precoder @xmath5 controls phases of the upconverted rf signal .",
    "we propose to perform phase - only control at the rf domain by extracting phases of the conjugate transpose of the aggregate downlink channel from the bs to multiple users .",
    "this is to align the phases of channel elements and can thus harvest the large array gain provided by the excessive antennas in massive mimo systems . to clarify , denote @xmath24 as the @xmath9th element of @xmath5 and we perform the rf precoding according to @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the phase of the @xmath9th element of the conjugate transpose of the composite downlink channel , i.e. , @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "here we implicitly assume perfect channel knowledge at the bs which can potentially be obtained , e.g. , through uplink channel estimation combined with channel reciprocity in time division duplex ( tdd ) systems @xcite .",
    "we note that efficient channel estimation techniques leveraging hybrid structures and rigorous treatment of frequency selectivity are an ongoing research topic of great practical interest .",
    "then at the baseband , we observe an equivalent channel @xmath28 of a low dimension @xmath29 where @xmath30^h$ ] is the composite downlink channel .",
    "hence multi - stream baseband precoding can be applied to @xmath31 , where simple low - dimensional zf precoding is performed as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a diagonal matrix , introduced for column power normalization . with this pzf scheme , to support simultaneous transmission of @xmath2 streams , _ hardware complexity is substantially reduced , where only @xmath2 rf chains are needed , as compared to @xmath1 required by the full - complexity zf precoding_.    * quantized rf phase control : * according to , each entry of the rf precoder @xmath5 differs only in phases which assume continuous values .",
    "however , in practical implementation , the phase of each entry tends to be heavily quantized due to practical constraints of variable phase shifters .",
    "therefore , we need to investigate the performance of our proposed pzf precoding scheme in this realistic scenario , i.e. , phases of the @xmath34 entries of @xmath5 are quantized up to @xmath35 bits of precision , each quantized to its nearest neighbor based on closest euclidean distance .",
    "the phase of each entry of @xmath5 can thus be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is chosen according to @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the unquantized phase obtained from .",
    "then the baseband precoder is computed by with the quantized @xmath5 .      in this part",
    ", we analyze the spectral efficiency achieved by our proposed pzf and full - complexity zf precoding in the limit of large transmit antenna size @xmath1 assuming rayleigh fading .",
    "closed - form expressions are derived , revealing the roles different parameters play in affecting system capacity .    denoting the @xmath10th column of @xmath5 by @xmath40",
    ", we obtain @xmath41 { \\bf w s } + n_k\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] based on . as described in section [ sec : scheme ] , @xmath40 is designed by extracting the phases of @xmath42 , we thus have the diagonal term @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the @xmath45th element of the vector @xmath42 . under the assumption that each element of @xmath42 is independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "complex gaussian random variable with unit variance and zero mean , i.e. , @xmath46 , we conclude that @xmath47 follows rayleigh distribution with mean @xmath48 and variance @xmath49 .",
    "when @xmath1 tends to infinity , the central limit theorem indicates @xmath50    for the off - diagonal term , i.e. , @xmath51 , we have @xmath52 , where @xmath53 gives the complex conjugation . its distribution is characterized in the lemma below .",
    "[ lemma ] in rayleigh fading channels , the off - diagonal term @xmath54 is distributed according to @xmath55 .",
    "the proof is achieved by analyzing the real and imaginary parts of @xmath56 separately , followed by proving their independence .",
    "the proof is straightforward by definitions , and hence details are left out due to space limit .",
    "based on lemma  [ lemma ] , we derive that the magnitude of the off - diagonal term , i.e. , @xmath57 follows the rayleigh distribution with mean @xmath48 and variance @xmath49 .",
    "compared with the diagonal term @xmath58 given by , it is safe to say _ the off - diagonal terms are negligible when the transmit antenna number @xmath1 is fairly large_. this implies that the inter - user interference is essentially negligible even without baseband processing at large @xmath1 !",
    "however , we note when @xmath1 assumes some medium high values , the residual interference may still deteriorate the system performance .",
    "therefore we apply in our proposed scheme zf processing at the baseband to suppress it as in .",
    "we reason that even with zf processing at the baseband , the spectral efficiency achieved is still less than it would be if the off - diagonal terms @xmath56 s were precisely zero . in other words ,",
    "the spectral efficiency achieved by pzf is upper bounded by @xmath59 with @xmath60 $ ] , which can be characterized by the following theorem using the limit equivalence type of argument @xcite .",
