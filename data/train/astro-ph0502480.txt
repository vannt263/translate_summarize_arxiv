    "interstellar grains affect starlight which passes through them by absorbing and scattering photons .",
    "these two physical processes produce the interstellar extinction which depends on the properties of dust grains , e.g. , size distribution and composition .",
    "the description of the average extinction curve of our galaxy as a function of the wavelength from the infrared to ultraviolet can be found in savage @xcite .",
    "extinction curve shows some evident features : it rises in the infrared , it shows a slight knee in the optical , it is characterized by a bump at 2175@xmath1 , and it rises in the far - ultraviolet .",
    "these features are common between different environments .",
    "the properties of interstellar grains are different in diffuse and dense interstellar medium and thus also the extinction changes .",
    "ccm @xcite found an average extinction law valid over the wavelength range @xmath2 , which is applicable to both diffuse and dense regions of the interstellar medium .",
    "this extinction law depends on only one parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath0 parameter ranges from about 2.0 to about 5.5 ( with a typical value of 3.1 ) when one goes from diffuse to dense interstellar medium and thus @xmath0 characterizes the region that produces the extinction .",
    "if one knows the value of @xmath0 along a particular line of sight , one can obtain the extinction curve from the infrared to ultraviolet using the ccm law ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) : @xmath4 where @xmath5 , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the wavelength - dependent coefficients",
    ".        there are different ways to obtain @xmath0 using the nir or uv extinction data .",
    "wegner @xcite computed @xmath0 values for the sample of 597 ob stars with known near - infrared magnitudes .",
    "he assumed that , in the infrared spectral region , the normalized extinction curve is proportional to @xmath8 or @xmath9 . extrapolating the ir interstellar extinction curve to @xmath10 he derived @xmath0 as : @xmath11 _ { \\lambda \\longrightarrow \\infty } \\label{rvwegner}\\ ] ] gnaciski & sikorski @xcite applied the @xmath12 minimization method to compute the @xmath0 values for a sample of ultraviolet ( uv ) extinction data using the linear relation ( [ ccmlaw ] ) .",
    "geminale & popowski @xcite extended the analysis from @xcite by using non - equal weights derived from observational errors to determine @xmath13 and @xmath0 values toward a sample of stars with known ultraviolet color excesses .",
    "in this paper we use both optical / infrared ( @xmath14 ) and uv extinction data to obtain @xmath0 values for a sample of 436 lines of sight .",
    "we arrive at two main conclusions : ( i ) there are lines of sight with extinction in the optical / ir or / and uv which generically do nt follow the ccm law , and ( ii ) there are lines of sight which show an extinction curve that can not be reproduced with a single @xmath0 value in the whole wavelength range .",
    "we normalize the extinction in a standard way : @xmath15 the absolute extinction may be deduced from the relative extinction by using a total - to - selective extinction ratio @xmath0 : @xmath16 then : @xmath17 for each individual band , equation ( [ ccmlaw ] ) and ( [ eps ] ) can be combined to derive an @xmath0 value .",
    "more generally , the @xmath12 minimization can be used to obtain the @xmath0 value that provides the best ccm fit to all observed extinction data .",
    "gnaciski & sikorski @xcite suggested the following @xmath12 , which can be minimized to derive @xmath0 : @xmath18 \\right \\ } ^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the coefficients of the ccm law .",
    "following our previous work @xcite we use an improved weighted formula to find @xmath0 .",
    "we minimize the following @xmath12 : @xmath21 \\ } ^2 ~e^2(b - v ) \\label{chiweighted}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 are the weights associated with each band .    minimizing equation ( [ chiweighted ] ) with respect to @xmath0 ,",
    "we find : @xmath23 where here @xmath24 values are taken from wegner @xcite and they were computed according to : @xmath25 = \\left [ \\frac{1}{e(b - v ) } \\right]^2 \\ , \\left \\{\\sigma^2[e(b - v ) ] + [ e(\\lambda_i - v)]^2 \\ , \\sigma^2[e(\\lambda_i - v ) ] \\right \\ } \\label{sigma}\\ ] ] we estimate the error in @xmath0 from : @xmath26",
    "we use a sample of 436 lines of sight with optical / ir and uv extinction data reported by wegner @xcite . in wegner s",
    "computation the ultraviolet photometry is taken from wesselius et al .",
    "@xcite and based on _ astronomical netherlands satellite _ ( ans ) ; infrared magnitudes in @xmath27 passbands are originate mostly from the catalog of gezari , schmitz and mead @xcite and gezari et al . @xcite .",
    "the @xmath28 and @xmath29 magnitudes with accuracy of @xmath30 mag are taken from johnson @xcite and fernie @xcite . the spectral classification and @xmath31 data",
    "which have the accuracy of @xmath30 mag come from the simbad database .",
    "the effective wavelengths of the optical / ir bands are : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ; whereas the effective wavelengths of the uv bands are : 0.1549 , 0.1799 , 0.2200 , 0.2493 , and 0.3294 @xmath40 .    from the original sample ,",
    "we exclude 20 lines of sight because of their negative value of @xmath0 .",
    "negative @xmath0 values are typically the result of noisy data for the lines of sight with small @xmath41 .",
    "a useful method to test if all extinction data points are well fitted by the ccm law is to compute @xmath12 based on equation ( [ chiweighted ] ) normalized to the number of degrees of freedom , which is equal to the number of observed points minus the number of fitted parameters ( in our case the only parameter is @xmath0 ) .",
    "we note that our average @xmath42 is not equal to the expected value of 1 ; since the errors are taken from wegner ( 2002 ) and we do not want to modify them , we do not renormalize our errors requesting @xmath43 . therefore it is safer to treat our @xmath42 as a measure of a relative rather than absolute quality of the ccm fit in the optical / ir and uv wavelength ranges .",
    "we select outliers considering the tail of our @xmath42 distribution .",
    "we assume that the values @xmath44 are indicative of the lines of sight with extinction curves not well fitted by the ccm law .",
    "we find that 25% of the lines of sight of our sample shows this disagreement with the ccm law .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] displays two extinction curves representative of this group .    .",
    "the long dashed line represents the ccm curve which is the best fit to the ir data and the point - short dashed line represents the ccm curve which best follows the uv data.,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=359 ] .",
    "the long dashed line represents the ccm curve which is the best fit to the ir data and the point - short dashed line represents the ccm curve which best follows the uv data.,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=359 ]      we further analyze the lines of sight with @xmath45 for which we expect the ccm law to fit well all observed extinction data from optical / ir to uv .",
    "the usual assumption is that the knowledge of the @xmath0 value obtained from the ir part of the extinction curve may be used to obtain the entire extinction curve by using the ccm law .",
    "we critically test this assumption using two sets of @xmath0 values for each line of sight : the infrared @xmath0 ( @xmath46 ) and ultraviolet @xmath0 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "we compute the following statistic : @xmath48 + \\sigma^2[^{\\rm{ir}}\\!r_{v}]}}. \\label{deviation}\\ ] ] specifically , when @xmath49 we classify the line of sight as anomalous in the sense that the ccm law is not able to reproduce the whole extinction curve with a single value of @xmath0 .",
    "values obtained from optical / ir and uv extinction data . the points with error bars are those for which @xmath49.,width=321 ]     values are necessary to obtain a good fit to the entire extinction curve.,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=377 ]   values are necessary to obtain a good fit to the entire extinction curve.,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=377 ]    figure [ fig3 ] shows the comparison between the @xmath0 values obtained from optical / ir and uv extinction data . there is a large scatter around the 1-to-1 relationship",
    "; however , only the points with the error bars shown are those which deviate from this relation significantly ( @xmath49 ) . these 25 lines of sight need two different values of @xmath0 to match the optical / ir and uv part of the extinction curve properly .",
    "therefore , in these cases we can not universally use the ccm law to represent the entire extinction curve .",
    "six cases out of 25 have the @xmath50 higher than the @xmath51 one , and the other 19 have the @xmath50 lower than the @xmath51 one .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows two examples of such anomalous extinction curves .",
    "we use a @xmath12 minimization method to compute the @xmath0 values for a sample of 436 lines of sight .",
    "we exclude 20 cases because of their negative @xmath0 and analyze the final sample of 416 lines of sight .",
    "we derive our @xmath0 values assuming ccm law .",
    "this law aims at reproducing the entire extinction curve by using only one parameter : @xmath0 .",
    "we analyze the goodness of the ccm fit for all lines of sight using the @xmath42 statistic and test the universality of the ccm law by computing @xmath0 values separately for the optical / ir and uv part of the extinction curve .",
    "we find that for 69% of our original sample , the ccm law is able to fit well both the optical / ir and uv data .",
    "we divide the remaining 31% of cases into two groups , according to two main peculiarities : a ) the optical / ir or / and uv extinction data points can not be fitted by the ccm law ( 25% of the entire sample ) ; b ) @xmath0 values are significantly different for the two spectral regions : optical / ir and uv ( 6% of the entire sample ) .",
    "unless caused by faulty data , peculiar extinction curves result from unusual properties of dust grains .",
    "therefore , theoretical modeling of these extinction curves ( e.g. , mishchenko @xcite ; saija et al .",
    "@xcite ; weingartner & draine @xcite ) may help us to understand the processes which modify the properties of interstellar grains .",
