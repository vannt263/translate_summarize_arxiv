    "<S> it has recently been shown that a new neutral vector boson @xmath0 , with a mass of order 1  tev and weak couplings to quarks only , could explain both the anomalous values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 and the apparent excess of large @xmath3 jet events measured by the cdf collaboration . </S>",

    "<S> the predictions of the standard model are in impressive agreement with a wide range of experimental measurements . </S>",
    "<S> there are , however , several cases where theory and data appear to be in disagreement : the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 measured at lep are significantly different from the standard model prediction @xcite , and there appears to be an excess of large @xmath3 jets in the cdf data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has recently been pointed out @xcite that both these effects could be explained by introducing a new u(1 ) gauge boson ( @xmath0 ) of mass @xmath11 which mixes at the @xmath12 level with the @xmath13 and has similar couplings to quarks . by assuming universal couplings to the three fermion generations , and by adjusting the couplings to the @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath15quarks and charged leptons , the predictions for @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be brought into line with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the additional contributions to quark(anti)quark scattering mediated by @xmath16 and @xmath17channel @xmath0 exchange increase the predicted large @xmath3 jet rate at the tevatron @xmath5 collider , thus ` explaining ' the recent cdf data @xcite .    an important feature of the @xmath0 models of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is that @xmath0 vector and axial couplings to @xmath18type quarks turn out to be quite large . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the effective @xmath19 coupling is of the same order as the strong coupling : @xmath20 , which explains why the @xmath0 contribution to the large @xmath3 jet cross section is comparable to the qcd contribution . </S>",
    "<S> another implication of this , which is the subject of the present study , is that the top quark production cross section at the tevatron collider ( @xmath21 ) is similarly enhanced , i.e. the model gives rise to an additional ` anomalous ' contribution @xmath22 from @xmath23 which is the same order as the standard qcd contribution @xmath21 from @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> a precise measurement of the top cross section therefore provides an important check on the model . </S>",

    "<S> the top cross section has been studied in the context of a variety of new physics scenarios @xcite , especially since the original measurement by the cdf collaboration gave a value somewhat higher than the standard qcd prediction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> what distinguishes the present study is that we are using a model whose parameters have already been constrained , and therefore our predictions are on a firmer footing .    </S>",
    "<S> our calculations are based on the @xmath0 model introduced in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where full details can be found . </S>",
    "<S> only a brief summary is presented here . </S>",
    "<S> the neutral current sector of the electroweak lagrangian receives an additional contribution @xmath26 where the vector and axial couplings are parametrized as @xmath27 with @xmath28 etc . fixing the mass of the @xmath0 at @xmath29 , </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be adjusted to fit the measurements of @xmath25 while retaining the quality of the standard model description of other electroweak observables . </S>",
    "<S> the latter constraint forces the leptonic couplings to be small , and following ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we set them to zero . </S>",
    "<S> a fit to the lep and slc observables , including @xmath1 and @xmath2 , yields  @xcite a set of parameters which appears to be incompatible with the magnitude of the cdf jet cross section . moving these parameters within their errors , </S>",
    "<S> one is able to obtain agreement with both the lep / slc observables and the cdf data for the following values  @xcite : @xmath33 which we will refer to as ` final fit ' in the following . </S>",
    "<S> note that a variation of @xmath30 between @xmath34 and @xmath35 and of @xmath31 between @xmath36 and @xmath37 yields values for observables which are still compatible with the experimental data  @xcite .       the leading  </S>",

    "<S> it is evident that only @xmath44 annihilation will yield a sizeable contribution to the cross section .    </S>",
    "<S> our calculations of the corresponding @xmath45 cross sections use the mrs(a@xmath46 ) parton distributions of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , with @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> note that approximately 90% of the qcd cross section comes from the @xmath48 subprocess . </S>",
    "<S> we include also the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) perturbative qcd corrections to ( [ eq : sub ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the standard qcd @xmath49 cross sections these are taken from ref .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nlo corrections to @xmath22 factor into two pieces : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the @xmath52 drell - yan correction @xcite for @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the standard @xmath52 correction for the decay of a @xmath55-like vector boson into heavy quarks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quantitatively , we observe that each of the k - factors increases the lowest - order cross section by about 1520% . </S>",
    "<S> using the ` final fit ' of ( [ bestfit ] ) , we find at @xmath56 and @xmath57 : @xmath58 to be compared to the standard model prediction of @xmath59 .       </S>",
    "<S> the nlo @xmath22 cross section , for @xmath60 collisions at @xmath61 with @xmath62 and mrs(a@xmath46 ) partons @xcite , is shown as a function of the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence on the third parameter @xmath32 is very weak . </S>",
    "<S> note that that @xmath63 is disfavoured by the lep / slc data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the relative insensitivity to the parameter @xmath30 evident in the figure can be easily understood , as @xmath30 enters directly in the @xmath64 production cross sections , see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : sub ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> an increase in the production of @xmath0 bosons is however compensated by a larger amount of @xmath0 decays to @xmath65-type quarks . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , an increase in @xmath31 yields only an increase in @xmath66 , and correspondingly in the overall top cross section .       </S>",
    "<S> figure  3 shows the total cross section @xmath67 as a function of @xmath68 at the tevatron collider . </S>",
    "<S> the soild line is the standard nlo qcd prediction , the dashed line includes @xmath0-exchange with the ` final fit ' ( [ bestfit ] ) coupling parameters , and the dot - dashed ( dotted ) line correponds to a smaller ( larger ) value for the coupling parameter @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the data points are from cdf @xcite and d0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the standard model prediction for @xmath21 is still within the range of the experimental errors , it can clearly be seen that the additional @xmath22 contribution improves the agreement between data and theory . furthermore , more accurate measurements of @xmath68 and the cross section , which should become available in the near future , will provide an additional constraint on the parameter @xmath31 .    </S>",
    "<S> the confirmation of an excess in the measured top cross section must of course take into account the theoretical uncertainty in the standard model prediction . </S>",
    "<S> there are three major sources of such uncertainty : unknown higher - order perturbative corrections , the value of @xmath69 and parton distributions . </S>",
    "<S> a very complete study of this issue has recently been performed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( see also earlier discussions in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ` best estimate ' of the top cross section ( at @xmath70 ) and its error from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is @xmath71 note that the central value in ( [ eq : best ] ) agrees with our result for @xmath21 given above . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , the error is approximately @xmath72 over the allowed top mass range . the important point to note </S>",
    "<S> is that the ` final fit ' prediction for @xmath22 is about three times larger than the error on the qcd prediction .    </S>",
    "<S> given the uncertainties in the standard qcd prediction and in the data , it is important to investigate other properties of the final state which could help distinguish an anomalous contribution to the cross section . </S>",
    "<S> examples include the angular distributions of the top quarks and their decay products , as emphasized in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .       </S>",
    "<S> notice in particular that the rapidity distribution of the @xmath73 quark produced in @xmath74 is _ not _ forward  backward symmetric , in contrast to the standard production mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> however the simplest discriminator of the anomalous and standard contributions is the distribution in the invariant mass @xmath75 of events containing @xmath38 pairs , shown in fig .  4 for @xmath56 , @xmath76 and the parameters of ( [ bestfit ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line denotes the standard model prediction , the additional contribution due to the exchange of the ` final fit ' @xmath0 is indicated by the dotted line , and the solid line is the sum of these . just as for the excess in the single jet inclusive distribution  @xcite , the @xmath0 contribution is visible as an enhancement of the measured cross section at large invariant masses . </S>",
    "<S> note that the final - state invariant mass at next - to - leading order can include the contribution from additional gluon emission where appropriate . in practice , </S>",
    "<S> the invariant mass distribution of @xmath38 pairs will also depend on kinematical cuts and the jet definition used in the event reconstruction . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed study of these effects is beyond the scope of this work .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the new - physics model proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to explain the anomalies in the measurements of @xmath25 at lep / slc and the cdf large @xmath3 jet cross section predicts a significant enhancement of the top quark production cross section . </S>",
    "<S> the ` final fit ' estimate of the increase is about three times larger than the theoretical uncertainty in the standard prediction , and should be readily observable given the expected increase in the precision of the experimental measurement in the future . </S>"
