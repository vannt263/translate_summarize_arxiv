    "the massive stellar clusters in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) possess a wide range of ages ( 10@xmath4 to 10@xmath5 yr ) though as well as a well - established dearth of clusters with ages between @xmath6 3 - 4@xmath710@xmath8 and 10@xmath5 yr ( see , e.g. , da costa 1991 , baumgardt et al .",
    "this makes the lmc an important testing ground for theories of how massive star clusters form and evolve both dynamically and possibly chemically . because of the proximity of the lmc , massive clusters of intermediate - age ( i.e. , 1 - 3 gyr ) are readily accessible for detailed study .",
    "the cluster ngc1846 ( m @xmath9 10@xmath10 m@xmath11 ; age @xmath9 1.8 gyr ; [ fe / h ] @xmath9 -0.4 ) was found by mackey & broby nielsen to possesses a colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) exhibiting two distinct main - sequence turn - offs ( mstos ) . the width of the red giant branch is small , which indicates there is no significant internal spread in [ fe / h ] .",
    "the cluster is consistent with the presence of two stellar populations with ages 300 myr apart @xcite .",
    "searches of the hst / acs archive @xcite revealed another 10 lmc clusters of ages between 1  2.5 gyr that exhibit unusual mstos .",
    "the msto region of these clusters may be bifurcated or much more extended than can be accounted for by photometric errors .",
    "binary stars seem to contribute at different levels to the broadness around the msto @xcite .",
    "similarly stellar rotation appears in some works as an unlikely solution @xcite , or performs equally well like age spread @xcite , or is preferred @xcite .",
    "milone et al .",
    "report that 11 of 16 ( i.e. ( @xmath12)% ) intermediate - age clusters possess this phenomenon .",
    "keller , mackey & da costa have simulated stellar populations with a range of luminosities and star formation histories .",
    "these simulations show that a cluster with bimodal star formation history featuring a 200 myr hiatus would be undetectable to existing acs photometry of lmc clusters once the age of the cluster exceeds 2.3 gyr .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that in increasingly older clusters , the difference in age between the constituent stellar populations represents a diminishing fraction of the cluster age , hence the multiple populations become increasingly harder to resolve photometrically .",
    "the fact that the multiple msto phenomenon is only detected in globular clusters ( gcs ) younger than 2.5 gyr is therefore not unexpected . indeed , it is plausible that the production of multiple populations is an evolutionary phase for the majority of massive clusters , although it is not seen in some massive younger clusters @xcite .",
    "the currently known multiple msto clusters possess another outstanding feature .",
    "the extended main sequence turnoff ( emsto ) clusters show a tendency to have larger core radii than non - emsto clusters @xcite .    in order to investigate the frequency of occurrence of the multiple msto phenomenon in the lmc cluster population",
    ", we have built an age and luminosity limited sample with which to examine if the formation of multiple populations is a general phase of cluster evolution , one possibly related to the puzzling multiple populations seen in ancient galactic gcs ( see for example , carretta et al .",
    "2010 ) . in this paper",
    "we present a photometric dataset for a number of clusters in the sample for which high - quality cmds were previously unavailable .",
    "although we defer a detailed analysis on the presence or absence of the extended msto phenomenon in these clusters to a forthcoming paper ( keller et al .",
    "2014 , in prep . )",
    ", we investigate the status of each cluster on the basis of matching single stellar population ( ssp ) isochrones to their respective cmds .",
    "we thus provide estimates of the mean cluster ages , which will assist in the analysis of the role of cluster core radii , the degree of msto broadness , dynamical status of the clusters , etc . results from this program for the lmc cluster ngc2209 have been published in keller et al . .",
    "in section 3 we present the derived cluster photometry , followed by derivation of the fundamental cluster parameters of age and metallicity , and spatial extent in section 4 .",
    "we obtained images of 14 candidate lmc intermediate - age clusters with the gemini south telescope and the gmos - s instrument through @xmath13 and @xmath14 filters . in imaging mode",
    "gmos - s has a field - of - view of approximately 5.5@xmath15@xmath7 5.5@xmath15 at a scale of 0.146 arcsec per ( 2x2 binned ) pixel .",
    "the detector is a 3@xmath71 mosaic of 2k@xmath74k eev ccds .",
    "observations were executed in queue mode ( under programs gs-2011a - q-43 , gs-2012a - q-15 and gs-2013a - q-17 ) which enabled the data to be obtained in excellent seeing ( 0.35 `` to 0.78 '' fwhm ) and under photometric conditions .",
    "the log of observations is presented in table 1 , where the main astrometric , photometric and observational information is summarized .",
    "several images were taken in each filter ( @xmath0 ) , as we judged that the dynamic range and accuracy required to suit our science goals could be met most efficiently this way .",
    "most of the selected fields have shorter and longer exposure times to provide coverage of bright cluster red giant branch stars as well as stars at least two magnitudes below the msto in order to search for the presence of the extended msto phenomenon .",
    "the data reduction followed the procedures documented in the gemini observatory webpage and utilized the gemini / gmos package in iraf .",
    "we performed overscan , trimming , bias subtraction , flattened all data images , etc .",
    ", once the calibration frames ( zeros and flats ) were properly combined .",
    "observations of photometric standard stars were included in the baseline calibrations for gmos .",
    "the standard stars were chosen from the standard star catalog calibrated directly in the sdss system ( smith et al .",
    "2014 , http://www-star.fnal.gov ) . for program gs-2011a - q-43 , the standard fields 160100 - 600000 , e5@xmath16b , e3@xmath16a .",
    "pg1633 + 099 , and lse259 were observed during the same nights as for ngc2155 , 2161 , 2162 , 2173 , 2203 , 2209 , 2213 , and 2231 .",
    "ngc2231 was observed during two different nights , so that we used its photometry for additional controls .",
    "the calibrated photometry for ngc2173 and 2209 have been previously published in keller et al . .",
    "for program gs-2013a - q-17 , the standard fields 060000 - 300000 and 160100 - 600000 were observed during the same night as for clusters sl244 , 505 , 674 , and 769 .",
    "images of standard star fields were not observed as a regular - based instrument monitoring ( program objects ngc2249 and hodge6 ) .",
    "however , we have paid particular care when using the calibrations derived ( see also , http://www.gemini.edu/node/10625?q=node/10445 ) assuming that the atmospheric extinction was close to the median value for cerro pachon .    independent magnitude measures of standard stars were derived per filter using the apphot task within iraf , in order to secure the transformation from the instrumental to the sdss @xmath17 standard system .",
    "standard stars were distributed over an area similar to that of the gmos array , so that we measured magnitudes of standard stars in each of the three chips .",
    "the relationships between instrumental and standard magnitudes were obtained by fitting the following equations :    @xmath18    @xmath19    where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ( j=1,3 ) are the fitted coefficients , and @xmath22 represents the effective airmass .",
    "we solved the transformation equations with the fitparams task in iraf .",
    "the root - mean square ( rms ) errors from the transformation to the standard system were 0.011 mag for @xmath13 and 0.013 for @xmath14 , respectively , indicating excellent photometric quality .",
    "the stellar photometry was performed using the star - finding and point - spread - function ( psf ) fitting routines in the daophot / allstar suite of programs @xcite . for each frame , a quadratically varying psf was derived by fitting @xmath6 60 stars , once the neighbours were eliminated using a preliminary psf derived from the brightest , least contaminated 20 - 30 stars .",
    "both groups of psf stars were interactively selected .",
    "we then used the allstar program to apply the resulting psf to the identified stellar objects and to create a subtracted image which was used to find and measure magnitudes of additional fainter stars .",
    "this procedure was repeated three times for each frame . finally , we computed aperture corrections from the comparison of psf and aperture magnitudes by using the neighbour - subtracted psf star sample . after deriving the photometry for",
    "all detected objects in each filter , a cut was made on the basis of the parameters returned by daophot .",
    "only objects with @xmath23 @xmath22 , photometric error less than 2@xmath24 above the mean error at a given magnitude , and @xmath25sharp@xmath25 @xmath2 0.5 were kept in each filter ( typically discarding about 10% of the objects ) , and then the remaining objects in the @xmath13 and @xmath14 lists were matched with a tolerance of 1 pixel and raw photometry obtained .",
    "we combined all the independent instrumental magnitudes using the stand - alone daomatch and daomaster programs . as a result",
    ", we produced one dataset per cluster containing the @xmath26 and @xmath27 coordinates for each star , and different ( @xmath13,@xmath28 ) pairs according to the number of frames obtained per filter .",
    "we did not combine ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) shorter with longer exposures , but treat them separately .",
    "the gathered photometric information were standardized using equations ( 1 ) to ( 2 ) .",
    "we finally averaged standard magnitudes and colours of stars measured several times .",
    "the resulting standardized photometric tables consist of a running number per star , equatorial coordinates , the averaged @xmath13 magnitudes and @xmath28 colours , their respective rms errors @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the number of observations per star .",
    "we adopted the photometric errors provided by allstar for stars with only one measure .",
    "tables 2 to 15 provide this information for ngc2155 , 2161 , 2162 , 2173 , 2203 , 2209 , 2213 , 2231 , 2249 , hodge6 , sl244 , 505 , 674 , and 769 , respectively . only a portion of table 2 is shown here for guidance regarding their form and content .",
    "the whole content of tables 2 - 15 is available in the online version of the journal on oxford journals , at http://access.oxfordjournals.org .",
    "we first examined the quality of our photometry in order to evaluate the influence of the photometric errors , crowding effects and the detection limit on the cluster fiducial characteristics in the cmds . to do this , we performed artificial star tests on a long exposure image per filter and per cluster to derive the completeness level at different magnitudes .",
    "we used the stand - alone addstar program in the daophot package @xcite to add synthetic stars , generated bearing in mind the colour and magnitude distributions of the stars in the cmds ( mainly along the main sequence and the red giant branch ) , as well as the radial stellar density profiles of the cluster fields .",
    "we added a number of stars equivalent to @xmath6 5@xmath31 of the measured stars in order to avoid significantly more crowding synthetic images than in the original images . on the other hand ,",
    "to avoid small number statistics in the artificial - star analysis , we created five different images for each one used in the artificial star tests . utilizing the tabulated gains for the gmos devices we were able to simulate the poisson noise in each stellar image .",
    "we then repeated the same steps to obtain the photometry of the synthetic images as described above , i.e. , performing three passes with the daophot / allstar routines , making a cut on the basis of the parameters returned by daophot , etc .",
    "the errors and star - finding efficiency was estimated by comparing the output and the input data for these stars - within the respective magnitude and colour bins - using the daomatch and daomaster tasks . in fig .",
    "1 we show the resultant completeness fractions as a function of magnitude for ngc2173 , which is a representative cluster in our sample when considering simultaneously the largest extent , crowding and number of measured stars . fig .",
    "1 shows that the 50@xmath31 completeness level is reached at @xmath0 @xmath6 23.5 - 25.0 , depending on the distance from the cluster centre . on the other hand , by using the theoretical isochrones of marigo et al . and the lmc distance modulus @xmath32 = 18.49 @xcite",
    ", we concluded that the msto of star clusters with ages between 1 - 3 gyr is located at @xmath13 @xmath6 20 - 21 mag .",
    "thus , we conclude that our photometry is able to reach the 50% completeness level 2 - 3 magnitudes below the msto for the innermost cluster regions ( distance to the cluster centre @xmath33 @xmath34/4 where @xmath34 is a measure of the cluster size defined in the next section ) .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath24(@xmath13 ) , and @xmath24(@xmath28 ) is represented by error bars in the cmds shown in figs .",
    "in fig . 2 - 15 we show the colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of stars in the field of ngc2155 , 2161 , 2162 , 2173 , 2203 , 2209 , 2213 , 2231 , 2249 , hodge6 , sl244 , 505 , 674 , and 769 , respectively .",
    "the most obvious traits in each cluster cmd are the long cluster main sequence ( ms ) which extends over a range of approximately 4 - 5 mag in @xmath13 , the cluster red clump ( rc ) and red giant branch ( rgb ) . in some cases , a populous cluster sub - giant branch ( sgb )",
    "is also visible ( e.g. , ngc2155 ; fig .",
    "the rc is not tilted in any of the studied clusters - except sl244 - so that differential reddening can be assumed to be negligible along the lines of sight .",
    "however , ngc2162 , 2209 , and 2249 have clear dual rcs , a feature seen in star clusters exhibiting the emsto phenomenon @xcite .",
    "keller , mackey & da costa discuss the parameters of the emsto evident in ngc 2209 .",
    "the consequences of the detection of the emsto phenomenon or otherwise in this set of clusters is the focus of a separate paper ( keller et al .",
    "2014 in prep . ) , for which we will use as inputs the mean cluster age estimates derived in the present work .",
    "we determined the cluster geometrical centres in order to obtain circular extracted cmds where the fiducial features of the clusters could be clearly seen .",
    "the coordinates of the cluster centres and their estimated uncertainties were determined by fitting gaussian distributions to the star counts in the @xmath26 and @xmath27 directions for each cluster .",
    "the fits of the gaussians were performed using the ngaussfit routine in the stsdas / iraf package .",
    "we adopted a single gaussian and fixed the constant to the corresponding background levels ( i.e. stellar field densities assumed to be uniform ) and the linear terms to zero .",
    "the centre of the gaussian , its amplitude and its full width at half - maximum acted as variables .",
    "the number of stars projected along the @xmath26 and @xmath27 directions were counted within intervals of 40 pixel wide .",
    "in addition , we checked that using spatial bins from 20 to 60 pixels does not result in significant changes in the derived centres .",
    "cluster centres were finally determined with a typical standard deviation of @xmath35 10 pixels ( @xmath6 0.3 pc ) in all cases .",
    "we then constructed the cluster radial profiles based on star counts previously performed within boxes of 40 pixels a side distributed throughout the whole field of each cluster .",
    "the selected size of the box allowed us to sample statistically the stellar spatial distribution .",
    "thus , the number of stars per unit area at a given radius , @xmath36 , can be directly calculated through the expression :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent the number of stars and boxes included in a circle of radius @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "note that this method does not necessarily require a complete circle of radius @xmath36 within the observed field to estimate the mean stellar density at that distance .",
    "this is an important consideration since having a stellar density profile which extends far away from the cluster centre allows us to estimate the background level with high precision .",
    "this is necessary to derive the cluster radius ( @xmath41 ) , defined as the distance from the cluster centre where the combined cluster plus background stellar density profile is no longer readily distinguished from a constant background value within 1-@xmath24 of its fluctuation , which typically led to uncertainties of @xmath24(@xmath41 ) @xmath9 2 pc .",
    "it is also helpful to measure the full width at half - maximum of the stellar density profile , which plays a significant role - from a stellar content point of view - in the construction of the cluster cmds .",
    "the resulting density profiles expressed as number of stars per unit area are shown in the upper right panel of figs . 2 - 15 .",
    "in these figures , we show the region around the centre of each cluster out to @xmath6 2.7 ( @xmath9 1100 pixels ) .",
    "the background region surrounding each cluster was delimited between the observed field boundaries and the cluster radius from the cluster s centre .",
    "the vertical lines represent the radii at the full width at half - maximum ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath41 values were estimated by eye on the cluster radial profile plots according to the above definition , whereas @xmath34 were calulated from the half - maximum of the cluster radial profiles ( @xmath24(@xmath34 ) @xmath9 0.5 pc ) .",
    "notice that these radial scales are not precisely defined , but that small changes in their values does not materially affect the appearence of the cmds .",
    "we then constructed three cmds covering different circular extractions around each cluster as shown in figs . 2 - 15 ( upper left , bottom left , and bottom right panels ) .",
    "the panels in the figures are arranged , from top to bottom and from left to right , in such a way that exhibit the stellar population variations from the innermost to the outermost regions of the cluster fields .",
    "we start with the cmd for stars distributed within @xmath36 @xmath2 @xmath34 , followed by that of the cluster regions delimited by @xmath36 @xmath2 @xmath41 and finally by the adopted field cmd .",
    "the latter was built using a ring centred on the cluster of area @xmath42@xmath34@xmath43 and internal radius @xmath41 .",
    "we used the cmds corresponding to the stars within @xmath34 as the cluster fiducial sequence references , and used those for @xmath41 to match theoretical isochrones .",
    "some field star contamination is unavoidable , though .",
    "however , when comparing field and cluster cmds , the differences in stellar content become noticeable , as can be seen from the upper left and bottom right panels of figs . 2 - 15 .",
    "particularly , the field cmds contain much fewer stars and are dominated by relatively older ms star populations , although composed of stars within a wide age range .",
    "the cmds of the cluster sample , on the other hand , exhibit distinct rcs characteristic of intermediate - age star clusters around 1 - 3 gyr old .",
    "we computed @xmath44 colour excesses by interpolating the extinction maps of burstein & heiles using a grid of ( _ l_,b ) values , with steps of @xmath45(_l_,b ) = ( 0.01@xmath46,0.01@xmath46 ) covering the observed fields .",
    "bh maps were obtained from hi ( 21 cm ) emission data for the southern sky .",
    "they furnish us with @xmath44 colour excesses which depend on the galactic coordinates .",
    "we obtained between 80 and 100 colour excesses per cluster field .",
    "then , we built histograms and calculated their centres and full width at half - maxima ( fwhms ) . since the fwhms values turned out to be considerably low ( @xmath6 0.03 mag ) , we concluded that the interstellar absorption is uniform across the cluster fields .",
    "our adopted reddenings are essentially identical to the bh reddenings tabulated for each cluster in ned .",
    "five of our clusters in the periphery of the lmc also have reddenings tabulated in ned on the system of schlafly & finkbeiner , which is a recalibration of the schlegel , finkbeiner & davis reddenings . for these clusters",
    "the mean difference between our adopted reddenings and those from schlafly & finkbeiner is 0.01 mag with a standard deviation of 0.02 mag .",
    "table 16 lists the adopted @xmath44 colour excesses , from which we computed the @xmath47 and @xmath48 values using the @xmath47/@xmath44 = 1.621 and @xmath48/@xmath44 = 3.738 ratios given by cardelli , clayton & mathis .    as for the cluster distance moduli , subramanian & subramanian",
    "find that the average depth for the lmc disc is 3.44 @xmath35 1.16 kpc , so that the difference in apparent distance modulus - clusters could be placed in front of , or behind the lmc - could be as large as @xmath45(@xmath32 ) @xmath6 0.15 mag , if a value of 50 kpc is adopted for the mean lmc distance @xcite . since a difference of 0.05 in log(@xmath3 )",
    "( the difference between two close isochrones in the bressan et al .",
    "2012 models used here ) implies a difference of @xmath6 0.25 mag in @xmath13 , we decided to adopt the value of the lmc distance modulus @xmath32 = 18.49 @xmath35 0.09 reported by de grijs et al .",
    "( 2014 ) for all the clusters .",
    "our simple assumption of adopting a unique value for the distance modulus for all the clusters should not dominate the error budget in our final results .",
    "in fact , when overplotting the zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) on the cluster cmds , previously shifted by the corresponding @xmath47 and @xmath32 = 18.49 , excellent matches were generally found .    in order to estimate the cluster ages , it must be taken into account that cluster metallicity plays an important role when matching theoretical isochrones .",
    "the distinction is mainly evident for the evolved rc and rgb phases .",
    "zamss are often less affected by metallicity effects and can even exhibit imperceptible variations for a specific metallicity range within the expected photometric errors .",
    "we took advantage of the available theoretical isochrones computed for the sdss photometric system to estimate cluster ages .",
    "we used the isochrones calculated with core overshooting included by the padova group @xcite .",
    "when we chose subsets of isochrones for different z metallicity values to evaluate the metallicity effect in the cluster fundamental parameters , we adopted the most frequently used value of [ fe / h ] = -0.4 dex ( z = 0.006 , z@xmath11 = 0.0152 ) for the intermediate age lmc clusters studied to date ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their fig",
    "we then selected a set of isochrones and superimposed them on the cluster cmds , once they were properly shifted by the corresponding lmc distance modulus .",
    "notice that by matching different ssp isochrones we do not take into account the effect of the unresolved binaries or stellar rotation but focus on the possibility that any unusual broadness at the msto might come from the presence of populations of different ages .",
    "mackey et al . , milone et al . , goudfrooij et al . ,",
    "piatti , among others , showed that a significant fraction of unresolved binaries is not enough to reproduce the emstos seen in their studied clusters , while stellar rotation has not driven the whole msto broadness in all the cases @xcite .",
    "since the purpose of this work consists in introducing the high - quality deep photometric data set and provide with mean cluster ages from which we will study any possible extended msto cluster candidate , the matching of ssp isochrones results overall justified .",
    "moreover , by closely inspecting the matched cluster msto regions we have a hint for any uncommon broadness in the studied cluster sample .    in the matching procedure with a naked eye , we used seven different isochrones , ranging from slightly younger than the derived cluster age to slightly older .",
    "finally , we adopted the cluster age as the age of the isochrone which best reproduced the cluster s main features in the cmd ( namely , the cluster s ms , rcs and/or rgbs ) .",
    "we noted , however , that the theoretically computed bluest stage during the he - burning core phase is redder than the observed rc in the cmds of some clusters , a behaviour already detected in other studies of galactic and magellanic cloud clusters ( e.g. , piatti et al .",

    "these age uncertainties are thought to mainly represent the overall dispersion along the sgb , rgb as well as the position of the rc , rather than a measure of the msto spread .",
    "nevertheless , in most of the clusters the adopted age uncertainties relatively reflect the observed msto broadness , thus implying a weaker chance for the emsto phenomenon .",
    "note , however , that we have assigned the same mean age error to ngc2173 and ngc2209 -even though only the latter was confirmed as an emsto cluster by keller et al .",
