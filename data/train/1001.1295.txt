    "quantum memory  @xcite , which stores the coherent information of logical qubits , is an essential ingredient of quantum information processings , and plays crucial roles in almost all fields of quantum information science  @xcite . basically , a quantum memory consists of macroscopically many physical qubits which encode the state of few logical qubits .",
    "each logical basis should be encoded on macroscopically distinct physical states since otherwise the indistinguishability of logical bases is easily destroyed by local errors . on the other hand , in order to store quantum coherent superposition of these logical bases , the memory must be able to have superposition of macroscopically distinct states of physical qubits .",
    "to maintain such superposition is very difficult .",
    "first , if the size of the memory is infinite , such macroscopic superposition is impossible since superposition of different phases is just a classical mixture of them in an infinite system  @xcite .",
    "second , even in finite systems , such macroscopic superposition is usually very unstable  @xcite .",
    "therefore , how to balance those two contradictory demands ( i.e. , classical information must be encoded on macroscopically distinct states but we also need superposition of them ) is one of the most challenging problem in the implementation of quantum memory .",
    "the code space of a quantum memory is often realized as the lowest - energy eigenspace of a many - body hamiltonian .",
    "one of the most beautiful examples is kitaev s toric code  @xcite .",
    "kitaev introduced a four - body hamiltonian which exhibits a topological phase transition .",
    "the ground states are degenerated and energetically isolated from the excited states .",
    "each of these ground states corresponds to different topological phases in the thermodynamic limit , and therefore logical bases encoded on these degenerate ground states are immune to local errors .",
    "logical qubit operations are performed by applying long strings of pauli operators on physical qubits , which means that logical operations are non - local .",
    "although kitaev s toric code is highly sophisticated and indeed has inspired plenty of successive studies  @xcite , it is not easy to implement a scalable toric code in a laboratory since non - local operations are required .",
    "a complementary approach is therefore also important from the practical point of view .    in this paper",
    ", we study the less elaborate but more feasible quantum memory , namely the @xmath0 quantum memory .",
    "although the @xmath0 quantum memory is too primitive to be a complete and universal quantum memory , it is still valuable to study it , since the simple structure of this memory means feasibility in a laboratory and the possibility of capturing the essence of theoretical aspects of quantum memory . in general , a quantum memory must have a large coherence for some values of a control parameter in order to store a coherent information of logical qubits .",
    "therefore , we analyze the coherent properties of the @xmath0 quantum memory at low temperature , by using the method of detecting superposition of macroscopically distinct states developed in refs .  @xcite .",
    "we show that the @xmath0 quantum memory can have superposition of macroscopically distinct states for some values of a control parameter and at sufficiently low temperature , and that the code states have no instability except for the inevitable one .",
    "however , we also see that the power of superposition of macroscopically distinct states in this memory is limited by space and time .",
    "these results suggest that the @xmath0 quantum memory is of limited use as a prototype of a small quantum memory .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the method of detecting superposition of macroscopically distinct states . in sec .",
    "[ zero ] , we study the zero - temperature case .",
    "we next study the finite - temperature case in sec .",
    "[ finite ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ discussionrvb ] , we briefly discuss the rvb quantum memory , which is an improvement of the @xmath0 quantum memory , and the relations of our results to the concept of symmetry breaking in statistical physics in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the method of detecting superposition of macroscopically distinct states in quantum many - body states  @xcite .",
    "let us consider an @xmath2-site lattice ( @xmath3 ) where the dimension of the hilbert space on each site is an @xmath2-independent constant , such as a chain of @xmath2 spin-1/2 particles . throughout this paper ,",
    "@xmath4 means @xmath5    for a given pure state @xmath6 , the index @xmath1 @xmath7 is defined by @xmath8 = o(n^p),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the maximum is taken over all hermitian additive operators @xmath9 . here",
    ", an additive operator @xmath10 is a sum of local operators @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a local operator acting on site @xmath13 .",
    "for example , if the system is a chain of @xmath2 spin-@xmath14 particles , @xmath12 is a linear combination of three pauli operators , @xmath15 , and the identity operator @xmath16 acting on site @xmath13 . in this case , the @xmath17-component of the total magnetization @xmath18 and the @xmath19-component of the total staggard magnetization @xmath20 are , for example , additive operators .",
    "the index @xmath1 takes the minimum value 1 for any product state @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a state of site @xmath13 ( this means that @xmath23 is an entanglement witness for pure states ) .",
    "if @xmath1 takes the maximum value 2 , the state contains superposition of macroscopically distinct states because in this case the relative fluctuation of an additive operator does not vanish in the thermodynamic limit : @xmath24 and because the fluctuation of an observable in a pure state means the existence of a superposition of eigenvectors of that observable corresponding to different eigenvalues .",
    "for example , the @xmath2-qubit ghz state @xmath25 which obviously contains superposition of macroscopically distinct states , has @xmath26 , since @xmath27    it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that a state having @xmath26 is unstable against a local noise from the environment and a local measurement , whereas a state having @xmath28 is stable .",
    "there is an efficient method of calculating index @xmath1  @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that the hilbert space on each site is two - dimensional one .",
    "generalizations to higher dimensional cases are immediate .    for a given pure state @xmath6 , let us define the @xmath29 hermitian matrix called the variance - covariance matrix ( vcm ) by @xmath30 where @xmath31 ; @xmath32 ; @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are pauli operators on site @xmath13 .",
    "since the vcm is hermitian , all eigenvalues are real .",
    "let @xmath36 be the largest eigenvalue of the vcm . then @xmath37 is satisfied  @xcite , which means that we have only to calculate @xmath36 to obtain the value of index @xmath1 .",
    "since a matrix of a polynomial size can be diagonalized within a polynomial steps , @xmath36 is obtained efficiently by numerical calculations .",
    "let us first study the zero - temperature case .",
    "we consider the one - dimensional periodic chain of @xmath2 qubits .",
    "the code space of the @xmath0 quantum memory is stabilized by the  bond operators \" @xmath38  @xcite @xmath39 which act on the  virtual qubits \" ( or  dual qubits \" ) embedded on bonds , where @xmath40 . since @xmath41 stabilizers of the @xmath0 quantum memory are generated by @xmath42 bond operators @xmath43 , which means that the code space is @xmath44 dimensional subspace .",
    "the centralizers of these stabilizers are generated by @xmath45 and @xmath46 they work as the logical bit flip and logical phase , respectively .",
    "the code space is also specified as the lowest - energy eigenspace of the two - body hamiltonian @xmath47 it is obvious that two degenerate separable ground states of this hamiltonian are macroscopically distinct with each other , and therefore the indistinguishability of logical bases , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , is not destroyed by local errors .    ideally , the logical hadamard operation @xmath50 which is the essential ingredient of various quantum information processings , is realized by using the logical @xmath51 operation , eq .",
    "( [ logicalx ] ) . however , such non - local operation is not easy to experimentally implement",
    ". therefore , it is reasonable to try to manipulate the quantum memory in the local way : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is an external control parameter .    from the perron - frobenius theorem  @xcite ,",
    "the ground state of this hamiltonian is non - degenerate if @xmath54 .",
    "it is also known that this hamiltonian exhibits the quantum phase transition at @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "let us denote the exact ground state of @xmath56 corresponding to the external parameter @xmath53 by @xmath57 , and evaluate index @xmath1 of @xmath57 for various @xmath53 . in fig .",
    "[ emax.eps ] , the largest eigenvalue @xmath36 of the vcm versus @xmath2 is plotted by changing the value of @xmath53 .",
    "this figure shows that          in order to see the structure of the superposition , the probability distribution @xmath63 of @xmath64 in @xmath65 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ 13datap_z.eps ] for @xmath66 .",
    "this figure suggests that the ground state is , in a rough picture , a superposition of two macroscopically distinct states : @xmath67 where @xmath68 are some states satisfying @xmath69 , respectively .      by seeing the eigenvector of the vcm corresponding to the largest eigenvalue @xmath36",
    ", we can also know that the additive operator which gives the maximum fluctuation in @xmath60 is @xmath70 according to ref .",
    "@xcite , this means that @xmath60 is unstable against the local noise described by the interaction hamiltonian @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a noise parameter of a long wavelength .",
    "although this noise is inevitable since we need the superposition of macroscopically distinct logical bases , we can still show that @xmath60 has no other instability than this inevitable one . in fig .",
    "[ tim_e2.eps ] , we plot the second largest eigenvalue @xmath73 of the vcm versus @xmath2 for @xmath65 . from this figure",
    "we obtain @xmath74 which means that @xmath65 is stable against all noises of the type @xmath75 except for the case of eq .",
    "( [ unstablenoise ] ) .        as is seen in fig .",
    "[ tim_gap.eps ] , the energy gap @xmath76 between the exact ground state and the first excited state for @xmath77 decays exponentially fast as @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , it is physically allowed to take a linear combination of the exact ground state and the first excited state for sufficiently large @xmath2 .      from eq .",
    "( [ e_0 ] ) and the analogy with the physics of the single two - level atom system , the rough picture of the first excited state @xmath79 is expected to be @xmath80 and therefore the superposition latexmath:[\\ ] ] for any translationally invariant @xmath9 .    as is pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the low - temperature coherence properties of quantum memory is closely related to the obscured symmetry breaking in statistical physics .",
    "indeed , our results in this paper are considered as improvement of the previous results , since hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hoftim ] ) is equivalent to that of the transverse ising model  @xcite in condensed matter physics .",
    "( for example , this model was used to describe the order - disorder transition in some double - well ferroelectric systems , such as potassium dihydrogen phosphate ( @xmath132 ) crystals  @xcite . )    first , by numerical calculations , we have explicitly shown for the first time how the macroscopic coherence properties of the exact ground state changes when the transverse magnetic field is changed ( fig .  [ emax.eps ] ) .",
    "we have also visualized the structure of the macroscopic superposition in the exact ground state ( fig .",
    "[ 13datap_z.eps ] ) , and seen that the exact ground state is approximately an equal weight superposition of two symmetry - broken phases .",
    "second , we have shown that only @xmath64 fluctuates macroscopically in the @xmath61 phase ( fig .",
    "[ tim_e2.eps ] ) .",
    "since the ground state is symmetric , this means that the second moment of @xmath64 is of @xmath133 in that phase . in terms of statistical physics",
    ", this means that @xmath64 is the unique order operator in this phase , which is , to the author s knowledge , a new result .",
    "third , we have shown that the equal - weight superposition of the exact ground state and the first excited state has @xmath28 ( fig .  [ tim_1data_2data_emax.eps ] ) .",
    "this means that the superposition of the exact ground state and the first excited state is ergodic .",
    "although similar results have been obtained , the advantages of our result are ( i ) instead of the trial state , we have directly used the first excited state to show the ergodicity , ( ii ) our result that the fluctuation is of @xmath134 is stronger than eq .",
    "( [ komashowed ] ) , and ( iii ) we have shown the ergodicity for any additive operator , whereas only translationally invariant additive operators are considered in the previous studies .",
    "( a disadvantage of our result is that it is less general since we have used numerical calculations . ) in summary , to consider index @xmath1 for the ground states of many - body hamiltonians in condensed matter physics is very useful for the study of the foundation of statistical physics .",
    "note that @xmath113 is a simultaneous eigenvector of @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath64 corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 , since a singlet is a simultaneous eigenvector of @xmath17 , @xmath137 , and @xmath19 component of the total magnetization corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 .",
    "since each of the states @xmath138 for @xmath139 has no component in the eigenspace of @xmath64 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath140 , they are orthogonal to @xmath141 . in the same way ,",
    "@xmath142 for @xmath139 are orthogonal to @xmath141 since each of them has no component in the eigenspace of @xmath135 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath143 .",
    "hence we have shown eq .",
