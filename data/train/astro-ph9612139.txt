    "the problem of the possible incompleteness of the t tauri population was first addressed by herbig ( 1978 ) who noted that there was an embarrising deficit of t tauri stars ( tts ) of age greater than @xmath0 2 myr in nearby star forming regions .",
    "herbig introduced the possibility of a missing population of  post - t tauri \" stars with ages older than @xmath0 5@xmath110 myr and searches to identify such stars have been conducted thereafter . however , the census of the low - mass stellar population is still a matter of debate .",
    "some authors argue that the combination of classical and weak tts observed _ within _ or _ close to _",
    "molecular clouds represents the whole stellar population in regions like the taurus - auriga complex ( e.g. hartmann et al .",
    "1991 ; gomez et al .",
    "other authors have stressed the opposite viewpoint whereby the dominant stellar population is still to be determined , since many young stars can be found at large distances from the parent molecular clouds . in particular , feigelson ( 1996 ) has used the recent discovery made by the rosat all sky survey of many weak tts tens of parsecs away from nearby low - mass star forming complexes to argue that the census is far from being complete because of insufficient spatial coverage . if the newly found stars are genetically linked to those found within the boundaries of molecular clouds , then the total number of low - mass stars formed in such regions would increase dramatically .",
    "assuming that the star formation has been taking place at a constant rate over the last 10 million years ( i.e. during the typical lifetime of a molecular cloud ) , feigelson ( 1996 ) estimates that the predicted deficit of stars older than 25 myr exceeds hundreds or thousands of tts",
    ". one obvious implication of this conclusion is that the star formation efficiency of molecular clouds would be much higher than the few percent currently estimated ( e.g. cohen & kuhi 1979 ) .    in this paper",
    "we take the opposite point of view and argue that the lack of older stars in low - mass star forming regions is a consequence of the star formation process itself rather than the dispersal of stars outside well - surveyed regions . the main idea behind this statement",
    "is that it is erronoeus to think of star formation as an instantaneous process during the lifetime of a molecular cloud , but that rather it takes a long time for establishing the proper initial conditions conducive to gravitational collapse and star formation .",
    "we identify this timescale with the ambipolar diffusion time in weakly ionized media , as suggested by various authors ( e.g. mouschovias 1976 ; shu , adams & lizano 1987 , sal ) .",
    "it is also shown that this timescale is similar to the estimated lifetime of molecular clouds and that therefore the probability of finding a large population of older stars is _ intrinsically _ very small .",
    "the star formation efficiency within a star forming region is _ not _ constant as a function of time , but it is very low initially and increses steeply at later times .",
    "nevertheless , the overall value of the efficiency , few percent , is small since it is limited by the mechanisms that determine the survival of a molecular cloud complex .",
    "we do not discard the possibility that a certain fraction of young stars can indeed be found at large distances from molecular clouds , but we dispute the conclusion that such a population would outnumber the known tts by the estimated factors ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the post - t tauri problem is basically a false problem .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the main theoretical ideas behind dense cloud core formation and ambipolar diffusion . following other authors",
    ", we believe that the formation of low - mass stars takes place within cloud cores which are cold , @xmath3  k , dense , @xmath4  @xmath5 , and weakly ionized , @xmath6 ( e.g. myers & benson 1989 ) .",
    "measurements of the magnetic field strength indicate the presence of fields of 1050 @xmath7 g",
    "( myers & goodman 1988 ) , which could provide the bulk of the support to the cloud cores .",
    "these clouds appear to be magnetically subcritical , i.e. their mass - to - flux ratio is less than a critical value @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the magnetic flux threading the cloud , and @xmath10 its mass .    for a frozen - in magnetic field ,",
    "subcritical clouds can not undergo gravitational collapse if the magnetic flux is conserved .",
    "however , collapse can occur by redistribution of magnetic flux by ambipolar diffusion in a lightly ionized medium , where the ion - neutral collisional coupling becomes less effective and magnetic forces drive the ionized matter through the neutrals , thus decoupling the field from the neutral matter ( mestel & spitzer 1956 ) .",
    "this process does not alter the magnetic field threading a cloud but simply redistributes mass among the central flux tubes of a cloud ( mouschovias 1976 ) .",
    "the process of ambipolar diffusion is negligible in cloud envelopes because of the relatively high degree of ionization ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "a good approximation for the density of ions , valid in a wide range of molecular cloud densities , is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the ion and neutral densities , respectively , and @xmath15  @xmath16  g@xmath17 is a constant . under these conditions",
    "ambipolar diffusion sets in gradually and its characteristic timescale in a molecular cloud core of size @xmath18 and density @xmath14 is ( e.g. shu  1992 ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the ion - neutrals drift velocity and @xmath21  @xmath22  g@xmath23  s@xmath23 is the ion - neutrals drag coefficient . for typical molecular cloud cores , the ambipolar diffusion time is long compared to the dynamical free - fall time , by a factor of order 817 ( sal , mckee et al .",
    "indeed , myers & goodman ( 1988 ) have shown that , using a crude virial equilibrium model of thermal and magnetic support against gravity for the core , the timescale for ambipolar diffusion always exceeds 10 myr for cloud radii greater than @xmath24  pc and magnetic field strengths less than @xmath25  @xmath7 g .",
    "fiedler & mouschovias ( 1993 ) have presented detailed calculations of the formation and contraction of isothermal , self - gravitating , magnetic cores in axisymmetric geometry over a wide range of densities .",
    "their models clearly show that , for the assumed reference physical quantities ( @xmath26  @xmath5 , @xmath27 g ) , the quasi - static contraction lasts about 15 myr : at that point the central mass - to - flux ratio has increased by a large factor ( 1050 ) and exceeds the critical value for gravitational collapse .    in order to estimate the typical timescale for the subsequent phase of gravitational collapse and protostellar accretion",
    ", we can use the basic results obtained by shu ( 1977 ) and stahler , shu & taam ( 1980 ) for the case of the collapse of a singular isothermal sphere .",
    "in such scenario , the mass accretion rate is given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the effective sound speed , and @xmath30 a constant of order unity .",
    "for a core at @xmath31  k that has lost its magnetic support , the mass accretion rate is of order @xmath32 few @xmath33  yr@xmath23 .",
    "thus , the typical accretion timescale ( which is comparable to the free fall time ) is @xmath34 for solar mass stars .",
    "such a time is much shorter than the core formation timescale .",
    "thus , in a given molecular cloud , by the time the cores acquire the proper conditions to initiate gravitational collapse , most of them must have already formed a low - mass star ( e.g. beichman et al .",
    "1986 , lizano & shu 1989 ) .",
    "the failure to recognize the existence of a long gestation period preceding the actual stellar birth and infancy , is , in our opinion , the basic misconception at the origin of the problem of post - t tauri stars .",
    "in this section , we present estimates of the lifetimes of molecular clouds . as it will be shown below",
    ", the main point is that such lifetimes are of the same order of those for core formation that we have just derived .",
    "since the issue of cloud ages is not as rigourous as that of cloud core formation , we will present only the main arguments used to estimate ages of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) and dark cloud complexes .    as for the gmcs ,",
    "the current consensus is that they should not be much older than the crossing times of their constituent clumps .",
    "elmegreen ( 1985 ) and falgarone & puget ( 1986 ) have estimated that in the case of clumpy magnetic molecular clouds , the lifetime is about 25 cloud crossing times , or approximately @xmath35  myr using typical cloud parameters ( @xmath36 and @xmath37  pc ) .",
    "these analyses are applicable to the initial phases of large molecular complexes , prior to the formation of massive o and b stars .    a more direct estimate of cloud age can be obtained from the age of the associated star clusters .",
    "elmegreen ( 1985 ) shows that the total age of a molecular cloud is within a factor of 2 or 3 of the age of the stars that it contains .",
    "the ages of the ob associations are in the range @xmath3820  myr .",
    "for some systems , it is also possible to follow the change in cloud properties as a function of the age of the associated cluster / association .",
    "the large scale co survey made by leisawitz , bash & thaddeus ( 1989 ) around 34 open clusters has shown a marked decline in the cloud mass within 25 pc , or 10 cluster angular diameters , of clusters by an age of 5 myr .",
    "clusters older than @xmath010 myr do not have molecular clouds associated with them more massive than a few times @xmath39 , and by an age of @xmath40  myr the clouds have almost completely disappeared .",
    "now , since very few giant molecular clouds do not contain a massive association , the first massive o stars , which are responsible of the wreackage due to powerful winds and radiative heating , must have been formed soon after the formation of a cloud complex .",
    "thus , the estimate of @xmath41 1020  myr provides a measure of the lifetime of a typical molecular complex .",
    "let us now turn to the case of dark cloud complexes such as taurus - auriga , @xmath42 ophiucus and chamaeleon where the issue of cloud dispersal is more relevant to the problem of the post - t tauri stars .",
    "we have already noted that empirically about half of the well studied dense ammonia cores have collapsed to form low - mass stars .",
    "the age of the deeply embedded objects is of the order of few 10@xmath43  yr , but beichman et al .",
    "( 1986 ) argue that they may be even younger , based on the timescale for star - core separation and on the analysis histograms of t tauri ages .",
    "in addition , myers et al .",
    "( 1987 ) have estimated the timescale for the dispersal of circumstellar obscuration by comparing the frequency of occurrence of obscured and optically revealed tts in taurus - auriga .",
    "they derive obscuration times of order 10@xmath43 yr , comparable to the dynamical time of the associated co outflows . finally , the very high incidence of the outflows among embedded sources in cores , together with the large momentum and kinetic energy suggest that cores can be disrupted or dispersed typically in a few @xmath44  yr ( myers et al .",
    "1988 ) . in the absence of such energetic events and due to the lack of nearby massive stars , the small clouds found in these complexes can in principle last for a very long time .",
    "however , there is no direct evidence for such long lives at present , and even if the above arguments have overestimated the actual efficiency of the core dispersal mechanism(s ) , it is reasonable to assume that such entities have lifetimes no longer than few myr .    to summarise",
    ", we have shown that typical lifetimes for cloud complexes vary between few and few tens of myr , with the latter being a more realistic estimate . considering the results of the previous section , we can define a total time for star formation @xmath45 , and since the last two terms are much smaller than @xmath46 , we derive the following inequality of timescales : @xmath47    where @xmath48 , @xmath46 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 represent the cloud lifetime , the timescale for core formation by ambipolar diffusion , the timescale for protostellar accretion , and the timescale for core dispersal",
    ". we will now discuss the implications of such a result .",
    "in addressing the problem of the post- ( or older ) tts , the usual assumption is made that _ if _",
    "star formation has been continuous at the present rate for at least 10 myr , then the samples of known tts represent only a small fraction of the actual population . feigelson ( 1996 )",
    "predicts that hundreds or thousands of such stars should exist and concludes by saying that  the mistery of the missing older tts is more dramatic today that when herbig ( 1978 ) first raised the issue \" . in fact , the age distributions of tts lacks such older objects while , if anything , they indicate a tendency for stars to appear very young . in modern terms , many stars in the h - r diagram appear at , or very close to , the stellar birthline for low- and intermediate - mass stars ( stahler 1983 ; palla & stahler 1990 ) .",
    "hartmann et al .",
    "( 1991 ) have noticed that in the case of the taurus - auriga complex  star formation has been synchronized to a remarkable degree \" . from the analysis of other star forming regions , feigelson ( 1996 ) concludes that this synchronism should be extended to clouds in all directions around the sun , a fact that is considered implausible given the variety of internal and external conditions in each of them .    other possible explanations , involving short - lived star formation , episodic star formation , uncertainties in age determinations due to poorly known evolutionary tracks , survey incompleteness can not account for the sharp decline in population for ages greater than @xmath51  myr .",
    "the suggestion that older tts exist in large numbers well outside the currently known star forming regions , and the evidence for such a population provided by the rosat all sky survey represent therefore an almost natural explanation to the problem .",
    "however , the picture of star formation we have outlined in the previous sections indicates that in fact there is no need to invoke such a large population of older stars and that , pushed it to the extreme consequences , a problem of the missing population does not exist at all .",
    "a potential objection to this picture concerns the observed paucity of _ inactive _",
    "( i.e. not forming stars ) molecular clouds relative to _ active _ clouds in the solar neighborood .",
    "if the duration of the star formation phase is much shorter than cloud s typical lifetimes , then the ratio @xmath18 of active / inactive molecular clouds may become very small : for example , feigelson ( 1996 ) finds that multiple short bursts of star formation would lead to @xmath52  @xmath53 , in contradiction with the observational evidence that only few clouds in the solar neighborhood are inactive .",
    "we do not address here the issue of the _ duration _ of the phase of copious star formation in a molecular cloud ; rather , we want to stress the fact that the time _ required _ for the onset of this phase may represent , under typical conditions , a substantial fraction of the entire cloud s lifetime .",
    "let us define the fraction @xmath54 of active molecular clouds as @xmath55 , and let @xmath56 be the fraction of inactive clouds , such that @xmath57 .",
    "therefore @xmath58 so that if we accept the suggestion that @xmath59 , then the ratio @xmath18 of active to inactive clouds becomes of order unity , or larger . with our fiducial values",
    "@xmath60  myr , @xmath61  myr , a fairly comfortable ratio @xmath62 is obtained . failing to grasp the essential fact that _ star formation is a slow process _ , one would reach the opposite conclusion that @xmath63 .",
    "there is another aspect of the observations that our model should also address . in the same star forming regions , old stars with ages 530 myr",
    "are indeed found , albeit not with the frequency predicted by the constant star formation models .",
    "if star formation is a slow process , how can we explain their presence ?",
    "returning to the definition of @xmath46 , we see that this time scale depends rather sensitively on the local physical conditions of the medium . in a given molecular cloud ,",
    "spatial fluctuations of e.g. the magnetic field strength or geometry , or ionization fraction , can induce naturally a spread in star formation times .",
    "considering all the rather sensitive dependence of the coefficient @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) on the metal depletion of the ambient gas , that may well lead , in very dense and depleted regions , to a value smaller by an order of magnitude than our adopted value ( umebayashi & nakano  1990 ) .",
    "thus , many different kinds of spatial fluctuations may introduce a natural spread in the formation times of the cores and hence in the age distribution of the stellar population .",
    "this spread is well documented both in low - mass star forming regions and in young stellar clusters",
    ".    a broader implication of the scenario we have outlined is that the star formation rate of molecular clouds is not constant nor continuous in time , but a steeply increasing function of time .",
    "the rate in the early phases of the life of a cloud complex is very low , because most of the gas is at such low densities that gravitational collapse can not occur , and becomes quite large at later times ( after the _ typical _ ambipolar diffusion timescale ) .",
    "however , the short timescales associated with cloud destruction act as a self - regulatory mechanism to keep the overall rate at the low observed values of few percent . unlike models based on the dispersal of tts , we do not need to invoke a revision of the low efficiencies originally estimated by cohen & kuhi ( 1979 ) , nor a higher proportion of stars born in bound open clusters .",
    "in other words , we agree with the viewpoint that the current census of the young stellar population is close to being complete , and there is no need to invoke a large population of missing young stars .",
    "we are thus left with the last question : what are then the dispersed t tauri stars detected by rosat ?",
    "we partake the view that _ some _ stars can escape from their parent clouds both because of the velocity dispersions they inherit from the gas and because of dynamical ejections due to few body encounters during the formation stages .",
    "but we disagree with the interpretation that these stars are the majority of those detected by rosat . in our view",
    ", it is more likely that these stars represent a mixture of older stars resulting from a previous episode of large scale star formation , and of younger stars formed tens of parsecs away from major clouds within cloudlets that have been dissipated .",
    "indeed , some x - ray sources detected far away from the @xmath42 ophiucus core have been tentatively identified with young class  i stellar objects ( casanova et al .",
    "1995 ) , coeval with the majority of the cluster stars .",
    "future observations will unravel the true origin and nature of this interesting class of stars .",
    "we would like to acknowledge useful discussions with the participants at the iv french - italian meeting on star formation , organized by dr .",
    "montmerle , during which most of the ideas presented here have been discussed .",
    "this project has been funded by cnr grant n.  96/00317 ."
