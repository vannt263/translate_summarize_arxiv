    "one of the strongest lines of evidence for an accelerating universe is the observation that @xmath6 type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) are @xmath7 mag fainter than predicted by an @xmath8 cosmology ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999",
    "; riess 2000 ) .",
    "however , there are several effects such as gray dust ( aguirre 1999 ) or luminosity evolution ( drell , loredo , & wasserman 2000 ) that could mimic the effect of a cosmological constant .",
    "riess et al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter r2001 ) have recently concluded that sn 1997ff , one of the two sne discovered by gilliland , nugent , & phillips ( 1999 ) in the hubble deep field north ( hdfn ; williams et al .",
    "1996 ) , has a redshift of @xmath9 making it the highest redshift probable sn  ia identified so far .",
    "( the sn  ia classification is based on the nature of the host galaxy , an evolved , red elliptical ; also the observed colors and temporal evolution of sn 1997ff are most consistent with those of sne  ia . )",
    "this object is particularly interesting because at @xmath10 the preceding epoch of deceleration causes objects to appear brighter than a persistence of astrophysical effects invoked as alternative hypotheses to explain the sn  ia faintness at @xmath11 .",
    "r2001 measured a distance modulus for sn 1997ff which is more than a magnitude brighter ( @xmath12 mag brighter assuming the spectroscopic indication of @xmath13 ) than the predictions from uniform gray dust or toy evolution models , disfavoring these alternatives to a cosmological constant .",
    "lewis & ibata ( 2001 ) stated that sn 1997ff could be magnified by a factor of @xmath14 by two ",
    "elliptical systems \" close to its line of sight .",
    "r2001 anticipated a magnification of @xmath15 mag from these same sources , in good agreement with lewis & ibata .",
    "as we see below , these are in fact two spiral galaxies ( # 709 and # 720 in table 1 ) which magnify sn 1997ff by only @xmath16 mag , about half of the value estimated by lewis & ibata , and close to the upper limit inferred by r2001 for these two galaxies from the induced shear on the host - galaxy shape and orientation .",
    "m \" ortsell , gunnarsson , & goobar ( 2001 ) also tackled this problem using rest - frame @xmath17-band and ultraviolet luminosities to infer the masses of the lenses . after performing numerous ray - tracing simulations",
    ", they concluded that the range of possible magnifications was too large to obtain a firm value for the distance modulus of sn 1997ff based on our current knowledge of the lensing galaxies .",
    "here we use the superb photometric and positional information provided by the hdfn to estimate velocity dispersions for the galaxies lensing sn 1997ff using the tully - fisher ( tf ) and faber - jackson relations , and correcting for evolution effects . with this information ,",
    "we calculate , using the multiple - plane lensing formalism ( schneider , ehlers , & falco 1992 , hereafter sef ) , the magnification of sn 1997ff and the shear induced on the host galaxy , which is fully compatible with its expected intrinsic shape .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the environment of sn 1997ff , and identifies the main lensing foreground galaxies .",
    "the multiple - plane lens formalism is discussed in   3 , while",
    "  4 presents our estimates of the magnification and shear .",
    "section 5 summarizes our main results and conclusions .",
    "figure 1 shows the positions of the galaxies around sn 1997ff with @xmath18 mag and @xmath19 .",
    "the coordinates , i d number , and @xmath20 magnitudes are taken from the fernndez - soto , lanzetta , & yahil ( 1999 ) catalog and photometric redshifts have been obtained using the bpz package ( bentez 2000 , http://acs.pha.jhu.edu/txitxo/bpz.html ) .",
    "table 1 lists the characteristics of the galaxies contributing significantly to the magnification of sn 1997ff .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath21 absolute magnitudes @xmath22 and @xmath23 have been estimated from the @xmath24 and _",
    "hst_/nicmos f110w and f160w magnitudes , respectively .",
    "this was done by generating k - corrections based on their spectral type , drawn from the 4 main coleman , wu , & weedman ( 1980 ) galaxy types and two kinney et al .",
    "( 1996 ) starbursts ; the k - corrections are @xmath25 mag in the case of the four strongest lenses .",
    "the circular velocities @xmath26 for the late - type galaxies in table 1 have been estimated using the recent results of ziegler et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , which measure the @xmath17-band tf slope and normalization for @xmath27 mag , @xmath28 fors deep field galaxies  quite similar , in statistical terms , to our lens sample .",
    "we assume a relative error of @xmath29 estimated from the scatter around the best fit in figure 3 of ziegler et al .",
    "these errors are propagated in the calculation of the einstein radius , etc . , and",
    "account for most of the uncertainty in the final value of the magnification . as a cross - check ,",
    "we have also estimated the expected values of @xmath26 usingthe @xmath21-band tf relation , as determined by giovanelli et al .",
    "( 1997 ) : the results are very similar to those of the ziegler et al .",
    "( 2002 ) @xmath17-band tf .    to determine their circular velocities with another method , we observed galaxies # 709 and # 720 on 2001 may 29 and 30 ut with the echellette spectrograph and imager ( esi ; sheinis et al .",
    "2002 ) on the keck - ii 10-m telescope .",
    "a slit width of @xmath30 was chosen , which gave an instrumental resolution of @xmath31 70 km s@xmath32 ( based on fits to the night - sky emission lines ) .",
    "the spectrum of galaxy # 709 shows strong , single - component emission lines with fwhm = 78 km s@xmath32 ( corrected for the instrumental resolution ) .",
    "the spectrum of galaxy # 720 exhibits double - peaked emission - line profiles , with a peak - to - peak splitting of 200 km s@xmath32 . after correcting for the assumed inclination angles ( @xmath33 for galaxy # 709 and @xmath34 for galaxy # 720 ) , we derive circular velocities of 70 and 110 km s@xmath32 , respectively .",
    "in contrast , the respective circular velocities expected according to the tf relation are substantially higher , @xmath35 and @xmath36 km s@xmath32 ( table 1 ) .",
    "although both values are marginally consistent at the @xmath37 level , these results , especially in the case of # 709 , seem to support the conclusion of gillespie & van zee ( 2002 ) that emission lines from the central regions of star - forming galaxies can underestimate the total circular velocity by a factor of @xmath38 .",
    "hence , we consider the circular velocities derived from the keck data to be lower limits on the true quantities , and we use the tf estimates and their uncertainties in the calculations below . taking the spectroscopic results at their face value would yield @xmath39 mag from the # 709#720 pair alone , which can be considered to be the lower limit on the magnification of sn 1997ff .",
    "note also that this would make the total magnification smaller ( by @xmath40 mag ) , and would further strengthen our cosmological conclusions on gray dust or evolution models .",
    "for the two early - type galaxies , # 694 and # 653 , we use the faber - jackson relation between the halo velocity dispersion and the @xmath41-band luminosity as defined by kochanek ( 1994 , 1996 ) , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 corresponds to @xmath44 mag ( efstathiou , ellis , & peterson 1988 ) and @xmath45 km s@xmath32 mpc@xmath32 ) . owing to the redshift of these galaxies , @xmath46 , we expect evolution effects to be considerable ( e.g. , treu et al . 2002 ; although see also crampton et al .",
    "keeton , kochanek , & falco ( 1998 ) studied the properties of a sample of 17 lensing galaxies with @xmath47 , and measured an evolution rate for the mass - to - light ratio of @xmath48 for the cosmological model considered here .",
    "after accounting for this effect , the velocity dispersions of galaxies # 694 and # 653 become about half of their value in the absence of evolution .",
    "because of the configuration of the lenses , placed at different redshifts , it is necessary to use the multiple lens - plane formalism ( sef ) to estimate the magnification and shear on the sn 1997ff position",
    ". the magnification matrix for @xmath49 lenses at , in general , different positions and redshifts , can be represented as    @xmath50    where @xmath51 ( the identity matrix ) , the coefficients @xmath52 are distance ratios ( @xmath53 if all the galaxies are on the sample plane ) , and @xmath54 can be represented as    @xmath55    in this equation @xmath56 and @xmath57 correspond to the convergence and shear induced by each @xmath58-galaxy on the source in the absence of other lenses . assuming that the mass distribution of the galaxies can be well represented by a singular isothermal sphere , we have    @xmath59    the einstein radius @xmath60 can be represented as @xmath61 ( bartelmann & schneider 2001 ) , where @xmath62 is the circular velocity , @xmath63 the distance between the @xmath58-galaxy and the source , and @xmath64 is the distance between the source and the observer . finally ,",
    "if the matrix @xmath65 is symmetric , it can be represented in the usual way as    @xmath66    where the total shear is @xmath67 and the total magnification is @xmath68^{-1 } $ ] .    to describe the effects of lensing on the shape of a galaxy",
    ", we can represent it with the complex ellipticity @xmath69e^{i2\\phi } $ ] , where @xmath70 is the axis ratio , @xmath71 . given",
    "a reduced shear @xmath72 , the intrinsic ellipticity of the source can be recovered as ( schneider & seitz 1995 )    @xmath73    the above equations have been implemented as a python module which can be obtained by contacting n. bentez .",
    "using the above expressions , we find that the lensing correction to the brightness of sn 1997ff is a magnification of @xmath74 mag , for an @xmath75 , @xmath76 cosmology and using the filled - beam approximation to the angular distance .",
    "table 1 shows the einstein radius and magnification @xmath77 induced on the position of sn 1997ff by each individual galaxy .",
    "if we naively multiply all these magnifications , we arrive at a value of @xmath78 , which represents only a @xmath79 difference from the multiple lens - plane formalism result .",
    "r2001 estimated that , from the ellipticity and orientation of the host galaxy , the probability of its being magnified by more than 0.34 mag by the galaxy pair # 709 and # 720 ( the two strongest lenses ) is only 18% .",
    "our new result for the total shear is @xmath80 , half of the value expected for an equivalent single isothermal sphere , and along the direction perpendicular to the # 709 + # 720 pair .",
    "given this reduced shear , the host ellipticity is significantly less constraining in providing an upper limit to the magnification ; the 90% confidence limits for the magnification are ( 0.086 , 1.37 ) .",
    "the cause of this reduced leverage of the distortion constraint is that the shear vectors from the galaxies whose contribution was not considered in r2001 partially cancel out .",
    "the result is that , unlike the magnification ( @xmath81 mag ) , the distortion they induce on the sn 1997ff host is very small , and slightly counteracts that caused by the # 709 + # 720 pair , further reducing the total shear .",
    "r2001 measured a distance modulus of @xmath82 mag , assuming @xmath83 .",
    "after correction for lensing , the new value is @xmath84 mag , in excellent agreement with the expected value of @xmath85 mag for the @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) universe expected from the @xmath88 population of sne  ia ( riess et al . 1998 ) .    using the preceding calculation to correct the sn 1997ff distance modulus for lensing , we can compare the result to toy models that invoke astrophysical sources of dimming instead of a cosmological constant to match the observations of sne  ia at @xmath88 .",
    "here we will assume the spectroscopic redshift measurement of @xmath13 for sn 1997ff to simplify the evaluation of the astrophysical dimming expected at a specific redshift .",
    "the astrophysical dimming described in r2001 would take the functional form of @xmath89 mag relative to an empty universe . at @xmath13",
    "this results in a predicted distance modulus of @xmath3146.4 mag ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the lensing - corrected distance modulus of sn 1997ff is 45.49 mag , smaller ( i.e. , the sn is brighter ) than the astrophysical dimming model by 0.91 mag ( reduced from 1.25 mag without the lensing correction ) . as discussed by r2001 , the fit to the sn data yields non - gaussian and asymmetric uncertainties beyond the @xmath91 interval . returning to the fit from r2001 to the sn data ( corrected by the slight increase in the distance modulus error due to the lensing uncertainty ) yields confidence intervals in the direction of larger distances of @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 equal to 0.34 , 0.67 , and 0.90 mag , respectively .",
    "we therefore conclude that the simplest alternatives to an accelerating universe appear to be inconsistent with sn 1997ff at the @xmath95 confidence level .",
    "however , we caution that the astrophysical model of dimming is naive and before tests of astrophysical sources can be considered robust , independent confirmation of this result will be required from additional sne  ia at @xmath96 .",
    "mannheim ( 2001 ) has shown that the observations of @xmath97 sne can be accommodated within a conformal gravity cosmological model ( mannheim 1992 ) with @xmath98 , which predicts a distance modulus of @xmath99 at @xmath100 .",
    "this agrees within @xmath101 with our new result , implying that more data are necessary to discriminate between this hypothesis and a cosmological constant .",
    "the magnification of sn 1997ff , @xmath102 , is high but compatible with the expectation from simulations .",
    "for instance , barber et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find @xmath103 for @xmath104 of the lines of sight to @xmath105 .",
    "however , we would not attribute such magnification to a selection effect ; the dispersion of observed magnitudes due to lensing is only @xmath310.2 mag , no larger than the intrinsic dispersion of sne  ia , and it has been shown to cause negligible selection bias ( riess et al . 1998 ) .    it is unlikely that lensing by large - scale structure could significantly affect our results .",
    "dalal et al .",
    "( 2002 ) show that most of the scatter in the magnification comes from scales of less than @xmath106 , corresponding to the range considered here .",
    "the expected residual root - mean - square on larger scales is @xmath107 mag , smaller than our uncertainty .",
    "it is noteworthy that by combining an `` individual lenses '' approach like the one followed here , with a shear analysis which estimates the large - scale magnification as proposed by dalal et al . , it could be possible to significantly reduce the uncertainty in supernova distances due to lensing .",
    "dark haloes ( without optically visible galaxies ) may be a possible problem with this approach , but so far there is very little , if any , evidence for their existence .",
    "the major source of error in our calculations is the dispersion in the tf and faber - jackson relations at high redshift , but in the future improved calibrations using near - infrared data should reduce this scatter considerably .",
    "the amount of magnification we expect for sn 1997ff is similar to the values determined by lewis & ibata ( 2001 ) and r2001 , and roughly agrees with the results of m \" ortsell et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for realistic values of their input parameters .",
    "however , our use of the multiple lens - plane formalism , individual galaxy k - corrections , and tf and faber - jackson relationships , corrected for evolution , provides an estimate that is more accurate and robust than previous work .    in summary ,",
    "sn 1997ff , with @xmath108 , is the highest redshift sn  ia discovered so far . it is shown here that gravitational lensing by nearby foreground galaxies is likely to have magnified sn 1997ff by @xmath109 mag . due to the spatial configuration of the foreground galaxies , the shear from the individual lenses partially cancels out , and the total distortion induced on the host galaxy is less than half of that produced by a single lens with the same magnification . after correcting for lensing , and assuming @xmath110 , the distance modulus to sn 1997ff is @xmath111 mag , in better agreement with the @xmath112 cosmology expected from lower - redshift sne  ia , but inconsistent with uniform gray dust or simple evolution models as an explanation for the dimming of @xmath97 sne  ia at the @xmath95 confidence level .",
    "it is noteworthy that our new result also agrees within @xmath101 with the predictions of conformal gravity cosmological models ( mannheim 2001 ) .    since the study of high - z sne",
    "ia can not avoid the effects of gravitational lensing , future use of sne to constrain cosmological parameters will need to consider and ultimately contend with the effects of lensing .",
