    "according to the standard scenario of the structure formation in the universe , clusters form via collisions and mergers of smaller groups and clusters .",
    "a cluster merger has a kinetic energy of the order of @xmath1 .",
    "this is the most energetic event in the universe since the big bang .",
    "if two such objects collide with each other , a huge amount of energy may be released and a certain fraction is expected to heat the gas and accelerate particles through shock waves , and induce bulk and turbulent gas motions .",
    "signatures of cluster merging can be recognized in many ways . in the x - ray band ,",
    "irregular morphology and complex temperature structure of the gas show that the system is disturbed due to past mergers . at radio wavelengths , synchrotron emission extending over a mpc scale have been discovered from more than 30 clusters @xcite .",
    "the existence of radio halo emission suggests that relativistic electrons are being accelerated in the intracluster space .",
    "interestingly , there is a correlation between the non - thermal , radio synchrotron power ( @xmath2 ) and thermal x - ray luminosity ( @xmath3 ) , for merging clusters , while relaxed clusters without a radio halo lie in a region well separated from the merging clusters on the @xmath4 plane @xcite .",
    "it is suggested that generation of high - energy particles is connected to the dynamical evolution of clusters @xcite . from the observational point of view",
    ", however , a direct link between the radio synchrotron halo and the non - thermal hard x - ray property is yet to be clarified .    in x - rays , the same population of high - energy electrons",
    "is thought to interact with 3k cmb photons and then generate non - thermal inverse - compton ( ic ) emission .",
    "the ic emission in excess of the thermal emission is then predicted to be seen in the hard x - ray band ( typically , above 10  kev ) where the thermal emission diminishes .",
    "in addition , from radio observation alone , we can not separate the energy of magnetic fields and the energy of high - energy electrons . however , by comparing the radio and hard x - ray fluxes , the cluster magnetic field is also estimated under the assumption that the same population of relativistic electrons scatters off of cmb photons @xcite .",
    "models for non - thermal bremsstrahlung emission caused by suprathermal electrons with energies of 10200  kev are presented in @xcite .    the existence of non - thermal ic hard x - ray emission has been reported in nearby clusters .",
    "the archetype is the coma cluster : the non - thermal hard x - ray flux has been measured by _",
    "rxte _ @xcite and by _ bepposax _ @xcite .",
    "recent reports based on broad - band x - ray observations with",
    "_ suzaku _ @xcite and _ swift _ @xcite did not detect any significant non - thermal component and the hard x - ray flux is reproduced by thermal models . the mismatch among several satellites is suggested to be reconciled if different sizes of fields - of - view are taken into consideration@xcite .",
    "difficulty in firm detection of non - thermal hard x - ray emission from clusters seems to indicate that the ic emission is in fact very faint and/or that its spatial distribution makes it difficult to detect using the present instruments with limited imaging capability .",
    "another issue is spectral modeling of the thermal emission component . at energies",
    "@xmath5  kev , the x - ray emission from hot clusters is still dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung emission @xcite",
    ". thus detailed characterization of the thermal emission spectrum , including the multi - temperature components , is indispensable for separating the non - thermal emission from the thermal emission . as is discovered in rx  j1347.51145 @xcite , the hard x - ray emission in the _ suzaku_/hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) band is originated predominately by the super - hot ( @xmath6  kev ) gas in the cluster .",
    "such violent mergers often produce shock - heated gas with high ( @xmath7  kev ) temperature .",
    "this needs to be properly taken into account in the thermal modeling in order to study high - energy populations in the intracluster space .",
    "we search for non - thermal hard x - ray emission from merging clusters using _ suzaku _ broad - band x - ray spectroscopy to reveal the origin of hard x - ray emission and obtain new insight into the gas physics and the cluster dynamical evolution .",
    "we also estimate the magnetic fields in clusters by comparing the hard x - ray and radio fluxes .",
    "finally , we compare the _ suzaku _ results with those from other satellites and summarize the present status of hard x - ray studies of clusters and briefly discuss the future prospects .",
    "we adopt a cosmological model with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and the hubble constant @xmath10 throughout the paper .",
    "quoted errors indicate the 90% confidence intervals , unless otherwise specified .",
    "the 5th japanese satellite , _ suzaku _",
    "@xcite , is equipped with x - ray ccd imaging spectrometers ( xis ; @xcite ) and hxd @xcite and enables sensitive broad - band x - ray observations thanks to the low and stable background levels . in particular , the pin detectors of the hxd instrument are useful for the present study because they have achieved a lower background level than other missions in the 1060  kev range @xcite . in order to constrain the hard x - ray properties of merging clusters , we conducted _ suzaku _ observations of several targets .",
    "we focus on x - ray bright sources with radio synchrotron halos , particularly a2163 at @xmath11 , and the bullet cluster at @xmath12 , since they are considered to have undergone a recent , violent merger .",
    "the _ suzaku _",
    "s exposure times are 113  ksec and 41  ksec for a2163 south and north - east regions , and 80  ksec for the bullet cluster .",
    "figure  1 shows the _ xmm - newton _ image of a2163 with overlaid the _",
    "suzaku_/hxd field of views for the two pointing observations .",
    "a2163 is the brightest abell cluster hosting one of the brightest radio halos @xcite .",
    "previous x - ray observations showed the presence of a high temperature region in the north - east , which can be attributed to the merger shock @xcite . in the hard x - ray energies , @xcite reported the detection of non - thermal ic emission with a flux level of @xmath13 in the 2080  kev band from the long _ rxte _ observations , while @xcite derived an upper limit of @xmath14 from the _ bepposax_/pds observations .",
    "thus the _ suzaku _ observation will further provide independent measurements of hard x - ray properties of the sample .",
    "the bullet cluster exhibits extended radio halo emission @xcite and a prominent strong shock feature @xcite .",
    "the hottest gas with @xmath15  kev exists in the region of the radio halo enhancement .",
    "possible detection of non - thermal hard x - ray emission has been reported ; the non - thermal flux in the 20100  kev band is @xmath16 by _",
    "rxte _ @xcite and @xmath17 by _ swift _ @xcite .",
    "thus it is worth examining the existence of ic emission with a detailed _ suzaku _ analysis .",
    "to accurately measure the non - thermal x - ray emission from clusters at hard x - ray energies ( @xmath5  kev ) , we need :    1 .   a careful assessment of the background components , 2 .   detailed modeling of the thermal emission .    for 1 . , the _ suzaku _ hxd background consists of the cosmic x - ray background and the instrumental non - x - ray background ( nxb ) , and is dominated by the latter .",
    "we estimate the systematic error of nxb to be 2% by analyzing the hxd data during the earth - occultation and quote the 2% systematic error ( @xmath18 ) in the spectral analysis of a2163 and the bullet cluster .",
    "this is consistent with suzaku - memo 2008 - 03 by the instrument team .    for 2 .",
    ", since the merging clusters can have a complex , multi - temperature structure , including a very hot thermal gas that emits hard x - rays , we apply single- , two- , and multi - temperature thermal models to the _ suzaku _ spectra . as detailed later , the multi - temperature model is constructed based on the analysis of _ xmm - newton _ or _ chandra _ data .",
    "the _ suzaku _ and _ xmm - newton_/_chandra _ joint analysis allows us to take advantage of _ suzaku _ s spectral sensitivity in the wide x - ray band and the _ xmm - newton_/ _ chandra _ s high spatial resolution , as demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "with _ suzaku_/hxd , we detected x - ray emission from the cluster up to 50  kev . with the cxb and nxb components subtracted",
    ", the 1260  kev source flux is measured to be @xmath19 . here",
    "the first and second errors indicate the 1-@xmath20 statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the 1-@xmath20 systematic error of the flux is estimated by changing the normalization of the nxb model by @xmath21% .",
    "thus the detection of hard x - ray emission is significant at the @xmath22 level even if the systematic error of nxb is considered .",
    "next we performed the joint _ xmm_+_suzaku_/hxd spectral analyses under i ) the single - temperature model , ii ) the two - temperature model , and iii ) the multi - temperature ( multi - t ) model . for i ) and ii ) , the _ xmm - newton _ pn and mos spectra were accumulated from the @xmath23 circular region , as shown in figure  1 .    for i )",
    ", the _ xmm_+_suzaku _ broad - band spectra in the 0.360  kev band can be fitted by the apec thermal emission model : the resultant gas temperature and the metal abundance are @xmath24  kev and @xmath25  solar , respectively , and @xmath26/d.o.f . is 1249/1180 .",
    "thus the hard x - ray emission is likely to be dominated by the thermal emission . for ii ) , we have not found any significant improvement of the fits in comparison to case i ) .",
    "however , there is obviously a complex temperature structure as shown by the previous x - ray observations , and we attempted to construct the multi - t model for the thermal emission below .",
    "\\iii ) the @xmath27 spectral region of the _ xmm _ data is divided into @xmath28 grids and the single - component apec model is assumed for each grid .",
    "figure  2 shows the total model of multi - t components ( namely the sum of the single apec models for the grids ) fit to the _ suzaku_/hxd data .",
    "we find that this multi - t model gives an acceptable fit to the hxd spectrum .",
    "note that the model includes a @xmath29  kev apec component for the north - east `` shock '' region , which is in agreement with the previous _ xmm _ result @xcite .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of this hot component is @xmath30 , which contributes to the hard x - ray emission by about 15% .    in the case of iii ) , the additional power - law component for non - thermal ic emission does not significantly improve the fit to the observed hxd spectrum . assuming the multi - t+ power - law model with @xmath31 ( i.e. , the same index in radio @xcite ) , the 90% upper limit on the non - thermal emission is derived as @xmath32",
    "this gives 3-times stronger constraints than the upper limit obtained from _",
    "rxte _ @xcite , though the present result is consistent with _",
    "rxte _ and _ bepposax _ @xcite within their errors .",
    "more details of data reduction and discussions are to be described in a forthcoming paper ( n. ota et al . in preparation ) .",
    "following similar methods mentioned in  [ subsec : a2163 ] , we analyzed the _",
    "suzaku _ and _ chandra _ data of the bullet cluster .",
    "our preliminary analysis showed that the global cluster spectrum taken with _",
    "suzaku _ is well represented by a two - component thermal model .",
    "however , the non - thermal emission is not significantly detected , yielding the 90% upper limit on a @xmath33 power - law component to be @xmath34 ( 20100  kev ) .",
    "note that the derived upper limit depends on the assumed photon index .",
    "the observed broad - band _ suzaku _ spectrum in the 150  kev band can also be fitted by the multi - t model . here",
    "the multi - t model is constructed by analyzing the deep _ chandra _ observations .",
    "we did not confirm the previous ic detections with _",
    "rxte _ and _ swift _ , and the present results support the thermal origin of the hard x - ray emission . under the multi - t model",
    ", the flux of the hot ( @xmath35  kev ) thermal component is estimated to be @xmath36 and comparable to the non - thermal flux reported by @xcite , while the ic flux is suggested to be even lower than @xmath37 .",
    "more details of the analysis , including an assessment of systematic uncertainty due to the _ suzaku_-_chandra _ cross - calibration , will be presented in nagayoshi et al . in preparation",
    "for the two hot clusters , a2163 and bullet , the hard x - ray spectra taken with _",
    "suzaku _ are likely to be dominated by thermal emission , giving stronger limits on the non - thermal ic emission .",
    "we also note that a super - hot ( @xmath38  kev ) gas exists in both clusters whose contribution is not negligible in the hard x - ray band .",
    "thus this component should be properly modeled in order to accurately measure the non - thermal component .",
    "furthermore , this hot gas is over - pressured and thus thought to be short - lived , @xmath39  gyr @xcite . therefore the existence of super - hot gas supports the scenario of a recent merger .",
    "given the link between the radio flux and x - ray luminosity ( see  [ sec : intro ] ) , the generation of high - energy particles in intracluster space is likely to be connected with the merging events .",
    "thus , _ is there any relationship between @xmath3 and ic flux ( @xmath40 ) or between the gas temperature ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath40 ? _    with _ suzaku _ , non - thermal hard x - ray emission has been constrained in about ten clusters . in figure  3",
    ", @xmath40 is plotted as a function of @xmath41 .",
    "the _ suzaku _",
    "results for nearby clusters as well as rx  j1347.51145 were taken from the literature @xcite .",
    "the _ rxte_/_bepposax_/_swift _",
    "results @xcite are also quoted for comparison .",
    "note that the non - thermal flux depends on the modeling of the thermal component as well as the assumption of the photon index for the non - thermal component . for _ suzaku",
    "_ , non - thermal emission has not been detected and the upper limit was derived for the nearby objects including the coma cluster , a2319 etc .",
    "hence there is no clear relation on the @xmath42 plane .      using the observed radio flux , @xmath43 , and the relation @xmath44 @xcite",
    ", we can infer the strength of the cluster magnetic field .",
    "in the case of a2163 , adopting the radio flux @xmath45  mjy at 1.4  ghz @xcite and the ic upper limit of @xmath46 at 12  kev from the this work , we obtain @xmath47 for the multi - t + power - law ( @xmath31 ) model . for the bullet cluster , the magnetic field",
    "is estimated to be @xmath48 under the two - temperature apec + power - law ( @xmath33 ) model .",
    "thus a lower limit of the order of @xmath49 has been obtained in most of the clusters observed with _",
    "_ suzaku _ broad - band x - ray observations of hot clusters hosting a bright radio synchrotron halo , a2163 and the bullet cluster , were performed in order to search for the non - thermal hard x - ray component and reveal the origin of the high - energy emission and the cluster dynamical evolution .",
    "the _ suzaku_/hxd spectra for these two clusters are well represented by single- or two - temperature thermal models .",
    "since the merging clusters can often have shock - heated , super - hot ( @xmath50  kev ) gas , and its contribution is not negligible in the interpretation of the hard x - ray origin , it is essential to determine the thermal component with high accuracy .",
    "this motivated us to carry out the joint _ suzaku_+_xmm - newton_/_chandra _ spectral analysis under the multi - t model . as a result , the observed _ suzaku _ spectra are consistent with the multi - t models and we did not find any significant non - thermal ic emission from a2163 and the bullet cluster .",
    "the properties of hard x - rays and the cluster magnetic fields have been studied for about ten clusters so far .",
    "there is no significant detection of ic emission by _ suzaku _ , giving the upper limits on the level of @xmath51 .",
    "thus no clear relationship between the non - thermal x - ray and radio properties or the ic luminosity ( @xmath52)@xmath53 is seen . to further constrain the physics of gas heating and particle acceleration in clusters , it is important to increase the number of cluster samples by applying the present analysis method to other clusters .    given that the relativistic particles are localized in small , shock regions , present instruments with limited imaging capability may fail to identify their existence .",
    "if this is the case , the advent of hard x - ray imagers will benefit the cluster study . now _ nustar _",
    "@xcite is successfully in orbit and taking focused images of the high - energy x - ray sky .",
    "the _ astro - h _ satellite is scheduled to be launched in 2014 @xcite , and will carry state - of - the - art instruments to realize sensitive x - ray observations in the 0.3600  kev band .",
    "the hard x - ray imagers on _ astro - h _ will have an effective area comparable to _ nustar_. these new hard x - ray imagers will enable a more accurate high - temperature thermal component and identification of the particle acceleration site to get higher signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "this will lead us to detect the ic emission to a level @xmath54 orders of magnitudes lower than the present limit .",
    "in addition , the high - spectral resolution of x - ray micro - calorimeters will enable direct measurements of bulk / turbulent gas motions@xcite .",
    "_ astro - h _ can therefore measure non - thermal energies in the form of kinetic gas motions ( turbulence , bulk gas motion ) and relativistic particles , leading us to draw a more comprehensive picture of the cluster structure and evolution .",
