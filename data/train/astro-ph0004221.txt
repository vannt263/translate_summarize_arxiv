    "it has been known that nearby elliptical galaxies have color gradients ; colors in an elliptical galaxy gradually become bluer with increasing radius ( e.g. , vader et al .",
    "1988 ; franx , illingworth , & heckman 1989 ; peletier et al . 1990a ; peletier , valentijn , & jameson 1990b , goudfrooij et al . 1994 ; michard 1999 ) .",
    "since many of elliptical galaxies show radial gradients in metal absorption line strengths such as mg@xmath2 , fe@xmath3(5270  ) and fe@xmath2(5335  ) ( e.g. , carollo , danziger , & buson 1993 ; davies , sadler , & peletier 1993 ; gonzalez 1993 ; kobayashi & arimoto 1999 ) , the origin of the color gradients has been naively interpreted to be the metallicity gradients .    however , such an interpretation for the origin of the color gradient is premature , because both metallicity gradient and age gradient in stellar population can cause the same color gradient , and we can not distinguish the cause for the gradient .",
    "this is called _ age - metallicity degeneracy _ , which was originally pointed out by worthey , trager , & faber ( 1996 ) in terms of the origin of the color - magnitude relation of nearby elliptical galaxies ( see also arimoto 1996 ) . in order to break this degeneracy and to know the primary origin of the color gradients in elliptical galaxies ,",
    "comparing the observed color gradients in distant ellipticals with predicted model gradients caused by either the metallicity gradient or the age gradient is a very effective approach , as was successful for examining the origin of the color - magnitude ( cm ) relation ( kodama & arimoto , 1997 ) .",
    "tamura et al . ( 2000 ; hereafter called paper i ) constructed the two models both of which reproduce a typical color gradient of elliptical galaxies at @xmath4 using a population synthesis model .",
    "in one model , the mean metallicity of the stellar population decreases with increasing radius at a fixed old mean age . while in the other one , the mean age decreases with a radius at a fixed mean metallicity . these models",
    "were then made evolve back in time .",
    "the evolution of color gradients thus predicted are confronted with the observed ones in distant ( @xmath5 ) ellipticals sampled from the _ hubble deep field - north _",
    "( hdf - n ; williams et al . 1996 ) .",
    "as a result , paper i found that the metallicity gradient is the primary origin of color gradients and the age gradient model can not reproduce the observed gradient at such redshift .",
    "the elliptical galaxies in the hdf - n , however , are only those in field environment .",
    "it has never been obvious that ellipticals in clusters evolve similarly as those in field . in rich clusters",
    ", it has been found that the color - magnitude relation still holds even at around @xmath6 ( e.g. , stanford , eisenhardt , & dickinson 1998 ) and these observational results seem to favor the classical monolithic collapse scenario associated with the galactic wind and high-@xmath7 formation ( e.g. , @xmath8 ) of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , kodama et al .",
    "however , this kind of evolution has not been established for ellipticals in lower density environment ( but see kodama , bower , & bell 1998 ) .",
    "some predictions either theoretically or observationally show that field ellipticals formed by recent ( at @xmath9 ) merging processes ( e.g. , baugh , cole , & frenk 1996 ; barger et al .",
    "an internal structure of a galaxy such as a metallicity gradient and an age gradient must depend on its formation process .",
    "if cluster ellipticals pass different formation histories from those for field ellipticals , their internal structures , thus the origin of the color gradients , may not be the same . or some environmental effects on color gradients may exist .",
    "thus , the same approach is needed for cluster ellipticals to clarify the origin of their color gradients .",
    "it is noted that dust extinction in elliptical galaxies may also have some effects on the color gradients ( goudfrooij & de jong 1995 ; wise & silva 1996 ; silva & wise 1996 ) .",
    "however , about half of the detection towards ellipticals in far infrared with iras are around @xmath10 threshold and confirmation is needed to be definitive ( bregman et al . 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , spatial distribution of dust in an elliptical galaxy as well as dust mass which could affect a color gradient are not established yet .",
    "these are still open problems and will be examined in detail in our forthcoming papers .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we have chosen to focus on age and metallicity effects only .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the sample selection and data analysis of elliptical galaxies are described in   2 .",
    "histograms of color gradients are presented in   3 together with the representative color profiles of the sample ellipticals .",
    "discussion is given in ",
    "the cosmological parameters adopted throughout this paper are the same as those in paper i ; @xmath11 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "in order to examine color gradients in elliptical galaxies in distant clusters , deep imaging data with a high angular resolution are necessary in more than two bands .",
    "thus , we choose to use the archival data taken with the wfpc2 on - board the hst .",
    "smail et al .",
    "( 1997 ) obtained deep imaging data of 11 distant rich clusters at the redshift from 0.37 to 0.56 , most of which have exposure times more than 10,000 sec to examine their morphology in detail , and presented catalogs of the detected objects . in this paper ,",
    "their reduced imaging data which are available at their web site are used . from these data ,",
    "we select six clusters whose images were taken in two bands to obtain galaxy colors .",
    "cluster ids and their basic properties taken from smail et al .",
    "( 1997 ) are given in table 1 . among these clusters ,",
    "cl 0024@xmath1516 , cl 0016@xmath1516 , and cl 0054@xmath1627 are classified as high concentration clusters and cl 0939@xmath1547 and cl 0412@xmath1665 are low concentration clusters ( dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) . for a370 and cl 0939@xmath1547 , the images of their outer fields were taken .",
    "therefore , environmental effects on color gradients may be examined .",
    "early type galaxies ( e , e / s0 , s0/e ) in these clusters are sampled based on the catalog by smail et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . since our main interest is to examine their color gradients , high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) is required and thus galaxies brighter than the apparent magnitude of 21 mag in @xmath17 band are selected in all of the sample clusters .",
    "this apparent magnitude roughly corresponds to the absolute magnitude of @xmath18 mag in @xmath19 band .",
    "our sample galaxies are listed in table 2 with their basic parameters , most of which are taken from smail et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . in each cluster",
    ", the sample galaxies form the tight cm relations as shown in figure 1 , though the relations in a370 , cl 0939@xmath1547 , and cl 0412@xmath1665 are somewhat loose .",
    "since cl 0939@xmath1547 and cl 0412@xmath1665 are classified as low concentration clusters , and the outer regions of the clusters were imaged for a370 and cl 0939@xmath1547 , some environmental effects on the cm relations might be seen . however , a discussion for this subject is beyond our scope in this paper . in the figure ,",
    "a solid square with an open circle shows the object removed from the following analysis , because their color gradients could not be derived accurately enough to use our discussion due to their low signal - to - noise ratios ( s / ns ) or due to their close positions to an edge of the image .",
    "in deriving color profiles of the sample galaxies , we should take care of a positional coincidence between a blue image and a red image , and a difference of the sizes of point spread functions ( psfs ) between the two images .",
    "( one pixel corresponds to @xmath20 for the wide field cameras and @xmath21 for the planetary camera . )",
    "positional displacement between a blue image and a red one causes spurious asymmetry of a color distribution in a galaxy and has a serious effect on the color gradient .",
    "we examined the centroids of the sample galaxies in both blue and red images and corrected a displacement , if a systematic shift between the two images in each cluster was found .",
    "the sizes of psfs should be also estimated and be adjusted between blue and red images .",
    "we simulated the psf at each position of a sample galaxy in each band by using tinytim v4.4 ( krist 1995 ; krist & hook 1997 ) , and corrected the difference of the sizes between the two images , which were estimated by fitting a gaussian to the psfs .",
    "sky value was determined by `` mode '' in an annulus with an inner radius of @xmath22 and a width of 3@xmath23 by using the `` phot '' task in the iraf apphot package and the obtained sky was subtracted .",
    "we next made azimuthally averaged radial surface brightness profiles in both blue and red images with a radial sampling of 0.@xmath231 .",
    "these profiles in each galaxy are made along the ellipses fitted with a fixed position angle to the isophotes of the galaxy images in the red band .",
    "( the position angles are taken from table 2a by smail et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . )",
    "thus the surface brightness profiles in the two bands are derived based on the same fitted elliptical isophotes . in figure 2 ,",
    "representative surface brightness profiles of our sample galaxies are shown .",
    "the profiles of the brightest , intermediate , and the faintest sample galaxies in each cluster are shown in top , middle , and bottom panels , respectively .",
    "the profiles of almost all the galaxies in our sample are well represented by the @xmath24 law .",
    "to derive color profiles , the surface brightness profile in the red band is subtracted from the profile in the blue band .",
    "figure 3 shows the resulting color profiles with the same arrangement as in figure 2 .",
    "an error bar to each data point includes a photometric error , a local sky subtraction error ( 1@xmath25 of a sky value around each object is adopted ) , and a dispersion of colors along each elliptical isophote .",
    "it is important to describe here the two dimensional color distribution in the sample galaxies .",
    "the color maps were constructed by dividing the blue image by the red image after adjusting the positional displacement and difference of the sizes of the psfs .",
    "almost all the color maps show smooth color distribution and do not show any asymmetric or peculiar features .",
    "thus the color profiles well represent the color distribution in each galaxy .",
    "finally , slopes of the color profiles , i.e. , color gradients , in the sample galaxies are derived by the least square fitting within effective radii , which are obtained from the surface brightness profiles in the red band assuming the @xmath24 law .",
    "the fitting for the color gradients are done after removing data points with errors larger than 0.3 mag .",
    "we do not derive the gradients of the profiles with accepted data points fewer than 3 .",
    "the average number of the data points used for the fitting is about 8 and the rejected objects are minor .",
    "resulting color gradients in the sample galaxies are listed in table 2 with the 1@xmath26 fitting errors .",
    "figure 3 indicates resulting slopes of the color gradients as well as the slopes with @xmath27 . in this figure",
    ", abscissa refers to logarithm of a radius normalized by the outermost radius ( @xmath28 ) used for the fitting in each color profile . for most of the sample galaxies , @xmath28 is roughly equal to @xmath29 .",
    "figure 4 shows a histogram for the color gradients of the sample galaxies in each cluster .",
    "each bin of the histograms is set to be 0.2 mag / dex which is comparable to the average value of the fitting error .",
    "it is found that the distributions of the gradients are very narrow except for a few outliers , which are # 535 and # 738 in cl 0024@xmath1516 , # 2005 in cl 0939@xmath1547 , and # 2050 in cl 0016@xmath1516 .",
    "the former three are significantly out of the cm relation towards the blue side , but the last one is almost on the relation . considering that the range of the distribution of the color gradients is comparable with or only slightly larger than the estimated error for the slopes , the intrinsic dispersions of the color gradients must be considerably small .",
    "( the dispersion of the color gradients in nearby elliptical galaxies is about 0.04 mag / dex ( peletier et al . 1990a ; paper i ) . )",
    "it is intriguing that the color gradients of elliptical galaxies are uniform even at intermediate redshift .",
    "furthermore , this encourages the comparison between model gradients and observed gradients in distant clusters , despite rather large errors for the observed slopes .",
    "in order to examine whether the origin of the color gradient is the stellar metallicity or the age , we adopt the same approach as that in paper i and the reader should refer to it in detail .",
    "we briefly summarize it here .",
    "an observed color gradient can be reproduced by either a metallicity gradient or an age gradient of stellar populations in an elliptical galaxy at @xmath4 . however , since the color gradient caused by a metallicity gradient is expected to follow a different evolution from that by an age gradient , the origin of the color gradients can be found by comparing the observed ones at high redshift with those predicted by model .",
    "for this purpose , using the population synthesis model ( kodama & arimoto 1997 ; kobayashi , tsujimoto , & nomoto 2000 ) , we construct the two model galaxies ; one model galaxy has the color gradient made by the pure metallicity gradient ( thereafter called _ metallicity gradient model _ ) without age gradient , and the other made by the pure age gradient ( _ age gradient model _ ) without metallicity gradient . in the metallicity gradient model ,",
    "the metallicity gradient is produced by assuming that a galactic wind blowed later in the inner region in an elliptical galaxy ; star formation continued longer and thus the mean stellar metallicity became higher at the inner region . for the age gradient model ,",
    "star formation started earlier in the inner region and thus the mean age of stellar populations is older than that in the outer region .",
    "the stellar population in each region in an elliptical galaxy is assumed to be made by a single burst and to evolve independently of other regions .",
    "model parameters used here are set to the same as those in paper i , which are chosen so as to reproduce the typical color gradient at @xmath4 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath30 of @xmath31 mag@xmath32dex obtained by peletier et al .",
    "( 1990a ) is adopted as the typical color gradient at @xmath4 .",
    "note that these model galaxies must be old ( 8 @xmath1 15 gyr ) to reproduce colors in nearby elliptical galaxies .",
    "then , we calculate the spectral evolution in each region of the model galaxies and their color gradients at any redshifts using the response functions including each filter on the hst . it should be emphasized that we do not intend to study physical formation process of elliptical galaxies in this paper , but aim at depicting the evolution of the color gradient caused by either metallicity gradient or age gradient to be compared with the observed ones .",
    "actual physical process that made the metallicity / age gradient may be different from our brief ideas presented in the model description .",
    "however it is not a problem here , because once such gradient formed , subsequent evolution of the stellar population is unique and does not depend on the formation process .",
    "the two lines in each panel of figure 5 show the evolutionary track of the model color gradients ; the solid curve indicates the evolution for the metallicity gradient model and the dotted curve for the age gradient model .",
    "the model color gradient by the metallicity gradient is almost constant with a redshift within @xmath6 , while that by the age gradient changes abruptly and shows a quite steep gradient even at @xmath33 .",
    "we will compare the model gradients with the observed ones in the next subsection .",
    "the mean values of the color gradients in each cluster sample are plotted at their redshifts in figure 5 .",
    "an error bar attached to each point indicates a mean error of the gradients in each cluster .",
    "as clearly shown , the metallicity gradient is much more favorable as the origin of the color gradients .",
    "this result does not depend on cosmological parameters or parameters for an evolutionary model of galaxy within a reasonable range , and does not change even if we consider the dispersion of the color gradients in the sample galaxies ( see figure 4 ) and that in nearby ellipticals ( @xmath34 mag / dex ) . although the sample galaxies of which memberships in the clusters are spectroscopically confirmed are minor ( dressler et al . 1999 ) , background or foreground contaminations are not expected to affect the result for the origin of the color gradients , because the result does not change even if we remove the galaxies which significantly deviate from the cm relation in each cluster .",
    "the color gradients in several sample galaxies may be affected by other galaxies close to them , and the color profile of a galaxy which locates close to an edge of the chip or on a joint between the cameras may be somewhat spurious .",
    "however , our result still holds even after removing the galaxies which may suffer from these effects .    considering the result in paper i , in both cluster and field , the primary origin of the color gradients in elliptical galaxies",
    "is considered to be the stellar metallicity .",
    "however , it is interesting to point out that the mean values of the color gradients seem to deviate upwards from the line for the metallicity gradient model .",
    "our models are calibrated by the color gradients seen in nearby ellipticals by peletier et al .",
    "( 1990a ) , in which most of the sample ellipticals reside in field or group environment .",
    "therefore , the upward deviation might indicate an environmental effect on the color gradients of elliptical galaxies between in rich clusters and in field .",
    "however , the correlation between the mean value and the degree of the concentration in each cluster is not seen .",
    "in addition , the mean gradients of the clusters of which outer field images were taken do not show larger values than others .",
    "further detailed study on the color gradients in cluster ellipticals and field ones at @xmath4 as well as at high redshift should be done in the future .",
