    "since long time the topic of study of the in - medium properties of hadrons has drawn considerable interest of particle physicst because of its importance in understanding the strong interaction physics and having relevance in heavy - ion collision experiments as well as in nuclear astrophysics .",
    "there have been extensive experimental efforts to study the in - medium properties of hadrons through experimental observables like production and propagation of the hadrons in hot and dense hadronic medium .",
    "the observed enhanced dilepton spectra @xcite could be a signature of in medium vector meson mass reduction @xcite and for the formation of thermalized quark gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "the production of photons @xcite arising from the heavy ion collision experiments is a promising observable which probes matter resulting from the high energy nuclear collisions .",
    "the hard photons production is a promising source that can provide information about the thermodynamical state of the plasma produced in heavy ion collision experiments @xcite .",
    "similarly kaons and antikaons properties have been studied experimentally by kaos collaboration and the production of kaons and antikaons in the heavy - ion collisions and their collective flow are directly related to the medium modification of their spectral functions @xcite . at the compressed baryonic matter ( cbm )",
    "experiment at the future facility at gsi , one expects to produce matter at high densities @xcite and the in - medium properties of strange and charm mesons are some of the important topics planned to be investigated extensively .",
    "therefore , the topic of the study of charm mesons in dense hadronic matter has also gotten considerable interest in the recent past .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons are modified due to interaction of the light quark ( u , d ) or antiquark present in them with the nuclear medium .",
    "the experimental signatures for the mass modifications of @xmath0 and @xmath11 mesons can be their production ratio as well as @xmath10 suppression in the hadronic medium @xcite . in heavy - ion collision experiments of much higher energies , e.g. , in rhic or lhc",
    ", it is suggested that the @xmath10 suppression is because of the formation of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "however , in ref . @xcite it is observed that the effect of hadron absorption of @xmath10 is not negligible .",
    "the @xmath10 suppression can also be due to comover interaction as suggested in ref .",
    "an important difference between @xmath10 suppression pattern in comovers interaction model and in a deconfining scenario is that in the former case the anomalous suppression sets in smoothly from peripheral to central collisions rather than in a sudden way when the deconfining threshold is reached @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was reported that the charmonium suppression observed in pb + pb collisions of na50 experiment can not be explained by nucleon absorption only , but need some additional density dependent suppression mechanism .",
    "it was suggested in these studies that the comover scattering can explain the additional suppression of charmonium .",
    "the @xmath10 suppression in nuclear collision at sps energies has been studied in covariant transport approach hsd in ref .",
    "the calculations show that the absorption of @xmath10 s by both nucleons and produced mesons can explain reasonably not only the total @xmath10 cross section but also the transverse energy dependence of @xmath10 suppression measured in both proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions . due to the reduction in the masses of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons in the medium",
    "it is a possibility that excited charmonium states can decay to @xmath12 pairs @xcite instead of decaying to lowest charmonium state @xmath10 .",
    "actually higher charmonium states are considered as the major source of @xmath10 @xcite . even at certain higher densities",
    "it can become a possibility that @xmath10 itself will decay to @xmath12 pairs .",
    "so this can be an explanation of the observed @xmath10 suppression by na50 collaboration at @xmath13 gev / nucleon in the pb - pb collisions @xcite .",
    "the excited states of charmonium also undergo mass drop in the nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "the modifications of the in - medium masses of @xmath0 mesons is larger than the @xmath10 mass modification @xcite .",
    "this is because @xmath10 is made of heavy quarks and these interact with the nuclear medium through gluon condensates .",
    "the change in gluon condensates with the nuclear density is very small and hence leads to only a small modification of the @xmath10 mass .",
    "the in - medium modifications of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons have been studied in the literature using qcd sum rule approach , quark meson coupling ( qmc ) model and coupled channel approach . in the qcd sum rule approach , it is suggested that the light quark or antiquark of @xmath0 mesons interact with the light quark condensate leading to the medium modification of @xmath14 meson masses @xcite . in the qmc model",
    "the scalar @xmath2 meson couples to the confined light quark ( u , d ) in the nucleon thus giving a drop of the nucleon mass in the medium .",
    "the d -meson properties within the qmc model have been studied in ref .",
    "the drop in the mass of @xmath0 mesons arises due to the interaction with the nuclear medium and the mass drop of the @xmath0 mesons observed in the qmc model turns out to be similar to that calculated in the qcd sum rule approach .",
    "charmed baryonic resonances have recieved a lot of attentions due to discovery of quite a few new states by celo , belle , and babar collaborations @xcite .",
    "whether these resonance states have @xmath15 structure or generated dynamcially via meson baryon scattering processes is a matter of great interest @xcite .",
    "the study of the properties of @xmath0 mesons in the coupled channel approach using separable potential leads to the generation of resonance @xmath16 in i = 0 channel @xcite analogous to @xmath17 in the coupled channel approach for the @xmath18 interaction @xcite .",
    "the study of the spectral density of @xmath0 mesons at finite temperatures and densities , considering modifications of the nucleons in the medium , indicate a dominant increase in the width of the @xmath0-meson whereas there is a very small change in the @xmath0-meson mass in the medium @xcite . however , these calculations @xcite , assume the interaction to be su(3 ) symmetric in u , d , c quarks and ignore channels with charmed hadrons with strangeness .",
    "a coupled channel approach for the study of d - mesons has been developed based on su(4 ) symmetry @xcite to construct the effective interaction between pseudoscalar mesons in a 16-plet with baryons in 20-plet representation through exchange of vector mesons and with ksfr condition @xcite .",
    "this model @xcite has been modified in aspects like regularization method and has been used to study dn interactions in ref .",
    "this reproduces the resonance @xmath19 in the i=0 channel and in addition generates another resonance in the i=1 channel at around 2770 mev .",
    "these calculations have been generalized to finite temperatures @xcite accounting for the in - medium modifications of the nucleons in a walecka type @xmath20 model , to study the @xmath0 and @xmath11 properties @xcite in the hot and dense hadronic matter . at the nuclear matter density and for zero temperature , these resonances ( @xmath19 and @xmath21 ) are generated @xmath22 mev and @xmath23 mev below their free space positions .",
    "however at finite temperature , e.g. , at @xmath24 mev resonance positions shift to @xmath25 mev and @xmath26 mev for @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) respectively .",
    "thus at finite temperature resonances are seen to move closer to their free space values .",
    "this is because of the reduction of pauli blocking factor arising due to the fact that fermi surface is smeared out with temperature .",
    "for @xmath1 mesons in coupled channel approach a small repulsive mass shift is obtained .",
    "this will rule out of any possibility of charmed mesic nuclei @xcite suggested in the qmc model @xcite .",
    "but as we shall see in our investigation , we obtain a small attractive mass shift for @xmath1 mesons which can give rise to the possibility of the formation of charmed mesic nuclei . using heavy quark symmetry , the @xmath31-nucleus bound states",
    "have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite using @xmath0 meson selfenergy calculated in the nuclear medium @xcite . in heavy quark symmetry ,",
    "the pseudoscalar @xmath0 meson and the vector meson , @xmath32 are treated on equal footing and this leads to the generation of a broad spectrum of new resonant meson - baryon states in the charm one and strangeness zero @xcite and the exotic charm minus one @xcite sectors .",
    "the inclusion of vector mesons is the keystone for obtaining an attractive d - nucleus interaction that leads to the existence of @xmath31 nucleus bound states , as compared previous studies based on su(4 ) flavor symmetry @xcite .",
    "the study of @xmath0 meson self - energy in the nuclear matter is also helpful in understanding the properties of the charm and the hidden charm resonances in the nuclear matter @xcite . in coupled channel approach the charmed resonance @xmath33 mainly couples to @xmath34 system , while the @xmath35 couples to @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the hidden charm resonance couples mostly to @xmath12 .",
    "therefore any modification of @xmath0 meson properties in the nuclear medium will affect the properties of these resonances .    in the present investigation we study the in - medium modifications of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons in isospin asymmetric strange hadronic matter .",
    "the medium modifications of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons are due to their interactions with the nucleons , the scalar isoscalar meson @xmath2 and the scalar isovector meson @xmath3 , which are modified in the hyperonic matter .",
    "the medium modifications of the light hadrons ( nucleons and scalar mesons ) are described by using a chiral @xmath38 model @xcite .",
    "the model has been used to study finite nuclei , the nuclear matter properties , the in - medium properties of the vector mesons @xcite as well as to investigate the optical potentials of kaons and antikaons in nuclear matter @xcite and in hyperonic matter in @xcite . for the study of the properties of @xmath0 mesons in isospin - asymmetric strange hadronic matter ,",
    "the chiral su(3 ) model is generalized to @xmath39 flavor symmetry to obtain the interactions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons with the light hadrons .",
    "since the chiral symmetry is explicitly broken for the su(4 ) case due to the large charm quark mass , we use the su(4 ) symmetry here only to obtain the interactions of the @xmath0 and @xmath11 mesons with the light hadron sector , but use the observed values of the heavy hadron masses and empirical values of the decay constants .",
    "this has been in line with the philosophy followed in ref .",
    "@xcite where charmonium absorption in nuclear matter was studied using the su(4 ) model to obtain the relevant interactions .",
    "however , the values of the heavy hadron masses and the coupling constants in ref .",
    "@xcite , were taken as the empirical values or as calculated from other theoretical models .",
    "the coupling constants were derived by using the relations from su(4 ) symmetry , if neither the empirical values nor values calculated from other theoretical models were available @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 meson properties in symmetric hot nuclear matter using the su(4 ) model have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and for the case of asymmetric nuclear matter at zero temperature @xcite and at finite temperature in ref .",
    "the charmonium mass in hot asymmetric nuclear matter hass been studied within present chiral model in ref .",
    "the mass modifications of charmonium states arise due to the interaction with the gluon condensates of qcd , simulated through the scalar dilaton field introduced to incorporate the broken scale invariance of qcd within effective chiral model ref .",
    "@xcite .    within the su(4 ) model considered in the present investigation ,",
    "the @xmath40 energies are modified due to a vectorial weinberg - tomozawa , scalar exchange terms as well as range terms @xcite .",
    "the isospin asymmetric effects among @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the doublet , d@xmath41 as well as between @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the doublet , @xmath42 arise due to the scalar - isovector @xmath3 meson , due to asymmetric contributions in the weinberg - tomozawa term , as well as in the range term @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section ii , we give a brief introduction to the effective chiral @xmath38 model used to study the isospin asymmetric strange hadronic matter , and its extension to the @xmath39 model to derive the interactions of the charmed mesons with the light hadrons . in section iii",
    ", we present the dispersion relations for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons which are solved to obtain their optical potentials in the dense strange hyperonic matter .",
    "the effects of isospin asymmetry , strangeness fraction of the hadronic medium on the optical potentials of the @xmath0 and @xmath11 mesons are investigated .",
    "section iv contains the results obtained for the medium modifications of the @xmath0 and @xmath11 mesons in the hyperonic matter and finally , in section v , we summarize the findings of the present investigation and discuss possible outlook .",
    "we use a chiral @xmath38 model for the study of the light hadrons in the present investigation @xcite .",
    "the model is based on nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry @xcite and broken scale invariance @xcite .",
    "the effective hadronic chiral lagrangian contains the following terms @xmath44 in eq.([genlag ] ) , @xmath45 is the kinetic energy term , @xmath46 is the baryon - meson interaction term in which the baryons - spin-0 meson interaction term generates the baryon masses .",

    "a small deviation of the mixing angle from ideal mixing @xcite has not been taken into account in the present investigation .",
    "the concept of broken scale invariance leading to the trace anomaly in ( massless ) qcd , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the gluon field strength tensor of qcd , can be mimicked in an effective lagrangian at tree level @xcite through the introduction of the scale breaking potential ( last two terms of eq .",

    "the observed attractive mass shifts for the @xmath0 mesons is also supported by the recent calculations in coupled channel approach based on heavy quark symmetry @xcite , which can give rise to the possibility of the @xmath0-mesic nuclei .    the ratios @xmath246 and @xmath247 could be promising observables to study the effect of strangeness fraction of the medium on the properties of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons . the isospin dependence of @xmath112 and @xmath31 masses is seen to be a dominant medium effect at high densities , which might show in their production ( @xmath246 ) ,",
    "whereas , for the @xmath127 and @xmath126 , one sees that , even though these have a strong density dependence , their in - medium masses remain similar at a given value for the isospin - asymmetry parameter @xmath76 . the strong density , strangeness and isospin dependence of the @xmath130 meson optical potentials in asymmetric strange hadronic matter can be tested in the asymmetric heavy - ion collision experiments at future gsi facility @xcite .",
    "the study of the in - medium modifications of @xmath0 mesons in strange hadronic matter at finite temperatures within the @xmath39 model will be a possible extension of the present investigation .",
    "the medium modifications of the charmonium states as well as strange charmed mesons in the strange hadronic matter are also planned to be investigated .",
