    "this paper is concerned with a closely related version of the death - birth updating process in evolutionary game theory introduced in  @xcite .",
    "this model is an example of a spatial evolutionary game designed based on the framework of interacting particle systems .",
    "the concept of evolutionary game theory is an extension of traditional game theory that has been proposed by  @xcite to describe the dynamics of populations in which fitness is frequency dependent : individuals are viewed as players who are characterized by their strategy and receive a certain payoff through their interactions with other individuals .",
    "the payoff is then interpreted as fitness so that players with a larger payoff have a higher reproductive success .",
    "one of the most popular models of evolutionary game is the replicator equation  @xcite which assumes that the population is well - mixing .",
    "in contrast , the death - birth updating process includes a spatial structure in the form of local interactions : players are located on the set of vertices of a connected graph and interact with a finite set of neighbors , meaning that they update their strategy based on these neighbors .",
    "see  @xcite for a general definition and a brief review of such models .",
    "the model in  @xcite assumes that the updates are neutral with high probability and based on the payoff of the neighbors with small probability , which we refer respectively as voter and game steps . in contrast , the model considered in this paper only accounts for game steps , so the duality techniques  @xcite developed for voter model perturbations are no longer available tools to study the process .",
    "the main objective is to study the limiting behavior of the spatial stochastic process and confront our results with the limiting behavior of the replicator equation in order to understand the effects of the inclusion of space",
    ".    * model description . *",
    "the process studied in this paper , which we again refer to as the death - birth updating process following the terminology in  @xcite , is a spin system on the  @xmath0-dimensional integer lattice where each vertex is occupied by a player characterized by one of two possible strategies , say strategy  1 and strategy  2 .",
    "the state at time  @xmath1 is a function @xmath2 the dynamics of this process or any other spatial game is defined in a couple of steps : we first fix a payoff matrix , which allows us to turn every spatial configuration of strategies into a so - called payoff landscape , which can then be used to define the transition rates at each vertex .",
    "since we focus on games with two strategies , the payoff matrix is a  @xmath3 matrix  @xmath4 whose coefficients are positive real numbers interpreted as @xmath5 in nonspatial evolutionary games , players interact equally with any other player in the population , making their payoff a function of the global frequency of representatives of each strategy .",
    "in contrast , spatial games assume that the payoff of a player depends exclusively on the strategy of a finite set of neighbors , which is the key to designing more realistic models with local interactions . throughout this paper ,",
    "the interaction neighborhood of vertex  @xmath6 is the set @xmath7 where the constant  @xmath8 is called the range of the interactions .",
    "letting  @xmath9 be the number of neighbors of the player at vertex  @xmath6 following strategy  @xmath10 , every spatial configuration  @xmath11 is then turned into a payoff landscape by attributing the payoff @xmath12 to the player at vertex  @xmath6 . in words ,",
    "each type  @xmath13 player receives  @xmath14 from each of her neighbors following strategy  @xmath10 .",
    "the last step to define the dynamics of the process is to follow  @xcite and interpret the payoff as fitness .",
    "the basic idea here is to write the rate at which a player changes her strategy as a function of her payoff and the payoff of her neighbors in such a way that players with a larger payoff are more likely to spread their strategy .",
    "there are multiple options .",
    "for instance , the updating rules considered in  @xcite are as follows .",
    "* best - response dynamics  @xcite .",
    "players update their strategy at rate one in order to maximize their payoff , which depends on the strategy of their neighbors .",
    "* payoff affecting birth and death rates  @xcite . in this process ,",
    "when a player has a positive payoff , at rate this payoff , one of her neighbors chosen at random adopts her strategy , whereas when her payoff is negative , at rate minus this payoff , she adopts the strategy of one of her neighbors chosen at random . this updating rule is inspired from  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the death - birth updating process is built using a similar approach : we assume that players update their strategy at rate one by mimicking a random neighbor , with each neighbor being chosen with a probability proportional to her payoff .",
    "more precisely , letting  @xmath11 be the configuration of the system , the player at  @xmath6 switches her strategy  @xmath15 at rate @xmath16 this model , or to be more specific , a closely related version of this model , has been introduced and studied heuristically in  @xcite while  @xcite give rigorous results .",
    "the process considered in these works can be seen as the weak selection approximation of the model described by  .",
    "players again update their strategy at rate one but , at the time of the update ,    * with probability  @xmath17 , the player mimics the strategy of a neighbor chosen uniformly at random , just like in the voter model  @xcite , while * with probability  @xmath18 , the player mimics a neighbor chosen at random according to probabilities that are proportional to the neighbors payoff , as described by  .",
    "this model is studied in  @xcite when  @xmath18 is small , in which case duality techniques for voter model perturbations are available .",
    "in contrast , we study the process when  @xmath19 , in which case duality can not be used , which leads to more qualitative and less quantitative results .    *",
    "the replicator equation . * before studying the spatial game , it is worth taking a quick look at its nonspatial deterministic analog to later identify disagreements between both models and thus understand the effect of the inclusion of space in the form of local interactions .",
    "the nonspatial model is obtained by assuming that the population of players is well - mixing , which results in a system of ordinary differential equations for the frequency of each strategy . in the case of the death - birth process , this is a time - change of the replicator equation : @xmath20 where  @xmath21 is the frequency of players following strategy  @xmath10 and @xmath22 are the common payoffs of all type  1 and all type  2 players , respectively .",
    "this can be viewed as the nonspatial analog of the payoff landscape  .",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite , the limiting behavior can be conveniently described by introducing the parameters @xmath23 and calling strategy  @xmath13 selfish whenever  @xmath24 and altruistic whenever  @xmath25 .",
    "then , following the usual terminology by calling a strategy an evolutionary stable strategy if it can not be invaded by any alternative strategy starting at an infinitesimally small frequency , some basic algebra shows that the behavior of the replicator equation   is as follows :    * when  @xmath26 , the selfish strategy always outcompetes the altruistic strategy , showing that the selfish strategy is the only evolutionary stable strategy , * when  @xmath27 , there is an unstable interior fixed point so the system is bistable , showing that the two ( selfish ) strategies are evolutionary stable , * when  @xmath28 , there is a globally stable interior fixed point so both strategies coexist and none of the two ( altruistic ) strategies is evolutionary stable .    in summary",
    ", the analysis of the replicator equation shows that , when the population is well - mixing , a strategy is an evolutionary stable strategy if it is selfish but not if it is altruistic .    * main results for the spatial game . * in order to compare the spatial game with its nonspatial analog , we assume that the process starts from a spatially homogeneous distribution , i.e. , a product measure in which the density of each of the two strategies is constant across the lattice .",
    "since the two configurations in which all players follow the same strategy are absorbing states , we also assume , to avoid trivialities , that the density of each strategy is positive . for the spatial game ,    * strategy  @xmath10 wins when  @xmath29 , * strategy  @xmath10 survives when  @xmath30 ,    a strategy is said to go extinct when it does not survive and both strategies are said to coexist when they both survive .",
    "note that the two probabilities above do not depend on the choice of vertex  @xmath6 because both the initial distribution and the evolution rules are translation invariant . from now on ,",
    "we assume without loss of generality that  @xmath31 and study the limiting behavior of the process as the other two payoffs vary .",
    "to begin with , we look at the parameter region where both strategies are altruistic , in which case coexistence occurs when the population is well - mixing .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that , except in the one - dimensional nearest neighbor case , coexistence is again possible for the spatial game though the coexistence region is reduced .",
    "the smaller the spatial dimension and/or the range of the interactions , the smaller the coexistence region .",
    "our first two theorems show that coexistence is indeed possible and that the coexistence region for the spatial game is indeed reduced .",
    "more precisely , theorem  [ th : coex ] shows that , regardless of the spatial dimension , both strategies coexist when they are sufficiently altruistic and the range of the interactions is sufficiently large .    ",
    "[ th : coex ] there is  @xmath32 such that coexistence occurs when @xmath33    to prove that the coexistence region is reduced , and more generally identify parameter regions in which one strategy wins , we first observe that , when  @xmath34 and  @xmath35 , the process is significantly simplified because the payoff of the players only depends on their strategy but not on the strategy of their neighbors . indeed , in this case   reduces to @xmath36 for  @xmath37 , therefore the transition rates become @xmath38 for  @xmath39 .",
    "it follows that , under our general assumption  @xmath40 , the set of type  2 players dominates stochastically a certain biased voter model  @xcite , thus showing that , in this very special case , strategy  2 wins . elaborating on this idea but using coupling arguments to compare the death - birth updating process with spin systems which are more complicated than the biased voter model",
    ", we can prove much more , as shown in the next theorem .",
    " [ th : coupling ] recall that  @xmath41 and let  @xmath42",
    ". then ,    * strategy  1 wins when  @xmath43 , * strategy  2 wins when  @xmath44 and @xmath45    figure  [ fig : diagram-2d ] shows the parameter regions in both parts of the theorem .",
    "note that the parameter region in the first part of the theorem is nonempty if and only if @xmath46 the figure shows this region for  @xmath47 , i.e. , in the presence of one - dimensional nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "in contrast , the parameter region in the second part of the theorem is always nonempty and , more interestingly , it always overlaps the region where both strategies are altruistic as well as the region where both strategies are selfish .",
    "this shows that the inclusion of a spatial structure in the form of local interactions indeed reduces the coexistence region , as mentioned above .",
    "this also shows that , in a subset of the parameter region where the replicator equation is bistable , there is instead a strong type for the spatial game that wins even starting at low density .",
    "the next theorem goes a little bit further in this direction by showing that , no matter how selfish a strategy is , the other strategy always wins if it is selfish enough .    ",
    "[ th : growth ] for all  @xmath32 there is  @xmath48 such that strategy  1 wins when @xmath49    note that , contrary to theorem  [ th : coupling ] , this theorem does not assume that  @xmath40 , therefore it also extends the parameter region where strategy  2 wins found before .",
    "the results collected so far indicate interesting discrepancies between the death - birth updating process and the replicator equation , showing the importance of local interactions .",
    "the most interesting aspect suggested by spatial simulations is the existence of a subset of the parameter region corresponding to the prisoner s dilemma game in which cooperators win on the lattice whereas they always lose when the population is well - mixing .",
    "the prisoner s dilemma game is characterized by the following ordering and terminology of the four payoffs : @xmath50 figure  [ fig : diagram-1d ] shows the corresponding triangular region in solid lines .",
    "players with strategy  1 are called cooperators while players with strategy  2 are called defectors .",
    "because the reward is not as good as the temptation , and the punishment is not as bad as the sucker s payoff , cooperators are altruistic and defectors selfish , therefore defectors indeed win when the population is well - mixing .",
    "in contrast , the heuristic arguments in  @xcite suggest that there is a subset of the prisoner s dilemma triangle in which cooperators are favored over defectors on regular graphs .",
    "this has been proved in  @xcite for finite , connected , simple graphs , and in  @xcite for integer lattices with  @xmath51 .",
    "their results , however , hold in the weak selection case but not for the process  .",
    "we now study the interactions among cooperators and defectors in one dimension , the main difficulty being the lack of attractiveness of the process .",
    "to state our last result , we introduce the following quantities that will be interpreted later as drift of a certain interface : @xmath52 then , we have the following theorem .    ",
    "[ th : dilemma ] assume  @xmath53 .",
    "then , strategy  1 wins when @xmath54    note that the parameter region given by the theorem overlaps but is not restricted to the prisoner s dilemma triangle . to see that the theorem implies the existence of a subset of the triangle in which cooperators win ,",
    "observe that , when  @xmath55 , @xmath56 in particular , the first parameter region given by the theorem in which cooperators win indeed overlap the prisoner s dilemma triangle .",
    "the theorem also implies that strategy  2 wins in the parameter regions obtained by exchanging the role of the two strategies .",
