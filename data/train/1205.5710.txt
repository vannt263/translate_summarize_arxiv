    "the study of the phase transition of frustrated spin systems on two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattices is a central problem in modern condensed mater physics .",
    "a competition of exchange interaction can lead to frustration , where spatial arrangement of magnetic ions in a crystal for which a simultaneous antiparallel ordering of all interacting spin is impossible .",
    "in particular , one of the frustrated 2d models most discussed is the quantum spin-@xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice with competing nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) antiferromagnetic exchange interactions ( known as @xmath12 model ) @xcite .",
    "the criticality of this @xmath12 heisenberg model on a square lattice are relatively well known at @xmath13 .",
    "there are two magnetically long - range ordered phases at small and at large values of @xmath6 separated by an intermediate quantum paramagnetic phase without magnetic long - range order in the region between @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where the properties of these disordered phase are still under intensive debate . for @xmath16 @xmath17 , the system possesses antiferromagnetic ( af ) long - range order with wave vector @xmath18 , with a staggered magnetization smaller than the saturated value ( quantum fluctuations ) , which vanished continuously when @xmath19 .",
    "for @xmath20 we have two degenerate collinear states which are the helical states with pitch vectors @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "these two collinear states are characterized by a parallel spin orientation of nearest neighbors in vertical ( or horizontal ) direction and an antiparallel spin orientation of nearest neighbors in horizontal ( or vertical ) direction , and therefore exhibit nel order within the initial sublattice a and b. at @xmath23 , the magnetization jumps from a nonzero to a zero value .",
    "the phase transition from nel to the quantum paramagnetic state is second order , whereas the transition from the collinear to the quantum paramagnetic state is first order@xcite .",
    "et al_.@xcite have shown that the intermediate quantum paramagnetic is a ( _ singlet _ ) plaquette crystal , and the ground and first excited states are separated by a finite gap .",
    "the interest to study the two - dimensional @xmath12 heisenberg antiferromagnet have been greatly stimulated by its experimental realization in vanadium phosphates compounds@xcite , such as li@xmath24vosio@xmath25 , li@xmath24vogeo@xmath25 , and  vomoo@xmath25 , which might be described by this frustrated model in the case of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "these isostructural compounds are characterized by a layered structure containing v@xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) ions .",
    "the structure of v@xmath28 layer suggest that the superexchange is similar . in these compounds a second order phase transition to a long - range ordered magnetic phase has been observed .",
    "nmr spin - lattice relaxation measurements@xcite below @xmath30 shows that the order is collinear . due to the two - fold degeneracy of the ground - state for @xmath31",
    "it is not possible to say _ a priori _ which will be the magnetic wave vector ( i.e. , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) below @xmath30 . on the other hand ,",
    "such a scenario can change by considering spin - lattice coupling which will lift the degeneracy of the ground - state and will lower its energy@xcite .",
    "then , any structural distortion should inevitably reduce this competing interactions and thus reduces the frustration . in the case of  this",
    "frustrated magnetic materials , the competing interactions are inequivalent but their topology and magnitudes can be tuned so that the strong quantum fluctuations destroy the long - range ordering .",
    "experimentally the ground state phase diagram of frustrated compounds , described by the @xmath12 model , can be explored continuously from high to the low @xmath6 regime by applying high pressures ( p ) , which modify the bonding lengths and angles .",
    "recent results from x - ray diffraction measurements@xcite on the li@xmath24vosio@xmath25 compound has shown that the ratio @xmath8 decreases by about @xmath32 when the pressure increases from @xmath33 to @xmath34gpa .",
    "a generalization of the @xmath12 heisenberg antiferromagnetic model on a square lattice was introduced by nersesyan and tsvelik@xcite and studied by other groups@xcite , the so - called @xmath35 model . in the @xmath36 model",
    "is considered inequivalence nn couplings @xmath1 and @xmath37 in the two orthogonal spatial lattice dimensions with all the nnn bonds across the diagonals to have the same strength @xmath3 .",
    "study of extensive band structure calculations@xcite for the vanadium phosphates abvo(po@xmath38)@xmath24 ( ab = pb@xmath24 , srzn , bazn , and bacd ) have indicated four inequivalent exchange couplings : @xmath1 and @xmath2 between nn and @xmath3 and @xmath39 between nnn .",
    "for example , in srznvo(po@xmath25)@xmath24 was estimated @xmath40 and @xmath41 causing a distortion of the spin lattice .",
    "this spatial anisotropy tends to narrow the critical region and destroys it completely at a certain value of the interchain parameter @xmath7 .",
    "on the other hand , by using the continuum limit of the @xmath36 spin-@xmath0 model starykh and balents@xcite have shown that this transition splits into two , with the presence of an intermediate quantum paramagnetic ( columnar dimer ) phase for @xmath42 .",
    "bishop , _ _",
    "et al__@xcite , by using coupled cluster treatment found the surprising and novel result that there exists a quantum triple point ( * qtp * ) with coordinates at ( @xmath43 ) , below which there is a second - order phase transition between the * af * and * caf * phases while above this * qtp * are these two ordered phases separated by the intermediate magnetically disordered phase ( vbs or rvb ) .",
    "the order parameters of both the * af * and * caf * phases vanish continuously both below and above the * qtp * , which is typical of second - order phase transition .",
    "there is some evidence that the transition between the * caf * and intermediate phases is of first - order .",
    "using exact diagonalization@xcite with small lattice of @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) size , the intermediate * qp * phase for all interval of @xmath46 $ ] has been obtained for the pure spin-@xmath0 @xmath12 model on a square lattice .",
    "these results are in accordance with results obtained by starykh and balentes@xcite , that predicted not the * qtp * in the ground - state phase diagram recently observed by bishop , _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "the ground state ( gs ) properties of the two - dimensional frustrated heisenberg antiferromagnet have been investigated by various methods .",
    "the exact diagonalization starts from singlet states on pairs of sites , which cover the whole 2d lattice .",
    "however , the manifold of these states which can be constructed is nonorthogonal and overcomplete .",
    "this numerical methods are limited to small clusters @xmath47 due to storage problems .",
    "the computation on the largest cluster @xmath45 has been performed by schulz and co - workes@xcite @xmath48 years ago . in spite of the great improvements achieved during this time , it is not possible so far to repeat this calculation for the next interesting cluster @xmath49 .",
    "this is only possible with other technique , as the quantum monte carlo simulation . due to the progress in computer hardware and the increased efficiency in programing , very recently@xcite the gs of the quantum spin-1/2 @xmath12 model",
    "have been calculated by the lanczos algoritm for a square lattice with @xmath50  sites .",
    "the theoretical treatment of the frustrated quantum models is far from being trivial .",
    "many of the standard many - body methods , such as quantum monte carlo techniques , may fail or become computationally infeasible to implement if frustration is present due to the minus - sign problem .",
    "hence , there is considerable interest in any method that can deal with frustrated spin systems .",
    "this considerable qualitative difference in the ground state phase diagram in the @xmath51 plane of the quantum spin-@xmath0 @xmath52 model further motivates us to study this issue by alternative methods .    using a variational approximation , in which plaquettes of four spins are treated exactly ,",
    "oliveira@xcite has studied the ground state phase diagram of the pure @xmath12 heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice , where the quantitative results are in good accordance with a more sophisticated method ( exact diagonalization ) . in this work",
    ", we generalize this variational method to treat the anisotropic square lattice ( @xmath52 model ) .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , the model is presented and a brief discussion of results . in sec .",
    "iii , the method is applied for the case of one plaquette with four spins interacting with other plaquette type mean field approximation .",
    "main results will be presented in sec .",
    "iv , as well as some discussions . finally , in sec .",
    "v we will give a brief summary .",
    "the critical behavior of the quantum spin-@xmath0 @xmath12 heisenberg model has been studied for many years , but very little has been done in the anisotropic square lattice case , which is described by following hamiltonian : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the spin-@xmath0 pauli spin operators , the index @xmath55 labels the @xmath56 ( row ) and @xmath57 ( column ) components of the lattice sites .",
    "the first sum runs over all nn and the second sum runs over all nnn pairs .",
    "we denote the hamiltonian ( 1 )  by @xmath35 model , with strength @xmath1 along the row direction , @xmath37 along the column direction , @xmath58 along the diagonals , and we assume all couplings to be positive with @xmath59 .",
    "the classical ( @xmath60 ) model ( 1 ) has only two ordered ground - states : * af * ( or nel ) for @xmath61 and columnar stripe ( * caf * ) for @xmath62 separated by a first - order line at @xmath63 . quantum fluctuations play a significant role in the magnetic phase diagram of the system at zero temperature .",
    "we will investigate the role of quantum fluctuations on the stability of the nel and collinear phases . in the @xmath29 case ( quantum limit )",
    ", the line splits into two phase transitions , where the ordered states ( * af * and * caf * ) are separated by an intermediate quantum paramagnetic ( * qp * ) phase , both on a square lattice .",
    "exact diagonalization@xcite has estimated a critical line at @xmath64 , for the transition between the * caf * and * qp * states , and at @xmath65 between the * af * and * qp * states .",
    "the phase diagram in the @xmath51 plane obtained is in accordance with starykh and balents@xcite .",
    "however , the existence of * qtp * ( _ quantum triple point _ ) that was predicted by bishop , _",
    "et al_.@xcite , is not present in their obtained phase diagram .",
    "moreover , they found only presence of second - order phase transitions in the phase diagram .",
    "this contradictory qualitative results ( existence or not of * qtp * ) is the primary motivation behind this present work .    on the other hand , a critical endpoint ( * ce * )",
    "is a point in the phase diagram where a critical line meets and is truncated by a first - order line .",
    "this * ce * appear in the phase diagram of many physical systems such as binary fluid mixtures , superfluids , binary alloys , liquid crystals , certain ferromagnets , etc , and have been known for over a century@xcite . despite the * ce * long history , new singularities at the * ce * were predicted .",
    "fisher and upton@xcite argued that a new singularity in the curvature of the first - order phase transition line should arise at a * ce*. this prediction was confirmed by fisher and barbosas@xcite phenomenological studies for an exactly solvable spherical model . in conclusion of the analysis of",
