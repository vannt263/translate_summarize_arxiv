    "the importance , complexity and ubiquity of the notions of _ infection _ and _ inflammation _ are well explained by the following quotation @xcite : _ the ` inflammatory process ' includes a tissue - based startle reaction to trauma ; go / no - go decisions based on integration of molecular clues for tissue penetration by microbes ; the beckoning , instruction and dispatch of cells ; the killing of microbes and host cells they infect ; liquefaction of surrounding tissue to prevent microbial metastasis ; and the healing of tissues damaged by trauma or by the host s response .",
    "if at any step an order to proceed is issued but progress to the next step is blocked , the inflammatory process may detour into a holding pattern , such as infiltration of a tissue with aggregates of lymphocytes and leukocytes ( granulomas ) that are sometimes embedded in proliferating synovial fibroblasts ( pannus ) , or distortion of a tissue with collagen bundles ( fibrosis ) .",
    "persistent inflammation can oxidize dna badly enough to promote neoplastic transformation . _",
    "according to @xcite , _ the overall mortality is approximately @xmath0 , rising to @xmath1 in the elderly and is @xmath2 or greater in patients with the more severe syndrome_. the corresponding literature is of course huge .",
    "see , _ e.g _",
    ",    * @xcite on the cause , * @xcite for the connections with cancer , * @xcite for the interactions with the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) .",
    "* @xcite for the possible relationship with depression .",
    "although applying automatic control to immune therapy has attracted some interest , as depicted in @xcite , it is much less developed than in other domains , like , _",
    "e.g. _ , for insulin - dependent diabetes ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite , and the references therein ) .",
    "let us nevertheless mention promising papers using respectively optimal control ( @xcite ) and predictive control ( @xcite ) .",
    "those approaches are model - based . among those papers , the most recent ones ( @xcite ) use the same set of phenomenological ordinary differential equations from @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) :    * the corresponding model is based on the non - specific protective mechanism , namely , the _ innate immune response _ , in contrast to the _ adaptive immune system_. the latter provides a more advanced and strategic response producing @xmath3 and @xmath4 cells together with specific antibodies . * anti - inflammatory mediators are included",
    ". they play an important rle to mitigate a severe inflammation and , therefore , avoid tissue damage and high pathogen proliferation . *",
    "its biological relevance has been confirmed via a good qualitative reproduction of severe systemic inflammation in a biological organism .",
    "other mathematical modelings have been proposed ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) . in spite of interesting preliminary results in @xcite , state observation and parameter identification",
    "are not yet fully mastered .",
    "its calibration , which depends heavily on the type of inflammatory response and on patient differences ( genetics , age , gender ,  ) , is therefore most intricate .",
    "this paper suggests another route , namely the recent model - free setting and the corresponding `` intelligent '' controllers @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to recall that model - free control has already been successfully applied in quite diverse case - studies ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite in the field of `` life engineering '' ) .",
    "the modeling remains nevertheless irreplaceable at this stage for _ in silico _ testing , _ i.e. _ , for computer simulations .",
    "we will also be employing @xcite .",
    "let us emphasize the following key point : there is no need for the proposed control technique to use any state observer and any parameter identification technique .    from a purely control - theoretic standpoint ,",
    "a major novelty of this study lies in the necessity to drive sensorless states .",
    "the poor knowledge of the system makes the derivation of an observer quite intractable .",
    "the solution lies in a `` good understanding '' of the system , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the design of an `` efficient '' reference trajectories tracking with respect to the states with sensors .",
    "such a feedforward `` philosophy '' is of course inspired by flatness - based control ( see @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "sections [ model ] and [ mfc ] review respectively the mathematical modeling and model - free control .",

    "see tables i and ii for the numerical values of the parameters and of the initial conditions .",
    "the above model possesses three steady states :    * one which corresponds to the healthy equilibrium , * two which are associated respectively with a septic state and an aseptic one .",
    "those properties agree with clinical observations :    * the healthy equilibrium corresponds to @xmath16 and @xmath15 at a background level . *",
    "a septic equilibrium is related to the situation where all mediators , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath17 together with the pathogen @xmath13 are rather high . *",
    "the patient is in an aseptic equilibrium when the values of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath17 are important , while the pathogen has been eliminated , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath18 .",
    "see in figure [ fig : fig1 ] the results of two virtual patients with different initial conditions .",
    "the presence of pathogen in the body stimulates inherently the activation of phagocytes ( pro - inflammatory mediator ) .",
    "the resulting damage is affected by the degree of inflammation which tries to eliminate the actual pathogen as quickly as possible .",
    "note that the actual anti - inflammatory mediator ( cortisol and interleukin-10 ) can mitigate the inflammation and its harmful effect .",

    ", its maximum is reached after about 10 to 15 hours and is followed by an exponential decrease to zero .",
    "as shown by figure [ fig : fig2](a ) , the analogous behavior of the anti - inflammatory mediator @xmath15 is much slower .",
    "similar facts are observed with all patients who do not necessitate any treatment .",
    "the motivation for the choice of the reference trajectories should now become clear .",
    "the similarities of the generated doses can be partly explained by the same choice of the reference trajectory . in this case",
    ", it was enough to stabilize both patients .",
    "observe that for each dose associated with an increase of the pro - inflammatory mediator a lower dose of anti - inflammation follows ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it may be explained by the fact the immune system needs an initial boost of activated phagocytes in order to eliminate the pathogen threat .",
    "the resulting inflammation causes an increase of tissue damage , observed in figure [ fig : fig4](a ) , which decreases after to zero thanks in part to the anti - inflammatory dose that is applied with a longer duration .",
    "notice that injecting a larger dose of @xmath87 at the wrong time and with an inappropriate amplitude may foster the development of pathogen @xmath13 at rates that can drive the patient to a no - return point .",
    "our results should of course be further tested and developed .",
    "future publications will emphasize    * the robustness of our setting with respect to parameter variation and different initial conditions , * a deeper understanding of the choice of `` good '' reference trajectories , * the applicability of our approach to most types of inflammations and virtual patients .",
