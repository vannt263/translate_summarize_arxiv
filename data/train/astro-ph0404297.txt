    "the ultraluminous infrared galaxy mkn231 , which at 170mpc distance has @xmath1l@xmath2 , hosts an agn that , with @xmath3 , is often classed as a qso . however , it is now clear that a significant fraction of its luminosity infact originates in star formation , making mkn231 a key object for investigations into whether or not ulirgs evolve into qsos .",
    "the structural and kinematic properties of this and other late stage ulirg mergers have been studied by @xcite to investigate whether they might evolve later into ( intermediate mass , @xmath4 ) ellipticals ; and by @xcite to test if , once rid of their gas and dust shells , they might be the progenitors of qsos . as a sample ,",
    "the ulirgs appear to have elliptical - like properties : relaxed stellar populations with @xmath5 radial luminosity profiles , and velocity dispersions of @xmath6180  with only moderate rotation .",
    "based on numerical simulations of mergers between gas rich spirals , this is what one might expect since most ulirgs , including mkn231 , exhibit the huge tidal tails typical of such mergers .",
    "however , mkn231 presents a puzzle since its stellar velocity dispersion of 115  is rather small , yielding both a low bulge mass and a low m@xmath7 , which results in a highly super - eddington agn luminosity .",
    "adaptive optics observations on the keck  ii telescope , which are summarised here and described fully in @xcite , have resolved this problem .",
    "if the mean stellar type dominating the nuclear stellar h - band continuum does not vary too much , the 1.63  co6 - 3 bandhead absorption ` flux ' traces the spatial extent of the stars .",
    "[ fig : mkn231 ] ( left ) shows that this profile is different to the continuum , which has a strong narrow core originating in dust heated by the agn .",
    "distinguishing between the de  vaucouleurs @xmath5 and exponential fits to the stellar profile is crucial for our understanding of the geometry of the star forming region .",
    "hence in fig  [ fig : mkn231 ] ( right ) we plot the logarithm of the profiles as functions of @xmath5 , on which scaling the de  vaucouleurs profile appears as a straight line .",
    "it is then clear that an @xmath5 law does not match the data at larger radii , and that its @xmath8 is inconsistent with the scales on which the star formation is seen . on the other hand , an exponential profile with @xmath9",
    "does match the data , indicating that the stars lie in a disk rather than a spheroid .",
    "a nearly face - on ( @xmath10=@xmath11 ) molecular disk is already known to exist in mkn231 .",
    "we need to consider whether our result that the stars lie in the same disk is consistent with the stellar kinematics of @xcite , who found @xmath12  and @xmath13 . using the properties of the molecular disk at @xmath14  ( @xmath15 , m@xmath16m@xmath2 , scale height 23pc ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* downes & solomon 1998 ) ) gives a mean velocity dispersion perpendicular to the disk plane of 80 .",
    "putting in also an exponential profile as above , accounting for seeing , and repeating the observations of @xcite yields @xmath17  and an apparent @xmath18 .",
    "this means that a nearly face - on stellar disk can  in the right circumstances  masquerade as a spheroid .",
    "the fraction of h - band light due to stars is found from the equivalent width of the co6 - 3 bandhead , @xmath19 .",
    "the stellar luminosity one derives can then be used in starburst models , yielding a minimum mass ( occuring when late type supergiants dominate the continuum , at an age of @xmath610myr ) of @xmath20m@xmath2 out to @xmath14 .",
    "the upper limit to the age and mass is set by m@xmath21 . at 0.6",
    ", we find m@xmath22m@xmath2 ( half of that derived by @xcite , since we measure @xmath23 ) . accounting for the gas mass leaves at most @xmath24m@xmath2 of stars . hence , from starburst models , the maximum age of the stars is 120myr .",
    "this remarkably young age is supported by other observations of pah features ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rigopoulou  1999 ) ) , mid infrared emission lines ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* genzel  1998 ) ) , the infrared spectral energy distribution ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* verma 1999 ) ) , and the radio continuum ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* carilli  1998 ) ) .",
    "our results show that the stars we see lie in a disk rather than a spheroid , and so @xmath25 can not be used to estimate m@xmath7 .",
    "being so young , it is likely that the stars formed _ in situ _ in the nearly face - on gas disk , which is itself a product of the merger that created mkn231 .",
    "the seyfert  1 galaxy ngc7469 , at a distance 66mpc , is a luminous infrared source with @xmath26l@xmath2 .",
    "much of the interest in the galaxy has been focussed on the circumnuclear ring structure on scales of 1.52.5 , which has been observed at many wavelengths .",
    "these data suggest that recent star formation in this ring contributes more than half the galaxy s bolometric luminosity .",
    "additionally , up to 1/3 of the k - band continuum within 1  of the nucleus may also originate in stellar processes ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* mazarella  1994 , genzel  1995 ) ) .",
    "ngc7469 is therefore a key object for studying the relation between circumnuclear star formation and an agn , and how gas is driven in to the nucleus to fuel these processes .",
    "bringing together the unique combination of high resolution mm co2 - 1 data from the iram plateau de bure interferometer and near infrared adaptive optics h@xmath0 1 - 0s(1 ) data from the keck  ii telescope , gives us a tool which can probe the distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas across nearly 2 orders of magnitude in spatial scale .",
    "here we summarise our results , which are described fully in @xcite .",
    "our 0.7  228ghz co2 - 1 data of ngc7469 show a number of distinct components : a broad disk ; a ring of molecular clouds at a radius of 2.3 , located outside the well - known ring of star forming knots ; a bar or loosely wound spiral arms leading in from the ring ; and an extended nucleus which , based also on the ao data , we interpret as a ring at radius 0.2 .",
    "an axisymmetric disk model is able to replicate the kinematics of this cold molecular gas , as well as the hot molecular gas traced by the 1 - 0s(1 ) line at much higher spatial resolution .",
    "the latter is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc7469 ] which emphasizes the extended nature of the nucleus : if it were compact , the rotation curve would be much steeper than is observed .",
    "in contrast to the mass , the 1 - 0s(1 ) flux is compact , indicating that it does not trace the gas distribution .",
    "it is likely that the core 1 - 0s(1 ) arises in gas excited by uv and x - ray irradiation from the agn , and its distribution depends primarily on the high energy photon density rather than gas density .    using the 2.29  co2 - 0 bandhead we can resolve the nuclear star forming region , which has fwhm 0.22  and 0.12  at the 2 pas , indicating a size scale of @xmath640pc .",
    "the fraction of k - band light due to stars is determined from both the slope of the continuum and @xmath19 to be 2030% .",
    "based on the derived stellar luminosity , starburst models then indicate that the minimum mass of stars within a radius of 0.1  is @xmath27m@xmath2 ( occuring if the age is only 10myr , when late type supergiants dominate the near infrared stellar continuum ) .",
    "the maximum mass is constrained by m@xmath21 to be @xmath28m@xmath2 , requiring an age no greater than 60myr .",
    "thus , the stars in this cluster are very young , lie predominantly within the molecular gas ring at 0.2 , and account for most of the mass on this scale .",
    "we have presented h- and k - band adaptive optics observations which clearly resolve the nuclear star forming regions in the centres of 2 type  1 agn .",
    "constraining starburst models using the fraction of stellar light determined from @xmath19 and the dynamics measured from the h@xmath0 1 - 0s(1 ) line ( and , where possible , stellar features ) , indicates that the nuclear star forming regions are extremely young and constitute a significant fraction of the total mass on these scales . in mkn231 it is likely that the stars have formed in the molecular disk of effective radius 160200pc which has resulted from the merger of gas rich spirals ; in ngc7469 the star cluster lies inside a molecular ring of radius 65pc ."
