    "we will show that the gaussian closure approximation works fairly well for the nonconserved heisenberg model with @xmath90 and leads to conclusions similar to the ones described in the previous section . in contrast , the use of the gaussian closure in conserved models leads to sharp inconsistencies .",

    "we numerically evaluate the spectral density , the fourier transform of @xmath110 .",
    "we observe @xcite that the spectral density , which should be a strictly positive function of its arguments , becomes negative for @xmath111 ( @xmath112 is peaked at @xmath113 ) and in the range @xmath114 !",
    "this demonstration highlights the intrinsic inconsistency of the gaussian approach for conserved vector order parameters .",
    "4 . scaling plot of the un - normalised @xmath107 for @xmath37 at different times @xmath115 .",
    "we have just seen that the mazenko assumption of a gaussian probability distribution fails sharply when the dynamics conserves the total magnetisation .",
    "this seems to lead to an interesting technical problem .",
    "coniglio and zannetti @xcite had explicitly shown that the late time dynamics of a conserved @xmath116-component spin model in the limit @xmath117 reveals an infinity of length scales leading to a more complicated multiscaling form for the structure factor ( fourier transform of @xmath24 ) @xmath118 .",

    "subsequent numerical work showed that for the scalar ( @xmath122)@xcite , the xy ( @xmath123)@xcite and @xmath124@xcite models , the structure factor obeyed the conventional ` single length ' scaling form .",
    "this suggested the possibility that multiscaling was nongeneric and an ` aberration ' of the @xmath117 model , though there was no general proof .",
    "bray and humayun ( bh ) @xcite provided such a ` proof ' .",
    "their analysis was built on the validity of the mazenko gaussian assumption for all values of @xmath116 . performing a @xmath125 expansion within the mazenko framework",

    "we now show that the structure factor @xmath126 of the conserved @xmath128 model does not obey multiscaling , consistent with the main conclusion of bh .",
    "this is done using the method described in @xcite .",
    "the method @xcite demands a very accurate determination of @xmath129 .",
    "since the numerical evaluation of @xmath126 is subject to large errors ( especially at small @xmath130 ) , we fit a function @xmath131 to the computed @xmath24 and then calculate the fourier transform @xmath132 .",
    "the fitting function for @xmath133 has been taken as @xmath134 which is similar to the analytic form given in @xcite .",
    "note that only @xmath135 and @xmath136 are independent fitting parameters , @xmath137 is determined by the condition @xmath138 .",
    "we now plot @xmath139 versus @xmath71 at fixed values of @xmath140 ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "the resulting straight lines labeled by different values of @xmath141 , all show a constant slope of approximately @xmath142 ( fig . 5 ) . using the proposed multiscaling form , a plot of @xmath143 versus @xmath141 ( inset fig .",
    "5 ) shows that @xmath143 is clustered around @xmath144 .",
    "the small spread of @xmath143 around @xmath144 indicates that we have not quite reached the asymptotic regime , and it is likely that the late time @xmath145 , in agreement with conventional scaling .",
    "in addition , note that the form of @xmath143 is qualitatively different from the downward curving @xmath143 predicted by coniglio and zannetti @xcite .",

    "inset figure shows plot of @xmath143 with @xmath141 .",
    "note that the errors in @xmath143 increases as @xmath154 increases because of the smallness of @xmath126 near its wings .",
    "thus we are forced to conclude that since the mazenko assumption is invalid for conserved vector order parameters ( except when @xmath127 ) , an analytical proof of the absence of multiscaling of the asymptotic structure factor is still lacking .",
    "we have also studied the asymptotic dynamics following a quench to the critical point @xcite . we ask for whether the torque @xmath34 is relevant at the wilson - fisher fixed point of the pure @xmath37 heisenberg model , both when the magnetisation is conserved and nonconserved .",
