    "ever since the spontaneous symmetry breakdown of a vacuum was found in field theory , its implications to the history of our universe have been a matter of great interest in cosmology and much work has been done on how the vacuum decay proceeds dynamically .",
    "one of the most important contributions to the understanding of the vacuum decay was made by coleman who developed a method to describe the vacuum decay by considering @xmath0 symmetric instantons that mediate the vacuum decay  @xcite . in this picture",
    ", one assumes there is a scalar field with potential having two ( or more ) minima with at least one meta - stable minimum and an absolute minimum . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume there is only one meta - stable minimum ( false vacuum ) and only one absolute minimum ( true vacuum ) .",
    "if the universe is in the false vacuum in the beginning , it decays into the true vacuum via bubble nucleation .    in the original paper by coleman , however , the effect of gravity was not taken into account .",
    "hence it was not so clear when and how gravity could affect the process .",
    "then the false vacuum decay in the presence of gravity was studied in detail by coleman and de luccia  @xcite .",
    "although limited by the thin - wall assumption , they successfully clarified several important issues , for example the fact that the size of the bubble should always be smaller than the hubble horizon scale of the false vacuum .",
    "subsequently , hawking and moss argued that a homogeneous instanton sitting at a maximum of the potential dominates the false vacuum decay if the barrier is too shallow  @xcite .",
    "later it was more clearly realized by jensen and steinhardt  @xcite that the coleman - de luccia ( cd ) instanton merges to the hawking - moss ( hm ) instanton as the potential gets flatter , and except for possible oscillating solutions  @xcite , there will be only hm solutions when @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the curvature of the potential at its maximum and @xmath3 is the corresponding hubble parameter , @xmath4 where @xmath5 .    concerning the false vacuum decay from a flat potential ,",
    "a very interesting observation was made by lee and weinberg  @xcite .",
    "they considered an unstable potential and another potential of similar shape except that it has a small barrier near the extremum of the potential .",
    "as the unstable potential becomes extremely flat at its extremum , the time scale for the field to roll down the potential classically would eventually exceed the time scale for the quantum vacuum decay of the corresponding potential with a barrier .",
    "if there were no tunneling solution for the unstable potential , this would lead to an unacceptable conclusion that the unstable potential is stabler than the corresponding potential with a barrier .",
    "indeed such a solution describing tunneling without barriers had been found by linde  @xcite prior to lee and weinberg  @xcite , who showed that there exists @xmath0-symmetric instantons for potentials without barriers , and rediscovered an exact analytical solution for @xmath6 potential ( @xmath7 ) found in  @xcite .",
    "however , neither linde nor lee and weinberg included the effect of gravity .",
    "it is then of great interest how gravity can modify the result .",
    "a pioneering study was done by lee  @xcite .",
    "recently an interesting oscillating solution was found for an inverted quadratic potential by lee et al .",
    "@xcite which would nt be possible without gravity . here",
    ", however , we focus on monotonic solutions .    in the presence of gravity ,",
    "the absolute value of the potential is very important .",
    "if the false vacuum has a positive potential energy , @xmath8 , it is in the de sitter phase with the hubble parameter @xmath9 . in this case , if we consider a flat potential without barriers , @xmath10 it is expected that the quantum decay of the unstable vacuum will be mediated by the hm instanton rather than the linde - lee - weinberg ( llw ) instanton .    on the other hand , in the limit @xmath11 , the universe at @xmath12 will no longer be de sitter but it is simply a flat minkowski space . in this limit , one would naturally expect the llw instanton to dominates the quantum vacuum decay ( of an unstable flat space ) . to clearly demonstrate this , and to show explicitly when the llw instanton takes over the hm instanton",
    ", we need a solution for the llw instanton in the presence of gravity .    in this paper , we present an exact , analytic solution of the llw instanton with gravity for a particular class of the potential having the form ( [ flatpot ] ) with @xmath13 . for this solution",
    "we also obtain an analytical expression for the value of the bounce action .",
    "then we briefly discuss possible implications of the solution to cosmology .",
    "we consider the euclidean action for a scalar field @xmath14 with gravity : @xmath15\\ , .",

    "for an asymptotically euclidean solution , we have @xmath18 for @xmath19 . under the @xmath0-symmetry",

    "\\label{hc1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we now construct an analytical llw instanton solution with gravity by extending the method developed in @xcite .",
    "namely , instead of giving the form of the potential first , we consider the condition on the form of the scale factor for the existence of a regular instanton solution and look for a function describing the scale factor that enables us to derive the potential as a function of the scalar field analytically .",
    "since we are interested in the case of asymptotically flat solution , we may assume the form of the scale factor @xmath26 as @xmath27 where the function @xmath28 is assumed to be regular at @xmath19 , and @xmath29 is an arbitrary length scale .",
    "this guarantees the asymptotic flatness of the metric . for convenience ,",

    "the thick line ( in green ) is the range the instanton runs .",

    "[ fig : llwpot ] . for @xmath66 , the range of @xmath14 that the instanton covers is small compared to the planck scale , @xmath67 . in this limit",

    "we note that the value of @xmath73 is arbitrary : it can be of order unity or larger , and hence the decay rate can become very large in principle .",
    "however , if we assume @xmath75 , the limit @xmath66 ( @xmath76 ) implies @xmath77 , ie , the low energy limit .",
    "one can also estimate an approximate size of the bubble .",
    "since the value of the scalar field at the center of the bubble is given by @xmath14 at @xmath78 , @xmath79 for @xmath66 , the radius at which the value of @xmath14 is half the value at the center , @xmath80 , is given approximately by @xmath81 .",
    "thus @xmath29 corresponds to the size of the bubble .",
    "we have found an exact , analytical llw instanton in the presence of gravity .",
    "the resulting bounce action reduces to that of the original llw instanton in flat space in the low energy limit , @xmath82    recently tunneling between different vacua through the false vacuum decay or even true vacuum decay  @xcite in the presence of gravity has attracted renewed interest in the context of the string theory landscape  @xcite . in the landscape , there are an exponentially large number of different vacua with different values of the vacuum energy , and tunneling between different vacua may occur frequently enough to result in various interesting consequences which may be observationally tested , for example , traces of bubble collisions  @xcite , traces of false vacuum prior to inflation  @xcite , etc .. here let us consider possible implications of llw instantons to cosmology .",
    "assuming there indeed exits a llw - type scalar field , let us first estimate the probability for a bubble to nucleate within our past light - cone .",
    "the nucleation rate per unit volume per unit time is estimated as @xmath83 then the probability for a bubble to nucleate within our past light - cone can be obtained by multiplying the above rate by the present hubble volume times the hubble time , @xmath84 where we have used the relation , @xmath85 . assuming @xmath66 and @xmath75 , the energy scale of the bubble @xmath86 is much smaller than the planck scale . in this case",
    "we have @xmath87 as we saw already .",
    "therefore , with an estimate that @xmath88 , we find @xmath89 \\approx\\frac{9\\lambda^2}{c^2 } \\exp\\left[550-\\frac{8\\pi^2}{3\\lambda}\\right]\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath66 , this will be exponentially smaller than unity for @xmath90 .",
    "in the above we have ignored the presence of dark energy . to see its effect ,",
    "let us consider the case where the false vacuum has an extremely small but non - vanishing vacuum energy with the hubble parameter , @xmath91 , such that @xmath92 .",
    "if we apply this case to the present universe , the value of @xmath91 is approximately equal to the present hubble constant @xmath93",
    ". then the universe appears almost flat over the length scale of @xmath29 , hence the use of the llw instanton which neglects the false vacuum energy is justified .",
    "we further assume that there is a small , very flat barrier and the hubble parameter at the top of the barrier also satisfies @xmath94 . in this case",
    ", there is a hm instanton and the bounce action will be given by @xmath95\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we compare this with the llw bounce action , we find @xmath96^{-1 } \\approx\\frac{h_f^2\\ell^2}{c}\\ll1\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] unless the value of @xmath97 is exponentially close to @xmath91 .",
    "thus the llw instanton will dominate the false vacuum decay in this situation .",
    "in other words , the presence of dark energy does not alter the physics of tunneling .",
    "the above consideration implies that if the potential near the false vacuum is extremely flat and the minimum is below zero , the vacuum decay will proceed much faster than what one would expect from the value of the bounce action for the hm instanton even if the potential at the false vacuum were positive . boldly applying this to the present universe with the vacuum energy density @xmath98 , the fact that there is",
    "no sign of the vacuum decay might mean either that there is no minimum with a negative energy density near the vacuum we live in or that the coupling constant @xmath73 is much smaller than unity , say @xmath90 .",
