    "the hadronic matrix elements of weak @xmath0 decays to a light pseudoscalar ( p ) and to a vector meson ( v ) are described by @xmath2 and @xmath3 transition form factors , respectively .",
    "these heavy - to - light form factors are essential to study the semileptonic and even non - leptonic @xmath0 decays .",
    "information on the form factors is crucial to test the mechanism of cp violation in the standard model and to extract the ckm parameters @xcite .",
    "for instance , the @xmath4 form factors are required to determine the ckm matrix element @xmath5 precisely . in @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "processes which are sensitive to new physics , the precise evaluation of @xmath3 form factors is indispensable .",
    "another interesting reason for the study of the form factors is that they provide an ideal laboratory to explore the rich structures of qcd dynamics . at the large recoil region where the final state light meson moves fast",
    ", the system contains internal information on both short and long distance qcd dynamics with the factorization theorem .",
    "there are already many methods calculating the heavy - to - light transition form factors in the literature such as simple quark model @xcite , the light cone quark models ( lcqm ) @xcite , the light cone sum rules ( lcsr ) @xcite , the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach based on @xmath8 factorization @xcite etc .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a model - independent way to look for relations between different form factors is suggested by analogy with the heavy - to - heavy transitions @xcite .",
    "one important observation is that in the heavy quark mass and large energy of light meson limit , the spin symmetry relates the form factors for @xmath2 and @xmath3 to three universal energy - dependent functions : @xmath9 for pseudoscalar meson ; and @xmath10 for longitudinally and transversely polarized vector meson , respectively .",
    "the development of soft collinear effective theory ( scet ) makes the analysis on a more rigorous foundation .",
    "the scet is a powerful method to systematically separate the dynamics at different scales : hard scale @xmath11 ( @xmath12 quark mass ) , hard intermediate scale @xmath13 , soft scale @xmath14 and to sum large logs using the renormalization group technics . after a series of researches @xcite ,",
    "a factorization formula is established for the form factors in the heavy quark mass and large energy limit as f_i(q^2)=c_i(e,_i)_j(_i , e)+_b(,_ii ) t_i(e , u,,_ii ) _",

    "the functions @xmath23 denote the universal functions that satisfies the spin symmetry .",
    "although soft collinear effective theory is really powerful and rigorous , the form factors @xmath23 can not be directly calculated .",

    "lattice simulation on heavy - to - light form factors is usually restricted to the region with final meson energy @xmath24 and can not be applied to our case directly where the light meson carries the energy of order @xmath25 .",
    "the construction of lcsr within scet has been explored recently in @xcite . in these studies , only the pseudoscalar meson form factor @xmath9 are calculated at present .",
    "the light cone field theory provides another natural language to study these processes .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , light cone qcd has some unique features which are particularly suitable to describe a hadronic bound state .",
    "for instance , the vacuum state in this approach is much simpler than that in other approaches .",
    "the light cone wave functions , which describe the hadron in terms of their fundamental quark and gluon degrees of freedom , are independent of the hadron momentum and thus are explicitly lorentz invariant .",
    "the light cone fock space expansion provides a complete relativistic many - particle basis for a hadron . for hard exclusive processes with large momentum transfer , factorization theorem in the perturbative light cone qcd makes first - principle predictions @xcite . for non - perturbative qcd , an approach which combines",
    "the advantage of light cone method with the low energy constituent quark model is more appealing .",
    "this approach , which we will call light cone quark model ( lcqm ) , has been successfully applied to the calculation of the meson decay constants and hadronic form factors @xcite .",
    "as far as the form factors are concerned , they can be generally represented by the convolution of @xmath0 and light meson wave functions in the light cone approach as f(q^2)=_n_1 , n_2\\ { } \\ { } _ m^(n_1)*(x_i , k_i)_b^(n_2)(x_j , k_j ) . where the sum is over all fock states with @xmath26 the particle numbers ,",

    "the product is performed over the longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath29 and the transverse momenta @xmath30 .",
    "the light cone wave function @xmath31 is the generalization of distribution amplitude @xmath32 by including the transverse momentum distributions .",
    "this formulation contains both hard and soft interactions .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to develop a non - perturbative light cone approach within the soft collinear effective theory and to evaluate the three universal form factors directly .",
    "the close relation between the light cone qcd and soft collinear effective theory was noted in @xcite .",
    "the scet has the advantage that a systematic power expansion with small parameter @xmath33 ( or @xmath34 ) can be performed to improve the calculation accuracy order by order .",
    "the combination of the two methods can reduce the model dependence of non - perturbative methods . in the conventional light cone",
    "approach , all the quarks are on - shell .",
    "now in the new approach , it is convenient to choose the light energetic quark as the collinear mode in the soft collinear effective theory and the heavy quark field as that in the heavy quark effective theory .",
    "the spectator antiquark is remained as the soft mode . by this way",
