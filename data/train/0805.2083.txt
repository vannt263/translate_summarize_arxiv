    "for an @xmath2 matrix @xmath3 , the expansion of @xmath4@xmath3 via row @xmath5 is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the element of @xmath3 at the intersection of row @xmath5 and column @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the cofactor of @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath9 can be written as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the @xmath12 submatrix of @xmath3 which is obtained by deleting row @xmath5 and column @xmath8 .",
    "thus the probability that @xmath13 undergoes the least change upon perturbation of element @xmath7 is equal to the probability that @xmath14 is as small as possible . as in the earlier paper ,",
    "we treat the following three classes of @xmath12 matrices @xmath11 :    1 .",

    "matrices @xmath24 in which all the diagonal elements are set to 1 and all the off - diagonal elements are as in ( i ) .",
    "thus @xmath25    the matrices @xmath11 described in ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) above will be said to be matrices of type @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "every randomly chosen element of a matrix of any of these types ( i.e. , every element of a matrix of type @xmath28 , every off - diagonal element of a matrix of type @xmath29 or @xmath27 , and the special diagonal element @xmath22 of a matrix of type @xmath29 ) will be called a _",

    "the expansion of the permanent of @xmath50 via the permutation group @xmath56 on the set @xmath57 is @xmath58 since @xmath50 is a binary matrix , every term in this expansion is either 0 or 1 , so the value of @xmath59 is a non - negative integer . in  @xcite , it was shown that the probability that @xmath40 is equal to the probability that @xmath60 , and that @xmath50 has non - zero ( positive ) probability of having permanent @xmath61 if and only if every term in the expansion of @xmath59 via @xmath56 that contains at least one variable element is 0 .",

    "<S> in an earlier paper , we discussed the probability that the determinant of a matrix undergoes the least change upon perturbation of one of its elements , provided that most or all of the elements of the matrix are chosen at random and that the randomly chosen elements have a fixed probability of being non - zero . in this paper , we derive approximate formulas for that probability by assuming that the terms in the permanent of a matrix are independent of one another , and we apply that assumption to several classes of matrices . in the course of deriving those formulas , we identified several integer sequences that are not listed on sloane s web site . </S>"
