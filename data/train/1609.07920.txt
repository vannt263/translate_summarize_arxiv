    "in the recent years , new discoveries have been made at many high energy particle physics laboratories , including the @xmath22 , concerning physics within the boundaries of the standard model and beyond , as the consequence of pushing the maximum energy of the experiments to the new limits .",
    "today , many of these laboratories use parton distribution functions ( @xmath13 ) to describe and analysis their extracted data from the deep inelastic @xmath23 collisions .",
    "these scale - dependent functions are the solutions of the @xmath24-@xmath25-@xmath26-@xmath27-@xmath28 ( @xmath18 ) evolution equations , @xcite , @xmath29 ,      \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 can be either the distribution function of the quarks , @xmath31 , or that of the gluons , @xmath32 , with @xmath33 being the fraction of the longitudinal momentum of the parent hadron ( the @xmath34 variable ) .",
    "the terms on the right - hand side of the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , correspond to the real emission and the virtual contributions , respectively .",
    "the scale @xmath35 is an ultra - violet cutoff , related to the virtuality of the exchanged particle during the deep inelastic scattering ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "@xmath37 are the splitting functions of the respective partons which account for the probability of emerging a parton @xmath38 from a parent parton @xmath39 through @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath18 evolution equation however , is based on the @xmath41 assumption , which systematically neglects the transverse momentum of the emitted partons along the evolution ladder .",
    "it has been repeatedly hinted that undermining the contributions coming from the transverse momentum of the partons may severely harm the precision of the calculations , especially in the high energy processes in the small-@xmath33 region , see for example the references @xcite .",
    "this signaled the necessity of introducing some transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions ( @xmath42 ) , initially trough the @xmath43-@xmath44-@xmath45-@xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) equation @xcite , @xmath48 @xmath49 the @xmath50 implies a physical condition , enforcing the increase of the angle of the emission of the gluons in successive radiations along the evolution chain .",
    "this condition which is usually referred to as the angular ordering constraint ( @xmath51 ) , is due to the coherent radiation of the gluons .",
    "the @xmath52 form factor , @xmath53 , gives the probability of evolving from a scale @xmath54 to a scale @xmath55 , without any partons emission , and can be defined as : @xmath56 with @xmath57 . in the equation ( [ eq2 ] ) , @xmath58 is the double - scaled @xmath47 @xmath59 @xmath13 , which in addition to the @xmath33 and @xmath55 , depends on the transverse momentum of the incoming partons , @xmath8 .",
    "it has been shown ( see the reference @xcite ) that in the proper boundaries , the @xmath47 equation will reduced to the conventional @xmath18 and @xmath60-@xmath61-@xmath62-@xmath26 ( @xmath20 ) equations , @xcite .",
    "the procedure of solving the @xmath47 equation is mathematically involved and unrealistically time consuming , since it includes contemplating iterative integral equations with many terms . on the other hand , the main feature of the @xmath47 equation , i.e. the @xmath51 , can be exclusively used for the gluon evolution and therefore , this process is incapable of producing convincing quark contribution . to overcome these obstacles , martin et",
    "al have introduced the @xmath8-factorization framework and developed the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and the @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) approaches @xcite , both of which are constructed around the @xmath21 @xmath18 evolution equations and modified with the different visualizations of the angular ordering constraint .",
    "the frameworks of @xmath3 and @xmath5 in the @xmath21 and @xmath11 have been investigated intensely in the recent years , see the references @xcite .",
    "although @xmath1 et al have developed the @xmath5 formalism as an improvement to the @xmath3 approach , by correcting the use of the @xmath51 , limiting its effect only on the diagonal splitting functions and extending the range of their calculations into the @xmath11 via introducing the @xmath10 scheme , it appears that the @xmath3 approach , as an effective model , is more successful in producing a realistic theory in order to describe the experiment .",
    "we are therefore eager to expand our investigation regarding the merits and shortcomings of these frameworks into the calculation of the inclusive cross - sections of production of the electro - weak gauge bosons in high energy hadronic collisions .",
    "the process of the production of the massive gauge vector bosons , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , have always been of extreme theoretical and experimental interest , since it can provide invaluable information about the nature of both the electro - weak and the strong interactions , setting a benchmark for testing the validity of the experiments and establishing a firm base for testing new theoretical frameworks , see the references @xcite .",
    "it is not however straightforward to describe the transverse momentum distributions of the electro - weak bosons produced in hadron - hadron collisions , since the usual collinear factorization approach in the @xmath21 , neglects the transverse momentum dependency of the incoming partons and therefore predicts a vanishing transverse momentum for the product .",
    "consequently , initial - state @xmath23 radiation is necessary to generate the @xmath8 distributions . on the other hand , in this approximation",
    ", calculations for differential cross sections of the @xmath63 and @xmath64 production diverge logarithmically in the @xmath11 limit for the @xmath65 ( which is the main region of interest ) , due to the soft gluon emission .",
    "so , one requires a re - summation to obtain a finite @xmath8 distribution .    in the present work",
    "we tend to calculate the @xmath8 distributions of the cross - section of production of the @xmath63 and @xmath64 using the @xmath11 level diagrams and the @xmath21 and @xmath11 @xmath7 of the @xmath3 and the @xmath5 frameworks .",
    "the @xmath7 will be prepared in their proper @xmath8-factorization schemes using the @xmath13 of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xcite .",
    "such calculations have been previously carried out using @xmath21 matrix elements of quark - antiquark annihilation cross section and doubly - unintegrated parton distribution functions ( @xmath66 ) in the framework of @xmath67-factorization , reference @xcite , and in a semi-@xmath11 approach , using a mixture of @xmath21 and @xmath11 matrix elements for the involved processes in addition to a variety of @xmath59 @xmath13 , see the reference @xcite .",
    "to improve these approximations and at the same time , test the functionality of the @xmath3 and the @xmath5 @xmath7 , we have calculated the @xmath11 ladder diagrams for @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , utilizing a physical gauge for the gluons . in this way , at the price performing long and complicated calculations , we will demonstrate that with the use of the @xmath7 in the @xmath11 calculations , one can extract an excellent description of the experimental data of the @xmath71 [ 5,8,9 ] and @xmath72 [ 4 ] collaborations , as well as others works given here , regarding the transverse momentum distributions of the @xmath63 and @xmath64 boson .",
    "in what follows , first , a brief introduction to the concept of @xmath8-factorization will be presented and the respective formalisms for the @xmath3 and the @xmath5 frameworks will be derived , in the section 2 . the section 3 contains a comprehensive description over the utilities and means for the calculation of the @xmath8-dependent cross - section of production of the @xmath63 and @xmath64 gauge vector bosons in a hadron - hadron ( or hadron - antihadron ) deep inelastic collision .",
    "the necessary numerical analysis will be presented in the section 4 , after which a thoroughgoing conclusion will be followed in the section 5 .",
    "a parton entering the sub - process at the top of the evolution ladder , has non - negligible transverse momentum .",
    "however , it is customary to use the @xmath13 of the @xmath18 or the @xmath20 evolution equations to describe such partons , despite the fact that these density functions intrinsically carry no @xmath8-dependency . to include the contributions coming from the transverse momentum distributions of the partons",
    ", one can either use the solutions of the @xmath47 evolution equation or unify the @xmath20 and the @xmath18 evolution equations to form a properly tuned @xmath8-dependent framework , @xcite . nevertheless , given the mathematical complexity of these schemes ,",
    "it is not desirable to use them in the task of computing the @xmath36 cross - sections .",
    "another way is to convolute the single - scaled solutions of the @xmath18 evolution equation and insert the required @xmath8-dependency via the process of @xmath8-factorization ( for a complete description see the reference @xcite ) .",
    "thus , one may define the @xmath7 , @xmath73 , in the @xmath8-factorization scheme , through the following normalization relation , @xmath74 where @xmath75 are the solutions of the @xmath18 equation and stand for either @xmath76 or @xmath77 .",
    "the procedure of deriving a direct expansion for @xmath73 , in terms of the @xmath13 is strait forward . yet , exposing the resulting prescriptions to the different visualizations of the @xmath51 will produce different @xmath7 , namely the @xmath3 , the @xmath9 and the @xmath10 frameworks . in what follows , we will describe these frameworks in detail .",
    "starting form the @xmath18 equation in the leading order , the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , and using the unregulated @xmath21 @xmath18 splitting kernels , @xmath37 , the reference @xcite , @xmath0 et al introduced an infrared cut - off , @xmath78 , as a visualization of the @xmath51 @xcite , @xmath79 limiting the upper boundary on @xmath80 integration by @xmath78 , excludes @xmath81 form the integral equation and automatically prevents facing the soft gluon singularities arising form the @xmath82 terms in the splitting functions .",
    "additionally , they factorized the virtual contributions from the @xmath18 equations , by defining a virtual ( loop ) contributions as : @xmath83 with @xmath84 as an appropriated form of the @xmath52 form factor , the equation ( [ eq3 ] ) . afterwards , the double - scaled @xmath3 @xmath7 are defined as follows : @xmath85 .",

    "the required @xmath13 is provided as input , using the libraries @xmath87 @xcite and @xmath88 @xcite , where the calculation of the single - scaled functions have been carried out using the @xmath36 data on the @xmath89 structure function of the proton .",
    "@xmath90 are considered to be unity for @xmath91 .",
    "this constraint and its interpretation in terms of the strong ordering condition gives the @xmath3 approach a smooth behavior over the small-@xmath33 region , which is generally governed by the @xmath20 evolution equation .      in coordination with the theory of gluonic coherent radiation ,",
    "it has been pointed out that the @xmath51 in the @xmath3 formalism should only act on the terms including the on - shell gluon emissions , i.e. the diagonal splitting functions @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",

    "the @xmath7 of @xmath3 and @xmath5 to a good approximation , include the main kinematical effects involved in the @xmath36 processes .",
    "one should note that the particular form of the @xmath51 in the @xmath3 formalism despite being of the @xmath21 , includes some contributions from the @xmath11 sector , whence in the case of @xmath5 framework , these contributions must be inserted separately .",
    "the expansions of the @xmath21 @xmath5 formalism into the @xmath11 region can be achieved through the following definitions : @xmath101 @xmath102 with the @xmath11 splitting functions being defined as , @xmath103 and @xmath104 where @xmath105 stand for @xmath21 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "the reader can find a comprehensive description of the @xmath11 splitting functions in the references @xcite .",
    "we must however emphasis that contrary to the @xmath3 and the @xmath21 @xmath5 frameworks , the @xmath51 is being introduced into the @xmath11 @xmath5 formalism via the @xmath106 constraint , in the `` extended '' splitting function .",
    "now @xmath78 can be defined as : @xmath107 the @xmath11 corrections introduced into this framework are the collection of the @xmath11 @xmath13 , the @xmath11 splitting functions and the constraint @xmath108 .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown that using only the @xmath21 part of the extended splitting function , instead of the complete definition of equation ( [ eq12 ] ) , would result in reasonable accuracy in computation of the @xmath11 @xmath5 @xmath7 @xcite . additionally , the @xmath52 form factors in this framework are defined as : @xmath109 \\right ) ,      \\label{eq14}\\ ] ] @xmath110 \\right ) .",

    ", we will describe the cross - section of the production of the @xmath63 and @xmath64 bosons with the help of our @xmath7 .",
    "by definition , the total cross - section for a deep hadronic collision , @xmath111 , can be written in terms of its possible partonic constituents . utilizing the @xmath7 as density functions for the involved partons , one may write @xmath111 in the following form : @xmath112 @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the incoming partons into the semi - hard process from the first and the second hadrons , respectively .",
    "@xmath116 are the corresponding partonic cross - sections which can be defined separately as , @xmath117 @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the multi - particle phase space and the flux factor , respectively and can be defined according to the specifications of the partonic process , @xmath120 @xmath121 with the @xmath122 being the center of mass energy squared .",
    "@xmath123 @xmath124 and @xmath125 are the 4-momenta of the incoming protons and since we are working in the infinite momentum frame , it is safe to neglect their masses .",
    "@xmath118 can be characterized in terms of transverse momenta of the product particles , @xmath126 , their rapidities , @xmath127 , and the azimuthal angles of the emissions , @xmath128 , @xmath129    in the equation ( [ eq17 ] ) , @xmath130 are the matrix elements of the partonic diagrams which are involved in the production of the final results . to calculate these quantities",
    ", one must first understand the exact kinematics that rule over the corresponding partonic processes .",
    "the figure [ fig1 ] illustrates the ladder - type @xmath11 diagrams that one have to consider , counting the contributions coming from @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 as shown in the figure [ fig1 ] , panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively . the kinematics and calculations of this type of invariant amplitudes have been discussed extensively in the references @xcite .",
    "we have followed the same approach , obtaining the @xmath134 terms only from the ladder - type diagrams , and not from the interference ( i.e. the non - ladder ) diagrams , using a physical gauge for the gluons , where only the two transverse polarizations propagate , @xmath135 @xmath136 is the gauge - fixing vector .",
    "choosing such a gauge condition , ensures that the @xmath134 terms are being obtained from the ladder - type diagrams on both sides of the sub - processes . in the case of hadron - hadron collisions",
    ", one might expect that neglecting the contributions coming from the non - ladder diagrams , i.e. the diagrams where the production of the electro - weak bosons is a by - product of the hadronic collision ( see the reference @xcite ) , would have a numerical effect on the results .",
    "nevertheless , employing the gauge choice ( [ eq21 ] ) , one finds out that the contribution from the `` unfactorizable '' non - ladder diagrams vanishes .    in the proton - antiproton center of mass frame , we can write the following kinematics @xmath137 @xmath138 where the @xmath139 are the 4-momenta of the partons that enter the semi - hard process . afterwards , it is possible to write the law of the transverse momentum conservation for the partonic process : @xmath140 with @xmath141 being the transverse momentum of the produced vector boson . additionally ,",
    "defining the transverse mass of the produced virtual partons , @xmath142 , we can write , @xmath143 @xmath144 now , using the above equations , one can derive the following equation for the total cross - section of the production of the @xmath63 and @xmath64 bosons in the framework of @xmath8-factorization , @xmath145 @xmath146 @xmath147 note that the integration boundaries for @xmath148 are @xmath149 .",
    "one may introduce an upper limit for these , say @xmath150 , several times larger than the scale @xmath86 , without any noticeable consequences .",
    "yet , for @xmath151 with @xmath152 , i.e. for the non - perturbative region , it is impervious to decide how to validate our @xmath7 . a natural choice would be to fulfill the requirement that @xmath153 and therefore , we can safely choose the following approximation for the non - perturbative region : @xmath154    in the next section , we will introduce some of the numerical methods that have been used for the calculation of the @xmath155 , the equation ( [ eq25 ] ) , using the @xmath7 of @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "it it expected that through considering @xmath11 processes for this computation , the results will have a better agreement with the existing experimental data , in comparison with the previous calculations .",
    "the main challenge one must face , in the computions of the total cross - section of a hadron - hadron collision in the @xmath11 , is the extremely complex calculations required for extracting the invariant amplitudes in a set of @xmath156 @xmath11 feynman diagrams .",
    "each of our processes , @xmath68 , @xmath157 , and @xmath70 , include a number of different configurations , see the figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "this is when we filter out the non - ladder diagrams , with our choice of the gauge condition on the gluon polarization , the equation ( [ eq21 ] ) .",
    "writing the analytic expressions of the @xmath158 for theses diagrams is rather straight forward , see the appendix a.    however , since the incoming and the out - going quarks are off - shell , and we do not neglect their transverse momenta , their on - shell spin density matrices has to be replaced with a more complicated expression . to do this , one can extend the original expressions , according to an approximation proposed in the references @xcite , through converting the off - shell quark lines to the internal lines via replacing the spinorial elements of the incoming and the out - going partons .",
    "following this idea , we replace the incoming proton with a quark with the momentum @xmath159 and the mass @xmath160 which radiates a photon or a gluon and turns into an off - shell quark with the momentum @xmath161 .",
    "therefore , the corresponding matrix element for such quarks can be written as , @xmath162 where @xmath163 represents the rest of the original matrix element .",
    "now , the expression presented between @xmath163 and @xmath164 is considered to be the off - shell quark spin density matrix . using the on - shell identity @xmath165 and after performing some dirac algebra at the @xmath166 limit , one simply arrives to the following expression : @xmath167 \\ ;      \\gamma^{\\mu } \\right).\\ ] ] afterwards , imposing the sudakov decomposition @xmath168 with @xmath169 , one derives : @xmath170 thus , with the above replacement , the negative light - cone momentum fractions of the incoming partons have been neglected .",
    "@xmath171 in this equation represents the properly normalized off - shell spin density matrix .",
    "additionally , the coupling vertices of the off - shell gluons to quarks must be modified with the eikonal vertex ( i.e the @xmath20 prescription , see the reference @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , in the case of initial off - shell gluons , we impose the so - called non - sense polarization condition , i.e. @xmath172 which results into the following normalization identity @xmath173 we can calculate the evolution of the traces of the matrix elements with the help of the algebraic manipulation system @xmath174 , @xcite .",
    "also , the method of orthogonal amplitudes , see the reference @xcite , can be used to further simplify the results .",
    "the numerical computation of the equation ( [ eq25 ] ) have been carried out using the @xmath175 algorithm in the monte - carlo integration .",
    "to do this , we have selected the hard - scale of the @xmath7 to be equal to the transverse mass of the produced gauge vector boson : @xmath176 mathematically speaking , the upper bound on the transverse momentum integrations of the master equation ( 25 ) should be the infinity .",
    "however , since the @xmath7 of @xmath3 and @xmath5 tend to quickly vanish in the @xmath177 domain , one can safely introduce an ultraviolet cut - off for these integrations . by convention , this cut - off",
    "is considered to be at @xmath178 .",
    "nevertheless , given that @xmath86 depends on the transverse momentum of the produced boson ( @xmath179 ) and its mass , it would be sufficient to set @xmath180 , with @xmath181 one can easily confirm that further domain have no contribution into our results . also it is satisfactory to bound the rapidity integrations to @xmath182 $ ] , since @xmath183 and according to the equation ( [ eq24 ] ) , further domain has no contribution into our results .",
    "the choice of above hard scale is reasonable for the production of w and z bosons , as has been discussed in the reference @xcite .    as a final note ,",
    "we should make it clear that in the reference @xcite , the calculation of the transverse momentum distribution for the production of the @xmath184 and @xmath185 bosons has been carried out , using the aggregated contributions of the following sub - processes :    * the @xmath11 @xmath186 partonic process , using the unintegrated gluon distributions of the @xmath47 and the @xmath21 @xmath5 formalisms , accounting for the production of the bosons accompanied by ( at least ) two distinct jets .",
    "* the @xmath21 @xmath187 partonic process , with the density function of the incoming quarks and gluons being defined in the collinear ( @xmath188 or @xmath189 ) and the @xmath8-factorization ( the @xmath47 and the @xmath21 @xmath5 ) formalisms , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to the @xmath190 cross - section . * the @xmath21 @xmath191 partonic process , from the collinear approximation , assuming that the incoming particles are valance quarks ( or valance anti - quarks ) .",
    "the above paratonic processes ( a , b and c ) obviously neglect some of the @xmath11 contributions ( in the b and c cases ) , namely the shares of the non - valance quarks along the chain of evolution . additionally , assuming the non - zero transverse momentum for the valance quarks in the infinite momentum frame is to some extent unacceptable , since , in the absence of any extra structure , the intrinsic transverse momenta of the valance quarks should not be enough for producing the @xmath192 bosons with relatively large @xmath193 . in the present work ,",
    "we have upgraded the partonic processes of the b and c cases with their nlo counterparts , i.e. @xmath194 and @xmath195 sub - processes .",
    "so , we are able to use the updf of the @xmath8-factorization for the incoming quarks and gluons to insert the transverse momentum dependency of the produced bosons , and at the same time avoid over - counting . furthermore , the problem of separating the @xmath192+single - jet and the @xmath192+double - jet cross - sections will reduce to inserting the correct physical constraints on the dynamics of these processes , e.g. via inserting some transverse momentum cuts for the produced jets , using the anti-@xmath8 algorithm , see the reference @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , since we are interested to calculate the inclusive cross - section for the production of the @xmath192 bosons , inserting such constraints is unnecessary .",
    "using the theory and the notions of the previous sections , one can calculate the production rate of the @xmath63 and @xmath64 gauge vector bosons for the center - of - mass energy of @xmath196 @xmath197 .",
    "the @xmath13 of martin et al @xcite , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , are used as the input functions to feed the equations ( [ eq6 ] ) , ( [ eq7 ] ) , ( [ eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "the results are the double - scale @xmath7 in the @xmath3 , the @xmath198 and the @xmath199 schemes .",
    "these @xmath7 are in turn substituted into the equation ( [ eq25 ] ) to construct the @xmath192 cross - sections in their respective frameworks .",
    "since we intend to compare our calculations to the @xmath200 and @xmath201 decays , we should multiply our theoretical out - put by the relevant branching fractions , i.e. @xmath202 and @xmath203 @xcite .",
    "thus , the figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] present the reader , with a comparison between the different contributions into the differential cross - sections of the @xmath63 and @xmath64 , versus their transverse momentum ( @xmath8 ) in the @xmath3 scheme .",
    "the main contributions into the production of the @xmath63 are those involving @xmath204 and @xmath205 vertices .",
    "other production vertices have been calculated and proven to be negligible compared to these main contributions ( nevertheless , for the sake of completeness , we have included every single share , no matter how small they are in the total contributions , see the figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , where the individual contributions of each of the production vertices in the partonic sub - processes for the production of @xmath63 and @xmath64 have been depicted clearly , in the framework of @xmath3 for @xmath206 ) . in the case of @xmath64 production ,",
    "the main vertices are @xmath207 , @xmath208 , @xmath209 and @xmath210 . in both cases",
    ", one can recognize the different behavior of various partonic sub - processes .",
    "as expected , the contributions of the @xmath211 in all of the diagrams are similar , and even ( roughly ) of the same size , since they only depend on the behavior of the gluon density . on the other hand ,",
    "the contribution coming from the @xmath212 differs from one production vertex to another , mimicking the differences between the quark densities of different flavors and going from the high contributions of the up and down quarks to small contributions of the charm and strange and even negligible contributions of the top and bottom quarks .",
    "additionally , one notices the smallness of the @xmath213 contributions .",
    "this is also anticipated , since the incoming gluon could ( with a relatively large probability ) decay into a quark - antiquark pair that does not have the right flavor to form a production vertex with considerable contribution .",
    "the figures [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] illustrate a complete comparison between the results of the calculation of the production of the electro - weak gauge vector bosons in the frameworks of @xmath3 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 , with each other and with the experimental data of the @xmath71 and @xmath72 collaborations , references @xcite .",
    "the results in the @xmath3 framework has an excellent agreement with the experimental data , both in the @xmath63 and @xmath64 productions .",
    "the @xmath198 scheme behaves similarly compared to the @xmath3 framework , yet has a noticeably shorter peak , specially in the case of @xmath64 .",
    "this is due the different visualization of the @xmath51 between these two frameworks , see the section 3 .",
    "meanwhile , the results in the @xmath214 scheme are unexpectedly unable to describe the experiment data .",
    "this is related to the conditions in which the @xmath51 has been imposed in this framework .",
    "the @xmath215 constraint gives the parton distributions of the @xmath199 , a sharp descend to zero at @xmath216 and returns a vanishing contribution for the better part of the transverse momentum integration in the equation ( [ eq25 ] ) .",
    "consequently , the overall value of the differential cross - sections of the @xmath63 and @xmath64 production in this framework reduces dramatically , as it is apparent in the figures [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] . in overall and as it has been stated elsewhere ( see for example the references @xcite ) the results in the @xmath3 scheme seemingly have a better agreement with the experiment .",
    "this is to some extend ironic , since the @xmath21 and the @xmath199 formalisms are developed as extensions and improvements to the @xmath3 approach and are more compatible with the @xmath18 evolution equation .",
    "such comparisons can also be made for the larger values of @xmath8 , see the figures [ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] , where the production rates of the electro - weak gauge bosons are plotted against their transverse momentum for @xmath217 .",
    "the diagrams include the calculations of @xmath218 and @xmath219 and the comparisons are made with the help of the data from the @xmath71 collaboration , references @xcite .",
    "of course , since the data points have small values and large errors , and because of the closeness of the results in different frameworks , one can not stress over the superiority of any of the approaches . yet , our previous conclusion about the validity of the @xmath3 @xmath7 and the short - comings of the @xmath214 @xmath7 holds .",
    "another interesting observation is that in the large @xmath8 , where because of the smallness of the results the higher order corrections become important , the calculations in the @xmath3 approach start to separate from the @xmath198 and behave similar to the @xmath199 .",
    "the reason is that the inclusion of the @xmath220 splitting functions into the domain of the @xmath51 introduces some corrections from the @xmath11 region .",
    "additionally , one notices that the contribution coming from the @xmath221 in the @xmath11 evaluations considerably deviates from the similar behavior of its respective counterparts .",
    "this of course roots in the evolution of the @xmath11 quark densities in this framework , see the reference @xcite    recently , martin et al have updated their @xmath13 libraries , the reference @xcite .",
    "the figures [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] demonstrate the differences between the cross - section of the production of the @xmath192 vector bosons in the @xmath3 framework , using the ( older ) @xmath87 and the ( newer ) @xmath88 @xmath13 .",
    "one notices that , using either of these @xmath13 as input for our @xmath7 produces a negligible difference .",
    "the figures [ fig13 ] and [ fig14 ] present an interesting comparison between the experimental data and the results of the different approximations in the calculation of the production of the electro - weak gauge vector bosons .",
    "in addition to our calculations in the @xmath3 and the @xmath5 @xmath7 in the @xmath21 and the @xmath11 approximations , the results coming from the @xmath47 @xmath59 @xmath13 ( reference @xcite ) , the @xmath222 @xmath6 parton distributions ( @xmath66 , see the reference @xcite ) and from the @xmath223 frameworks are included in these diagrams .",
    "the @xmath47 results are calculated as the sum of @xmath224 , @xmath225 and @xmath226 sub - processes .",
    "the @xmath66 results are in the @xmath227-factorization framework , utilizing a @xmath226 `` effective '' production vertex . furthermore , to calculate the differential cross - section of the @xmath192 production in the @xmath223 approximation , one have to ignore the transverse momentum integrations in the equation ( [ eq25 ] ) and replace the @xmath7 with the unpolarized parton distributions of @xmath87 , @xmath88 or @xmath228 @xcite : @xmath229 @xmath230    the reader should notice that the results of our computations in the @xmath11 regime , as expected , have a better behavior towards describing the experimental data , both in the @xmath63 and @xmath64 cases , since they descend with a shallow steep , compared to the results calculated in other schemes .",
    "this is in part , because the @xmath11 evaluations are inherently more accurate . yet",
    ", most of the credit goes to the precision of the utilized @xmath7 .",
    "again , the @xmath3 framework in the @xmath11 calculations offers the best description of the experiment .    additionally , it is possible to compare our presumed frameworks through the calculation of the total cross - section of the @xmath63 and @xmath64 production with respect to the center - of - mass energy of the hadronic collision , i.e. the figures [ fig15 ] and [ fig16 ] .",
    "following our previous pattern , the results of both the @xmath3 and the @xmath198 frameworks show a good level of compatibility with the experimental data . on the other hand , since the @xmath199 framework has failed to describe the data , we have excluded its contributions here , to save some computation time .",
    "finally , it has been brought to our attention that the @xmath231 and @xmath232 collaborations have recently published some data regarding the production of the @xmath64 gauge vector boson in the @xmath22 for @xmath233 , the references @xcite . in the above calculations ,",
    "the rapidity of the produced boson has been separated in equally spaced rapidity sectors within @xmath234 domain . in figure",
    "[ fig17 ] , we have addressed the above observations , using our @xmath11 framework and utilizing the @xmath7 of @xmath3 , since we have already established the superiority of this scheme in describing the experiment .",
    "the individual contributions from the partonic sub - processes are presented and the total values of ( single and double ) differential cross - sections are subjected to comparison with the data of the @xmath231 and @xmath232 collaborations .",
    "one easily notes that our calculations is in general agreement with the experimental data and with similar calculations in a @xmath235 @xmath23 framework from the reference @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , performing these calculations are extremely time - consuming and the existing data points are not plentiful or accurate enough to let us make a decisive statement about the superiority regarding any of our presumed frameworks .",
    "nevertheless , considering these comparisons , it is apparent that the @xmath3 @xmath7 in the framework of @xmath8-factorization , despite their miss - alignments with the theory of the @xmath18 evolution equation and the physics of the successive gluon radiations , as an effective theory , proposes the best option to describe the deep inelastic @xmath23 events .",
    "however , until further phenomenological analysis , such claim remains as an educated speculation .    in summary , within the present work",
    ", we have calculated the rate of productions belonging to the electro - weak gauge vector bosons in the framework of @xmath8-factorization , utilizing the @xmath7 of @xmath3 , @xmath236 and @xmath199 , by the means of @xmath11 @xmath23 processes .",
    "the results have been demonstrated and compared to each other and to the experimental data points from the @xmath71 and the @xmath72 collaborations , as well as the calculations in other frameworks . through our analysis we have suggested that despite the theoretical advantages of the @xmath5 formalism , the @xmath3 approach has a better behavior toward describing the experiment .",
    "@xmath237 would like to acknowledge the research council of university of tehran and the institute for research and planning in higher education for the grants provided for him .",
