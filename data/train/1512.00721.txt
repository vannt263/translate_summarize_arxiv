    "in his work , we extend the split - step backward - euler method introduced in @xcite to numerically solve stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) driven by brownian motion to the setting of sdes driven by poisson random measures @xcite .",

    "srns are employed to describe the time evolution of biochemical reactions , epidemic processes @xcite , and transcription and translation in genomics and virus kinetics @xcite , among other important applications .",

    "we aim to provide accurate estimations of the expected value , @xmath4}$ ] , where @xmath5 is a given smooth scalar observable of @xmath0 .",
    "many methods have been developed to simulate exact sample paths of srns ; for instance , the stochastic simulation algorithm ( ssa ) was introduced by gillespie in @xcite and the modified next reaction method ( mnrm ) was proposed by anderson in @xcite .",
    "it is well known that pathwise exact realizations of srns may be computationally very costly when some reaction channels have high reaction rates . to overcome this issue , gillespie @xcite and aparicio and solari @xcite independently proposed the explicit tau - leap ( tl ) method ( see section [ sec : exp_tau ] ) to simulate approximate paths of @xmath0 by evolving the process with fixed time steps , keeping the reaction rates fixed within each time step .    in this work ,",
    "we address the problem of producing approximate - path simulations of srns for cases in which the set of reaction channels can be clearly classified into two subsets : fast and slow reaction channels ( in the literature , this type of problem is called a _ stiff problem _",
    "@xcite ) . in this context",
    ", the method is hardly adequate because the time step required to maintain the numerical stability can be very small @xcite and , as a consequence , simulating paths of process @xmath0 may become computationally expensive . for this purpose , different implicit schemes have been suggested , in particular , the drift - implicit tau - leap @xcite , which uses an implicit discretization for the drift , together with an explicit discretization of the poissonian noise . our split - step implicit tau - leap ( ) , method naturally produces values in the lattice , . hence , there is no need for an additional rounding step as in @xcite ( see section [ sec : imp_tau ] ) .",
    "other simulation schemes have been proposed to deal with situations with well - separated fast and slow timescales .",
    "cao and petzold @xcite proposed a trapezoidal implicit tau - leap formula that is similar to the trapezoidal rule for solving ordinary differential equations ( odes ) .",
    "the trapezoidal implicit tau - leap scheme is numerically stable and does not possess the damping effect present in the drift - implicit tau - leap ( section 3 in @xcite gives details on the damping effect ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors focus on the stability properties of a trapezoidal implicit tau - leap scheme .",
    "they provide a posteriori comparisons of moments of order one and two with the ssa , the and the drift - implicit tau - leap methods . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no multilevel version of the trapezoidal tau - leap has been proposed . in @xcite ,",
    "ahn et al .",
    "developed fully implicit tau - leap schemes that implicitly treat both the drift and the noise of the poisson variables .",
    "the construction of fully implicit tau - leap schemes is based on adapting weakly convergent discretizations of stochastic differential equations @xcite to stochastic chemical kinetic systems .",
    "constructing a multilevel version of the fully implicit tau - leap is still under investigation since it may involve a more complicated way of coupling two consecutive paths than does the presented here . in the same context ,",
    "rathinam et al .",
    "@xcite developed an explicit method that addresses stiffness in small number systems .",
    "the reversible - equivalent - monomolecular tau method ( remm-@xmath6 ) consists of decomposing the system into reversible pairs of reactions and approximating bimolecular reversible pairs by suitable monomolecular reversible pairs . updating the state of the system involves the use of both binomial and poisson random variables .",
    "the authors in @xcite showed that remm-@xmath6 performs better than the drift - implicit @xcite and the trapezoidal implicit @xcite tau - leap methods for small number stiff problems , since it avoids the need for an additional rounding step required in the latter methods .",
    "howerver , remm-@xmath6 does not have a natural multilevel monte carlo ( mlmc ) version ( see section [ coupling partial implicit tau - leap paths ] ) .",
    "another type of explicit method that addresses stiffness was developed in @xcite by abdulle et al .",
    "they proposed @xmath6-rock ( orthogonal runge - kutta chebyshev ) as an extension of the multi - stage s - rock methods @xcite for discrete stochastic processes and they derived schemes for processes with discrete poisson noise .",
    "this method can have comparable stability properties to the implicit method while remaining explicit .",
    "the stability properties of @xmath6-rock can be controlled by increasing the tuning parameter , which is the stage number .",
    "although the @xmath6-rock method has the advantage of avoiding the cost of solving nonlinear problems involved in , another cost is included that is related to the selection procedure for the optimal number of stages to obtain a desired stability domain . in @xcite ,",
    "abdulle et al . did not provide an explicit comparison between @xmath6-rock and drift - implicit tau - leap in terms of computational time and error control .",
    "furthermore , to the best of our knowledge , no multilevel version of @xmath6-rock has been developed for srns .",
    "the multilevel estimator proposed here is based on the split - step implicit tau - leap ( ) rather than on @xmath6-rock for two reasons :",
    "the first is that coupling two consecutive paths is simpler in the case of the than in the case of the one based on @xmath6-rock , which is currently under investigation ; the second is that simulating single paths with is more computationally efficient than with @xmath6-rock , especially in the case of large time steps ( see section [ sec : examples ] ) . finally , we mention the so - called _ integral tau methods _ proposed in @xcite , in which the authors developed two variants of tau - leap methods that are adapted to stiff problems , produce nonnegative and lattice valued solutions , and converge to the implicit euler solution in the fluid limit .",
    "this is achieved in two steps : i ) a deterministic implicit step that computes the drift update , and ii ) a stochastic step based on the search for a set of feasible reaction counts that adds a linear combination of independent binomial and poisson random variables .",
    "nevertheless , those methods can not be naturally extended to the mlmc paradigm .",
    "we mention a few works on error analysis and convergence in implicit tau - leap schemes @xcite . in @xcite , rathinam",
    "showed that both the explicit and the implicit tau - leap methods are first - order convergent in all moments under the assumptions of bounded state space and linear propensity functions .",
    "this result was generalized for nonlinear propensity functions in @xcite but only specifically for the method .",
    "this type of method has @xmath7 order of convergence in a strong sense .",
    "discussions of the two existing scalings for the convergence analysis of tau - leap methods can be found in @xcite .",
    "more general results for the weak convergence were established in @xcite for unbounded systems that possess certain moment growth bounds .",
    "rathinam @xcite showed that the main convergence result applies to any tau - leap method provided that it produces integer - valued states and satisfies some condition related to the moments , particularly implicit methods .    inspired by the work of anderson and higham @xcite",
    ", we extend the idea to the multilevel setting by introducing a multilevel hybrid estimator ( see section [ sec : multilevel drift - implicit tau - leap ] ) with the aim of reducing the computational work needed to compute an estimate of @xmath4}$ ] within a fixed tolerance , @xmath8 , with a given level of confidence , and for a class of systems characterized by having simultaneously fast and slow time scales .",
    "our mlmc strategy couples two paths at the coarser levels of discretization until a certain interface level , @xmath9 , where we start coupling paths using the method as indicated in @xcite . in that sense",
    ", our strategy can be considered to be a hybrid algorithm .",
    "this strategy is specially relevant when @xmath8 is small , implying that the finest level of the multilevel , @xmath10 , is in the stability regime of the multilevel . for large values of @xmath8 ,",
    "our mlmc estimator reduces to a multilevel estimator .    as noted above",
    ", this extension is relevant to systems with slow and fast timescales ( see section [ sec : examples ] for numerical examples ) . in such situations ,",
    "the multilevel estimator given in @xcite is not computationally efficient due to the numerical stability constraint . in section",
    "[ sec : examples ] , we show that the multilevel method has the same order of computational complexity as the multilevel , which is of @xmath11 @xcite , but with a smaller multiplicative constant . we note that here our goal is to provide an estimate of @xmath4}$ ] in the probability sense and not in the mean - square sense as in @xcite .",
    "recently , adaptive multilevel estimators were proposed to improve the performance of non - adaptive estimators @xcite to simulate srns with markedly different timescales . in @xcite , moraes et al .",
    "presented an adaptive mlmc method that uses a low - cost , reaction - splitting heuristic to adaptively classify the set of reaction channels into two subsets , fast and slow , in terms of level of activity .",
    "based on their adaptive reaction - splitting technique and using a hierarchy of non - nested time meshes , they simulate the increments associated with high activity channels ( fast reactions ) using the method while those associated with low activity channels ( slow reactions ) are simulated using an exact method .",
    "lester et al .",
    "@xcite proposed an adaptive mlmc method strongly influenced by @xcite that uses a time - stepping strategy based on the concept of _ the leap condition _ introduced in @xcite .",
    "the idea of adaptivity provides possibilities for future research directions , for instance developing efficient , adaptive , hybrid multilevel estimators that would allow us to switch between using , and exact ssa within the course of a single sample path .",
    "the outline of the remainder of this work is as follows : in section [ sec : singlelevel ] , we introduce the mathematical model of srns and give the necessary elements to simulate single - level paths in the context of srns . in section [ sec : multilevel drift - implicit tau - leap ] , we introduce our multilevel hybrid estimator .",
    "first , we review the mlmc method and then we show how to couple paths and also a path with another path simulated by the method .",
    "this coupling procedure is the main building block for constructing the new mlmc estimator .",
    "this section ends with a presentation of the implementation details of the proposed estimator , which involves the procedure to select the levels and number of simulations per level and the switching rule from coupled to . in section [ sec : examples ] , we present some numerical experiments illustrating the performance of the proposed method . finally , in section [ conclusions ] , we offer conclusions and suggest directions for future work .",

    "we are interested in the time evolution of a homogeneously mixed chemical reacting system described by the markovian pure jump process , @xmath12\\times \\omega \\to{\\mathbb{z}}_+^d$ ] , where ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) is a probability space . in this framework",
