    "the low - density wavefront corresponds to larger distances from the initial boundary , so the product of the density and the distance around the wavefront leads to higher uncertainties in the averaged velocity .     and",
    "( b ) two - leg snnn lattice where a flat band emerges from the overlapping of energy bands when the tunneling coefficients are uniform.,width=326 ]    we have two remarks .",
    "our initial condition corresponds to a band insulator on the left half lattice .",
    "it has been shown that reducing the initial filling only reduces the magnitude of the current and the dynamics remains similar @xcite .",
    "one may use an initial configuration with finite total momentum , which may be realizable by filling up fermions in selected momentum states or imposing a momentum transfer . since the spectral weight of the states",
    "are determined by the initial condition , the propagation will be biased towards the selected initial momentum .",
    "the maximal propagating speed , however , is determined by the lattice geometry and will not be changed by different initial states . here",
    "we focus on fermionic transport because it has been shown that noninteracting bosons in the ground state will form a macroscopically coherent condensate and the transport is highly oscillatory @xcite .",
    "in addition , at low temperature bosons stay in the bottom of energy bands , so they are insensitive to flat - bands which are at higher energies . for the purpose of probing the maximal propagating speed and flat - band physics ,",
    "fermions are then a better choice .",
    "the honeycomb lattice , when the zig - zag side is placed along the horizontal direction , can be viewed as a deformed square lattice with alternating missing vertical links . in this case , the wavefront propagation velocity from the band theory and simulations are both identical to that of the square lattice when geometrical factors are properly considered .",
    "it is known that the low - energy dispersion in the honeycomb lattice around the dirac points resembles relativistic fermions @xcite . for global transport studied here , the low - energy effects are not observable .",
    "we now turn to the reason behind the density jump of the two - leg snnn lattice observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] .",
    "when @xmath38 , the hamiltonian can also be diagonalized and the energy bands are @xmath62 the two bands are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energybands](b ) .",
    "one important feature is that there is a flat band , i.e. , a collection of dispersionless states .",
    "the particles on the flat band have localized spatial patterns so they do not participate in transport directly .",
    "for the two - leg snnn lattice , the flat - band state corresponds to the wavefunction @xmath63 localized on a vertical link .",
    "the tunneling from the two sites on a verticle link to any site to the left or to the right leads to a total destructive interference , which explains the localization .",
    "this also contrasts why @xmath64 is special for the snnn lattice because no such total desctructive interference can be found in other values of @xmath65 . in the presence of a chemical potential difference caused by the initial density difference , mobile atoms on the curved part of the dispersions are driven to the initial vacuum region .",
    "the atoms on the flat - band , in contrast , remain in the initially filled region because their wave functions tend to localize .",
    "since each momentum state can accommodate one fermion , in fig .",
    "[ fig : energybands](b ) the flat - band contains exactly @xmath13 states",
    ". thus , the flat - band states account for half of the total states ( i.e. , @xmath13 out of the total @xmath66 states ) .",
    "therefore , the static property of the localized flat - band states is the reason for the density jump . by inspecting the particle density profiles at different time slots",
    ", we have verified that the density jump does not decrease significantly as the wavefront propagates to the right .",
    "we also remark that , because fermions pile up from the lowest energy to the fermi energy , the lower part of the dispersive band will be populated first .",
    "there are @xmath67 states on the dispersive band below the energy of the flat - band as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energybands](b ) .",
    "thus , to observe the density discontinuity the initial filling on the left half lattice should exceed @xmath68 for the flat - band to be filled .",
    "this analysis again shows the power of band theory in explaining transport properties .",
    "such a flat - band induced dynamical density discontinuity may be generic in cold - atom systems .",
    "for instance , the kagome lattice has one flat band in its lowest three bands and quantum dynamics show that a density jump of magnitude @xmath68 emerges as particles flow from an initially filled region into an initially empty region @xcite .",
    "there is , however , a subtle difference between the flat band of the kagome lattice and that of the two - leg snnn lattice .",
    "the kagome flat - band is on top of the other two dispersive bands while that in the two - leg snnn intersects the other dispersive band .",
    "nevertheless , their roles in transport are identical .",
    "while demonstrating such a dynamical density discontinuity is straightforward in cold - atoms systems , in conventional condensed matter depleting mobile electrons completely can be very challenging and observing this phenomenon can be a daunting task .",
    "a few remarks on the two - leg snnn lattice are worth mentioning .",
    "first , the existence of the flat band depends crucially on the condition of uniform tunneling coefficients .",
    "if the diagonal ( a - a and b - b ) links have a different tunneling coefficient @xmath69 , the bands start to curve and there is no longer a flat band .",
    "we have tested the case for @xmath70 and found that when @xmath71 is close to @xmath72 , the flat - band is bent only slightly and a sharp density difference is still observable , but as @xmath71 decreases , the sharp density difference decays away .",
    "the resulting dispersion of the two - leg snnn lattice @xmath73 yields two maximal group velocities for the two bands . as the flat band distorts ,",
    "the atoms propagate in a light - cone structure bound by @xmath74 , while atoms in the dispersive band reach a maximum velocity of @xmath75 .",
    "figure  [ fig : distortedband ] summarizes the behavior as @xmath71 is decreased .",
    "we also caution that the density - averaged velocity @xcite may not fully account for the underlying transport when multiple bands are present .",
    "for instance , there are two maximal velocities shown in fig .  [ fig : distortedband ] , and an averaged velocity will average out this feature .    secondly , in the presence of magnetic flux penetrating the ladder , the dispersion exhibits additional interesting features and the system is known as the creutz ladder @xcite and transport in the square lattice with effective magnetic flux has been recently studied in cold - atom systems  @xcite . here ,",
    "we focus only on geometrical effects on transport .     ( a ) , @xmath76 ( b ) , and @xmath77 ( c ) . here",
    "the case with @xmath78 has been shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] ( c ) .",
    "( d ) using ( b ) as an example , the maximal rates of density spreading , @xmath79 , bound the light - cone structures of the two bands . ]",
    "transport behavior can be altered by introducing strong interactions as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the presence of interaction , however , band theory has limited applicability and full numerical simulations are usually required .",
    "a lack of efficient numerical methods for studying 2d interacting systems makes a full discussion of interaction effects out of the scope of this work .",
    "here we only demonstrate that in the presence of weak interactions which may be treated in the mean - field approximation , the geometrical effects are still observable .",
    "we consider two - component fermions labeled by spins @xmath80 , which may be different species of atoms or the same atoms in two different internal states . for contact interactions common in cold atoms ,",
    "the system may be described by the hubbard model @xcite @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 is the onsite repulsion coupling constant .",
    "the equations of motion for the hubbard model can not be solved analytically due to the presence of multi - particle correlations . here",
    ", we follow ref .  @xcite and implement the standard hartree - fock approximation by decomposing @xmath84 as @xmath85 . then the equations of motion become @xmath86 , which can be solved numerically .",
    "we impose the condition @xmath87 at any time . our numerical results for @xmath88 show no qualitative difference from the corresponding noninteracting fermion cases .",
    "on the other hand , the interactions could influence the flat band and there will be leaks from the flat - band states . however , the leaking rate is extremely small in the weakly interacting regime @xmath89 . within the time scale of our simulations ,",
    "the density discontinuity remains visible .",
    "therefore , the conclusions from the noninteracting case should hold when the background interactions are weak .",
    "here we discuss possible experimental realizations and applications of this work . the optical square and triangular lattices have been demonstrated @xcite and geometrical effects on transport should be observable on those lattices .",
    "the snnn lattice is similar to the checkerboard lattice of ref .",
    "@xcite whose diagonal tunneling ( a - a or b - b ) is expected to be weaker than the nearest - neighbor tunneling ( a - b ) due to the in - plane geometry .",
    "the snnn lattice with a tunable ratio between those two tunneling coefficients may be created by bilayer square lattices illustrated in figure  [ fig : illustration ] ( e ) , which is similar to those discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the need of an additional phase shift between the two layers will be a challenge . by adjusting either the lattice depth on each sheet or the distance between the two sheets , the relative strength of the two tunneling coefficients can be tuned .",
    "while genuine bilayer optical lattices have not be available , multi - layer optical lattices have been experimentally realized for the honeycomb lattice as an analogue of graphene @xcite . to realize two - leg ladders of the snnn lattice for supporting the flat - band , a tight background harmonic trap or laser sheets @xcite for confining the atoms in a narrow transverse region may also be needed . as the geometry and tunneling coefficients change , the energy dispersion as well as the group velocity of the fermions change accordingly .",
    "we end our discussion of geometrical effects on matter - wave propagation by presenting a possible application in the zig - zag lattice optical lattice @xcite , which is basically a two - leg ladder of the triangular lattice as shown in the inset of figure  [ fig : zzl ] .",
    "the hopping coefficient along the horizontal direction is @xmath90 and that along the diagonal is @xmath69 , and the ratio between them are assumed to be continuously tunable .",
    "the initial condition is identical to the previous cases with the left half of the lattice being a band insulator and the right half being empty , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : zzl ] .",
    "when @xmath91 and @xmath90 gives the time scale @xmath92 , the two legs decouple and it takes @xmath93 for the matter wave to reach the far right boundary . in the opposite limit",
    "when @xmath94 and @xmath69 gives the same time scale @xmath92 , it takes @xmath95 because the particle has to traverse twice the distance to reach the far right boundary .",
