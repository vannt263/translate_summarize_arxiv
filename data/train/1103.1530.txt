    "the elo system for rating chess players @xcite , named after its creator arpad elo , has been employed by the world chess federation for over four decades as a method for assessing players strengths and ranking them in official tournaments .",
    "although not without controversy , it is accepted as generally reliable , and is also used in other games and sports such as scrabble , go , american football and major league basketball .    the elo rating system is based on the model of paired comparisons @xcite , which can be applied to the problem of ranking any set of objects for which we have a preference relation .",
    "the model is particularly useful in that a ranking can be obtained in situations where a preference exists only for some of the pairs of objects under consideration .",
    "paired comparison models have been successfully applied to measure ability in competitive games and sports @xcite , the most notable example being the widely used elo system for rating chess players .",
    "several extensions to the elo system have been proposed , notably the glicko @xcite and trueskill @xcite bayesian rating systems .",
    "both these systems estimate , in addition to the rating , the degree of uncertainty that the rating represents the player s true ability .",
    "the uncertainty allows the system to control the change made to the rating after a game has been played . in particular ,",
    "if the uncertainty is low then the changes made to the rating should be smaller as the rating is already reasonably accurate , while if the uncertainty is high then the changes made to the rating should be larger .    here",
    "we adopt the bradley - terry model @xcite , which provides the theoretical underpinning of elo s model , where the probability @xmath1 that a player @xmath2 , whose strength is @xmath3 , wins against a player @xmath4 , whose strength is @xmath5 , is given by the logistic function @xmath6 , namely @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a positive scaling factor .",
    "we note that @xmath6 is strictly monotonically increasing , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , @xmath12    in this paper we are interested in the distribution of ratings within the pool of players that arises as a result of the model induced by ( [ eq : log ] ) .",
    "we are not aware of any research in this direction , although it is generally accepted that this distribution is well approximated by a gaussian ( i.e. normal ) distribution @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that elo @xcite claimed that the distribution of ratings of established chess players was not gaussian , and suggested the maxwell - boltzmann distribution as an alternative that fitted the data he used slightly better .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : elo ] we review the elo rating system , and in section  [ sec : fide ] we do some exploratory data analysis on published official chess rating data . we show that the gaussian distribution provides a very good fit to the data , but there is a small negative skew present . in section  [ sec : urn ]",
    "we propose an evolutionary stochastic model , which as a first attempt assumes a symmetric distribution of ratings . the derivation of the distribution is presented in section  [ sec : derive ] , where we prove that the resulting distribution is indeed normal , with the interesting feature that the variance increases with time in a logarithmic fashion . in section  [ sec : chess ]",
    "we validate the model using published rating data from january 2007 to january 2010 , and in section  [ sec : skew ] we modify the model to allow for the skewness present in the data . with reference to this data ,",
    "we show through simulation that the modified model yields a better approximation to the actual distribution .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conc ] we give our concluding remarks .",
    "we now summarise elo s rating system @xcite in order to set in context the evolutionary model that we present in section  [ sec : urn ] .",
    "the fundamental assumption of elo s rating system is that each player has a current playing strength . in a game played between players @xmath2 and @xmath4 , with unknown strengths @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the score of the game for player @xmath2",
    "is denoted by @xmath15 , where @xmath15 is 1 if @xmath2 wins , 0 if @xmath2 loses and @xmath16 if the game is a draw .",
    "its expected value is assumed to be @xcite @xmath17[eq : elo - factor ] where @xmath18 is the expectation operator and @xmath19    the elo system attempts to estimate the strength @xmath13 of player @xmath2 using a calculated rating @xmath20 , which is adjusted according to the results of games played by @xmath2 .",
    "we observe that this model is related to the bradley - terry model for paired comparison data @xcite ; see also @xcite .    after playing a game against player @xmath4 , player @xmath2 s rating",
    "is adjusted according to the following formula ( see equation ( 2 ) in @xcite ) @xmath21 where @xmath22 ( known as the @xmath22-factor ) is the maximum number of points by which a rating can be changed as a result of a single game .",
    "( a high @xmath22-factor gives more weight to recent results , while a low @xmath22-factor increases the relative influence of results from earlier games . ) in the elo system the @xmath22-factor is typically between 10 and 30 .",
    "( there has been some controversy involving a recent proposal by the world chess federation to change the @xmath22-factor @xcite . ) for the purpose of experimentation we have fixed the @xmath22-factor at 20 .    when using ( [ eq : adjust ] ) to update @xmath20 , @xmath23 is estimated from ( [ eq : elo ] ) using the current values of @xmath20 and @xmath24 as estimates of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "player @xmath4 s rating is updated similarly .",
    "we note that , after updating both @xmath2 s and @xmath4 s ratings , the sum of their ratings remains unchanged .",
    "the above method can be straightforwardly extended to the case of a player competing in a tournament , or to a number of games played over a given period .",
    "the world chess federation , known as fide , publishes a rating list several times each year . traditionally fide published the rating list every three months , but from 2009 has moved to bi - monthly publication ; the official rating data can be obtained from http://ratings.fide.com .",
    "here we are interested in the distribution of the players ratings .",
    "it has been confirmed by charness and gerchak @xcite , and by bilali et al .",
    "@xcite that the distribution is well approximated by a gaussian distribution .",
    "we recall that the probability density function for a gaussian random variable @xmath25 takes the form , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mean and @xmath28 is the standard deviation of @xmath25 .    with these observations in mind , we performed some exploratory data analysis on the fide rating data from january 2007 to january 2010 . to test the normality of the data , we binned each of the four data sets , taking the bin width to be 20 ( the fixed @xmath22-factor ) .",
    "the resulting plots for january 2007 to january 2010 are shown on the left - hand side of figure  [ fig : rating ] .",
    "we then fitted a constant multiple of a gaussian distribution to each of the four data sets , using matlab .",
    "the plots for the fitted data for january 2007 to january 2010 are shown on the right - hand side of figure  [ fig : rating ] .",
    "the fitted parameters , @xmath29 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , are shown in table  [ table : gauss ] , where @xmath29 is the multiplicative constant .",
    "clearly , @xmath29 is an approximation to the actual number of players @xmath30 .",
    "table  [ table : gauss ] also shows @xmath31 , the coefficient of determination @xcite . it can be seen that this is close to 1 , which indicates a very good fit . for comparison ,",
    "the last two columns in the table show the mean @xmath32 and standard deviation @xmath33 computed from the actual fide rating data . on average @xmath33 is about 7 - 15 elo points greater than the fitted standard deviation @xmath28 .",
    "+     +    .[table : gauss ] the parameters for the fitted gaussians in figure  [ fig : rating ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have constructed a stochastic evolutionary urn model that generates the distribution of players ratings and have validated this model using published official rating data on chess players . for the symmetric case , our analysis of the model yielded a gaussian distribution , which has the interesting feature that the variance increases logarithmically with time .",
    "this implies that the distribution of ratings is quite stable , but has the tendency to flatten extremely slowly over time .",
    "these results were validated by simulating the model .",
    "although the data is well approximated by a gaussian , there is a small negative skew present in the data .",
    "an improvement can be made to the model to account for this by breaking the symmetry and putting new players into lower - numbered urns , corresponding to new players generally having lower than average ratings .",
    "the modified stochastic process was validated by simulation starting with actual rating data .",
    "deriving analytically the distribution for the modified process remains an open problem .    throughout the paper we have assumed that the @xmath22-factor is fixed at 20 .",
    "it would be interesting to allow the @xmath22-factor to vary with players ratings and the number of games they have played , as suggested in @xcite , and to see whether such a modification could shed some light on the @xmath22-factor controversy mentioned in section  [ sec : elo ] .",
