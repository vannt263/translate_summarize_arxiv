    "the bulk properties of the quantum hall systems at filling fraction @xmath0 , @xmath1 odd , in the presence of low magnetic fields have been subject of many theoretical and experimental investigations in recent years .",
    "the spin degree of freedom plays an important role in these systems . here",
    "we focus on properties of the boundary of these systems , which , in a special way , reflect bulk properties . in the spinless case this reflection was already described by wen @xcite .",
    "the low - energy ( bulk ) physics of these systems is identical to the one of 2d quantum ferromagnets with spin waves as excitations . due to exchange the spins of electrons in the ground state",
    "are all aligned in the same direction and the lowest lying excitations are one - spin - flip ( spin wave ) excitations which leave the charge of the system unchanged .",
    "the lowest lying charged excitations are topologically non - trivial skyrmion excitations @xcite for which a local change in the charge density that characterizes them , is accompanied by a local change in the spin density .",
    "this scenario , in which a finite number of overturned spins follows the creation of the charged excitations is supported by experimental findings @xcite .    on the other hand the physics of the boundary of quantum hall systems without the spin degree of freedom",
    "is well understood @xcite .",
    "in fact for any quantum hall system , including the one which edge physics we would like to understand , it is expected that the charge dynamics is reduced to the edge of the system .",
    "this is maybe an oversimplification with respect to a general experimental situation where sharp edges ( i.e. edges with steep confining potential ) are not always present .",
    "still the effective one - space - dimensional edge theory - chiral boson theory of quantum hall systems has received considerable experimental support in recent years .    here",
    "we present a low - energy effective theory of quantum hall ferromagnetic systems which describes the charge degrees of freedom restricted to live only on the edge and lowest lying excitations of the bulk - neutral spin waves .",
    "we show that , under special conditions ( and as solutions of the theory ) , edge spin waves exist , whose characteristic width is smaller than the one of bulk spin waves , which spread throughout the whole system .",
    "these excitations , edge spin waves , are characterized by gaps which are smaller than the zeeman gap and linear dispersion relations .",
    "we find two classes of these waves , wich we call , charged and neutral edge spin waves .",
    "one way to induce the charged edge waves is to subtract or add some charge to the edge . by a redistribution of the charge and ,",
    "simultaneously , spin of the system on the edge ( in the manner of spin textures as described first in @xcite ) neutral edge spin waves are possible .",
    "in this section , we will first rederive the edge theory for spinless electrons @xcite using the dual form of the chern - simons field - theory description of quantum hall systems ( at filling fractions @xmath0 where @xmath2 is an odd integer .",
    "then we will use the dual form of the chern - simons formulation of the ferromagnetic quantum hall systems ( at the same filling fractions with the spin degree of freedom taken into account ) to derive a low energy effective theory which describes not only the edge of these systems , but also lowest lying excitations in their bulk - spin waves . at the end",
    "we will demonstrate the gauge invariance of our total , bulk plus edge , action when perturbing external electromagnetic fields are present in it .",
    "the systems that we consider are at filling fractions @xmath0 where @xmath2 is an odd integer .",
    "we start with the dual formulation of the chern - simons effective description of these systems . in the chern - simons formulation",
    "the problem of the 2d electron system in magnetic field is mapped to a problem of bose liquid with a long - range interaction described by a ststistical gauge field .",
    "the vortex excitations of the bose fluid correspond to the quasiparticle excitations of quantum hall systems . in the dual form",
    "the vortex excitations ( i.e. fluxes of the gauge field in the preceding formulation ) are viewed as particles , and the charge -current density becomes flux of some new gauge field .",
    "the first terms of the lagrangian density in the dual form are : @xmath3 the vector potential @xmath4 represents the newly introduced gauge field , which enters the definition of the charge current - density @xmath5 : @xmath6 @xmath7 the vector potential @xmath8 describes the external electromagnetic field , and two first terms when @xmath9 is `` integrated out '' give the basic hall response of the system i.e. the hall conductance equal to @xmath10 . the third term couples the vortex current - density @xmath11 , @xmath12 to the gauge field @xmath9 ( according to the interchanged roles of fluxes and particles ) . in [ vorcur ]",
    "@xmath13 is the phase of the bose field in the former ( non - dual ) formulation and the vortex current - density is non - zero only if @xmath14 is a nonanalytic function of coordinates i.e. @xmath15 for some @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "if our system has a boundary the action for a general gauge transformation @xmath18 for which @xmath19 is not zero at the boundary is not gauge invariant ( i.e. charge conserving ) . any electric field along the boundary will produce a current normal to the boundary because of the nonzero value of the hall conductance .",
    "but with restricted gauge transformations for which @xmath20 on the boundary we may use this action to derive , as was already done in @xcite , the kinetic term of the edge theory lagrangian .",
    "these gauge transformations describe a well - defined boundary problem , in which some of the physics of the quantum hall systems due to perturbing external electromagnetic fields is not present .",
    "namely , by making all previously gauge dependent quantities on the edge gauge independent i.e. physical , we are deriving an effective edge theory that gives the right physics when charge exchange between the bulk and edge is absent @xcite .",
    "( we defer description of the total action with perturbing electromagnetic fields which is explicitly gauge invariant to subsection ii c. )    first we neglect the last term in [ lagr ] ( as a higher order term in derivatives ) , regard the equation of motion for @xmath21 as a constraint , and take @xmath22 .",
    "the constraint is @xmath23 simply saying that any deviation in the charge density of the system is due to the creation of vortices .",
    "the solution of this equation , up to a gauge transformation is @xmath24 we assume that there are no vortices in the bulk of the system so that @xmath13 is analytic .",
    "when we plug in the solution [ solu ] in the remaining term of the lagrangian ( we do not consider the term with @xmath25 ) : @xmath26 we get , up to a total time derivative and with an assumption that @xmath25 is time independent , that @xmath27 this total divergence can be translated into a surface term : @xmath28 exactly the kinetic term of the chiral boson theory , if we consider the system to be defined in the lower half - plane with @xmath29 as a boundary .",
    "we get only the kinetic term of the edge theory because we started from the theory in which we neglected terms that bring dynamics .",
    "we might expect that the following term in small momentum expansion on the edge is @xmath30 with a nonuniversal coupling @xmath31 .",
    "this term gives dynamics to the edge theory and together with [ surf ] makes the chiral boson theory lagrangian density .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the field @xmath13 - phase of the bosonic field in the standard chern - simons formulation on the boundary plays the role of the chiral boson field .",
    "the lagrangian density of the chern - simons theory for ferromagnetic quantum hall states in the dual form is @xcite : @xmath32 again the charge current - density as a function of the statistical gauge field @xmath33 is given by the relation [ basic ] .",
    "now quasiparticle current - density consists of two contributions : vortex and skyrmion : @xmath34 . as before vortex excitations do not change the spin configuration of the ferromagnetic hall states .",
    "skyrmions , on the other hand , which lie lower in the energy spectrum , represent excitations followed by reversal of electron spins in the system .",
    "the vortex current - density is given by [ vorcur ] where again @xmath13 is the phase of the bosonic field of the standard chern - simons formulation , and the skyrmion current - density @xcite is : @xmath35 the field @xmath36 is the two component spinor of the standard chern - simons formulation @xcite , in which the bosonic field is decomposed in an amplitude , phase , and spinor part : @xmath37 the spinor part describes the spin degree of freedom of the bosonic field associated with the original electron field .",
    "the fourth , extra term with respect to spinless case in the lagrangian density is the nonlinear sigma model term with @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are pauli matrices .",
    "@xmath41 is the stiffness constant .",
    "this term represents the cost in the exchange energy when the ground state ferromagnetic configuration is modified .",
    "the fifth term is the zeeman term with constant @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the external magnetic field .    to get",
    "the low - energy , effective theory which includes the edge physics , we repeat steps that we described in the previous subsection in the spinless case . the constraint equation in this case , as we vary @xmath44 is : @xmath45 the solution to this constraint is : @xmath46 now we assume that @xmath13 is analytic so that no vortex excitations in the bulk are allowed .",
    "we do not make any restrictions on @xmath36 . by plugging in the solution [ ssolu ] in the begining lagrangian [ lagrs ] with @xmath47 and without the second and the last term we get surface terms : @xmath48 the field @xmath13",
    "can not be found anymore in the bulk lagrangian .",
    "therefore pure charge degrees of freedom i.e. those that are not followed by a change in the spin configuration are now restricted to live only on the boundary of the system .",
    "( this coincides with the microscopic physical picture that we have of these systems . the pure charge ( quasihole ) excitations , which lie higher in the energy spectrum than skyrmion excitations , in the bulk ,",
    "can be found in the low enery approximation on the edge of the system . there , on the edge , their excitation energy is smallest ( in fact goes to zero).@xcite ) in [ surter ] we see the most important result of this derivation , namely a nontrivial coupling between the spin and charge degrees of freedom on the edge of the system .",
    "in the low - energy approximation that we make ( i.e. neglecting the last term in [ lagrs ] ) we find that the charge current is equal to the sum of skyrmion and vortex currents .",
    "as we do not have vortex currents in the bulk of the system , the condition that the skyrmion current normal to the boundary is zero is equvalent to the demand that the charge current normal to the boundary is zero . in the absence of any external electromagnetic fields besides the uniform magnetic that defines the problem , we will require that no charge can leave the system i.e. the skyrmion current normal to the boundary is zero . in that case @xmath49 and we may rewrite ( after a partial integration ) the second surface term in the @xmath50 as @xmath51\\ ] ] besides , as we did not break the gauge invariance under the gauge transformation defined as : @xmath52 and present in the bosonic chern - simons formulation with field [ field ] , we may also demand the same invariance on the edge of the system .",
    "this invariance is an expression of the confinement of spin and charge on electrons , and should exist also on the edge . as a result",
    "the surface gauge - invariant kinetic term that contains the field @xmath13 is @xmath53 we can conclude that with respect to the spinless case instead of @xmath54 in the case with spin we have @xmath55 by considering couplings with external fields we may also conclude that these gauge - invariant expressions up to some appropriate constants represent charge density and current on the edge similarly to the the spinless case",
    ". then [ expres ] formally expresses the physical fact that the charge current and density on the edge have contributions followed by changes in the spin configuration on the edge .",
    "therefore we expect that under inclusion of a charge - density interaction term ( which describes the dynamics on the edge ) so that the lagrangian density is @xmath56 we have a complete low - energy description of the charge degree of freedom on the edge .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath13 on the edge simply tells us that the charge on the edge drifts with velocity @xmath31 along the edge in only one direction as it should be in a quantum hall system .    at this stage of deriving the low - energy , effective theory ,",
    "the bulk lagrangian density is @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "now we will apply the spin - wave approximation in which field @xmath36 is decomposed in the following way @xmath59 the complex bosonic field @xmath60 expresses fluctuations with respect to the ground state configuration and is to be considered small and slowly varying , and therefore , we will keep only terms quadratic in @xmath60 .",
    "then , the @xmath61 dimensional lagrangian density [ restlag ] of the bulk becomes @xmath62 and the @xmath61 dimensional lagrangian density of the bulk @xmath63 and [ lagbu ] ( in the spin - wave approximation ) in order to explain the meaning of the surface term [ extrasur ] . in that case , the corresponding euler - lagrange equations for the field @xmath60 is @xmath64 in the bulk , and @xmath65 on the edge . the normal mode solutions of [ bueq ] in the bulk are spin waves , @xmath66 with the dispersion relation : @xmath67 to satisfy boundary condition [ baeq ] , the class of solutions is further reduced to the form : @xmath68 the condition [ baeq ] ensures that spin currents normal to the boundary are zero .",
    "namely , if we use the noether expression for them , @xmath69 where @xmath70 are pauli matrices and @xmath71 ( a lagrangian density of a quantum ferromagnet ) is @xmath72 we may find in the spin - wave approximation the following expressions for them : @xmath73 we neglected the terms of order higher than two in @xmath60 ; the single condition [ baeq ] ensures that all of them are zero at the boundary .",
    "the edge spin - wave solutions of the form @xmath74 @xmath75 positive , satisfy the equation in the bulk , but the condition [ baeq ] forces @xmath75 to be zero . therefore , in the case of a pure quantum ferromagnet , the constraint of the spin conservation on the boundary , does not allow the existance of the edge spin excitations .",
    "now , we will summarize our effective theory for a quantum hall system with a boundary , having in mind the specific geometry in which the system is in the lower half of the plane .",
    "the bulk lagrangian density ( in the spin wave approximation ) is given by @xmath76 and the edge lagrangian density is @xmath77 where @xmath78      in the spinless case the effective action of the bulk , @xmath79 when the field @xmath80 is integrated out , is @xmath81 on the other hand the edge action with external electromagnetic field included is @xcite @xmath82   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{1}{2 \\pi m } ( v a_{x}^{ext } - a_{0}^{ext } ) \\partial_{x } \\alpha   - \\frac{1}{4 \\pi m } ( v a_{x}^{ext } - a_{0}^{ext } ) a_{x}^{ext } \\label{edaction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] under the gauge transformation @xmath83 and @xmath84 the total action , @xmath85 or @xmath86 , is invariant .",
    "namely the chiral anomaly @xcite term @xmath87 which we get by the gauge transformation of the bulk action is of the same absolute value but of opposite sign as the term that we get gauge transforming the edge action [ edaction ] .    in our previous derivation",
    "we assumed that only the vector potential of the constant magnetic field is present in [ pocetak ] and , therefore , the field @xmath88 did not have any dynamics ; by the equation of motion of the action it was constrained to satisfy @xmath89 . because of the absence of the perturbing external electromagnetic fields the whole dynamics of the system was on the edge described by the chiral boson theory ( the first two terms in [ edaction ] ) .",
    "similarly , in the case with spin , more general effective bulk action with external perturbing electromagnetic fields is @xmath90 compare with [ lagrs ] and note the absence of the vortex current @xmath91 in the action . as we pointed out before this signifies the fact that the charge excitations without spin changes are to be found on the edge of the system in the low - energy approximation .",
    "if we integrate out @xmath9 field we get @xmath92 for the edge the complete action ( see [ rezultat ] ) with external electromagnetic fields is @xmath93 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2 \\pi m } ( v a_{x}^{ext } - a_{0}^{ext } ) ( \\partial_{x } \\alpha - i \\overline{z } \\partial_{x } z ) - \\frac{1}{4 \\pi m } ( v a_{x}^{ext } - a_{0}^{ext } ) a_{x}^{ext } \\label{xxaction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again , in this case , the extra term that we get by setting @xmath94 in [ spinpocetak ] , @xmath95\\ ] ] is canceled by the term that comes out from taking @xmath96 and @xmath97 in [ xxaction ] .",
    "therefore the gauge invariance of the total action , @xmath98 ( or @xmath99 , [ begin ] and [ xxaction ] , is proved .",
    "as we take @xmath100 to be the vector potential of the constant magnetic field and apply the spin - wave approximation the action [ begin ] is transformed into [ dvapet ] and the edge action becomes [ rezultat ] .",
    "as we vary the surface terms of the low - energy effective lagrangian ( [ effbu ] and [ effed])with respect to @xmath13 and @xmath101 ( or @xmath60 ) we get two equations . as we vary @xmath13 , we get @xmath102 and , by varying @xmath101 and using the previous equation , @xmath103=0 \\label{boundarye}\\ ] ] when @xmath104 i.e. there are no charge excitations on the boundary , the spin waves [ spwe ] are solutions of the bulk and surface equations . when @xmath105 , i.e. there are no spin excitations in the system ; the only solutions of the equations are charge density waves of the chiral boson theory .    from the bulk equation [ bueq ] we get the following dispersion relation for the edge spin waves [ edwave ] :",
    "@xmath106 the coefficient @xmath75 , which characterize the extension of the edge spin waves into the bulk of the system , comes from the boundary equation [ boundarye ] .",
    "the one - dimensional charge density and current are given by @xmath107 respectively .",
    "for @xmath108 , the general solution of [ chargeeq ] , we have @xmath109 and we may rewrite the equation [ boundarye ] as @xmath110      the solution of the form [ edwave ] of the equation [ spbaeq ] with @xmath111 const exists only if @xmath112 is , by itself , a constant , i.e. if there is a constant charge density along the boundary of the system . for the ground state @xmath113 , and the previous condition ( with @xmath114 )",
    "means that some ( extra ) charge is added to @xmath115 or subtracted from the system @xmath116 .",
    "plugging in the form [ edwave ] into [ spbaeq ] , and using [ disprel ] , we obtain the following candidates for solutions with @xmath75 equal to @xmath117 from which only those with @xmath75 positive can describe the edge spin - waves . in the approximations in which the second term under the square root in [ betasol ] is small , @xmath118 for @xmath119",
    "the second solution is unacceptable because our effective theory assumes ( spatially ) slowly varying quantities , which is not the case with the solution with @xmath75 large .",
    "also , we may notice looking at [ twoeq ] asymmetry between @xmath120 and @xmath121 case .",
    "one way to understand the asymmetry is to first consider the single particle picture of adding and subtracting charge to the edge of these systems . in this picture of systems without spin , adding or subtracting charge is always equivalent to simple shifts ( translations ) of the boundary . in the case of the systems with spin",
    "there is an additional possibility to add charge as shown in fig.1 .",
    "we believe that this single particle picture is behind the many body state - charged edge spin - wave for @xmath120 . this can be supported by the following consideration .",
    "first , we may try to interpret the solution as a solution of a generalized pure - spin ( quantum - ferromagnet ) problem , in which the second and third term in [ spbaeq ] correspond to some surface terms in that problem . for a finite zeeman coupling and in the small - momentum approximation",
    ", the solution with @xmath120 corresponds to the following term : @xmath122 with an effective magnetic field @xmath123 on the boundary .",
    "as we add electrons , we effectively create a magnetic field in the opposite direction of the external magnetic field .",
    "this magnetic field makes possible the creation of the spin edge solution .",
    "as we add more electrons ( @xmath112 larger ) the effective magnetic field increases in its magnitude and favors edge spin waves localized near the boundary ( @xmath75 larger ) .",
    "therefore the edge - spin - wave , one - spin flip will be more localized on the boundary if there are more pairs ( see fig.1 ) each of them energetically unfavorable because each of them consists of two electrons in the same orbital .",
    "the corresponding term ( in the pure - spin problem ) for the second solution ( with @xmath124 ) is @xmath125 it is of the opposite sign than the gradient term in the bulk and , therefore , favors the solution which disorders the spin configuration of the ground state and , we expect as it is usual in these systems , that it is also followed by a redistribution of the charge on the boundary .",
    "we also expect that these charged edge spin - waves can be created without any change in the total charge of the system i.e. by simple redistributions of the ground - state charge on the boundary where @xmath112 is a parameter that characterizes them .",
    "therefore , when considering the total energy of excitations we will neglect the energy term of the chiral boson lagrangian",
    ". then the surface contribution is @xmath126 and the contribution from the bulk is given by [ disprel].(to get [ ensur ] we normalized the wave to describe one electron spin flip : @xmath127 as a consequence , we may write the total energy of excitations as @xmath128 because @xmath129 the last term in [ etot ] is always negative , and at @xmath130 @xmath131 is always lower than the constant zeeman term . when [ twoeq ] is substituted for @xmath75 in the expression [ etot ] ,",
    "the energy [ etot ] is of the following form @xmath132 ( where @xmath133 s do not depend on k ) . by having a linear term in @xmath134",
    "this dispersion relation is asymmetric around @xmath130 .",
    "we define the neutral edge spin - waves by requiring that the field @xmath13 , which lives on the boundary , associated with pure ( not carryng also spin ) charge degrees of freedom , is zero ( @xmath135 ) . as a consequence",
    "there is one less surface equation to be satisfied , because the constraint equations [ chargeeq ] and [ boundarye ] can not be satisfied simultaneously . and",
    ", as we will see , the constraint also implies losing one of the two ( charge and spin ) local conservation laws .",
    "namely , local spin currents normal to the boundary will be nonzero in general .",
    "it will be also shown that these excitations are neutral i.e. the total change in the charge of the system , when these excitations occur , is zero .",
    "with the condition @xmath135 the charge current and density on the boundary are proportional to @xmath136 these charge degrees of freedom must satisfy [ chargeeq ] , and from that it follows that the dispersion relation for the waves is @xmath137 .",
    "this dispersion relation follows when a general solution that is a superposition of the waves of the form [ edwave ] is considered .",
    "the frequency of the wave is also equal to [ disprel ] .",
    "this enables us to find @xmath75 in this case .",
    "it is given by the following expression @xmath138 i.e. in the small - momentum approximation @xmath139 .",
    "but the waves do not satisfy [ boundarye ] , which , in the spin - wave approximation , is equivalent to the condition [ baeq ] .",
    "this means that the spin currents normal to the boundary of the system are , in general , nonzero and exchange of the spin of the system with outside is allowed .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath140 ( see [ spcurrents ] ) everywhere on the boundary and , also , the total spin of the system is conserved , i.e. @xmath141    although the bulk excitation energy @xmath142 is gapless , these excitations have a gap . to see this we have to calculate their total energy and include the surface contribution [ ensur ] , with @xmath75 given by [ betav ] . as a final result we have",
    ": @xmath143 the requirement @xmath144 for each k fixes the allowed range of the parameters in [ nuttot ] and in the theory .",
    "the excitations are allowed to propagate in both directions , though , the spectrum is assymetric around @xmath145 because of the presence of the linear term in @xmath131 .",
    "the gap ( the smallest excitation energy for certain @xmath134 ) of these excitaations is always smaller than the zeeman gap .    to prove the neutrality of these excitations we start with a general edge spin - wave solution : @xmath146 where @xmath147 are arbitrary ( complex ) coefficients in this expansion .",
    "the density of charge on the boundary of the system can be expressed as @xmath148 the same quantity in the bulk is proportional to the topological density @xcite and equal to @xmath149 in the spin - wave approximation we have @xmath150 clearly , the total change in the charge of the boundary , @xmath151 is of the same amount , but of opposite sign than the one in the bulk @xmath152 .    at the end of this section",
    "we would like to comment on the nature of these neutral edge spin waves .",
    "as they are completely skyrmionic , their charge is fully specified by their spin configuration .",
    "their spread increases with the decreasing of the zeeman energy , which is well known skyrmion property .",
    "as they carry fixed ( unit ) amount of spin they vanish when the zeeman coupling is zero .",
    "due to the close relationship between their charge and spin and linearity of the chiral boson dispersion relation , the dispersion relation of these spin waves is also linear .",
    "in conclusion , we proposed an effective edge theory for ferromagnetic quantum hall states .",
    "it describes their ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional charge degrees of freedom by a chiral boson theory and their ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional spin degrees of freedom by the effective theory of a quantum ferromagnet in the spin - wave approximation .",
    "we found two classes of the edge spin - wave solutions .",
    "the class with the charged edge spin waves is obtained by removing or adding electrons to the edge of the system .",
    "the second class of the neutral edge spin waves does not require any change in the total charge of the system .",
    "all these edge spin excitations are characterized by linear dispersion relations and gaps in the excitation energy .",
    "we did not consider most - general surface terms for the spin degrees of freedom which would be present in a most - general theory , because we wanted to emphasize and examine the influence of the terms that describe the charge degrees of freedom .",
    "the latter terms , collected in the chiral boson theory , give a complete effective description of the charge degrees of freedom on the edge .",
    "@xcite pointed out that for small zeeman energies and soft confining potentials a reconstruction ( from narrow and spin polarized edge ) to the edge with spin textures should occur .",
    "because of our assumption of the edge with the same polarization as that of the bulk , our theory is valid only for steep enough ( see for estimates in @xcite ) confining potentials .    at the end",
    "we would like to comment on the relationship between our work and the recent work concerning edge excitations and edge reconstruction at @xmath153 1 @xcite .",
    "there , the hartree - fock procedure was used to determine the energy spectrum of some proposed edge spin - flip excitations .",
    "( in fact a special form of these excitations was first suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) these excitations reconstruct the edge when the zeeman energy is small and the confining potential softened .",
    "they are followed by an outward movement of charge and exist even at zero zeeman energy .",
    "the latter property is not shared by our neutral edge excitations and charged edge excitations for @xmath120 and therefore , they should not be confused with the ones of ref .",
    "( the neutral edge waves even require , as we described , special boundary conditions to exist . ) on the other hand the detailed description of the charged edge excitations for @xmath154 ( which can be associated with the outward movement of charge ) is impossible in the scope of our theory .",
    "the theory gives only an inkling of the possible instability of the ground state with respect to their creation .",

    "<S> we propose an effective low - energy theory for ferromagnetic hall states . </S>",
    "<S> it describes the charge degrees of freedom , on the edge , by a ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional chiral boson theory , and the spin degrees of freedom by the ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional quantum ferromagnet theory in the spin - wave approximation . the usual chiral boson theory for spinless electrons </S>",
    "<S> is modified to include the charge degrees of freedom with spin . </S>",
    "<S> our total , bulk plus edge , effective action is gauge invariant and we find a generalized `` chiral anomaly '' in this case . </S>",
    "<S> we describe two , charged and neutral , sets of edge spin - wave solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the spreading of these waves is much larger than the one for the charge ( edge ) waves and they have linear dispersion relations . </S>"
