    "assemblies of dynamical elements coupled with each other are widely seen in nature .",
    "simplified models of such systems , e.g. coupled limit cycle oscillators or chaotic maps , have played important roles not only in modeling such systems realistically , but also in understanding the varieties of possible behavior of systems far from equilibrium .",
    "many important concepts , such as pattern formation or spatio - temporal chaos , have been extracted from the detailed studies on such models .",
    "the interaction between the elements are usually assumed to be attractive , and of mean - field type in a wide sense ; each element feels the mean amplitude of its neighboring elements , and driven by the difference between its amplitude and the mean amplitude , in such a way that the amplitude differences between the elements decrease .    the diffusive coupling is a representative limiting case .",
    "each element interacts strongly with its nearest neighbors , so that the amplitude field of the system is always continuous and smooth .",
    "it is well known that some diffusively coupled systems of dynamical elements , such as the complex ginzburg - landau equation , exhibit spatio - temporal chaos@xcite .",
    "the opposite limiting case is the global coupling , or the mean field coupling in the narrow sense .",
    "each element feels the mean field of the entire system , and is thus coupled to all the elements with equal strength .",
    "the amplitude field becomes statistically spatially homogeneous , and the notion of space is lost .",
    "it is known that systems with global coupling generally show some typical behavior , e.g. clustering and collective chaos@xcite .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", kuramoto introduced an intermediate system between the above two limiting cases , namely a system of non - locally coupled elements .",
    "our subsequent numerical simulations of one - dimensional non - locally coupled systems with various elements revealed that such systems generally exhibit anomalous spatio - temporal chaotic behavior , which can not be seen in the above two limiting cases . in this chaotic regime ,",
    "the amplitude field becomes fractal , and the spatial correlation of the amplitude field shows power - law behavior on small scales .",
    "furthermore , the fractal dimension and the exponent of the spatial correlation vary continuously with the coupling strength .",
    "later , we developed a theory that can explain the fractality of the amplitude field and the power - law behavior of the spatial correlation based on a simple multiplicative stochastic model@xcite .",
    "such a model is frequently employed in describing the noisy on - off intermittency phenomena@xcite found in many physical systems , and this implies that our system should also exhibit this type of temporal intermittency",
    ". induced by the temporal intermittency , our system is also spatially intermittent . in order to study this",
    ", we expanded our analysis of the amplitude field into more general @xmath0-th structure functions , and found that the amplitude field shows multi - affinity .",
    "we also introduced multi - fractal analysis of the difference field of the original amplitude field , inspired by its seeming similarity to the intermittent energy dissipation field in fluid turbulence@xcite .",
    "all our previous studies have been done in one - dimensional systems .",
    "however , our previous theory does not require the systems to be one - dimensional , and spatio - temporal chaos with power - law structure functions is also expected in higher dimensions . in this paper , we study a system of non - locally coupled complex ginzburg - landau oscillators in two dimensions for the first time , and investigate its anomalous spatio - temporal chaotic regime .",
    "some attention is paid to the multi - scaling properties of the intermittent amplitude and difference fields .",
    "as proposed by kuramoto@xcite , the non - local coupling naturally appears in the following plausible situation .",
    "consider an assembly of spatially distributed dynamical elements , e.g. cells .",
    "each element is assumed to interact indirectly with other elements through some ( e.g. chemical ) substance , which diffuses and decays much faster than the dynamics of the element .",
    "such a situation will be described by the following set of equations : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the amplitude of the element , @xmath3 is the dynamics of the amplitude , and @xmath4 is the concentration of the substance with decay rate @xmath5 and diffusion rate @xmath6 .",
    "the substance @xmath4 is generated at a rate proportional to the amplitude @xmath2 , and the amplitude @xmath2 is affected by the substance @xmath4 with a coupling matrix @xmath7 .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 determines the ratio of time scale of the elements to that of the substance , and is assumed to be very small .",
    "namely , the dynamics of the substance is much faster than that of the elements .",
    "now , let us consider the @xmath9 limit and eliminate the dynamics of @xmath4 adiabatically .",
    "putting the left - hand side of eq.([eq:02 ] ) to @xmath10 , we can solve the equation for @xmath4 as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a kernel that satisfies @xmath13 by inserting eq.([eq : a ] ) into eq.([eq:01 ] ) , we obtain the following system of non - locally coupled dynamical elements : @xmath14    the kernel @xmath12 can be solved as @xmath15}{\\eta + d |{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$q$}}}|^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the dimension of the space .",
    "when the system is isotropic , the kernel @xmath17 becomes a function of the distance @xmath18 , and is expressed as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the modified bessel function .",
    "the constant @xmath21 gives the inverse of the coupling length , and is calculated as @xmath22 each @xmath23 must satisfy the normalization condition @xmath24 .",
    "since we treat a two - dimensional system , we use eq.([eq : kernel2d ] ) for @xmath23 hereafter .    as elements",
    ", we use complex ginzburg - landau oscillators .",
    "they are the simplest limit cycle oscillators that can be derived by the center - manifold reduction technique from generic oscillators near their hopf bifurcation points@xcite .",
    "the corresponding non - locally coupled system is given by the following equation for the complex amplitude @xmath25 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the coupling strength , @xmath28 are real parameters , and the non - local mean field @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 this is the non - local complex ginzburg - landau equation introduced by kuramoto@xcite as the first concrete example of non - locally coupled systems .",
    "in the numerical simulations presented here , we assume the total system to be a square lattice with both sides unit length long . the elements are placed on the lattice sites , and periodic boundary conditions are assumed .",
    "we use @xmath31 elements , and fix the coupling length @xmath32 at @xmath33 . the non - local mean field",
    "is easily calculated by using the fft technique , since it is simply a convolution of the amplitude field with the kernel  ( [ eq : kernel2d ] ) .",
    "we fix the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 at @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "these are the standard values already used in our previous one - dimensional simulations .    in fig.[fig:01]-[fig:03 ] , typical snapshots of the real part @xmath38 of the complex variable @xmath39 are shown for three different values of coupling strength @xmath27 . since we obtain similar figures for the imaginary part @xmath40 by symmetry , we use @xmath41 in the following analysis and call it amplitude field . the amplitude field at @xmath42 is continuous and smooth , while at @xmath43 it seems to be discontinuous and disordered , although not completely random . the amplitude field at the intermediate coupling strength @xmath44 looks somewhat more complex and intriguing ; it is composed of intricately convoluted smooth and disordered patches of various length scales .",

    "each correlation function is clearly rotationally symmetric due to the isotropy of the system .",
    "as the amplitude field becomes disordered , the correlation function becomes steep , and the center of the graph , which corresponds to the self - correlation @xmath46 , becomes peaked .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", the anomalous spatio - temporal chaotic regime was characterized by the power - law behavior of the spatial correlation function in small distance : @xmath47 where @xmath48 are constants and @xmath49 is a non - integer parameter - dependent exponent .    to confirm if this power - law behavior also holds in two dimension , we calculated the radial correlation function @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) along a straight line in a certain direction or the @xmath52 direction , but results are independent of the direction . ] , and estimated the best fitting parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    ". figure  [ fig:05 ] shows @xmath55 vs. @xmath56 $ ] for several values of the coupling strength @xmath27 .",
    "for each coupling strength , the experimental data are almost on a straight line , and the power - law behavior is evident .",
    "the exponent @xmath49 of the power law varies continuously with the coupling strength .",
    "although not shown in the figure , the correlation function @xmath57 is continuous at the origin @xmath58 for @xmath59 , but discontinuous at @xmath60 .",
    "there appears a finite gap between the self - correlation @xmath61 and the correlation between the nearest - neighbor elements @xmath62 .",
    "this means that the individual motion of the element becomes so violent that the amplitude field is no longer continuous statistically . in ref.@xcite , this transition point was identified with the blowout bifurcation point in the on - off intermittent dynamics of the amplitude difference between nearby elements .",
    "thus , the anomalous spatio - temporal chaos in two dimension is also characterized by power - law behavior of the spatial correlation function with a parameter - dependent exponent .",
    "= 0.4    = 0.4",
    "in ref.@xcite , we clarified that the scaling behavior of the spatial correlation is a consequence of underlying multiplicative processes of amplitude differences between neighboring elements .",
    "we described this process by a multiplicative stochastic model , and related the exponent @xmath49 of the spatial correlation with the fluctuation of the finite - time lyapunov exponent of the element .",
    "such a model is essentially identical with those used in describing noisy on - off intermittency@xcite , which indicates that our system also exhibits this type of temporal intermittency .",
    "actually , the finite - time lyapunov exponent of the complex ginzburg - landau oscillator can fluctuate between positive and negative values , and neighboring oscillators are subjected to only slightly different non - local mean field",
    ". therefore , the conditions for the appearance of noisy on - off intermittency are satisfied in our system .",
    "now , let us confirm this in our system numerically .",

    "the distance between the elements is @xmath65 for @xmath63 , and @xmath66 for @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "strong intermittency of the signals is apparent .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath64 shows more frequent bursts than @xmath63 , reflecting that @xmath64 is subjected to larger fluctuations than @xmath63 .",
    "we can confirm that these intermittent signals are actually noisy on - off intermittent by calculating the laminar length distribution .",
    "the laminar phase is defined as a successive duration where the absolute value of the difference does not exceeds a certain threshold . here",
    "we choose @xmath67 as the threshold value .",
    "figure  [ fig:07 ] shows laminar length distributions @xmath68 obtained from @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the characteristic shape of the distribution @xmath68 , i.e. , the power - law dependence on @xmath69 with slope @xmath70 for small @xmath69 , and the exponential shoulder seen in the large @xmath69 region , clearly indicates that the signals are actually noisy on - off intermittent .",
    "the shoulder reflects broken scale invariance due to the additive noise .",

    "according to the multi - fractal formalism , two types of partition functions are defined as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is calculated along a certain straight line in some direction as in the case of the previous spatial correlation function , while @xmath83 is calculated over the whole system .",

    "moreover , our previous theory predicts the following form for the scaling exponent @xmath89 of the amplitude field : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a positive constant determined by the fluctuation of the finite - time lyapunov exponent of the element , and is related to the slope of the probability distribution of @xmath91@xcite .",
    "this is the simplest form of multi - affinity , and sometimes called bi - fractality@xcite .",
