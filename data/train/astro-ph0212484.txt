    "from a sample of stars with the b[e ] phenomenon ( lamers et al . 1998 ) observed by us with the feros and b&c spectrograph at 1.52 telescope in eso ( la silla , chile - agreement eso / on ) , we have analyzed the circumstellar medium around hen 2 - 90 , a unclassified b[e ] star ( that is sometimes classified in the literature as a compact planetary nebulae ) considering the presence of a rotating disk .",
    "its presence is suggested by images taken with wfpc2 in hst ( sahai & nyman 2000 ) and also by the presence of double peaked profiles in its spectrum . our analysis is based on the comparison between the observed luminosity of [ sii ] lines and h@xmath0 with those predicted by a model that will be described below .",
    "the existence of a rotating disk at hen 2 - 90 is confirmed by the presence of many forbidden and permitted lines with double peaks ( see figure 1 ) . from the separation between two peaks we have found a @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 20 km s@xmath5 .",
    "60truecm 5.5truecm [ oiii ] and [ ariii ] double peaked profiles present in the high resolution spectra ( feros ) of hen 2 - 90 .",
    "* 2 spherical envelopes , considering one representing the polar wind and the other representing the disk .",
    "the ionization is calculated with a photoionization model for h , he and s. one envelope has a higher density than the other and we only use the equatorial sector with a width of 15 degrees . the other has a lower density and we are considering the luminosity that comes from the remaining region , outside the disk . * @xmath6 is an input parameter * the [ sii ] lines come only from the disk and h@xmath0 has two components that are coming from both regions .",
    "we have found a @xmath6 @xmath4 10@xmath7 m@xmath8 year@xmath5 for the disk region , if all s is sii .",
    "this value is low compared with other compact planetary nebula .",
    "if the sii fraction ( sii / s ) is only 10@xmath9 , then the @xmath6 is @xmath4 10@xmath10 m@xmath8 year@xmath5 , because we have found that @xmath6 is proportional to ( sii / s)@xmath11 ( borges fernandes et al .",
