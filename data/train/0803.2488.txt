    "the interest on low - dimensional fermi systems has been recently reinvoked by the experimental developments of cooling and trapping atoms in optical lattices  @xcite and on atom chips  @xcite . with the aid of tuning an external magnetic field through a feshbach resonance ,",
    "these techniques provide a fascinating possibility of creating quasi - low - dimensional fermi systems with a controllable fermion - fermion interaction .",
    "in particular , the interaction between fermions can be tuned from a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) limit to a bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) limit , such that the bcs - bec crossover can be studied in quasi low dimensions .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover has been extensively studied in three - dimensional ( 3d ) fermi systems , where a single - channel model  @xcite and a two - channel model  @xcite are both applied to give a consistent description around a wide feshbach resonance .",
    "this agreement between single- and two - channel models is rooted from the fact that the closed - channel ( feshbach molecule ) population is negligible near a wide resonance , so it will not cause any significant difference by taking the molecules into account ( as in the two - channel model ) or completely neglecting them ( as in the single - channel model ) .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover of a uniform two - dimensional ( 2d ) fermi system has also been considered in connection with high-@xmath0 superconductors  @xcite , where an effective 2d hamiltonian with renormalized fermion - fermion interaction is employed .    in this paper , we study the bcs - bec crossover in a quasi-2d fermi gas , first using an effective 2d hamiltonian with renormalized atom - atom interaction ( model 1 ) @xcite , and then a more general model with renormalized interaction between atoms and dressed molecules ( model 2 )  @xcite .",
    "the dressed molecules mainly come from population of atoms in the excited levels along the strongly confined axial direction near a feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "when considering the effect of a weak harmonic trap in the two loosely confined dimensions under the local density approximation ( lda ) , we adapt the mean - field ( mf ) treatment to calculate the zero temperature cloud size and number density distribution in the radial plane .",
    "we find a significant difference between the two models . by using model 2 ,",
    "we show that the cloud size decreases from the limiting value of a weakly interacting fermi gas as one moves from the bcs to the bec side of the feshbach resonance , and approaches to the limiting value of a weakly interacting bose gas in the bec limit .",
    "this behavior is a signature of the bcs - bec crossover in quasi two dimensions . on the contrary ,",
    "model 1 fails to describe this crossover behavior , but predicts a constant cloud size and identical density profile for all magnetic field detunings .",
    "this discrepancy implies that the mf results given by model 1 is unreliable , even at a qualitative level .",
    "given this qualitative discrepancy and the problem associated with model 1 for description of the two - body ground state of the system @xcite , it is likely that the oversimplification is rooted in the model itself instead of the mean - field approximation .",
    "the quasi-2d geometry can be realized by arranging a one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattice along the axial ( @xmath1 ) direction and a weak harmonic trapping potential in the radial ( @xmath2-@xmath3 ) plane , such that fermions are strongly confined along the @xmath1 direction and form a series of quasi-2d pancake - shaped clouds  @xcite .",
    "each such pancake - shaped cloud can be considered as a quasi-2d fermi gas when the axial confinement is strong enough to turn off inter - cloud tunneling .",
    "the strong anisotropy of trapping potentials introduces two different orders of energy scales , with one characterized by @xmath4 and the other by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) are the trapping frequencies in the axial ( radial ) directions .",
    "the separation of these two energy scales ( @xmath8 ) allows us to first deal with the axial degrees of freedom and derive an effective 2d hamiltonian , and leave the radial degrees of freedom for later treatment .",
    "the effective 2d hamiltonian for model 1 is obtained by assuming that the renormailied atom - atom interaction can be characterized with an effective 2d scattering length , with the latter derived from the exact two - body scattering physics @xcite .",
    "thus , for a wide feshbach resonance where the feshbach - molecule population is negligible , we can write down an effective hamiltonian only in terms of 2d fermionic operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with ( pseudo ) spin @xmath11 and transverse momentum @xmath12 .",
    "the model 1 hamiltonian thus takes the form  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the 2d dispersion relation of fermions with mass @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the chemical potential , and @xmath17 is the quantization area .",
    "the bare parameter @xmath18 is connected with the physical one @xmath19 through the 2d renormalization relation @xmath20^{-1}=\\left [ v_{1p}^{\\text{eff}}\\right]^{-1 } -l^{-2}\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}}\\left ( 2 \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}+\\hbar \\omega_{z}\\right)^{-1}$ ] ( @xmath21 is from the zero - point energy ) , and @xmath22 depends on the 3d scattering length @xmath23 and the characteristic length scale for axial motion @xmath24 with the expression given in ref .  @xcite .",
    "notice that the chemical potential @xmath16 can be a function of the radial coordinate @xmath25 under lda . in the following discussion ,",
    "we choose @xmath4 as the energy unit so that @xmath26 , @xmath18 , and @xmath27 become dimensionless .    by introducing a bcs order parameter ( also dimensionless in unit of @xmath28 ) @xmath29",
    ", we get the zero temperature thermodynamic potential density @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the quasi - particle excitation spectrum .",
    "the ultraviolet divergence of the summation over @xmath32 cancels with the renormalization term in @xmath33^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the gap and number equations can be obtained respectively from @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 is the density of particles ) , leading to @xmath37 notice that eq .",
    "( [ eq : gap1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath38 , where the function @xmath39 absorbs all the dependence on @xmath23 and @xmath40 .",
    "thus , by substituting this expression into eq .",
    "( [ eq : number1 ] ) , we get a closed form for the number equation , @xmath41 .",
    "\\label{eq : number3}\\ ] ] now we take into account the harmonic trapping potential @xmath42 in the radial plane by writing down the position dependent chemical potential @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the chemical potential at the trap center . it can be easily shown that the spacial density profile is now a parabola , @xmath45 , with the thomas - fermi cloud size @xmath46 . by assigning the condition that the total number of particles in the trap is fixed by @xmath47 , the cloud size takes the constant value @xmath48 , which is independent on the 3d scattering length @xmath49 .",
    "in fact , as one varies the scattering length @xmath49 , the chemical potential at the trap center @xmath44 is adjusted accordingly such that the identical density profile is maintained .",
    "this result of a constant cloud size is obviously inconsistent with the picture of a bcs - bec crossover in quasi two dimensions .",
    "in fact , in a typical experiment with @xmath50 ( @xmath51 m ) much greater than the interatomic interaction potential @xmath52 ( @xmath53 nm ) , the scattering of atoms in this quasi-2d geometry is still 3d in nature . in particular ,",
    "fermions will form tightly bound pairs on the bec side of the feshbach resonance as they do in 3d . thus , in the bec limit when fermion pair size @xmath54 and binding energy @xmath55 , the system essentially behaves like a weakly interacting gas of point - like bosons , for which one would expect a vanishing small cloud size in the loosely confined radial plane  @xcite .",
    "the mf result of a finite cloud size in the bec limit from model 1 indicates a finite interaction strength between paired fermions , no matter how small they are in size .",
    "this statement can be extracted directly from the number equation ( [ eq : number3 ] ) , which can be written in the form @xmath56 . in the bec limit ,",
    "the second term on the right - hand side denotes one half of the binding energy , while the first term indicates a finite interaction energy per fermion pair since it is proportional to the number density . as a comparison ,",
    "the actual equation of state for fermion pairs one should expect must take the form as for a quasi-2d bose gas in the weakly interacting limit  @xcite @xmath57 in which case the quasi-2d gas is treated as a 3d condensate with the ground state harmonic oscillator wave function in the @xmath1-direction .",
    "the interaction strength between paired fermions can also be derived by writing down a bose representation for this system , where the fermionic degrees of freedom are integrated out in the bec limit  @xcite .",
    "this bose representation leads to a two - dimensional effective hamiltonian for bosonic field @xmath58 , @xmath59,\\ ] ] where the quartic term characterizes the bosonic interaction . within the stationary phase approximation ,",
    "the interaction strength @xmath60 is calculated by the leading diagram of a four - fermion process with four external boson lines and four internal fermion propagators , leading to  @xcite @xmath61 here , @xmath62 is the boson - fermion vertex , @xmath63 is the fourier transform of the relative wave function @xmath64 of two colliding fermions in the @xmath65-wave channel , and @xmath66 is the free propagator for fermions . after summing over momentum @xmath67 and matsubara frequency @xmath68",
    ", we can directly show that @xmath60 indeed takes a constant value , being independent of the binding energy @xmath69 of paired fermions and hence the 3d scattering parameter @xmath49 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the mf theory based on model 1 fails to recover the picture of a weakly interacting bose gas of paired fermions in the bec limit , and can not be directly applied to describe the bcs - bec crossover in quasi two dimensions .",
    "having shown the problem associated with model 1 , next we consider model 2 by taking into account the axially excited states via inclusion of dressed molecules . as derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effective 2d hamiltonian takes the form ( also in unit of @xmath4 ) , @xmath70 where @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) denotes the creation ( annihilation ) operator for dressed molecules with radial momentum @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 are the 2d effective bare detuning , atom - molecule coupling rate , and background interaction , respectively .",

    "when plotted as functions of the inverse of 3d scattering length @xmath94 , the results for @xmath92li ( solid ) and @xmath93k ( dashed ) are very close , manifesting the near resonance universal behavior .",
    "second , the results from model 1 and model 2 are significantly different , especially on the bec side of the resonance .",
    "in particular , the dressed - molecule fraction in model 2 is already sizable ( @xmath110 ) at unitarity , and becomes dominant on the bec side of the resonance ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : homogeneous]c ) .",
    "this result provides another signature of inadequacy of model 1 , where the dressed - molecule population is always assumed to be negligible .",
    "next , we impose a radial harmonic trap @xmath111 and calculate the thomas - fermi cloud size for a fixed number of particles in the trap @xmath112 , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : rtf ] . the most important feature of fig .",
    "[ fig : rtf ] is that the cloud size given by model 2 ( solid ) is no longer a constant as predicted by model 1 ( dashed ) . on the contrary , by crossing the feshbach resonance , the cloud size decreases from the limiting value @xmath106 of a noninteracting fermi gas in the bcs limit , and approaches to the 3d results ( dotted ) in the bec limit .",
    "this trend successfully recovers the corresponding physics in both the bcs and the bec limits .",

    "considering the fact that there is a scaling relation between @xmath117 and @xmath118 such that the physics is only determined by @xmath119 , this insensitivity with respect to the radial trapping frequency suggests that the experimental measurement has a rather wide range of tolerance on the number of atoms .",
