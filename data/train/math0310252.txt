    "but while the zeros of @xmath0 in an interval could in principle be any finite subset of the interval , the condition that @xmath0 have only real zeros will impose restrictions on the zeros of  @xmath1 .",
    "the main idea of this paper is that if the zeros of @xmath0 lie on a line then the zeros of @xmath1 are more evenly spaced than the zeros of  @xmath0 .",
    "repeated differentiation leads the zeros to become more and more evenly spaced , and under appropriate conditions the zeros will approach equal spacing .",
    "see section  [ sec : longterm ] for precise statements .",
    "there is a long history to the behavior of the zeros of entire functions under repeated differentiation .",
    "polya  @xcite made several interesting conjectures for the case of real entire functions , some of which have only been solved recently  @xcite .",
    "many of those questions concern the reality of zeros of a real entire function , or the motion of zeros toward ( or away from ) the real line when the function is differentiated . in this paper",
    "we take a complementary view and consider the motion along the real line when the function is differentiated .",
    "it is tempting to think of the zeros of @xmath1 as lying close to the midpoint of neighboring zeros of  @xmath0 .",
    "that is a useful model , and we analyze the sequence of midpoints and use it as a tool to study the zeros of the derivative .",
    "a more accurate picture is think of the zeros of  @xmath1 as trying to move as far as possible from the zeros of @xmath0 , and so move toward regions where there are fewer zeros of  @xmath0 .",
    "see figure  [ fig : zfunction ] for an example .",

    "if there are a large number of other zeros near @xmath5 , then @xmath3 will be closer to @xmath4 .",
    "there are several intuitive reasons for this phenomenon .",
    "suppose @xmath4 are the zeros of @xmath0 , listed in increasing order , and consider @xmath6 if @xmath7",
    "then @xmath8 if and only if @xmath9 .",
    "substituting @xmath10 into ( [ fpf ] ) we see two kinds of terms : positive for @xmath11 , and negative for @xmath12 .",
    "if there are many zeros near @xmath5 then all of those negative terms have to be balanced by something .",
    "if there are nt many zeros near @xmath4 , then the only option is moving @xmath13 closer to @xmath4 .",
    "one can think of @xmath14 as a measure of how far the zero of @xmath1 will be from the midpoint .",
    "specifically , @xmath15    an illustrative example is the polynomial @xmath0 with zeros at @xmath16 .",
    "the first zero of the derivative is very close to @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .    a less explicit version of the above explanation uses gauss electrostatic model . by ( [ fpf ] )",
    ", the zeros of @xmath1 can be thought of as points of zero electric field for a collection of equal charges located at  @xmath19 , where like charges repel according to an inverse linear law .",
    "if there is a region of high concentration of charges , then these will push the equilibrium points toward regions of lower charge concentration .",
    "another approach concerns the relationship between the spacing of zeros and the size of the relative maxima and minima of  @xmath0 . roughly speaking",
    ", @xmath0 gets big when there are larger than average sized gaps between zeros .",
    "but since @xmath0 is a polynomial with all zeros on a line , it ca nt change slope too fast .",
    "this forces the locations of the relative maxima to shift around so that the slope of @xmath0 can change appropriately .",

    "[ 1.3 ] , and the dots are the zeros of  @xmath1",
    ". think of the circles as a target , which the zeros of @xmath1 often miss.,title=\"fig : \" ]    this approach is interesting because the current view is that the spacing of zeros is key to understanding the large values of functions like the riemann zeta - function .",
    "in addition to entire functions with zeros on a line , we also consider polynomials with all their zeros on a circle .",
    "we find a close analogy between the two cases .",
    "the motivation here is that much recent work has concerned the connection between @xmath20-functions ( such as the riemann @xmath21-function , which conjecturally have all their zeros on a line ) and the characteristic polynomials of random unitary matrices ( which have all their zeros on the unit circle ) .",
    "the connection between random matrices and @xmath20-functions is discussed extensively in  @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we start with an old result that motivates the remainder of the paper .",
    "we first consider polynomials , and then generalize to entire functions of order  1 .",
    "our main results are stated in section  [ sec : longterm ] . in section  [ midpts ]",
    "we consider a somewhat simpler averaging process which we later will compare to differentiation . in section  [",
    "almost ] we consider the case of zeros which are almost equally spaced , and determine the rate at which differentiation evens out the spacing .",

    "we complete the proof of our main results , and also discuss the case that zeros do not lie on a line .",

    "we can write @xmath35 and so @xmath36 we see that all the zeros of @xmath37 are real because if @xmath38 has positive ( negative ) imaginary part , then each term in the sum has negative ( positive ) imaginary part .",

    "it is obvious that the analogy must break down if pushed too far , for a polynomial has only finitely many zeros . in this section",

    "we find that the discrepancy from equal spacing vanishes exponentially , in sharp contrast to the  @xmath273 of the linear case .",

    "but when @xmath279 the fact that there are only @xmath182 points on a circle comes into play .",

    "suppose @xmath101 is an entire function of order  1 which is real on the real axis , has only real zeros , and the zeros have average spacing  1 .",
    "as we repeatedly differentiate , the zeros will approach equal spacing , and we want to determine the rate at which this occurs .",
    "we will see that the approach to equal spacing is much faster than in the midpoint process of section  [ midpts ] .",
    "we treat in detail the case that the zeros of @xmath0 are close to equally spaced , both on the line and on the circle . at the end of this section",
    "we determine the rate at which differentiation evens out zero spacing .",

    "the zeros of @xmath309 will be approximately halfway between the zeros of @xmath0 , so suppose one of the zeros is @xmath310 .",

    "so , @xmath312 solving for @xmath313 gives the first formula in the theorem .",
    "the @xmath314 error term follows because the above formula shows that @xmath315 , but @xmath316 and @xmath317 , so @xmath318 .    to understand the effect of the second derivative on the zeros",

    "we start with @xmath378 , so in the notation above the discrepancy of @xmath379 and @xmath380 from the average spacing is @xmath381 .",
