    "the number of real solutions to a system of real equations is congruent modulo two to the number of complex solutions , for the simple reason that complex conjugation is an involution which acts freely on the nonreal solutions .",
    "we establish an additional congruence modulo four for certain schubert problems on the grassmannian of @xmath0-planes in the space of polynomials of degree at most @xmath2 , for @xmath3 .",
    "this congruence modulo four was originally observed in a computational experiment when @xmath4 involving the wronski map .",
    "the reason for this congruence is that a natural symplectic structure on this space of polynomials induces an additional geometric involution on this grassmannian which commutes with the wronski map .",
    "this key result ( lemma  [ l : commute ] ) is generalized in a sequel to this paper  @xcite .",
    "this second involution commutes with complex conjugation , and the group they generate consists of the identity and three involutions whose fixed points are , respectively , the real grassmannian , the lagrangian grassmannian , and a twisted real form of the grassmannian , which we call the hermitian grassmannian . the common fixed point locus of this group is the real lagrangian grassmannian , and the congruence modulo four is a consequence of it not forming a hypersurface in the real grassmannian when @xmath3 .",
    "this congruence is a general fact ( lemma  [ l : simple ] ) concerning fibers of a real map that has a second involution , whose fixed point locus has codimension at least two .",
    "it also applies to what we call symmetric schubert problems that have this codimension condition on their lagrangian locus .",
    "while we are unable to characterize which symmetric schubert problems enjoy this condition , we are able to establish this condition for a large class of symmetric schubert problems .",
    "let be a field which will either be the real numbers , , or the complex numbers , .",
    "we write for the @xmath5 dimensional vector space of univariate polynomials of degree at most @xmath6 with coefficients from @xmath7 .",
    "given @xmath8 $ ] , their wronskian is the determinant @xmath9 which is a polynomial of degree at most @xmath10 .",
    "replacing @xmath11 by polynomials @xmath12 with the same linear span will change their wronskian by a constant , which is the determinant of the matrix expressing the @xmath13 in terms of the @xmath14 .",
    "thus the wronskian is a well - defined map @xmath15)\\ \\longrightarrow\\          { \\mbox{\\rm gr}}(1,{{\\mathbb k}}_{mp}[t])\\ = \\ { { \\mathbb p}}({{\\mathbb k}}_{mp}[t])\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the grassmannian of @xmath17-dimensional subspaces of the @xmath7-vector space @xmath18 .",
    "both @xmath19)$ ] and @xmath20)$ ] are algebraic manifolds of dimension @xmath10 , and @xmath21 is a finite map .",
    "when @xmath22 , the degree of the wronski map , which is the number of points in a fiber above a regular value , was shown by eisenbud and harris  @xcite ( based on earlier work of schubert  @xcite ) to be @xmath23 ( schubert determined the degree , and eisenbud and harris proved finiteness . ) in fact , this is the number of points in every fiber , if we count a point weighted by the algebraic multiplicity of the scheme - theoretic fiber at that point . in all of our results ,",
    "the bounds and congruences hold when the points are counted with this multiplicity .",
    "the real version of this , namely studying the real subspaces of polynomials in the fiber above a real polynomial @xmath24 $ ] , has been the subject of recent interest .",
    "this began with the conjecture of boris shapiro and michael shapiro ( _ circa _ 1994 ) , who conjectured that if @xmath25 had all of its roots real , then every ( _ a priori _ ) complex vector space in the fiber @xmath26 would be real .",
    "significant evidence for this conjecture , both theoretical and computational , was found in  @xcite .",
    "eremenko and gabrielov  @xcite proved the conjecture when @xmath27 , and it was proved for all @xmath28 by mukhin , tarasov , and varchenko  @xcite . in their study of this conjecture , eremenko and gabrielov",
    "@xcite calculated the topological degree of the real wronski map , obtaining a nonzero lower bound for the number of real subspaces in the fiber above a general real polynomial of degree @xmath10 , when @xmath29 is odd .",
    "when @xmath29 is even , the topological degree is zero .",
    "when both @xmath0 and @xmath30 are even , they gave a real polynomial of degree @xmath10 with no real preimages under the wronski map  @xcite .",
    "when both @xmath0 and @xmath30 are odd it is not known if there is a nontrivial lower bound on the number of real subspaces in the fibers of the wronski map .",

    "[ th : wronski ] suppose that @xmath31 and @xmath32 . for every @xmath33 $ ] , the number of real points in the fiber @xmath34 is congruent to @xmath35 , modulo four , where each point is counted with its algebraic multiplicity .",
    "since the topological degree of the wronski map @xmath39)\\to{{\\mathbb p}}({{\\mathbb r}}_9[t])$ ] is zero , this corollary shows that the lower bound can be larger than the topological degree .",
