    "one outstanding prediction of the theory of strong interaction ( e.g. @xcite ) , which applies to the evolution of the early universe , is the phase transition from confined hadrons to a deconfined phase of their constituents , the quarks and gluons ( the so called quark gluon plasma = qgp ) .",
    "an experimental program which started approximately in the eighties and continues in many accelerators as : cern sps , bnl rhic and others , has been dedicated to the experimental verification of this transition @xcite .",
    "the main process is nuclear reactions at high energy to achieve a thermalized state with temperature exceeding the critical temperature for the qcd phase transition .",
    "one of the predicted signatures of this change of phase , is an enhancement of strange particles @xcite .",
    "the main idea was a ) the lower threshold for the production of @xmath9 quarks in the qgp through e.g. @xmath10 as compared to the higher threshold for production of strange hadrons in a hadronic reaction for example @xmath11 and b ) the similarity of the mass of the strange quark with the critical temperature @xmath12 , which allows for the equilibration of strange quarks in the qgp .",
    "+ argument a ) holds for all quark flavours , leading to the conclusion that all hadron multiplicities are expected to be increased when produced out of a hadronizing qgp , as compared to hadron production out of a collision which does not pass through the qcd phase transition .",
    "the enhancement can be related in a simple way to phase space @xcite and is flavour dependent .",
    "+ however the argument b ) is true only for the quarks which have mass less or of the order of the critical temperature of approximately 200 mev @xcite .",
    "+ therefore next to the up and down quarks , strange quarks are expected to play a crucial role in identifying the qcd phase transition . in particular , hadrons with @xmath13 and @xmath14 quarks are expected to reflect the critical behaviour of a locally equilibrated phase made up of @xmath15 quarks and gluons",
    ". + heavier flavours like charm and beauty can be affected by the qcd transition in several ways discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "they give important insights e.g. by the experimental measurement of the dissociation temperature of @xmath16 or @xmath17 states which can be at or above the critical one @xcite .",
    "+ therefore , since dissociation of quarkonia may be due to overcritical energy densities , it appears that the critical parameters of the transition can be extracted only through other observables which are sensitive to the transition at the critical energy density and approximately frozen with fast hadronization .",
    "for example fluctuations of several parameters and multiplicities of hadrons which include up , down and strange quarks .",
    "+ in this paper we concentrate on the behaviour of the strange flavour across the qcd phase boundary .",
    "the main point is to interpret the global features of the data ( a+a , @xmath18 , @xmath19 collisions at @xmath6=2 - 1800 gev ) within a strictly thermodynamic approximation , and not to reproduce the data in detail using models outside the validity of thermodynamics .",
    "+ clearly , no perfect global equilibration is reached in these systems which moreover are a mix of several thermodynamic reservoirs e.g. along the rapidity axis .",
    "it appears however that the hadrons in the final state of the colliding systems studied , do not rule out a thermodynamic description .",
    "this is especially the case when a centrality selection has been imposed .",
    "+ preliminary results of part of this work have been shown in @xcite .",
    "+ in section 2 we extract thermodynamic parameters @xmath20 for fixed target au+au collisions at 2 and 4 gev per nucleon and for fixed target pb+pb collisions at 40 gev . in section 3",
    "we estimate the initial energy density reached in the collisions . in section 4",
    "we examine the strangeness suppression factor at non zero chemical potentials as a function of the initial energy density , and find its asymptotic value using nuclear collisions .",
    "in section 5 we extract the temperature at zero chemical potentials and draw the strange border of the qcd phases. we discuss how the critical parameters for the transition are extracted and elaborate on the explanation of several recent experimental puzzles .",
    "we compare the ratios of experimentally measured hadron yields in nuclear collisions with the prediction of a grand canonical ensemble of non interacting free hadron resonances .",
    "we consider the pseudoscalar and vector u , d , s meson nonets as well as the spin 1/2 baryon octet and spin 3/2 decuplet and their antiparticles as well as the @xmath21 or @xmath22 , interpreted as scalar glueball @xcite .",
    "we impose exact conservation of strangeness and correct for the change of final observed hadron yields due to decays of higher lying resonances ( the so called feeding ) .",
    "further details of this model can be found in @xcite .",
    "we extract then the thermodynamic parameters : temperature , baryochemical potential ( @xmath5 ) and strangeness chemical potential ( @xmath23 ) from the model prediction which descibes the data best .",
    "we discuss in the following the production of strangeness relativ to non strange particles extracting the quantity : @xmath24 which is a measure of the strangeness suppression factor defined and used in the literature as @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "+ similar analysis extracting thermal parameters from data , can be found in the literature e.g. @xcite .",
    "for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "+ a main new idea introduced in @xcite and used also in this paper as a tool , is the extrapolation of all thermodynamic states to equivalent states at zero chemical potentials e.g. along isentropic paths . + throughout the paper , all parameters discussed concern the state of hadrons at their chemical freeze - out , that is the time after which the hadron yields do not change anymore through inelastic collisions .",
    "the only exception is the initial energy density which refers to the early state of the system .",

    "we estimate the initial energy density for the collision systems studied in section 2 by taking the nuclear energy density of two overlapping nuclei 2 @xmath33 times the @xmath34 factor of the colliding particles in the center of mass minus one :    @xmath35    with @xmath36 , and @xmath37=0.138 gev/@xmath38 is the normal nuclear matter density .",
    "the value in equation [ gamma ] multiplied by the stopping power gives an estimate of the initial energy density available for heating .",
    "this formula is better suited for low energy data for example ags where the applicability of the bjorken formula @xcite for the energy density calculation is questionable . for a discussion of the systematic error of @xmath3 30 - 50% on the initial energy density calculation for nucleus nucleus and particle collisions",

    "the resulting initial energy densities are :    @xmath39(au+au @xmath6=2.3 gev ) = 0.12 gev/@xmath4 ,    @xmath39(au+au @xmath6=3.3 gev ) = 0.21 gev/@xmath4 ,    @xmath39(pb+pb @xmath6=8.8 gev ) = 1.01 gev/@xmath4 ,",
    "two general comments are important for the understanding of the behaviour of strangeness in particle and nuclear collisions and our later discussion : since collisions of protons and collisions of nuclei at the same energy per nucleon do reach different initial energy densities , it is proper to compare hadronic observables as a function of the initial energy density instead of @xmath6 .",
    "+ it is also a fact that in all investigated colliding systems with a initial nonzero net baryon number , the baryon and strangeness chemical potentials are nonzero and different .",
    "next to the initial baryon number , also the energy of the collisions and hence the stopping influences the baryochemical potential of the final hadrons produced .",
    "therefore the final state of the same nuclei , when colliding at different energy , will be described by a different baryochemical potential . +",
    "this leads to the conclusions that a ) the behaviour of strangeness as a qgp signature can be discussed while comparing systems with the same baryon and strangeness chemical potential and b ) the initial energy density is a better critical parameter than @xmath6 , against which different colliding systems can be compared .",
    "we take these as starting points and study their consequences in the following discussion . + when comparing the strange to non strange particle ratio in nucleus nucleus collisions with p+p collisions at the same energy an enhancement",
    "is seen , which increases with decreasing energy @xcite .",
    "this observation is quantified in figure [ marek ] taken from reference @xcite , which shows the ratio of ( @xmath41 as a function of the variable f which is a function of the @xmath6 of the collision .",
    "the line shows a model prediction from reference @xcite assuming that the phase transition occurs at the vicinity of the maximum .",
    "( for recent literature on the interpretation of data on strangeness see e.g. @xcite . )    in figure [ mub ] the strangeness suppression factor @xmath0 is shown as a function of the initial energy density .",
    "the open stars show nucleus nucleus collision results from the present analysis and the ones from reference @xcite , while the closed stars show results from @xmath18 and @xmath19 collisions from reference @xcite .",
    "the lines shown are linear fits to the data points to illustrate the tendency of the data .",
    "+ the @xmath0 points of all investigated nuclear collisions , define the @xmath0 behaviour at non zero and varying chemical potentials ( the two lines ( @xmath42 ) and ( @xmath43 ) of the upper half of the triangle shown ) .",
    "the horizontal line ( @xmath34 ) going through the @xmath18 and @xmath19 data defines the @xmath0 value at the zero chemical potentials in the @xmath1 region shown .",
    "the @xmath0 factor grows reaching a maximum around @xmath1 @xmath3 1 gev/@xmath38 and then decreases continuously and almost linearly towards an asymptotic value which is defined by the curve with zero chemical potentials of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 data .",
    "therefore it follows that no saturation of the @xmath0 value is reached at energy density between 1 gev/@xmath4 and 8 gev/@xmath4 in nucleus nucleus collisions , as the one indicated in figure [ marek ] .",
    "+ we will argue that the phenomenon of enhancement of the @xmath0 value in nucleus collisions as compared to the @xmath0 values in elementary particle collisions , quantified in figure [ mub ] by the area of the triangle , is mainly due to the difference in the baryochemical potential . + with increasing energy , the central rapidity region in nuclear collisions becomes increasingly net baryon free approaching a state of a nucleus+antinucleus collision .",
    "+ this tendency is shown in figure [ mub ] by the decrease of the line ( @xmath42 ) with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "the statistical significance of the present data does not allow a thorough investigation of the exact shape of the decrease .",
    "in particular in order to find deviations from a linear behaviour , more data are needed .",
    "+ the nonzero potential @xmath0 line ( @xmath42 ) crosses the zero potential @xmath0 horizontal line ( @xmath34 ) at an initial energy density of @xmath3 8 - 9 gev/@xmath4 ( depending on the way we extrapolate e.g. using a linear , exponential or a polynomial distribution ) . the linear fit crosses at 8.25 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "+ this indicates that the limiting value of @xmath0 ( and an almost net baryonfree midrapidity region ) will be achieved at nuclear collisions reaching an initial energy density of @xmath3 8 - 9 gev/@xmath4 . assuming that @xmath1 scales as the logarithm of @xmath6",
    ", we find that the @xmath6 needed to achieve the limiting value of @xmath0 using nucleus nucleus collisions is approximately 3 - 8 tev .",
    "this energy density could therefore be achieved by the large hadron collider at cern .",
    "in the following we discuss the @xmath1 dependence of the @xmath0 factor after extrapolating all thermodynamic states with non zero baryochemical potential to zero , along an isentropic path .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ 0 ] in logarithmic representation ( to show the point of smallest @xmath0 ) , and in figure [ 0_lin ] in linear representation .",
    "all @xmath0 values show a universal behaviour increasing from below until @xmath1 @xmath3 1 gev/@xmath38 and then saturating .",
    "+ several comments can be made : + 1 ) the figure clearly demonstrates that the peak of @xmath0 and of the @xmath7 ratio at 40 a gev pb+pb collisions and their drop towards higher energies , seen in figures [ marek ] and [ mub ] is due to the nonzero baryochemical potential in the collisions .",
    "the @xmath0 factor is the same for pb+pb collisions at 40 and at 158 a gev in figure [ 0 ] ( 4th and 8th points from the left ) .",
    "+ therefore , the so called strangeness suppression phenomenon @xcite , that is , the decrease of the strange to non strange particle ratios ( e.g. @xmath44 ) from 40 gev pb+pb towards 158 gev pb+pb collisions is explained by the different baryochemical potentials of these systems .",
    "+ this interpretation is supported by the difference seen in the @xmath6 dependence of the @xmath45 and the @xmath46 ratio as a function of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in particular it is seen that the peak at 40 a gev pb+pb colisions , appears only in the @xmath45 ratio ( @xmath47 is forced by the high @xmath5 to be abudantly produced in association with @xmath48 ) .",
    "+ 2 ) the increase of the double ratio @xmath7 ( a+a / p+p ) with decreasing @xmath6 discussed e.g. in the review talk @xcite is a natural consequence arising from the above ideas .",
    "+ from this comparison the apparent strangeness enhancement is increasing towards lower energies . however the comparison leading to this conclusion is not taking into account the varying characteristic parameters .",
    "+ 3 ) the @xmath7 ratio is investigated in reference @xcite and shows the above mentioned strangeness suppression with @xmath6 , when constructed using yields of particles in the full phase space acceptance , while it remains constant at midrapidity . +",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the baryochemical potential reaches its lowest value at the midrapidity of nucleus nucleus collisions and the highest one in the forward and backward rapidity regions ( multiple reservoirs ) e.g. @xcite .",
    "therefore , when considering @xmath7 at midrapidity the bias from nonzero @xmath5 is minimized as compared to full acceptance yields .",
    "+ 4 ) the enhancement seen in strange to non strange particle yields in central p+a collisions when compared to p+p at the same energy @xcite , is explained in the same way , since central p+a collisions reach a higher @xmath40 and a higher initial energy density as p+p collisions at the same @xmath6 .",
    "+ 5 ) the strangeness enhancement as defined in the literature ( double ratio of @xmath0 in a+a over p+p collisions at the same @xmath6 ) and as illustrated in figure [ marek ] finds the same explanation . + normalizing to the same @xmath5 value ( here choosen to be zero for simplicity ) and comparing at the same initial energy density , the above mentioned strangeness enhancement dissapears .",
    "+ the @xmath0 factor for particle collisions is within the error compatible with nucleus nucleus collisions as seen in figures [ 0 ] and [ 0_lin ] . + 6 ) enfin : what can we learn from strangeness production about the qcd phase transition ?",
    "+ first , figure [ 0 ] exhibits a very distinct feature of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath1 : @xmath0 is increasing with initial energy density increasing from 0.14 to 1 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "after this @xmath1 value , @xmath0 saturates at a limiting value of @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "+ second , this behaviour is followed universally by all collisions studied .",
    "+ third , @xmath0 is following closely the @xmath1 dependence of the temperature at the chemical freeze out of hadrons ( as shown in figure [ t ] ) .",
    "+ assuming that local equilibrium conditions are reached in all collisions studied , and therefore that temperature is defined , we interpret the dramatic change of the temperature and of @xmath0 at chemical freeze - out near @xmath1 @xmath3 1 gev/@xmath38 , as critical behaviour : the onset of saturation occurs when the critical energy density for the qcd phase transition is reached .",
    "+ the @xmath32 as well as @xmath0 would continue to rise with @xmath1 if no phase transition occurs .",
    "+ a bias in this interpretation is the implicit assumption that @xmath32 does not cool down without noticing the transition due to some peculiar expansion dynamics and its @xmath6 dependence .",
    "however in this case the cooling mechanism should generate the universal behaviour seen in figures [ 0 ] and [ t ] by coincidence .",
    "furthermore , since pressure and expansion characteristics have been measured to be different in different a+a collisions ( e.g. there are strong flow phenomena pointing to high initial pressure in a+a collisions which are more pronounced at rhic than in sps , and not seen in p+p collisions ) it seems difficult to explain a universally flat temperature curve exhibited by all p+p and a+a data , by a non universal expansion dynamics .",
    "+ a phenomenon analogous to the one seen in figure [ t ] is the following : + we fill a box with water and look for the water - vapour phase transition without tools to detect vapour .",
    "each time the transition to vapour ( = qgp ) occurs we thus wait until the vapour condensates back to water ( = hadron gas ) , in order to measure its temperature .",
    "+ we make a plot of the water temperature as a function of the applied heat , and it looks as figure [ t ] , namely it rises and saturates at the value of @xmath50 100@xmath51 celsius .",
    "+ adding salt to water and repeating the experiment would result in different critical values rising with salinity .",
    "+ the baryochemical potential is like salt for hadronic systems . to achieve measuring one single curve one has to use the same salinity , as we do in figures [ t ] and [ 0 ] . as a result",
    ", the border of the qcd phase transition can be drawn and the critical energy density can be extracted selfconsistently from the data , independent of any model predicting where the boundary must be . + the dependence of the temperature on the baryon and strangeness chemical potentials is shown in figures [ t_vs_mub ] and [ t_vs_mus ] .",
    "+ if all these points would lie exactly on the critical border , their extrapolation to equivalent states at zero potentials would lead to one single critical temperature .",
    "+ if all points would not lie on the critical border but well below , their extrapolation to the equivalent states with @xmath5 zero would give scattered temperatures below the critical one , without showing signs of saturation .",
    "+ one could counterargue that the saturation is caused by the freeze out conditions and the critical temperature is never reached in the initial state , ( for example if there is no @xmath52 nearby ) .",
    "+ in this case however the freeze out conditions should change with the collision energy , because the cross sections of particle interactions and the mean free path changes too with @xmath6 .",
    "again saturation is then coincidental . +",
    "a second argument against such coincidence is the following : if the freeze out conditions do imply a universal temperature at chemical freeze out then there should be no variation in the chemical freeze out temperature at zero chemical potentials .",
    "that is the plot of figure [ t ] should be completely flat for all thermal systems . +",
    "a third argument is the similarity of the critical parameters that we extract in the above described picture and in @xcite with the expected critical parameters from qcd ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xcite and from other calculations too e.g. from lattice simulations @xcite ) .",
    "even if the estimation of the initial energy density @xcite has a large inherent error , e.g. in the assumption of a formation time of 1 fm / c , still the error hardly amounts to a factor 7 ( the difference between @xmath1 of tevatron and the @xmath1=1 gev/@xmath4 ) .",
    "also our limiting temperature determination is more reliable than the initial energy density estimate and yet @xmath55 and @xmath2 agree reasonably with each other and with the qcd predictions .",
    "finally we conclude that bjorken s estimate @xcite turns out to be correct .",
    "+ 7 ) it is important to note , that while studing the @xmath0 or the temperature dependence on the initial energy density using their values at non zero chemical potential ( figure [ mub ] ) one can not extract the critical energy density neither the limiting temperature from this study .",
    "+ in particular the values one can extract in this case , simply reflect the fact that we deal with a critical border which is a 2-dimensional surface",
    ". however more data are needed in order to observe this shift .",
    "+ 8) all temperatures achieved with hadrons , are below the critical temperature for sure , however they can approach the border .",
    "we can measure only the approach to the critical surface from the hadronic side , study the way the critical values are approached and extract the critical parameters from critical behaviour .",
    "+ we study the way the systems approach the transition in figures [ rhoe_vs_t ] , [ rhos_vs_t ] , [ rhon_vs_t ] , [ rhoe_to_rhon_vs_t ] , [ rhos_to_rhon_vs_t ] , [ rhos_to_rhoe_vs_t ] , [ rhoe_to_t4_vs_t ] , [ rhos_to_t3_vs_t ] , [ ls_vs_t ] .",
    "+ in figures [ rhoe_to_rhon_vs_t ] and [ rhos_to_rhoe_vs_t ] it is seen that the energy density over the particle density and the entropy density over the energy density show an onset of a critical behaviour at @xmath56 150 mev , while the entropy density over the particle density shown in figure [ rhos_to_rhon_vs_t ] saturates above @xmath56 150 mev . + in figure [ ls_vs_t ] we try to fit the function @xmath57^ { \\alpha}$ ] ( logarithmic critical behaviour ) to the data which go through the qgp phase transition according to figures [ t ] and [ 0 ] ( that is the points with @xmath58 ) , and extract the critical temperature @xmath59 and the critical exponent @xmath60 from the fit .",
    "we find a value for the critical temperature of @xmath61 mev , and an exponent @xmath62 with @xmath29 = 0.059/3 .",
    "this behaviour can not be studied with the precision of a study of the neighbourhood of the curie point in ferromagnets @xcite . +",
    "this value for @xmath59 is in agreement with the qcd expectations for the critical temperature of @xmath63 = 194 @xmath64 18 mev @xcite .",
    "the starting point of this paper is the extraction of thermodynamic parameters describing the final state of au+au collisions at 2 and 4 gev per nucleon and of pb+pb collisions at 40 gev per nucleon .",
    "we extrapolate these parameters to zero chemical potentials along an isentropic path and study the strangeness suppression factor @xmath0 ( @xmath0= @xmath65 ) as a function of the energy density reached early in each collision ( initial energy density @xmath1 ) .",
    "+ we then arrive at the following conclusions : + 1 ) the so called strangeness suppression puzzle , namely the decrease of the @xmath7 ratio ( or equivalently of @xmath0 ) with @xmath6 increasing from its value in pb+pb collisions at 40 a gev , is explained as reflecting the varying chemical potentials of the heavy ion systems .",
    "+ 2 ) several other experimental observations have the same origin : + @xmath66 the increase of the double ratio @xmath7 ( a+a / p+p ) with decreasing @xmath6 .",
    "+ @xmath66 the flatter behaviour of the @xmath7 ratio as a function of @xmath6 when extracted at midrapidity .",
    "+ @xmath66 the difference in the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath45 and @xmath46 ratios .",
    "+ @xmath66 the enhancement seen in strange particles in central p+a collisions as compared to p+p collisions at the same @xmath6 .",
    "+ 3 ) the @xmath0 value of systems with nonzero baryochemical potential is found to approach its limiting value at zero @xmath5 as defined by the @xmath18 and @xmath19 colliding systems .",
    "we estimate that the limiting @xmath0 value ( as well as an approximately net baryon free midrapidity region ) will be reached by nuclear collisions at the initial energy density of @xmath3 8 - 9 gev/@xmath4 , ( corresponding approximately to @xmath6 @xmath3 3 - 8 tev per nucleon+nucleon pair ) probably at the lhc .",
    "+ 4 ) strangeness is not significantly increased in nucleus nucleus collisions as compared to elementary particle collisions , if they are compared 1 ) at the same ( zero ) chemical potential and 2 ) at the same initial energy density .",
    "+ 5 ) however , @xmath0 is found to significantly increase in all systems which reach @xmath1 higher than @xmath67 1 gev/@xmath4 , as compared to all systems below .",
    "strangeness is found to follow closely the temperature , rising until @xmath1 @xmath67 1 gev/@xmath4 and saturating along the border of the qcd phase transition , namely above 1 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "this allows us to extract in a model independent way the critical parameters of the qcd phase transition from the data in particular @xmath68 = 1 @xmath64 0.3 gev/@xmath4 as well as the limiting t and @xmath0 values @xcite .",
    "+ 6 ) having established in figures [ 0 ] , and [ t ] the critical initial energy density for the qcd phase transition of @xmath2 @xmath69 , and determined the systems which go through the qgp phase , we study the way thermodynamic parameters approach the transition point .",
    "+ we find that the systems with @xmath70 , approach @xmath59 = 218 @xmath64 70 mev with a ( logarithmic ) critical exponent @xmath60 = 0.54 @xmath64 0.47 .",
