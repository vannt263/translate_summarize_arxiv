    "oxides in the @xmath2o@xmath0 perovskite family present a multitude of functional properties and are widely renowned for their potential in technological applications .",
    "construction of heteroepitaxial thin films is being actively explored as a route to further enhance and expand on the existing oxide functionalities .",
    "the presence of an interface between an oxide and a substrate can dramatically affect material properties , particularly if a film is grown coherently so that its in - plane lattice constant is forced to match that of the substrate .",
    "the resulting heteroepitaxial strain has been credited , for example , with dramatically enhancing the ferroelectric polarization and curie temperature in thin film batio@xmath0 @xcite and inducing ferroelectricity in usually non - polar srtio@xmath0.@xcite in addition to ferroelectric distortions , we increasingly find repercussions of strain in the patterns of rigid rotations of the corner - sharing @xmath3o@xmath1 octahedral units .",
    "these changes in rotation have been invoked to account for such phenomena as the strain - dependence of magnetic properties , as a result of the corresponding changes in the electronic bandwidth.@xcite in this work , we use density functional theory to examine the effect of epitaxial strain on the rotational instabilities in laalo@xmath0 ( lao ) .",
    "lao is an ideal model system in which to isolate the interplay between strain and rotations because it exhibits only rotational distortions in its ground state with no indications of ferroelectric or jahn - teller instabilities .",
    "we are also motivated by a need to understand the influence of octahedral rotations in oxide heterostructures such as lao / srtio@xmath0 ( sto ) , which has been reported to form a highly conductive electron gas at the interface in spite of the insulating nature of the two parent compounds.@xcite the propagation of octahedral rotations across the interface is likely to be relevant to its electronic properties , but microscopic techniques have limited access to the positions of oxygen ions.@xcite an improved understanding of the effect of strain on the parent compound lao is therefore highly desirable .",
    "= 5.0 cm    = 8.5 cm    here we investigate the effect of biaxial strain in lao .",
    "we find that the bulk @xmath4 structure is destabilized by the constraint of coherent epitaxy and that compressive and tensile biaxial strains greater than @xmath50.2% stabilize previously unidentified phases of lao .",
    "in addition , we find that uniaxial relaxation of the biaxial epitaxial constraint stabilizes a third phase .",
    "the primary structural differences between these strain - stabilized phases and the parent phase are the patterns of octahedral rotations , and our analysis of the transition between them provides insight into the coupling between strain and rotations in lao and similar @xmath2o@xmath0 perovskites .",
    "for all calculations we use the local density approximation ( lda ) of density functional theory as implemented in the vienna _ ab - initio simulation package , vasp.@xcite we use the projector augmented wave method @xcite with the default vasp lda potentials ( la , al , o ) and a plane wave energy cut - off of 800 ev .",

    "we use the notation @xmath9 to denote the pseudocubic ( pc ) lattice constants ( except where noted ) , which correspond to the crystallographic directions [ 100]@xmath10 , [ 010]@xmath10 , and [ 001]@xmath10 . our computational unit cell , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : uc ] , is defined by lattice vectors ( @xmath11 ) , ( @xmath12 ) , and ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "lattice distortions comprised of rigid octahedral rotations are described by the angles of rotation around the pseudocubic axes , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : strain - e ] . for completeness",
    "we also give the glazer notations for our structures , where , e.g. , @xmath16 is written as @xmath17 if consecutive octahedra along @xmath18 rotate in the same direction ( in - phase ) or @xmath19 if consecutive octahedra rotate in the opposite directions ( out - of - phase).@xcite multiple subscripts indicate a compound rotation , e.g. @xmath20 denotes rotation around the @xmath21 axis ( crystallographic direction [ 110]@xmath10 ) .",
    "( note that the @xmath22 are not strictly independent , however a rigorous decomposition made using irreducible representations yields nearly identical results . )",
    "the bulk crystal structure of lao deviates from the ideal @xmath23 perovskite by out - of - phase rotations around the crystallographic [ 111 ] axis ( @xmath24 , glazer system @xmath25 ) that lower the symmetry to space group @xmath4 , and an accompanying rhombohedral distortion .",
    "we reproduce this structure by relaxing lattice parameters and atom positions in our 10-atom unit cell , and calculate a rhombohedral angle of 60.2@xmath26 and an equilibrium lattice constant of @xmath27   ( pseudocubic @xmath28  ) , which underestimates the experimentally determined value by @xmath291% , a common artifact of lda calculations .",

    "we also allow a [ 110]@xmath10  shear of the unit cell .",

    "[ fig : order - params ] . to facilitate fine - sampling near the transition we do not relax @xmath48 in these calculations but instead maintain the equilibrium volume .",
    "later we relax this constraint and find no qualitative changes to the phase diagram .",
    "we find that the shear distortion is only energy - lowering for the @xmath30 phase and all other phases retain @xmath50 90@xmath26 .    at very small strains of -0.2% to 0.1% ,",
    "the ground state is @xmath30 .",
    "the structure exhibits the @xmath24 rotations of the bulk and has a relaxed monoclinic angle @xmath50 90.3@xmath26 . as strain",
    "is increased , the @xmath30 phase becomes rapidly unstable and the system transitions to @xmath39 or @xmath35 , depending on the sign of the strain .",
    "compressive strain greater than -0.2% stabilizes the @xmath35 phase , in which the lattice distortion consists of @xmath15 rotations ( glazer system @xmath37 ) , whereas tensile strain greater than 0.1% stabilizes the @xmath39 phase , comprised of @xmath20 rotations ( @xmath41 ) , as shown in fig .",

    "( note that the precise range of stability for the three ground - state phases is difficult to identify from total energies .",
    "thus we obtain our predicted range of the @xmath30 phase by calculating the zone - center phonons of each phase as a function of strain and comparing the frequencies of the softest non - trivial modes . )    to examine the coupling between strain and rotations , we decompose the distortion from a high - symmetry parent phase with space group @xmath51 in terms of irreducible representations ( or _ irreps _ ) using the software isodisplace.@xcite we find that the dominant irreps are @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which correspond to @xmath15 and @xmath20 rotations , respectively .",

    "we find a roughly linear dependence of rotation angles on lattice parameter .",
    "our results suggest a simple model to describe the response of lao to biaxial strain . in bulk",
    "lao the @xmath24 rotations reduce the bonding distances around the small la cation and minimize the sum of coulombic and repulsive energies , while the dimensions of the octahedra are determined by the strongly covalent al - o bonds.@xcite within this lattice , strain - related changes in lattice spacing are accommodated by changes in either the rotations or the al - o bond lengths . under biaxial strain ,",
    "we find two distinct responses within the range of strains investigated , as seen in the evolution of al - o distances and octahedral rotations , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : order - params ] . at very small values of strain ( -0.2% to 0.1% ) the changes in lattice dimensions",
    "are accommodated primarily by rotations while al - o distances remain nearly constant , and the system remains in the @xmath30 phase . under compressive ( tensile ) strain , transformation to @xmath35 ( @xmath39 )",
    "occurs when @xmath20 ( @xmath15 ) goes to zero .",
    "increased strain is then accommodated by changes to al - o distances , while the rotations remain nearly constant .",
    "we note that the precise values of strain at which the phase transformations are predicted to occur are dependent on very small energy differences and are therefore somewhat sensitive to the computational parameters used . for example , test calculations performed using the generalized gradient approximation for the exchange - correlation energy indicated small variations in the quantitative details of the phase diagram but the qualitative model does not change significantly .",
    "= 8.0 cm    similar strain - induced variations in tilt patterns have recently been reported in a number of other perovskite oxides , including srruo@xmath0,@xcite bifeo@xmath0,@xcite and lanio@xmath0.@xcite the behavior of lao is distinct from these systems , however , in the extremely narrow window in which the parent phase is stable and the dramatically different structures stabilized by compressive and tensile strain .",
    "we next examine the effect of a uniaxial relaxation of tensile strain in lao . we compare the energetics of @xmath20 rotations ( @xmath39 phase ) to a phase with only @xmath16 rotations ( space group @xmath43 ) . under biaxial strain ,",
    "the @xmath43 phase is @xmath290.5 mev higher in energy than @xmath39 in the range of strains investigated , but a uniaxial relaxation of the strain , such that @xmath54 , alters the balance of energy between the two .",
    "starting with atom configurations from the relaxed structures for @xmath55 , we vary the ratio @xmath56 and calculate the total energy for the two phases . we maintain a constant in - plane area @xmath21 and do not relax @xmath48 .",
    "we first explore the system with @xmath57 ( 3.746 )@xmath58 and find that a 0.5% distortion of @xmath56 stabilizes @xmath16 rotations relative to @xmath20 by @xmath291 mev .",
    "we compare this to the system with @xmath57 ( 3.85 )@xmath58 , @xmath293% tensile strain , and find that the uniaxial relaxation is no longer energetically favorable , and the ground - state retains @xmath20 rotations and @xmath55 .",
    "our results indicate that lao films on substrates with a lattice mismatch of @xmath290.5% may , in theory , lower their energy through a partial relaxation such that @xmath54 .",
    "the resulting structure exhibits @xmath16 rotations ( for @xmath59 ) in the space group @xmath43 . in practice",
    ", no common growth substrate provides these conditions , but the result is likely to be a general phenomenon in similar materials .",
    "the data suggest an explanation for the experimental observation of @xmath60 in some coherent films grown on square substrates .",
    "for example , bifeo@xmath0 films thinner than 50 nm grown on lao substrates are reported to have @xmath613.84   and @xmath623.76  , compared to the substrate parameters @xmath63  , indicating a uniaxial relaxation of the epitaxial constraint.@xcite our results for lao at 3% tensile strain , which do not predict a uniaxial strain relaxation , are consistent with experimental data for films of lao on sto ( a mismatch strain of 3% ) .",

    "finally , we address the effect of manually disabling octahedral rotations . for this we treat a five - atom tetragonal unit cell in which rotation of the oxygen octahedra is forbidden by symmetry . at each value of epitaxial strain",
    "we relax the positions of the ions and calculate the electric polarization using the berry phase method.@xcite we find that , while the unstrained system is non - polar , an abrupt transition to a state with large polarization occurs at -3% strain .",
    "the polarization is out - of - plane and results from a structural distortion within @xmath51 symmetry in which al and la displace along [ 001 ] . a compressive strain of 4% results in a polarization of 38 @xmath65c @xmath66 relative to a centrosymmetric reference structure .",
    "these results indicate the existence of an incipient ferroelectric mode that is usually suppressed by the dominant antiferrodistortive rotational modes .",
    "in summary , we find that several different phases of lao , characterized by distinct patterns of octahedral rotations , can be stabilized by varying the epitaxial constraints over a range that is readily accessible experimentally .",
    "this remarkable structural softness indicates that it is unlikely that the bulk - type @xmath24 rotations will be observed in heteroepitaxial thin films of lao on any substrate .",
    "this has important implications for the interpretation of structural data for lao films , with particular relevance to investigations of the properties of lao / sto interfaces .",
    "we find that biaxial strain of -0.2% to 0.1% results in large changes in octahedral tilt angles in the bulk - like @xmath30 phase of lao .",
    "larger strains , however , induce a tilt - driven transition to one of three phases in which at least one tilt component is zero ( @xmath35 , @xmath39 , or @xmath43 ) . within these strained phases , we find that changes in lattice parameters related to epitaxial strain are largely accommodated by changes in the al - o bond lengths , with only small changes to tilt angles , and without any significant effect on electronic properties .",
    "these findings provide insight to the growing list of complex oxide perovskites in which the rotational distortions are observed to depend on lattice parameters .",
    "given the coupling between rotations and strain in lao , and its non - polar structure , we propose it as a model system for exploring new non - linear optical techniques for probing octahedral rotations.@xcite    finally , for small values of tensile strain we find that a uniaxial relaxation of the strain , such that @xmath67 , stabilizes @xmath16 rotations over @xmath20 .",
    "our results suggest a route to selectively stabilize different tilt patterns via the substrate geometry .",
    "conversely , these results also suggest an explanation for the unequal in - plane lattice parameters observed in some epitaxial thin films of perovskites , in which similar energetics of @xmath16 and @xmath20 rotations may drive a distortion of @xmath56 .",
