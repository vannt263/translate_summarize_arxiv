    "the apparent acceleration of our universe is one of the most striking cosmological observations of recent times . in the context of friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw )",
    "models in general relativity , the acceleration of our universe would require either the presence of a cosmological constant or a new form of matter ( `` dark energy '' ) with large negative pressure",
    ". however , since there does not appear to be any natural explanation for the presence of a cosmological constant of the necessary size , nor does there appear to be any natural candidate for dark energy , it is tempting to look for alternative explanations . in recent years",
    ", there have been at least two approaches that have attempted to account for the observed acceleration of our universe within the framework of general relativity as being a consequence of deviations of our universe from exact flrw symmetry , without invoking the presence of a cosmological constant or dark energy .",
    "one approach notes that the mass density of our universe is , in fact , extremely inhomogeneous on scales much smaller than the hubble radius . in order to get an effective homogeneous , isotropic universe",
    ", one needs to average and/or smooth out the inhomogeneities on some appropriate choice of spatial slicing .",
    "in such an `` averaged '' ( or effective ) flrw universe , one can then define `` effective cosmological parameters ''  @xcite .",
    "one then finds that the equations of motion for these effective cosmological parameters differ , in general , from the equations satisfied by these parameters in flrw models .",
    "if they differ in a way that corresponds to adding a cosmological constant ( or dark energy ) of the right magnitude , then one may hope to have explained the acceleration of our universe in the context of general relativity , without invoking the presence of a cosmological constant or dark energy  @xcite .",
    "a second approach has attempted to account for the acceleration of our universe as a back - reaction effect of long - wavelength cosmological perturbations .",
    "here one constructs an `` effective energy - momentum tensor '' for these perturbations from second - order perturbation theory , and adds this as a source term in einstein s equation  @xcite .",
    "if this effective energy - momentum tensor has a form similar to that of a cosmological constant ( or , at least , provides a negative pressure term ) and is of the appropriate magnitude , then one may hope that this could explain the acceleration of our universe .",
    "given that our universe appears to be very accurately described by a flrw model , with very small deviations from homogeneity and isotropy , it would seem extremely implausible that cosmologically important effects could result from the second ( or higher ) order corrections produced by these small departures from a flrw model .",
    "the main purposes of this paper are to explain this point with somewhat more precision and to point out some significant flaws in the arguments that have been made in the context of the above two approaches .",
    "in particular , we emphasize that one can not justify a model by merely showing that spatially averaged quantities behave the same way in flrw models with acceleration ; rather one must show that _ all _ of the predictions of the model are compatible with observations .",
    "we illustrate this point by showing that spatial averaging can yield `` acceleration '' for the case of a universe that consists of two disconnected components , each of which is decelerating !",
    "we also show that spatial averaging can yield acceleration for suitably chosen slices of minkowski spacetime . with regard to the back - reaction effects of long - wavelength perturbations , we note that the effective energy - momentum tensor is highly gauge dependent , as has previously been pointed out by unruh  @xcite . even in the long - wavelength limit ,",
    "we show that one can get essentially any answer one wishes for the effective energy - momentum tensor , even though one can not get any new physical phenomena beyond those already present in flrw models .",
    "we also emphasize the difference between the use of an effective energy - momentum tensor for gravitational perturbations in the context of second - order perturbation theory and the use of a similar effective energy - momentum tensor in the context of the `` shortwave approximation''@xcite .",
    "the former is highly gauge dependent ( and , thus , not easily interpreted ) and must be `` small '' if higher order perturbative corrections are to be neglected .",
    "the latter is essentially gauge independent and need not be `` small . ''",
    "however , the `` shortwave approximation '' clearly is not valid for analyzing long - wavelength cosmological perturbations .    in the next section ,",
    "we point out that our universe appears to be very accurately described on all scales by a newtonianly perturbed flrw metric , despite the presence of large density contrasts .",
    "if this is correct , then higher order corrections to this metric resulting from inhomogeneities would be negligible .",
    "thus , any model that attempts to explain the acceleration of our universe as a consequence of higher order effects of inhomogeneities will have to overcome the seemingly impossible burden of explaining why the universe appears to be so well described by a model that has only very small departures from a flrw metric . in section 3",
    ", we illustrate that spatial averaging can produce an entirely spurious `` acceleration '' that is not associated with any physical observations . in section 4",
    ", we emphasize the distinction between second - order perturbation theory and the shortwave approximation , and we analyze the gauge dependence of the effective energy - momentum tensor arising in second - order perturbation theory .",

    "we assume the metric @xmath1 to be a flat spatial metric , i.e. , @xmath12 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the above discussion does _ not _ constitute a _ derivation _ that a metric form , eq .  ( [ metric : newton - flrw ] ) , is a good approximation to a solution to einstein s equation for stress - energy eq .",

    "( [ ts ] ) and ( [ tm ] ) , then eqs .",
    "( [ einstein : tt ] ) , ( [ einstein : ij ] ) and ( [ eq : poisson ] ) must hold .",
    "the above discussion is thus analogous to the usual textbook `` derivations '' of the ordinary newtonian limit of general relativity , where one also postulates a spacetime metric of a suitable `` newtonian form '' and assumes that the matter distribution is approximately of the form ( [ tm ] ) ( see , e.g. , section 4.4a of @xcite ) .",
    "one can derive the ordinary newtonian limit more systematically by considering one - parameter families of solutions to einstein s equation with suitable limiting properties ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "it would be more difficult to provide an analogous analysis here , but we see no reason to doubt that eq .",

    "we now assert that the metric , eq .",
    "( [ metric : newton - flrw ] ) , appears to very accurately describe our universe on _ all scales _ , except in the immediate vicinity of black holes and neutron stars .",
    "the basis for this assertion is simply that the flrw metric appears to provide a very accurate description of all phenomena observed on large scales , whereas newtonian gravity appears to provide an accurate description of all phenomena observed on small scales .",
    "the metric ( [ metric : newton - flrw ] ) together with eqs  ( [ condi : newtonian ] ) , predicts that large scale phenomena will be accurately described by a flrw model , whereas the metric ( [ metric : newton - flrw ] ) together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : poisson ] ) predicts that newtonian gravity will hold in regions small compared with the hubble radius in which the stress - energy ( [ tm ] ) dominates over ( [ ts ] ) ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note that the validity of eq .",
    "( [ metric : newton - flrw ] ) for accurately describing phenomena on _ small _ scales holds despite the fact that the density contrast of matter is commonly quite large  @xcite 1 . indeed , for the solar system , galaxies , clusters of galaxies",

    "( [ condi : newtonian ] ) also hold . even for neutron stars , @xmath15 , so the metric eq .",
    "( [ metric : newton - flrw ] ) is probably not too bad an approximation even in the vicinity of neutron stars .",
    "the key point of this section is that if our assertion is correct that a metric of the form of eq .",
    "( [ metric : newton - flrw ] ) accurately describes our universe , and if it also is true that conditions ( [ condi : newtonian ] ) hold , then the nonlinear correction terms occurring in eqs .",
    "( [ einstein : tt ] ) and ( [ einstein : ij ] ) are negligibly small .",
    "it therefore is manifest that nonlinear corrections , one enters a `` nonlinear regime . ''",
    "this might suggest that the validity of eqs .",
    "( [ metric : newton - flrw ] ) and/or ( [ eq : poisson ] ) would be questionable whenever @xmath16 .",
    "however , this is not the case ; the proper criteria for the validity of the metric eq .",
    "( [ metric : newton - flrw ] ) are conditions ( [ condi : newtonian ] ) , not @xmath17 .",
    "it is true that nonlinear effects become important for the motion of matter when @xmath16 .",
    "this follows simply from the fact that self - gravitation is a nonlinear effect , and self - gravitational effects on the motion of matter can not be ignored when @xmath18 .",
    "but this does not mean that one must include nonlinear corrections to the metric form , eq .",
    "( [ metric : newton - flrw ] ) , or to eq .",
    "( [ eq : poisson ] ) in order to get a good approximation to the spacetime metric . indeed ,",
    "if one is trying to describe the solar system in the context of the ordinary newtonian limit of general relativity , one must include `` nonlinear effects '' to obtain the correct motion of the planets ; they would move on geodesics of the flat metric rather than the newtonianly perturbed metric if not for these `` nonlinear effects . ''",
    "however , the corrections to the spacetime metric of the solar system arising from nonlinear terms in einstein s equation are entirely negligible . ] to the dynamics of the universe will be negligible , i.e. , there will be no important `` back - reaction '' effects of the inhomogeneities on the observed expansion of the universe on large scales .",
    "in particular , accelerated expansion can not occur if the smoothly distributed matter satisfies the strong energy condition . however , our assertion that the metric , eq .",
    "( [ metric : newton - flrw ] ) , very accurately describes our universe is merely an assertion , and we can not preclude the possibility that other models ( e.g. , with large amplitude , long - wavelength gravitational waves or with matter density inhomogeneities of a different type ) might also fit observations .",
    "our main point of this paper , however , is that if one wishes to propose an alternative model , then it is necessary to show that all of the predictions of this model are compatible with observations such as the observed redshift - luminosity relation for type ia supernovae and the various observed properties of the cosmological microwave background ( cmb ) radiation . as we shall illustrate in the next two sections",
    ", it does not suffice to show merely that the spatially averaged scale factor behaves in a desired way or that an effective stress - energy tensor is of a desired form .",

    "( [ einstein : tt ] ) and ( [ einstein : ij ] ) above is not problematical .",

    "we `` time evolve '' @xmath22 by making it be comoving with the dust , i.e. , the ( comoving ) coordinates of the boundary of @xmath22 remain constant with time .",

    "indeed , we have _ d = _ d+ _ d - _ d_d , where @xmath32 denotes the expansion of the world lines of the dust .    it is immediately seen from ( [ eq : evolve ] ) that `` averaged acceleration '' @xmath33 is achieved if q_d > _ d. [ condi : acceleration ] buchert  @xcite has discussed cosmological implications of the condition ( [ condi : acceleration ] ) .    a number of authors ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) have sought to account for the observed acceleration of our universe by means of inhomogeneous models that satisfy eq .",
    "( [ condi : acceleration ] ) . however , our main point of this section is that even if our universe ( or a suitable spatial domain of our universe ) satisfies eq .",
    "( [ condi : acceleration ] ) and thus has @xmath34 , this does _ not _ imply that the model will possess any physically observable attributes of an accelerating flrw model .",
    "indeed nambu and tanimoto  @xcite have shown that in a cosmological model in which @xmath22 can be written as a union of regions each of which is locally homogeneous and isotropic , we have a_d^2 = a_1 ^ 2a_1 + a_2 ^ 2a_2 + + _ ij a_i^3a_j^3 ( - ) ^2 , [ nt ] where @xmath35 denotes the locally defined scale factor in the @xmath36-th patch , and , in this case , @xmath37 .",
    "consider , now , a model where at time @xmath21 the universe consists of two disconnected ( ! ) dust filled flrw models , one of which is expanding and the other of which is contracting .",
    "both components of the universe are , of course , decelerating , i.e. , @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "nevertheless , it is not difficult to see from eq .",
    "( [ nt ] ) that @xmath40 can easily be satisfied .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath41 and @xmath42 we obtain a_d^2 a_d = 2a^3 \\ { + 4()^2 } = ^2 a^3 > 0 .",
    "we thereby obtain a very simple model where the universe is accelerating according to the definition eq .",
    "( [ condi : acceleration ] ) , but all observers see only deceleration .",
    "this graphically illustrates that satisfaction of eq .",
    "( [ condi : acceleration ] ) in a model is far from sufficient to account for the physically observed effects of acceleration in our universe .",
    "we see no reason to believe that the spatially averaged acceleration found , e.g. , in the models of @xcite directly corresponds to any physical effects of acceleration such as would be observed in type ia supernovae data . the only way to tell if a model displays physically observable effects of acceleration is to calculate these effects .    as already mentioned above , the averaging procedure defined by eq .",
    "( [ def : averaging ] ) also has ambiguities both with regard to the choice of time slicing and the choice of domain @xmath22 .",
    "one may also artificially produce an averaged cosmic acceleration as a result of a suitably chosen time - slicing . to show this explicitly , we give an example of accelerated expansion in minkowski spacetime . we note first that for a general inhomogeneous universe ( i.e. , with no assumption concerning the form of the stress - energy ) , the equation of motion for @xmath28 can be expressed as 3 = - _ d - 6 ( ) ^2 + ( g_ab + g_abg^c_c)t^at^b _ d , [ average : acceleration ] where @xmath43 denotes the einstein tensor .",
    "therefore , for any vacuum spacetime , if there is a domain @xmath22 such that @xmath44 , then @xmath22 describes an accelerated expansion insofar as @xmath28 is concerned .    to construct an accelerating @xmath22 in minkowski spacetime",
    ", we start with two hyperboloidal slices , one of which corresponds to an expanding time - slice in the milne chart covering the future of the origin ds^2 = -da^2 + a^2 ( d^2 + ^2 d^2 ) , and the other of which is a similar hyperboloidal slice that is contracting .",
    "the idea of the construction is to join these two hyperboloids at some radius , smooth out the join region , and choose @xmath22 so that @xmath45 ( see figure [ fig : accele - slicing ] ) . since the hyperboloids have negative scalar curvature , we thereby have @xmath46 except near the radius where the hyperboloids are joined .",
    "however , we can show that this construction can be done so that the contribution from the join region can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "consequently , we obtain @xmath47 . details of this construction are given in the appendix .",
    "since minkowski spacetime does not display any physical effects associated with accelerated expansion , this example shows quite graphically that `` acceleration '' as defined by the above averaging procedure can easily arise as a gauge artifact produced by a suitable choice of time slicing .",

    "a number of authors have considered the back - reaction effects of perturbations of flrw models , particularly with regard to modes whose wavelength is comparable to or larger than the hubble radius  @xcite .",
    "the basic strategy has been to compute the second order terms in einstein s equation arising from these perturbations , thereby obtaining an `` effective stress - energy tensor '' for the perturbations .",
    "if the form of this effective stress - energy tensor corresponds to that of a positive cosmological constant of the correct magnitude , then one might hope to have provided a mechanism for obtaining the observed acceleration of our universe as a back - reaction effect of long - wavelength perturbations , without the need to introduce a cosmological constant or dark energy .",
    "we comment , first , that , even without extensive analysis , there is an intrinsic implausibility to this type of explanation .",
    "if one considers perturbations of wavelength less than the hubble radius , it is hard to imagine that the perturbations could be so small that we do not notice any significant deviations from homogeneity and isotropy , yet so large that their _ second order _ effects produce very significant changes to the dynamics of our universe .",
    "on the other hand , if one goes to the long - wavelength limit , then the perturbation should correspond closely to a perturbation to a spatially homogeneous cosmological model .",
    "but , given the severe constraints on anisotropy arising from cmb observations , the perturbation should , in fact , correspond to a perturbation towards another flrw model .",
    "thus , one should not be able to obtain any new phenomena ( such as acceleration without a cosmological constant or dark energy ) that are not already present in flrw models .",
    "at least part of the confusion with regard to the calculation of the back - reaction effects of cosmological perturbations appears to stem from the fact that the notion of an `` effective stress - energy tensor '' for perturbations arises in two quite different contexts , namely ( i ) ordinary perturbation theory and ( ii ) the `` shortwave approximation .

    "we now explain this distinction . for simplicity , we restrict consideration in the following discussion to the vacuum case ; cosmological perturbations for the einstein - scalar - field system",
    "will be considered later in this section .",
