    "in this paper , we analyze symmetric mixed states ( hereafter `` mixed state '' ) on a sparsely encoded associative memory model .",
    "when an associative memory model is made to store memory patterns as a result of correlation learning , a pattern , which is a nonlinear superposition of the stored memory patterns using a neuron output function , automatically becomes the equilibrium state of the model .",
    "this is called the mixed state .",
    "it is not appropriate to think that this mixed state is a side - effect and/or that is unnecessary for information processing .",
    "amari has discussed a `` concept formation '' using the stability of mixed state @xcite .",
    "the correlated attractor proposed in @xcite , which is a model of the miyashita attractor @xcite , is considered to be a ( not symmetric ) mixed state in a broad sense .",
    "recently , parga and rolls have used the mixed state as a mechanism of invariant recognition under a coordinate transformation @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the sparse coding scheme is believed to be used in the brain according to some physiological findings @xcite and the theoretical viewpoints @xcite .",
    "thus , the properties of the mixed states on the sparsely encoded associative memory model should be discussed .",
    "this is the main purpose of the present paper .",
    "@xmath1 is the mixed state in a model storing memory pattern @xmath2 , with the output function @xmath3 and threshold value @xmath4",
    ". therefore @xmath5 types of mixed state can be composed of @xmath5 memory patterns by changing the threshold value .",
    "@xmath6 among the @xmath5 types is regarded as the mixed state in a model with the output function @xmath3 that is made to learn memory patterns of a @xmath7 firing rate @xcite .",
    "in other words , a `` typical '' mixed state is a state of the majority decision for the firing or non - firing elements among the @xmath5 types of the mixed state .",
    "a natural question then arises : what kind of mixed state among the @xmath5 types should be considered typical in the sparse limit of @xmath8 ? ( @xmath9 is the firing rate of the memory pattern ) . in the sparsely encoded model ,",
    "storage capacity strongly depends on the threshold value , so that an appropriate setting of the threshold value makes the storage capacity diverge at @xmath10 in the sparse limit @xcite .",
    "thus , in this study , `` typical '' mixed state is defined as the mixed state with similar properties to the memory pattern for the storage capacity and the threshold value .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss which mixed state in the sparse limit should be regarded as a typical mixed state .",
    "first , three out of @xmath5 types of the mixed state are considered : the or mixed state , the majority decision mixed state , and the and mixed state .",
    "each element of the or mixed state is taken from the or operation in the boolean sense for each element of memory patterns composing of the mixed state .",
    "the other two types are similarly defined .",
    "the examination of the stability of each mixed state by the self - consistent signal - to - noise analysis ( scsna ) proposed by shiino and fukai @xcite and the computer simulation shows that the storage capacity of the or mixed state diverges as @xmath11 , but the storage capacities of the other two types do not diverge .",
    "this can be explained as follows : the overlap of the majority decision mixed state with the stored memory pattern and the overlap of the and mixed state with the stored memory pattern converge at @xmath12 in the sparse limit , whereas the overlap of the or mixed state with one converges at @xmath13 .",
    "likewise , while the optimum threshold value that maximizes the storage capacity of the memory pattern or the or mixed state settles at the same value , the optimum threshold value of the majority decision mixed state and the and mixed state does not agree with the optimum threshold value of the memory pattern in the sparse limit .",
    "therefore , the important factors to decide the storage capacity and the optimum threshold value in the sparse limit are asymptotes for the overlaps of the @xmath5 types of the mixed state with the memory patterns .",
    "besides three typical mixed states , we also evaluate the overlaps of the @xmath5 types of the mixed states to show that all the overlaps of the @xmath14 kinds of mixed states except for the or mixed states converge to @xmath12 in the sparse limit .",
    "thus , we conclude that a consideration of the or mixed state as a typical mixed state in the sparse coding is appropriate .    at the end of this paper",
    ", we discuss the recently reported physiological findings of sugase et al .",
