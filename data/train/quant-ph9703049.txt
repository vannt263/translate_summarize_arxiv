    "rabi flopping is a well known phenomenon : if a two - level atom with energy levels @xmath1 and @xmath2 is under the action of a monochromatic electromagnetic field , which we assume for simplicity to be resonant , then the state vector of the atom oscillates between the lower and upper state with the rabi frequency which depends on the amplitude of the driving field . speaking",
    "more precisely , the probability for the atom to be , say , on the level @xmath1 oscillates sinusoidally between 1 and 0 .",
    "whenever a von neumann (  instantaneous \" and perfect ) measurement of energy is made at a certain time , the measurement result is either @xmath1 or @xmath2 with the probability depending on the time when the measurement is performed , in accordance with this sinusoid .",
    "the atom is after the measurement in the energy eigenstate corresponding to @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "this means that such a measurement disturbs the rabi oscillation radically : the phase of the rabi flopping during next period is determined by the result of the von neumann measurement .",
    "it is also well known that if perfect measurements of energy of the atom ( von neumann measurements ) are very frequent and in the limit continuous , the interaction with the measuring apparatus prevents atomic transitions between levels .",
    "the atom stays in an eigenstate and the readout of the continuous perfect measurement reduces to the constant value @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "this is the often discussed quantum zeno effect @xcite which has been verified experimentally @xcite .",
    "it is impossible in this regime of measurement to obtain information about the rabi oscillation .",
    "moreover , the rabi oscillation is prevented by the measurement because the influence of the measurement on the atom is stronger than the influence of the driving field .",
    "in contrast to this we want to address in the following the fundamental question if it is nevertheless possible to make the rabi oscillation  visible \" by _ continuous _ measurement of the atomic energy , i.e. to obtain a correlation between the measurement readout @xmath0 and the rabi oscillation of the state vector . to achieve our goal",
    "we must first of all avoid the zeno effect by weakening the influence of the measurement .",
    "this can be done with the help of continuous measurements which are fuzzy ( unsharp ) instead of being perfect ( sharp ) .",
    "a _ fuzzy _ ( unsharp ) measurement is caused by the low resolution of the respective detector . in the case of an observable with a discrete spectrum fuzziness",
    "means that the measurement is not able to transfer the state of the system to an eigenvector .",
    "fuzziness does not go back to a defect detector , but to its finite resolution . note that in practice a fuzzy measurement is the generic case and that a sharp or perfect measurement may be considered only as an idealization .",
    "the study of continuous fuzzy measurements opens a very interesting new field in which fundamental problems of quantum theory as well as potentially important concrete applications are discussed .",
    "there are physical situations in which we have to rely on fuzzy measurements if we want to obtain relevant information @xcite .",
    "the theory of continuous quantum measurements has a long history .",
    "an incomplete list of references is @xcite .",
    "the majority of authors studying continuous quantum measurements base their investigations on particular micro - models for the measuring device , see @xcite for the measurement of the energy of a two - level system .",
    "as compared to this the phenomenological and therefore model - independent approach presented below has the big advantage that the universal structures of the theory of continuous measurements can be revealed , including those connected with fuzziness .",

    "it has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the approach has already been applied to the measurement of energy in @xcite .",
    "however , an _ ad hoc _ assumption was made in @xcite that the measurement readout is a constant curve @xmath3 .",
    "this is too restrictive and misleading for a continuous fuzzy measurement .    a theory of continuous fuzzy measurements ( say , monitoring some observable has to answer the following questions : how can the type and strength of fuzziness be represented theoretically and what will be the characteristic parameters ?",
    "let the measurement of the observable @xmath4 be of duration @xmath5 , what is the probability to obtain the measurement readout @xmath6 = \\{a(t)|0\\le t \\le t\\}$ ] ?",

    "we obtain as a characteristic property of a continuous fuzzy measurement that its resolution improves with increasing duration @xmath5 as @xmath9 .",
    "this reflects a zeno - type influence which is still present even if it does not result in the proper zeno effect .    in sect .",

    "different durations @xmath5 and the corresponding regimes of measurement are discussed .",
    "the time after which neighboring levels are resolved is called the level resolution time @xmath10 .",
    "its shortness is a measure for the strength of a zeno - type influence (  level freezing \" ) present in the continuous fuzzy measurement .",

    "an output of an instantaneous measurement is a number .",

    "fuzziness of the continuous measurement depends on the fuzziness of the instantaneous measurements and on the intervals between them .",
    "we give three examples :    \\1 .",
    "the most obvious approach is to make a continuous sharp measurement fuzzy in making the underlying instantaneous measurements fuzzy , in other words , to modify measurements leading to the quantum zeno effect in this way .",
    "an arrangement for the zeno effect was suggested in @xcite and used in @xcite .",
    "a system ( ion in a trap ) consisting of levels 1 and 2 is driven between these levels by a resonant perturbation .",
    "there is a subsidiary level 3 that can decay only to level 1 .",
    "the state measurement is carried out by action of an optical pulse in resonance between levels 1 and 3 .",
    "this pulse can induce the @xmath212 transition with the subsequent spontaneous return to level 1 accompanied by the emission of a photon with the same frequency .",
    "it causes a projection of the ion onto level 1 accompanied by scattering the photon .",
    "this happens with the probability @xmath213 if the initial state of the ion is @xmath214 . with the probability",
    "@xmath215 the pulse projects the ion onto level 2 with no scattering .",
    "the measurement of this type is sharp ( of von neumann type ) and answers the question whether the ion is on level 1 .",
    "frequent repetition of this measurement was shown @xcite to lead to the quantum zeno effect freezing the atom on level 1 .",
    "each measurement in a series completely resolves in this case between the energy levels , i.e. is not fuzzy .",
    "it is necessary to modify the experimental setup to realize a fuzzy measurement of energy .    to do this",
    ", one may choose an ion with very fast decay of the subsidiary level 3 to both main levels 1 and 2 and a continuous spectrum of the radiation inducing the transitions @xmath212 and @xmath216 . the width of level 3 and the width of the spectrum of the inducing radiation have to be more than the difference @xmath82 between levels 1 and 2 .",
    "the induced transition from levels 1 and 2 to the subsidiary level 3 with the subsequent spontaneous transition back to the same level will be accompanied by elastic scattering of a photon .",
    "measuring the frequency of the scattered photon is equivalent in these conditions to an instantaneous fuzzy measurement of energy ( performed with the resolution worse than @xmath82 ) .",
    "a series of scatterings is then a continuous fuzzy measurement of energy .",
    "resolution of the continuous measurement @xmath217 depends on the length of the series or duration @xmath5 of the continuous measurement .",
    "special precaution should be taken in this scheme to provide that only transitions @xmath218 and @xmath219 might occur .",
    "for this , level 3 may be double , consisting of two very close levels @xmath220 and @xmath221 with the only transitions @xmath222 and @xmath223 permitted .",
    "an electron in a magnetic field is a two - level system and repeated measurements of its energy can be performed with the help of several stern - gerlach ( sg ) devices .",
    "the position of the electron after scattering in the sg device depends on its energy . therefore measuring the final position of the electron is in fact measuring its energy .",
    "if the initial position is uncertain to some degree , the resulting measurement of energy is fuzzy . in fixing the initial uncertainty ,",
    "we can determine the fuzziness of the instantaneous measurement of energy .",
    "if now the electron is scattered subsequently in a series of sg devices , we have in fact a series of fuzzy instantaneous measurements of energy approximating a continuous one .    as a driving field",
    "we can include an external electromagnetic field in resonance with the difference between the electron levels .",
    "this induces periodic transitions between the levels",
    ". then all the effects discussed in sect .",
    "[ two - level ] can be observed with such a system .",
    "an analysis is given in @xcite .",
    "the results are in agreement with our general results .",
    "one more way of introducing fuzziness can be found in quantum optics .",
    "the multilevel  free \" system is in this case realized as a mode of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the measurement of energy of this system ( usually referred to as the measurement of the photon number ) is realized by the interaction of this mode with another ( probe ) electromagnetic wave through a nonlinear optical kerr medium in which both waves propagate @xcite .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian has the form @xmath224 where @xmath142 , @xmath143 are the annihilation operators of the two modes .",
    "the observable to be measured indirectly is @xmath225 , but the directly measured observable is a quadrature phase component @xmath226    after the probe wave has travelled the distance @xmath227 in the kerr medium , the value of this component is , due to the interaction @xmath228 , @xmath229 where @xmath230 is an initial uncertainty of the amplitude @xmath231 and @xmath232 an initial mean value of the second quadrature component @xmath233 .",
    "this means that the output for the measurement of @xmath43 is read off as the value of the component @xmath231 .",
    "fuzziness of the measurement depends therefore on @xmath230 and can be controlled .",
    "the series of the measurements of this type may be considered as a continuous fuzzy measurement of energy @xmath43 .",
    "fuzziness of a measurement is caused by the low resolution of the detector .",
    "such a measurement is unable to transfer the state of the system to an eigenstate of the measured observable , and the measurement readout must not agree with an eigenvalue .",
    "such a continuous fuzzy measurement as monitoring an observable may be approximated by as a series of unsharp or imperfect  instantaneous \" measurements .",
    "it is qualitatively different from a series of sharp ( von neumann type ) measurements .",
    "we introduced fuzziness with the help of restricted path integrals , on the basis of the resulting non - hermitian hamiltonians .",
    "we discussed the continuous fuzzy measurement ( monitoring ) of energy for a multilevel and in more detail for a two - level system leading to a readout @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to the duration @xmath5 of the measurement there are two other characteristic time scales .",
    "the level resolution time @xmath10 represents the strength of an inherent zeno - type influence (  level freezing \" ) .",
    "if an external resonant driving field is acting upon the system , the strength of its influence is represented by the rabi period @xmath13 . according to the relative orders of magnitudes of these times , different regimes with characteristic properties of the measurement readout and the related evolution of the state vector can be distinguished .",
    "i ) : :    the study of a  free \" multilevel system which is only under the    influence of the measurement ( no driving field present ) shows that    continuous fuzzy measurement of energy is a model for decoherence    leading to the resolution of separate levels .",
    "ii ) : :    the discussion of a resonantly driven two - level system reveals two    different regimes of measurement : in the zeno regime the oscillations    of the state vector are prevented and the measurement readouts are    essentially discrete . in the rabi regime the state oscillations    maintain and the readouts may be arbitrary curves .",
    "iii ) : :    an important new effect is predicted : for time scales corresponding to    the rabi regime but being close to the border with the zeno regime the    frequency of the state oscillations is decreased and their shape    deviates from pure rabi oscillations .",
