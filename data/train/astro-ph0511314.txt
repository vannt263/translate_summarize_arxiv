    "the evolution of dusty circumstellar disks is currently the primary observable constraint on planet formation around young stars .",
    "measurements of the properties of disks around stars in young clusters and associations are especially useful since ages can be more reliably determined for the clusters and associations than for individual stars . by comparing the infrared emission from disks in clusters / associations of different ages ,",
    "disk evolution can be traced as a function of age .",
    "this method has been pioneered by ground - based @xmath4-band observations of young clusters , which can measure excess infrared emission from small dust grains in the inner disk @xcite . by obtaining images at these wavelengths for rich nearby clusters with ages ranging from @xmath5  1 to 30  myr , @xcite measured the fraction of stars that exhibited @xmath6-band excess emission indicative of small dust grains in the inner regions of disks .",
    "they found that this fraction steadily decreased with cluster age with only half of the stars showing @xmath6-band excesses by the age of 3  myr . by 5  myr ,",
    "the @xmath6-band excesses are detected for only 12% of the stars , indicating that the small dust grains in most inner disks have been depleted .",
    "the one significant exception may be the 59  myr @xmath1  chameleontis association ( hereafter eca ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; @xcite reported @xmath6-band excesses in 60% of the stars in this association .",
    "however , @xcite detected @xmath7-band excesses for only 17% stars in the eca , which is consistent with the @xmath6-band excess fractions measured for other clusters by @xcite .    to resolve this inconsistency and obtain a more robust estimate of the fraction of stars with disks in the eca ,",
    "we have obtained photometry at wavelengths longer than the previous ground - based @xmath4 measurements by using the infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the _ spitzer space telescope_. this letter describes these observations , identifies the eca members that have disks based on the irac photometry , and compares the resulting disk frequency to previous measurements of this association and other young associations and clusters .",
    "as a part of the guaranteed time observation program `` disk evolution in the planet formation epoch '' , we obtained images at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  of the 15 known k- and m - type and two known a - type members of the eca @xcite .",
    "irac observed the targets during a 1 hour period ranging from julian date 2453167.068 to 2453167.111 and obtained 0.6 and 12 second exposures at three dithered position toward each of the targets .",
    "we extracted the photometry from the basic calibrated data products ( pipeline version s11.4.0 ) using the idlphot package ( landsman 1993 ) .",
    "the idlphot routines were integrated into a custom idl program that uses the world coordinate system information in the image headers to identify the images containing a given star , find the star within the images , and extract the photometry .",
    "a 5 pixel radius aperture was used for each star , with a sky annulus extending from 5 to 10 pixels .",
    "we used zero points ( for units of dn s@xmath8 ) of 19.6642 , 18.9276 , 16.8468 and 17.3909 @xcite and aperture corrections of 1.061 , 1.064 , 1.067 , and 1.089 for the [ 3.6 ] , [ 4.5 ] , [ 5.8 ] and [ 8.0 ] bands , respectively .",

    "these observations illustrate the importance of longer wavelength observations in detecting disks and the necessity of comparing infrared excess frequencies only within similar wavelength bands .",
    "these data also suggest that the disks in small associations like the eca evolve similarly to disks in large associations with massive stars , such as tr  37 .    of the stars with ir excesses , one ( star 15 ) has an infrared spectral energy distribution that is essentially the same as that of a typical classical t tauri star ( ctts ) with an optically thick disk extending inward close to the stellar surface ( fig .  3 )",
    "the other four show greatly reduced or absent infrared excess emission , particularly at wavelengths @xmath30 m .",
    "this is apparent in both the @xmath9-[4.5]$ ] and @xmath10-[8]$ ] colors as compared to the colors of ctts in taurus ( fig .  1 ) and",
    "the spectral energy distributions compared to the median taurus spectral energy distribution ( fig .",
    "the eca is remarkable for the relatively large fraction of stars exhibiting both disk gas accretion , although at a reduced rate , and very reduced hot dust emission ( fig  4 ) .",

    "the h@xmath3 emission ",
    "line equivalent widths of stars 14 and 16 are @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively @xcite ; the analysis of @xcite suggests that star 16 is accreting while star 14 probably just exhibits chromospheric h@xmath3 emission .",
    "thus , 5 of the 6 stars with irac excesses exhibit gaseous accretion detectable in h@xmath3 .",
    "while longer - wavelength observations will be needed to assess outer disk properties , the presence of gas accretion leads us to suspect that the four eca stars with weak short - wavelength excesses ( 5 , 9 , 14 , and 16 ) are `` transition '' t tauri disk systems such as tw hya @xcite and coku tau 4 @xcite .",
    "these disks are thought to be transitioning from optically thick accretion disks into optically thin planetesimal and debris disks ; in this transition phase the inner disks are optically thin and the outer disk is still optically thick .",
    "transition disks exhibit very low or no dust emission at shorter wavelengths and strong emission at wavelengths @xmath33 m , implying the presence of an inner disk `` hole '' largely cleared of small dust grains and a substantial outer disk of gas and dust .",
    "in such disks , the dust detected by irac is transported into the inner disk by accretion from the outer disk .",
    "in contrast , `` debris disk '' systems , in which small dust grains are produced by the collisions of planetesimals , rarely show excesses at wavelengths @xmath34 m , and they do not show evidence of significant continuous gas accretion onto the central star ( as distinct from infalling bodies ; e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "star 11 , which does show a significant 3.6  @xmath0 m excess , may have an optically thick flat disk due to dust settling and or grain growth in the inner disk @xcite .",
    "current _ spitzer _ infrared spectrometer ( irs ) studies indicate that the number of transition disk systems in taurus ( ages @xmath35  myr ) is relatively small , @xmath36 of the number of classical t - tauri star / disk systems @xcite .",
    "if all ctts in taurus pass through a transition disk stage , this suggests that the transition phase lasts 5% of the total disk lifetime . in sharp contrast , the eca appears to show a transition disk fraction of 4/6 of all systems with infrared excesses .",
    "although the eca contains a higher fraction of low mass mid - m type stars than taurus , of the eight ctts and 10 weak - line t - tauri stars with spectral types of m36 in taurus , none show transition disks .",
    "this suggests that the difference between the eca and taurus is not due to the different distribution of masses in the two assocations .",
    "whether this remarkable difference results from a slowing of disk transitions with increasing age , or some other , possibly environmental , factor is not clear .",
    "we now estimate the size and gas surface density in the inner disk holes . to estimate the sizes of the inner disk holes , we scale a model for tw hya , which has a significant dust excess in the irac [ 8 ] band but little at shorter wavelengths , and has been modelled as having a disk `` wall '' at 4 au with a relatively evacuated region at smaller radii @xcite .",
    "tw hya has a luminosity of about @xmath37 @xcite and the eca disk systems have luminosities of @xmath38 , so our observations suggest evacuated regions of @xmath39 au in size .",
    "the presence of accretion indicates that the inner disk hole does contain gas , and the amount of gas in the inner disk hole can be estimated from the accretion rates inferred from the h@xmath3 velocity widths ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "@xcite estimated mass accretion rates of @xmath40 for stars 5 , 9 , and 11 , and an accretion rate of @xmath41 for 15 .",
    "the lowest rates are well below those observed in taurus and other young regions ( see summary in * ? ? ?",
    "this is not surprising , given the advanced age of eca and the observational indications of decreasing accretion rates with age , although the estimated eca accretion rates appear to fall a bit below a simple model of a viscously evolving disk @xcite .",
    "extrapolation of the steady accretion disk models by @xcite to somewhat lower stellar luminosities and masses suggests that at accretion rates of @xmath42  m@xmath2  yr@xmath8 , the disk gas surface density would be of order 1  g  @xmath43 at 1 au and scale roughly as @xmath44 for a typical viscosity parameter of @xmath45 .",
    "taking a dust opacity ( per gram of gas ) for interstellar ( ism ) dust in the irac 4.5  @xmath0 m band of order @xmath46 ( derived from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a vertical optical depth of unity requires a surface density of @xmath47 . for ism dust ,",
    "the accretion rates imply a 4.5  @xmath0 m optical depth of order 10 at 1 au and about 100 at 0.1 au . to make the disk optically thin within the 0.1 - 1 au range , as required by the observations of the eca transition disks ,",
    "the opacity would have to be reduced by @xmath48 from the ism case . while there are substantial uncertainties in several parameters ,",
    "this result suggests that the dust opacity per unit gas mass in the eca transition disks has declined substantially from the initial value .",
    "thus , it appears likely that the eca has an unusually large proportion of stars in which the inner disks have had substantial dust growth , reducing mid - infrared opacities to low values while still maintaining a significant flow of accreting gas at radii @xmath49  au .",
    "these data are further evidence that in as least some disks , the primodial dust grains in the inner disk are collected into larger dust grains and planetestimals in the first 10  myr of stellar evolution , while gas is still is present in the disk .",
