    "symbiotic stars are interacting binary systems containing a red giant star and a hotter component , which can be a white dwarf , a main sequence star or even a neutron star ( see mikolajewska 2007 for a review ) .",
    "a relatively small fraction of these binaries show evidence for accretion onto the hot component via a disc , while the remainder show evidence of accretion via the wind from the giant star and , in some systems , nuclear burning occurs on the surface of the hot component ( see kenyon & webbink 1984 ) . some systems such as ch cyg ,",
    "have produced jets ( e.g. taylor , seaquist & mattei 1986 , crocker et al .",
    "2001 , galloway & sokolski 2004 ) and large variations ( @xmath05 mag ) in optical brightness over year long timescales ( e.g. mikolajewski , mikolajewska & khudiakova 1990 ) .",
    "more recently , evidence has been presented which suggests that symbiotic stars could be progenitors of a fraction of supernovae 1a explosions ( e.g. dilday et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "given the fact that symbiotic stars contain a red giant star , the binary orbital periods are the longest ( ranging from several hundreds of days to many years ) found in the many different types of interacting binaries . as such , long - duration photometric surveys such as ogle have been used to search for signatures of the binary period ( e.g. angeloni et al .",
    "in contrast , high time resolution photometry or spectroscopic observations are required to search for the presence of phenomena such as accretion whose rate can be variable over the medium to long timescale ( e.g. sokolski , bildstein & ho 2001 and sokolski & kenyon 2003 ) .",
    "the _ kepler _ misson ( borucki et al .",
    "2010 ) provides a unique opportunity to study objects such as symbiotic binaries on short timescales ( 1 min ) and also much longer timescales ( the initial _ kepler _ pointing lasted approximately 4 years ) .",
    "there were two objects classified as symbiotic binaries in the _ kepler _ field  the previously mentioned system ch cyg  and stha 169 .",
    "this paper presents an analysis of _ kepler _ and _ swift _ observations of stha 169 .",
    "( 12,12 ) ( -3,6 . )    ( -3,-0.4 )",
    "stha 169 ( also known as nsv 12466 and s169 ) was classified as a symbiotic binary by downes & keynes ( 1988 ) , and is in the catalogue of symbiotic binaries of belczyski et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , as a result of its optical spectrum which ` resembles that of the quiescent phase of the symbiotic recurrent nova rs oph ' .",
    "stha 169 has the identifier kic 9603833 in the _ kepler _ input catalogue ( brown et al .",
    "2011 ) and has a magnitude of @xmath1=14.37 and colour @xmath2=1.60 in the _ kepler _ int survey ( greiss et al . 2012 ) and @xmath1=14.12 and @xmath2=1.42 in the _ rats - kepler _ survey ( ramsay et al .",
    "stha 169 is recorded in the asas survey of the _ kepler _ field ( pigulski et al .",
    "2009 ) as a source with ` no well - defined periodicity in light variations ' .",
    "the detector on board _ kepler _ is a shutterless photometer using 6 sec integrations and a 0.5 s readout .",
    "there are two modes of observation : _ long cadence _ ( lc ) , where 270 integrations are summed for an effective 29.4 min exposure ( this includes deadtime ) , and _ short cadence _ ( sc ) , where 9 integrations are summed for an effective 58.8 s exposure .",
    "gaps in the _ kepler _ data streams result from , for example , 90@xmath3 spacecraft rolls every 3 months ( called quarters ) , and monthly data downloads using the high gain antenna .    _ kepler _ data are available in the form of fits files which are distributed by the mikulski archive for space telescope ( mast ) . for lc data",
    "each file contains one observing quarter worth of data whereas for sc data one file is created per month . after the raw data are corrected for bias , shutterless readout smear , and sky background , time series are extracted using simple aperture photometry ( sap ) .",
    "we note in table [ kepler - log ] the _ kepler _ quarters in which lc data was obtained and also the _ kepler _ months in which sc mode data was obtained .",
    "the first data to be taken ( q0 ) started in may 2009 and the final data ( q17 ) finished in may 2013 .",
    "lr long cadence & short cadence + ( quarter ) & ( quarter / month ) +   + 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,14,16,17 & 6/2 , 14/2 +      using the data downloaded from mast we used the ` simple aperture photometry ' ( sap ) data and removed data which do not conform to ` sap_quality=0 ' ( for instance , time intervals of enhanced solar activity ) and then normalised this light curve so that the mean count rate was unity ( figure [ light ] ) .",
    "there are clear flux variations on a timescale of tens of days and a semi - amplitude of several percent .    to remove systematic trends in the data ( e.g. kinemuchi et al .",
    "2012 ) we used the task kepcotrend which is part of the pyke software ( still & barclay 2012 ) .",
    "we then applied a small offset so that there are no discrete jumps in flux between the different quarters of data .",
    "this light curve is also shown in figure [ light ] and shows similar features but with fewer large flux variations at the start and end of quarters .",
    "we show the lomb scargle power spectrum ( lomb 1976 , scargle 1982 ) of the corrected light curve in figure [ power ] .",
    "the peaks correspond to periods of 40.0 , 38.5 and 36.3 days .",
    "there are also peaks in the power spectrum at @xmath0200 and 260 days .",
    "however , given the precence of data gaps , the necessary adjustments between each quarter of data and the known presence of a modulation due to the _ kepler _ year ( 372.5 d ) in the data of giant stars ( banyai et al . 2013 ) , some caution is necessary in interpreting long period signals in power spectra such as these .",
    "to further investigate the nature of the light curve , we determined the time of maximum for every peak in the light curve by eye ( the error on the time of maximum was generally 0.3 days which is very much smaller than the range of duration of each cycle ) and then calculated the time difference between successive peaks .",
    "the duration of each cycle is shown in figure [ length ] and shows a considerable range in the duration of each cycle , ranging from 23 to 52 days , with a mean of 34.2 d and @xmath4=8.4 d.      stha 169 was observed in two quarters ( 6 and 14 ) using short cadence mode , which provides photometry with effective exposure times of 58 sec and allows the short term photometric behaviour to be studied in more detail . to remove the effects of systematic trends and also the 2550 day pulsation period we used the pyke task kepflatten .",
    "after normalising the data by dividing the light curve by the mean flux we found the rms was 0.00048 and 0.00049 for data in quarters / months 6.2 and 14.2 respectively .",
    "this result shows very little evidence of short period variability in the _ kepler _ light curve .",
    "( 6,6 ) ( -1.7,-0.5 )    ( 6,6 ) ( -1.7,0 )",
    "stha 169 lies @xmath05 arcmin distant from the @xmath5-ray burst grb060105 and therefore within the field of view of the x - ray ( xrt ) and optical / uv ( uvot ) instruments on - board _",
    "swift_. observations were made between 2006 jan 5th and 11th . however , only in the dataset comprising obsid 00175942000 ( jan 56th ) were observations made in the uv filters .",
    "we therefore restrict ourselves to this dataset .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     ( 6,6 ) ( -2.6,-6.5 )",
    "the _ swift_-2mass spectral energy distribution of stha 169 indicates there are two components , one relatively hot and one relatively cool . using additional information such as the existing optical spectrum of downes & keyes ( 1988 ) our best estimate for the temperature of the two components is 10000k and 3700k .",
    "the _ kepler _ observations therefore sample the cooler ( and physically much larger ) component , while the _ swift _ uv and blue filters sample the hotter component . the _ kepler _ light curve shows quasi periodic behaviour with a mean period of 34 d. given that this period is not stable , it is clearly not the signature of a binary orbital period .",
    "rather it indicates that the cool component is a pulsating red giant star .",
    "this is consistent with the suggestion made by downes & keyes ( 1988 ) that the cool component in stha 169 has a m spectral type and resembles the red giant in the recurrent nova rs oph ( p@xmath6=460 d ; dobrzycka & kenyon 1994 ; m0m2 iii , dobrzycka et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "further confirmation of the evolutionary status of the red giant in stha 169 is provided through its frequency spectrum .",
    "_ kepler _ photometry has been used extensively to characterize red giants as to their membership on the rgb or the agb ( chaplin et al . 2013 ) .",
    "the _ kepler _ light curve of stha 169 is very similar in character to , say , the red giant kic 2986893 ( bnyai et al .",
    "2013 ) which has a mean period of 21.7@xmath7=2.2 d. however , given that stha 169 has a wide range of pulsation period , it is possible that it is a semi regular variable ( cf soszyski , wood & udalski 2013 ) .",
    "bnyai et al .",
    "( 2013 ) showed that m giants separate into three distinct groups according to their period structure .",
    "stha 169 and kic 2986893 belong to group 1  red giants with periods between 10100 days .",
    "group 1 stars with a period similar to that found in stha 169 tend to lie the upper red giant branch ( see kiss & bedding 2003 , 2004 ) and are pulsating due to first and second overtone modes .",
    "( given the main sequence lifetime of a 3.3 @xmath8star is 500 myr , the system is at least this old ) .",
    "the identification of stha 169 as a symbiotic star lies solely with the optical spectrum presented in downes & keyes ( 1988 ) .",
    "the spectral energy distribution as derived from _ swift _ and 2mass photometry and presented in ",
    "[ sed ] is consistent with stha 169 being a binary system .",
    "similarly , our detection of pulsations in the _ kepler _ data clearly demonstrates that the cool star is a red giant .",
    "however , determining the nature of the hot component in symbiotic stars is not a trivial task ( see , for instance , sokoloski & bildsten 2010 who recount the quarter of a century debate on the nature of the hot star in the mira ab system ) .",
    "our spectral energy distribution shows that an isolated white dwarf or a white dwarf with an accretion disk would not lie at the same infered distances for the red giant component . instead our results favour that the hot star is more likely to be a late b or early a main sequence star .",
    "the absence of short period variability in the uv and the non detection in x - rays suggest that accretion was not taking place at the time of these _ swift _ observations .",
    "there are at least two other sources which bear some similarity to stha 169 : xx oph and as 325 which are thought to consist of a be star and a red giant secondary ( howell , johnson & adamson 2009 ) . indeed , as 325 was originally taken to be a symbiotic system .",
    "the fact that the optical spectrum of stha 169 ( downes & keyes 1988 ) shows the balmer lines ( and he ii 4686 ) in emission may indicate that the b / a star is an emission star ( either through a wind or accretion ) .",
    "stars like these are interesting from a binary evolution point of view . determining the binary orbital period is a key step but will be difficult to disentangle the signature of the binary period from the red giant pulsations .",
