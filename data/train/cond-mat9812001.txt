    "the study of quantum impurities remains a large part of condensed matter physics .",
    "the kondo effect is maybe one of the most famous examples for impurity effects , but more recently much effort has been devoted to impurities in low - dimensional magnetic systems in connection with high temperature superconductivity@xcite . for the particular case of impurities in quasi one - dimensional systems ,",
    "much progress has been made with field theory descriptions e.g.  for the kondo model@xcite , quantum wires@xcite , and spin chains@xcite . in those cases ,",
    "the impurity behaves effectively as a boundary condition at low temperatures and the behavior can be described in terms of a renormalization crossover between fixed points as a function of temperature@xcite .",
    "numerically this renormalization picture has been confirmed@xcite , but so far it was only possible to examine a limited number of energy eigenvalues in the spectrum . while some efforts have been made to extract thermodynamic properties from the energy spectrum directly@xcite , such an approach is tedious and remains limited by finite system sizes .",
    "monte carlo simulations appear to be well suited for determining thermodynamic properties , but for the particular case of impurity properties it turns out to be difficult to accurately determine a correction which is of order @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the system size .",
    "we now apply the _ transfer matrix _ dmrg to impurity systems .",
    "this overcomes those problems by explicitly taking the thermodynamic limit @xmath2 , while still being able to probe impurity corrections and local properties at finite temperatures even for frustrated systems ( which are not suitable for monte carlo simulations due to the minus sign problem ) .",
    "there are two separate impurity effects that we wish to address .",
    "the first is the impurity correction @xmath3 to the total free energy of a one dimensional system @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the free energy per site for an infinite system without impurities .",
    "in other words , the impurity contribution is that part of the total free energy that does not scale with the system size @xmath1 @xmath6 therefore , the impurity free energy @xmath3 is directly proportional to the impurity density of the system , and it immediately determines the corresponding impurity specific heat and impurity susceptibility , i.e.  quantities that can be measured by experiments as a function of temperature and impurity density . despite the obvious importance of this impurity contribution we are not aware of any numerical studies that considered this quantity for any non - integrable impurity system .",
    "traditional methods would require an extensive finite size scaling analysis to track down the @xmath0 correction to the total free energy per site , but our approach allows us to calculate @xmath3 directly in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we would like to point out that in other studies the response of an impurity spin to a _",
    "local _ magnetic field is often termed `` impurity susceptibility '' , but we prefer to reserve this expression for the impurity contribution @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a _ global _ magnetic field on the total system",
    ".    the second aspect of impurity effects are _ local _ properties of individual sites near the impurity location , e.g.  correlation functions and the response to a local magnetic field .",
    "local properties have been the central part of a number of works for many impurity models@xcite .",
    "our approach is now able to calculate these impurity effects directly in the thermodynamic limit and we get quick and accurate results to extremely low temperatures .",
    "it turns out that the local impurity effects can be determined much more accurately and to lower temperatures than the impurity contribution @xmath3 , which remains limited by accuracy problems even with this method .",
    "the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite has had a tremendous success in describing low energy static properties of many one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum systems such as spin chains and electron systems .",
    "more recently many useful extensions to the dmrg have been developed .",
    "nishino showed how to successfully apply the density matrix idea to two - dimensional ( 2d ) classical systems by determining the largest eigenvalue of a transfer matrix@xcite .",
    "bursill , xiang and gehring have then shown that the same idea can be used to calculate thermodynamic properties of the quantum spin-1/2 @xmath9-chain@xcite .",
    "the method has later been improved by wang and xiang@xcite as well as shibata@xcite and been applied to the anisotropic spin-1/2 heisenberg chain with great success . in this paper",
    "we apply a generalization of the method to impurity systems , which is presented in section [ method ] . in section iii",
    "we study two different impurity models in the spin-1/2 chain and are able to confirm predictions from field theory calculations .",
    "section iv concludes this work with a discussion of the results and a critical analysis of accuracy and applicability to other systems .",
    "the method of the transfer matrix dmrg can in principle be applied to any one - dimensional system for which a transfer matrix can be defined . as a concrete example we will consider the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chain , since this model is well understood in terms of field theory treatments and has direct experimental relevance .",
    "the heisenberg hamiltonian can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the exchange coupling between sites @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is an external magnetic field in the @xmath15-direction at site @xmath12 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions , @xmath16 , are assumed .",
    "the partition function is defined by @xmath17 where @xmath18 and where we in the last step have partitioned @xmath19 into odd and even site terms , @xmath20      the quantum transfer matrix for this system is defined as usual via the trotter - suzuki decomposition@xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the trotter number .",
    "this expression approximates the partition function up to an error of order @xmath23 and becomes exact in the limit @xmath24 . by inserting a complete set of states between each of the exponentials in eq .",
    "( [ eq : trot ] ) and rearranging the resulting matrix elements , the partition function can be written as a trace over a product of transfer matrices,@xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the @xmath27 dimensional quantum transfer matrix from lattice site @xmath28 to site @xmath29 .",
    "note that @xmath30 is in general not symmetric .",
    "however , if the two - site hamiltonian @xmath31 and @xmath32 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) is invariant under the exchange @xmath33 , and @xmath34 respectively , as is the case unless we have applied a non - uniform magnetic field , @xmath35 is a product of two symmetric transfer matrices , one from site @xmath28 to site @xmath36 and the other from site @xmath36 to @xmath29 . for a uniform system ,",
    "the transfer matrix is independent of lattice site , @xmath37 , and the partition function is then given by @xmath38 in the thermodynamic limit of the uniform system , @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath30 .",
    "the largest eigenvalue @xmath41 can be found exactly only for small trotter numbers @xmath22 .",
    "as @xmath22 increases , the dimension of @xmath30 grows exponentially , and we have to use some approximation technique to find @xmath41 .",
    "analogous to the case where the dmrg can be used to find a certain eigenstate of a hamiltonian as the number of lattice sites increase , we can use the dmrg to find the largest eigenvalue of @xmath30 as the trotter number @xmath22 increase .",
    "the strategy is thus to start with a system block , @xmath42 , and an environment block , @xmath43 , with a small @xmath22 .",
    "the superblock transfer matrix , @xmath35 , with trotter number @xmath22 , is constructed by `` gluing '' together the system block with the environment block .",
    "periodic boundary conditions in the trotter direction must be used .",
    "the reduced density matrix is constructed from the target state , i.e.  the eigenstate of @xmath35 with largest eigenvalue .",
    "since the transfer matrix is non - symmetric , the left and right eigenvectors will not be complex conjugates of each other .",
    "a reduced density matrix for the system as part of the superblock can be constructed by taking a partial trace of @xmath44 over the environment degrees of freedom@xcite , @xmath45 in the thermodynamic limit only the state with the largest eigenvalue will contribute , @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the right and left eigenvectors of the superblock transfer matrix , @xmath49 , corresponding to the largest eigenvalue , @xmath41 .",
    "the matrix elements are given by @xmath50 , where @xmath12 and @xmath51 label the degrees of freedom of the system and the environment respectively and the target states are given by @xmath52 .",
    "the left and right eigenvectors of the density matrix with the largest eigenvalues are then used to define the projection operators onto the truncated basis .",
    "after the first iterations we will keep @xmath53 states for the system and the environment and the superblock will be @xmath54 dimensional .",
    "more details on the transfer matrix dmrg algorithm for quantum systems have been presented in refs .  .",
    "since @xmath55 is non - symmetric it is not obvious that the eigenvalues are real , but because @xmath55 represents a density matrix we expect it to be positive definite .",
    "however , because of numerical inaccuracies complex eigenvalues tend to appear in the course of iterations .",
    "this is usually connected to level crossings in the eigenvalue spectra of the density matrix as @xmath22 is increased .",
    "in addition , we also observe that just before the complex eigenvalues appear , multiplet symmetries in the eigenvalue spectrum of @xmath55 may split up ( often due to `` level repulsion '' from lower lying states which were previously neglected ) . to overcome this problem",
    "it is important to keep all original symmetries ( i.e.  eigenvalue multiplets of @xmath55 ) even as @xmath22 increases . for that purpose",
    "it is often necessary to increase the number of states @xmath53 just before a multiplet tends to split up , which avoids the numerical error that leads to the symmetry breaking . in case of a level crossing of two multiplets",
    "that do not split up , complex eigenvalues may still appear and it is then possible to numerically transform the complex eigenstate pair into a real pair spanning the same space . since the transformed real pair still is orthonormal to every other eigenvector , this transformation does not cause any troubles for later iterations . with this method the eigenvalues",
    "stay complex until the two levels have crossed and moved enough apart , at which point the eigenvalues become real again .",
    "the renormalization procedure is therefore not as straightforward as in ordinary dmrg runs , since it is essential to track _ all _ eigenvalues of @xmath55 and to dynamically adjust the number of states @xmath53 , thereby sometimes repeating previous iteration steps .",
    "the renormalization scheme also allows the calculation of thermal expectation values of local operators .",
    "the magnetization of the spin at site @xmath12 is determined by @xmath56 the operator @xmath57 thus only has to be incorporated in the corresponding transfer matrix at site @xmath12 .",
    "for the _ pure _ system , we then arrive at the formula@xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 is defined similar to @xmath60 but with the additional operator @xmath61 included in addition to the boltzmann weights . to measure the local bond energy , @xmath62",
    ", a similar construction can be used .",
    "let us now assume that the system has a single impurity .",
    "the systems we will study is the periodic spin-1/2 chain with one weakened link or an external spin-1/2 coupled to one spin in the chain @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the _ periodic _ chain and @xmath65 is the spin operator of an external spin-1/2 .",

    "this form can most easily be motivated by writing eq .",
    "( [ eq : impdens ] ) on the form @xmath84 . from a computational point of view , this method is also very convenient ; by storing all target states and projection operators from the dmrg run for the _ pure _ system , all local impurities can be studied by simply using the same projection operators and target states .",

    "there are also other choices of density matrices that can be made . the thermodynamic limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : impdens ] ) can also be interpreted as @xmath85 in which case the impurity transfer matrix would be taken into account in the density matrix .",
    "this would in some sense be analogous to including an operator different from the hamiltonian in the density matrix of the ordinary `` zero - temperature '' dmrg , which is usually not necessary to measure e.g.  correlation functions in the ordinary dmrg .",
    "this approach would destroy the computational advantage of using the pure density matrix , because the pure projection operators and target states could not be used but instead complete dmrg runs would have to be done for each impurity configuration and coupling .",
    "to make a meaningful analysis of the numerical results , we first need to understand the spin-1/2 chain in the framework of the quantum field theory treatment .",
    "this turns out to give a good description of the impurity behavior in terms of a renormalization flow between fixed points , and we will be able to set up concrete expectations for the impurity susceptibility in eq .",

    "the local properties do nt seem to suffer too much from this effect , the reason might be that there is some cancellation of errors in the quotient @xmath157 .    while the accuracy of the second derivative is good enough for the pure susceptibility down to about @xmath158 , we can not trust the impurity susceptibility below temperatures roughly an order of magnitude larger . local impurity properties on the other hand seem to be well represented down to about @xmath149 .",
    "in summary we have shown that the transfer matrix dmrg is a useful method for calculating finite temperature _ impurity _ properties of a spin chain in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have considered two impurity models : one weakened link and one external spin , but the method can be applied to other impurity configurations and electron systems .",
    "we find that the local response of the spin next to a weakened link always crosses over to a constant below some @xmath100 , i.e.  to the behavior of the open chain fixed point .",
    "according to our calculations , the impurity susceptibility shows an exotic cross - over behavior with non - commuting limits . for the external spin impurity",
    ", we have found that the data for the local response shows the expected cross - over to open chain behavior as the temperature is lowered .",
    "the response has the scaling form in eq .",
    "( [ chifscaling ] ) and we can explicitly show the data collapse and determine @xmath100 ( fig .  [ chif ] ) .",
