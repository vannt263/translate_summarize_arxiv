    "an important example has been studied by gubser , klebanov and polyakov @xcite .",
    "they showed that the energy of a spinning string with spin @xmath5 in @xmath6 in the limit that its size is much larger than the @xmath6 radius is e = s + ( s/ )  . in global",
    "coordinates the energy is identified with the dimension of the dual operator .",

    "this operator has an anomalous dimension that grows as @xmath8 , which is in agreement with the strong coupling result derived from supergravity .",
    "quantum corrections to the energy of the spinning string were analyzed in @xcite with no @xmath9 corrections found .",
    "one therefore expects that the leading term in the anomalous dimension to all orders in perturbation theory ( and probably non - perturbatively as well ) is logarithmic , i.e. e = s + f ( ) ( s/ )  . following the work of gkp many other string and membrane configurations were studied @xcite  @xcite . for earlier works on semi - classical string solutions",
    "see @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will study spinning strings in @xmath10 with ns - ns 2-form background .",
    "this is of interest , since string theory on this background can be exactly solved in terms of the @xmath1 wzw model @xcite .",
    "we will see that the `` planetoid '' spinning string solution of @xmath6 is not a solution in @xmath11 because of the ns - ns 2-form . in section 2",
    "we will find the explicit form of the classical spinning string configuration , and calculate the energy ",
    "spin relation .",
    "we will see that the leading behavior is the same as in @xmath6 , but the anomalous correction is constant rather than logarithmic .",
    "this is in contrast with the s - dual background with r - r flux ( for a review see @xcite ) , where the anomalous correction is logarithmic .",
    "indeed it confirms the fact that the near horizon limits of d1-d5 and f1-ns5 systems lead to very different theories . in section 3",
    "we will analyze the conditions under which the classical string configuration is valid as a quantum state . in section 4",
    "we consider more general string configurations that rotate on the @xmath12 part of the metric as well . in the last section",

    "the constraint on the energy - momentum tensor of the system is t_=t_+t _ 2t_=0  . in ( [ constraints ] ) we assumed that there are no other contributions to the energy - momentum tensor from the internal cft on @xmath29 .",

    "we shall only need the explicit form of @xmath64 j^3_r = k ( _ + u+(1 + 2r^2 ) _ + v ) = k ( c_1+k_2-k_1 )  , @xmath65 the other two components , @xmath66 , can be determined in the same way .",
    "note that had we used the ansatz with @xmath67 the currents would have been j^3_r = k ( ( c_1+c_2)+(1 + 2r^2 ( ) ) ( c_1-c_2 ) )  , @xmath68 by taking @xmath69 we can the make left / right current holomorphic / anti - holomorphic , but not both . in wzw theory",
    "the holomorphy of the currents is equivalent to the equations of motion , thus such a configuration does not solve the field equations of the @xmath1 wzw model .",
    "the zero modes of the currents ( [ rlc ] ) are j_0 ^ 3=_0 ^ 2 j_r^3  , _ 0 ^ 3=_0 ^ 2 j_l^3  .",

    "the full quantum spectrum will be associated with the corresponding representation of the affine @xmath76 subject to the physical state constraint .",

    "it can correspond to one of the discrete representations but only if @xmath70 and @xmath89 are integers . if they are not integers they can still belong to a non - unitary continuous representation , but we will not consider them as physical quantum states .",
    "it is clear that to have integer @xmath70 and @xmath89 , @xmath90 must be rational .",
    "let us examine the spectrum for @xmath91 as an example .",

    "the string state corresponds to the wzw state @xmath93 for higher values of @xmath90 there will be other solutions .",
    "it is not clear though whether all integers can be generated by ( [ mmbar ] ) for a given value of @xmath90 .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that using spectral flow one can generate new classical solutions t ( , ) t ( , ) +  , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is an integer .",
    "these new solutions were shown to be important in understanding the nature of long string states in @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath1 currents , and the energy - momentum tensor are modified by the spectral flow to j^3_0  j^3_0 +  , @xmath96 and the same for @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",
    "the spin of the flowed state is the same as the un - flowed state , since it is @xmath99 .",
    "the energy , however , is shifted by @xmath100 .",
    "since the energy tensor is modified by the spectral flow one must impose a new physical state condition t_++^ ( ) = t_++ - j^3_0 - ^2 = 0  , and the same for @xmath101 .",
    "clearly , since @xmath102 for the original solutions , and @xmath103 , there can not be a solution to the physical state condition other than @xmath104 .",
    "in fact , this will also be true even if there are contributions from the cft on @xmath12 , as long as @xmath105 .",
    "we now describe the standard way in which the quantum spectrum of strings in @xmath13 is built around the classical spinning string solution we presented .",
    "we consider the state @xmath106 are the conformal weights of some state of the internal cft on @xmath107 . in our case @xmath108 .",

    "in this section we would like to generalize the discussion of spinning strings in @xmath11 to include rotation in the @xmath12 part of the metric .",
    "the simplest ansatz is to assume that the string is point - like on @xmath12 .",

    "this is automatically satisfied .",
    "however , for generic values of @xmath95 it is not the case .",
    "we shall proceed to solve ( [ drh ] ) under this assumption , and at the end check if ( [ wcon ] ) is obeyed .",

    "= =  .the solution to the other two coordinates can be found in the same way as for the @xmath104 case . in particular , the periodic boundary conditions on the angular coordinate will lead to the same result as in the @xmath104 case with @xmath34 replaced by @xmath121 .",

    "we will shortly see what is the physical meaning of this point .    using this result and ( [ concha1 ] ) we can write down the energy and spin of the string e =  =   , @xmath131 it is again straightforward , though lengthy , to write down @xmath132 .",
    "several important limits of our result can , however , be easily analyzed .",
    "the first one is by setting @xmath104 and retrieving the earlier result ( [ concha1 ] ) .",

    "in this paper we analyzed spinning strings in @xmath10 with ns - ns 2-form background .",

    "using the known relation between the space - times energy in @xmath11 and the eigenvalues of @xmath72 and @xmath97 from the wzw model we get that @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "thus , for a string state with a given @xmath141 ( [ mmbar ] ) we know the exact space - time energy @xmath142 and spin @xmath99 . the classical string solutions that we found also give the information about the general semi - classical relation between the two , @xmath143 .",
