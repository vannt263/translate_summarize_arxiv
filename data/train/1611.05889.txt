    "in flat spacetime one can use the normal ordering operator to regularize this divergence .",
    "unfortunately , normal ordering is not defined in curved spacetime . in 1965",
    "dewitt @xcite used the point - splitting method ( first introduced by schwinger @xcite ) to renormalize @xmath8 , and in 1976 christensen @xcite adapted it for the computation of the rset . in the point - splitting method one can compute the renormalized value of a quantity which is quadratic in the field ( or its derivatives ) at a point @xmath9 , e.g. @xmath10 , by splitting the point @xmath9 into two points @xmath11 , and considering a two - point function ( tpf ) of the form @xmath12 .",

    "the difficulty is caused by the limit @xmath13 .",
    "this limit can be taken rather simply if the modes are known analytically , however , in most cases , and in particular for bhs backgrounds , the modes are known only numerically , which turns the limit into a very difficult task .    to overcome this difficulty , candelas , howard , anderson and others @xcite developed a method to implement point - splitting numerically .",
    "this method relied on a forth order wkb , which is very hard to compute in a lorentzian background , so they have used wick s rotation and computed the rset in the euclidean sector .",
    "more recently , taylor and breen introduced @xcite a more sophisticated version of the traditional method , which does not require a wkb approximation , but is still using the euclidean sector .",
    "unfortunately , the euclidean sector does not exist for most backgrounds , and so the aforementioned methods were developed for static , spherically - symmetric backgrounds .",
    "this leaves out all possible dynamical backgrounds , which are of great interest , as well as backgrounds of spinning bhs , such as kerr , which are stationary but not static .",

    "we then harness it to compute the rset in schwarzschild in all three vacuum states .",

    "another important aspect of the @xmath0-splitting is the different techniques for treating the oscillations . in app .",
    "[ sec : appendix - generalized - integrals - oscillations ] we discussed different techniques that we have explored and were not mentioned in ref .",
    "we believe that one can think of other techniques to implement the generalized integral . as these techniques will become more efficient the number of modes required for regularization will decrease and computation will become easier .",
    "one such approach that we have not tested yet is studying the oscillations using the _ global hadamard form .",
    "_ such global function was recently found for the schwarzschild case by casals and nolan @xcite .",
    "we hope that future work will enable to study the global hadamard function for more generic backgrounds .",
    "the @xmath0-splitting presented here was already used to compute @xmath1 and the rset in the exterior region of kerr @xcite , yet we believe that there are many more implications for it .",
    "possible extensions of the current work in kerr spacetime are to compute the rset inside the ergosphere and inside the horizon .",
    "in addition , the method can be used to study other interesting stationery backgrounds such as compact , rapidly spinning stars .",
    "other implementations of the pmr method , including the details of how to compute the rset using the angular - splitting variant , and the details of the @xmath14-splitting variant will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we think that the different pmr variants can be improved further in the future to create more efficient schemes , without demanding more symmetries .",
    "i would like to thank amos ori , my ph.d .",
    "supervisor , for all his guidance and advice .",
    "i am also grateful to paul anderson for many interesting discussions and for sharing with me his unpublished data .",
    "this appendix briefly summarizes the broad discussion in @xcite regarding the oscillations in the mode sum .",
    "as explained there these oscillations are caused by singularities in the tpf which are not at the coincidence limit .",
    "rather , these singularities correspond to connecting null geodesics ( cngs ) @xcite , and by computing the cngs of the background metric one can compute the wavelengths of the oscillations .    analytically the oscillations are not a problem at all , as our integral is a generalized integral .",
    "one way to define a generalized integral over a function @xmath168 is taking the limit of a laplace transform @xmath169 but this is very hard to perform numerically . to this purpose",
    "we have introduced the self cancellation technique , which enables one to compute the generalized integral for the case of a function with oscillations , given that the wavelengths of the oscillations are known .",
    "for example , if one wants to compute the generalized integral over @xmath168 , which apart from a regularly convergent part contains an oscillatory term of the type @xmath170 , than by first computing the standard integral function @xmath171 one can apply the self - cancellation operator @xmath172\\equiv h\\left(\\omega\\right)+h\\left(\\omega+\\lambda/2\\right)\\ ] ] and the limit @xmath146 of @xmath173 $ ] will converge to the value of the generalized integral .",
    "if the function @xmath168 contains more than a single wavelength , one can simply repeat this process for each wavelength .",
    "moreover , if the function contains oscillations with more divergent amplitudes , e.g. @xmath174 , one can apply the self - cancellation operator repeatedly until the oscillations are suppressed .",
    "this general application of the self cancellation technique we denote by @xmath175\\equiv\\left(t_{\\lambda_{1}}\\right)^{k_{1}}\\left(t_{\\lambda_{2}}\\right)^{k_{2}} ...",
    "\\left(t_{\\lambda_{n}}\\right)^{k_{n}}h\\left(\\omega\\right).\\label{eq : app : self - cancellation}\\ ] ] for the schwarzschild case it was argued @xcite that there is a family of wavelengths @xmath176 with amplitude that decreases exponentially from @xmath177 to @xmath178 ; thus , only the first few wavelength are important . the frequencies that correspond to the first few wavelength @xmath179 are @xmath180    although it is very interesting to learn the origin of the oscillations and obtain the wavelengths by integrating the corresponding cngs it is not really necessary , and one can use other techniques to remove the oscillations .",
    "this techniques are important because for some backgrounds finding and integrating the cngs can be a difficult task .",
    "one such technique that we have explored is simply to use a low pass filter .",
    "this produces very good results , though it is less efficient than a prior knowledge of the wavelengths .",
    "another interesting technique that we have explored is to recursively use a fourier transformation of the integrand @xmath168 to determine the wavelength of the dominant oscillatory term and self - cancel it , this technique also provided good results ."
