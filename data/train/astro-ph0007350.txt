    "the discovery of the twhydrae association as a nearby group of co - moving t tauri stars ( tts ) far from molecular clouds has motivated the search for additional associations of pre - main sequence stars ( pms ) close to earth . in the course of a study of the _ hipparcos _ catalog around iras",
    "60@xmath2 sources recently announced the identification of a co - moving group of stars with general youth indicators .",
    "youth can be deduced from the presence of the @xmath3 li absorption line , h@xmath4 profile , rotation rate , ir excess indicative of circumstellar material , and x - ray emission . while any of these properties certainly are not sufficient to establish the youth of a star , the common presence of several of these characteristics is suggestive for pms nature . however , no accurate age determination is possible by these means .",
    "in addition , for all but one probable tucanae members , _ hipparcos _ parallaxes are available ( see @xcite and our tables  2  and  3 ) , so that the stars can be placed accurately into the h - r diagram .",
    "they all fall near and/or above the zero - age main sequence , hence are really young .    based on proper motion , distance , and the above mentioned youth indicators have divided their sample of potential tucanae members in two groups : probable members with common distance , space motion , and general signs of youth , and improbable members .",
    "this latter group consists of stars which either could be members without signs of youth , or stars which by chance have distances and proper motion similar to the association .",
    "have identified 11 of the probable members with x - ray sources from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey bright source catalog ( rass bsc ; @xcite ) , but only one of the non - members .    in this paper",
    "we present a more detailed study of the x - ray emission of tucanae candidates based on data obtained from the _ rosat _ public data archives .",
    "in particular we use x - ray luminosity distribution functions ( xldfs ) to obtain further clues to the age of this association",
    ". comparative studies of young stellar clusters and star - forming regions based on observations by the _ einstein _ ipc ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) have shown that the x - ray luminosity decays with stellar age .",
    "this is manifest in a decrease of the median of @xmath5 and a corresponding shift of the xldfs with respect to each other . a comparison of the xldf for the tucanae stars with that for well studied star forming regions should therefore allow to put constraints on the age of this association .    in sect .",
    "[ sect : obs ] we describe the observations and analysis of the raw data .",
    "we also provide tables which summarize the x - ray properties of detected and undetected potential tucanae members .",
    "the xldfs of tucanae candidates and comparison samples are discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect : xldfs ] . in sect .",
    "[ sect : variability ] we present the x - ray lightcurves of all detected stars and discuss their variability .",
    "our results are summarized in sect .",
    "[ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "this study is based on the list of potential members of the tucanae association provided by .",
    "we analyze the _ rosat _ observations of all stars from their table  1 , i.e. both ` probable ' members ( table  1a ) and stars termed ` improbable ' members ( table  1b ) .",
    "the _ rosat _ satellite is equipped with two x - ray detectors in the focus of its telescope , the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) and the high resolution imager ( hri ) . see , and for a description of the instrumentation for the _ rosat _ mission .",
    "the raw data of all observations can be retrieved from public archives .",
    "our cross - correlation of table  1 from with the archive showed that none of the stars was in the field of any hri exposure .",
    "however , three stars have been observed in pointed observations of the pspc .",
    "all stars in tucanae have been observed during the _ rosat _ all sky survey ( rass ) .    in this section",
    "we describe our analysis of the pspc data ( in both pointed and survey mode ) using the extended scientific analysis system ( exsas ; @xcite ) .",
    "the results of source detection are presented and the properties of detected and undetected stars are summarized .",
    "three stars from the tucanae membership lists are in the field of view of a pointed pspc observation ( hip92680 , hip100751 , and hip103438 ) .",
    "the _ rosat _ observation request numbers ( ror ) are 201597p , 200099p , and 200404p , respectively . after extracting the raw data from the archive we have performed source detection on these exposures using a combined local and map detection algorithm based on a maximum likelihood technique ( @xcite ) . for the cross - correlation of detected x - ray sources with the membership list introduced above",
    "we allow a maximum distance between x - ray and optical position of @xmath6 ( shown by @xcite to minimize the contamination by background sources ) .",
    "all stars are clearly identified with an x - ray source at an offset less than @xmath7 from the optical position .",
    "the number of counts in the background map at the source location is scaled to the photon extraction area and subtracted from the total number of counts .",
    "count rates are computed using the information in the exposure maps , and transformed into luminosities applying the individual distances of the stars ( derived from the _ hipparcos _ parallax ) and an energy - conversion - factor ( ecf ) determined from the hardness ratio .",
    "hardness ratios computed from the standard energy bands of the pspc provide spectral information in case of low signal - to - noise .",
    "the pspc hardness ratios are defined as follows @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 substitute the number of counts in the respective energy band : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .    as discussed by for late - type stars",
    "the @xmath18 can be computed from @xmath19 and is given by @xmath20 for early - type stars ( hip100751 has spectral type b ) this conversion may not be appropriate . in this case",
    "we have assumed thermal emission at @xmath21 ( see @xcite ) and negligible absorption and computed the @xmath18 following the technical appendix f to the _ rosat _ call for proposals .",
    "alternatively , count rates have been converted to fluxes using standard exsas routines .",
    "the luminosities derived by the two methods were found to be in good agreement , showing that the fleming relation holds for the tucanae stars .",
    "the pointed pspc observations of stars from our membership list are summarized in table  [ tab : allpspc ] .",
    "next to the _ hipparcos _ number , x - ray position , and offset between optical and x - ray position @xmath22 ( column  4 ) we give the maximum likelihood of existence ( column  5 ) , the exposure time ( column  6 ) , and the broad band count rate ( column  7 ) . to derive the x - ray luminosity ( shown in column  8) we have divided the count rate by the number of components in the system (",
    "hip103438 is a binary , the other two stars are singles ; see also tables  [ tab : all_sol ]  and  [ tab : all_upp ] for the multiplicity of the tucanae stars ) .",
    "this implies that all members contribute the same amount of x - ray emission and was shown by to be acceptable in almost all cases according to _ rosat _ hri observations of resolved young binary stars in taurus .",
    "finally , columns  9  and  10 contain the hardness ratios .",

    "in contrast to the pointed observations , where only three tucanae candidates have been observed , x - ray data for all potential tucanae stars are available from the rass .",

    "this is justified because of the small distance and lack of intervening gas in the line of sight .",
    "the low ( @xmath44 ) hardness ratios of the tucanae stars also show that absorption is small if not negligible .",
