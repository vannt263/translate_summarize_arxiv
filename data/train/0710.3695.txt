    "unconventional superconductors are a subject of intensive experimental and theoretical studies during past decade @xcite-@xcite .",
    "coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism results in a number of unusual phenomena , which have both fundamental and application interests .",
    "unconventional superconductors , such as @xmath1 @xcite , @xmath2 @xcite and @xmath3 @xcite , which are characterized by the state with broken time - reversal symmetry ( trsb ) , possess the magnetic structure related to non - zero orbital magnetic moment due to spin - triplet @xmath4-wave state of multi - component sc order parameter .",
    "the properties of such superconductors are not trivial .",
    "in particular , the macroscopic magnetization is not well - defined quality , and the equations of motion can not be expressed in terms of local magnetization @xcite .",
    "starting from the pioneering work @xcite , @xcite on investigation of non - uniform states of superconducting order parameter ( see , also review @xcite ) , the planar defects such as domain walls ( dw ) and surfaces have been attracted recently a lot of interest @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite due to new experiment possibilities , e. g. scanning superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) and hall probe technique , on investigation of magnetic field distribution resulting from spontaneously generated superconducting currents which can serve as a prove of trsb origin of superconducting order parameter in unconventional chiral superconductors .",
    "although , the magnetostatic fields are screened by superconducting current , metastable domain walls ( dws ) , as topologically stable planar defects , may exist even in the meissner state @xcite .",
    "thus , the domain structure of scfm can not be ignored .",
    "the anomalies in the local magnetization loop for sr@xmath5ruo@xmath6 near @xmath7 are considered as a strong indication of the presence of chiral domains @xcite .",
    "the strong coordinate dependence of magnetization of such a @xmath8d magnetic defect creates the intrinsic magnetic field which interacts with superconducting ( sc ) current . for unconventional superconductors",
    "the discontinuity of magnetic induction at the dw can be interpreted as an effective magnetization , and the contribution of dw current to the energy density can be transformed to an effective zeeman term providing the possibility of excitation of orbital magnetization waves by incident electromagnetic field @xcite .    in present publication",
    "we solve the maxwell equations for distribution of magnetic field inside the sample and above it due to the presence of planar defect , such as a dw , show rapid decrease of the magnetic field in the vicinity of sample surface , discuss the long - range origin of this field resulting in existence of the tails at the distance @xmath9 ( london penetration depth ) and compare our results with recent experimental data on measurements of the magnetic field in sr@xmath5ruo@xmath6 by squid @xcite and hall probe technique @xcite .",
    "it is shown that for infinitely thin dw the stray fields above the sample depend only the magnetic field jump at the dw , but not on the details of dw structure .",
    "let us consider the @xmath10 dw of bloch type in a semi - infinite sample of superconducting ferromagnet occupying @xmath11 .",
    "we assume , that the surface of a crystal is parallel to the @xmath12 plane at @xmath13 , and the domain wall , being parallel to the @xmath14 plane , separates two domains with magnetization @xmath15 along the @xmath16 or @xmath17 direction provided that the quality parameter @xmath18 , e.g. the field of magnetic crystallographic anisotropy of the easy - axis ( @xmath19-axis ) type ( @xmath20 ) is high enough in order to stabilize the system against the flip of the domain magnetization into the @xmath21-@xmath22 plane .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the simplest case when the london penetration length @xmath23 exceeds the dw thickness @xmath24 .",
    "this means that at the spatial scales of the order of @xmath24 , the domain wall structure is governed by the exchange and magnetic crystallographic energies and is not affected by the kinetic energy associated with superconducting currents .",
    "thus , we assumed that the next hierarchy of characteristic lengths for scfm is fulfilled : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the size of the domain .",

    "recent experiments on imaging of magnetic field distribution above the surface of the sample of sr@xmath5ruo@xmath6 by scanning squid and hall probe microscopy has revealed no evidence for existence of dws in this unconventional superconductor @xcite .",
    "this negative result can be understood in the framework of the developed theory .",
    "if the dws exist , the maximum value of magnetic induction due to permanent current flowing in the plane of the dw does not exceed the lower critical field , e. g. @xmath10730 g above which the domain structure is unstable due to formation of abrikosov vortices .",
