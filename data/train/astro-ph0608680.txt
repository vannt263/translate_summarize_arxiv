    "while high - resolution spectroscopy is the gold standard of stellar analysis , the daunting photon requirements of this technique generally limit its application to the brightest stars within a given stellar population , i.e. , the giants .",
    "the one major exception is stars from the local neighborhood , where the dwarfs can partially compensate for their dimness by their greater number and hence ( statistically ) their greater proximity . for distant systems , like globular clusters and the galactic bulge",
    ", high - resolution spectra of dwarfs would require exposure times that are at least 100 to 1000 times longer than those of giants , which in most cases is prohibitive .    nevertheless , there are compelling reasons to obtain dwarf spectra in these systems .",
    "element abundances in dwarfs and giants are not necessarily the same even when the progenitors of these stars formed from gas with identical compositions .",
    "mixing on the giant branch can destroy some elements and dredge up others .",
    "measuring the surface - composition differences between dwarfs and giants in the same population is an important test of theories of stellar evolution .",
    "moreover , even when the dwarf and giant element abundances are identical , the _ derived _ values may differ if the atmospheric models used to estimate the abundances are in error . hence",
    ", comparing dwarf and giant spectra is also a powerful way to test atmospheric models .",
    "driven by these considerations , several groups ( e.g. , @xcite ) , have , by prodigious efforts , obtained high - resolution spectra of subgiant and main - sequence turnoff stars in globular clusters .",
    "high - magnification gravitational microlensing events provide a unique opportunity to acquire such spectra .",
    "microlensing events are rare , affecting only about @xmath4 galactic bulge stars at any given time .",
    "the fraction of all events with maximum magnifications @xmath5 is only @xmath6 .",
    "nevertheless , by monitoring more than a hundred million bulge stars , the optical gravitational lens experiment ( ogle - iii )  ogle / ogle3/ews / ews.html ] early warning system ( ews , @xcite ) has been finding about 600 microlensing events in each of the last four years , of which about a dozen per year have @xmath7 .",
    "the microlensing observations for astrophysicsiabond / alert / alert.html ] collaboration has recently inaugurated the second phase of their experiment and expects to soon find a comparable number of high - magnification events .",
    "high - magnification microlensing events remain within half their peak magnification for a time interval @xcite , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the einstein timescale of the event .",
    "hence , for typical einstein timescales ( @xmath10 days ) , high - magnification events will be observable by any given telescope at magnifications @xmath11 . at substantially higher magnifications , the number of events accessible to an observatory falls as @xmath12 , one factor of @xmath13 because the events are intrinsically rarer and a second such factor because the chance that the event will peak near the observatory drops .",
    "nevertheless , there is at least one example of an @xmath14 event , ogle-2004-blg-343 , that peaked over the very large telescopes in chile and was basically recognized as such several hours before peak @xcite .",
    "therefore , at least in principle , it would be possible to obtain of order a dozen spectra of dwarf stars in the galactic bulge per year , each magnified by a factor @xmath15 , with a few at much higher magnifications .",
    "@xcite took the first spectrum of a microlensing event towards the bulge , albeit at low dispersion , but sufficient to determine the spectral type .",
    "@xcite reported the possible detection of li in a bulge dwarf .",
    "@xcite presented a preliminary abundance analysis for six stars with high - resolution spectra including three dwarfs magnified by factors between 2.3 and 30 . here",
    "we report on the abundances of 17 elements in a microlensed bulge dwarf star based on high - resolution spectra , including the first measurements of s and cu .",
    "ogle-2006-blg-265 was alerted as a probable microlensing event toward the galactic bulge ( j2000 ra = 18:07:18.9 , dec = @xmath1627:47:43 ; @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) by ogle ews on 2006 may 25 . on june 5 , ogle issued a further alert that this would be a high - magnification event , with @xmath19 .",
    "intensive photometric observations were then carried out by several collaborations , including the microlensing follow up network ( @xmath20fun)microfun/ ] , primarily with the aim of searching for planets @xcite .",
    "results of that search will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the event actually peaked on june 6 ( hjd 2453893.238 ) at @xmath21 .",
    "two of us ( a.g .- y . ,",
    "j.d.s ) happened to be at the keck telescope when we received the flurry of @xmath20fun emails describing this event .",
    "we interrupted our normal program to obtain two exposures of this event , which totaled 15 minutes .",
    "the observations were carried out approximately 3.6 and 2.7 hours before peak , when the magnification averaged @xmath22 .    using standard microlensing techniques ( e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath20fun determined that the dereddened color and magnitude of the source were @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "ogle independently found a similar value .",
    "the error is due to possible differential reddening between the microlensed source and the red clump , which is assumed to have the same @xmath25 as the local hipparcos clump .",
    "if ( as seems likely ) the source lies at approximately the galactocentric distance , then its absolute magnitude is @xmath26 and its radius is 1.2@xmath27 .",
    "that is , it is a solar - type star .",
    "we observed ogle-2006-blg-265 using the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires , @xcite ) mounted on the keck - i 10 m telescope on 2006 june 6 with a 600s exposure ending at 14:07:11 ut and a 300s second exposure ending at 14:49:53 ut .",
    "these spectra were obtained under good conditions ( clear sky , @xmath28seeing ) .",
    "we used a @xmath29@xmath30slit , yielding a resolution of @xmath31 .",
    "we binned by @xmath32 in the spatial direction to increase the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "the data were reduced using the makee package @xcite and additional iraf scripts we have developed .",
    "the reduction included flat - fielding using internal flats , wavelength calibrations using th - ar arcs , and makee extraction using the trace of a bright calibration star .",
    "the two spectra were combined with @xmath33 in iraf .",
    "we also observed a rapidly rotating hot star for telluric line removal and a radial velocity ( rv ) standard .",
    "the two hires chips covering the green and red parts of the spectrum have higher s / n than the chip with the blue part , and we therefore focused our analysis on the data from 5355 to 8365 .",
    "there are small gaps in the spectrum , but only in the reddest orders .",
    "the s / n per resolution element is @xmath3460 over most of the analyzed spectrum . by cross - correlating",
    "( with @xmath35 ) the spectrum of ogle-2006-blg-265 with the rv standard hd 222563 ( rv@xmath36 , @xcite ) , we found a heliocentric rv of @xmath37 for the microlensed star .",
    "this measurement , together with the source location projected toward the dense fields of the bulge , supports its identification as a bulge star .",
    "the spectrum clearly shows features consistent with its high reddening and large distance from the sun , particularly the interstellar absorption around the na d lines and the presence of the strong diffuse interstellar bands at 5780 and 6283 @xcite . in figure  [ fig : spec ] we show part of the spectrum .",
    "we measured equivalent widths with spectre and then translated those into abundances with the 2002 version of moog @xcite .",
    "we interpolated the kurucz grid with overshooting for [ m / h]@xmath38 ( the limit of the kurucz grid ) for our model atmosphere .",
    "we found the 3-@xmath39 limit for li by performing a @xmath40 test with the data and synthetic spectra from moog .",
    "we set t@xmath41 by requiring that there be no trend in derived abundance in the lines with excitation potential .",
    "we next adopted the log @xmath42 for which the average fe abundance from the and the lines was the same to within 0.01 dex .",
    "we derived the microturbulent velocity @xmath43 by demanding no correlation between the abundance derived from a line and its equivalent width .",
    "our final values are t@xmath41= 5650k@xmath44150k , log @xmath42= @xmath45 , @xmath46 and [ m / h]@xmath47 , where the error in log @xmath42 is essentially all due to uncertainty in t@xmath41 .",
    "we checked our parameters for consistency with other information in two ways .",
    "first , we combined the spectroscopic t@xmath41 with the microlens - estimated radius to find the luminosity and then converted this to mass using the zero - age main sequence padua isochrones for z=0.030 @xcite .",
    "this yielded log @xmath42 = 4.34 , in good agreement with our spectroscopic value .",
    "second , we converted the spectroscopic t@xmath41  to color @xcite , which yielded @xmath48 , i.e. within @xmath49 of the microlens - estimated value .",
    "we adopted the line lists from @xcite for almost all lines .",
    "the exceptions are the , , , and and some lines , for which we used the vald @xcite values .",
    "we used the hyperfine splitting linelists for mn , v , sc , co , cu and ba from @xcite and references therein .",
    "we adopted the solar system isotopic ratios for the cu and ba isotopes .",
    "the enhancement factors to the @xcite damping constants from both bensby et al .",
    "papers were used for elements they studied . otherwise , the unsld values were adopted .",
    "the nlte corrections of the triplet were taken from @xcite .",
    "finally , we used the photospheric abundances of @xcite as the solar values .",
    "we calculated errors for both the @xmath50 and [ x / fe ] values using the general method described in @xcite .",
    "correlations between t@xmath41 and log @xmath42 , [ m / h ] and t@xmath41 , log @xmath42 , and @xmath43 were taken into account , while the correlations of other combinations of parameters are negligible in our analysis .",
    "we found the random error in our analysis due to uncertainties in equivalent widths and atomic data by measuring the standard error of the sample ( @xmath39 ) for elements with multiple lines and dividing by the square root of the number of lines . for elements with one or two lines",
    ", we calculated the error in the equivalent width from the formula in @xcite and adopted a generous error in the oscillator strength of 0.1 dex for the random error .",
    "the abundances and their errors ( @xmath51 and @xmath52}$ ] ) are summarized in table  [ tab : abund ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : abund ] , we plot the abundances compared with recent literature values for several populations in the milky way . we note three overall patterns .",
    "first , ogle-2006-blg-265 is potentially the most metal - rich star known , although first a careful differential analysis with other extremely metal - rich stars from the bulge @xcite and from the local neighborhood ( e.g. , @xcite ) would need to be done .",
    "second , element ratios with o , si , ca , mn , cu and ba follow the trends seen in the local disk / bulge .",
    "third , the light elements na and al are similar in this dwarf to the bulge giants measured by @xcite with the exception of the large al - enhancements seen in a few giants .",
    "the low [ o / fe ] abundance measured in the lensed dwarf is a reflection of its initial values of these elements and is clearly not the result of internal processing , as could be the case with giants .",
    "we also measured a 3-@xmath39 upper limit for li of log@xmath53 dex .",

    "the low [ o / fe ] , [ mg / fe ] , [ si / fe ] , [ ca / fe ] and [ ti / fe ] ( and possibly [ s / fe ] ) ratios reflect the increasing importance of fe contributed by type ia supernovae , while the solar or supersolar [ na / fe ] , [ al / fe ] , [ mn / fe ] and [ cu / fe ] ( and possibly [ co / fe ] ) are the result of the greater ease of forming these odd - z elements in more metal - rich type ii sne .",
