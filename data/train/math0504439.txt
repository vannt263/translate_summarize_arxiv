    "in the last years the study of variational questions in sub - riemannian geometry has experimented an increasing interest . in particular , the recent development of a theory of _ minimal surfaces _ in this context has contributed to achieve a better understanding of the geometry of the _ heisenberg group _ @xmath1 endowed with its _ carnot - carathodory distance_.    it is well - known that minimal surfaces arise as extremal points of the area for variations preserving the boundary of the surface . in this paper , we are interested in sets contained in the heisenberg group which are critical points of the sub - riemannian perimeter under a _ volume constraint_. in order to precise the situation we need to recall some facts about the heisenberg group , that will be treated in more detail in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] .",
    "we denote by @xmath1 the @xmath0-_dimensional heisenberg group _ , which we identify with the lie group @xmath2 where the product is given by @xmath3*[z',t']=[z+z',t+t'+\\text{im}\\big(\\sum_{i=1}^nz_i\\overline{z}'_i\\big)],\\ ] ] with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the lie algebra of @xmath1 is generated by @xmath6 left - invariant vector fields @xmath7 with one non - trivial bracket relation given by @xmath8=-2t$ ] . the @xmath9-dimensional distribution generated by @xmath10 is called the _ horizontal distribution _ in @xmath1 .",
    "usually @xmath1 is endowed with a structure of sub - riemannian manifold by considering the riemannian metric on the horizontal distribution so that the basis @xmath11 is orthonormal .",
    "this metric allows us to measure the length of horizontal curves and define the _ carnot - carathodory distance _ between two points as the infimum of length of horizontal curves joining both points , see @xcite .",
    "since @xmath1 is a group one can consider its haar measure , which turns out to coincide with the lebesgue measure in @xmath12 . from the notions of distance and volume one can also define the minkowski content in the group , and the spherical hausdorff measure , so that different surface measures are also given on @xmath1 . as it is shown in @xcite and @xcite , both notions of ",
    "perimeter \" coincide for a set with @xmath13 boundary .",
    "in this paper we will take a slightly different approach to introduce the notions of volume and perimeter in the heisenberg group .",
    "we consider the left - invariant riemannian metric @xmath14 on @xmath1 so that @xmath15 is an orthonormal basis at every point .",
    "it is known that the carnot - carathdory distance can be approximated in the gromov - hausdorff sense by a sequence of dilated riemannian metrics associated to @xmath16 , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we define the volume @xmath17 of a borel set @xmath18 as the riemannian measure of the set .",
    "the perimeter @xmath19 is defined in the sense of de giorgi by using horizontal vector fields on @xmath1 , see for a precise definition .",
    "this notion of perimeter coincides with the one introduced in @xcite and @xcite , and it is a sub - riemannian analogous of the de giorgi perimeter in the riemannian manifold @xmath20 .    with the notions of volume and perimeter above",
    ", we study in section  [ sec : meancurvature ] _ stationary sets _ of @xmath1 which are critical points of the perimeter functional for volume preserving variations . as in the riemannian case",
    ", one may expect that for such a set some geometric quantity defined on the boundary remains constant . by using the first variation of perimeter in lemma  [ lem : dp / dt ]",
    "we will see that the boundary of a @xmath13 stationary set must have _ constant mean curvature _ ( cmc ) .",
    "the mean curvature of a hypersurface @xmath21 is defined in as the riemannian divergence relative to @xmath21 of the _ horizontal normal vector _",
    "@xmath22 to @xmath21 .",
    "we remark that a notion of mean curvature in @xmath23 for graphs over the @xmath24-plane was previously introduced by s.  pauls @xcite .",
    "a more general definition has been proposed by j .- h .  cheng , j .- f .",
    "hwang , a.  malchiodi and p.  yang @xcite , and by n.  garofalo and s.  pauls @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : computation ] we expose a method to compute the mean curvature of a hypersurface which in particular shows that our definition coincides with the previous ones",
    ".    the recent study of cmc hypersurfaces in @xmath1 has mainly focused on minimal surfaces in @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , many classical questions of the theory of minimal surfaces in @xmath25 , such as the plateau problem , the bernstein problem , or the global behaviour of properly embedded surfaces , have been treated in @xmath23 , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these works also provide a rich variety of examples of minimal surfaces in @xmath23 .",
    "however , in spite of the last advances , very few is known about non - zero cmc surfaces in @xmath1 . in @xcite",
    "some very interesting facts about the cmc equation in @xmath23 , such as the uniqueness of solutions for the dirichlet problem or the structure of the singular set , are studied . as to the examples ,",
    "the only known complete hypersurfaces with non - zero cmc are the compact spherical ones ( example  [ ex : nonzerocmc ] ) described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these hypersurfaces are characterized as the minimizers of perimeter under a volume constraint in the class of sets in @xmath1 bounded by two radial graphs over the hyperplane @xmath26 , see @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study invariant cmc hypersurfaces in @xmath1 .",
    "some examples of invariant minimal surfaces in @xmath23 were previously given by s. pauls @xcite .",
    "he considered the solutions of the minimal surface equation for radial graphs over the @xmath24-plane , and discovered a family of complete surfaces of revolution which are similar to catenoids of @xmath25 , see example  [ ex : minimalsurfaces ] . with the same idea he also introduced some examples of translationally invariant and helicoidal minimal surfaces .    in section",
    "[ sec : main ] of the paper we focus our attention on cmc hypersurfaces of revolution about the @xmath27-axis in @xmath1 . in this case",
    "we can reduce the cmc partial differential equation to a system of ordinary differential equations ( lemma  [ lem : mcequation ] ) .",
    "then , a detailed analysis of the solutions leads us to our main result ( theorem  [ th : main ] ) where we prove a heisenberg analogous of the classification by c.  delaunay @xcite of constant mean curvature hypersurfaces of revolution in @xmath25 , later extended by w .- y .",
    "hsiang @xcite to @xmath28 . as a consequence",
    ", we deduce that the only compact , cmc hypersurfaces of revolution about the @xmath27-axis in @xmath1 are the spherical ones in example  [ ex : nonzerocmc ] .",
    "also that complete minimal hypersurfaces of revolution are hyperplanes orthogonal to the @xmath27-axis and the catenoidal type hypersurfaces in example  [ ex : minimalsurfaces ] .",
    "right cylinders , unduloid type hypersurfaces and non - embedded nodoids provide new examples of complete , periodic hypersurfaces with non - zero cmc in @xmath1 .",
    "in addition to the geometric interest of this work , we believe that our results could contribute to study the _ isoperimetric problem _ in @xmath1 , which consists of finding sets enclosing a given volume with the least possible perimeter .",
    "it was proved by g. p.  leonardi and s.  rigot @xcite that solutions to this problem exist : they are bounded , connected , and satisfy a certain geometric separation property ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.11 ) ) . though the _ isoperimetric sets _ are unknown , we could expect that they are rotationally invariant about the @xmath27-axis , up to a left translation . in case",
    "this was proved , then theorem  [ th : main ] would show that the solutions are congruent with the cmc spheres of revolutions in example  [ ex : nonzerocmc ] .",
    "however , the rotationally symmetry of isoperimetric sets is still an open question .",
    "finally , we must remark that the study of constant mean curvature hypersurfaces in the riemannian manifold @xmath20 is also of great interest .",
    "the complete classification of rotationally invariant constant mean curvature hypersurfaces in @xmath29 was established by p.  tomter  @xcite .",
    "the case of @xmath20 was treated by c.  figueroa , f.  mercuri and r.  pedrosa @xcite .",
    "these papers are based on the so - called _ reduction technique _",
    ", which consists of considering how the constant mean curvature equation descends to the riemannian quotient of @xmath20 by a closed subgroup of isometries , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "we remark that our proof of theorem  [ th : main ] is not a generalization to a sub - riemannian setting of the above mentioned technique .",

    "@xmath1 is the lie group @xmath30 , where we consider the usual differentiable structure in @xmath31 , and the product @xmath3*[z',t']=[z+z',t+t'+\\text{im}\\big(\\sum_{i=1}^nz_i\\,\\overline{z}'_i\\big)].\\ ] ] for @xmath32\\in{\\mathbb{h}^n}$ ] , the _ left translation _ associated to @xmath33 is the diffeomorphism @xmath34 .",
