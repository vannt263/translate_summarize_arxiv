    "the total production rate for taus at a hadron collider is not a useful quantity .",

    "leptonic decays of taus will yield isolated electrons or muons that can be detected but these can also be directly produced so discriminating their origin can be difficult .",
    "hadronic decays of taus result in jets that must be distinguished from jets arising from qcd processes using the particle multiplicity and invariant mass .",
    "the dominant standard model production that results in an observable sample is @xmath1 which produces @xmath2 events per @xmath3 . given this large sample it is reasonable to ask if any useful measurements of tau properties can be made .",
    "measurement of the lifetime is difficult as it requires a determination of the decay length using the vertex tracking system and knowledge of the tau momentum . in the case of",
    "@xmath4 the momentum can be reconstructed using a constrained fit involving the @xmath5 mass ( see section 3 ) .",
    "the process is statistics limited to a precision of approximately 1.8 fs for @xmath6 of data ( @xcite vol",
    "i p. 305 ) .",
    "use of the @xmath7 decay which has a much larger rate is more difficult as there are two neutrinos @xcite .",
    "two methods were attempted involving using the observed tau decay products and the tau mass constraint to determine the momentum of the neutrino in the tau decay and an estimator method @xcite . in this case",
    "the statistical error could be less due to the larger event sample provided that the qcd background can be rejected .",
    "however , the systematic uncertainties from alignment and other sources are difficult to estimate .",
    "rate decays of the tau can provide a probe of new physics .",
    "lepton number is known to be violated in the neutrino sector and the rare decays @xmath8 , @xmath9 or @xmath10 can be expected to occur . in many models @xcite @xcite , @xcite the first of these is expected to be the largest and a simulation will be discussed here @xcite .",
    "the signal is an isolated @xmath11 and photon whose invariant mass reconstructs to the tau .",
    "there are two sources of background @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; the latter dominates . after cuts to reduce the background , the signal acceptance is approximately @xmath14 and the mass resolution is 20 mev resulting in a background of approximately 17 events per @xmath3 .",
    "the resulting limit is not competitive with what is possible at belle and babar unless the full luminosity of the lhc can be exploited .",
    "a study in this environment where the pile - up of minimum bias events degrades resolution and increases background has not been undertaken .",
    "the @xmath15 process is important as a tool for searching for higgs bosons at lhc . as a prelude to this and to illustrate the technique , i will first discuss @xmath4 .",
    "missing neutrinos imply that tau energy can not be measured directly .",
    "however the direction of tau can be obtained from observed decay products as the energy of the produced taus is large compared to the mass . if @xmath5 has signifificant transverse momentum so that tau s are not back to back in phi and the only missing @xmath16 in the event arises from tau decay , then the tau momenta and invariant mass of the @xmath17 system can be reconstructed by assuming that the neutrinos follow the direction of the observed decay products .",
    "these events have no other features so that the selection must be based on the pair of taus .",
    "there is a very large di - jet background from qcd events which must be overcome and the events require a trigger .",
    "events are selected by requiring an isolated electron or muon with @xmath18 gev and @xmath19 and hadronic jet with @xmath20 , @xmath19 , and a number of associated reconstructed tracks @xmath21 , the jet is also required to be narrow , having its energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter confined with a cone of radius @xmath22 in @xmath23 space .",

    "however the lower rate process @xmath29 while it may not enable a discovery to be made , will give information on the higgs couplings .",
    "the two jets arising from the quarks in the production process are at large rapidity and can be used to reject background .",

    "the table shows the expected signal and background @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this result is based on a parametrized simulation that assumes that the tau tagging and jet tagging is not degraded in the presence of pile - up .",

    "a charged higgs boson is expected to decay @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",

    "the former decay is more promising .",
    "production of a heavy @xmath38 via @xmath45 is too small , the production via @xmath46 has @xmath47 pb for a mass of @xmath38 of 400 gev .",
    "the decay @xmath43 will result in either an isolated lepton or jet .",
    "the former is not useful so the latter is exploited .",
    "the final state @xmath48 is identified by requiring three jets one of which is tagged as containing a b - hadron from the vertex system and requiring that these three jets are consistent with @xmath49 ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) .",

    "the mixing between the supersymmetric partners of the left and right handed charged leptons is expected to be small .",
    "however the two @xmath57 mass eigenstates are mixtures of @xmath58 and @xmath59 and we need to measure masses and mixings .",
    "the direct production of @xmath57 via electroweak processes such as @xmath60 is small . in many cases many more",
    "@xmath57 s are produced from decays of strongly produced squarks and gluinos via processes such as @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are weak gauginos and the latter is stable and exits the detector contributing to missing @xmath25 .",
    "it is possible that taus may be the only leptons produced in gaugino decay .",
    "leptonic tau decays are of limited use as the origin of the lepton is unknown ; one must search for hadronic tau decays that give rise to characteristic jets .",
    "susy events are expected to be very complex and one can rely on jet and @xmath64 cuts to get rid of standard model background and obtain clean susy sample . this sample can then be studied in detail .",
    "the background to hadronic tau decays then arises from qcd jets in the susy event and a rejection factor of order 10 ( the number of jets in a such an event ) rather than order 100 which is needed in the analysis described in section [ tausec ] .",
    "a particular model is used in the example illustrated here .",

    "events are selected as follows : @xmath65 jets , one of which has @xmath66 gev and the rest have @xmath67 gev , there are no isolated electrons or muons with @xmath68 gev and @xmath69 gev .",
    "the jets are examined and `` tau '' candidates extracted by selecting jets with low track multiplicity and invariant mass @xcite using an algorithm based on a study using @xmath5 decays to generate taus in the appropriate kinematic regime .",
    "the invariant mass of observed `` tau '' pairs is then shown in figure  [ tautau ] . a clear peak can be seen above the background which is dominated by events where one of the tau jet candidates is a misidentified qcd jet . if all the tau energy had been detected , the distribution would have had a sharp cut - off at @xmath70 which evaluates to 61 gev in this example .",
    "the peak is below this due to the energy carried of by neutrinos in the tau decays .",
    "the situation is rather more complicated than this analysis shows .",
    "the energy distribution of the visible tau decay products depends on the tau polarization and the dependence is largest in the @xmath71 final state and smallest in the states with large hadron multiplicity .",
    "a separation of these states could therefore yield information on the polarization of the taus .",
    "this in turn gives information on the @xmath57 composition .",
