    "quantum contextuality , which was independently discovered by kochen and specker ( ks ) @xcite , and bell @xcite , is a fundamental concept in quantum information theory .",
    "it can be revealed by the ks sets in a logic manner , or by violation of statistical noncontextuality inequalities .",
    "so far , many theoretical and experimental works have been accomplished in order to find the optimal noncontextuality inequalities @xcite or ks sets @xcite , which in turn contribute to the use of speeding up quantum algorithms @xcite .",
    "new theoretical tools @xcite have been invented to study contextuality .",
    "graph theory is a such representative that finds its wide applications and effectiveness in discussing the contextual behavior  @xcite .",
    "two different rank-@xmath0 projective measurements @xmath1 and @xmath2 are said to be exclusive if they commute with one another .",
    "the exclusivity relation of a set of rank-@xmath0 measurements @xmath3 s for a noncontextuality inequality @xmath4 can be effectively represented in an exclusivity graph @xmath5 consisting of vertices and edges , where a pair of vertices @xmath6 are connected if and only if the corresponding events of probability @xmath7 are mutually exclusive . for each exclusivity graph",
    ", the classical bound @xmath8 of the noncontextuality inequality equals to the independence @xmath9 , and the maximal quantum prediction is just the lovsz number @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there is no perfectly  pure \" state in actual experiment .",
    "it is quite necessary to consider mixed states and analyze their influence upon contextuality .",
    "although there are state - independent noncontextuality ( sic ) inequalities , whose quantum violation is independent of which state is to be measured , yet in general the violation of a noncontextuality inequality may depend on the mixedness of the state .",
    "there have been proposed various measures of the mixedness of a state , linear entropy @xcite among them is an efficient one easy to compute : for a @xmath11-dimensional mixed state @xmath12 , the linear entropy is defined as @xmath13)$ ] .",
    "the kcbs inequality @xcite is the simplest noncontextuality inequality , in the sense that it requires the minimal number of projective measurements , while the kk inequality @xcite is a first one that can be violated by almost all states except the maximally mixed state . in this paper",
    ", we focus on these two inequalities . in section",
    "[ mcms ] , the maximal contextuality of mixed states ( mcms ) for a fixed linear entropy is presented for each inequality .",
    "section [ spectral ] then aims to give a spectral analysis on the overall measurement matrix , endeavoring to explore the question of how the existence of a universal set of measurements depends on the spectral distribution . at last , we give some conclusion and discussions .",
    "to start with , the kcbs and the kk inequalities are two of the simple and well - known noncontextuality inequalities for three - dimensional systems , usually written as respectively @xmath14 and @xmath15 where @xmath16 $ ] , @xmath12 is the general mixed state , and @xmath3 s are rank-@xmath0 projective measurements with exclusivity relations shown in figs .",
    "[ figkcbs ] and [ figkk ] .",
    "note that the former is the simplest inequality that requires the minimal number of measurements , while the latter is a first one that is quantum mechanically violated by all but the maximally mixed state .    without loss of generality and for the sake of convenience ,",
    "we consider a quantum state in the diagonal form : @xmath17 with @xmath18 in decreasing order , and @xmath19 .",
    "this makes sense since for a fixed general state and its optimal measurement set , one can always be able to diagonalize the state and change accordingly its overall measurement set by a global rotation .    in what follows",
    "we shall investigate the maximally contextuality @xmath20 of mixed states with respect to a fixed linear entropy @xmath21 , for each inequality mentioned above .",

    "with the above results , we note that there exist a universal set of measuring directions for the kk inequality ; however , this is not true for the kcbs inequality . to proceed , we shall do a spectral analysis on the measuring sets relative to these inequalities .",
    "define @xmath50 which is precisely the expression of inequalities before taking average with a specific state .",
    "the quantum prediction can be denoted as @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "first , we introduce a lemma on hermitian matrices :    [ lemma ] assume that @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 is a unitary matrix . then @xmath56 \\le \\vec{a}.\\vec{b},\\ ] ] where @xmath57 .",
    "directly computation shows that @xmath56 =   \\vec{a } w \\vec{b},\\ ] ] where @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "then @xmath60 is a doubly stochastic matrix by the definition of doubly stochastic matrices .",
    "the birkhoff - von neumann theorem says that the set of @xmath61 doubly stochastic matrices forms a convex polytope whose vertices are the @xmath61 permutation matrices .",
    "if we consider the linear functional @xmath62 on that convex polytope , then its optimal can be achieved at the vertices , i.e. , the permutation matrices . since @xmath63",
    "are already in decreasing order , the maximal of @xmath64 can be achieved when @xmath65 , which implies @xmath66 .",
    "given a state @xmath67 where , @xmath68 . and",
    "the set of measurements @xmath69 is optimal for @xmath12 .",
    "assume @xmath70 is such a unitary matrix that @xmath71 is diagonal and the diagonal is in decreasing order , lemma [ lemma ] tells us that the set of measurements @xmath72 is also optimal while @xmath73 is diagonal .",
    "thus , for our purpose , we can only consider the diagonal @xmath74 : @xmath75 with @xmath76 in decreasing order , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 being the total number of settings ( i.e. , 5 for kcbs and 9 for kk ) .",
    "denote @xmath79 .",
    "the condition @xmath77 restrains @xmath80 within an , e.g. , @xmath81-plane . in general , @xmath82 .",
    "in particular , @xmath83 , which holds only to an edgeless exclusivity graph @xmath5 , that is , there is no exclusive relation between any pair of events of probability .",
    "in fact , the exclusivity relation will further limit the distribution of @xmath80 . as we shall see , the exclusivity relations for the kcbs and kk inequalities are so strong that @xmath80 will be dramatically restrained to a curve , rather than a region in the plane .",
    "the curves of @xmath84 for kcbs and kk inequalities are plotted in fig .",
    "[ ekcbs ] and fig .",
    "[ ekk ] , respectively .",
    "( for comparison , see fig .",
    "[ skcbs ] for the quantum violation of the kcbs inequality by a convex mixture of @xmath29 , @xmath32 and @xmath34 in table [ table1 ] . ) obviously , @xmath85 must be a function of @xmath86",
    ". then @xmath87 by differentiating the expression with respect to @xmath86 , @xmath88 we will obtain the optimal @xmath74 for a given state @xmath12 .        for the kcbs inequality , we have @xmath89 , and    ( i ) : @xmath90{c}\\text{\\resizebox{3ex}{.7ex}{$\\textstyle\\frown$}}\\\\[-0.9ex]\\textstyleac\\endarray}}:\\;\\;\\frac{d c_q}{d m_1 } = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{1-\\frac{4s}{3}}}{2 } + \\frac{1-\\sqrt{1-\\frac{4s}{3}}}{2}\\frac{dm_2}{d m_1}.\\ ] ] then @xmath91 implies that @xmath92 hence , @xmath86 varies with @xmath23 , meaning that there is no universal set of measurements for this curve .",
    "( ii ) : @xmath90{c}\\text{\\resizebox{3ex}{.7ex}{$\\textstyle\\frown$}}\\\\[-0.9ex]\\textstylecd\\endarray}}:\\;\\;\\frac{d c_q}{d m_1 } = \\sqrt{1-s}(1+\\frac{dm_2}{d m_1 } ) < 0.\\ ] ] this shows that the set of measurements in table i is optimal .",
    "( iii ) : @xmath90{c}\\text{\\resizebox{3ex}{.7ex}{$\\textstyle\\frown$}}\\\\[-0.9ex]\\textstylead\\endarray}}:\\;\\;\\frac{d c_q}{d m_1 } = \\sqrt{1-s } > 0.\\ ] ] again , this shows that the set of measurements in table ii is optimal .    for the kk inequality , we find that @xmath93 ( i.e. , @xmath94 ) always holds .",
    "so all the states that violate the inequality possess the same set of measurements shown in table iii",
    ".    moreover , the condition @xmath77 yields @xmath95 for kcbs , this yields @xmath96 , a monotonically increasing relation between @xmath86 and @xmath97 , implying that they take their maxima simultaneously , while for kk this yields @xmath98 , a monotonically decreasing relation , implying that the maximal @xmath97 is obtained when @xmath86 reaches its minimum , and vice versa .",
    "consequently , the spectral distribution of a noncontextualiy inequality can reflect the nature as to whether there exist a universal set of measurements , so that possible experimental setups could be greatly facilitated .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the quantum contextuality of mixed states for the kcbs and the kk noncontextuality inequalities , and explored the question of why there exists a universal set of measurements for the latter , whereas none does for the former inequality .",
    "we have shown that a spectral analysis on the set of measurements may provide insightful clues toward the ultimate answer to this question .",
    "we believe that further works on combining graph theory and spectral theory in studying quantum contextuality may shed new light on these problems .",
