    "the kinetic temperature of quiescent gas in these regions is about 1020  k ; therefore thermal excitation of these transitions in quiescent gas is unlikely .",

    "@xcite as a result of quantum mechanical calculations .",

    "the brightness temperature of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 lines in the suitable models vary from several hundred to several thousand kelvins , and that of the @xmath0 line is higher than 1000 k.    in the case of ngc  1333iras4a , agreement was obtained for a number of models with @xmath53 k and @xmath51  @xmath54 @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath0 lines again proved to be inverted in all suitable models .",
    "the absolute value of the optical thickness of these lines varies within the range 35 , and the brightness temperature varies from several hundred to several thousand kelvins .",
    "we failed to find any suitable model for l1157b1 , since the intensities at 84 and 95  ghz that correspond to the intensity of the narrow feature at 44  ghz are above the upper limits presented in table  [ gauss ] in all computed models .",
    "there are several explanations for this inconsistency within the frames of maser hypothesis .",
    "for example , sobolev  et  al .",
    "@xcite suggested that compact masers arise in turbulent media from the fact that in a turbulent velocity field the coherence lengths along some directions are larger than the mean coherence length .",
    "if the masers are unsaturated , the intensity of maser emission is proportional to @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the optical thickness along the direction . in the first approximation",
    "one can consider that the lvg modeling yields the opacity that is averaged over all directions and the `` mean '' line brightness that corresponds to this opacity .",
    "the larger the mean line opacity the higher the ratio of the maximum brightness to the mean brightness .",
    "consider an example , when the coherence length along some direction is twice its mean value . if the mean opacity equals @xmath57 , which corresponds to the typical opacity of the @xmath0 line , obtained as a result of the modeling of hh  25mms , then the ratio of the peak opacity to the mean opacity equals 2 , and the peak opacity equals @xmath58 .",
    "the ratio of the peak brightness temperature ( i.e. the brightness temperature of the maser spot ) to the mean brightness temperature ( i.e. to the model brightness temperature ) equals @xmath59 . when the mean opacity equals @xmath60 , which corresponds to the typical opacities of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 lines , the ratio of the brightness temperature of the maser spot to the model brightness temperature equals @xmath61 .",
    "thus , in the current example the ratio of the brightness temperatures of maser spots in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 lines to that of the @xmath0 line is less than the model ratio of the intensities of these lines by a factor 7.5 .",
    "this difference is sufficiently large to explain the nondetection of maser features in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 lines in l1157b1 .",
    "the increase of the scattering of coherence lengths may lead to much greater difference between the observed and model ratios of line intensities .",
    "it is interesting that towards the region b2 , located @xmath19 from b1 , kalenskii  et  al .",
    "@xcite observed in 2000 narrow features at 95 , and probably at 84  ghz , whereas in 2004 we found at 7 mm towards this region only a very weak narrow feature ; moreover , this feature may be related to b1 rather than to b2 ( see above ) .",
    "as far as the authors know , no class i maser sources with the emission at 44  ghz stronger than that at 84 and 95  ghz have been found so far . probably , kalenskii  et  al .",
    "observed a variable maser , whose intensity had essentially decreased by december 2004 .",
    "variability of at least two class i maser sources , w3(oh ) and g11.94 - 0.62 , have been noted by kurtz  et  al .",
    "another possible explanation lies in the assumption that the maser at 44  ghz is linearly polarized and , during the observations in 2004 , its polarization plane was orthogonal to that of the receiver .",
    "linear polarization of the @xmath0 masers has not been measured so far ; however , linear polarization has been detected by wiesemeyer  et  al .",
    "@xcite in the @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath62 lines , the degree of the polarization in the @xmath62 line being as large as 33%39% .",
    "probably , the degree of the polarization in the stronger @xmath0 line is the same or even higher and may strongly affect the measured flux density .",
    "interestingly , the radial velocities of maser features virtually coincide with the radial velocities of the peaks of thermal lines @xmath32 , which , in turn , are close to the radial velocities of the quiescent gas .",
    "gueth  et  al .",
    "@xcite performed interferometric observations of l1157 in co and sio lines .",
    "they revealed hollow shells and related these shells to shock waves .",
    "one can reasonably suggest that enhancement of methanol abundance also occur in these shells .",
    "the brightest masers must arise in the directions with the maximum opacity , i.e. along the walls , and therefore must be observed towards the positions indicated in figure  [ shell ] .",
    "since the gas parameters apparently vary with position , the maser region must occupy only a small part of the shell .",
    "since the outflow axis is virtually perpendicular to the direction towards the observer , the radial velocity of maser emission must be close to the radial velocity of the molecular cloud .",
    "this model , as well as the aforementioned turbulent model , suggests a preferential increase of brightness of the most intense lines with respect to the brightness ratios for different lines , obtained for a uniform source of the same temperature and density . in order to test this model",
    "one should perform interferometric observations at 44  ghz , first , of l1157 , and to compare the results with already available interferometric maps in other molecular lines .",
    "thus , further interferometric observations are necessary both in order to test whether the detected narrow lines are actually masers and to choose between different maser models .",
    "the detection of class i methanol masers in relatively nearby regions of low - mass star formation may have a strong impact on the exploration of these masers .",
    "the regions of low - mass star formation are in the whole much closer to the sun and much better studied than massive star - forming regions .",
    "therefore it is much easier to identify the observed masers with other objects ( e.g. with the wings of bipolar outflows ) than when observing regions of high - mass star formation .",
    "as a result of a short survey of bipolar outflows driven by low - mass young stars in the methanol lines @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 we detected narrow features towards ngc  1333iras4a , hh  25mms , and l1157  b1 .",
    "flux densities of these features are no higher than 11  jy , which is much lower than the flux densities of strong maser lines in regions of high - mass star formation .",
    "nevertheless , most likely the narrow features are masers . in order to confirm this suggestion further interferometric observations",
    "are required ; in addition , these observations may help to make a choice between different maser models .",
