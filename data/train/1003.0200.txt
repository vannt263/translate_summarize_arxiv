    "we also found that slow relaxation processes take place also in non - random systems .",
    "we have pointed out that frustration causes a stabilization of the spin state by a kind of screening effect , and a very slow dynamics appears .",
    "we recently proposed a mechanism of slow relaxation in a system without an energy barrier for the domain wall  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have also studied the relation between the temperature dependence of static quantities and their dynamics after a sudden change of the temperature in some frustrated systems where the temperature dependence of the spin correlation function is non - monotonic . in that study",
