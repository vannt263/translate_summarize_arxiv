    "a @xmath8-source @xmath1-terminal ( @xmath8s@xmath2 t ) sum - network is modelled as a directed , acyclic , finite graph @xmath9 with a set of @xmath8 vertices @xmath10 called sources and a set of @xmath1 vertices @xmath11 called terminals ( sinks ) , such that each source @xmath12 generates a message @xmath13 and each terminal wants to obtain the sum @xmath14 using linear network coding @xcite , where @xmath15 is a finite field .",
    "the problem of communicating the sum over networks is in fact a subclass of the problem of _ distributed function computation _ over networks , which has been explored in different contexts @xcite-@xcite , most are from information theoretic perspective and focus on small or simple networks .",
    "the study of network coding for sum - networks began with a. ramamoorthy @xcite and was investigated from several aspects recently @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite , it was shown that for a @xmath8s@xmath16 t or @xmath17s@xmath2 t sum - network with unit capacity edges and independent , unit - entropy sources , it is solvable if and only if every source - terminal pair is connected .",
    "the main focus of the study on the sum - network is to determine the solvability .",
    "one direction is to find out necessary and sufficient solvability conditions for @xmath8s@xmath2 t sum - network of larger integers @xmath8 and @xmath1 . in this direction ,",
    "successes to date are sporadic and the best known result is from shenvi and dey @xcite , where the authors characterize the solvability of @xmath0s@xmath7 t sum - networks using a collection of six `` connection conditions '' .",
    "another direction is to derive bounds on the capacity , or similarly  sufficient or necessary conditions on the solvability of sum - network . in @xcite ,",
    "some upper and lower bounds on the capacity of sum - network are presented .",
    "these bounds are observed to be loose for the case of @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in @xcite",
    ", the authors proved that the linear solvability of a sum - network is equivalent to the linear solvability of some multiple - unicast network and vice versa .",
    "they also proved that for any set of polynomials having integer coefficients , there exists a sum - network that is scalar linear solvable over a finite field @xmath15 if and only if the polynomials have a common root in @xmath15 .",
    "however , both the multiple - unicast network coding problem and the problem of solving the common root of polynomials with integer coefficients are np - hard , which indicate that the @xmath8s@xmath2 t sum - network problem for @xmath18 and @xmath19 is very challenging .",
    "like the other settings of multiple - source multiple - sink network coding problem , loosely speaking , the difficulties of the sum - network problem lie in two aspects : one is the topological structure of the underlying network , which can be of arbitrary complex ; the other is the distributed function computation nature of the coding requirements .",
    "so what is of most importance than new results , is to develop new methodologies to handle the difficulties mentioned above , both for analyzing of network structure and for coding design .",
    "the first methodology that we developed is focusing on the network structure .",
    "the region decomposition method , which has been found efficient for analyzing network structure and very successful in the 2-multicast networks @xcite and 2-unicast networks with non - single rates @xcite , is further developed in this paper . in @xcite",
    ", we proved that each directed , acyclic network @xmath9 has a unique `` _ basic region graph _ '' , denote by @xmath20 , and the network coding problem on @xmath9 can be converted to a coding problem on @xmath20 .",
    "generally , @xmath20 could have a much more `` simpler '' topological structure than @xmath9 . in the present paper ,",
    "we further develop this method and decompose a network @xmath9 by two steps .",
    "in the first step , we perform basic region decomposition and construct the basic region graph , just as in @xcite . in the second step ,",
    "we further decompose the basic region graph into mutually disjoint parts and consider the possibility of designing valid code in each part separately .",
    "most important , there is a special subgraph , denoted by @xmath21 , such that to determine solvability of @xmath9 , we only need to consider code design problem on @xmath21 . specifically , @xmath9 is solvable if and only if there exists a code on @xmath21 which satisfies some certain conditions .",
    "this significantly simplifies the original problem of determining solvability .",
    "another methodology is the concept of `` weak decentralized code '' that generalize the `` decentralized code '' in @xcite . rather than that in @xcite where the coding vectors of _",
    "any two _ subtrees are linear independent , by weak decentralized code , each `` equivalent family of regions ''",
    "is assigned the same coding vector , and for any two regions , their coding vectors are linearly independent if and only if they belong to different equivalent families .    combining the developed region decomposition and weak decentralized code methods , we give a sufficient and necessary condition for the solvability of a class of @xmath0s@xmath2 t sum - network , termed _ terminal - separable region graph _",
    ", for arbitrary @xmath22",
    ". the condition can be verified in polynomial time . moreover , as two simple corollaries of our result , we prove that : ( 1 ) a @xmath0s@xmath16 t sum - network is always solvable if each source - terminal pair is connected ; ( 2 ) a @xmath0s@xmath7 t sum - network is unsolvable if and only if the basic region graph has some certain fixed structure .",
    "following the technical line of this paper , we can also completely characterize the solvability of @xmath0s@xmath23 t sum - network .",
    "limited by space of this paper , we leave the results of @xmath0s@xmath23 t sum - network to a future paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    ", we introduce the network coding model of sum - network .",
    "the method for region decomposition and for decomposing the basic region graph is presented in sections and .",
    "the method of weak decentralized code for @xmath0s@xmath2 t sum - network is presented in .",
    "we characterize solvability for terminal - separable @xmath0s@xmath2 t sum - network in section .",
    "finally , the paper is concluded in section .",

    "for the sake of convenience , if @xmath43 is not a source link ( resp . terminal link ) , we call @xmath32 a _ non - source link _ ( resp .",
    "_ non - terminal link _ ) .",
    "we assume that each non - source non - terminal link @xmath32 of @xmath9 is on a path from some source to some terminal .",
    "otherwise , @xmath32 has no impact on the network coding of @xmath9 and can be removed from @xmath9 .",

    "for any subset @xmath48 , let @xmath49 denote the subspace of @xmath47 spanned by @xmath50 .",
    "for @xmath51 , let @xmath52 denote the vector of @xmath47 with the @xmath53th component being one and all other components being zero .",
    "meanwhile , we denote @xmath54 i.e. , the vector with all components being one .    for any linear network coding scheme , the message transmitted along any link @xmath32 is a linear combination @xmath55 of the source messages , where @xmath56 .",
    "we use the vector of coefficients , @xmath57 , to represent the message @xmath58 and call @xmath59 the global encoding vector of @xmath32 . to ensure the computability of network coding , the outgoing message , as a @xmath8-dimensional vector , must be in the span of all incoming messages .",
    "moreover , to ensure that all terminals receive the sum @xmath14 , if @xmath32 is a terminal link of the sum - network , then @xmath60 .",
    "thus , we can define a linear network code of a @xmath8s@xmath2 t sum - network as follows :    [ lnc ] a _ linear network code _ ( lc ) of @xmath9 over a field @xmath15 is a collection of vectors @xmath61 such that    * @xmath62 if @xmath32 is the @xmath63 source link @xmath64 ; * @xmath65 if @xmath32 is a non - source link .",
