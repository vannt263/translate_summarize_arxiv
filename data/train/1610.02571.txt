    "the term spherical couette flow refers to the fluid motion between two rotating spherical shells . if the liquid is electrically conducting and exposed to an external magnetic field , the set - up is sometimes called magnetized spherical couette ( msc ) flow . for the special case of resting outer cylinder ,",
    "the system is completely defined by three dimensionless parameters @xcite : the reynolds number @xmath3 as a measure of the rotation ( with angular velocity @xmath4 of the inner sphere with radius @xmath5 ) , the hartmann number @xmath6 with @xmath7 denoting the strength of the applied axial magnetic field , and the geometric aspect ratio @xmath8 with the outer sphere radius @xmath9 . here",
    ", @xmath10 denotes the kinematic viscosity , @xmath11 the density , and @xmath12 the conductivity of the fluid .    a long , albeit contentiously , discussed result of msc flow was the observation of an angular momentum transporting , magnetically induced instability in a turbulent liquid sodium flow at @xmath13 , which was described in @xcite as the long sought - after magnetorotational instability ( mri ) .",
    "in contrast to the mri as usually described @xcite , this instability was non - axisymmetric and demonstrated an equatorial symmetry whose parity depended on the strength of the applied magnetic field .",
    "subsequent numerical investigations @xcite turned up a collection of induction - free instabilities related to the hydrodynamic jet instability , the kelvin - helmholtz - like shercliff layer instability , and a return flow instability that replicated the parity properties , as well as the torque on the outer sphere ( the proxy measurement of angular momentum transport ) , as documented in @xcite .    in order to study these types of instability in more detail , the new apparatus hedgehog ( _ h_ydromagnetic _ e_xperiment with _ d_ifferentially _",
    "g_yrating sph_e_res _ ho_lding _ g_ainsn ) has been installed at helmholtz - zentrum dresden - rossendorf ( hzdr ) .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , hedgehog operates in a quasi - laminar regime with two possible aspect ratios @xmath14 .",
    "numerical reference data is available for both these cases @xcite .",
    "its typical operating parameters , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , place hedgehog in a wider class of experiments dealing with inductionless instabilities , such as the helical @xcite and azimuthal mris @xcite , and the tayler instability @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : hedgehog_anlage ] gives an overview of the experimental setup .",
    "the main parts , comprising the spherical vessel , the coil pair , the system controls and the diagnostics are mounted on a rack shown in the global view ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hedgehog_anlage]a ) .    the central module ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hedgehog_anlage]b ) contains one of two inner spheres ( @xmath17 cm or 4.5 cm ) rotating in the center of an outer sphere ( @xmath18 cm ) .",
    "both spheres are made of polymethyl methacetate ( pmma ) acrylic with 30 cylindrical holders for ultrasonic doppler velocimetry ( udv ) , and 168 copper electrodes for electric potential measurement .",
    "two 90w motors drive the inner and outer spheres independently of each other .",
    "the outer sphere rests on a turntable connected to one motor ; a 3 mm drive shaft , which widens up to a 6 mm outside the shell , connects the inner sphere to the upper turntable .",
    "this paper is restricted to experiments with the outer sphere at rest and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 hz . ) .",
    "the space between the two spheres is filled with gainsn .",
    "because of the high density of this medium ( 6360kg / m^3^ ) , each optional inner sphere contains a lead weight to counter the buoyancy force .",
    "the axial magnetic field is provided by a pair of copper electromagnets with central radii of 30 cm , and a vertical gap of 31 cm between them .",
    "this near helmholtz configuration produces a static , vertical magnetic field with less than one percent inhomogeneity in the relevant measurement volume , providing @xmath21 ( @xmath22mt ) .     from the equator , note , however , that their viewing angle has been chosen as @xmath23 , in order to identify clearly the jet instability at low values of @xmath1.,scaledwidth=99.0% ]    ultrasound transducers ( usts ) mounted on the outer sphere allow a wide variety of velocity field measurements from 30 different positions ( 5 different latitudinal positions repeated at 6 evenly spaced longitudes , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sensor ] ) .",
    "the maximal wall thickness between the ust and the fluid is @xmath24 mm .",
    "we use usts with 4mhz emitting frequency and the ultrasonic doppler velocimeter ( udv ) dop3010 ( signal processing sa , switzerland ) . in future a large number of installed copper pins will additionally be used as electro - static potential probes .",
    "the outer sphere and the provided measurement technique are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hedgehog_anlage]b .",
    "the experiment s dynamics are described by the incompressible navier - stokes equation , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a reduced pressure absorbing all potential forces , and no - slip conditions at the inner and outer spheres define the drive of the flow by the rotating inner sphere . the navier stokes equation couples to the magnetic induction equation in its inductionless limit , @xmath27 in this limit the generation of a magnetic field @xmath28 from the interaction of a velocity field @xmath29 with a background field @xmath30 is exactly balanced by its diffusion .",
    "initial simulations of the hedgehog were carried out with the code described in @xcite . these provided predictions of the diagnostic outputs and demonstrated a possible saturation mechanism for the instabilities @xcite .",
    "further simulations were carried out with an adapted version of the magic code @xcite , which has a long and very successful record of simulating dynamos in spherical geometry @xcite .",

    "before any further evaluation , intensive post processing of the raw udv data was necessary .",
