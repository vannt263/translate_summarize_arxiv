    "the study of curves is an important chapter of geometry . besides its intrinsic importance",
    ", curves also play a major role in the analysis of surfaces , and manifolds in general .",
    "in particular , the consideration of curves that belong to a given surface , such as planar or spherical curves @xcite , may be of great value . in this respect an interesting problem then arises _  how can we characterize those ( spatial ) curves that belong to a certain surface @xmath4?\"_. despite the simplicity to formulate the problem , there is no known general solution to it except for a few cases : namely , when @xmath4 is a plane @xcite , a sphere @xcite , or a cylinder @xcite . the solution for planar curves",
    "is quite trivial once we introduce the frenet frame : the torsion must vanish . on the other hand ,",
    "the characterization for spherical curves generally involves an ode relating the curvature function and the torsion @xcite , while the characterization for cylindrical curves involves a system of algebro - differential equations @xcite . in the 70 s , through the idea of equipping a curve with a relatively parallel moving frame , bishop was able to characterize spherical curves through a linear equation relating the coefficients that dictate the motion of a relatively parallel moving frame @xcite .",
    "the coefficients of such a bishop frame admit a simple geometric interpretation and , besides its impact on the study of spherical curves , a bishop frame also has the advantage of being globally defined even if a curve has points of zero curvature @xcite .",
    "naturally , it also finds applications in problems which made use of frames along curves , such as in rotation - minimizing frames in rigid body dynamics @xcite , computer graphics and visualization @xcite , robotics @xcite , quantum waveguides @xcite , integrable systems @xcite , and also in mathematical biology in the study of dna @xcite and protein folding @xcite , just to name a few .",
    "we should not restrict ourselves to the context of an euclidean ambient space , @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , we can consider the more general setting of a lorentz - minkowski space , @xmath6 , where one has to deal with three types of spheres : pseudo - spheres @xmath7 ; pseudo - hyperbolic spaces @xmath8 ; and light - cones @xmath9 , where @xmath10 .",
    "it is possible to find characterizations of some classes of spherical curves scattered among a few papers : characterizations of pseudo - spherical @xcite and pseudo - hyperbolic curves @xcite via frenet frame ; and also curves on light - cones @xcite by exploiting conformal invariants and the concept of cone curvature @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to find constructions of bishop frames on curves in @xmath1 for spacelike curves @xcite with a non - lightlike normal , and timelike curves @xcite , along with several characterizations of spherical curves through a linear equation by using the respective bishop frame @xcite .",
    "all the above mentioned studies in @xmath1 have in common that much attention is paid on the possible combinations of casual characters of the tangent and normal vectors , which makes necessary the consideration of several instances of the problem of building bishop frames and characterizing spherical curves . moreover",
    ", none of them take into account the possibility of a lightlike tangent or a lightlike normal .",
    "naturally , this reflects in the incompleteness of the available characterizations of spherical curves in @xmath1 .",
    "here we apply these ideas in order to characterize those spatial curves that belong to surfaces implicitly defined by a smooth function , @xmath2 , by reinterpreting the problem in the new geometric setting of an inner product induced by the hessian , @xmath11 . since a hessian may fail to be positive definite , one is naturally led to the study of the differential geometry of curves in lorentz - minkowski spaces . in this work , we then present a systematic approach to moving frames on curves in @xmath1 .",
    "the turning point is that one should exploit the casual character of the tangent vector and the induced casual character on the normal plane . in other words , one must look at the symmetry that characterizes the problem . in this way",
    ", we are able to furnish a systematic approach to the construction of bishop frames in @xmath1 .",
    "this formalism allows us to give a complete characterization of spherical curves in @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we present a necessary and sufficient criterion for a curve to lie on a level surface of a smooth function when the hessian is non - degenerate .",
    "more precisely , we present a functional relationship involving the coefficients of a bishop frame with respect to the hessian metric along a curve on @xmath2 , which reduces to a linear relation when @xmath12 is constant . in this last case , we are able to characterize spatial curves that belong to a given non - degenerate euclidean quadric @xmath13 , @xmath14 constant , by using @xmath15 .",
    "we also furnish an interpretation for the casual character that a curve may assume when we pass from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , which also allows us to understand why certain types of curves do not exist on a given quadric or on a given lorentzian sphere , if we reinterpret the problem from @xmath1 in @xmath0 .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time that this characterization problem is considered in a general context .",
    "therefore , our work paves the way for a theory aimed at identifying the curves that do belong to a given surface .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the construction of relatively parallel moving frames in euclidean space according to bishop .",
    "section 3 is devoted to moving frames in lorentz - minkowski spaces : subsection 3.1 to frenet frames in @xmath1 ; subsections 3.2 and 3.3 to bishop frames along space- and timelike curves and their geometric interpretations , respectively ; and , subsection 3.4 , to null frames along lightlike curves . in section 4",
    "we characterize spherical curves in lorentz - minkowski spaces , i.e. , curves on pseudo - spheres , pseudo - hyperbolic spaces , and light - cones . in section 5 we characterize curves on a non - degenerate euclidean quadric .",
    "in section 6 we present a characterization of curves that lie on a regular level surface . and finally , in section 7 we present ours conclusions along with some open problems and directions of future research .",
    "let us denote by @xmath0 the euclidean space @xmath16 equipped with the standard metric @xmath17 . given a curve @xmath18 parametrized by arc - length , the usual way to introduce a moving frame along it is by means of the frenet frame @xmath19 .",
    "however , we can also consider any other adapted orthonormal moving frame @xmath20 along @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the equations of motion of such a moving frame are then given by a skew - symmetric @xmath24 matrix .",
    "for the frenet frame one of the entries of this matrix is zero and the other two are the curvature function @xmath25 and the torsion @xmath26 : @xmath27    by introducing the notion of a relatively parallel vector field , bishop considered a moving frame @xmath28 , where @xmath29 are normal vectors to the unit tangent @xmath30 , whose equations of motion are @xcite @xmath31    a vector field @xmath32 along @xmath21 is relatively parallel if the derivative of its normal component , @xmath33 , is a multiple of the unit tangent vector , i.e. , @xmath34 , and the tangent component is a constant multiple of @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath35 and @xmath36 relate with the curvature function and torsion according to @xcite @xmath37    an advantage of such a relatively parallel moving frame , or bishop frame for short , is that it can be globally defined even if the curve is degenerate , i.e. , if the curvature @xmath25 vanishes at some points @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it also allows a simple characterization of spherical curves :    a @xmath38 regular curve lies on a sphere if and only if its normal development , i.e. , the curve @xmath39 , lies on a line not passing through the origin .",
    "moreover , the distance of this line from the origin , @xmath40 , and the radius of the sphere , @xmath41 , are reciprocals : @xmath42 .",
    "[ theo : bishopcharacspherericalcurves ]    straight lines passing through the origin characterize planar curves which are not spherical @xcite .",
    "bishop frames are not uniquely defined .",
    "indeed , any rotation of @xmath43 and @xmath44 still gives two relatively parallel fields , i.e. , there is an ambiguity associated with the group @xmath45 acting on the normal plane .",
    "however , the coefficients still determines a curve up to rigid motions @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath25-constant curves are represented by circles centered at the origin with radius @xmath25 @xcite , which can also be seen as the orbits of the symmetry group @xmath45 .    in the following",
    "we shall extend this formalism in order to present a way of building bishop frames along curves in @xmath1 and then apply this formalism to furnish an unified approach to the characterization of spherical curves in @xmath1 ( i.e. , curves on pseudo - spheres , pseudo - hyperbolic spaces , and light - cones ) , curves on quadrics in @xmath0 , and also characterize curves that lie on level surfaces of a smooth function by reinterpreting the problem in a new geometric setting .",
    "as said before , @xmath0 denotes @xmath16 equipped with the standard metric . in addition , let us denote by @xmath46 the vector space @xmath16 equipped with a pseudo - metric @xmath47 of index @xmath48 .",
    "in fact , the concepts below , and the construction of bishop - like frames as well , are still valid in the context of a 3-dimensional semi - riemannian manifold @xcite , but to help intuition , the reader may keep in mind the particular setting of @xmath16 equipped with the standard minkowski metric , i.e. @xmath49 .",
    "naturally , in this general context , the derivative of a vector field along a curve should be understood as the covariant derivative .    before discussing the moving frame method on curves in @xmath1 ,",
    "let us introduce some terminology and geometric properties associated with @xmath1 ( for more details , we refer to @xcite ) .",
    "one property that makes the geometry in lorentz - minkowski spaces @xmath1 more difficult and richer than the geometry in @xmath0 is that curves and vector subspaces may assume different casual characters .",
    "a vector @xmath50 assume one of the following _ casual characters _",
    ":    a.   @xmath51 is _ spacelike _ , if @xmath52 or @xmath53 ; b.   @xmath51 is _ timelike _ , if @xmath54 ; c.   @xmath51 is _ lightlike _ , if @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the inner product @xmath47 induces a pseudo - norm defined by @xmath57 .",
    "given a vector subspace @xmath58 , we define the orthogonal complement @xmath59 in the usual way : @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , we can consider the restriction of @xmath47 to @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath61 be a vector subspace , then    a.   @xmath61 is _ spacelike _ if @xmath62 is positive definite ; b.   @xmath61 is _ timelike _ if @xmath62 has index 1 ; c.   @xmath61 is _ lightlike _ if @xmath62 is degenerate .",
    "we have the following useful properties related to the casual characters :    let @xmath63 be a vector subspace .",
    "then ,    a.   @xmath64 and @xmath65 ; b.   @xmath61 is lightlike if and only if @xmath59 is lightlike ; c.   @xmath61 is spacelike ( timelike ) if and only if @xmath59 is timelike ( spacelike ) .",
    "d.   @xmath61 is lightlike if and only if @xmath61 contains a lightlike vector but not a timelike one .",
    "moreover , @xmath61 admits a orthogonal basis formed by a lightlike and a spacelike vectors .    given two vectors @xmath66 , the lorentzian vector product , denoted by @xmath67 , is the only vector that satisfies @xmath68 where the columns of @xmath69 are formed by the entries of @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "from these definitions , we say that a curve @xmath72 is spacelike , timelike , or lightlike , if its velocity vector @xmath73 is spacelike , timelike , or lightlike , respectively .",
    "analogously , we say that a surface is spacelike , timelike , or lightlike , if its tangent planes are spacelike , timelike , or lightlike , respectively .",
    "if a curve is lightlike we can not define an arc - length parameter ( in @xmath0 this is always possible ) . in this case , one must introduce the notion of a _ pseudo arc - length parameter _ ,",
    "i.e. , a parameter @xmath74 such that @xmath75 . more precisely , if @xmath76 is a lightlike curve and @xmath77 ( otherwise @xmath78 and @xmath73 will be linearly dependent and the curve is a straight line ) , we define the _ pseudo arc - length parameter _ as @xmath79 on the other hand , if @xmath76 is not a lightlike curve , then the _ arc - length parameter _ is defined as usual @xmath80 in the following we will assume every curve to be parametrized by the arc - length or pseudo arc - length parameter when possible .",
    "the study of the local properties of a curve @xmath81 in a frenet frame fashion becomes quite cumbersome due to the various possibility for the casual characters of the tangent and its derivative .",
    "in essence , there is a construction for each combination of the casual characters of @xmath30 and @xmath82 .",
    "let @xmath83 be the ( unit ) tangent parametrized by arc- or pseudo arc - length .",

    "if @xmath30 and @xmath87 are not lightlike , then @xmath88 where @xmath89 , and @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the curvature function and torsion of @xmath76 , respectively is slightly different from that of lpez @xcite . indeed , despite the fact that the definition is formally identical to the euclidean version , our @xmath25 is a signaled curvature and its sign encloses the casual character of the curve in a natural manner . ] .",

    "this skew - symmetric matrix is precisely the coefficient matrix that we would obtain for a frenet frame in @xmath0 .",

    "a curvature can not be defined for such curves @xcite .    in the following , when discussing bishop frames in @xmath1 along non - lightlike curves and null frames along lightlike curves , we will see that the matrix of coefficients can be obtained from a skew - symmetric matrix ( precisely the matrix that we would obtain for a bishop frame in @xmath0 ) through a right - multiplication by the matrix associated with a convenient basis .",
    "the more complete and systematic approach to the problem of the existence of bishop - like frames along curves in @xmath1 was presented by zdemir and ergin @xcite , where they build bishop - like frames on timelike and spacelike curves with a non - lightlike normal . however , as in the frenet frame case , they also paid much attention to the casual character of @xmath82 . here , we show that one must exploit the structure of the normal plane inherited from the casual character of @xmath30 in order to build an unified treatment of the problem .",
