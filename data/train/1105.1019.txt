    "classification of the phases of matter is a major problem at the heart of recent activities in quantum many - body physics research , especially after the discovery of topologically ordered phases .",
    "the quantum double model of kitaev  @xcite and the string - net condensation model of levin and wen  @xcite show that the phase diagram of 2d systems can be very complicated .",
    "these two models of commuting hamiltonians are exactly solvable and exhibit a rich structure in their ground states as well as elementary excitations . in 1d , however , we are not aware of any essential example of a _ commuting _ hamiltonian besides the ising model .",
    "moreover , simulation of the ground states based on tensor networks has been proven to be efficient in 1d gapped systems  @xcite .",
    "so we expect to have an easier theory in 1d . before reviewing known results in this regard",
    "let us first describe what we exactly mean by a phase .",
    "hamiltonians of interest are _ translational invariant _ spin hamiltonians defined on a lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we assume that hamiltonians are _ scale invariant _ , meaning that the ground state degeneracy is independent of the system size , and also have a constant gap above the ground state energy which again is independent of the size of the system .",
    "we say that two such hamiltonians ( their associated ground spaces ) belong to the same phase if there exists a continuous path of hamiltonians satisfying the above conditions starting with one of them and ending with the other .",
    "chen et al .",
    "@xcite and schuch et al .",
    "@xcite have recently shown that assuming the ground space of such a 1d hamiltonian is _ exactly _ describable by matrix product states ( mpss )  @xcite , the only parameter that distinguishes phases is the ground state degeneracy .",
    "although it seems that we can remove the assumption in this result by using the proven area law in 1d  @xcite , there are some technical obstacles .",
    "first , we are able to approximate the ground state of any gapped 1d hamiltonian by an mps , whose bond dimension _ scales _ ( polynomially ) with the system size . in  @xcite and  @xcite",
    "however , the bond dimension is assumed to be fixed independent of the system size .",
    "second , we need to show that the true ground state and the approximate mps are in the same phase which again should be proved with a gap that is independent of the system size .    yoshida  @xcite has considered the problem of classification of phases in the special case of stabilizer hamiltonians .",
    "he has shown that any translational invariant and scale invariant stabilizer hamiltonian in 1d is equivalent to some independent copies of the ising model , and in 2d we essentially have the 2d ising model and the toric code .",
    "he has proved a similar result in 3d assuming some extra conditions  @xcite .",
    "although stabilizer hamiltonians seem very restrictive , they have been extensively studied in the theory of quantum error correcting codes and quantum memories because of their simple structure of syndrome measurements .",
    "the advantage of these results comparing to  @xcite is that yoshida s classification gives a characterization of _ logical operators _ , and consequently low anergy excitations as well .",
    "we emphasis on the latter because for instance in the models of quantum double and string - net condensation the structures of elementary excitations are much richer than that of ground states .    in this paper we generalize yoshida s results in 1d .",
    "we consider frustration free commuting hamiltonians that are both translational and scale invariant . due to the commutativity assumption",
    "these hamiltonians are automatically gapped .",
    "we associate a graph with a hamiltonian of this form and show that cycles of this graph encodes ground space of the hamiltonian .",
    "we also comment that the low energy excited states are described by paths of the graph .",
    "our main result is that the phases of the ground states of these systems are determined only by their degeneracy .",
    "although our assumption of commutativity comparing to that of  @xcite seems very restrictive , this at least can be easily verified .",
    "even the scale invariance of a hamiltonians is hard to check in general , but for commuting hamiltonians we provide a simple criterion to verify that .",
    "moreover , in the last section we show that our results can be applied to a wider class of hamiltonians than commuting ones .",
    "let us first fix some notations .",
    "hilbert spaces are denoted by @xmath1 , and @xmath2 is the hilbert space corresponding to _ register _",
    "@xmath4 is the identity operator of @xmath2 , and @xmath5 is the space of linear operators acting on @xmath2 . we may consider @xmath5 as a hilbert space equipped with the hilbert - schmidt inner product .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the phases of ground spaces of hamiltonians define on a 1d chain with periodic boundary condisions .",
    "we say that ground spaces of two hamiltonians belong to the same phase if there exists a continuous path of _ gapped _",
    "hamiltonians starting with one of them and ending with the other . here",
    "we often consider translational and scale invariant hamiltonians in which case we further assume that all hamiltonians along the path are translational and scale invariant and their gap is independent of the system size .",
    "we do not impose this constraint for commuting hamiltonians , i.e. , two commuting hamiltonians are said to belong to the same phase even if the path connecting them consists of non - commuting ones .",
    "this is because we are considering phases of ground spaces , and a phase is usually defined by translational and scale invariant hamiltonians .",
    "so these two properties are essential in the definition of the problem but being commuting is an extra constraint which we impose for simplification .    by this definition when two hamiltonians @xmath6 and @xmath7 have the same ground spaces , they belong to the same phase .",
    "in fact , the linear interpolation @xmath8 , @xmath9 , is the path between them and one can easily show that these hamiltonians for all @xmath10 are gapped .",
    "local unitaries also do not change the phase of a ground space .",
    "that is hamiltonians @xmath11 and @xmath12 , for unitary @xmath13 belong to the same phase , and the path @xmath14 , @xmath9 , where @xmath15 , connects the two hamiltonians .",
    "note that translational and scale invariance are preserved in these two interpolations .",
    "we may also embed the hilbert space of local spins into larger hilbert spaces ( and modify the local terms of the hamiltonian ) .",
    "this does not change the ground space and we again obtain the same phase .    here",
    "we focus only on _ frustration free _ hamiltonians .",
    "thus by a shift of energy we may assume that the local terms of the hamiltonian are positive semidefinite and the ground space energy is zero .",
    "let @xmath16 be such a hamiltonian where @xmath17 acts only on sites @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath20 be the orthogonal projection onto the positive eigenspaces of @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath20 is a projection and @xmath21 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that @xmath6 is gapped if and only if @xmath22 is gapped .",
    "moreover , @xmath6 and @xmath7 have exactly the same ground spaces and by the above observation belong to the same phase .",
    "this means that without loss of generality we may assume that the local terms of the hamiltonians are projections .",
    "note that if @xmath6 is commuting then @xmath7 is commuting as well .",
    "this is because @xmath20 belongs to the algebra generated by @xmath17 and the identity operator .",
    "the following lemma due to bravyi and vyalyi  @xcite is a key step towards understanding the ground space of commuting hamiltonians . for the sake of completeness",
    "we also include a sketch of the proof .",
    "[ lem : comm ] suppose that @xmath23 and @xmath24 are two hermitian operators acting on finite dimensional hilbert spaces @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "assume that @xmath27 and @xmath28 commute .",
    "then there exists an index set @xmath29 and decomposition @xmath30 such that @xmath23 acts nontrivially only on @xmath31 and not @xmath32 ( for all @xmath33 ) , and similarly @xmath24 acts nontrivially only on @xmath32 .",
    "more precisely , if we let @xmath34 be the orthogonal projection onto the subspace @xmath35 , then @xmath36 for some hermitian operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 acting on @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively",

    "we conclude that the ground space of @xmath53 , for all @xmath49 , is completely characterized by the graph @xmath65 and the subspaces @xmath87 corresponding to each edge @xmath88 .",
    "similarly to the ground states that correspond to cycles of @xmath65 ,",
    "it is easy to see that excited states with energy 1 correspond to paths of @xmath65 , and eigenstates with eigenvalue 2 correspond to unions of two paths .    note that the translational invariance assumption in this result is not crucial .",

    "the index set @xmath29 associated with @xmath53 has four elements and components of decomposition   are @xmath107 note that in this case since these subspaces are all one dimensional , we do not need to specify subsystems @xmath108 , @xmath109 individually .",

    "however , @xmath113 is a path which can not be completed to a cycle and then @xmath114 is an excited state with energy 1 .    , and hamiltonian @xmath106 . this hamiltonian is commuting and translational invariant but not scale invariant . , width=144 ]",
    "we now apply the assumption that the system is scale invariant , meaning that for sufficiently large @xmath49 the ground state degeneracy is a constant independent of @xmath49 .",
    "so we let @xmath53 be commuting , and translational and scale invariant .",
    "our goal in this section is to show that for every @xmath49 @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the set of loops of @xmath65 .",
    "let @xmath117 be a cycle of @xmath65 . by going around @xmath118 many times",

    "then @xmath128 are different cycles in @xmath129 , and similarly @xmath130 are distinct . therefore , @xmath131 now applying the scale invariance assumption we have @xmath132 .",
    "so by comparing equations  - we obtain @xmath133 for every edge @xmath88 in one of the cycles @xmath123 or @xmath134 .",
    "( note that when @xmath88 is an edge of @xmath65 , @xmath135 is non - zero . )",
    "we further conclude that @xmath136 and indeed @xmath137 thus for some @xmath138 , @xmath139 . by the fact that @xmath49 and @xmath140 are relatively prime",
    ", we find that the arbitrarily chosen cycle @xmath118 consists of the repetition of a single loop .",
    "we conclude that the scale invariance assumption implies that all cycles of @xmath65 are essentially loops .",
    "then   is an immediate consequence of  .",
    "the structure of the ground space of @xmath53 in even simpler with the scale invariance assumption .",
    "let @xmath141 be a loop of @xmath65 , and let @xmath142 be a vector that spans @xmath143 .",
    "then @xmath144 is a ground state , and the ground space of @xmath76 is spanned by these vectors for all loops @xmath141 of @xmath65 .",
    "the vectors @xmath144 are still mpss and in fact translational invariant mpss .",
    "the example of figure  [ fig : graph ] is not scale invariant because the graph contains cycles that do not come from loops .",
    "for the special case of the 1d ising model , the graph @xmath65 consists of two vertices with two loops and no other edges . from these two loops and the above construction we obtain the all spin - up and all spin - down states as the ground states of the ising model .",
    "elementary excitations are also easier to characterize with the scale invariance assumption .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , elementary excitations correspond to paths of @xmath65 , and excitations with energy 2 come from unions of two paths .",
    "a sufficiently long path in a finite graph must contain a cycle .",
    "since loops are the only cycles of such @xmath65 , any elementary excitation of @xmath53 , for sufficiently large @xmath49 , contains several copies of states @xmath145 , for loops @xmath146 , in their subsystems .",
    "in fact an energy 1 eigenstate corresponds to a path of the form either @xmath147 or @xmath148 .",
    "for example , ising model does not have any energy 1 eigenstate because its corresponding graph is a union of two loops and there is no edge of the form @xmath149 for @xmath150 .",
    "we are now ready to study phases of 1d spin chains with commuting hamiltonians . objects of interest are ground spaces of 1d commuting hamiltonians that are both translational and scale invariant . by the discussion of section  [ sec : key ] without loss of generality",
    "we can also assume that the hamiltonian is a summation of local projections .",
    "thus we may use results of the previous two sections which are summarized as @xmath151 where @xmath152 is one dimensional and is spanned by @xmath153 .    here since we are interested only in the ground spaces we can replace the other @xmath154 s that do not appear in the above expression with the identity operator .",
    "more precisely , for every @xmath150 , or @xmath155 where @xmath146 is not a loop , define @xmath156 , and for loops @xmath157 let @xmath158 .",
    "furthermore , define @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "then @xmath161 is still commuting and translational invariant .",
    "moreover , its corresponding graph consists of the same loops as @xmath65 , but no other edges .",
    "in fact , using , @xmath161 has the same ground space as @xmath53 and they are in the same phase .",
    "so we may replace @xmath53 with @xmath161 , i.e. , we assume that @xmath162 and @xmath163 .    for every loop @xmath164 fix arbitrary states @xmath165 and @xmath166 . let @xmath167 be a unitary operator that acts on @xmath168 in such a way that @xmath169 .",
    "recall that the hilbert space of two qudits @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be decomposed as @xmath170 thus we can define the two - qudit unitary operator @xmath13 that acts as @xmath167 on the subsystem / subspace @xmath171 when @xmath141 is a loop , and acts as the identity operator elsewhere .",
    "define @xmath172 , and @xmath173 .",
    "since @xmath13 is block - diagonal with respect to the decomposition   and acts trivially on @xmath174 and @xmath175 , the new hamiltonian @xmath176 is commuting . the corresponding graph of @xmath176 is the same as that of @xmath53 and consists of a union of loops .",
    "the only difference is that the state corresponding to the loop @xmath146 , is equal to @xmath177 .",
    "two hamiltonians @xmath53 and @xmath178 belong to the same phase because they differ only by local unitaries ( see section  [ sec : key ] ) . so again without loss of generality",
    "we assume @xmath179 and @xmath180 . in this step",
    "we turned @xmath145 , which belongs to @xmath168 , into a product state .    by   the ground space of @xmath53",

    ". then they belong to the same phase .",
    "moreover , since @xmath186 and @xmath187 were arbitrarily chosen , the only parameter that determines @xmath185 is the size of @xmath188 , i.e. , the ground space degeneracy .",
    "for example for two loops we obtain the ising model whose local projections are given by @xmath189 we conclude that the phases of ground spaces of translational and scale invariant commuting hamiltonians in 1d are characterized by their degeneracy .",
    "in this paper we described the structure of the ground states of translational and scale invariant , 1d commuting hamiltonians .",
    "we associated a graph with a commuting hamiltonian which encodes the ground space in its cycles and the low energy states in its paths .",
    "our results generalize yoshida s work in 1d who considers stabilizer hamiltonians  @xcite . comparing to  @xcite instead of assuming that the ground states are described by mpss",
    ", we imposed the assumption that the hamiltonian is commuting .",
    "in section  [ sec : scale ] we argued that ground states of the hamiltonians under consideration can be exactly written as translational invariant mpss .",
    "thus we could have skipped the previous section and directly used the result of  @xcite to conclude that the ground state degeneracy is the only parameter that distinguishes phases .",
    "our arguments , however , are based on much simpler techniques and we preferred not to refer to  @xcite .",
    "our results can be applied on a larger class of hamiltonians than the commuting ones .",
    "let @xmath190 be an arbitrary translational invariant ( frustration free ) hamiltonian .",
    "as before without loss of generality we may assume that @xmath191 is positive semidefinite and the ground state energy of @xmath53 is zero .",
    "suppose that there exists a _ positive definite _",
    "matrix @xmath192 such that @xmath193 then the hamiltonian @xmath194 with local term @xmath195 is commuting .",
    "these local terms are still positive semidefinite , and one can easily observe that @xmath94 is a zero energy state of @xmath176 if and only if @xmath196 is the ground state of @xmath53 .",
    "thus the new hamiltonian is frustration free as well .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath192 is assumed to be positive definite and then invertible , the correspondence between ground states is one - to - one .",
    "therefore , @xmath176 is scale invariant if and only if @xmath53 is scale invariant , and in this case results of our paper are applied .",
    "for instance , we showed that ground states of commuting hamiltonians have mps representations .",
    "moreover , if @xmath94 is an mps then @xmath196 is an mps as well ( see figure  [ fig : mps ] ) . as a summary",
    ", the existence of a positive definite matrix @xmath192 satisfying implies that the ground states of @xmath197 have mps representations , and results of @xcite are applied .    with the above technique",
    "sometimes we can turn a hamiltonian whose ground space has mps representation into a commuting one .",
    "in particular the converse of this observation holds for hamiltonians with a _ unique injective _ mps ground state in the following sense .",
    "consider a translational invariant hamiltonian with a unique translational invariant mps ground state @xmath94 .",
    "we assume that the bond dimension of this mps representation is @xmath95 and the corresponding map is @xmath198",
    ". then we have @xmath199 where @xmath96 is the maximally entangled state with local dimension @xmath95 .",
    "we may also replace @xmath200 with @xmath201 where @xmath13 is a unitary map . in this case",
    "@xmath94 is replaced with @xmath202 which by the discussion of section  [ sec : key ] belongs to the same phase as @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath200 is injective because we assume that @xmath94 is an injective mps .",
    "then the map @xmath203 is well - defined on the support of @xmath200 .",
    "in fact , we may identify the domain and support of @xmath200 , and by applying an appropriate @xmath13 ( replacing @xmath200 with @xmath201 ) assume that @xmath200 is hermitian and positive definite .",
    "we now introduce a commuting hamiltonian as follows .",
    "consider @xmath204 spins of dimension @xmath95 sitting on @xmath49 sites of a chain .",
    "so there are two spins on each site which are denoted by @xmath205 and @xmath206 , and the hilbert space corresponding to sites @xmath18 and @xmath19 is @xmath207 define the local projection @xmath208 and let @xmath209 .",
    "@xmath210 is commuting , translational invariant , and frustration free with the unique ground state @xmath211 .",
    "moreover if we define @xmath212 then @xmath11 has a unique ground state which is @xmath94 . as a result ,",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath6 with ground state @xmath94 can be turned into a commuting one using equation   with @xmath213 .",
    "we conclude that mps ground states and commuting hamiltonians are in close relation via .",
    "the advantage of working with commuting hamiltonians , however , is that verifying commutativity in general is much easier than checking whether the ground space is describable by mpss .",
    "the author is thankful to norbert schuch for explaining the difficulties in removing the assumption of  @xcite that the ground space is describable by mpss , and to ramis movassagh and unknown referees whose comments significantly improved the presentation of the paper ."
