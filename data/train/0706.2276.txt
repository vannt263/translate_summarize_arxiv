    "the saturation model of golec - biernat and wsthoff ( gbw )  @xcite has been very successful in describing both the inclusive , @xmath0 , and diffractive , @xmath1 , structure functions of proton at low values of the bjorken variable @xmath2 .",
    "it incorporates the idea of parton saturation in a simple way by introducing the @xmath2-dependent saturation scale in the form @xmath3 with the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 determined from the fit to @xmath0 .",
    "the model was then improved by bartles , golec - biernat and kowalski ( bgk )  @xcite by including the dglap evolution of the gluon density , whose effects are important for the small-@xmath6 part of the dipole cross section .",
    "this allowed to describe the new , more precise , hera data .",
    "however , only the three light quarks contributions to the inclusive structure function @xmath0 were considered by these authors .    in order to consistently describe dis",
    "one should take into account also the contributions of the heavy quarks since , as found by h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite , they may reach 30% for charm and 3% for beauty . in this short note",
    "@xcite we present the results of the studies  @xcite of the dglap improved saturation model where also the charm and beauty quarks are present .",
    "the parameters of the model with the five flavors are fixed by the fit to the @xmath0 experimental data .",
    "then , the contributions of the heavy quarks to the proton structure function , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , as well as the longitudinal structure function @xmath9 and the diffractive structure function @xmath1 are _ predicted_.    this study is related to that presented in  @xcite where the proton profile function is taken in a gaussian form . in our case , however , the gluons are assumed to be evenly distributed over a certain area with a sharp boundary . furthermore , in our approach we do not need to introduce an arbitrary mass for the light quarks as it was done in  @xcite .",
    "the dipole picture of the photon - proton interaction at low @xmath2 has been demonstrated to be a  useful tool for calculating proton structure functions , both inclusive and diffractive . in this framework",
    "@xmath10 interaction is regarded as a two - stages process .",
    "firstly , the photon with the virtuality @xmath11 dissociates into a quark - antiquark par of a given flavor .",
    "this pair , referred to as a color dipole , is characterized by the fraction of the photon momentum carried by the quark ( or antiquark ) @xmath12 and the @xmath13 transverse distance vector @xmath14 .",
    "the splitting is described by the photon wave function @xmath15 , quantity fully calculable in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) . in the second stage , described by the dipole cross section @xmath16",
    ", the color dipole interacts with the proton and , since the non - perturbative contributions are expected to be important , modeling of @xmath16 can not be avoided .",
    "the expression for the inclusive proton structure function @xmath0 may be , quite generally , written as    @xmath17    where the sums run over the quark flavors @xmath18 and the polarizations of the virtual photon @xmath19 .    in the bgk model the following form of the dipole cross section",
    "is used @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "it interpolates between the gbw cross section  @xcite ( at large @xmath6 ) and the perturbative result  @xcite ( at small @xmath6 ) .",
    "thus , both the feature of color transparency and gluon saturation are incorporated in this definition .",
    "the gluon distribution evolves with @xmath22 according to the leading order dglap equation , simplified further by neglecting quarks , with the mrst inspired initial condition    @xmath23    altogether , the model has five parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which are determined by the fit to the @xmath0 data .",
    "the fit with the charm and beauty contributions was performed using the recent data from h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite .",
    "the h1 data points were multiplied by 1.05 to account for slightly different normalizations between the two experiments . since the dipole picture is expected to be valid only at sufficiently small @xmath2 we restricted ourselves to . due to the fact that the gluon density is evolved according to dglap equations",
    "the model is supposed to work for any value of photon virtuality .",
    "thus , in the fit , we used the entire range of @xmath11 covered by the data .",
    "this gave us 288 experimental points .",
    "the light quarks were taken massless and the typical values for the masses of the heavy quarks were used , namely @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the number of active flavors was set to 4  ( for the fit with charm ) or 5  ( for the fit with charm and beauty ) , the value of @xmath31  mev , and the argument in the dipole cross section was modified @xmath32 similarly to  @xcite .",
    ".the results of our fits with heavy quarks to the @xmath0 data and the massless fit from  @xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results of the fit with heavy quarks are summarized in table [ fit_results ] , where also the light quarks fit parameters from  @xcite are recalled for reference .",
    "we see that the quality of the fit in terms of @xmath33/ndf is good . adding heavy quarks results in a rather dramatic change of the parameters of the model .",
    "in particular , the sign of the power @xmath28 alters which means that the initial gluon distribution grows with decreasing @xmath2 oppose to the the case of the light quarks fit where it was valencelike .",
    "the predictions for the heavy quark contributions to the structure function , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fcfb ] .",
    "we observe very good agreement with the data points from h1  @xcite .",
    "this persists even for @xmath34 that is beyond the range used in the fit to determine the model parameters .",
    "the diffractive structure function @xmath1 was also calculated and good agreement with the h1 and zeus data was found .",
    "likewise , the longitudinal structure function @xmath9 obtained from our analysis agrees with the h1 estimations . for more details on @xmath9 and @xmath1 the reader",
    "is referred to  @xcite .    ) and beauty ( @xmath35 ) structure functions from the bgk model with heavy quarks compared with the h1 data  @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ] ) and beauty ( @xmath35 ) structure functions from the bgk model with heavy quarks compared with the h1 data  @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    let us finally discuss the effect of heavy quarks on the position of the critical line .",
    "this line in @xmath36 plane which marks the transition to the saturation region is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : critline ] .",
    "we have checked  @xcite that the presence of heavy quarks shifts this line slightly towards the smaller values of @xmath11 at low @xmath2 .",
    "similar behavior has been already observed in the gbw model  @xcite .",
    "let us also point out that the critical line presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : critline ] is very similar to that obtained by soyez  @xcite in the modified iancu , itakura and munier ( imm ) model  @xcite with heavy quarks ( see @xcite and @xcite for the precise , slightly different , definitions of the critical lines ) .",
    "we have shown that the dglap improved saturation model with heavy quarks provides successful description of a considerable number of quantities measured in dis .",
    "in particular , it predicts correctly the charm and beauty contributions to the proton structure function .",
    "this result is quite remarkable given the simplicity of the framework we use .",
    "this may suggest that the @xmath37 factorization is a more efficient way of approaching dis at small @xmath2 ( see also  @xcite ) or be considered as an argument supporting the idea of saturation at hera .",
    "i would like to express my gratitude to krzysztof golec - biernat with whom this work has been done .",
    "it is also a pleasure to thank leszek for numerous valuable discussions during this workshop .",
