    "the growth in debt illustrated by the above charts has a profound impact upon economic performance that is neglected by conventional economic analysis , which ignores the role of monetary factors in economics .    aggregate demand in an economy for everything from commodities to assets  technically , gross national expenditure  is the sum of income and the change in debt . when debt levels are low compared to gdp , the contribution from change in debt is negligible , and this monetary side of the economy can comfortably be ignored .",
    "but when debt levels become large compared to gdp , much of the effective demand  and the majority of the volatility in economic performance -- is driven by changes in debt .",
    "monetary factors are no longer economically irrelevant .",
    "australia s recent economic history clearly illustrates this shift from an economy where monetary factors can be ignored , to one where they are dominant .    as noted above , australia s debt to gdp history is closer to the mean for all oecd countries than that of the usa .",
    "also , even though australia s economy is currently performing well , while america s is now feared to be in recession after the collapse of the subprime market , australia s economic history also provides a clearer example than america of a speculation - dominated economy .    in the 1950s and early 1960s , when australia s private debt was less than 25% of gdp , annual changes in debt contributed less than 5 percent to gross national expenditure .",
    "that changed markedly in 1973 , when the first and smallest of three recent \" super - bubbles \" in debt occurred ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "briefly , the change in debt that year accounted for 10 percent of nominal gne ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "simultaneously , the great 1970s inflationary surge began , and unemployment in australia exploded from its previous historic level of below two percent , to over six percent .",
    "most economists blamed the downturn on poor government economic policy and inflation , but the real cause was the collapse in speculative bubble that the growth in debt had financed . with the bubble over , speculators shifted from willingly taking on debt , to trying desperately to reduce it .",
    "the rate of growth of debt fell well below the rate of inflation , and the change in debt went from boosting real aggregate demand to subtracting from it .",
    "the australian economy went into its first post - wwii recession  caused by a decrease in the rate of growth of private debt .",
    "the dependence on debt became even more extreme as debt rose from 44% of gdp in 1973 to 85% in 1990 , during the next debt super - bubble .",
    "at the peak of that bubble , increases in private debt accounted for almost 14% of aggregate demand .",
    "this was a huge credit - driven boost to the economy while it lasted , but when it went into reverse the change in debt turned negative , and reductions in debt reduced nominal gne by almost 1.5 percent .",
    "real gne fell by substantially more , since inflation dropped along with the fall in debt .",
    "the economy entered into its deepest post - wwii recession yet , with unemployment exceeding 11 percent .",
    "we face the dilemma that with high debt levels , economic performance becomes dependent on the further accumulation of debt . when debt is small , or changing by only small amounts , most variation in economic performance is due to real productive factors .",
    "but when debt is much larger than output , changes in debt contribute disproportionately to changes in apparent economic performance .",
    "ironically , superficially good economic performance  such as falling unemployment -- becomes dependent on ultimately unsustainable further increases in debt .",
    "this is apparent in the correlation between unemployment and change in debt in the australian data . in the 50s and 60s , when debt was under 25% of gdp , changes in debt made a comparatively small contribution to changes in effective demand , and hence the correlation between changes in debt and changes in unemployment was small ( and positive ) .",
    "however , as debt rose relative to gdp , changes in debt made a much larger contribution to changes in effective demand , and hence to changes in unemployment .",
    "the correlation between changes in debt and changes in unemployment consequently increased in magnitude as debt accumulated over time .",
    "now , that correlation has stabilized at more than -90 percent -- which means that a decline in the rate of growth of debt is highly likely to be correlated with an increase in the level of unemployment ( see figures 5 and 7 ) .",
    "a similar observation applies to the american economy ( see figures 6 and 7 ) .",
    "the correlation of changes in private debt with unemployment is more volatile than in the australian case  in part because of the comparatively massive contributions from changes in government and financial sector debt to american demand .",
    "but clearly the australian and american economies , in concert with 13 other major oecd nations , have become \" addicted to debt \" .",
    "this is the most conventionally economic danger facing the world economy as the us subprime crisis spreads .",
    "as households go from willingly taking on more debt to trying to reduce their indebtedness , the change in debt will go from boosting aggregate demand to subtracting from it .",
    "the 1990s collapse in debt levels caused unemployment in australia to rise from six to eleven percent  yet in 1990 , the change in debt was responsible for \" only \" 14 percent of gne .",
    "today , it accounts for over 18 percent of gne .",
    "similarly in the usa , when the debt - driven component of nominal gne dropped from 10 to 2 percent across the 1990s recession , unemployment rose from 5 to almost 8 percent . today , increasing debt accounts for 14 percent of us gne  and the subprime crisis clearly marks the end of this latest and biggest debt bubble .",
    "the macroeconomic impact of the switch from expanding to contracting debt levels is likely to result in the deepest recession in the usa s post - wwii economic history .",
    "since so much of the oecd is in a similar debt - driven state to america , the turnaround in debt that is occurring there is likely to be replicated across much of the oecd .",
    "it is therefore highly likely that at least an oecd - wide recession will occur , if not a global recession .",
    "if so , this will be the first time in romania s post - revolution economic history that external economic conditions have been contractionary rather than expansionary .",
    "what are the implications of this for romania itself ?",
    "obviously this depends to some extent on the level of indebtedness in romania . here , definitive and timely data is difficult to come by . the best we could locate was the oecdstat database ( http://stats.oecd.org/wbos/default.aspx?usercontext=sourceoecd ) , where annual data to 2006 implies that romania s aggregate debt to gdp ratio is even worse than that for the usa , both in terms of magnitude and its rate of increase .",
    "this suggests that romania could face a debt - driven downturn in aggregate demand when the rate of change of debt falls , in addition to a diminution in export demand .",
    "long term australian economic data implies that this will be no ordinary recession .",
    "australia s reserve bank assembled a long term data series on the debt to gdp ratio , which shows that australia s economic performance since 1965 has been driven by a debt bubble which is the third and by far the biggest in its economic history .",
    "it is likely that the same applies to the usa : that today s private debt levels are the largest in the history of capitalism , and that what we are experiencing now is a repeat of the processes that gave rise to earlier financial panics .    as mark twain famously remarked ,",
    "\" history does nt repeat , but it sure does rhyme \" , and australia s economic history gives strong reason to expect something far more severe than a mere recession .",
    "the bursting of australia s two previous historic debt bubbles-in 1892 and 1931 - -ushered in not merely recessions , but depressions ( long term data on real gdp growth , money supply change and inflation implies that the usa also experienced a depression in the 1890s -- see keen 2008a ) . yet",
    "the debt levels then were substantially less than today s .",
    "it appears that the existence of central banks that , as in the case of the us s federal reserve , respond to financial crises by trying to \" save the private sector from itself \" , may actually have contributed to a \" moral hazard \" dilemma that has allowed debt levels to exceed previous bounds .",
    "if history is any guide , then without central bank activism-such as the rescue of long term capital management , and the aggressive cutting of reserve rates during the 1990s recession  it is likely that the 1990s bubble would have marked the peak of private debt accumulation ( at 125 percent of gdp for the usa , and 85 percent for australia ) .",
    "that in itself would have been bad enough , given the historical record  given the aftermaths of the previous two bubbles .",
    "but with today s debt levels , we truly are in unprecedented territory .",
    "we are not saying that a global depression is inevitable , because there are other aspect of the modern economic and social system that differ substantially to that of 1930 and 1890 .",
    "bank collapses and the destruction of depositors savings , which were a feature of the 1890s in australia ( and the 1930s in america ) , will not recur ; and government social security payments during a downturn will provide  households with cash flows that can be used to service debt , something that did not happen in 1930 .",
    "but there will inevitably be an extended period of reduced vitality to aggregate demand , as income is channeled to pay debt levels down from today s unprecedented levels to something closer to the 20 - 60 percent of gdp level that appears sustainable in the long run . in australia and america s cases ,",
    "such a reduction in private debt would require more than an entire year s gdp to be directed simply at debt reduction .",
    "since that can not be done in one hit , this implies a long period where demand will grow more slowly than capacity to produce output rises .",
    "the australian long term data indicates that there is something systemic in western economies that leads to periodic debt explosions , and subsequent serious debt - driven downturns . the most cogent theory to explain this phenomenon is the \" financial instability hypothesis \" , which was developed by the american economist hyman minsky in the late 1950s and early 1960s ( see keen 1995 , 2008b ) . a key aspect of minsky s model was the existence of \" ponzi financing \" , in which individual speculators  use borrowed money to buy assets , and then attempt to profit by selling them to other speculators for a higher price .",
    "this behavior is dependent on asset prices rising faster than commodity prices , and requires that debt rise faster still  and this has clearly been the case in most oecd economies in the last 3 decades .",
    "this in turn requires a financial system that willingly generates debt , up to a point at which the debt burden causes a crisis that suddenly stems the flow of credit  a \" credit crunch \" .",
    "conventional models of money creation -- which argue that the banking system does no more than amplify the monetary creation processes of the central bank  cannot explain this process , and in any case fail to account for the empirical data which shows that credit money creation actually precedes the creation of central bank money by up to one year ( kydland and prescott 1990 ) . a far more cogent explanation is given by the circuitist school model of endogenous money creation ( graziani 1989 , 2004 ) .",
    "recently one of us ( keen 2007 ) has developed a mathematical model of this process in a pure credit economy .",
    "the model explains how money is endogenously created , why banks are motivated to extend credit indefinitely , and what happens to aggregate demand when a credit crunch occurs .",
    "it is easily developed from a \" double - entry book - keeping \" table of the flows between accounts that are initiated by a loan from a bank to a firm to finance production .",
    "the model is developed in more detail in keen 2008c ( see also chapman & keen 2006 ) . here",
    "we will stick with a simpler presentation for the sake of exposition .",
    "a bank loan to a firm creates two accounts : a record of debt _ _",
    "f__@xmath0 , and a deposit account for the firm _ _ f__@xmath1 .",
    "an initial loan thus instantly creates a matching deposit , and also sets up interest payment obligations between the bank and the firm : the firm is obliged to pay interest on the outstanding debt , while the bank is obliged to pay interest on the current level of the firm s deposit account ( the rates differ of course , with the rate of interest on loans _ _",
    "r__@xmath2 exceeding that on deposits _",
    "_ r__@xmath3 . ) .",
    "the funds flow between the firm s and the bank s deposit accounts , as shown in the first row of table one .",
    "table one : a model of endogenous money creation    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < ,",
    "< , < , < \" , ]     once the firm has money it its deposit account , it can hire workers to produce output .",
    "the flow of wages from firms to workers goes into the workers deposit account _ _ w__@xmath3 ; this is the second row in the table .",
    "workers therefore have positive bank balances , and they too receive interest on these balances from the bank ; this is the third row in the table .    workers and",
    "bankers then buy commodities from the firm , resulting in expenditure flows from the _",
    "_ b__@xmath3 and _ _ w__@xmath1 accounts to the firm s deposit account _ _ f__@xmath3 : this is the fourth row in the table . the arguments and represent the rates of flow per annum out of each account , relative to the balances at any time .",
    "the next row in the table explains how money is endogenously created . in the real world , firms negotiate lines of credit with banks , which enable them to undertake expenditures -- and thus effectively create money in the accounts of other firms -- which the banks record as a matching increase in their outstanding debt levels . in the aggregate , this results in a simultaneous increase in firms deposits and firms recorded debt levels . unlike the previous rows in the table , this results in a net increase in both bank liabilities  the sum of outstanding bank deposits  and bank assets .",
    "the argument _",
    "_ n__@xmath4 represents the rate at which the money supply expands each year .",
    "the next two rows record loan repayment flows from firms to banks , and the flow of bank reserves from banks to firms -- effectively , therecycling  of loans that have previously been repaid .",
    "both these transaction flows involve transfers from the liability to the asset side of the bank s ledger , but on the asset side itself they simply result in the form of assets changing : from loans ( which generate an income flow to the bank ) to reserves ( which , being inactive , do not generate an income flow to the bank ) . the arguments _",
    "_ r__@xmath0 and _ _ l__@xmath5 represent the annual rate of loan repayment and the annual rate of reserve recycling per annum respectively .",
    "we can now derive a dynamic model of endogenous money creation simply by adding up the columns  in the above table .",
    "each column represents the flows into and out of a given account .",
    "we thus have the following set of coupled differential equations describing the basic dynamics of money creation in a pure credit economy :    @xmath6    the model can now be used to explain why banks are predisposed to generate as much credit as borrowers are willing to absorb up until a debt crisis occurs , and also to show what happens when the system shifts from expanding credit to a credit crunch .",
    "on the first issue , bank income rises if the rate of money creation _ _ n__@xmath4 and the rate of loan recycling _ _ l__@xmath5 rise , while it falls if the rate of loan repayment _ _ r__@xmath0 rises .",
    "banks therefore have a vested interest in increasing the rate of money creation , increasing the rate of recicrulation of their reserves , and discouraging borrowers from repaying loans .    of course",
    ", as current economic conditions are now reminding us , this state of affairs does not persist when loan defaults grow , and banks become concerned that lending more money will lead not to more profits , but to capital losses .",
    "the shift in sentiment we can now see in the usa , from profligate lending to a credit crunch , involves a reversal in the above three key parameters : banks reduce the rate at which they create new money , the recirculation of existing reserves slows , and borrowers try to reduce their indebtedness .",
    "figures 10 and 11 show this process with a doubling of the rate at which borrowers attempt to repay loans , and a halving of both the rate of recirculation of existing loans and of the rate of creation of new money.=5% ; _ _ r__@xmath3=3% ; = 1 ; = 26 ; _ _",
    "n__@xmath4=10% _ _ r__@xmath0=2 ; and _ _ l__@xmath5=2 . ] the effect is a precipitous drop in money in circulation-which necessarily reduces the rate of economic activity .",
    "bank assets nonetheless continue to grow ( though extending the model to include bankruptcy would change this detail ) , but there is a dramatic shift from active assets ( loans ) to inactive ones ( reserves ) .",
    "the system does stabilize and return to growth after a relatively short period , but this is at a dramatically lower level of both active money and economic activity .",
    "clearly , a process like this is currently underway in the usa , and given the interconnectedness of the world financial system and the extent to which the rest of the oecd is also debt - encumbered , it is only a matter of time before the same process manifests itself worldwide .",
    "there will be attenuating effects from countries which are net global creditors  such as china and japan  or which have not indulged in the orgy of ponzi financing ( such as france ) , but these are unlikely to be sufficient to counter the negative impact of both the credit crunch , and the macroeconomic impact of debt reduction on aggregate demand .",
    "romania , having only just completed the transition from a socialist to a market economy , may therefore have to prepare itself for yet another economic shock as the global capitalist system becomes mired in a debt trap .",
    "we can have some modern guidance as to what this might mean for the economy from the experience of japan , which as noted earlier , is an important exception to the general debt to gdp rule indicated in figure two .",
    "this is because though , from the graph , japan has the lowest rate of growth of debt relative to gdp , this is only because japan entered a debt - deflation seventeen years ago , when its bubble economy collapsed at the end of the 1980s .",
    "japan s private debt to gdp ratio has fallen substantially since 1990though the oecd stat figures are not directly comparable to the australian and us data used above , they still imply a more than 20 percent fall in the ratio since its peak .",
    "but this has been bought at the cost of a seriously depressed economy , as shown by the oecd s composite leading indicators ( cli ) , which indicate current living standards and allow cross - country comparisons to be made .    whereas japan was far ahead of the usa on the cli scale in 1990 , when the bubble economy collapsed ,",
    "japan s economic performance stalled  and by 2004 , american living standards had moved ahead of japan s .",
    "japanese living standards today are no better than they were a decade earlier  whereas previously , living standards improved by up to 50 percent every decade .",
    "there are doubtless other factors that have contributed to this stagnation , but the debt crisis of the early 1990s and its long - running aftermath are key to understanding why , in 1990 , the sun stopped rising in the land of the rising sun .",
    "when japan s crisis occurred , many western economists blamed it on the lack of transparency of the western ( and in particular , american ) financial system , and argued that japan s crisis simply could nt occur in the west , because of its higher financial standards and superior financial innovation . today s",
    "crisis may show that this was simply american hubris : japan s 1990s crisis was caused by a speculative bubble focused on real estate , and america has clearly followed suit in the subsequent decades .",
    "though a market economy is clearly preferable to a centrally planned one from romania s own experience , there is something somewhat insane in a system that allows itself to be periodically despoiled by pointless speculation on housing , and excessive debt accumulation . is this phenomenon something that one must accept as inevitably a part of a capitalist system , or is there something that could be done to stop , or at least attenuate , this process in the future",
    "?    there are ways in which some financial instability in capitalism is inevitable . as minsky once remarked , \" stability is destabilizing \" , because a period of tranquil growth leads investors to revise their risk expectations , thus leading to accelerating growth and the accumulation of debt",
    ".    however , much of the long - term runup in debt has nothing to do with actual investment , but instead involves pure speculation on asset prices .",
    "this in turn is possible because , when an asset bubble takes hold , a disconnect develops between asset prices and the income flows those assets generate : share prices rise much faster than corporate earnings , while house prices rise faster than the rents .",
    "we need some means to attenuate the willingness of banks to fund speculation on shares and houses when such bubbles arise .      at present , if a borrower defaults on a mortgage , then the lender gets ownership of the house , and can sell it for whatever it can fetch on the market .",
    "however , it would be possible to reform lending laws so that the financial limit of the security the lender received was some sensible multiple of the ( actual or imputed ) rental income from the property .",
    "lenders would still be able to lend as much as they wished to a borrower , but would share some of the risk if he overextended himself .",
    "it is feasible that this sharing of risk could reduce the \" moral hazard \" that the current system generates , and thereby reduce the supply of credit to fund real estate speculation .    while this is not as radical a change as the move from a socialist to a capitalist economy that romania",
    "has already undertaken , such changes tend to be very hard to achieve in a capitalist economy because of the political power of lenders , and the many vested interests in real estate",
    ". however surely such a change is worth contemplating if the alternative is a fiasco like the usa s current subprime crisis , and an extended depression like that which still dominates japan today ."
