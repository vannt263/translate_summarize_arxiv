    "ultra - relativistic electrons accelerated through magnetic fields generate electromagnetic radiation , called synchrotron radiation ( sr ) . emission from sr sources may range from far infrared ( fir ) to x - ray frequencies .",
    "the use of proper physical quantities and figures of merit enable their adequate characterization and deep understanding .",
    "the properties of a sr source are usually described using three quantities : the spectral flux , the maximum of the angular spectral flux and the brightness @xcite-@xcite . among these quantities",
    "the brightness has a very important role .",
    "the physical meaning of brightness can be best understood by considering the imaging of the source on any experimental sample .",
    "typically , only a small fraction of the photons in the beam can be effectively focused .",
    "the brightness is an appropriate figure of merit for estimating the photon flux density on the sample , and was originally defined with the help of traditional radiometry .",
    "traditional radiometry is based on a geometrical optics approach .",
    "the basic quantity in this discipline is the radiance , which measures a spectral photon flux per unit area per unit projection solid angle .",
    "since the radiance can be evaluated at any point along a photon beamline , it is associated with specific locations within an optical system , including an image plane where , usually , an experimental sample is placed .",
    "all other radiometric units can be derived from the radiance integrating over area or solid angle . integrating over the solid angle yields a spatial flux . integrating over the area yields the angular flux . integrating over both area and solid angle yields total flux @xcite . in this picture , the radiance is the photon flux density in phase space . in non - dissipative cases",
    "where liouville theorem holds , the radiance is an invariant quantity down the photon beamline .",
    "the main issue with this concept stems from the fact that traditional radiometry only provides a natural description of the properties of light from incoherent sources .",
    "second generation sr sources are characterized by poor transverse coherence , and application of the concept of radiance to sr allows for phase space analysis of the x - ray radiation . for these sources",
    "the brightness is nothing more than the radiance .",
    "however , with the advent of third generation sr sources , electron beams began to have ultra - small emittances and quantities used in traditional radiometry needed to be generalized to sr sources of arbitrary state of transverse coherence .",
    "the question then arises whether it is possible to find a definition of brightness that , irrespective of the state of coherence of the sr source , has all properties that one normally associates with it in the geometrical optics limit .",
    "the basic question concerning the characterization of third generation sr sources is the definition of brightness in terms of electromagnetic fields , and their statistical properties ( i.e on the basis of classical relativistic electrodynamics and statistical optics ) .",
    "we begin our discussion with the generalization of the brightness definition first proposed by kim @xcite , which is essentially the wigner distribution ( wd ) @xcite of the sr electric field . in @xcite ,",
    "the characteristics of the odd harmonics field from undulator sources in resonance approximation was analyzed in detail using the wd formalism .",
    "the wd was explicitly derived both in the diffraction limited regime and in the electron beam size- and divergence - dominated regime .",
    "after kim s pioneering papers @xcite no further theoretical progress was made .",
    "in particular , the considerations by kim @xcite on bending magnet and wiggler brightness in terms of the wd formalism were not further developed into a satisfactory theory .    in literature , the brightness of a sr source is sometimes defined as the wigner distribution itself , i.e. as a phase space quasi - probability function @xcite . as such , for sr sources of arbitrary state of transverse coherence , it is not guaranteed to be positive .",
    "moreover it is convenient to introduce a figure of merit which always gives back a single , positive number and can serve , at the same time , as a measure for the wd . in this article",
    "we shall define the brightness for any synchrotron source as the maximum value of the wd .",
    "note that the brightness defined in this way is always a positive quantity .",
    "we can regard it as a self - evident generalization of kim s choice of the on - axis peak value of the wd as a figure of merit for the undulator case but , surprisingly , we failed to find it in literature .    in the following of this section we present an introductory discussion of brightness of synchrotron radiation sources in general .",
    "then , in section [ oldres ] we give a summary of results in literature , and an overview of novel findings . in section [ sec : due ] we discuss an analysis of undulator brightness , and of the approximations proposed by kim @xcite . in the limiting cases where the geometrical optics treatment can still be applied , but only the electron beam size or the divergence dominate on the diffraction size and angle we find a significant numerical disagreement between exact and approximated calculations . in section [ sec : tre ]",
    "we come to the new results and extend the wd formalism to a satisfactory theory of bending magnet brightness .",
    "as already discussed , we will focus on the description of a sr source in terms of wd",
    ". we will be interested in the case of an ultra relativistic electron beam going through a certain magnetic system .",
    "we will discuss of an undulator to illustrate our reasoning , but the considerations in this section , being fully general , apply to any other magnetic system ( wiggler , bending magnet ) as well .",
    "sr theory is naturally developed in the space - frequency domain , as one is usually interested into radiation properties at a given position in space at a certain frequency . in this article",
    "we define the relation between temporal and frequency domain via the following definition of fourier transform pairs :    @xmath3    we call @xmath4 the observation distance along the optical axis of the system and @xmath5 fixes the transverse position of the observer .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath6-th electron to the field depends on the transverse offset @xmath7 and deflection angles @xmath8 that the electron has at some reference point on the optical axis @xmath4 e.g. the center of the undulator , that we will take as @xmath9",
    ". moreover , the arrival time @xmath10 at position @xmath9 has the effect of multiplying the electric field in space - frequency domain by a phase factor @xmath11 , @xmath12 being the frequency .",
    "any fixed polarization component of the total field in the space frequency domain , which is a scalar quantity , can therefore be written as    @xmath13    where @xmath8 , @xmath7 and @xmath10 are random variables , and @xmath14 is the number of electrons in the bunch .",

    "( [ total ] ) is a complex quantity , and can be written as @xmath16 , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 real numbers .",
    "it follows that the sr field at a fixed frequency and position is a sum of many phasors , one for each electron , of the form @xmath19 .",
    "elementary phasors composing the sum obey three important statistical properties , that are satisfied in all sr problems of interest .",
    "first , random variables @xmath10 are statistically independent of each other , and of variables @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "this assumption follows from the properties of shot noise in a storage ring , which is a fundamental effect related with quantum fluctuations .",
    "second , the amplitudes @xmath20 have obviously finite mean @xmath21 and finite second moment @xmath22 .",
    "third , we assume that the electron bunch duration @xmath23 is large enough so that @xmath24 . under these non - restrictive assumptions",
    "the phases @xmath25 can be regarded as uniformly distributed on the interval @xmath26 . moreover , with the help of the central limit theorem , it can be demonstrated that real and imaginary parts of @xmath27 are distributed in accordance to a gaussian law .",
    "it follows that sr is gaussian random process .",
    "moreover , since one deals with pulses of finite duration , the process is intrinsically non - stationary .",
    "an important consequence of the fact that the sr random process can be considered gaussian is that higher - order correlation functions can be expressed in terms of the second order correlation function with the help of the moment theorem @xcite .    as a result",
    ", the knowledge of the second - order correlation function in the space - frequency domain is all we need to completely characterize the signal from a statistical viewpoint .",

    "schell s model sources are defined by the condition that there is some position down the beamline , which we will call @xmath9 without loss of generality , such that their cross - spectral density ( note that eq .",
    "( [ coore ] ) is defined at any position @xmath4 down the beamline ) is of the form    @xmath64    equivalently , one may simply define schell s model sources using the condition that the spectral degree of coherence depends on the positions across the source only through the difference @xmath65 .",
    "quasi - homogeneous sources are schell s sources obeying the extra assumption that @xmath66 varies so slowly with position that it is approximately constant over distances across the source , which are of the order of the correlation length , which is the effective width of @xmath67 . because of this , for quasi - homogeneous sources we are allowed to make the approximation    @xmath68    where now @xmath69 is proportional to the intensity distribution at the source . by definition ,",
    "quasi - homogeneous synchrotron sources obey a very particular kind of random process that is spatially ergodic .",

    "we come to the conclusion , to be used in the following of this section , that the 2d fourier transform of @xmath67 is always a positive quantity as function of variables @xmath72 , @xmath73 is given by @xmath74 . here",

    "we regard it as a distribution function defined over the four dimensions @xmath91 and parameterized by @xmath4 .",
    "let us now specialize the expression in eq .",

    "this analysis shows that quasi - homogeneous sources can always be characterized in terms of geometrical optics .",
    "it also shows that in this particular case the coordinates in phase space , @xmath5 and @xmath97 , are separable . in the case of non quasi - homogeneous sources",

    "our source , placed in the middle of the undulator , is obviously virtual in nature .",

    "we should remark that statistical optics is the only mean to deal , in general , with the stochastic nature of sr . only in those particular cases",

    "one of these cases is described above for the electron beam size- and divergence - dominated regime .    in all generality , in order to decide whether geometrical optics or wave optics is applicable , one should separately compare the electron beam sizes and divergences at the electron beam waist position with the radiation diffraction sizes and diffraction angles , which are quantities pertaining the single - electron radiation .",
    "when at least the electron beam size or divergence dominates , one can use a geometrical optics approach .",
    "as we have seen , quasi - homogeneity is a necessary and sufficient condition for geometrical optics to be used in the representation of any sr source .",
    "a source is quasi - homogeneous if and only if it is possible to factorize the cross - spectral density @xmath92 in the product of two factors separately depending on @xmath5 and @xmath78 .",
    "for example , in the particular case when the electron beam size dominates over diffraction , the cross - spectral density @xmath92 ( and hence also the wigner distribution ) admits factorization , and the source can still be described with the help of geometrical optics even if the divergence is dominated by diffraction effects : in that case , since the source is quasi - homogeneous , the fourier transform of the spectral degree of coherence @xmath67 yields a diffraction limited intensity distribution in the far zone .",

    "other books like @xcite discuss only the geometrical limit , and @xcite presents a qualitative treatment . only @xcite try to give a complete analysis of the problem .",
    "part of the difficulty of applying the concept of brightness to the bending magnet case can be traced back to attempts using a mixture of intuitive geometrical optics and wave optics considerations , instead of exact results as was done in the undulator case .",
    "a typical example of such intuitive description can be found in @xcite : `` to calculate the bending magnet brightness we need to consider the effective phase space which the photon flux is being emitted taking into account of both the finite electron and photon beam sizes and divergences .",

    "similarly to the undulator case , the angular divergence and source size for the radiation emitted by a single electron is chosen to satisfy @xmath196 .",
    "it is instructive to examine this expression in diffraction limited case . from eq .",
    "( [ btext ] ) we then find    @xmath197    if the horizontal opening angle of the beamline , that is the half - angle subtended by the aperture in horizontal direction @xmath198 , is larger than @xmath178 , then the flux increases proportionally to @xmath198 .",
    "however , in the limit for @xmath199 the brightness becomes independent of the beamline opening angle .",
    "it is often noted that the factor @xmath176 is the minimal phase space volume of a diffraction limited beam .",
    "therefore one can summarize by saying that sr emitted from a bending magnet within a solid angle of order @xmath200 occupies the minimal phase space volume @xmath176 .",
    "the physical interpretation of the effect mentioned above can be found , among other references , in the review paper @xcite , where the brightness of the radiation from a bending magnet is described in the language of geometrical optics .",
    "this language is intrinsically inadequate to describe the focusing of diffraction - limited radiation from a bending magnet .",
    "in fact , this physical phenomenon fully pertains wave optics .",
    "it is however possible to use geometrical optics reasoning and obtain an intuitive understanding of the situation . later on in this work we will show that such intuitive understanding is in qualitative agreement with an analysis fully based on wave optics . a complication in determining the brightness is the correlation between the longitudinal position of the source along the bending magnet and the ( horizontal ) angle of observation in the far zone .",
    "an important parameter that is required to calculate the brightness is the source area .",
    "in general , citing @xcite almost literally : `` there are three contributions to the horizontal source size and these are ( 1 ) the intrinsic size of the electron beam itself ( in our notation @xmath201 ) ; ( 2 ) the projected ( observed ) size due to the large horizontal sweep angle @xmath198 , leading to an extended source ( equal to the sagitta @xmath202 ) ; and ( 3 ) the diffraction limited source size . we can estimate the diffraction limited source size as @xmath203 '' .",
    "the effective source size is then found by adding the three sizes in quadrature , thus    @xmath204^{1/2 } ~. \\label{totsize}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    finally , it is worth emphasizing that if the horizontal opening angles @xmath198 is larger than the diffraction angle @xmath178 , the projected source size increases more rapidly @xmath205 than the flux @xmath206 @xcite .    in literature",
    "one can often find that the brightness is strictly linked to transverse coherence properties of the radiation and that the coherent flux @xmath207 can be defined as    @xmath208    note that the common understanding that the coherence flux available after spatial filtering can always be written as eq .",
    "( [ fcoh ] ) is erroneous .",
    "for example , as we discussed above , the brightness of the radiation from a bending magnet in the diffraction limited case is constant when @xmath198 is larger than the diffraction angle @xmath178 .",
    "however , in this situation the coherent flux increases proportionally to the horizontal opening angle @xmath198 . in fact , the entire photon flux collected from a diffraction limited source is fully transversely coherent . a young s double pinhole interferometer",
    "can be used for demonstrating this fact . in the case of a diffraction limited source , the interference pattern recorded by the interferometer",
    "is always characterized by a @xmath209 fringe contrast .",
    "the physical meaning of brightness can be best understood by considering the imaging of the source on an experimental sample .",
    "radiation is usually concentrated by using a wide - aperture focusing optical system .",
    "the brightness is a figure of merit that quantifies how well a sr beam can be focused . for this purpose",
    "one considers an ideal optical system .",
    "in fact , in general , the maximum photon flux density onto the image plane is altered by optical elements along the setup .",
    "we may interpret the brightness @xmath210 as the theoretical maximum concentration of the sr photon flux on the image - receiving surface where , usually , the sample is placed .",
    "the source size can be affected by the presence of a finite electron beam .",
    "it is often noted that the coherent part of the total flux can be ultimately focused down to a spot - size of dimension @xmath176 .",
    "such consideration thus leads , at least qualitatively , to the relation between brightness and coherent fraction of total flux given by eq .",
    "( [ fcoh ] ) .",
    "it is clear that even a fully coherent beam can be of ` bad quality ' in the sense that a only small fraction of photons in the beam can be focused to a spot - size of dimension @xmath176 .",
    "this is the case when the radiation source is characterized by a complicated wavefront , which has an effect similar to optics abberation , when there is a departure of the far field wavefront from the ideal spherical form .",
    "then , one can not reach an effective focusing on the sample even in the diffraction limited case .",
    "it is well - known that , in general , there are two different characteristics of the radiation beam .",
    "the first one is the degree of transverse coherence @xmath211 , which reflects the statistical properties of radiation fields @xcite .",
    "the second one is the well - known @xmath212 factor , which is widely used in the laser community to quantify how well a deterministic laser beam can be focused @xcite .",
    "the diffraction - limited photon beam from an undulator has an @xmath212 factor close to unity and eq .",
    "( [ fcoh ] ) is correct . at variance",
    ", the diffraction - limited photon beam from a bending magnet has an @xmath212 factor close to unity only within a solid angle of about @xmath213 .",
    "the brightness is a useful figure of merit that incorporates , simultaneously , both the statistical properties and the wavefront qualities of the radiation pulse .",
    "when the electron beam has zero emittance we are dealing with perfectly coherent wavefronts . intuitively , in this situation one would apply methods from wave optics in order to solve the image formation problem . at variance , in literature it is often discussed an estimation of the source size for the case of diffraction limited radiation from a bending magnet based on geometrical optics @xcite .",
    "a situation where one deals with a similar problem is in the calculation of a laser beam focus through a lens , when severe aberrations are present .",
    "although the laser beam is coherent , when diffraction effects are negligible compared to aberration effects , the beam focusing can be calculated with the help of geometrical optics considerations . in the geometrical optics limit",
    ", the wave equation can be replaced with the eikonal equation , which should be solved for surfaces of equal phase .",
    "once the function of equal phase is known , one can apply usual ray - tracing techniques remembering that rays are , at any point , normal to the surface with equal phase .",
    "the similarity between the two situations is highlighted by the essential feature of a diffraction limited sr beam from a bending magnet : at beamline opening angles @xmath199 wavefront ` aberrations ' are present in the sense discussed above , departure of the far field wavefront from the ideal spherical form can be considered as a coma - like aberration . ] , and are severe , meaning that @xmath214 .",
    "therefore , a geometrical optics approximation , leading in particular to ray - tracing techniques , can be applied to the analysis of the image formation problem .    before proceeding",
    "we should make a few remarks concerning the terminology used in relation to brightness treatments .",
    "the theory of brightness for a bending magnet is much more difficult than that for an undulator .",
    "one can now see a net distinction between the geometrical optics limit in the framework of statistical optics when one discusses about an incoherent ( i.e. quasi - homogeneous ) sr source and the geometrical optics limit in the framework of coherent fourier optics , when one discusses about highly ` aberrated ' beams radiated from a single electron in the bending magnet setup .",
    "an example where terminology is not accurately used can be found in @xcite : `` let us now turn to a more rigorous derivation of the source brightness of the synchrotron radiation due to a single electron . ... according to eq .",
    "( 31 ) , photons are emitted incoherently in the tangential direction at each point of the trajectory '' .",
    "it should be clear that one can talk about ` incoherently emitted ' photons only in the framework of statistical optics , when one deals with sr as random process . in the case of a single electron case we are always dealing with",
    "coherently emitted photons at each point of the trajectory .",
    "actually , the discussion in @xcite must be understood as an application of the geometrical optics approximation to the bending magnet radiation from a single electron in the case of large open angle , i.e when wavefront ` aberrations ' effects are dominant compared to diffraction effects .    up to this point",
    "our analysis of bending magnet brightness has followed that given in reviews @xcite and books @xcite on sr theory .",
    "it is now instructive to consider our approach , and examine its results in the diffraction limited case . with our definition of brightness",
    "we do not need to worry about how to account for the effect of sr beam ` aberrations ' .",
    "in fact , the essential feature of our method is that we derive the brightness of a diffraction limited sr beam from the expression for the maximum wigner distribution .",
    "clearly , the brightness defined in this way automatically includes a factor that characterizes the possibility of focusing the sr beam .",
    "let us indicate with @xmath215 the brightness given by the approximated expression eq .",

    "mathematically , our calculation is based on eq .",

    "( [ bmx ] ) is naturally different from the exact one , although the difference is not large .",
    "however , the fact remains that , at variance with the approximated case for undulator brightness , the usual estimate for the brightness of radiation from a bending magnet does not coincide with the exact result in the limit for a zero beam emittance .",
    "the best way to avoid this kind of difficulties is to use the wigner function formalism as in the undulator case . only in this way it is possible to give an expression for the brightness of radiation from a bending magnet that is logically consistent and a directly applicable formulation that can be used by sr beamline scientists .",
    "the most serious objection to approximation in eq .",
    "( [ btext ] ) is that this expression does not include the electron beam divergence in the horizontal direction .",

    "we deduced this result by applying a rigorous mathematical method , without any intuitive arguments .",
    "an intuitive way of understanding this property is to recall that due to wavefront ` aberrations ' , one has an @xmath212 factor close to unity only when considering radiation from a single electron emitted around the axis within a solid angle of about @xmath213 .",
    "suppose that the electron beam has a divergence characterized by @xmath181 and @xmath183 . in this case , from geometrical considerations",
    "it is evident that only a photon flux of order of    @xmath224    can , in principle , be focused down to area an area of order @xmath225 .",
    "therefore , the maximum photon flux density in phase space is proportional to the ratio of the flux in ( [ maxfoc ] ) and an effective phase space volume of order @xmath225 .",
    "we thus deduced the parametric dependence of the bending magnet brightness in the limiting case ( [ siglim ] ) by means of intuitive arguments , which are in agreement with the rigorous mathematical derivation of eq .",
    "( [ btocomp ] ) found within the wigner function formalism .",
    "one can see that on the one hand the intuitively reasonable idea that there is `` no need to consider any horizontal angle effects as the light is emitted smoothly over full horizontal angle of @xmath186 radians '' @xcite can lead to incorrect results . on the other hand , however , other intuitive arguments are in agreement with the wigner function formalism .",
    "only the existence of a rigorous , exact mathematical method guarantees a well - defined physical meaning for the brightness of a bending magnet .",
    "another argument that disqualifies eq .",

    "detailed mathematical analysis confirms such expectation .",
    "it can be seen that in this case , depending on the specific ratio between horizontal beam size and divergence , the brightness is described using functions with completely different parametric dependence . in particular , eq .",

    "( [ okour ] ) .      although we can always find the brightness by a rigorous mathematical method following the wigner function approach , it is sometimes possible to get exact results such as eq .",

    "finally , it is worth emphasizing that the horizontal opening angle @xmath552 is the angular dimension of a coherent area in the far zone .",

    "in particular , based on this intuitive reasoning we expect that in the asymptotic limit eq .",
