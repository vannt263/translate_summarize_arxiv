    "the cosmic dark ages ended with the formation of the first stars in 10@xmath110@xmath2 @xmath3   cosmological halos at @xmath4 2030 .",
    "besides ionizing the universe with intense uv flux and forming the first heavy elements , pop iii stars also determined the luminosities and spectra of primeval galaxies and may have been the origin of the supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) at the centers of most massive galaxies today . unfortunately , because they lie at the edge of the observable universe , individual pop iii stars will likely remain beyond the reach of direct observation for decades to come despite their enormous luminosities @xcite and new near infrared ( nir ) observatories such as _ jwst _ @xcite and the _ thirty meter telescope _ ( tmt ) .",
    "past numerical simulations have suggested that pop iii stars form in isolation in halos , with masses of 30300 @xmath3  @xcite , but more recent calculations point to the possibility of binaries @xcite , and perhaps small swarms of less massive 2040 @xmath3  stars @xcite .",
    "however , in spite of their increasing sophistication numerical simulations can not yet constrain the properties of the first stars , as they do not realistically bridge the gap between the formation and fragmentation of protostellar disks and their destruction by nascent stars up to a myr later .",
    "it may soon be possible to deduce the properties of pop iii stars from their supernova ( sn ) explosions .",
    "primordial stars from 1040 @xmath3  are thought to die in core - collapse sne while 140260 @xmath3  stars explode as pair - instability ( pi ) sne , extremely energetic thermonuclear explosions with up to 100 times the energy of type ia or ii sne @xcite .",
    "pop iii stars above 100 @xmath3  encounter the pair instability after central carbon burning , when thermal energy creates electron - positron pairs rather than providing pressure support against collapse @xcite .",
    "their cores subsequently contract , triggering explosive thermonuclear burning of o and si . above 140 @xmath3",
    "the energy released completely unbinds the star , with no compact remnant . at 260 @xmath3",
    "the core becomes so hot that alpha particles are photodisintegrated into free nucleons , consuming as much energy per unit mass as was released by all preceding burning , and the star collapses instead of exploding .",
    "pi sne such as sn 2007bi have now been discovered in the local universe @xcite , and the recent discovery that rotating pop iii stars can die as pi sne at masses as low as 65 @xmath3  may increase the number of such explosions at high redshifts by a factor of a few @xcite .    pop iii pi sne could be ideal probes of the primeval universe because they are 100,000 times brighter than their progenitors and the early galaxies in which they reside , and might be found by _",
    "jwst _ or in all - sky surveys by _ wfirst _ or the _ wide - field imaging surveyor for high - redshift _ ( _ wish _ ) .",
    "however , to determine if these events can be seen from earth , fully radiation - hydrodynamical simulations of pi sne must be performed in realistic circumstellar envelopes , whose opacity and interaction with the shock crucially shape the temperatures and spectra in the source frame , and thus the flux that is eventually redshifted into the nir .",
    "lyman absorption by neutral hydrogen prior to the era of reionization , which can absorb or scatter light from these ancient supernovae out of our line of sight , must also be taken into account for explosions at the earliest epochs .",
    "previous simulations of pi sne have not included these effects @xcite , and estimates of the redshift at which they can be detected have either been confined to @xmath5 15 ( the era of primitive galaxies rather than the epoch of first light ) or have been attempted at @xmath4 30 with only very approximate methods @xcite .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations of the nir light curves of pop iii pi sne . in @xmath6",
    "we describe our numerical method and in @xmath7 we present source frame light curves and spectra for 5 pi explosions . in @xmath8 nir",
    "light curves for these events are shown for several redshifts , and we discuss their detection limits in redshift .",
    "ccccc 150 & 72 & 1.62 & 9.0 & 0.07 + 175 & 84.4 & 1.74 & 21.3 & 0.70 + 200 & 96.7 & 1.84 & 33 & 5.09 + 225 & 103.5 & 3.33 & 46.7 & 16.5 + 250 & 124 & 2.25 & 69.2 & 37.9",
    "our calculations are done in four stages .",
    "first , we model the evolution and initial explosion of 150 , 175 , 200 , 225 , and 250 @xmath3  pop iii stars in the kepler code @xcite .",
    "second , the shock is propagated through the interior of the star , its surface , and then out into the surrounding medium with the radiation hydrodynamics code rage @xcite .",
    "we model radiation flows with grey flux - limited diffusion and evolve matter and radiation temperatures separately because they are not always in equilibrium .",
    "this physics enables us to better capture shock breakout ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as discussed in greater detail in @xcite .",
    "energy deposition in the gas due to the radioactive decay of @xmath9 , which powers the light curve at later times , is also included .",
    "we surround the star with a power - law wind profile with a total mass of 0.1 @xmath3 , in keeping with the general consensus that massive zero - metallicity stars do not exhibit much mass loss due to their pristine atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the wind profile is smoothly joined to the h ii region density profile of a massive pop iii star calculated with the zeus - mp code @xcite .",
    "zeus - mp also captures the ionization state of the wind due to uv radiation from the star , and therefore its opacity to radiation from the sn .",
    "because all five stars become red hypergiants and cease to emit ionizing radiation in the final few hundred kyr of their lives , the wind completely recombines by the time they explode while the low - density h ii region beyond it remains ionized .",
    "third , we construct spectra from the rage blast profiles with the spectrum code @xcite using atomic opacities from the los alamos oplib database @xcite .",
    "spectrum calculates continuum and line luminosities , absorption lines imprinted on the flux by the ejecta and envelope , and doppler shifts and time dilation due to relativistic expansion .",
    "finally , we convolve our spectra with lyman absorption by neutral clouds @xcite , cosmological redshifting , and filter response functions to calculate nir light curves . we summarize the properties of our explosions in table 1 .",
    "bolometric source frame luminosities are shown for all five explosions in figure [ fig : lcs ] .",
    "the shock is not visible to an external observer before breaking through the surface of the star because electrons in the intervening layers scatter the photons .",
    "when it reaches the surface , the shock abruptly accelerates in the steep density gradient , becoming even hotter and releasing a brilliant pulse of photons with peak luminosities above 10@xmath10 erg s@xmath11 , or 2500 times the luminosity of the milky way galaxy .",
    "the transient is mostly x - rays and hard uv , and its duration is related to the radius of the star , since photons emitted simultaneously from its poles and equator reach an observer at times that are separated by the time it takes light to cross the star .",
    "the temperature of the shock at breakout is @xmath12 10@xmath2 k. after the initial transient subsides , the luminosities gradually decline from 10@xmath13 erg s@xmath14 to 10@xmath15 erg s@xmath14 over 3 yr as gamma rays from the decay of @xmath9   formed during the explosion downscatter in energy and diffuse out through the ejecta .",
    "pair - instability sn light curves are powered at early times by the conversion of kinetic energy into thermal energy by the shock , and are thus far more luminous than type ia and ii sne because they have much higher explosion energies . at later times",
    "they are primarily powered by radioactive decay , and they remain much brighter than other sne because they have synthesized more @xmath9 : up to 50 @xmath3  compared to 0.40.8 @xmath3  and @xmath16 0.3 @xmath3  in type ia and ii sne , respectively .",
    "they are luminous for longer times ( 3 yr instead of 36 mo for type ia and ii sne ) because radiation diffusion timescales in their more massive ejecta are longer : @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is the average opacity of the ejecta , m@xmath19 is the mass of the ejecta , and @xmath20 is the explosion energy .",
    "all five light curves slightly rebrighten at 4 months when the photosphere ( the surface from which photons stream freely into space ) recedes into the hot @xmath9  layer deep in the ejecta .",
    "this emission peaks at @xmath12 3000  , and its luminosity increases with the mass of @xmath9 , and hence the mass of the progenitor .",
    "rebrightening occurs later in more massive stars because more time is required for the photosphere to sink into the @xmath9  in the frame of the shock .",
    "figure [ fig : spectra ] shows spectra for the 225 @xmath3  explosion at four times ranging from shock breakout to 3 yr . as the fireball expands it cools , and its spectral peak advances to longer wavelengths .",
    "the breakout transient ionizes the envelope shrouding the star , as seen at 2.9 @xmath21 10@xmath1 s ( 3.4 days ) when the spectrum has far fewer absorption lines than at later times when the shock cools and can no longer fully ionize the wind . as the envelope recombines",
    "it imprints many more absorption lines on the spectrum , especially at shorter wavelengths where line blanketing effectively shears off the spectrum .",
    "consequently , the common practice of fitting blackbodies to bolometric light curves to approximate shock spectra can seriously overestimate the nir flux in the observer frame , because such profiles have a significant amount of flux at short wavelengths that is actually removed by the envelope and ejecta . on the other hand ,",
    "our bolometric luminosities are an order of magnitude higher at shock breakout than previous pi sn light curves because the shock crashes into the wind and heats it , and because radiation and matter are not forced to be in thermal equilibrium in our calculations . by 3",
    "yr most of the photons in the spectrum are below the ionization limit of hydrogen and pass through the envelope , although resonant scattering continues to imprint absorption lines on flux below this limit .",
    "at high redshift , lyman absorption will absorb most luminosity at wavelengths far blueward of 1216  .",
    "however , it could be possible that the fireball is brighter a little blueward of the lyman limit rather than a little redward , even with absorption . to determine in which _ jwst _ nircam filter an explosion is brightest at a given redshift , we calculate its nir signal at wavelengths above and below the lyman limit in the observer frame . at @xmath22 30",
    "we find that although all five sne are brighter just below 1216   in the source frame , igm absorption reduces these luminosities to magnitudes below those just redward of the limit for which there is no absorption , as we show for the 225 @xmath3  pi sn in figure [ fig : lya ] .",
    "the explosion is brighter at 1148   in the source frame ( 3.56 @xmath23 m in the observer frame ) at early times than at 1432   ( 4.44 @xmath23 m in the observer frame ) , but after igm absorption is taken into account the event is brighter at 4.44 @xmath23 m in the observer frame .    in the left panel of figure [ fig : nir ]",
    "we show nir light curves for all five pop iii sne at 4.44 @xmath23 m in _ jwst _ at @xmath22 30 , or 100 myr after the big bang .",
    "the detection limit for this filter is ab magnitude 32 , so all five explosions will be visible for over a thousand days .",
    "their light curves do not cross above the detection threshold until 50 days ( or 1.5 days in the source frame at this redshift ) , so the most luminous component of the explosion , shock breakout , can not be seen from earth .",
    "the x - rays and extreme uv in the pulse are all redshifted into the uv and absorbed by neutral hydrogen .",
    "the nir flux in the observer frame exhibits significantly more variability than the bolometric flux because of the expansion and cooling of the fireball , and this is essential to identifying these events as explosive transients .",
    "the flux rises much more quickly than it falls , so it is easiest to detect pop iii pi sne in their initial stages .",
    "nonetheless , they exhibit sufficient variability over likely protogalactic survey times of 15 yr to be identified at later times as well .",
    "this variation over timescales of @xmath121000 days will also allow them to be discriminated from primeval galaxies , in spite of their probable overlap in color - color space .",
    "although recent calculations show that roughly one pop iii pi sn will be present in any given _",
    "deep field @xcite , far greater numbers could be found in proposed all - sky nir surveys with _",
    "wfirst_. with a sensitivity of ab magnitude 27 at 2.2 @xmath23 m , _ wfirst _ will see such explosions at @xmath22 1520 , as we show in the right panel of figure [ fig : nir ] .",
    "such redshifts may be optimal for detecting pi sne because of the rise of uv background fields from the first generations of pop iii stars .",
    "this background is thought to delay primordial star formation in halos until they have grown to larger masses , forming more massive stars at slightly lower redshifts @xcite .",
    "star formation rates extracted from large - scale cosmological simulations of early structure formation that include uv backgrounds @xcite suggest that wfirst will detect up to 10@xmath24 pi sne per year at @xmath25 .",
    "detections of this volume will enable the first major surveys of the pop iii initial mass function ( imf ) ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for discussions on strategies for detecting superluminous type iin sne in all - sky surveys ) .",
    "our calculations definitively establish that _ jwst _ and _ wfirst _ will be able to detect pop iii supernovae at the era of first light .",
    "in addition to unveiling the nature of primordial stars and constraining scenarios for early cosmological reionization and chemical enrichment , detections of pop iii supernovae at slightly lower redshifts ( @xmath4 1015 ) will probe the era of primitive galaxy formation , revealing their positions on the sky when they might otherwise have eluded detection by _ jwst_.",
    "the discovery of the first cosmic explosions will be one of the most spectacular results in extragalactic astronomy in the coming decade , and open the first window on the end of the cosmic dark ages .",
