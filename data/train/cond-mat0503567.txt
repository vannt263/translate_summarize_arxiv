    "the transport properties of two dimensional ( 2d ) systems reveal the intriguing features .",
    "one of the feature is a metallic - like temperature dependence of the resistivity ( @xmath3 ) at low temperature in some kind of 2d systems , e.g. , in n - si mosfet and 2d hole gas in al@xmath0ga@xmath1as / gaas and ge@xmath1si@xmath0/ge structures ( see refs . and and references therein ) . as a rule",
    "such a behavior is observed in the structures with large value of the gas parameter @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the bohr radius and fermi quasimomentum , respectively , which characterizes the electron - electron ( _ e - e _ ) or hole - hole ( _ h - h _ ) interaction strength .    up to",
    "now there is not conventional opinion whether the metallic - like temperature dependence of the conductivity attests on quantum phase transition or it results from the interaction correction to the conductivity . for low @xmath7-values and within the diffusion regime ( @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the transport relaxation time and @xmath10 ) , the interaction correction is , as a rule , negative and increases in absolute value with the lowering temperature .",
    "however , for the intermediate ( @xmath11 ) and ballistic ( @xmath12 ) regimes this correction can change sign leading to the metallic behavior of the resistivity ( @xmath3).@xcite such effect crucially depends on the value of the fermi - liquid constant @xmath2 ( see figs .  7 and 8 in ref .  ) , therefore the experimental determination of the interaction correction to the conductivity and the value of @xmath2 is a central point of numerous papers during the last few years .     determined experimentally for p - type structures al@xmath0ga@xmath1as and ge@xmath1si@xmath0/ge : ( @xmath13 ) ref .  ; ( @xmath14 ) ref .  ; ( @xmath15 ) ref .  ; ( @xmath16 ) ref .  ; ( @xmath17 ) ref .  ; ( @xmath18 ) ref .  ; ( @xmath19 ) ref .  ; ( @xmath20 ) ref .  ; ( @xmath21 ) ref .  ; ( @xmath22 ) our data .",

    "the dashed line shows @xmath23 when the correction is equal to zero in the diffusion regime .",
    "the inset shows the diffusion _ h - h _ correction at tenfold changing of the temperature as a function of @xmath2 . ]",
    "unlike the case of structures with the electron 2d gas there are some difficulties in extraction of the interaction correction to the conductivity in p - type structures with complex valence band , especially , for the low hole density .",
    "first of all , the large value of perpendicular @xmath24-factor ( which responsible for the zeeman splitting in magnetic field perpendicular to the structure plane ) leads to an additional temperature dependence and appearance of magnetic field dependence of the interaction correction @xmath25 even in the diffusion regime .",
    "besides , for the high mobility 2d hole gas , the parameter @xmath26 is usually greater than unity for all available temperatures , the ballistic contribution is important and , therefore , the interaction correction contributes not only to @xmath27 , but to @xmath28 as well .",
    "strong anisotropy of @xmath24-factor ( we mean the strongly different zeeman splitting in in - plane and perpendicular magnetic field ) makes it difficult to determine the reliable value of @xmath2 from in - plane magnetoresistance experiments .",
    "most likely just these facts lead to a very large scatter in the @xmath2-values determined for the 2d hole gas in different papers as illustrated by fig .",
    "moreover the the value of @xmath2 determined from the different effects in the same structures , namely , from the temperature dependence of the conductivity at @xmath29 and from the temperature dependence of @xmath30 , occurs significantly different.@xcite    for the first sight , it may appear that the scatter in @xmath2 is not so large .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that the @xmath2-sensitivity of the _ h - h _ interaction correction is very strong .",
    "so , a variation of @xmath2 within the scatter range leads to the strong variation in the value of interaction correction so that even the sign of the correction becomes different in the diffusion regime .",
    "this illustrates by the inset in fig .",
    "[ f0 ] , where the changing of this correction at tenfold temperature variation as a function of @xmath2 is plotted .    from our point of view for the reliable determination of @xmath2 and enucleation of the role of _ e - e _ ( _ h - h _ ) interaction in the forming of the metallic - like temperature dependence of the conductivity it is necessary to study it thoroughly starting from the conditions , under which the theories are attested , i.e. , at low enough @xmath7-value and in the circumstances , where the ballistic contribution is not dominant .    in the present paper",
    "we study the _ h - h _ interaction correction to the conductivity for the low - mobility , high - density [ @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33-type quantum well heterostructures with @xmath34 within the temperature range from @xmath35 to @xmath36  k , when the parameter @xmath26 lies within the interval from @xmath37 to @xmath38 that captures the diffusion region .",
    "let us begin with the diffusion regime , @xmath39 . for @xmath29 ,",

    "in most cases the value in the square brackets is positive and at @xmath39 the interaction correction is localizing and leads to the logarithmic decrease of the conductivity with the temperature decrease .",

    "( [ eq10a ] ) and ( [ eq10b ] ) remain to be valid in a classically strong magnetic field .",
    "the absence of the interaction contribution to @xmath28 leads to the parabolic magnetic field dependence of @xmath30 at @xmath44 : @xmath45 the following peculiarity of the interaction induced parabolic negative magnetoresistance is evident . despite the fact that the curvature of the parabola @xmath46 is temperature dependent",
    ", there is the point at @xmath47 , in which all the parabolas relating to different temperatures should cross each other .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) markedly deviates from eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) already at @xmath49 .    up to now we neglected the zeeman splitting . taking it into account results in the appearance of the magnetic field dependence of @xmath25 at @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",

    "note , namely the fact that the _ e - e _ ( _ h - h _ ) interaction in the diffusion regime contributes only to @xmath27 gives a possibility to extract reliably this contribution from the experimental data .",
    "let us now consider the more general case when both the diffusion and ballistic contributions are of importance . in the absence of magnetic field",

    "theory for the ballistic and intermediate regime , when the strong inequality @xmath8 is not fulfilled , is developed for classically low perpendicular magnetic field in ref .  .",
    "the ballistic regime for the high magnetic field was considered in two papers , refs .   and .",

    "it is clear that only in the case when all the mentioned above dependences are well described in the framework of a common model one can consider the result as conclusive and the value of the parameter @xmath2 , which determines the value of interaction correction , can be considered as found reliably .",
    "we have studied the interaction correction in the heterostructures gaas / in@xmath0ga@xmath1as / gaas grown by metal - organic vapor phase epitaxy on semi - insulator gaas substrate . the lattice mismatch between in@xmath0ga@xmath1as and gaas results in biaxial compression of the quantum well .",
    "two types of heterostructures were studied .",
    "the structures of the first type , 3855 and 3857 , consist of a @xmath74  nm - thick undoped gaas buffer layer , carbon @xmath75-layer , a 7  nm spacer of undoped gaas , a 10  nm in@xmath76ga@xmath77as well , a 7  nm spacer of undoped gaas , a carbon @xmath75-layer and 200  nm cap layer of undoped gaas . the structure of the second type , 3951 , was analogous , the only difference was the wider spacer , 15  nm , and as sequence the higher momentum relaxation time . the samples were mesa etched into standard hall bars and then an al gate electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation onto the cap layer through a mask .",
    "varying the gate voltage @xmath78 we were able to change the hole density and mobility ( transport relaxation time ) in the quantum well ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "for the quantitative interpretation of the experimental results one needs to know the effective mass and @xmath24-factor . the hole effective mass in the structures investigated has been experimentally determined from the temperature dependence of the amplitude of the shubnikov - de haas oscillations .",
