    "the simplest and most intuitive definition of superfluidity ( sf ) is the ability to move without dissipation . according to a perturbative mechanism proposed by landau",
    ", superfluidity is broken when the velocity of the flow exceeds a critical value @xmath0 at which it is energetically favorable to emit elementary excitations .",
    "though this mechanism has been explicitly verified in @xmath1he @xcite , @xmath2he - b @xcite and bose einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite , many experiments in @xmath1he @xcite , @xmath2he - a @xcite and becs @xcite have shown that the actual critical velocity @xmath3 is generally lower than @xmath4 due to the occurrence of phase slips . in this scenario , sf is protected by an energy barrier which may be overcome by fluctuations of thermal ( as first suggested by iordanskii in the context of liquid he - ii @xcite and by little for superconductors @xcite ) or quantal origin ( as more recently observed in @xmath1he @xcite , in superconducting nano - wires @xcite and possibly also in becs @xcite ) , leading to what is called a resistive state in the physics of superconductors .    in what follows",
    "we address the problem of determining the critical velocity for the breakdown of sf of a matter wave moving in a disordered potential .",
    "the matter wave beam is formed by a guided bec in a quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) geometry .",
    "we assume zero temperature ; it is well known that in this case superconductivity and superfluidity are not destroyed by weak disorder .",
    "this is anderson s theorem for non - magnetic impurities in superconductors @xcite ; similar results ( with a different physical mechanism ) hold for becs @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the phase coherence of the system is preserved in 1d in the presence of a weak disorder as demonstrated in the experiments reported in refs .",
    "@xcite . as a consequence",
    ", one may study a simple scenario for breakdown of superfluidity in disordered becs where phase slips are neither thermally nor quantum mechanically nucleated but rather have a dynamical origin : the barrier disappears at a given critical velocity .",
    "this mechanism is standard in the absence of disorder ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) and the extraordinary control achieved in the domain of atomic vapor has even allowed a direct observation of the nonlinear excitations nucleated above the critical velocity @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge there is up to now only one clear experimental evidence of dynamical breakdown of sf and of finite critical velocity in the presence of disorder , obtained by studying the damping of dipole oscillations in an elongated bec @xcite . in our fully 1d case , as well as in the dipole oscillation experiments",
    "@xcite , an important issue is to understand the out - of equilibrium solutions of a nonlinear continuous system in the presence of disorder . in this context , the phase diagram of the fluid flowing through a quasi 1d disordered potential @xmath5 of finite extent @xmath6 was recently studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . here , we concentrate on the sf part of this diagram and more specifically on the description of the breakdown of sf when the velocity ( or the length @xmath6 of the disordered region ) increases .",
    "we study two different types of disordered potential with opposite characteristics .",
    "the first one is a smooth potential whose typical spatial scale of variation is large compared to the healing length of the condensate . in this case",
    "a local density approximation holds and a local landau criterion can be applied @xcite .",
    "this mechanism reconciles the landau approach with the phase slip phenomenon , because it predicts that sf is broken when the local landau velocity is reached by emission of nonlinear excitations ( solitons in our 1d case ) .",
    "the second type of disordered potential consists in a series of point - like impurities and thus has , contrarily to the previous type , strong fluctuations on small spatial scales .",
    "we show that in this case the criterion can be adapted yielding  as in the previous case  very good agreement with numerical simulations . in both cases",
    "we explicitly compute the statistical properties of the critical velocity @xmath3 and show that they are closely related to the extreme value statistics of the disordered potential .",
    "we finally discuss experimental realizations of our models .",
    "the system considered is a weakly interacting bec transversely confined by a harmonic potential of frequency @xmath7 . for simplicity",
    ", the disordered potential @xmath8 is supposed to depend on a single spatial variable  the coordinate @xmath9 along the axial direction of the guide .",
    "a stationary flow of the system is then accurately described by a 1d order parameter @xmath10 obeying the nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite @xmath11\\psi \\ ; .\\ ] ] here , @xmath12 is the condensate density per unit of longitudinal length , @xmath13 is the chemical potential and @xmath14 is the nonlinear parameter ( @xmath15 is the @xmath16d s - wave scattering length ) . in the low density regime ( @xmath17 )",
    "the density profile in the transverse direction is gaussian - shaped and @xmath18 , whereas @xmath19 in the opposite high density regime ( @xmath20 ) where the thomas - fermi approximation holds for the transverse degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "in addition to the density @xmath21 , it is convenient to characterize the flow by its velocity @xmath22_x$ ] .",
    "we assume that the disordered potential @xmath5 takes sizable values only over a region of finite length @xmath6 . in this case",
    "a sf flow corresponds to a solution of eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) with constant density @xmath23 and velocity @xmath24 at @xmath25 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath13 then reads : @xmath26 in the following we denote the chemical potential of a bec at rest as @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) .    in absence of external potential",
    ", the sf solution corresponds to @xmath29 and @xmath30 for all @xmath9 , and one can show that it is stable under a weak perturbing potential provided @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the sound velocity of the unperturbed condensate .",
    "the condition @xmath31 is exactly the landau criterion for sf because in a bec the velocity @xmath4 is precisely the speed of sound .",
    "in the case of a slowly varying potential , that is , when the typical length of spatial variations of @xmath5 is much larger than the healing length @xmath33 of the fluid , one can devise a local density approximation for describing stationary flows . in this scheme , the flow verifies current conservation and local equilibrium .",
    "this reads @xmath34 and @xmath35 from these considerations it is easy to see that the velocity @xmath36 is determined by a simple algebraic equation @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "this equation admits a solution provided @xmath39 is lower than the maximum of @xmath40 .",
    "if this condition is violated the flow no longer admits a stationary solution , sf is broken and the flow becomes dissipative ( one can show that in this case the obstacle described by the potential @xmath5 experiences a finite drag @xcite ) .",
    "the maximum of @xmath40 is reached when @xmath41^{2+\\nu}$ ] , which precisely reads @xmath42 where @xmath43 can be termed the local sound velocity [ compare with ( [ sound ] ) ]  : sf is broken when one reaches the local landau criterion .    in this approximation",
    ", it is clear that sf will first break down at the point @xmath44 where the potential is maximum : @xmath45=u_{\\rm m}$ ] .",
    "the condition @xmath46 yields an explicit relation between @xmath47 and @xmath3 : @xmath48    everything now boils down to a problem of extreme value : once the statistical properties of the maximum @xmath47 of @xmath5 over @xmath49 $ ] are known , the distribution of the critical velocities @xmath3 can be obtained readily through ( [ vc0 ] ) .",
    "namely , if one denotes by @xmath50 the probability distribution of @xmath47 and by @xmath51 the corresponding distribution of the critical velocity @xmath3 one has @xmath52   \\ , { \\mathscr p}_{\\sss\\!\\ !   l}(u_{\\rm m } ) \\ ; .    \\label{dist_vc0}\\ ] ] the distribution function of @xmath47 ( and thus also that of @xmath3 ) depends on the size @xmath6 of the disordered region for the simple reason that the longer the disordered region , the larger the probability of finding a large maximum of @xmath8 .",
    "hence it is clear that , on average , the critical velocity decreases with increasing sample length @xmath6 .",
    "note also that , in this picture , the critical velocity is related to the local fluctuations of the disorder and not to the details of the correlations .    in order to calculate the distribution of @xmath47 ,",
    "the first step consists in mapping the problem of finding the maximum value of a correlated continuous function to a problem of a set of @xmath53 discrete uncorrelated variables .",
    "according to @xcite this mapping can be done if the correlation function of @xmath5 , characterized by a correlation length @xmath54 , decays faster than a logarithm and provided @xmath55 . from now on we assume that these requirements are fulfilled , and study the extreme value statistics of a set of @xmath56 uncorrelated random variables @xmath57 distributed according to the probability distribution of the disorder potential @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 is a parameter of order unity that depends on the correlation function and has to be determined numerically @xcite .",
    "if we denote by @xmath60 and @xmath61 the cumulative distribution functions of @xmath8 and @xmath47 , respectively , we have @xmath62^n$ ] . taking the derivative of this expression yields the probability distribution @xmath63 and then the distribution of the critical velocity through ( [ vc0 ] ) and ( [ dist_vc0 ] ) .",
    "to estimate the frontier between the superfluid and the dissipative regimes , we calculate the median @xmath64 of this distribution and obtain @xmath65 where @xmath66 is given by ( [ vc0 ] ) .     through a gaussian correlated disordered potential of extension @xmath6 ( the parameters @xmath67 , @xmath54 and @xmath68 take here the values @xmath18 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) .",
    "dark region : time dependent flow ; light gray ( light blue online ) region : sf stationary flow .",
    "the ( yellow online ) solid line displays the boundary between the two regions as predicted by eq .",
    "( [ bound ] ) .",
    "the inset displays the cumulative probability distribution of the critical velocity @xmath3 for samples of two different lengths .",
    "staircase functions : numerical computations ; dot - dashed lines : theory .",
    "]    in order to check the validity of our approach , we have numerically determined the critical velocity from time dependent simulations of the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "starting from the ground state in the presence of disorder at zero velocity , we have adiabatically accelerated the disordered potential until it reaches a velocity @xmath24 . for each @xmath24 and @xmath6",
    "we consider 80 realizations of the random potential and determine the fraction @xmath71 of stationary solutions .",
    "this quantity is plotted in fig .",
    "[ diag_gauss ] using a gray scale [ dark , @xmath72 ; light blue ( gray ) , @xmath73 as a function of the normalized variables @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the inset displays @xmath76 , the cumulative probability distribution of the critical velocity .",
    "very good agreement is observed in the expected limit of validity of our approach ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "figure [ diag_gauss ] is drawn in the case of a gaussian disorder , @xmath77 , with a gaussian correlation function ( numerically we find @xmath78 ) .",
    "we have also checked the accuracy of our predictions for other types of disorder of experimental interest ( lorentz - correlated disorder and speckle potential ) .",
    "another commonly used model of disorder is a potential formed by a series of @xmath79-like impurities : @xmath80 , where the @xmath81 s are uncorrelated random variables distributed between @xmath82 and @xmath6 with density @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath84 is the dimensionless strength of a scatterer . in the presence of such a potential ,",
    "the local landau criterion is no longer applicable because the density is not smooth .",
    "however one can devise an approach adapted to this particular case .",
    "one first remarks that each impurity repels the condensate , the density of which reaches its lowest local value at the position of the @xmath79 peak .",
    "the region in space where the decrease in density is the largest will correspond to configurations where two ( or more ) scatterers lie very close to each other .",
    "sf will break down , therefore , at the point where the local concentration of @xmath79 peaks is maximum .",
    "the smallest length scale for density modulations of the condensate is the healing length @xmath85 .",
    "the condensate is therefore not sensitive to details of the disordered potential on scales smaller than @xmath85 .",
    "one thus divides the disordered region into @xmath86 boxes , each of size @xmath85 , and replaces the @xmath87 delta peaks present in box @xmath88 by a single effective peak of strength @xmath89 .",
    "the goal is then to determine the probability distribution of intensity of the strongest of the effective peaks , because it is at this peak that sf will first be broken .",
    "one thus needs to calculate the probability distribution of @xmath90 , where @xmath91 .",
    "the probability of finding @xmath92 peaks in an interval of length @xmath85 is @xmath93 , where @xmath94 . in the limit of a wide disordered region ( @xmath95 ) ,",
    "the product @xmath96 remaining constant , the binomial law can be approximated by a poisson law of parameter @xmath97 : @xmath98  . in this limit",
    "the @xmath99 s are uncorrelated and the cumulative distribution of @xmath100 is @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the cumulative distribution function associated with the poisson law [ @xmath103 is the incomplete gamma function ] .",
    "one can relate the sf critical velocity to the strength @xmath104 of the strongest effective peak by using the criterion for the critical velocity obtained in @xcite for a single peak : @xmath105 , where @xmath106 the probability distribution of @xmath3 is then @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "but for a random potential formed by a sequence of uncorrelated delta peaks ( @xmath109 , @xmath110 ) . ]    defining again the typical critical velocity as the median , the boundary of the sf region corresponds to @xmath111 figure [ diag_delta1 ] displays the stability phase diagram and the cumulative distribution of the critical velocity . here",
    "also we find excellent agreement with the numerical results .",
    "there are several experimental possibilities for studying the statistical properties of the boundary of the sf region .",
    "the gaussian disorder with zero average may be implemented experimentally in the case of micro - fabricated circuits , where the atoms are magnetically guided over a chip @xcite .",
    "roughness and disorder in the circuits induce fluctuations along the guide which are typically lorentzian correlated , with a correlation length @xmath54 which decreases with increasing distance between the guide and the chip @xcite . however , the most common type of experimental disorder is the so called speckle potential , generated by a laser beam passing through a diffusing plate @xcite .",
    "one of the most appropriate set ups seems to be the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the critical velocity of a trapped bose - einstein condensate has been probed by sweeping a laser beam through it .",
    "the critical velocity was determined from measurements of the amount of excitations related to the emission of solitons and linear excitations .",
    "similar studies could be done by sweeping the laser beam through a diffusive plate at constant velocity , thus creating a moving speckle potential .",
    "finally , the statistical properties of the sf breaking may also be studied by simply adapting our calculations to the damping of dipole oscillations , along the lines of the recent experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in conclusion",
    "we have stressed the link between the sf critical velocity in presence of disorder and the statistics of extreme events . we have developed simple models in two opposite situations where the disorder is either very smooth or composed of point - like impurities . in both cases",
    "the agreement between numerical simulations and our analytical model is very good .",
    "we note that , because of the mapping of the statistical properties of the critical velocities to that of extreme events of an uncorrelated sequence , in the limit @xmath95 the distribution of @xmath3 tends to one of the universal distributions of extreme value statistics @xcite . a possible extension of this work could be the application to fermionic superfluids in the bcs regime . in that case",
    ", the landau critical velocity is related to the pairing gap , and an equation similar to ( [ vc0 ] ) can be explicitly written down @xcite .",
