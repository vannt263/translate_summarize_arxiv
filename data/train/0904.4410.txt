    "the nature of the connection between starbursts and agn has been long debated . while the effectiveness of agn feedback in quenching star formation has been heralded as a key component of galaxy formation by semi - analytic models ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", it is only very recently that observational evidence of agn activity co - incident with post - starburst signatures has been found @xcite .",
    "however these discoveries form far from a consensus , with some suggestions that agn feedback alone may not be sufficient for the truncation of star formation in these galaxies @xcite .",
    "the mid - ir contains unique diagnostics of the star formation , agn activity , and dust obscuration levels of galaxies .",
    "rest - frame @xmath1 m observations can decipher the relative strength of these attributes via investigation of the pah emission properties , continuum slope , and silicate absorption strength , respectively .",
    "here we utilise _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ) observations of a sample of galaxies which appear at different stages of post - starburst evolution as determined by their optical spectra .",
    "in particular we use the h@xmath2 , [ oii]3272 and 4000@xmath3 break spectral features to identify k+a galaxies at 3 different epochs .",
    "k+a galaxies are typically identified via their optical spectrum , with strong absorption in the balmer series lines , but no significant emission in the [ oii]3727  line or other emission lines associated with star formation ( dressler & gunn 1983 ; couch and sharples 1987 ; among others ) .",
    "this kind of optical spectrum is indicative of a galaxy which has undergone a very recent burst of star formation as the young , short - lived ( @xmath4 gyr ) a and b stars are still observed , but no ongoing , or very low level , star formation .",
    "spectral modelling of k+a galaxies typically suggests a star - burst in which 1 - 10% of the galactic stellar mass is in the form of new stars ( i.e. balogh et al 1999 ) .",
    "we selected 12 galaxies in three categories from the overlap between the _ spitzer _ swire survey and the sdss spectroscopic dataset for observations with irs .",
    "the targets were selected via their [ oii]3727 , h@xmath2 ( 4101 ) , and d4000 indices to be at distinct post - starburst stages .",
    "the h@xmath2 and d4000 indices are well established as good indicators of stellar age ( i.e. @xcite ) , while the [ oii]3727 is a well known indicator of current star formation . measurements of the indices were performed as per roseboom et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . to determine our selection criteria we turn to the stellar population synthesis models of @xcite .",
    "models which assume an exponentially declining starburst ( @xmath5 myr ) on top of a passively evolving single stellar population of 11 gyr were generated using the @xcite code .",
    "burst strengths of 1,5 & 10@xmath6 were considered . from these models",
    "we determine 3 sets of h@xmath2 & d4000 criteria which isolate galaxies with roughly 0.03 , 0.3 and 1 gyr of post - starburst evolution . in the case of the later two selections an additional [ oii ] selection cut",
    "is imposed to filter out galaxies with significant ongoing star formation .",
    "the specifics of this selection are ; +    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      + @xmath7 in emission    observations were performed with the short - low module in staring mode , two nod positions per spectral order with an offset of 20  were observed with ramp times between 400 - 600s .",
    "the data were reduced using a combination of the smart ( hidgon et al .",
    "2004 ) and spice software environments .",
    "first individual ramps of the same order and nod were combined in smart utilising a median filtering algorithm .",
    "sky subtraction is performed via subtraction of different order observations at the same nod position . once combined and corrected for background / sky contributions",
    "the spectra are extracted using the spice pipeline assuming these objects are point sources for _ spitzer _ at these wavelengths .",
    "finally the two nods are combined in smart to produce the final spectrum .",
    "11 of the 12 irs spectra are found to have acceptable s / n spectra ( @xmath8 ) however one of the irs observations appears to have featureless , flat spectrum , suggesting that the exposure times were not sufficient to detect the mid - ir features , or the irs slit was misplaced in relation to the mid - ir emission .",
    "this failed observations is omitted in the following discussion .",
    "figure [ fig : irs_spec ] shows the irs spectra for the 11 sources discussed here . for comparison the starburst template of brandl et al .",
    "( 2006 ) is also shown .",
    "all the spectra , with the exception of oka 1 , show clear pah emission features at 6.2 , 7.7 and 11.3@xmath0 m .",
    "oka 1 is found to have a completely stellar dominated thermal spectrum , similar to early - type galaxies observed with irs ( e.g. ngc 4552 ; smith et al .",
    "negligible silicate 9.7@xmath0 m absorption is seen in all cases .",
    "overall the spectra are typical of normal starburst galaxies ( i.e. @xcite ) .",
    "however one unusual feature of these spectra is the dominance of the 11.3@xmath0 m pah feature over the 6.2@xmath0 m pah feature in the k+a and old k+a types . to emphasis this point in figure",

    "equivalent widths ( ews ) and fluxes for the pah features in the irs spectra are measured via use of the idl pahfit tool@xcite . as the mid - ir coverage",
    "is limited to 5 - 12@xmath0 m the determination of the continuum around 7 - 12@xmath0 m is troublesome due to the degeneracy between silicate absorption and pah emission .",
    "however as our spectra appear to have no signs of strong silicate absorption around 9.7@xmath0 m we constrain the silicate absorption be be zero by running pahfit with the /no_extinction flag set .",
    "table [ tab : optprop ] lists the optical properties , while table [ tab : irprop ] lists the mid - ir line fluxes and equivalent widths .    to identify correlations between these observed properties and the post - starburst evolution we try to fit a two component stellar population model to each galaxies spectrum .",

    "we find the best fit log - linear relationship between the variables . as the errors in both burst time and the flux ratios are significant simple linear regression techniques are not sufficient ; hence best fit parameters and their error are determined via a monte carlo simulation of the dataset . in each realisation the data points are `` scattered '' by the quoted error multiplied by a normally distributed random number .",
    "the analysis here utilises 10,000 realisations .",

    "smith et al .",
    "( 2007 ) hypothesise that variations in pah ratios could be generated via either weaker radiation fields , resulting in more neutral pahs , or preferential destruction of the smallest grains in the presence of a very hard radiation field .",
    "they find that the 10 objects in their sample with the highest s@xmath81/s@xmath80 pah ratios have clear evidence for liner or seyfert agn activity at longer wavelengths , suggesting that hard radiation fields associated with agn could be preferentially destroying the smaller grains responsible for the 6.2@xmath0 m and 7.7@xmath0 m bands , leaving an excess of the larger 11.3@xmath0 m emitting grains .    here",
    "we also find that all of the galaxies which have high s@xmath81/s@xmath93 m pah ratios have evidence of agn activity in their optical spectra .",
    "interestingly we do not find that the s@xmath81/s@xmath80 pah ratio varies with time since starburst in the same way as the s@xmath81/s@xmath79 ratio .",
    "however this is further complicated by the observed evolution in the s@xmath81/s@xmath82 ratio , which is what would be expected from grain destruction , but should not be possible without an accompanying s@xmath81/s@xmath80 ratio change .",
    "even more challenging is the odd behaviour of the s@xmath82/s@xmath79 ratio , which shows no evolution despite the s@xmath80/s@xmath79 showing a clear change with time since starburst .",
    "we put these irregularities down to underestimates in the error in the 8.6@xmath0 m line flux , which is heavily blended with the larger 7.7@xmath0 m feature and is thus badly effected by the poor estimates of the continuum ; a serious possibility given that we only have 512@xmath0 m spectroscopy for these objects .",
    "however agn are only one possible explanation for this behaviour of the pah band ratios .",
    "detailed modelling of the pah emission models by @xcite has shown that increasing the hardness of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) will result in a sharp decrease in both the s@xmath81/s@xmath80 ratio and the s@xmath80/s@xmath79 ratio while destroying the smallest grains ( @xmath94 ) will have the inverse affect .",
    "in addition increasing the ionization level of the pah emitting grains will decrease the s@xmath81/s@xmath80 ratio while leaving the s@xmath80/s@xmath79 ratio unaffected .",
    "thus the results found here can be explained via the following ;    1 .   the ionization level is higher than normal in these objects , decreasing the s@xmath81/s@xmath80 ratio 2 .",
    "however the ionization level is so high that the smallest grains are being destroyed , increasing both the s@xmath81/s@xmath95 & s@xmath80/s@xmath79 ( and thus the s@xmath81/s@xmath96 as well ) .",
    "thus the s@xmath81/s@xmath95 ratio may be balanced out by the competing processes and appear to have `` normal '' values , while the s@xmath81/s@xmath79 & s@xmath80/s@xmath96 ratios show abnormal increases . while any source which can strongly ionize and destroy the pah emitting grains could be invoked to explain this phenomena , given the evidence of low - level agn activity in the optical spectra for these sources we conclude that this is the most likely cause for these unusual pah line ratios .",
    "however this is purely speculative and other ionization sources such as significant populations of evolved stars may be capable of the levels of grain destruction and ionization seen here .",
    "the behaviour of the 8.6@xmath0 m line ratios does not fit into this model , as we should see similar behaviour from the s@xmath82/s@xmath79 ratio as the s@xmath80/s@xmath79 , which we do not .",
    "we have performed _ spitzer _ irs spectroscopy of 10 post starburst ( k+a ) galaxies at three distinct evolutionary stages . in each case",
    "the mid - ir spectra shows the signs of star forming galaxy with no obvious agn activity .",
    "interestingly we find that relative strength of the 11.3@xmath0 m to 6.2@xmath0 m , 11.3@xmath0 m to 8.6@xmath0 m and 7.7@xmath0 m to 6.2@xmath0 m pah features show some correlation with the time since last starburst , while the 11.3@xmath0 m to 7.7@xmath0 m and s@xmath82/s@xmath79 pah ratios do not .",
