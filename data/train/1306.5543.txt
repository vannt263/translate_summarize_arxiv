    "the coherent interaction of laser radiation with multi - level atoms can induce interesting phenomena such as electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) and electromagnetically induced absorption ( eia ) .",
    "eit is a technique for turning an opaque medium into a transparent one and eia is a technique for enhancement of absorption of light around resonance .",
    "these techniques have been used widely to manipulate the group velocity of light@xcite , for storage of quantum information @xcite , and for enhancement of nonlinear processes@xcite .",
    "theoretical studies and technological advances in nanofabrication , laser cooling and trapping @xcite have made it possible to reach a considerable control over the light - matter interaction in an optomechanical system .",
    "optomechanically induced transparency ( omit ) and absorption ( omia ) are notable examples of light beam control in optomechanical systems . in omit which has been predicted theoretically@xcite and demonstrated experimentally@xcite , the anti - stokes scattering of an intense red - detuned optical `` control '' field brings about a modification in the optical response of the optomechanical cavity making it transparent in a narrow bandwidth around the cavity resonance for a probe beam . in analogy to the atomic eit , the happening of omit is accompanied by a sharp negative derivative of the dispersion profile of the cavity near the resonance and subluminal group velocity for the probe field @xcite . in the atomic eit",
    "the possibility of modification of the probe laser absorption , splitting and reshaping of the eit peak and reduction of the eit linewidth have been studied widely@xcite .    in this work",
    "we are interested in the engineering and control of the probe response , specially omit resonance , in the presence of an additional mechanical mode and the kerr - down conversion nonlinearity . to this end , we consider a cavity with two moving mirrors , driven by a strong coupling and a weak probe field which contains a nonlinear crystal consisting of a kerr medium and a degenerate optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) .",
    "this exploration is motivated by the following reasons .",
    "first , in a recent theoretical work @xcite it has been shown that the coherent coupling between the two cavity modes and the mechanical mode of a moving mirror in a double cavity configuration of optomechanical system leads to the appearance of an absorption peak within the transparency window . in this configuration by changing the power of the electromagnetic field the switching between eit and eia is possible .",
    "this model is quite general and a variety of systems , which can be modeled by three coupled oscillators , can make the same response .",
    "a driven fabry - perot cavity with two vibrating mirrors can be effectively described by three coupled oscillators whenever a slightly difference in the mechanical frequencies leads to the center - of - mass - relative - motion coupling @xcite . in this configuration the two mechanical oscillators",
    "are coupled to a single cavity mode .",
    "second , an opa inside a cavity can considerably improve the optomechanical coupling , the normal mode splitting ( nms ) , and the cooling of the mechanical mirror@xcite .",
    "this kind of cooling process which is accompanied by the enhancement of the effective damping rate of the mirror can be used to increase the width of the transparency window and reduce the group velocity of a propagating probe pulse .",
    "third , it has been predicted@xcite that by tuning the kerr nonlinearity in an optomechanical cavity one can use the cavity energy shift to reduce the photon number fluctuation and provide a coherently - controlled dynamics for the mirror .    based on these reasons ,",
    "we first investigate the effect of the additional mechanical oscillator on the omit resonance",
    ". we will show that if the coupling field oscillates close to the mechanical resonance frequencies there are two occasions of two - photon resonance for the probe and coupling lasers .",
    "consequently , the coherent oscillations of the two mechanical oscillators give rise to splitting of the omit resonance , and appearance of an absorption peak within the transparency window .",
    "the coherent induced splitting of omit resonance in this configuration is similar to driving a hyperfine transition in an atomic @xmath0-type three - level system by a radio - frequency or microwave field .",
    "then we explore how eit and eia resonances respond to the presence of a kerr - down conversion nonlinearity in the cavity .",
    "we will show that in the presence of kerr - down conversion nonlinearity one can effectively control the width of the transparency window . also , we demonstrate that to achieve a desirable control over the omit resonance the presence of both nonlinearities is needed .",
    "in addition , for the three - mode nonlinear optomechanical system we show that the coherent oscillation of the center - of - mass mode which is responsible for the absorption peak and splitting in the transparency window , increases .",
    "this results in the increment of the central peak absorption .",
    "briefly , the combination of an additional mechanical mode and the nonlinear crystal suggests new possibilities for `` engineering '' the omit resonance .",
    "the model we consider is an optomechanical cavity with two vibrating mirrors which contains a kerr - down conversion nonlinear crystal ( fig.[fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the vibrating mirrors are treated as two independent quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator with resonance frequency @xmath1 , effective mass @xmath2 , and energy decay rate @xmath3 @xmath4 , coupled to a common cavity mode having the resonance frequency @xmath5 .",
    "the nonlinear crystal is composed of a degenerate opa and a nonlinear kerr medium .",
    "the cavity mode is coherently driven by a strong input coupling laser field with frequency @xmath6 and amplitude @xmath7 as well as a weak probe field with frequency @xmath8 and amplitude @xmath9 through the left mirror .",
    "furthermore , the system is pumped by a coupling beam to produce parametric oscillation and induce the kerr nonlinearity in the cavity . when the detection bandwidth is chosen such that it includes only a single , isolated , mechanical resonance and mode - mode coupling is negligible we can restrict to a single mechanical mode for each mirror so that the mechanical hamiltonian of the mirrors is given by @xmath10 furthermore , in the adiabatic limit , in which the mirror frequencies are much smaller than the cavity free spectral range @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath13 is the cavity length in the absence of the intracavity field ) the photon scattering into the other modes can be neglected and we can restrict the model to the case of single - cavity mode@xcite .",
    "we also assume that the induced resonance frequency shift of the cavity and the nonlinear parameter of the kerr medium are much smaller than the longitudinal - mode spacing in the cavity .",
    "it should be noted that in the adiabatic limit , the number of photons generated by the casimir , retardation , and doppler effects is negligible @xcite .        under this condition , the total hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xmath14 where    [ hamil ] @xmath15    the first term in @xmath16 is the free hamiltonian of the cavity field with the annihilation ( creation ) operator @xmath17 , frequency @xmath18 and decay rate @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the free hamiltonian of the mirrors given by eq.([hm ] ) , the third term describes the optomechanical coupling between the cavity field and the mechanical oscillators due to the radiation pressure force , and the last term in @xmath16 describes the driving of the intracavity mode with the input laser amplitude @xmath21 .",
    "also , the two terms in @xmath22 describe , respectively , the coupling of the intracavity field with the opa and the kerr medium ; @xmath23 is the nonlinear gain of the opa which is proportional to the pump power driving amplitude , @xmath24 is the phase of the field driving the opa , and @xmath25 is the anharmonicity parameter proportional to the third order nonlinear susceptibility @xmath26 of the kerr medium .",
    "we will solve this problem for the total driving field @xmath27 , where @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) are , respectively , the amplitude and power of the input coupling ( probe ) field .",
    "the dynamics of the system is described by a set of nonlinear langevin equations .",
    "since we are interested in the mean response of the system to the probe field we write the langevin equations for the mean values . in a frame rotating at the coupling laser frequency @xmath6 , neglecting quantum and thermal noises we obtain    [ langevin ] @xmath32",

    "it is obvious that the optical path and hence the cavity detuning are modified in an intensity - dependent way . since the effective detuning @xmath40 satisfies a fifth - order equation , it can have five real solutions and hence the system may exhibit multistability for a certain range of parameters . in our work",
    "we choose the parameters such that only one solution exists and the system has no bistability .",
    "now we consider the perturbation made by the probe field .",
    "the quantum langevin equations for the fluctuations are given by    [ langevin ] @xmath41    where @xmath42 .",
    "it is evident that the cavity mode is coupled only to the relative motion of the two mirrors , and it is therefore convenient to rewrite the above equations in terms of the fluctuations of the relative and center - of - mass coordinates : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the effective masses of the relative and center - of - mass modes , respectively .",
    "the linearized quantum langevin equations for the fluctuation operators of these coordinates take the forms    [ langevin2 ] @xmath46    where we have defined the relative motion frequency @xmath47 , damping rate @xmath48 and also the center - of - mass frequency @xmath49 and damping rate @xmath50 .",
    "the above equations show that even though the cavity mode interacts only with the relative motion mode , there is a coupling between the center - of - mass and relative motion modes when @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "we will show that the presence of this coupling makes the switching from eit to eia possible .",
    "now we use a fairly standard procedure for the investigation of the probe response . defining @xmath53",
    ", we use the following ansatz    [ ansatz ] @xmath54    in the original frame @xmath55 and @xmath56 oscillate at @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively . using the input - output relation@xcite , we obtain @xmath59 substituting eq.([ansatz ] ) into eq.([langevin2 ] ) we obtain the following equations    [ eqs ] @xmath60    where we have defined    [ lambda - define ] @xmath61    from the eq.([lambda - define]c ) we find that when @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 and thus the center - of - mass motion is fully decoupled from the cavity mode and the relative motion . while whenever @xmath65 the three modes are all coupled .",
    "the total output field @xmath66 , at the probe frequency is given by @xmath67 where    [ definf ] @xmath68    the real part ( @xmath69 ) and imaginary part ( @xmath70 ) of the field amplitude @xmath66 , respectively , show the absorptive and dispersive behavior of the output field at the probe frequency .",
    "these quantities can be measured by homodyne technique @xcite .",
    "the structure of the output field has some main characteristics , arising from the nonlinearity of the system and the freedom in choosing equal or unequal mechanical frequencies and damping rates . to understand the coupling - field - induced modification of the probe response and its structure we present the results and numerical calculations in the next section",
    "in this section , we first consider the bare cavity optomechanical system and investigate the condition in which the coherent coupling between the mechanical and optical modes leads to omit and omia .",
    "then we examine the effects of the kerr - down conversion nonlinearity on these phenomena .      to simplify our treatment for the bare cavity we can use the reasonable rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) to neglect the far off - resonance lower sideband ( @xmath71 ) in the resolved sideband regime ( @xmath72)@xcite . in the resolved sideband regime the normal mode splitting occurs @xcite . in this approximation @xmath66",
    "is simplified to the following form @xmath73 in what follows we investigate the two cases of equal and different mechanical frequencies separately .",
    "first , we consider the case in which the frequencies and damping rates of the two mechanical oscillators are the same , i.e. , @xmath74 and @xmath75 . as mentioned before , in this condition the radiation pressure",
    "is only coupled to the relative position of the two mirrors and the center - of - mass becomes an isolated quantum oscillator .",
    "therefore @xmath76 . when @xmath57 is close to the cavity frequency ( @xmath77 ) and the coupling field @xmath78 drives the cavity on its red sideband ( @xmath79 ) the structure of the resonance response of the output field @xmath66 is simplified to that of a cavity with one movable mirror and effective mass @xmath80 : @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 is the detuning from the line center .",
    "therefore the denominator of the response function is quadratic in @xmath84 .",
    "now we consider the case in which the frequency of the mechanical oscillators is different @xmath85 but their damping rates are equal @xmath75 .",
    "the new aspect of this condition is the coupling between the center - of - mass and the relative motion modes which results in the anomalous eia in the optomechanical cavity .",
    "when @xmath57 is close to the cavity frequency ( @xmath77 ) and the coupling field @xmath78 is red tuned by an amount @xmath86 the response of the system is simplified to the following form @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "therefore the denominator of the response function is cubic in @xmath84 .    to illustrate the numerical results we show the probe field absorption and dispersion profiles for the bare cavity in fig.[fig : re&im1 ] for the two cases of equal and different mechanical frequencies .",
    "we use the following set of experimentally realizable parameters @xcite : @xmath92 mw,@xmath93 nm,@xmath94hz , @xmath95 ng , @xmath96 , @xmath97 hz , and @xmath98 mm .",

    "<S> we consider an optomechanical cavity made by two moving mirrors which contains a kerr - down conversion nonlinear crystal . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the coherent oscillations of the two mechanical oscillators can lead to splitting in the electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) resonance , and appearance of an absorption peak within the transparency window . in this configuration </S>",
    "<S> the coherent induced splitting of eit is similar to driving a hyperfine transition in an atomic lambda - type three - level system by a radio - frequency or microwave field . also , we show that the presence of nonlinearity provides an additional flexibility for adjusting the width of the transparency windows . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of an additional mechanical mode and the nonlinear crystal suggests new possibilities for adjusting the resonance frequency , the width and the spectral positions of the eit windows as well as the enhancement of the absorption peak within the transparency window . </S>"
