    "recently , glendenning @xcite has shown that a proper construction of the nucleon - quark phase transition inside neutron stars implies the coexistence of nucleon matter and quark matter over a finite range of pressure .",
    "this has the effect that a core , or a spherical shell , of a mixed quark - nucleon phase can exist inside neutron stars .",

    "the nuclear symmetry energy in the rmf model increases monotonically with the baryon number density @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to several variational many - body ( vmb ) calculations of the equation of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter @xcite , which predict the symmetry energy to saturate and then to decrease at high densities .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study how sensitive the formation of a mixed quark - nucleon phase in neutron stars is to the high density behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy .",

    "we show here that it is the behavior of nucleon matter isobars that allows the existence of the mixed phase , irrespective of the particular form of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "one should stress that different nuclear matter models , which fit the saturation point , display a rather diverse high density behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy . as mentioned already ,",
    "variational calculations with phenomenological nucleon - nucleon potentials predict a density dependence that is incompatible with that of the rmf models .",

    "as one sees in figs .",
    "[ fig15 ] and [ fig16 ] , for higher values of the surface tension the characteristic sizes of structures    are larger than screening lengths in nucleon and quark matter so that the assumption of uniform charge distribution may not be valid .",
    "we have studied the formation of a mixed quark - nucleon phase in neutron stars , for different models of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "we conclude that the behavior of nucleon matter isobars in the @xmath67 plane , as , e.g. , in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , is fully responsible for the existence of the mixed phase .",
    "the isobars , for any pressure , have a common end point , corresponding to @xmath150 , which is thus independent of the nuclear symmetry energy . for @xmath151",
    "the isobars corresponding to various forms of the nuclear symmetry energy differ considerably .",
    "the most different is the location of the @xmath81 end point of isobars ( see figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the lower critical pressure @xmath27 for the first quark droplets to form is determined by the location of the @xmath81 end point of a nucleon isobar , which strongly depends on the form of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "the upper critical pressure @xmath29 for the last nucleons to dissolve into quarks is the same for all isobars that differ only in the form of the function @xmath36 determining the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "this explains why nucleon matter coexisting with quark matter becomes proton rich with increasing pressure , and disappearing nucleon matter at the critical pressure @xmath29 is symmetric . in ref .",
    "@xcite the increase of the proton fraction of nucleon matter coexisting in the mixed phase was attributed to the particular form of the nuclear symmetry energy in the rmf model .",
    "properties of neutron stars depend on both lower and upper critical pressure values , @xmath27 and @xmath29 . since the lower critical pressure @xmath27 strongly depends on the nuclear symmetry energy , properties of neutron stars",
    "also depend on it .",
    "in particular , the size of the mixed phase core , which determines the maximum mass of a neutron star , is rather sensitive to the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "conclusions concerning the presence of the mixed quark - nucleon phase in neutron stars are thus subject to some uncertainty that reflects incompatible high density predictions of the nuclear symmetry energy .    when the coulomb interaction and the surface tension are included in the calculations",
    ", one can determine the surface tension values for which the mixed quark - nucleon phase is the ground state of neutron star matter .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] the allowed range of @xmath152 is very narrow for the vmb model ( @xmath153 mev/@xmath147 ) , whereas it is much wider for the rmf model ( @xmath154 mev/@xmath147 ) .",
    "this research was partially supported by the polish state committee for scientific research ( kbn ) , under grant no . 2 p03b 112 17 .",
