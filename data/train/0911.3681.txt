    "broken symmetry and self - consistency are among the most fundamental concepts in modern theoretical physics .",
    "the former brings a drastic change in the system with the appearances of the order parameter @xcite and the corresponding nambu - goldstone boson .",
    "@xcite the order parameter has to be determined self - consistently together with quasiparticles responsible for the excitation .",
    "thus , the latter concept is also essential for describing broken symmetry phases .",
    "self - consistency plays crucial roles even in normal systems as exemplified in the landau theory of fermi liquids @xcite where an external perturbation produces a self - consistent molecular field to yield an enhanced response in some cases .",
    "it is also adopted commonly in various practical approximation schemes such as the hartree - fock theory and the density - functional theory ; @xcite with some infinite series incorporated in terms of the latter , self - consistent approximations can be far more effective than the simple perturbation expansion .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the landau theory of fermi liquids has been justified microscopically with the self - consistent quantum field theory , @xcite which in turn enabled leggett to extend the landau theory to superfluid fermi liquids .",
    "@xcite    among those self - consistent approximations is baym s @xmath0-derivable approximation with a unique property of obeying various dynamical conservation laws automatically .",
    "@xcite this is certainly a character indispensable for describing nonequilibrium phenomena but not met by the simple perturbation expansion .",
    "indeed , the @xmath0-derivable approximation seems the only systematic microscopic scheme within the quantum field theory which enables us to study equilibrium and nonequilibrium phenomena on an equal footing .",
    "it includes the hartree - fock theory and the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory of superconductivity as notable examples .",
    "moreover , the boltzmann equation can be derived as a special case of the @xmath0-derivable approximation .",
    "@xcite    the key functional @xmath1 $ ] above was introduced by luttinger and ward @xcite as part of the exact equilibrium thermodynamic potential for the normal state in terms of the matsubara green s function @xmath2 .",
    "based on a self - consistent perturbation expansion , the expression also provides a systematic approximation scheme with the desirable property of including the exact theory as a limit .",
    "@xcite indeed , luttinger @xcite subsequently used the luttinger - ward functional to obtain some general results on normal fermi systems such as the fermi - surface sum rule anticipated by landau .",
    "@xcite note that nonequilibrium systems can be handled with essentially the same techniques as equilibrium cases by a mere change from the imaginary - time matsubara contour into the real - time keldysh contour .",
    "@xcite    thus , it would be useful to have a practical @xmath0-derivable approximation of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) with broken u(1 ) symmetry , where quite a few dynamical experiments have been carried out @xcite since the realization of the bose - einstein condensation with a trapped atomic gas in 1995 .",
    "@xcite another key ingredient here is the presence of a gapless excitation in the long wave - length limit , as first proved by hugenholtz and pines .",
    "@xcite this branch , which corresponds to the bogoliubov mode in the weak - coupling regime , @xcite can be identified now as the nambu - goldstone boson @xcite of the spontaneously broken u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "the importance of the two features , i.e. , `` conserving '' and `` gapless , '' for describing interacting condensed bosons was already pointed out by hohenberg and martin @xcite in 1965 and also emphasized by griffin @xcite soon after the realization of the bose - einstein condensation in the trapped atomic gases . despite considerable efforts ,",
    "however , few systematic approximation schemes for bec have been known to date which satisfy the two fundamental properties simultaneously .",
    "a notable exception may be the dielectric formalism .",
    "@xcite it is designed specifically to describe another important feature of interacting condensed bosons that the single - particle spectrum and the two - particle density spectrum coincide , as first shown by gavoret and nozire .",
    "@xcite by incorporating local number conservation additionally , it has provided the gapless spectrum of a weakly interacting homogeneous bose gas beyond the leading order.@xcite however , a generalization of the formalism to inhomogeneous or nonequilibrium situations seems not straightforward when experiments on atomic gases are carried out with trap potentials dynamically .",
    "@xcite    now , the main purpose of the present paper is to develop a self - consistent perturbation expansion for bec satisfying goldstone s theorem @xcite and dynamical conservation laws simultaneously .",
    "this will be carried out by extending the normal - state luttinger - ward functional @xcite so as to obey a couple of exact relations for bec , i.e. , that for the interaction energy and the hugenholtz - pines relation .",
    "the two relations will be shown to yield a unique identical result for the functional @xmath0 of bec at least up to the third order in the self - consistent perturbation expansion .",
    "the fact indicates that the series becomes exact when infinite terms are retained .",
    "it also turns out that the expansion reproduces the conserving - gapless mean field theory developed earlier with a subtraction procedure @xcite as the lowest - order approximation .",
    "the formulation will be carried out in the coordinate space so that it is applicable to inhomogeneous systems such as those under trap potentials and with vortices . using the keldysh green s functions",
    ", we will also extend it to describe nonequilibrium behaviors .",
    "those are subjects with many unresolved issues @xcite which can not be treated by other theoretical methods for bec such as the variational approach @xcite and the monte - carlo method .",
    "@xcite the whole contents here are relevant to single - particle properties , and we are planning to discuss two - particle properties in the near future .",
    "the formalism will find a wide range of applications on bec .",
    "they include : ( i ) clarifying molecular field effects in condensed bose systems corresponding to the landau theory of fermi liquids ; ( ii ) nonequilibrium phenomena of bec such as thermalization with full account of the quasiparticle collisions ; ( iii ) microscopic derivation of landau two - fluid equations with definite interaction and temperature dependences of the viscosity coefficient , etc.it will also be helpful to construct a practical functional for bec within the density - functional formalism , which still seems absent .",
    "it is worth pointing out finally that the luttinger - ward functional is known as the `` two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) action '' in the relativistic quantum - field theory,@xcite and the difficulties mentioned above are also encountered in describing its broken symmetry phases such as that of the @xmath3 theory .",
    "@xcite thus , the present issue is relevant to a wide range of theoretical physics beyond bec .",
