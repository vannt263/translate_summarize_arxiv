    "nonequilibrium phenomena are well understood for states near equilibrium . however , even the qualitative features of transport and fluctuations far from equilibrium are poorly understood , due to the complexity of the physical states and the lack of an adequate controlled theoretical description in general .",
    "it is useful in this context to consider more restrictive conditions and specialized states for which greater progress in this difficult area can be made .",

    "the corresponding hydrodynamic equations are obtained , including explicit expressions for the associated transport coefficients . in principle , this method applies to states far from equilibrium as well , although calculation of the chapman - enskog expansion to higher orders in the gradients is prohibitively difficult and questions of convergence remain unresolved .",
    "an alternative approach is to expand in small gradients about a more relevant reference state than local equilibrium .",
    "for example , consider states near a homogeneous reference steady state .",
    "deviations of the hydrodynamic variables from their values in this state are characterized by small relative spatial gradients .",
    "a modified chapman - enskog expansion can be implemented to obtain the distribution function and hydrodynamic equations to leading order in these gradients .",
    "since the reference state can be far from equilibrium the form of the hydrodynamic equations and the dependence of the transport coefficients on parameters of the steady state will be quite different from those for states near equilibrium .    in practice",
    "this program has not been carried out since determination of a non - trivial reference steady state far from the equilibrium from the boltzmann equation is exceptionally rare @xcite . in contrast , exact results have been obtained for a number of physically interesting special steady states @xcite using a model kinetic equation designed to preserve the essential features of the boltzmann equation while admitting more practical analysis @xcite . in some cases these results",
    "have been compared with those from monte carlo simulation far from equilibrium , indicating that the kinetic model provides both a qualitative and semi - quantitative representation of the underlying boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "the objective here is to use this kinetic model approach for the special class of states at or near uniform shear flow .",
    "uniform shear flow is a particularly well - studied nonequilibrium state using numerical methods ( both monte carlo at low density @xcite and molecular dynamics simulation at high density @xcite ) , illustrating rheological properties normally associated with complex molecular fluids@xcite .",
    "more importantly , it is one of the special cases for which an exact solution to the model kinetic equation has been obtained @xcite , providing the necessary reference state for the modified chapman - enskog expansion developed here .",
    "we look for solutions to the kinetic equation as an expansion in small spatial gradients relative to an exact solution for local uniform shear rather than around local equilibrium .",

    "in this section the kinetic theory is defined , the associated macroscopic conservation laws obtained , and the special solution for steady uniform shear flow is described . in the next section , this solution is generalized to a local reference state for an expansion to describe a class of states near uniform shear flow and to obtain the associated hydrodynamic equations .",

    "dynamical properties of states far from equilibrium are not well understood due to their complexity and technical difficulties with the formal theories of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "however at low density the boltzmann kinetic theory provides a controlled formulation of this problem .",
    "there are still difficulties for practical applications so a kinetic model has been used to allow a detailed analysis for a special class of states near uniform shear flow .",
    "first , the bgk - boltzmann equation was solved exactly for the steady state distribution at uniform shear flow , and the corresponding transport properties given as a function of the shear rate .",
    "next , a solution to the kinetic equation was obtained for a class of states deviating from uniform shear flow by small spatial gradients in the hydrodynamic fields , using a variant of the chapman - enskog approximation method . by `` variant '' is meant that a local form of the stationary solution for shear flow is used as a reference function rather than the local equilibrium distribution function . in general",
    "this reference state is very different from a maxwellian and can be very far from equilibrium if the shear rate is large .",
    "the chapman - enskog expansion was used to determine the distribution function to first order in the gradients .",
    "the result is a",
    " normal solution  for which all space and time dependence occurs through the hydrodynamic fields .",
    "these fields must be determined from hydrodynamic equations which follow from the exact conservation laws .",
    "the irreversible parts of the hydrodynamic fluxes were determined as functions of the hydrodynamic fields and their gradients using the normal solution with results of the form @xmath230 for the momentum flux and @xmath231 for the heat flux .",
    "since these coefficients are calculated near the stationary state of broken symmetry there are many new transport coefficients ( @xmath232 , @xmath233 , @xmath234 ) , in comparison to the case of states near equilibrium , which depend on the shear rate . with these new expressions for the fluxes , a closed set of the generalized hydrodynamic equations was derived near uniform shear flow . in summary , a complete description at both the kinetic and hydrodynamic levels has been given for a wide class of states arbitrarily far from equilibrium .",
    "in particular , the analysis provides a rare example of the relevance of a hydrodynamic description far from equilibrium .",
    "the corresponding hydrodynamic modes were calculated to order @xmath235 for arbitrary shear rate from the linearized hydrodynamic equations .",
    "an unexpected result is an instability for any finite value of the shear rate at sufficiently long wavelengths .",
    "this prediction has been verified quantitatively by comparison with direct monte carlo computer simulation of the kinetic equation , confirming the validity of the hydrodynamic description @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic analysis was carried out here only for spatial variations along the velocity gradient .",
    "more complex dynamics is expected in the general case of arbitrary direction for the spatial perturbation and a description will be given elsewhere .",
    "in addition to the stable and unstable exponential time dependence of the hydrodynamic modes , there will be algebraic modulations due to the fact that the hydrodynamic matrix at @xmath189 can not be diagonalized .",
    "this can lead to initial growth of perturbations of uniform shear flow even when the hydrodynamic modes are stable .",
    "the approach taken here can be extended to several other physically interesting reference non - equilibrium states such as a constant temperature gradient , or combined heat and momentum transport .",
    "exact solutions to the bgk kinetic equation are known for these cases @xcite so the reference distribution for the chapman - enskog expansion is available .",
    "other directions of extension include applications at higher densities .",
    "recently , a bgk - like kinetic model for the dense fluid enskog kinetic equation has been described and applied with success to shear flow @xcite .",
    "this provides theoretical access to densities relevant for molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "although attention has been focused on transport the analysis can be extended in a straightforward way to describe fluctuations in uniform shear flow .",
    "the reason for this is the close relationship of the kinetic equations for fluctuations to that for transport @xcite .",
    "for example , the kinetic equation for phase space fluctuations at two times is governed by the linearization of the kinetic equation for transport . as a consequence",
    ", the linear hydrodynamic equations studied in section 4 also can be used to compute the hydrodynamic part of time correlation functions such as the dynamic structure factor measured in light scattering . recently",
    ", kinetic models for fluctuations have been developed that are self - consistent with the bgk kinetic model for transport @xcite .",
    "their detailed application to fluctuations in uniform shear flow , including anomalous long range spatial correlations @xcite will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the authors wish to thank j.j.brey , j. lutsko , and a. santos for valuable discussions .",
    "this research was supported in part by nsf grant phy 9312723 and the division of sponsored research at the university of florida .",
    "to establish a steady state for uniform shear flow a non - conservative external force is introduced in section [ sec : kinetic ] to compensate for viscous heating generated by the lees - edwards boundary conditions . in section [ sec : hydro ] for states _ near _ uniform shear flow , a local form for this non - conservative force is used @xmath236 with this local form it is possible to impose @xmath237 , which led to the results that @xmath32 is the same as @xmath238 at uniform shear flow given by ( [ lambda ] ) , except that the temperature and density are replaced by those for the general nonequilibrium state .",
    "the resulting hydrodynamic equations express viscous heating only due to the gradients relative to uniform shear flow .",
    "an alternative choice is to use the simpler case of the constant @xmath239 in ( [ app : localf ] ) even for states near uniform shear flow .",
    "the advantage of this choice is a simpler implementation of the monte carlo simulation method for the solution to the kinetic model equations .",
    "obviously , it is consistent with the conditions for the steady state uniform shear flow .",
    "however , this choice only partially compensates for the viscous heating at local uniform shear flow , i.e. , @xmath240 . in this appendix ,",
    "the changes from the results of section [ sec : hydro ] in both the chapman - enskog solution and the hydrodynamic equations due to this alternative choice are described .",
    "to lowest order in the uniformity parameter the bgk equation with the new thermostat becomes , @xmath241 here and below it is understood that @xmath242 is independent of space and time . since the solution is normal , its time dependence occurs only through the hydrodynamic variables and the contributions from the time derivative , @xmath243 , can be calculated using the conservation laws to lowest order in the uniformity parameter , @xmath244 @xmath245 these differ from the results of the section [ sec : hydro ] because it is no longer possible to choose @xmath52 to compensates for the viscous heating , i.e. , @xmath246 .",

    "the analysis is simplest for maxwell molecules where @xmath249 is independent of the temperature . then @xmath250 ( as is verified a posteriori ) and the solution to eq.([f0eq:1 ] )",

    "( [ lamrel:2 ] ) , showing that @xmath254 has the same functional dependence on @xmath34 , @xmath256 , and @xmath72 .",
    "this proves that the zeroth order solutions to the bgk - boltzmann equation , ( [ newf0 ] ) and ( [ f0 ] ) , for the two different thermostats are the same .",
    "the lowest order equations for the temperature differ , however .",
    "use of ( [ w ] ) in ( [ newt ] ) gives ,    @xmath257    which vanishes only at the steady state .",
    "now consider the first order solution in the chapman - enskog expansion , @xmath258 and look for solutions of the form , @xmath259 the equations for the coefficients , @xmath260 , are determined from substitution of into the ( [ f1eq ] ) and they are @xmath261 where @xmath262 represent cartesian coordinate .",
    "the functions @xmath99 are same as those given in appendix b. since the equations for @xmath263 are different from ( [ xeq ] ) , the transport coefficients for the heat flux , @xmath264 , are also different for this new thermostat .",
