    "recent discovery @xcite of a medium - temperature superconductivity in magnesium diboride ( mgb@xmath0 ) raised questions about the origin and properties of superconductivity in this compound . mgb@xmath0 has a hexagonal crystal structure with boron layers interleaved by magnesium layers . due to this layered structure , normal state electric transport , as well as superconducting properties",
    "should be highly anisotropic .",
    "band structure calculations @xcite indicate that electrons at the fermi level are predominantly derived from boron atoms .",
    "mgb@xmath0 may be regarded as sheets of metallic boron with strong covalent intralayer bonding , separated by mg layers with ionic interlayer b - mg bonding .",
    "the strong b - b bonding induces enhanced electron - phonon interaction , so that the superconductivity in mgb@xmath2 is mainly due to the charge carriers in the boron planes .",
    "experimental investigations on single crystals and @xmath3-oriented epitaxial and textured films ( see , e.g. , the review @xcite and references therein ) give evidence for a highly anisotropic superconducting gap .",
    "measured critical magnetic fields usually show a pronounced anisotropy for @xmath4-oriented films and single crystals @xcite . applying the anisotropic ginzburg - landau model to these measurements , authors derive an effective mass anisotropy for the charge carriers of @xmath5 thus",
    ", band structure calculations and experimental measurements strongly suggest that superconductivity nucleates at the quasi - two - dimensional ( quasi-@xmath6 ) boron planes , and then extends through the magnesium layers by a nanoscale proximity effect forming an anisotropic @xmath7 superconducting state in the material .    in this letter we present experimental evidence for @xmath6 nucleation of superconductivity in a @xmath8 magnesium diboride film . to demonstrate this , we measured the temperature dependence of excess conductivity caused by fluctuations above @xmath9 if quasi-@xmath6 boron planes are responsible for the superconductivity , then the excess conductivity should exhibit @xmath6 behavior although measured in a @xmath8 sample .",
    "we found that the temperature dependence of the excess conductivity agrees well with the aslamazov - larkin @xcite theory of superconducting fluctuations in @xmath6 superconductors .",
    "the mgb@xmath0 films were prepared by dc magnetron sputtering on single crystalline mgo ( 101 ) substrate according the procedure described in @xcite . to compensate losses of magnesium due to its oxidation in plasma , a composite target was used which contained mgb@xmath0 and metallic magnesium in approximately equal amounts .",
    "the mg - mgb@xmath0 pellet was sputtered in a 99,999% purity argon atmosphere at a pressure of 3 pa .",
    "the substrate temperature during sputtering was held at 200 @xmath10c and than raised to 600 @xmath10c for several seconds at the final stage . at this final _ in situ _ annealing the plasma discharge was not switched off .",
    "x - ray studies revealed a strongly textured ( 101)-oriented structure of our films .",
    "films of 30 nm thickness have been used for resistance and critical field measurements .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath11 obtained by a conventional four - terminal resistive method at zero field , was about 19.5k .",
    "the upper critical fields parallel ( @xmath12 ) and perpendicular ( b@xmath13 ) to the film plane have been measured using the 7 t superconducting magnet of a  mpms xl quantum design  squid magnetometer .    the resistive transitions , @xmath14 at constant perpendicular magnetic field for one of the investigated samples are plotted in fig.1 .",
    "the transition width at zero field , according to a ( 10 - 90)% @xmath15 criterion , is about @xmath16k and slightly increases in stronger magnetic field to about 1k at 6 t .",
    "the temperature dependence of the critical fields is displayed in fig.2 .",
    "it shows a pronounced anisotropy , @xmath17 in accordance with previous studies , reporting values of @xmath18 for @xmath3-oriented films and 2.4 - 2.7 for single crystals @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath19 is linear except for temperatures very close to the critical temperature .",
    "the @xmath20 dependence starts nearly linear , and then increases more rapidly .",
    "we obtain the ginzburg - landau coherence length , @xmath21 from the slopes of @xmath22 and @xmath20 close to the critical temperature @xcite , @xmath23 ^{-1/2 } ,   \\label{eq0}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the magnetic flux quantum .",
    "calculations according to ( [ eq0 ] ) give @xmath25 nm , @xmath26 nm , much less than the film thickness @xmath27 nm . the linear temperature dependence of @xmath19 gives evidence that the film is three dimensional with respect to superconductivity .",
    "especially , the absence of a square - root temperature dependence of @xmath19 clearly demonstrates that the films show no indication for @xmath6 superconductivity . for the deviation of @xmath20 from the linear behavior",
    "several reasons may be responsible , such as : anisotropy of the energy gap , proximity effect due to the weakly superconducting mg interlayers in the mgb@xmath0 compound @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear behavior of @xmath20 is commonly observed in mgb@xmath0 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    using our data on the temperature dependence of the resistance at zero dc magnetic field we calculate the fluctuation conductance by the relation @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath15 is the normal state resistance , @xmath29 is the effective dimensionality of a superconductor ( @xmath30 ) , and @xmath31 is the aslamazov - larkin critical temperature@xcite .",
    "if the effective dimensionality of superconducting fluctuations is @xmath32 , then according to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) we expect a linear dependence of the inverse excess conductance on temperature : @xmath33 ^{-1}=\\frac{r_{n}}{\\tau _ { al}}\\frac{% \\left ( t - t_{c}^{al}\\right ) } { t_{c}^{al } } ,   \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] with @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the normal state sheet resistance of the film .",
    "3 shows the temperature dependence of the inverse excess conductance normalized by the normal state conductance . the intersection of the linear approximation by eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) with the abscissa gives the critical temperature @xmath31 , while the slope of the line provides the value of @xmath37 . in fig .",
    "3 we also show the fit according to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) for the case @xmath38 obviously , the @xmath6-fit describes the experimental data much better then @xmath8-fit . using the experimental values of the slope of the @xmath6-fit we calculate the effective normal state sheet resistance by eqs .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) : @xmath39 for a homogeneous @xmath6 film this value should be identical to that one obtained from the measurement of the resistance in the normal state above the critical temperature , @xmath40 .",
    "since , however , @xmath41 is about 60 times smaller than  the effective sheet resistance ( [ eq5 ] ) our sample must be a stack of a large number of parallel boron sheets .",
    "the number of the sheets , @xmath42 , which are involved in the sheet resistance of our mgb@xmath0 film , may be estimated as @xmath43 in that case the effective interlayer spacing of the boron sheets can be obtained from the film thickness , @xmath44 as follows @xmath45 which is not far from the @xmath3-axis spacing @xmath46 nm @xcite .",
    "thus , we may conclude that the description of superconducting fluctuations above @xmath47 in the framework of a two - dimensional model is consistent with our experiment .    in summary",
    ", we have measured the resistance and critical fields of mgb@xmath0 films prepared on mgo substrate . from the linear temperature dependence of the critical fields we established anisotropic three - dimensional superconductivity of our films . from the resistivity measurements we showed that the temperature dependence of fluctuation conductivity above @xmath47 agrees with the aslamazov - larkin theory for @xmath6 superconductor .",
    "we consider this finding as an experimental evidence for two - dimensional nucleation of superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 .",
