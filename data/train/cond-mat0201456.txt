    "establishing a link between macroscopic laws of diffusion and relaxation with a microscopic master equation for atomic degrees of freedom has remained a fundamental problem in non  equilibrium statistical mechanics . moreover , numerous examples exist in metallurgy , semiconductor device technology , glass science and polymer science , where control over the time  development of microstructures is crucial in the design of materials with special mechanical , electrical and magnetic properties .",
    "hence there is a need also from a practical viewpoint to derive tractable kinetic equations incorporating specific materials properties , so that processes like nucleation , spinodal decomposition and magnetic relaxation can be treated in a realistic manner .",
    "the simplest approach is to study mean  field kinetic equations , derived from the master equation by neglecting any atomic correlation effects @xcite .",
    "such equations suffer from the obvious drawback that their stationary solutions yield the mean  field phase diagram , which may differ even qualitatively from the correct phase diagram .",
    "several routes for improvement have been proposed in the literature , including the path probability method @xcite , effective hamiltonian methods @xcite or time  dependent density functional theory ( tdft ) @xcite .",
    "the latter approach implements the idea of local equilibrium and leads to thermodynamic driving forces which in principle are derived from an exact free energy functional .",
    "density functional theories are normally formulated for continuous fluid systems @xcite , but adaptation to discrete lattice systems is straightforward @xcite . in this way one can obtain generalized mean  field kinetic equations for single  particle or single  spin densities which in principle are consistent with the exact equilibrium properties .",
    "if necessary , additional approximations with respect to equilibrium quantities can be carried out in a separate step .",
    "+ the above  mentioned kinetic theories mostly focus on purely dissipative processes in discrete lattice systems . for fluid systems ,",
    "the derivation of nonlinear transport equations for hydrodynamic variables is a more complicated subject .",
    "some generalizations of moris well  known projection operator technique and mode coupling approximations to situations far away from equilibrium @xcite have been applied , for example , to problems of nonlinear hydrodynamics , the glass transition @xcite and to granular flows @xcite .",
    "+ our aim in this paper is to apply the tdft scheme to purely dissipative `` conserved '' atomic migration and `` non  conserved '' spin dynamics processes in one  dimensional lattice models for which the exact free energy functional is known .",
    "this enables us to separate out and to test the local equilibrium assumption against monte carlo simulation .",
    "specifically , we study the temporal evolution of domains with different ordering , and of the associated interface .",
    "it is demonstrated that in these problems the tdft shows remarkable quantitative accuracy , suggesting that this method may be useful also under more general conditions .    in section 2",
    "we briefly recall our basic approach .",
    "section 3 starts out with an exact free energy functional for a one  dimensional lattice and provides expressions for local correlators in terms of particle densities . with these results",
    "we arrive at a closed system of kinetic equations on the single  particle level . following the classification by hohenberg and halperin @xcite these equations",
    "take the form of generalized `` model b '' or `` model a '' equations in cases of a conserved or a non  conserved order parameter , respectively . solving these equations",
    ", we subsequently discuss the time  evolution of an initially sharp interface between two differently ordered domains in both of these cases ( section 4 ) .",
    "excellent agreement with monte carlo simulations is found , in contrast to ordinary mean  field ( mf ) theory which produces substantial deviations .",
    "let us begin with hopping of particles on a lattice of equivalent sites @xmath0 , which are either simply occupied ( @xmath1 ) or vacant ( @xmath2 ) , so that occupation numbers satisfy @xmath3 .",
    "the hopping process is described by a master equation for probabilities @xmath4 of finding an occupational configuration @xmath5 at time @xmath6 . as elementary steps",
    "we assume moves of a single particle from an occupied site to a vacant nearest neighbor site .",

    "@xmath0 and @xmath8 to exchange their occupation satisfy the detailed balance condition with respect to a given lattice gas hamiltonian @xmath9 .",
    "a detailed description of tdft is found in ref .",
    "hence we need to recall only the main steps , and add some remarks as to their physical content .",

    "particle fields @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is a normalization factor , which at equilibrium ( @xmath13 ) reduces to the canonical partition function . requiring self ",
    "consistency on the single  particle level allows us to eliminate @xmath14 in favor of mean occupation numbers @xmath15 with @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes an average with respect to the distribution ( [ eq : ploc ] ) . in this way a closed system of equations for @xmath18 can be derived .    to carry through this program we start from the equation of continuity which follows directly from the original master equation .",
    "replacement of exact averages by local equilibrium averages gives @xmath19 with known expressions @xcite for the current @xmath20 from site @xmath0 to site @xmath8 in terms of @xmath7 .",
    "notice that at any instant of time the exponent in ( [ eq : ploc ] ) describes an inhomogeneous lattice gas which involves a spatially varying single  particle potential @xmath14 .",
    "hence , calculation of averages from ( [ eq : ploc ] ) is precisely the kind of problem treated by density functional theory ( dft ) in classical statistical mechanics .",
    "there , one considers a class of systems with fixed interactions and arbitrary single ",
    "particle potentials , specified here by @xmath9 and @xmath21 , respectively . averaged occupation numbers and correlation functions are determined from derivatives of a free energy functional @xmath22 associated with the hamiltonian @xmath23 .",
    "specifically , @xmath18 is determined by the set of equations @xmath24 with @xmath25 the overall chemical potential , and @xmath26 the local chemical potential as functional of @xmath27 .",
    "much experience has been gained during the last two decades how to construct @xmath22 from a given hamiltonian @xmath9 . in the subsequent considerations we therefore assume @xmath22 to be known . since in the framework of dft occupational correlation functions",
    "are functionals of @xmath27 , we can formally regard ( [ eq : dpi ] ) as the desired closed set of equations for @xmath18 .    in order to make this procedure explicit and to establish a connection with thermodynamic driving forces",

    "physically , equation ( [ eq : mik ] ) tells us that the mobility coefficient based on ( [ eq : wik ] ) is given by the nearest",
    " neighbor vacancy correlator .",
    "it should be kept in mind that in this tdft ",
    "scheme all deviations from equilibrium are described in a mean  field manner in the sense that the underlying distribution function ( [ eq : ploc ] ) deviates from the canonical distribution merely by single  particle terms .",
    "relationships between occupational correlators and densities @xmath18 , which enter this theory , are local in time and are given by the equilibrium theory .",
    "this implies the assumption that correlators relax fast to their local equilibrium values , compared with time scales characterizing the evolution of @xmath18 .",
    "ordinary kinetic mean ",
    "field theory is recovered when we use mean  field expressions for @xmath39 and replace ( [ eq : mik ] ) by @xmath40 . by contrast , in tdft the local chemical potential appearing in ( [ eq : ait ] ) is defined by the exact chemical potential functional so that ( [ eq : dpi ] ) together with ( [ eq : jik ] ) describes relaxation towards the exact equilibrium state . moreover , the expression ( [ eq : mik ] ) for the mobility preserves local correlation effects in the jump dynamics .      to exemplify the dynamics of a non",
    " conserved order parameter , we study spin  relaxation in a kinetic ising model . elementary transitions in the underlying master equation",
    "are supposed to be individual spin flips @xmath41 , where @xmath42 . by @xmath43",
    "we denote the associated rate in an initial spin configuration @xmath44 .",
    "the local equilibrium distribution @xmath45 is analogous to ( [ eq : ploc ] ) .",
    "it involves the ising hamiltonian @xmath46 supplemented by time ",

    "as shown in the appendix , the equations of motion read @xmath48 with kinetic coefficients @xmath49 @xmath50 is the intrinsic free energy functional associated with the exchange interaction , and @xmath51 an overall constant magnetic field . equation ( [ eq : dsi ] ) again displays the exact thermodynamic driving force in the spirit of tdft .",
    "it can be regarded as a generalized `` model a '' equation in the classification by hohenberg and halperin @xcite , whereas eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dpi ] ) , ( [ eq : jik ] ) and ( [ eq : ait ] ) constitute generalized `` model b '' equations .",

    "term in ( [ eq : dsi ] ) to obtain @xmath52 .",
    "the kinetic coefficient is then simply given by the equilibrium spin flip rate @xmath53 .",
    "finally it is easy to show that our evolution equations are consistent with the second law of thermodynamics : the total free energy decreases monotonously with time until the equilibrium condition is satisfied . for hopping , the rate of change of the free energy is given by @xmath54 where we have used ( [ eq : dpi ] ) , ( [ eq : jik ] ) and ( [ eq : ait ] ) together with the abbreviation @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "currents through the boundaries of the system are supposed to be zero .",
    "the inequality in ( [ eq : df ] ) arises from @xmath57 , see ( [ eq : mik ] ) , and from @xmath58 for @xmath59 . the equality sign in ( [ eq : df ] ) holds if and only if @xmath60 for all @xmath0 and @xmath8 , which means that @xmath61 .",
    "similarly , for the kinetic ising spin model , the total free energy including the coupling to the external field @xmath51 satisfies @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",

    "to test the local equilibrium distribution ( [ eq : ploc ] ) it is desirable to avoid any approximation with respect to static properties .",

    "given these relations , it turns out that @xmath78 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath50 may be minimized also with respect to correlators in cases where these can not be calculated explicitly .",
    "the boundary conditions for the correlators are @xmath79 and @xmath80 . for @xmath81 , combination of ( [ eq : pi+1 ] ) with ( [ eq : pi1 ] )",
    "yields a quadratic equation for @xmath82 . in this way the representation of @xmath73 as functionals of @xmath27 is completed .",
    "the fact that @xmath73 only depends on @xmath83 and @xmath84 clearly is a special feature in one dimension .",
    "the kinetic equations derived in section 2 are now combined with ( [ eq : fp ] ) .",
    "evidently , from ( [ eq : mik ] ) , @xmath85 while the local chemical potential is found to satisfy @xmath86 from ( [ eq : jik ] ) , ( [ eq : mii ] ) and ( [ eq : beta ] ) we obtain for the current @xmath87.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in these last equations ( [ eq : mii])([eq : jii ] ) , densities and correlators are local equilibrium quantities .",
    "the final form of our kinetic equations as a nonlinear set of differential equations for @xmath88 emerges when we reexpress @xmath73 in terms of @xmath83 and @xmath84 in the way described above .    for comparison",

    ", we can treat the correlators @xmath101 in perfect analogy to @xmath102 .",

    "[ fig1 ] for @xmath113 in the case of a repulsive interaction with @xmath114 .",
    "generally , the shape of profiles depends on how the interaction enters the elementary hopping rates . our choice ( [ eq : wik ] ) implies that in regions with densities @xmath115 a particle next to a vacant target site has a large chance to be repelled by another particle and hence will assume a large jump rate .",
    "by contrast , the repulsion will be less active in dilute regions .",
    "this explains the asymmetry of the profiles in fig .",

    "by contrast , the mf ",

    "[ fig1]a .    for diffusion processes on ( continuous ) length scales @xmath117 and time scales @xmath6 much larger than the elementary hopping distance and residence time ,",
    "we expect the density to depend only on the scaling variable @xmath118 , provided the initial conditions can be expressed in terms of @xmath119 .",

    "[ fig2]a up to @xmath126 , and the results for @xmath123 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b . using the mf profile",

    "this quantity is calculated easily by separating from the current ( [ eq : jmf ] ) a factor @xmath128 , i.e. a discrete gradient of the density , and identifying the result with ficks law .",

    "the tdft  diffusion constant , however , shows a much sharper maximum .",
    "moreover , when @xmath127 becomes small , it approaches the value @xmath133 more rapidly , and thus gives rise to the steepening of the density profile in the regime @xmath134 , as observed in fig .",
    "this is a correlation effect : in a dilute system , a fast hop of a particle due to the repulsion by a neighboring particle is a rare event because nearest neighbor pairs get suppressed , @xmath135 , and hence diffusion is slowed down relative to the mf  prediction .",
    "this argument is supplementary to our previous discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig1]a .",
    "at this point we remark that such correlations induced by the repulsion of particles are taken into account to a certain extent even by mf ",
    "theory when applied to a two  sublattice structure .",
    "density profiles and effective diffusion coefficients calculated in this way in a previous study @xcite indeed are similar to those of the present tdft calculation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a and [ fig2]b , respectively .",
    "because of the important role played by the correlators in tdft it is of interest to make a direct comparison with correlators obtained from monte carlo simulation .",
    "[ fig3 ] exemplifies perfect agreement between those of tdft and simulation , whereas mf ",

    "we choose a chain of length @xmath137 and fixed upward spins at the boundaries , @xmath138 .",
    "our initial condition at @xmath109 now is @xmath139 for @xmath140 and @xmath141 for the remaining spins .",
    "notice that in the case @xmath97 simple mf  theory in the spirit of this work becomes exact because the correlators in ( [ eq : dsit ] ) drop out . to depart from this",
    "trivial situation we introduce a small field with @xmath142 which favors downward spin orientation .",

    "[ fig4]a , where the full lines correspond to tdft , and data points to simulation .",
    "the agreement is very good , although not perfect .",
    "generally , the spins in the interior of the system relax towards the equilibrium in the external field .",
    "spins near the boundary are expected to relax towards an equilibrium profile which decays from the boundary ( @xmath145 ) towards the interior ( @xmath146 ) on a length given by the correlation length @xmath147 .",
    "for the temperature considered , @xmath148 .    during the course of this relaxation , simple mf  theory , based on a factorization of the last two terms in ( [ eq : dsit ] ) ,",
    "gives quite different results ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]b ) .",
    "first of all , the overall process is much faster than in fig .",
    "second , within the region of the initial upspin domain it predicts a constantly decreasing plateau which is not observed in fig .",
    "the origin of these failures of mf  theory becomes clear when we look at fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] : monte carlo and the almost identical tdft ",
    "correlators @xmath99 stay close to unity throughout the system , in contrast to the mf ",
    "factorization , and stabilize the respective spin configuration .",
    "hence the relaxation process progresses only by a successive broadening of the interfacial region between the upspin and downspin domains and not by a decaying plateau .",
    "applying a local equilibrium approximation to the master equation for atomic or spin configurations , kinetic equations for particle or spin densities were derived , which are compatible with the exact thermodynamics .",
    "the derivation was largely based on concepts from density functional theory .",
    "kinetic equations obtained have the form of generalized `` model b '' or `` model a '' equations in the language of ref .",
    "@xcite , where thermodynamic driving forces originate from the exact free energy functional .",
    "this `` time  dependent density functional '' ( tdft)scheme is tested against monte carlo simulations for both a one  dimensional hopping model and the glauber model , where the exact free  energy functional is known .",
    "studying the dynamics of the interface between different domains , the tdft yields excellent agreement with simulations with respect to density or spin density profiles and local correlation functions .",
    "the success of this theory appears to be a consequence of the fast relaxation of correlators towards their local equilibrium values .    under the ultimate aim to develop theoretical tools for a description of phase transformation",
    "processes in real materials , several extensions of the present work are necessary .",
    "first of all , one needs reliable approximations for the free energy functional in higher dimensions . for two  dimensional lattice systems , a step in this direction has been taken recently @xcite , which was based on an extension of the techniques in ref .",
    "secondly , one would like to treat multicomponent systems . in that case ,",

    "<S> time  dependent density functional theory , proposed recently in the context of atomic diffusion and non  equilibrium processes in solids , is tested against monte carlo simulation . in order to assess the basic approximation of that theory , the representation of non  equilibrium states by a local equilibrium distribution function </S>",
    "<S> , we focus on one  dimensional lattice models , where all equilibrium properties can be worked exactly from the known free energy as a functional of the density . </S>",
    "<S> this functional determines the thermodynamic driving forces away from equilibrium . in our studies of the interfacial kinetics of atomic hopping and spin relaxation , we find excellent agreement with simulations , suggesting that the method is useful also for treating more complex problems . </S>"
