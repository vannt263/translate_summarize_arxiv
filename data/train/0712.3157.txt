    "many efforts are recently being done in order to understand the supernova evolution .",
    "of particular interest is the scenario in the aftermath of a core bounce , where a large number of neutrinos is produced and radiated out towards the infalling matter from the outer layers onto the core .",
    "the mean free path of the neutrinos and their interaction with matter can be an explanation for the mantle ejection during the explosion . in @xcite the opacity of the nuclear non - uniform neutron - rich matter",
    "is calculated in a semiclassical approach to describe neutrino scattering . in the present work we will investigate some general properties of the non - uniform matter at the crust of a compact star within different relativistic models . in particular we will investigate the dynamical collective unstable modes and study the isospin content of the non - homogeneous phase of asymmetric nuclear matter .    in two previous works @xcite",
    "we have investigated the influence of the electromagnetic interaction and the presence of electrons on the unstable modes of npe matter at zero and finite temperature within the nl3 parametrization of the non - linear walecka model ( nlwm ) @xcite .",
    "this parametrization describes the ground - state properties of both stable and unstable nuclei .",
    "models with density - dependent meson - nucleon couplings are an alternative approach for the description of nuclear matter and finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "non - linear self - interactions of the mesons in constant coupling models are substituted by density - dependent meson - nucleon coupling parameters and are motivated by dirac - brueckner calculations of nuclear matter .",
    "the parametrization introduced by typel and wolter , which we will refer as tw @xcite , describes finite nuclei and nuclear matter with similar quality as non - linear parametrizations and has a more reasonable extrapolation to extreme conditions : high density and large charge asymmetry . in @xcite",
    "a parametrization denoted dd - me1 used the same density dependence of tw for the coupling parameters , but adjusted the parameters in a different way .",
    "more recently the parametrization dd - me2 @xcite has been developed as an improvement of dd - me1 in order to obtain better fittings to excitation energies of isoscalar monopole and isovector dipole giant resonances .",
    "other possibilities for density dependent parametrizations are found in the literature @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the thermodynamical instabilities at subsaturation densities of nlwm parametrizations with constant couplings differ from the behavior of relativistic nuclear models with density - dependent parameters . in particular , in the last models the distillation effect is not so strong and follows more closely the behavior of non - relativistic nuclear models . in the present work we will study the dynamical instabilities within density - dependent relativistic models ( ddrm ) and will compare them with the results obtained with the nl3 parametrization of nlwm .",
    "this investigation will be performed in the framework of the vlasov formalism @xcite .",
    "we will study the role of isospin and the modification of the distillation phenomenon due to the presence of the coulomb field and electrons .    in section",
    "ii we review the vlasov equation formalism for nuclear neutral matter including electrons and the electromagnetic field . in section",
    "iii the dispersion relation is displayed and in section iv the numerical results are shown and discussed .",
    "finally , in the last section the most important conclusions are drawn .",
    "we start from the lagrangian density of the relativistic tw model @xcite including electrons interacting with the electromagnetic field @xmath0\\psi + \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi\\partial^{\\mu}\\phi -m_s^2 \\phi^2 ) -\\frac{1}{4}\\omega_{\\mu\\nu}\\omega^{\\mu\\nu}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2 } m_v^2 v_{\\mu } v^{\\mu } -\\frac{1}{4}{\\boldsymbol b}_{\\mu\\nu}\\cdot { \\boldsymbol b}^{\\mu\\nu}+\\frac{1}{2 } m_\\rho^2 { \\boldsymbol b}_{\\mu}\\cdot { \\boldsymbol b}^{\\mu } \\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\frac{1}{4}f_{\\mu\\nu } f^{\\mu\\nu } + \\bar \\psi_e\\left[\\gamma_\\mu\\left(i\\partial^{\\mu } + e a^{\\mu}\\right ) -m_e\\right]\\psi_e \\,\\label{lagtw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3    the parameters of the model are : the nucleon mass @xmath4 , the electron mass @xmath5 , the masses of the mesons @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath9 and the density - dependent coupling parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which are adjusted in order to reproduce some of the nuclear matter bulk properties , using the following parametrization : @xmath13 with @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16\\ , .",
    "\\label{paratw2}\\ ] ] in the sequel we will present results obtained with tw and dd - me2 .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 are given in table [ ddpar ] .",
    ".parameters of the density - dependent models . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this effect may have important consequences in stellar matter .",
    "in fact , in a supernovae explosion 99% of the energy is carried away by the neutrinos .",
    "neutrinos interact strongly with neutrons ( large weak vector charge of the neutron ) and therefore the way neutrons clusterize is important to determine the neutrino mean free path .",
    "neutrinos may couple strongly to the neutron - rich matter low - energy modes present in this explosive environment and revive the stalled supernovae shock .",
    "the system is driven to the non - homogeneous phase by the mode with a larger growth - rate . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we plot the growth - rate of the most unstable mode as a function of density for np matter without coulomb interaction and npe matter .",
    "the wavelength associated with these modes is related to the size of the inhomogeneities formed . in fig . [ fig4]b ) half of the wavelength , which corresponds to the size of the clusters formed , is plotted as a function of density for the proton fractions and models considered in fig . [ fig4]a ) . as expected , in all the cases the presence of electrons reduces the growth - rate and the size of the clusters ; this effect is more pronounced for larger densities .    for very small densities ( @xmath24 )",
    "all three models have a similar behavior , characterized by a large growth - rate . as density increases ,",
    "all the curves have similar slopes , but considerable differences between the models arise",
    ". for symmetric matter tw behaves like nl3 with the largest values for the growth rate and the size of the associated clusters .",
    "as asymmetry increases tw still maintains the largest instability , but nl3 changes its behavior becoming closer to dd - me2 with the smallest growth - rate .",
    "the size of the instabilities that drive the system is of the order of @xmath25 fm . for small @xmath26 the unstable mode disappears due to the quenching of the instability : @xmath27 divergence of the coulomb energy . in the large @xmath26 limit the effect of the coulomb interaction goes to zero .",
    "larger differences between nl3 , tw and dd - me2 occur at densities and proton fraction of interest for @xmath28-equilibrium stellar matter . in particular tw predicts larger clusters at densities above @xmath29 0.02 @xmath30 . the size of the clusters calculated agree with the results of a density functional with relativistic mean - fields coupled with the electric field @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the low densities instabilities in density - dependent relativistic hadronic models ( ddrm ) and compared them with previous results obtained within nlwm , namely with the nl3 parametrization .",
    "the spinodal region shows that both ddrm used here present instability regions larger than nl3 , except for large @xmath26 in which case dd - me2 has a smaller spinodal region .",
    "these differences occur mainly at larger isospin asymmetry . from the astrophysical point of view , this could mean differences in low density stellar matter , namely the crust properties of compact stars . in particular , we have seen that while the predicted inner crust edge density for stellar matter with trapped neutrinos is very similar in all models considered , in cold stellar matter with no neutrinos the differences are large . for ddrm",
    "this density is about @xmath31 larger than the one for nl3 .",
    "it was shown that except for the lowest values of density , density - dependent parametrizations predict lower distillation effects . at low densities",
    "this trend is no more true with ddrm showing results which are similar to nl3 or even slightly larger for small proton fractions .    for small @xmath26",
    "an anti - distillation effect is present in npe matter and np matter with coulomb interaction .",
    "it is for the nl3 parametrization that this behavior sets on at larger @xmath26 values and it is present in this model even for very large asymmetries ( see table [ kappas ] ) .",
    "this will have an important effect on the scattering of neutrinos which escape the proto - neutron star : a large neutron fraction implies a larger weak force interaction .",
    "we have predicted the formation of clusters with sizes ranging from @xmath29 4 fm to 10 fm .",
    "these limits depend on the proton fraction and larger clusters are formed in more asymmetric matter .",
    "we finally conclude that different parametrizations of ddrm have similar properties and different from other models with constant couplings .",
    "their predicitve power will depend on their ability of satisfying constraints both having astrophysical origin or laboratory measurements @xcite .",
    "neutrino opacity plays a crucial role but it is not the only mechanism of energy accounting in a supernova . the plasmon - decay into neutrino - antineutrino pairs should also be considered in neutron star evolution . in @xcite , we have studied plasmons in stellar matter within constant - coupling relativistic models .",
    "plasmons are currently being studied in ddrm , as we have shown in @xcite . there ,",
    "nuclear plasmon modes were found at zero temperature .",
    "we are also carrying out finite temperature calculations and we expect that this contribution will allow estimations of neutrino production , due to neutrino - antineutrino decay , in nuclear matter under neutron star conditions .",
