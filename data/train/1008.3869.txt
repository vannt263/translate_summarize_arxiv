    "the standard model ( sm ) of the strong and electroweak interactions has been very successful phenomenologically . however , there are reasons to believe that the sm is not a complete description of nature .",
    "it contains many arbitrary parameters with no connections , and provides no explanation for the symmetry - breaking mechanism that gives rise to the masses of gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "in addition , the existence of dark matter and dark energy are not accommodated by the sm .",
    "it also provides no explanation of the strong cp problem .",
    "consequently , there could be further particles and interactions as one probes higher energy scales .",
    "these energy scales could be the planck scale or an intermediate scale @xmath0 .",
    "a complete description of any new physics beyond the sm requires a fundamental theory .",
    "there are many models proposed for new physics .",
    "for example , the new particles could be those of supersymmetric theories or fermions that transform under different representations of the sm gauge group .",
    "the new interactions may also originate from quark substructure or preon exchange .",
    "because of the diversity of these models , it is useful to introduce a model - independent approach .",
    "if the physics beyond the sm lies at an energy scale @xmath0 less than 1 tev , then we should be able to observe it directly at high - energy colliders .",
    "if it lies at a scale much greater than 1 tev , then we can parameterize its effects via higher - dimension operators , suppressed by inverse powers of the scale @xmath0 .",
    "if the new physics is too heavy to appear directly in low energy processes , then we can integrate it out from the lagrangian . in this way , the effective lagrangian is : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the sm lagrangian of dimension four , @xmath3 is the new interaction of dimension five , @xmath4 is of dimension six , etc .",
    "the procedure is quite general and independent of the new interactions at scale @xmath0 .",
    "the only constraint is that all @xmath5 are @xmath6 invariant .    at dimension five ,",
    "the only operator allowed by gauge invariance is @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the lepton doublet field of the @xmath9 generation and @xmath10 is the higgs doublet field .",
    "when the higgs doublet acquires a vacuum - expectation value , this term gives rise to a majorana mass for neutrinos .",
    "due to the tiny neutrino masses , the scale @xmath0 is probably around @xmath11 gev .",
    "in contrast to this unique dimension - five operator , there are many independent dimension - six operators @xcite .    because the top quark is heavy relative to all the other observed sm fermions",
    ", we expect that the new physics at higher energy scales may reveal itself at lower energies through the effective interactions of the top quark , and deviations with respect to the sm predictions might be detectable .",
    "in this paper we will study the effect of these dimension - six operators on top quark interactions at hadron colliders .",
    "we focus on three different processes : top quark decay , single top production , and top pair production .",
    "if no deviation is observed experimentally , then one can place bounds on the coefficients of the dimension - six operators .",
    "the effects of non - standard interactions on top - quark physics at linear colliders and photon colliders can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we choose the effective lagrangian to realize the weak symmetry linearly , as the precision electroweak data favors a light higgs boson .",
    "the situation where the weak symmetry is realized nonlinearly is studied in ref .",
    "we will use the operator set introduced by buchmuller and wyler @xcite . in their paper they categorize all possible gauge - invariant dimension - six operators , and use the equations of motion ( eom ) to simplify them into 80 independent operators ( for one generation ) .",
    "subsequently it was found that several of these operators are actually not independent @xcite .",
    "we focus on the operators that have an influence on the top quark .",
    "we expect the leading modification to sm processes at order @xmath12 . in this paper",
    "we do nt consider higher order contributions .",
    "we expect the scale @xmath0 to be large ( at least larger than the scale we can probe directly ) so @xmath13 contributions would be small compared to the uncertainty on top quark measurements .",
    "thus we ignore all dimension - eight ( and higher ) operators , as well as effects involving two dimension - six operators .    for any physical observable ,",
    "the @xmath12 contribution comes from the interference between dimension - six operators and the sm lagrangian .",
    "this contribution might be suppressed for a variety reasons .",
    "for example , since all quark and lepton masses are negligible compared to the top quark mass , a new interaction that involves a right - handed quark or lepton ( except for the top quark ) has a very small interference with the sm charged - current weak interactions , which only involve left - handed fermions .",
    "it turns out that although there are a large number of dimension - six operators , only a few of them have significant effects at order @xmath12 .",
    "we list these operators in tables 1 and 2 .",
    ".cp - even operators that have effects on top - quark processes at order @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 is the left - handed quark doublet , while @xmath16 is the right - handed top quark .",
    "the field @xmath10 ( @xmath17 ) is the higgs boson doublet .",
    "@xmath18 is the covariant derivative .",
    "@xmath19 is the @xmath20 boson field strength , and @xmath21 is the gluon field strength . because of the hermiticity of the lagrangian , the coefficients of these operators are real , except for @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the operator @xmath24 with an imaginary coefficient can be removed using the eom . [",
    "cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table 1 , only one of the four - quark operators , @xmath25 , is listed explicitly . here",
    "the superscripts @xmath26 denote the first two quark generations , while @xmath15 without superscript denotes the third generation . in single top production , this is the only ( independent ) four - quark operator that contributes .",
    "however , there are many other four - quark operators with different isospin and color structures @xcite . in the top pair production process @xmath27",
    ", seven such operators contribute .",
    "the details are discussed in section 4 .    in table 2 ,",
    "the cp - odd operators are listed .",
    "these interactions interfere with the sm only if the spin of the top quark is taken into account .",
    "the reason is that the sm conserves cp to a good approximation ( the only cp violation is in the ckm matrix ) , and the inteference between a cp - odd operator and a cp - even operator is a cp violation effect .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that , in the absence of final - state interactions , any cp violation observable can assume non - zero value only if it is @xmath28-odd , where @xmath28 is the `` naive '' time reversal , which means to apply time reversal without interchanging the initial and final states .",
    "thus an observable is @xmath28-odd if it is proportional to a term of the form @xmath29 .",
    "if we do nt consider the top quark spin , @xmath30 must be the momentum of the particles , and such a term will not be present because the reactions we consider here involve at most three independent momenta . therefore top polarimetry is essential for the study of cp violation .",
    "since the top quark rapidly undergoes two - body weak decay @xmath31 with a time much shorter than the time scale necessary to depolarize the spin , information on the top spin can be obtained from its decay products .",
    "cp violation will be discussed in section 5 .",
    "there is an argument that can be used to neglect some of the new operators @xcite .",
    "some new operators can be generated at tree level from an underlying gauge theory , while others must be generated at loop order .",
    "in general the loop generated operators are suppressed by a factor of @xmath32 . however , the underlying theory may not be a weakly coupled gauge theory , or the loop diagrams could be enhanced due to the index of a fermion in a large representation .",
    "furthermore , the underlying theory may not be a gauge theory at all .",
    "fortunately , the effective field theory approach does not depend on the underlying theory .",
    "we will consider all dimension - six operators , without making any assumptions about the nature of the underlying theory .",
    "we do not make any assumptions about the flavor structure of the dimension - six operators , although we do nt consider any flavor - changing neutral currents in this paper .",
    "the charged - current weak interaction of the top quark is proportional to @xmath33 , so the sm rate for top decay and single top production is proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "we write all dimension - six operators in terms of mass - eigenstate fields , so no diagonalization of the new interactions is necessary . hence ,",
    "in charged - current weak interactions , the interference between the sm amplitude and the new interaction is proportional to @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the ( real ) coefficient of the dimension - six hermitian operator @xmath37 ( also recall that @xmath33 itself is purely real in the standard parameterization @xcite ) .",
    "if the operator is not hermitian , the coefficient @xmath36 is complex ; cp - conserving processes are proportional to @xmath38 , while cp - violating processes are instead proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "deviations of top - quark processes from sm predictions have often been discussed using a vertex - function approach , where the @xmath40 vertex is parameterized in terms of four unknown form factors @xcite .",
    "given our precision knowledge of the electroweak interaction , this approach is too crude .",
    "the effective field theory approach is well motivated ; it takes into consideration the unbroken @xmath41 gauge symmetry ; it includes contact interactions as well as vertex corrections ; it is valid for both on - shell and off - shell quarks ; and it can be used for loop processes @xcite .",
    "none of these virtues are shared by the vertex function approach @xcite .",
    "when the fermion masses ( except for the top quark ) are ignored , there are only two independent dimension - six operators in @xcite that contribute to top - quark decay at leading order : listed in ref .",
    "@xcite can be removed using the eom @xcite . ]",

    "breaking , they generate the following terms in the lagrangian : @xmath43 where @xmath44 gev is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath10 .",
    "the operator @xmath24 simply leads to a rescaling of the sm @xmath40 vertex by a factor of @xmath45 , so it does not affect any distributions , and is therefore impossible to detect in angular distributions of top - quark decays .",

    "the curves are normalized to have equal areas .",
    "the contribution from @xmath24 is the same as the sm contribution , because @xmath24 simply rescales the sm @xmath40 vertex .",

    "these results are shown in figure [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "again the curves are normalized so that the areas are the same .",
    "compared to figure [ fig2 ] , the two curves are more distinct , which implies the effect of @xmath22 would be more apparent in the energy distribution of the leptons .",
    "the angular distribution and the energy distribution are not independent .",
    "the energy of the leptons are fixed in the @xmath20 rest frame .",
    "therefore their energy in the top quark rest frame is given by a boost , which only depends on the angle @xmath52 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the energy and momentum of the @xmath20 boson in the top quark rest frame .",
    "furthermore , both the angular distribution and energy distribution can be expressed using the @xmath20 helicity fractions @xcite : @xmath62 and @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 , @xmath66 are the @xmath20 boson helicity fractions , corresponding to positive ( r ) , negative ( l ) , or zero ( 0 ) helicity .",
    "the helicity fraction is affected by the operator @xmath22 : @xmath67 these equations make manifest the earlier observation that the operator @xmath24 , which simply rescales the sm vertex , can not affect any distributions .",
    "thus top - quark decay is sensitive only to the operator @xmath22 , and can be used to measure ( or bound ) its coefficient .            finally , we investigate the polarized differential decay rate . in the rest frame of the top quark ,",
    "the angular distribution of any top quark decay product is given by @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the angle between the spin axis of the top quark and the momentum of the bottom quark , neutrino or positron .",
    "the `` analyzing power '' @xmath70 measures the degree to which the direction of the decay product @xmath71 is correlated with the top spin .",
    "if dimension - six operators are added , the relation still holds , but the coefficient @xmath70 will be affected by the new operators . since @xmath24 is just a rescaling of the sm interaction , the only correction is from @xmath22 .",
    "this could be an independent way to determine the coefficient @xmath72 . at leading order ,",

    "better understanding of this rare phenomenon can lead to new physics which may explain both the origin of mass and the preponderance of matter over anti - matter in the present universe .",
    "the sm predicts that cp - violating effects in top physics are very small .",
    "this is primarily due to the fact that its large mass renders the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani ( gim ) @xcite cancellation particularly effective @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of cp - violation effects in top physics is important because any observation of such effects would be a clear evidence of physics beyond the sm .",
    "effective field theory is a complete and model - independent approach to physics beyond the sm .",
    "its cp - odd operators can be used to describe the cp - violation effects in top quark physics .",
    "we find that there are four cp - odd operators that can have significant contribution to top quark production and decay processes , as listed in table 2 . in this section",

    "the momenta of the four particles , @xmath16,@xmath114,@xmath163 and @xmath164 are not independent because of the energy - momentum conservation . however , if we define the top quark spin vector ( in the top rest frame ) : @xmath165 where the unit vector @xmath166 is the direction of the top quark spin , then a term proportional to @xmath167 is @xmath28-odd .",
    "thus it becomes possible to observe cp violation effects .    in the top quark decay process",
    ", there is only one operator that contributes at leading order : @xmath168 this operator is cp - odd if its coefficient is imaginary .    to investigate the effect of @xmath22 , we choose the coordinate axes in the top rest frame such that the positron momentum is in the @xmath169-direction , and the bottom momentum is in the @xmath170 plane , with a positive @xmath171 component .",
    "the top quark spin is @xmath172 .",

    "we now define the following triple - product and evaluate it in the top rest frame : @xmath175 which corresponds to the projection of the top spin onto the direction perpendicular to the plane formed by the bottom quark and the positron .",
    "this leads to an asymmetry : @xmath176 such an asymmetry is a sign of cp violation . to observe such an asymmetry requires a source of polarized top quarks .",

    "a natural choice of the cp - odd observable is the triple - product considered in single top production .",
    "one could define similar quantities such as @xmath206 however this quantity does nt result in any asymmetry , because the three cp - odd operators are p - odd but c - even . for both @xmath128 and @xmath27 channels , under @xmath207 symmetry the initial and final state do not change , except that the spins of @xmath16 and @xmath139 are flipped .",

    "we have considered the effects of dimension - six operators in top quark physics .",
    "the analysis is linear in the coefficients of these operators , therefore the deviation from the sm is the interference terms between the sm and the new operators . in general , integrating out heavy particles leads not to just one but to several operators whose coefficients are related .",
    "therefore it is necessary to consider all dimension - six operators simultaneously .",
    "fortunately , although the total number of these operators is large , we found that there are only 15 operators that can have significant interference terms .",
    "in addition , for each decay or production process , only a few of them will contribute .",
    "this is one of the advantages of the effective field theory approach : although we do nt have any knowledge of the new physics beyond the sm , by making use of power counting and symmetries , the number of parameters required to describe the new physics can be largely reduced .",
    "we have obtained the deviation from the sm caused by these operators .",
    "this allows us to constrain the new physics in a systematic way .",
    "for example , we can measure ( or put bounds on ) the operator @xmath22 by measuring the @xmath20 boson helicity fraction @xmath228 and the analyzing power @xmath229 , and then use the @xmath77- and @xmath16-channel single top production to put bounds on @xmath24 and @xmath84 .",
    "the operator @xmath23 can be constrained from the @xmath78 associated production and the gluon channel @xmath161 production , while the latter process also constrains @xmath230 and @xmath124 .",

    "the cp - violation effects in top quark physics are of particular interest .",
