    "some of the most challenging and exciting problems in modern solid state physics are related to the nature of symmetry - broken states and the competition between different types of order in insulating and doped antiferromagnets .",
    "@xcite there exist numerous materials , ranging from the high - temperature superconductors to molecular - based magnets , that provide continuous source of inspiration for this research .",
    "in this paper we study the types of order that can occur in quantum spin systems on lattices formed by coupled tetrahedra .",
    "perhaps the most well - known ( and still not fully understood ) model of this type is the 3d pyrochlore lattice , composed of corner - sharing tetrahedra .",
    "@xcite the purpose of this work however is to look at a class of models where the tetrahedra are connected weakly and in a more regular fashion , almost in a 2d square lattice - like arrangement .",
    "there are two main reasons for this .",
    "first , such models allow for more reliable and complete theoretical treatment .",
    "second , we have had in mind potential applications to the @xmath0 material cu@xmath1te@xmath1o@xmath2br@xmath1 @xcite which is representative of such a geometry . rather unusually , in this material it has been observed that low - energy singlet excitations ( measured in raman spectroscopy ) coexist with some kind of ( possibly weak ) magnetic order , the origin of which is still controversial .",
    "@xcite    we suggest that to understand the properties of the above and similar systems , it is important to take into account antisymmetric , dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) spin - spin interactions , which are expected to be present in a tetrahedron on symmetry grounds .",
    "our main result , which is quite general and model dependent only in the details , is that under certain conditions the low - energy singlet dynamics can coexist with weak antiferromagnetism , induced by the dm interactions .",
    "it is well known that weak magnetic moments can appear near a magnetic - paramagnetic transition boundary , or in dimer ( gapped ) systems in the presence of both dm interactions and external magnetic field .",
    "@xcite in the present work we describe a novel mechanism for weak antiferromagnetic order , which is induced by the dm interactions even without external fields .",
    "we show below that such an exotic possibility exists in tetrahedral systems due to the degeneracy of the ground state on a single tetrahedron .",
    "the typical excitation signatures are different from those of conventional spin waves and various nontrivial effects in an external magnetic field , such as magnetic field induced order , are also present .",
    "we start with the following spin-1/2 hamiltonian , which involves both heisenberg and antisymmetric exchanges : @xmath3 where the couplings @xmath4 are distributed as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) .",
    "the tetrahedra are represented as plaquettes in fig .",
    "1(a ) , and are assumed to be coupled weakly , i.e. @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the exchange inside one tetrahedron .",
    "all couplings are antiferromagnetic .",
    "we analyze the model in two dimensions but the inclusion of three - dimensional couplings is straightforward and does not affect our main results . for simplicity of analysis and notation",
    "we set for now @xmath7 , and the effect of @xmath8 on our results will be discussed later .",
    "the dm couplings have relativistic origin , @xcite and are expected to be weak , usually at most several percent of the heisenberg exchange , @xmath9 .",
    "the distribution of the couplings @xmath10 is very lattice - specific , as the presence of the dm interaction on a particular bond is determined by the symmetry of the environment .",
    "we will make the assumption that the @xmath10 s are present only on the tetrahedra ( where the heisenberg exchange is also dominant ) , and are non - zero on every bond within one tetrahedron .",
    "the distribution of the six vectors @xmath10 , written with respect to the principal axes of the cube in fig.1(a ) , and consistent with the tetrahedral group is : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 is the magnitude of the dm vectors .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we derive the effective hamiltonian in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "the quantum phases of the model are then analyzed in sections iii and iv .",
    "section v contains our conclusions .",
    "first , we describe the states of one tetrahedron , fig",
    ".  1(a ) . for @xmath18 the ground state",
    "is twofold degenerate ( with energy @xmath19 ) and is in the singlet sector @xmath20 .",
    "the two ground states are : @xmath21[3,4]+[2,3][4,1]\\}$ ] , @xmath22[3,4]-[2,3][4,1]\\}$ ] , where @xmath23 $ ] denotes a singlet formed by the nearest - neighbor spins @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the dm interactions break the continuous spin rotational invariance , leading to an admixture of triplets to the ground state .",
    "@xcite introducing the three excited ( energy @xmath26 ) @xmath27 triplet states @xmath28 , @xmath29 , in the notation of ref .  , we obtain the two new ground states , in the limit @xmath30 : @xmath31 \\label{wave }   \\\\    \\frac{id}{2\\sqrt{2}j}\\left[|p_x\\rangle + |p_y\\rangle + |q_x\\rangle   -|q_y\\rangle \\right ] + i\\frac{d}{j } |t_z\\rangle .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these states remain degenerate with @xmath32 , and their wave - functions transform according to the @xmath33 irreducible representation of the tetrahedral point group .",
    "the diagonal matrix elements of on - site spins between the modified ground states ( [ wave ] ) are zero , whereas the off - diagonal matrix elements acquire finite _ imaginary _ values @xmath34 .",
    "the low - energy sector of the hilbert space has dimensionality @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the number of spin tetrahedra .",
    "the remaining degeneracy is lifted by the inter - tetrahedral couplings , and we proceed to analyze the nature of the new ground state . for this purpose",
    "we introduce a pseudo - spin @xmath37 representation , so that @xmath38 corresponds to @xmath39 and @xmath40 corresponds to @xmath41 .",
    "we then obtain the effective hamiltonian in the ground state subspace : @xmath42 - h   \\sum_{\\bf i } t_{z,{\\bf i } }    \\label{pseudoham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now the site indexes @xmath43 refer to the positions of the tetrahedra , and the summation is over nearest neighbors on a square lattice .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath44 the couplings in the different pseudospin directions are explicitly : @xmath45 the mixed coupling depends on the bond direction @xmath46        the effective hamiltonian describes an anisotropic ferromagnet in an effective magnetic field @xmath47 applied along the `` hard '' @xmath48-axis .",
    "if the field @xmath47 does not exceed a critical value @xmath49 ( which we find to be the physical case , corresponding to ( [ couplings ] ) ) , the system breaks the ising symmetry along the soft @xmath50 or @xmath51 axes .",
    "the selected direction in the @xmath52-plane depends on @xmath53 .",
    "the first - order transition line @xmath54 , on mean - field level , separates regions with @xmath55 ( for @xmath56 ) , and @xmath57 ( for @xmath58 ) .",
    "the two regions are shown in fig .  2 as a function of the microscopic parameters . since @xmath59 , throughout the phase diagram @xmath60 .",
    "we now discuss in more detail the nature of symmetry breaking in the two phases .    .",
    "( b ) magnetic moments in an external magnetic field along the 1 - 3 bond in the dimer phase from ( a ) ( tilt of spins in the field direction not shown ) .",
    "( c ) spin arrangement in the phase @xmath61 , at zero field . ]",
    "the phase with @xmath62 corresponds to dimer order .",
    "the existence of such a phase for the case @xmath18 was pointed out in ref .  .",
    "physically , this means that the ground state of the system is the linear combination @xmath63 , on every site , which is equivalent to @xmath64 ( these values correspond to ( [ couplings ] ) ) .",
    "the ground state is a real combination of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and therefore the expectation values of local spins vanish , and only dimer order is present in this case , as shown in fig .",
    "since the @xmath67 coupling in ( [ pseudoham ] ) has ferromagnetic sign , the dimer pattern repeats itself on all tetrahedra .",
    "magneto - elastic couplings could also contribute to the dimerization tendency as discussed for the pyrochlore case , @xcite but in our scenario dimerization occurs spontaneously and is due to purely heisenberg exchanges .",
    "the dimer ordered state breaks the discrete , ising symmetry @xmath68 of ( [ pseudoham ] ) , and thus the excitation spectrum @xmath69 has a gap @xmath70 ( for @xmath18 ) . at finite temperature @xmath71 ,",
    "the ordered state exists below the critical temperature @xmath72 .",
    "we have used the linear spin wave expansion and the mean - field equations to calculate these quantities .",
    "( solid lines ) on magnetic field ( applied as in fig .",
    "3(b ) ) at the points a and b of fig.2 .",
    "two upper curves shifted by 0.05 for clarity .",
    "inset : magnetic moment @xmath73 in magnetic field in the z direction for a single tetrahedron ( results identical in x , y directions ) . for @xmath18 , @xmath74 . ]    due to the presence of triplets in the ground state ( [ dmsinglets ] ) , a ( real ) external uniform magnetic field @xmath75 also leads to non - trivial effects . on a single tetrahedron ( @xmath76 ) the field produces a finite magnetization in the field direction , shown in the inset of fig .  4 .",
    "for small fields @xmath77 , the contribution is linear and proportional to : @xmath78 .",
    "we find that the magnetization is only weakly dependent on the field direction .",
    "for @xmath79 , the corrections to the effective hamiltonian ( [ pseudoham ] ) have to be derived , and we find them to be strongly dependent on the field direction .",
    "for example for a weak field in the x - y direction @xmath80 ,",
    "( [ dmsinglets ] ) changes to : @xmath81 .",
    "\\nonumber \\label{fieldsinglets}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the energy difference between these states leads to a modification of the `` effective field '' @xmath82 in eq.([pseudoham ] ) . even though several additional terms are generated in @xmath83",
    ", for @xmath84 the above effect is dominant .",
    "we have recalculated the gap @xmath85 and the critical temperature @xmath86 in the presence of the field and the results are summarized in fig .  4 , where we have plotted these quantities relative to their zero field values .",
    "the gap generally shows a stronger field dependence .",
    "we note that the increase as a function of field is not universal , and in fact if a field is applied in the z direction @xmath87 , then @xmath85 and @xmath86 would decrease at almost the same rate .",
    "an applied magnetic field also generates staggered antiferromagnetic moments in the plane perpendicular to the field . the corresponding pattern is shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) , where @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and the spins on sites @xmath90 and @xmath91 point along the diagonals of the cube ( towards and out of the cube s center , respectively ) .",
    "the value of the magnetic moments in this pattern , repeated on all tetrahedra , is @xmath92 field induced antiferromagnetic ordering is a general feature of singlet systems with dm interactions .",
    "the phase with @xmath93 in fig .  2 corresponds to a ground state which is a complex linear combination on a single tetrahedron @xmath94 , where @xmath95 are real coefficients .",
    "this combination is ferromagnetically repeated on every tetrahedron .",
    "depending on the values of the microscopic parameters , @xmath96 .",
    "the resulting state resembles to a large extent a spin - liquid state with a broken time - reversal symmetry proposed some time ago @xcite and characterized by finite scalar chirality @xmath97 . in our case",
    "such a state appears , however , due to the anisotropic dm interaction in a system without spin - rotational invariance , and we have @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , a broken time - reversal symmetry immediately induces finite antiferromagnetic moments with magnitude : @xmath99 the spins are at an angle @xmath100 with respects to each other , and form a four - sublattice antiferromagnetic structure , as shown in fig .",
    "3(c ) . on each tetrahedron the total magnetic moment @xmath101",
    ".    similarly to the dimer phase , the broken ising symmetry leads to an excitation gap and a finite ising transition temperature , whose values , for dominant dm interactions are respectively @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "thus , we find a quite unusual situation : the specific heat exhibits a large anomaly at the transition temperature , where a macroscopic part of the low - temperature entropy @xmath104 freezes out .",
    "however , if looked at in neutron experiments such a transition is characterized by development of small antiferromagnetic moments below @xmath105 .",
    "this exotic behavior is due to the fact that the transition itself is driven by low - energy singlet degrees of freedom . in applied magnetic field @xmath80 , the gap and @xmath105 in the broken time - reversal symmetry state scale as shown in fig .  4 , upper set of curves .",
    "we find that generally the field dependence is stronger than in the dimer phase , which is mainly due to the presence of the dm scale @xmath17 in the two observables without a field .",
    "we note that @xmath106 depends linearly on @xmath107 while @xmath67 is quadratic ( [ couplings ] ) .",
    "thus , even though the @xmath108 ( magnetic ) and the @xmath109 ( dimer ) orders compete with each other , at sufficiently small @xmath107 the @xmath108 order is expected to dominate ( although only in asymptotic sense for the present model ) .",
    "the tendency towards @xmath108 order is further enhanced by the presence of @xmath110 ( see fig .",
    "this coupling frustrates the @xmath109 component while strengthening @xmath108 , which results in a shift of the phase boundary in fig .  2 downwards .",
    "if we also consider a situation when @xmath8 is the dominant inter - tetrahedral exchange , @xmath111 , and set @xmath76 , then we find that @xmath109 couplings are generated only in fourth order , @xmath112 .",
    "this again means that the @xmath108 order can occur under much easier conditions .",
    "nonetheless , only on lattices that have the tendency to produce true spin liquid ground states do we expect the @xmath108 order to occur spontaneously .",
    "good candidates appear to be the pyrochlore lattice @xcite as well as the kagom lattice .",
    "@xcite dm induced ordering has been discussed in the latter case from quasiclassical perspective .",
    "our calculations have been performed for ideal tetrahedra while weak distortions ( such as asymmetry in the heisenberg exchanges , or deviations of the dm vectors from the tetrahedral symmetry ) would introduce a small gap on a single tetrahedron . however , as long as @xmath113 are sufficiently large , relative to this gap , the basic characteristics of the phases described above will remain unchanged .",
    "the dm order may deviate from fig .",
    "3(c ) , while preserving the property @xmath101 .",
    "the physics described in the present work occurs on the small energy scales @xmath114 , while upon increasing the inter - tetrahedral couplings to @xmath115 , a transition to a more conventional nel phase is expected to take place .",
    "@xcite the exotic phases we have found are certainly stable as long as the system is sufficiently far from the nel order , i.e. the triplet gap is non - zero and all the relevant dynamics is governed by the singlet sector ( or the mixed states eq .",
    "( 2 ) in the presence of dm interactions ) , and therefore can be described by the effective hamiltonian eq .",
    "we have made sure that this condition is fulfilled by using the weak - coupling analysis , although our results are expected to be qualitatively valid also for moderately large @xmath116 subject , as already mentioned , to the condition that the triplet gap is sizable enough .",
    "thus , on general grounds we expect a transition as a function of @xmath107 or @xmath117 between phases with exotic ( weak magnetic ) order , discussed in this work , and the nel ordered state , although the exact determination of the transition boundary is a difficult problem and has not been the subject of this work .",
    "instead , we have concentrated on the `` universal '' properties of the dm induced exotic phases which are clearly present in the weak - coupling limit and accurately described by a hamiltonian of the form eq .",
    "the states we have found at low energies have quite unusual characteristics , which we will now summarize .",
    "( i ) due to the presence of the dm interactions the spin - rotational invariance is broken and the ground state develops a small magnetic moment in a field , with the uniform magnetization showing a characteristic linear behavior in weak magnetic fields ( fig .",
    "4(inset ) ) .",
    "( ii ) either dimerized or 4-sublattice , weakly antiferromagnetic states emerge as the ground state of the system .",
    "both exhibit gaps in the spectrum since only ising symmetries are broken .",
    "( iii ) the dominant components in the wave functions eq.([dmsinglets ] ) are singlets , thus a large spectral weight s=0 transitions at low energy ( equal to the gap @xmath118 ) are present in the raman spectrum .",
    "( iv ) both the gap and @xmath119 depend on magnetic field with a strong directional dependence .",
    "( v ) the dominant s=1 excitation has a large gap of order @xmath120 .",
    "we now comment on possible applications of our theory to cu@xmath1te@xmath1o@xmath2br@xmath1 .",
    "the properties of this material are indeed consistent with signatures ( i - iv ) above , in particular the compound exhibits : @xcite ( a. ) a weak magnetization in a field , ( b. ) a sharp zero - field , low - energy raman peak ( `` singlet gap '' @xmath121 ) , disappearing at @xmath122 , ( c. ) a magnetic field dependence ( increase ) of both @xmath123 and @xmath119 . experimentally the most important unanswered question remains whether the ground state below @xmath119 is magnetically ordered or not , with recent nmr experiments pointing to some kind of magnetic order .",
    "@xcite this would suggest , in our scenario , that the ground state is of the type shown in fig .",
    ". the crucial test for our ideas , and thus our prediction , would be the observation of a large triplet gap ( larger than the `` singlet gap '' of 24k ) in the neutron spectrum ( point ( v ) above ) .",
    "the microscopic values of the exchanges are still rather controversial @xcite and consequently we have not attempted detailed fits but have used , phenomenologically , the model of fig .  1 .",
    "we emphasize that in our model a weak magnetic moment is a generic feature of the @xmath61 phase ( and the dimer phase in magnetic field ) , and does not require a fine - tuning of parameters to achieve proximity to a magnetic - paramagnetic boundary , as in the purely heisenberg case .",
    "@xcite    finally , on purely fundamental level , we have found an unconventional mechanism for _ weak antiferromagnetism_. our results are to be contrasted with the usual effect the dm interaction produces , @xcite namely weak ferromagnetism in an otherwise antiferromagnetic system . in the present work we have shown how weak antiferromagnetic order can emerge from a singlet background .",
