    "much of the sky is covered with neutral hydrogen clouds whose velocities , though within several hundreds of km s@xmath5 of zero , are nonetheless anomalous and can not be explained by normal rotation of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "it is attractive to consider that these high - velocity hi clouds ( hvcs ) might be material left over from the formation of the milky way , now in the process of being accreted @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , other galaxies may be expected to have similar gaseous components .",
    "a key advantage of studying such extragalactic clouds is that their distance can be comparatively well - constrained . in practice , it has proven difficult to achieve the combination of high spatial resolution , mass sensitivity , and large field - of - view necessary to detect hvc analogs in external systems .",
    "many nearby galaxies have a few peculiar features with mass as low as @xmath4 10@xmath2  m@xmath3 ( eg .",
    "ngc  628 , @xcite ) , but only recently have instruments had sufficient sensitivity to begin revealing complete systems of peculiar velocity ( eg . the slowly rotating `` halo '' component of ngc  2403 , @xcite ) . in this letter , we report on deep , wide - field observations conducted with the green bank telescope ( gbt ) which have resulted in the detection of a complex system of gas extending to at least 50  kpc radius around m31 .",
    "the gbt observations were obtained over six nights during september 2002 .",
    "the telescope was scanned over a @xmath6 region around m31 while spectra were measured over a heliocentric velocity range between @xmath7 km  s@xmath5  and + 226 km  s@xmath5  at a velocity resolution of 1.25 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "at m31 s distance of 770 kpc @xcite , the gbt beam ( 9.1@xmath8 fwhm ) projects to 2.0 kpc and our survey covers a @xmath9  kpc@xmath10 region . at a resolution of 3 kpc and 18 km",
    "s@xmath5 the acheived rms flux sensitivity was 7.2 mjy beam@xmath5 corresponding to an column density of @xmath11  @xmath12 in a single channel averaged over the beam .",
    "our gbt data show many clouds surrounding m31 at @xmath13 km  s@xmath5 , which can be compared to the systemic velocity of @xmath14 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "emission features were identified as discrete sources if they were distinct from the m31 disk ( which extends over the velocity interval @xmath15 to @xmath16 km  s@xmath5 ) , were unconfused with the galaxy , and were characterized by a peak flux density @xmath17 .",
    "additional gbt spectra were obtained for the faintest detections to verify the accuracy of our procedures .",
    "we limited the investigation to velocities more negative than @xmath18 km  s@xmath5  in order to exclude contamination from intermediate velocity galactic emission .",
    "our @xmath19 cm observations have revealed a population of about twenty discrete clouds together with an extended , filamentary `` halo '' component .",
    "the data show that these features can not be instrumental effects related to m31 s bright disk , for there is no relationship between the diffuse structures and the brightness of nearby disk gas .",
    "gbt images showing the distribution of at different velocities are presented in fig .",
    "these were taken from a heavily - smoothed variant of the data cube .",
    "contours are drawn at 2 , 4 , and 6@xmath20 .",
    "discrete compact clouds appear at velocities between @xmath21 and @xmath22 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "extended regions of filamentary , low n@xmath23 gas are found preferentially within @xmath24 km  s@xmath5  of m31 s systemic velocity ( @xmath25 km  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "we believe that this gas is associated with m31 , for the following reasons : ( 1 ) there is evidence for interaction between several of the clouds and m31 or its companions , ( 2 ) cloud velocities match the velocity extent of m31 s disk and generally correlate with the pattern of andromeda s outer disk rotation , ( 3 ) the extended component is concentrated near m31 s systemic velocity , ( 4 ) confusion with the foreground magellanic stream at this location is unlikely , and ( 5 ) dynamical constraints on the mass of m31 , assuming a bound cloud population , are in good agreement with independently determined values .",
    "we first examine this evidence linking the detections to m31 , then consider possible origins for the cloud population .",
    "figure 2 depicts the high velocity gas in the survey field which could be cleanly separated from the disk emission of andromeda .",
    "contours of integrated column density at 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 and @xmath26  @xmath12 ( evaluated using the smoothed cube shown in fig . 1 ) are overlaid on an optical image of m31 .",
    "star symbols mark discrete clouds meeting our 5@xmath20 significance threshold which are adequately resolved from neighbors in position - velocity space .",
    "one discrete cloud near the north edge of the field peaks below the minimum contour after datacube smoothing , but has been independently confirmed in follow - up gbt observations .",
    "in addition to discrete clouds , there are extended filamentary complexes of low column density , most notably at small galactocentric radii southeast and north of andromeda s stellar disk .",
    "only structures which are cleanly separated from the m31 disk emission are included in fig .",
    "additional filaments can be discerned in fig . 1 .",
    "the collection of discrete clouds extending more than @xmath27 ( 20  kpc ) to the south of m31 s disk near ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) = ( 00:42 , 39:15 ) is suggestive of a tidal stream , based on the elongated distribution and continuously varying radial velocity of the features .",
    "these clouds are partially coextensive with the metal - rich stellar `` andromeda stream '' @xcite although they are significantly offset to the southwest .",
    "the conclusion that these particular clouds are associated with m31 seems inescapable .",
    "a second case of partial correspondence of gaseous and stellar components is the discrete object which is displaced by only 25@xmath8 to the southwest of ngc 205 and is overlapping in velocity with that galaxy .",
    "this feature also merges in position and velocity with the m31 disk .",
    "the only object in our sample that was known previously is davies cloud @xcite , which is at least 10 times brighter than the other features .",
    "davies considered that it might be part of the magellanic stream rather than m31 , but in our complimentary wide - field study of a @xmath30 region centered on m31 ( @xcite ; see also braun & thilker 2003 , in prep . )",
    "we find that the magellanic stream comes no closer than @xmath31 to the southwest , where its velocity differs by about 100 km  s@xmath5  from the diffuse components near m31 .",
    "it seems likely that davies cloud and the other detections from our survey are not confused by emission from the magellanic stream .",
    "a high resolution imaging study of davies cloud @xcite has provided additional morphological and kinematic evidence for tidal interaction with m31 .",
    "we suggest that it is simply the most massive of a population of faint clouds around the andromeda galaxy .",
    "additional evidence for association of the newly - detected clouds with m31 is that the discrete cloud velocities appear partially correlated with the pattern of outer disk rotation in m31 , with the most negative velocities occurring in the south - west and the most positive in the north - east .",
    "the high negative velocities of some clouds ( e.g. , @xmath32515 km  s@xmath5 ) are also more extreme than any seen previously in galactic hvc surveys ( @xmath33 km  s@xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "a straightforward interpretation is that the clouds are collectively under the gravitational influence of the andromeda galaxy and have interacted dissipatively with m31 in the past .",
    "if the detected clouds represent a circum - galactic population gravitationally bound to andromeda , their velocity offsets and projected separations should be collectively related to m31 s total mass . using the virial theorem and representing the discrete gbt clouds as bound test particles orbiting a central mass ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eqn 10 - 22 ) , we find that m@xmath34  m@xmath35 .",
    "this estimate reflects only the mass contained within the radii probed by our clouds .",
    "if we instead assume an extended mass distribution ( eqn 10 - 23 ) similar to the distribution of clouds , the entire virial mass of andromeda is then m@xmath36 = @xmath37  m@xmath35 .",
    "these two mass determinations are in good agreement with independent total mass estimates of @xmath38  m@xmath35 within a radius of 30 kpc @xcite and @xmath39  m@xmath35 within andromeda s virial radius of 300 kpc @xcite .    from all these considerations ,",
    "we consider it very likely that the newfound clouds reside in the circum - galactic environment of m31 .",
    "at a distance of 770 kpc , most clouds in our sample have masses in the range @xmath40  m@xmath35 .",
    "such clouds would not have been detected as discrete objects in previous surveys of more distant galaxies , which generally have probed only the mass range above @xmath41  m@xmath35 @xcite .",
    "an indication for the more general existence of low mass circum - galactic populations comes from the recent detection of a 15% excess of mass found on scales of several hundred kpc relative to that seen at tens of kpc in the environment of apparently isolated galaxies @xcite .",
    "placing accurate limits on the total hi mass of the m31 halo cloud population is difficult because we lack a well - measured radial scale length for the population , must cope with potential incompleteness due to galactic confusion , and have no confirmed minimum cloud mass . to the degree that the observed cloud mass function is consistent with a sensitivity - bounded power law given by @xmath42 ,",
    "our estimate of hi mass for the halo cloud population within the gbt field is @xmath43  m@xmath35 .",
    "the upper limit of this range is calculated assuming the true population is bounded by a minimum hi cloud mass of @xmath44  m@xmath35 and that there are fewer than @xmath45 of such objects , the vast majority of which are not yet detected .",
    "we also included an extra 25% to account for clouds confused with galactic emission , but even so , the mass of andromeda s discrete halo cloud population in our data amounts to only @xmath46 of the mass of m31 s hi disk .",
    "below , we explore the idea that the halo clouds may trace a more substantial amount of ionized gas and possibly also dark matter .",
    "an obvious source of high velocity is tidal stripping from recent or ongoing mergers .",
    "we detect a gaseous feature which is partially coextensive with the stellar andromeda stream @xcite , and of comparable spatial extent , as well as a component of possibly stripped gas adjacent to ngc  205 . however , most of the discrete clouds detected in our gbt survey are rather isolated , lacking any apparent relation to known m31 companion galaxies , and do not have obvious indications if internal tidal distortions . nevertheless , the faintest dwarf galaxies and stellar streams are notoriously hard to detect ( armandroff et al .",
    "one might argue that some dwarfs have yet to be discovered , while others have been entirely consumed by m31 . indeed , the comparatively young ( 6 - 8 gyr ) halo stars found by brown et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in the acs andromeda deep field do suggest that m31 has seen a major merger ( with a massive star forming galaxy ) or several minor mergers .",
    "cooling of a tenuous inter - galactic medium @xcite is a second viable source of clouds . in this view , halo clouds would condense from , and remain confined by , coronal gas which is located around m31 or perhaps pervades the local group .",
    "sembach et al .",
    "( 2002 ) presented evidence for an extended and highly ionized galactic corona or local group medium traced by high - velocity absorption .",
    "likewise , lockman et al .",
    "( 2002 ) conducted a sensitive hi survey of 860 sightlines at @xmath47 , which suggested that a low - column density `` mist '' of high - velocity neutral gas surrounds the milky way ( @xmath48  @xmath12 along @xmath49 of sightlines ) .",
    "together , these studies show that the galactic hvc phenomenon extends to much lower column densities than traditionally appreciated and that the classical galactic hvcs are only part of a more ubiquitous multi - phase medium .",
    "the filamentary `` halo '' we detect concentrated on the m31 systemic velocity may be a manifestation of an m31 `` cooling flow '' .",
    "in such a scenario , the detected may represent only the tip of the iceberg , in terms of baryonic mass , since the gas may well be only of order 1% neutral at the relevant low volume densities @xcite .",
    "the primary source of such coronal gas may actually be the action of a large - scale `` galactic fountain '' @xcite in the recent or distant past",
    ".    a third component of high velocity near m31 might be the gas associated with a putative population of low mass dark - matter halos .",
    "current simulations of the local group in a @xmath50cdm cosmology predict a large population of low mass dm halos at the present epoch @xcite which dramatically outnumber known dwarf galaxies .",
    "if the m31 halo clouds are tracers of substantial dark - matter concentrations , this should be reflected in their internal line - widths .",
    "we plot the observed mass versus fwhm line - width for discrete clouds in figure 3 .",
    "line - width measurements were determined using gaussian fits to cloud spectra .",
    "the line - width distribution has an approximate lower bound roughly consistent with thermal broadening for gas at 10@xmath51 k ( fwhm = 24 km  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "a systematic increase in fwhm line - width is observed with increasing mass , reaching some 70 km  s@xmath5  for the clouds near 10@xmath52  m@xmath3 .",
    "although davies cloud is significantly offset from the remainder of the distribution in fig .",
    "3 , high - resolution imaging has revealed much higher internal line - widths in that object as well @xcite . to demonstrate the expected distribution of line - width with mass , in fig .",
    "3 we show a curve corresponding to @xmath53 , where the characteristic discrete cloud radius , r , has been held constant at 500 pc , based on our interferometric wsrt detections of some of the cloud cores ( braun et al .",
    "2003 , in prep . ) .",
    "this curve , corresponding to a dark to mass ratio of about 100:1 , is not intended to fit to the data , but merely to provide a basis for comparison .",
    "the hypothesis of a kinematically dominant dark - matter component appears to be consistent with the observed line - widths of the discrete m31 halo clouds .",
    "another aspect of the dark - matter mini - halo scenario that can be checked is the expected number of such objects in the appropriate mass range in the vicinity of m31 .",
    "sternberg et al . ( 2002 ) predict @xmath54 dark matter mini - halos associated with gravitationally confined hi within a radius of 40 kpc around m31 , based on the simulations of klypin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and moore et al .",
    "this is fully consistent with the 20 discrete m31 halo clouds we have detected .",
    "the sternberg et al .",
    "calculations also suggest that circum - galactic objects of such low mass and peak column density should be only @xmath55 % neutral , implying @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "associated ionized gas could perhaps be detected via deep fabry - perot imaging @xcite or absorption line spectroscopy of background quasars @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "our gbt observations of the andromeda galaxy have revealed the first extensive extragalactic counterpart to the galactic hvc population . both discrete and diffuse components are detected .",
    "we find some supporting evidence for at least three different possible origins of the high velocity gas , namely : tidal disruption , halo condensation and association with low - mass dm halos ."
