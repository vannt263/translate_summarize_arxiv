    "monte carlo ( mc ) methods used to simulate classical spin systems , such as potts models , fall primarily into two broad classes : local - update algorithms and cluster algorithms .",
    "algorithms with local update rules , such as the metropolis algorithm , provide an efficient means of simulating these spin systems in non - critical regions . near a second - order phase transition , however , where long - range correlations are present , relaxation times increase rapidly with system size .",
    "this phenomenon , known as critical slowing down , may be characterized by a dynamic exponent @xmath10 according to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the autocorrelation time measured at criticality ( roughly , the time necessary to generate a statistically independent configuration ) and @xmath1 is the system size .",
    "local - update algorithms typically have values of @xmath10 slightly greater than 2 and , therefore , are impractical for simulating large systems near a critical point .",
    "cluster algorithms , on the other hand , such as the swendsen - wang ( sw )  @xcite algorithm , employ non - local update moves , flipping clusters of spins of linear extent comparable to the correlation length .",
    "this technique significantly reduces critical slowing down , and thus makes cluster algorithms preferable for simulating spin systems near a critical phase transition .",
    "recent numerical estimates of the sw dynamic exponent for two - dimensional ferromagnetic @xmath13-state potts models are @xmath14  @xcite for the ising ( @xmath15 ) case and @xmath16  @xcite for @xmath17 .",
    "although there currently exists no theoretical means by which the dynamic exponent of a sw - type algorithm may be calculated , there is a rigorous lower bound .",
    "the li - sokal  @xcite bound , as it has come to be known , states that @xmath18 for @xmath13-state potts models , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the usual static critical exponents for the specific heat and correlation length , respectively .",
    "we note that the numerical values given above are consistent with this bound , since , in two dimensions , @xmath21 @xmath22 for @xmath15 , and @xmath23 for @xmath17 .",
    "for the remainder of this paper we will continue to focus on the ising and 3-state potts models in two - dimensions , since these are the two most carefully studied cases .",
    "we now turn to the invaded cluster ( ic )  @xcite algorithm , a recent approach based on invasion percolation , for simulating equilibrium critical points .",
    "this algorithm has the unique property that it `` self - organizes '' to the critical point .",
    "therefore , no _ a priori _ knowledge of the critical temperature is required ; instead , @xmath24 is an output of the algorithm .",
    "in addition , due to an intrinsic negative - feedback mechanism , the ic algorithm equilibrates very quickly in the sense that thermodynamic quantities are measured to be near their equilibrium values within a few mc steps ( after starting , say , from a completely ordered state ) .",
    "initial studies  @xcite seemed to indicate that the ic algorithm suffers no critical slowing down for the ising model . for both @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the integrated autocorrelation time",
    "@xmath27 was observed to decrease with @xmath1 , while @xmath28 remained constant ( within error bars ) , where @xmath29 is the energy per spin , and @xmath30 is the fraction of spins in the largest cluster .",
    "( we omit the usual `` int '' subscript on @xmath12 , since we deal almost exclusively with integrated as opposed to exponential autocorrelation times . ) the decrease of @xmath27 with @xmath1 was also observed for @xmath31- and @xmath32-state potts models in two dimensions , but in these cases critical slowing was evident in the behavior of @xmath28 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the dynamic exponents were estimated to be @xmath33 for @xmath17 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 , each of which is less than the li - sokal bound on @xmath36 for its respective value of @xmath13 .    in this paper , we repeat these studies for @xmath15 and @xmath17 in two dimensions using larger lattice sizes and an improved method  @xcite of estimating @xmath12 .",
    "we also investigate the @xmath1-dependence of the `` specific - heat - like '' quantity @xmath37 .",
    "( in the canonical ensemble @xmath38 is the specific heat , but the same is not true for the ic ensemble . ) in addition we measure @xmath2 , the integrated autocorrelation time for the energy per spin @xmath39 measured on an @xmath3 sub - lattice of the whole @xmath40 lattice , as well as @xmath41 . while the motivations for these experiments are discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sect : crossover ] , the central idea is that we expect the negative feedback to diminish for length scales @xmath42 , leading to sub - system behavior that differs from that of the whole system .",
    "we argue in sec .",
    "[ sect : crossover ] that , for @xmath0 sufficiently less than @xmath1 , we should observe a crossover to sw behavior for observables measured on a sub - lattice of size @xmath0 . upon investigating the crossover region , we find that @xmath43 has a simple scaling form and give an estimate of the length scale at which @xmath43 crosses over to its sw analog , namely , the specific heat for an @xmath3 system .",
    "the results are less conclusive in the case of the dynamic variable @xmath2 , but it appears that crossover to sw behavior does occur and that the crossover length for @xmath2 differs from that for @xmath43 and is likely the same for @xmath15 and @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , the crossover phenomenon leads to a maximum in @xmath2 as @xmath0 is varied for a given @xmath1 .",
    "we argue in sec .",
    "[ sect : crossover ] that the dynamic exponent @xmath4 of the ic algorithm is appropriately defined by @xmath44 . for the 3-state potts model we give a numerical estimate for @xmath4 that is smaller than a recent estimate  @xcite of @xmath36 and also less than the li - sokal bound on @xmath36 . for the ising model",
    "the results are less conclusive , but it appears that @xmath7 and possibly that @xmath45 so that @xmath9similar to the state of affairs for the sw algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sect : ic ] we provide some background on the invaded cluster algorithm and discuss results of previous ic simulations . in sec .",
    "[ sect : crossover ] we discuss the crossover phenomenon in greater detail and propose a scaling form to relate observables measured on sub - lattices using the ic algorithm to corresponding quantities for the sw algorithm .",
    "we describe our ic simulations of the ising and 3-state potts models in sec .  [",
    "sect : sim ] and discuss the results in sec .",
    "[ sect : results ] .",
    "[ sect : conclusion ] contains our conclusions .",
    "[ sect : ic ]    in order to understand how the ic algorithm works , we first review the sw algorithm for potts models .",
    "the ferromagnetic @xmath13-state potts hamiltonian is @xmath46 where @xmath47 and the sum is over nearest - neighbor spin pairs .",
    "( note that the ising model is just the special case @xmath15 . )",
    "given an initial spin configuration , the sw algorithm proceeds as follows : first , satisfied bonds are occupied with probability @xmath48 , with @xmath49 , where a bond joining two spins @xmath50 and @xmath51 is defined to be _ satisfied _ if and only if @xmath52 .",
    "unsatisfied bonds are never occupied .",
    "next , clusters of spins connected by occupied bonds are identified , and each cluster is `` flipped '' , i.e. , independently and uniformly assigned a new random spin value from @xmath53 .",
    "( note that a cluster can consist of a single spin . ) finally , after statistics have been collected , occupied bonds are erased and the whole process is repeated .",
    "it can easily be shown that the sw algorithm satisfies detailed balance for the canonical ensemble .",
    "the ic algorithm uses invasion percolation to generate the spin clusters to be flipped .",
    "given an initial spin configuration , the first step is to assign a random order to the bonds of the lattice .",
    "the bonds are then examined , and satisfied bonds occupied one at a time in this order . if a bond joining two clusters is occupied , they are combined into one .",
    "cluster growth continues until some stopping condition is fulfilled . in this paper",
    ", we consider the topological spanning condition , which dictates that growth be stopped as soon as some cluster winds around the system in one of the @xmath54 directions .",
    "as soon as spanning is detected , clusters ( including the spanning cluster ) are flipped exactly as in the sw algorithm , statistics are collected , bonds erased , and the process repeated .    to understand why the ic algorithm self - organizes to the critical point , we define @xmath55 to be the ratio of the number of occupied bonds to the number of satisfied bonds when some cluster first spans the system .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that , as the system size @xmath1 approaches infinity , the distribution of @xmath55 approaches a delta function at @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the inverse critical temperature .",
    "though not a rigorous proof , the argument proceeds as follows .",
    "first , we note that @xmath58 is the threshold for percolation on the satisfied bonds of a critical spin configuration  @xcite .",
    "thus , given a spin configuration that is typical of the critical point , the fraction @xmath55 of satisfied bonds that must be occupied to achieve spanning is close to @xmath58 .",
    "second , we observe that each iteration of the ic algorithm is identical to an iteration of the sw algorithm with @xmath59 . therefore , performing an iteration of the ic algorithm on a critical spin configuration is equivalent to performing an iteration of the sw algorithm with @xmath60 , and thus the system will remain near the critical point .",
    "if , instead , the system is started in the low - temperature phase , the number of satisfied bonds will be larger than is typical of @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , a smaller fraction @xmath55 will need to be occupied to achieve spanning . in this case ,",
    "an ic iteration is equivalent to a sw iteration with @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath62 , and therefore the system is pushed toward @xmath24 from below .",
    "similarly , if the system is started in the high - temperature phase , it is pushed toward @xmath24 from above .",
    "thus , in summary , a system in a non - critical state is pushed toward criticality , while a system in a critical state remains near criticality with @xmath63 fluctuating about @xmath24 .",
    "because of this negative - feedback mechanism , the ic algorithm self - organizes to the critical point with no _ a priori _ knowledge of @xmath24 .",
    "instead , @xmath24 is obtained as an output of the algorithm , via the relation @xmath64 .",
    "for example , results of ic simulations for the @xmath65 ising model yield an estimate of @xmath66@xcite when extrapolated to @xmath67 , as compared to the exact result for an infinite system , @xmath68 .    since every configuration generated by the ic algorithm _",
    "must _ contain a spanning cluster , it is clear that the algorithm does not sample the canonical ensemble for a system of finite volume .",
    "we refer to the stationary distribution sampled by the ic algorithm as the ic ensemble .",
    "if we assume that as @xmath69 the distribution of @xmath55 approaches a delta function at @xmath58 and that the volume fraction of the spanning cluster goes to zero , local observables such as internal energy and magnetization will approach their infinite - volume critical values in this limit .",
    "simulation results  @xcite support this hypothesis .",
    "for example , results of ic simulations for the @xmath65 ising model yield an estimate for the energy per spin of @xmath70  @xcite when extrapolated to @xmath67 , as compared to the exact result for an infinite system , @xmath71 .    some finite - volume fluctuations in the ic ensemble , however , are very different from those in the canonical ensemble . for example , in the canonical ensemble the quantity @xmath37 is the specific heat which diverges as @xmath72 at the critical point  a logarithmic divergence for the ising model in two dimensions . in the ic ensemble ,",
    "however , @xmath73 is observed  @xcite to increase roughly linearly with @xmath1 for the @xmath65 ising model .",
    "these differences can be traced to fluctuations in the effective temperature ( measured by @xmath55 ) in the equilibrium state . in the next section",
    ", we will examine more closely the roles played by temperature fluctuations and the negative - feedback mechanism in determining the properties of the ic algorithm .",
    "[ sect : crossover ]    as described in the previous section , the negative - feedback mechanism , inherent in the ic algorithm , drives the system to criticality by effectively adjusting the temperature after each iteration .",
    "as previously mentioned , this mechanism leads to differences in the @xmath1-dependence of several dynamic and static quantities from that observed for the sw algorithm .",
    "now , however , we consider an @xmath74 sub - lattice within the @xmath40 lattice .",
    "since the energy of a sub - system of size @xmath75 is weakly correlated with that of the whole system , the negative feedback mechanism is less effective for the sub - system .",
    "a `` warm '' ( relative to @xmath24 ) sub - system in a `` cool '' system will be further warmed by the next ic iteration . as a result",
    ", the energy autocorrelation time for the sub - system may be longer than for the whole system .    the observation that an iteration of the ic algorithm is equivalent to an iteration of the sw algorithm with @xmath59 provides further insight into ic dynamics .",
    "in particular , if the distribution of @xmath55 approaches a delta function as @xmath76 , then any finite sub - system of an infinite system will behave exactly as it would under sw dynamics . in short , for @xmath0 sufficiently smaller than @xmath1 , the sub - system does nt `` know '' it is being updated by the ic and not the sw algorithm .",
    "thus we expect that , in the limit @xmath76 , all static and dynamic quantities measured on a sub - system of finite size @xmath0 will approach the values measured for the sw algorithm for a sub - system of the same size .",
    "it also follows that , for fixed @xmath1 , there is a crossover from sw to ic behavior at intermediate values of @xmath0 . for example ,",
    "the integrated autocorrelation time @xmath2 for the energy per spin in a sub - system of size @xmath0 should initially increase with @xmath0 as @xmath77 for @xmath75 , reach a maximum , and then decrease as @xmath0 is increased further into the range where the negative - feedback mechanism becomes significant .",
    "we can estimate the length scale at which the crossover occurs as follows . in the canonical ensemble ,",
    "the temperature uncertainty of the critical region scales with system size @xmath1 as @xmath78 . in the ic ensemble , however , temperature fluctuations are governed by the negative - feedback mechanism as described above . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that the standard deviation of @xmath55 scales as @xmath79 with @xmath80 for @xmath81 as compared with @xmath82 respectively . since the sw algorithm samples from the canonical ensemble and",
    "since we expect sw behavior for sub - systems of size @xmath75 , crossover between the ic and sw regimes should occur when the temperature uncertainties from the two sources are comparable .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath1 , we expect crossover at a sub - system size @xmath83 given by @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , in light of the previous arguments , we hypothesize that the crossover from ic to sw behavior may be described by the scaling relationship @xmath85 where @xmath86 is any observable measured for the sw algorithm on an @xmath3 sub - lattice immersed in an infinite system , @xmath87 is the same observable measured for the ic algorithm on an @xmath3 sub - lattice of an @xmath40 lattice , @xmath88 is a scaling function with the property that @xmath89 as @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",
    "a word of caution concerning boundary conditions is in order here .",
    "we define @xmath92 to be an observable measured for the sw algorithm on an @xmath40 lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "although we expect @xmath93 to approach a constant for @xmath94 , the constant will in general not be exactly 1 due to the different boundary conditions .    in this paper",
    ", we also seek to define a meaningful dynamic exponent @xmath4 for the ic algorithm that may be compared with exponents for other algorithms as well as with the li - sokal bound .",
    "it is not obvious how to do this since the energy autocorrelation time @xmath27 for the entire system was observed  @xcite to decrease with @xmath1 .",
    "however , this is not the whole story since we have argued above that correlations between successive ic configurations should decay more slowly on length scales @xmath42 .",
    "since we would like @xmath4 to describe the @xmath1-dependence of the slowest mode , we suggest that it is the maximum value of @xmath2 attained for a given @xmath1 that is relevant .",
    "thus we define @xmath4 according to @xmath95 in the next section , we describe simulations designed to measure @xmath4 and to test the scaling hypothesis ( eq .",
    "( [ eqn : scalehyp ] ) ) for the static variable @xmath43 as well as for the dynamic variable @xmath2 .",
    "[ sect : sim ]    we used the invaded cluster algorithm with the topological spanning rule to simulate the two - dimensional ising and 3-state potts models at their critical points for systems ranging in size from @xmath96 to @xmath97 .",
    "starting from a completely ordered state , we performed a number of relaxation steps to allow the system to reach equilibrium at @xmath24 and then collected data for four observables : the energy per spin @xmath29 , the ratio @xmath55 of occupied to satisfied bonds , the fraction @xmath30 of spins in the largest cluster , and the susceptibility @xmath98 , given by the sum of the squared cluster sizes divided by the total number of spins .",
    "in addition to measuring the mean value and variance for each observable , we also measured the autocorrelation function and used this to calculate integrated autocorrelation times . for a given observable @xmath99",
    ", the ( normalized ) autocorrelation function at a given time step @xmath100 can be calculated from a sequence of @xmath101 mc measurements @xmath102 according to @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the mean value of @xmath99 .",
    "the integrated autocorrelation time for the observable @xmath99 is defined by @xmath105 obviously , in practice , the sum must be truncated at some reasonable value of @xmath100 . following the recommendation of ref .",
    "@xcite , we define @xmath106 and choose the cutoff @xmath107 to be the smallest integer such that @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is a constant whose value will be discussed shortly . if the autocorrelation function has the scaling form @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the exponential autocorrelation time , then choosing the cutoff in this manner will insure that @xmath112 is proportional to @xmath113 .",
    "thus estimates of @xmath114 will not be biased by truncating the sum at @xmath115 .",
    "one also would like the values of @xmath112 to approximate @xmath113 as accurately and precisely as possible , and here there is a tradeoff between excluding noise and including as much of the signal as possible . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that if @xmath116 is roughly a single exponential , then choosing a value of @xmath109 in the range 46 would achieve the optimal compromise for @xmath117 in the range @xmath118@xmath119 that we used in our simulations . however , although @xmath116 is well approximated by a single exponential in the case of the sw algorithm , this is not true for the ic algorithm  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , and since we are willing to accept slightly larger statistical uncertainties in order to reduce systematic errors , we used @xmath120 in all our calculations .    in light of the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sect : crossover ] , we also collected data for several sub - system sizes for each @xmath1 .",
    "here we concentrated on the energy per spin , measuring @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath2 for sub - system sizes ranging from @xmath123 to @xmath124 for each @xmath1 .",
    "the sub - systems are squares all sharing a single corner of the lattice .",
    "error bars on all quantities were calculated using the blocking method .",
    "each run was partitioned into @xmath125 contiguous blocks of @xmath101 mc steps each , and the individual blocks treated as independent runs .",
    "although this is an approximation , it will be a good one provided that @xmath101 is large compared to the system s longest relaxation time .",
    "as an example of the blocking method , we obtain the value for , say , @xmath28 by first calculating @xmath126 for each block @xmath50 .",
    "we then calculate the mean @xmath127 and its standard error @xmath128 and report the result @xmath129 .    for both @xmath15 and @xmath17 ,",
    "one long run was initially performed for each lattice size @xmath1 , and the blocking method implemented as just described .",
    "( three independent runs were performed for the case @xmath15 , @xmath97 . )",
    "the number of blocks used ranged from 100 for @xmath96 down to 10 for @xmath97 , and the number @xmath101 of mc steps per block ranged from @xmath130 to @xmath131 . in each case , @xmath101 was greater than the longest observed autocorrelation time for the given system by at least a factor of @xmath132 ( @xmath118 for the smaller lattices ) , thereby making the assumption of independent blocks , used in calculating the error bars , a reasonably good one .",
    "the number of equilibration steps performed at the beginning of each run also exceeded the longest observed @xmath12 by a factor of @xmath132 in all cases .    in these initial runs",
    ", we collected data for sub - system sizes @xmath133 as well as for the whole system ( @xmath134 ) . in order to estimate @xmath4 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : zdef ] ) , we sought to obtain an accurate value for @xmath135 for each @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , once we had learned , from the initial runs , the approximate sub - system size @xmath136 at which @xmath2 attains a maximum , we then performed between one and three additional independent runs for each system and collected data for evenly spaced values of @xmath0 near our rough estimate of @xmath136 . the entire experiment required about 5 months of cpu time on a single processor of a dual - processor 266mhz pentium  ii linux workstation .",

    "we are left with only three data points .",

    ", we suspect that @xmath136 does scale as a power of @xmath1 , but that our error bars on @xmath136 are somewhat underestimated .",
    "there are three aspects of our analysis that could lead to underestimates in the error bars on @xmath159 and @xmath136 .",
    "first , there always exists the possibility that the assumption of normally distributed measurement errors is not valid .",
    "second , the blocking method , used to calculate error bars on values of @xmath2 , treats successive blocks as if they were independent runs , an approximation that may not be entirely justified even though the block length was greater than @xmath202 in all cases .",
    "finally , and probably most importantly , the error bars on @xmath159 and @xmath136 resulting from the weighted @xmath141 fit to a parabola are calculated by assuming that the measurements of @xmath2 at different values of @xmath0 for a given @xmath1 are independent .",
    "this is clearly not a good approximation , since all of the sub - lattices extend outward from the same corner of the @xmath40 lattice .",
    "therefore , all the spins in a given @xmath3 sub - system are also contained in every larger sub - system , and thus sub - systems for comparable values of @xmath0 are highly correlated .    in any case , it is still clear that eq .",
    "( [ eqn : scalehyp ] ) with @xmath91 can not explain the data for @xmath27 .",
    "since the logic leading to the scaling form seems sound , we hypothesize that eq .",
    "( [ eqn : scalehyp ] ) does hold for @xmath27 but that the crossover length for @xmath27 is different from that for @xmath38 so that @xmath203 in the case of @xmath27 .",
    "this seems plausible , since there is no _ a priori _ reason why the thermodynamic argument by which we arrived at @xmath91 must apply to the dynamic quantity @xmath27 . nevertheless , if eq .",
    "( [ eqn : scalehyp ] ) still holds for @xmath27 , we can obtain the crossover exponent @xmath204 from fig .",
    "[ fig : lmaxvsl ] as described above .    to test our scaling hypothesis for @xmath27 , we plot @xmath205 vs.  @xmath189 with @xmath206 ( @xmath207 ) for @xmath15 ( @xmath17 ) in fig .",

    "the values of @xmath208 are taken from ref .",

    "@xcite for @xmath17 .",
    "the data collapse is not terribly convincing in either case , but seems too good to completely rule out eq .",
    "( [ eqn : scalehyp ] ) as the correct asymptotic form .",
    "the fact that both curves extrapolate to about 1 for @xmath196 provides further support for the scaling hypothesis .",

    "[ sect : conclusion ]    using the invaded cluster ( ic ) algorithm with the topological spanning rule , we simulated the critical ising and 3-state potts models in two dimensions for systems ranging in size from @xmath96 to @xmath97 . in accord with previous results  @xcite , we find that the @xmath1-dependence of several static and dynamic quantities is very different from that observed for the swendsen - wang ( sw ) algorithm which samples from the canonical ensemble .",
    "in particular , the quantity @xmath209 is not proportional to the specific heat and the integrated autocorrelation time @xmath27 for the energy per spin decreases with @xmath1 .",
