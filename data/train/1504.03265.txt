    "in lorentzian manifolds , the _ causal relations _ are defined as holding between events that can be joined by future oriented causal curves .",

    "the causal structure was used to recover the _",
    "horismos _ and _ chronology relations _ of a spacetime ( the relations between events that can be joined by future lightlike , respectively timelike curves ) .",
    "the causal structure is known to be sufficient to recover the metric of the spacetime up to a conformal factor .",
    "the conformal factor can be obtained if in addition we know a measure which gives the volume element @xcite .",
    "this works for _ distinguishing spacetimes _  spacetimes whose events can be distinguished by the chronological relations they have with the other events ( for example , spacetimes containing closed timelike curves are not distinguishing ) .",
    "moreover , for distinguishing spacetimes , the causal structure can be obtained from the horismos relation @xcite .",
    "the fact that the causal structure and a measure are enough to recover the geometry of spacetime in general relativity and other relativistic theories of gravity , and the hope that discretization may be the way to quantum gravity by providing an uv cutoff , motivated the study of sets ordered by the causal order @xcite .",
    "another motivation was that a discrete structure could account for the black hole entropy @xcite .",
    "these reasons led in particular to the idea of _ causal set _ , defined as a set @xmath0 endowed with a partial order @xmath1 , which therefore is reflexive , antisymmetric and transitive ( in standard causal set articles and some general relativity articles like @xcite the notation `` @xmath2 '' is used , but in standard general relativity articles and textbooks like @xcite the notation `` @xmath1 '' is preferred ) .",
    "in addition , it is required that for any @xmath3 , the cardinality of the set @xmath4 is finite @xcite . in the causal set approach ,",
    "the continuous spacetime is considered to be an effective limit of the causal set .",
    "the measure used to recover the volume element is given by the number of events in each region .",
    "as sorkin put it , `` order plus number equals geometry '' .    however , causal sets do nt have a definite dimension .",
    "one sort of dimension is the smallest dimension of a minkowski spacetime in which the causal set can be embedded ( flat conformal dimension ) , but there are more possible definitions of dimension , such as statistical and spectral dimensions @xcite , none of them satisfactory enough for this problem .",
    "this is probably the main reason why it is so difficult to prove and even to formulate mathematically the fundamental conjecture of causal sets ( _ hauptvermutung _ ) , that the causal set can recover within reasonable approximation ( yet to be defined ) the manifold structure . in the limiting case of infinite event density",
    "uniformly distributed , the conjecture has been proven @xcite , but in general the problem remains open .    in the following , we consider sets of events endowed with a reflexive relation which represents the horismos relation .",
