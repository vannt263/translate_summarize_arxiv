    "in particular , we used ordinary time ",
    "independent non  degenerate quantum perturbation theory to cast the qpdf in a simple analytical form , which can be easily calculated in a subroutine incorporated in the fitting program .",
    "moreover , we showed how the limits of validity ( sensibility of the quantum treatment and perturbative hypothesis ) can be monitored and we described how to implement a simple statistical test to estimate the sensitivity of the qpdf to the third and fourth  order terms in the potential .",
    "the latter procedure can be used _ a posteriori _ to check whether the best  fit values of the anharmonic parameters are above the sensitivity level ( minimum detectable anharmonicity ) .",
    "alternatively , the same procedure may be applied _ a priori _ in order to assess whether the qpdf is suitable for the analysis of the problem at hand .",
    "we applied our formalism to the case of silver iodide , showing how the potential anharmonicity can be measured in a temperature range where the classical expression of the pdf could not be used .",
    "in particular , we demonstrated how a simple harmonic model is not adequate to describing the dynamics of the ag ",
    "i pair , in agreement with previous studies performed in the classical regime .    as a final remark",
    ", it should be noted that the example we chose to test the qpdf concerns a very symmetric lattice structure .",
    "it is well known that an additional broadening of the distributions of absorber ",
    "neighbour distances may be produced by static disorder .",
    "the latter may be associated for example with the presence of a coordination shell made of @xmath90 identical atoms at slightly different distances from the photoabsorber , that can not be resolved in different subshells ( e.g. @xmath171 at distance @xmath172 and @xmath173 at distance @xmath174 , with @xmath175 ) . for small static disorder ( @xmath176 )",
    ", one can prove that such shell is equivalent to a shell with coordination @xmath90 and mean distance @xmath177 , provided one introduces in the debye ",
    "waller factor the additional variance @xmath178  @xcite . in the framework of our model ,",
    "this is expected to correspondingly rescale the harmonic constant @xmath89 .",
    "however , it should not alter in general the information carried by the exafs signal regarding the anharmonic terms of the absorber ",
    "neighbour effective potential .",
    "hence , we expect that our model of lattice anharmonicities may be sensibly used in its present form also in the presence of small static disorder .",
    "concluding , we developed an easy technique to study interatomic potentials from single  scattering exafs in the quantum regime of atomic vibrations .",
