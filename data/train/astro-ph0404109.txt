    "the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) has provided strong evidence for an optical depth for electron scattering of 0.17 @xmath1 0.04 based on the large scale polarization pattern related to rescattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons ( kogut et al .",
    "if the reionization process is described as instantaneous and homogeneous , the measured optical depth implies a reionization redshift of @xmath2 in a spatially flat universe .",
    "interestingly , the derived redshift for reionization is at the high end of expectations in models in which stellar populations are dominant reionization sources ( e.g. , cen 2003 ; fukugita & kawasaki 2003 ; venkatesan , tumlinson & shull 2003 ; wyithe & loeb 2003 ; sokasian et al .",
    "thus , in some of these models , primordial stars , the so - called population iii stars , are assumed to be rather massive and hence have a large uv photon emission rate , as suggested by recent theoretical studies ( e.g. abel , bryan & norman 2002 ; bromm , coppi & larson 2002 ; bromm , kudritzki & loeb 2001 ; schaerer 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "the formation of such massive stars in the early universe has many important cosmological implications ( e.g. , carr , bond , & arnett 1984 ; oh , cooray  kamionkowski 2003 ; yoshida , bromm & hernquist 2004 ) . because radiation below the lyman - limit is absorbed by neutral hydrogen , luminous sources at redshifts 10 and higher",
    "are generally seen only in the near - ir band . in particular ,",
    "if pop  iii stars are formed primarily at redshifts between 10 and 30 , they are expected to contribute to the infrared background ( irb ) light at wavelengths between 1 and 5 @xmath0 m at present epoch ( bond , carr & hogan 1986 ) .",
    "recent estimates based on theoretical models suggest that a large fraction of the irb total intensity may indeed be due to these stars ( santos et al .",
    "2002 ; salvaterra & ferrara 2003 ; cooray et al .",
    "a substantial irb could arise from the pop  iii stars not only due to the direct emission associated with these stars , but also due to indirect processes that lead to free - free and lyman-@xmath3 emission from the ionized nebulae , or hii regions , surrounding these stars .",
    "observationally , about 20 - 40% of the near - ir flux ( between @xmath4 1 @xmath0 m and 3 @xmath0 m ) has been resolved by point sources ( cambrsy et al .",
    "2001 ; totani et al . 2001 ) ; while j- and k - band source counts go down to ab - magnitudes of @xmath4 28 and 25 , respectively , the cumulative surface brightness converges by a magnitude around 23 , say , in the k - band ( see for a review of existing data by pozzetti & madau 2000 ) . the missing ir flux could be either due to a high - z population of galaxies , such as the proto - galaxy population related to first stars ( santos et al .",
    "2002 ; salvaterra & ferrara 2003 ) , or a population of low surface brightness galaxies at nearby redshifts .",
    "while there still remains uncertainties , one can potentially understand the presence of first luminous sources and some details related to their population , such as the number density , by characterizing the background light from optical to infrared at wavelengths of a few micron . in this wavelength range ,",
    "final products of these massive stars are also expected to contribute to irb , in addition to the direct emission from stars ; radiation from supernovae and primordial black holes , in the form of miniquasars , may be significant sources of emission .",
    "the role of final products in contributing to the irb , relative to the progenitor stars , depends on the initial mass function of the first stars .    as the end state of a massive star above @xmath5 is a complete collapse to a black hole (",
    "heger & woosley 2002 ) , if the first stellar population is extremely top - heavy with all mass above this limit , then one expects roughly a similar number density of black holes as that of stars .",
    "these black holes grow via accretion and/or mergers and may partly be responsible for early reionization if they radiate as miniquasars ( haiman & loeb 1998 ; madau et al .",
    "2004 ; ricotti & ostriker 2003 ) . the uv output from such quasars , if not absorbed heavily by the surrounding torii , can contribute both to reionization and to the ir flux as viewed today .",
    "the unresolved soft x - ray background at energies between 0.5 and 2 kev may rule out a large density of miniquasars at high redshifts as required to reionize the universe from the quasar emission alone ( dijkstra , haiman & loeb 2004 ) unless reionization by miniquasars , within uncertainties of models used in dijkstra et al .",
    ", is completed by a redshift of 20 .",
    "here , we suggest that if all massive stars are eventually converted to black holes and accrete efficiently at the eddington - rate ( as would be the case if miniquasars are responsible for eventual reionization of the universe ) , then the ir background is overproduced .",
    "a more realistic situation could be that the mass function is broad , and only a small fraction of the total initial stellar mass is converted to black holes ; current understanding of the irb may limit the mass fraction of stars above 260 m@xmath6 to a level less than 10% .",
    "this constraint can be relaxed if miniquasars radiate less efficiently below the eddington - limit ; such a scenario may be viable if stellar sources dominate the uv photon production and are , thus , responsible for reionization , though some fraction of stellar mass is converted to miniquasars .    the initial mass function of the first stars could potentially be dominated by stars with masses in the range between 140 and 260 @xmath7 . in this case , the final product will be a complete disruption of the star via the pair - instability process ( heger & woosley 2002 ) . in the case of such massive stars , in general ,",
    "one expects a typical supernovae to be much brighter than the star , suggesting that a modest contribution to the irb could come from supernovae , when compared to the fractional contribution from stellar emission alone .",
    "however , though supernovae are in fact brighter than an average star , the duration over which most optical flux is emitted is relatively smaller .",
    "we show that this results in a small but non - negligible contribution to the irb from supernovae associated with massive pop  iii stars . while the background contribution is smaller , these supernovae are likely to be detectable directly in deep ir images above 1 @xmath0 m down to ab - magnitude limits at the level of 26 and fainter .    in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the contribution to irb from the first generation of stars , supernovae , and miniquasars under the assumption that the early stellar population is dominated by very massive stars . in the case of supernovae , we will suggest that , while the relative contribution to the irb may be lower , individual detections may be possible with deep - ir imaging .",
    "we also suggest that the ir background itself may be used to constrain the presence of early mini - quasars . throughout the paper ,",
    "we make use of a @xmath8cdm cosmological model consistent with current data ( e.g. , tegmark et al .",
    "2004 ) with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , the spectral index of the primordial power @xmath12 , and a normalization for the matter power spectrum with @xmath13 .",
    "our calculations of the first - source contribution to the irb follow previous calculations in the literature related to the stellar contribution to the irb ( santos et al . 2002 ; salvaterra & ferrara 2003 ; cooray et al .",
    "2004 ; kashlinsky et al .",
    "these studies involve two basic ingredients : ( 1 ) the rate at which the volume density of first - sources evolves and ( 2 ) the flux spectrum .",
    "we extend these calculations to supernovae and miniquasars , which have been so far ignored in previous estimates , under the assumption that ( 1 ) the supernova rate in the early universe traces that of the star formation and ( 2 ) the formation rate of miniquasars is simply related to the formation rate of seed black holes , taken to be proportional to the star - formation , and to a model description for accretion .",
    "we use a simple model to describe the spectrum and the light curve of supernovae following results from heger et al .",

    "2004 ; dijkstra , haiman & loeb 2004 ) .",
    "regardless of the exact shape of the spectrum , there is also an uncertainty with respect to the overall normalization , or the total luminosity of a given miniquasar . here",
    ", we make the assumption that miniquasars radiate efficiently at the maximum allowed by the eddington - limit . in making this choice ,",
    "we are guided by observations of quasars out to redshifts of 6 which indicate maximal emission at the eddington - limit .",
    "these quasars are more massive and more luminous than the miniquasar counterparts at high redshifts .",
    "it is likely that the miniquasar emission is submaximal .",
    "the limits we derive here on the fraction on miniquasars present during the reionization era should , thus , only be taken as a conservative limit on the low end given the current state of knowledge on the ir background .      in order to calculate the formation rate of first stars and the subsequent supernovae or seed black holes , we use an analytical description for halo formation following the press - schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ) .",
    "we write the star - formation rate as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the minimum mass of halos in which gas can cool , and we take the star - formation efficiency @xmath20 .",
    "we consider two cases for @xmath19 with a minimum virial temperature of 400 k , involving molecular hydrogen ( e.g. , tegmark et al .",
    "1997 ) , and 10@xmath15k involving atomic hydrogen line cooling ( barkana & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "the respective star - formation rates are shown in fig .  1 ( top panel ) .",
    "we mention that , although more detailed modeling of early star formation is available ( e.g. hernquist & springel 2003 ; yoshida et al .",
    "2003 ) , the overall feedback effects from mini - quasars on star - formation are still uncertain ( see , e.g. machacek , bryan , abel 2003 ) .",

    "we will comment on this later in the discussion . as shown in fig .  2",
    ", the level of the incident flux from a typical star and a miniquasar is similar .",
    "the spectrum and light curve for population  iii supernovae were calculated by heger et al .",
    "in these calculations , the relevant ir emission , as observed today , characterizing the peak of the light curve , is delayed a month or so from the initial explosion and the resulting shock break out .",
    "the latter includes emission at short wavelengths , below the lyman limit , in the supernova frame , which is likely be absorbed by the intergalactic medium at epochs prior to complete reionization .",
    "the peak of the light curve extends over a month at most . in order to make a reasonable estimate of the supernovae contribution to the irb",
    ", we use the peak emission and its duration only and ignore detailed aspects of the light curve when fluxes drop below more than a factor of 10 from the peak emission . including the full light curve only leads to minor corrections at a a few percent level . while the peak emission is flat such that @xmath67 is a constant in the estimate by heger et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , to study any departures , we also allow the spectrum to vary as @xmath68 with @xmath3 between -0.5 and 0.5 , with @xmath69 as the fiducial case . when varying the spectral shape , we renormalize such that the total flux , or the luminosity , remains constant in the rest wavelengths between 10@xmath14 @xmath70 and 10@xmath15 @xmath70 corresponding to the uv and optical regimes . here , again",
    ", we assume that the surrounding medium is reionized by stellar emission before the supernova explosion and that the rest uv emission is not absorbed .",
    "the reionization by supernovae may not be important as the time scale over which the rest uv emission is expected is significantly smaller than that of a star ( a month vs. a few million years , respectively ) .",
    "note that the supernova spectrum of a pop iii star is highly uncertain in terms of spectral shape at the uv end and more numerical models are needed to further address the extent to which supernovae may be an important source of ionizing photons .",
    "a more likely scenario involving pop iii supernovae is the one described in oh , cooray & kamionkowski ( 2003 ) , where the blast wave propagates to the dense ionized igm and heats the electrons to a substantial temperature which subsequently cools via inverse compton - scattering off of the cosmic microwave background , similar to the same effect related to hot electrons in galaxy clusters ( the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ; sunyaev & zeldovich 1980 ) .",
    "we summarize our results in fig .  3 , where we show the contributions to total irb light from stars , supernovae and miniquasars .",
    "in the case of stars , we divide the contribution to the three main components ; direct emission from stars , lyman-@xmath3 recombination radiation from the ionized patch , and the free - free component related to electron - ion scatterings within each ionized patch surrounding these stars .",
    "our calculations related to the irb light due to stars are consistent with those in santos et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and salvaterra & ferrara ( 2003 ) , except that here we have assumed a slightly different redshift limit to the first generation of stars at a value of 10 instead of values such as 7 and 8 used in those calculations that are aimed at explaining the total missing content .",
    "our results suggest that , while the emission associated with stars can explain most of the irb intensities , the fractional contribution from supernovae is an order of magnitude smaller than the stellar emission contribution .",
    "the relative difference between stars and supernovae is easily understood based on the typical flux from a star vs. a supernovae and the ages over which these fluxes are emitted .",
    "for example , typical @xmath4 200 m@xmath71 star at a redshift of 20 has a flux , ignoring lyman-@xmath3 emission , of order @xmath4 10@xmath72 ergs cm@xmath63 s@xmath64 hz@xmath64 ( @xmath74 njy or @xmath75 ) , while the peak flux of the supernovae at the same redshift is at the level of @xmath4 few times 10@xmath76 ergs cm@xmath63 s@xmath64 hz@xmath64 ( @xmath4 1 @xmath0jy or @xmath4 @xmath77 ) . even if all the stars at redshifts greater than 10 die as supernovae , though the instant flux is greater , the total output of @xmath78 from supernovae is smaller than stars as the stellar emission lasts over a million years while the peak flux from supernovae lasts just over a month or so .",
    "thus , the apparent high ratio of the _ peak _ luminosity is largely compensated by the age difference so that the typical ratio of a supernova to stellar flux remains at most at the level of @xmath4 0.1 .",
    "note that the stellar contribution to the irb also includes a substantial fraction from the lyman-@xmath3 emission of absorbed ionizing uv photons during subsequent recombinations .",
    "we have not included such a contribution from individual pop iii supernovae because of uncertainty in the supernovae spectrum at the uv end .",
    "note also that regions surrounding supernovae is likely to have been ionized by the progenitor stars .",
    "even if the igm between proto - halos are partly ionized , the resulting lyman-@xmath3 emission is expected to be suppressed relative to the case of stellar sources .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the lyman-@xmath3 spectrum , as a function of frequency , can be written as @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the fit to the lyman-@xmath3 profile of loeb & rybicki ( 1999 ) by santos et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and the production rate of lyman-@xmath3 photons from recombinations is @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the electron density of the surrounding medium , @xmath83 is the case - b recombination coefficient for hi as a function of the electron temperature @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is the ionizing photon production rate ( see santos et al .",
    "2002 for details ) . to estimate @xmath85 , we assume that the supernovae spectrum is flat ( in rest @xmath16 below the lyman - limit ) and given the uncertainty in spectral shape",
    ", we take the production rate to be that associated with ionizing photons at the wavelength corresponding to the lyman - limit . the model related to stars",
    "is shown in fig .  2 , where the unabsorbed spectrum peaks at a wavelength of @xmath4 300 @xmath70 ( rest frame ) .",
    "the difference in flux , as suggested above , translates to a stellar - to - supernovae ionizing photon production rate difference of @xmath4 10@xmath86 to 10@xmath87 .",
    "this should then be compared to the ratio of ages , which is again , @xmath88 between stars and supernovae .",
    "furthermore , in the case of supernovae , the lyman-@xmath3 radiation is more likely to be associated with tenuous igm with density @xmath89 @xmath90 compared to dense nebulae surrounding stars ( with density @xmath91 @xmath90 ) .",
    "this lowers the lyman-@xmath3 flux by another factor of 10@xmath92 relative to that of stars , resulting in an overall reduction of 10@xmath86 to 10@xmath93 in the lyman-@xmath3 contribution from stars to supernovae .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that the difference between predicted supernovae background and the missing irb flux can be reconciled with the expected increase associated with lyman-@xmath3 emission if the uv emission from supernovae are absorbed during the reionization process .",
    "intriguingly , redshifted light from early miniquasars can explain the ir excess at wavelengths around 1 @xmath0 m , as shown in fig  3(c ) .",
    "in fact , if _ all _ stars collapse to become seed black holes , we find that the flux from miniquasars that grow down to @xmath94 will _ exceed _ the measured ir fluxes by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "a fractional contribution of @xmath95 to 10% of initial stellar mass to seed black holes appears consistent with observations .",
    "this is based on our assumption that the miniquasars are radiating efficiently at the maximum given by the eddington - limit . as discussed at the beginning of section  2 ,",
    "the extent to which such an assumption , based on observations of luminous quasars at redshifts less than 6 , applies to high - redshift miniquasars is unclear .",
    "if the radiation from miniquasars , with masses between 10@xmath14 m@xmath6 and 10@xmath15 m@xmath6 , is submaximal , the derived limit on the fractional contribution from @xmath95 to 10% can be increased .",
    "thus our result should be considered as a _ weak _ constraint .    since the typical stellar age is @xmath96 years ( bromm , kudritzki & loeb 2001 ) , at a redshift of around 10 , using the highest star - formation rate in fig .  1 ( top panel )",
    ", one finds a typical density of order a few times @xmath97 @xmath7 mpc@xmath98 in stars . from the bottom panel of fig .  1",
    ", one finds that the density of miniquasars is typically",
    "@xmath99 @xmath7 mpc@xmath98 .",
    "this apparent increase in miniquasar density , however , is compensated by the fact that the miniquasars flux , at relevant wavelengths , is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than that of a typical very massive star ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the exact numerical calculation reveals that the miniquasars do dominate the background if the fraction of stars converted to seed black holes is large . in other words ,",
    "the irb offers a useful way to constrain the presence and abundance of miniquasars at @xmath100 ; under our assumption , an initial mass fraction of black holes , relative to stars , of order 10% and below seems consistent with current observations .",
    "this conclusion may indeed be strengthened if ionizing photons from miniquasars are absorbed by the neutral igm ; if absorbed , we expect some fraction of the energy to be reradiated in the form of the lyman-@xmath3 line and to increase the irb at the corresponding frequencies such that the upper bound on the black hole mass fration is further reduced . on the other hand ,",
    "as discussed in the case for supernovae above , we do not expect the lyman-@xmath3 radiation to be significant as long as the dense nebula surrounding quasar is fully ionized already by the stellar emission prior to the formation of the miniquasar .",
    "the miniquasar emission can ionize the igm beyond the nebula , but due to the lower density , recombinations are unlikely to be significant such that the lyman-@xmath3 emission is suppressed relative to the case where stars form and ionize dense nebulae surrounding such stars initially .",
    "our suggestion that the seed mass fraction must be below 10% , assuming efficient radiation at the eddington - limit , also suggests that the universe can not be reionized by early quasars alone . for reference , in fig .  3",
    ", we show the model in which the uv photons from miniquasars are absorbed by neutral igm during the reionization process ( thick dot - dashed line in the figure ) . integrating the uv light below the hydrogen lyman - limit",
    ", we find a ratio of number density of photons relative to mean density of baryons at the level of 0.3 at @xmath101 ; to fully reionize , one would expect this ratio to be at least unity or as high as 25 as the recombinations are important at high redshifts . in oh , cooray & kamionkowski ( 2003 ) , it was estimated that @xmath102 photons per baryon are needed to explain an optical depth to reionization of 0.12 when the clumping factor of ionized gas @xmath103 is 4 and the escape fraction of ionized photons is 0.3 , consistent with other estimates ( e.g. , dijkstra , haiman & loeb 2004 ) .",
    "note also that ionization by a combination of hard x - rays and secondary electrons does not lead to complete ionization , as argued by madau et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "our constraint on the total mass fraction of miniquasar - seed blackholes is independent of similar suggestions in the literature , for example , based on the unresolved x - ray background ( dijkstra , haiman & loeb 2004 ) .",
    "these authors argue that the x - ray background would be violated by a population of miniquasars if they are responsible for complete reionization . if we consider a scenario where miniquasars exist with stars , with a seed miniquasar mass fraction of 10% , we find that the x - ray background constraint at 1 kev is not violated by this miniquasar population even in the extreme case where the spectrum is normalized to the eddington - limit .",
    "interestingly , the level of the irb background from the same population is consistent with current observations .",
    "given the uncertainties in the available observations and in our analytical model , we are not yet able to exactly establish the allowed seed mass fraction .",
    "although current observations of the irb are still uncertain , one can improve the limit related to the mass fraction of seed black holes further by future background measurements . in fig .",
    "3(c ) , we show the 1@xmath104 noise , or detection , level related to a planned low - resolution spectroscopic background measurement on a rocket experiment ( t. matsumoto , private communication ) for irb fluctuation studies ( e.g. , magliocchetti et al .",
    "2003 ; cooray et al .",
    "the detection limit comes from the addition of 400 spectra over a 30 second integration time at an altitude above 300 km ( which removes the air - glow ) and after a foreground source subtraction down to 14 , 15.9 and 16.3 magnitudes in i- , j- and k - bands .",
    "the background can be measured to a level of 1 nw m@xmath63 sr@xmath64 , whereas the limiting factor in these measurements will be related to the removal of the zodiacal light ( e.g. , cambrsy et al . 2001 ) . in this case of the rocket experiment , this removal is achieved with data taken as a function of the latitude such that , when combined with multifrequency aspect , removal down to the instrumental noise level is expected .",
    "the proposed measurement would help establish the excess above galactic stars and foreground sources better than what is currently known and , in return , limit the extent to which high - z sources , either in the form of stars and/or miniquasars , may be present",
    ".      one may consider the possibility whether the constraint from the irb can be relaxed if the rest uv and optical emission from miniquasars is heavily absorbed by dust .",
    "first , we note that the extinction by inter - galactic dust is unimportant at @xmath100 even if nearly all the first stars die as pair - instability supernovae ( see yoshida et al .",
    "if the inter - stellar absorption due to dust within ( proto-)galaxies that are hosting miniquasars is significant , the reradiation by thermal dust at far - ir wavelengths at @xmath105 m and above can still be used to put limits on their abundance .",
    "assuming the same spectrum as shown in fig .  2 for quasars , which allows for significant dust absorption , we predict a 850 @xmath0 m background of @xmath4 50 nw m@xmath63 sr@xmath64 , for @xmath106% while the observed background is below a few nw m@xmath63 sr@xmath64 ( hauser & dwek 2001 ) .",
    "this suggests that even for the 5% seed mass case , which may explain the missing irb , absorption by dust can not be as significant as for low redshift luminous quasars . keeping the same seed mass fraction",
    ", one can refine the extent to which dust absorption is significant by studying the unresolved background at these far - ir wavelengths . while @xmath4 40% of the 850 @xmath0 m and 350 @xmath0 m backgrounds have now been resolved , the counts are such that a small extrapolation to a slightly lower flux density resolves the whole background ( borys et al .",
    "2003 ) . unlike the near - ir background where surface brightness converges down to ab magnitudes of @xmath107 , as observed",
    "counts go deeper , such a convergence is not found at far - ir wavelengths .",
    "thus , it ll be useful to return to this aspect in the future when source counts are well defined . as an early conclusion ,",
    "we are forced to consider the possibility that the far - ir background can be fully explained with resolved source counts alone .",
    "this , when combined with irb measurements , suggests that a substantial population of `` dusty '' miniquasars is unlikely to be present at @xmath100 .",
    "the cosmic infrared background ( irb ) at wavelengths between 1 @xmath0 m and 3 @xmath0 m provides a useful probe of the global star - formation rate prior to and during the reionization .",
    "we have studied the relative contributions from first stars , supernovae and early miniquasars to the infrared background ( irb ) .",
    "in addition to massive stars , the irb flux may be dominated by a population of miniquasars , especially if the first generation of stars are very massive and the end product of the stars lead to a substantial population of black holes that will effectively radiate as miniquasars by matter accretion .",
    "we use the press - schechter formalism that describes dark halo formation , and combine it with a simple star - formation model to calculate the cosmic star - formation history , the supernova rate , and the blackhole formation rate at high redshift .",
    "we follow previous calculations of the source spectrum for stars , while for population  iii supernovae , we use a simple description of the peak emission and its duration .",
    "we describe the flux spectrum of miniquasars using an average spectrum as observed for luminous quasars at redshifts less than 5 based on observed data and models by sazonov et al .",
    "we fix the freedom related to the overall normalization of this spectrum by assuming that the miniquasars radiate efficiently at the maximum allowed by the eddington - limit . under this assumption , we find that a mass fraction of seed black holes , relative to pop  iii stars , at the level of @xmath108 and below is consistent with observations",
    ". this upper limit on the seed mass fraction can naturally be extended to a higher value if miniquasars radiate below the eddington - limit , so the limit we derive should be considered as on the lower side rather than a strict upper limit .",
    "future spectroscopic background measurements exploiting rockets will improve the observational uncertainties and hence the constraints on the high - redshift miniquasar population .    while the integrated light from population iii supernovae to the irb is subdominant ,",
    "one can potentially consider the possibility of directly detecting individual supernovae in high resolution deep ir imaging data . given the star formation rate density and the expected flux , we estimate the surface density of supernovae to be order few tens per sqr .",
    "degree over a year , if the star - formation rate is close to 0.5 m@xmath71 yr@xmath64 mpc@xmath98 at @xmath94 , and assuming that all stars are massive ( @xmath109 m@xmath71 ) . for the high redshift supernovae , the typical ab magnitudes are at the level of 26 in 1.5 @xmath0 m ( heger et al .",
    "these are within reach of deep ir imaging with existing large telescopes and from space and , in the long term , clearly within reach of missions such as the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) , which can detect point sources down to a magnitude limit of 31 around the same wavelengths in a 10@xmath15 sec exposure in its 16 arcmin@xmath14 field of view .",
