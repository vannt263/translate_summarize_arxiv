    "vector equations are an important and rather well studied class of integrable system . among others , we mention but a few works in this area @xcite containing the examples and classification results for the vectorial systems of derivative nonlinear schrdinger type which are in some relation to the theme of our paper .",
    "there are also several interesting results for the vector differential - difference equations , or lattices , see e.g. @xcite , but this field seems less investigated .",
    "the aim of our work is the study of the vector lattices @xmath0 \\label{v2 }   v_{n , x}=\\sp < v_n , v_n>(v_{n+1}-v_{n-1}),\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] which define two integrable generalizations of the very well known modified volterra lattice .",
    "equation ( [ v1 ] ) was introduced in @xcite among the other examples of the multi - component lattices related to jordan algebraic structures .",
    "second lattice is considered here for the first time , up to our knowledge , despite of its more simple form .",
    "the main tool in the study of a nonlinear integrable equation is its representation as the compatibility condition for auxiliary linear systems . in the differential - difference setting this method",
    "was developed in the classical papers @xcite . in our paper",
    "we restrict ourselves by the version of dressing method based on darboux - bcklund transformations and their nonlinear superposition principle .",
    "the main results for the scalar lattice are given in section [ s.sc ] .",
    "the main body of the paper , sections [ s.v1 ] , [ s.v2 ] , contains generalizations of this method for both vector lattices ( [ v1 ] ) , ( [ v2 ] ) , as well as the simplest explicit solutions of soliton and breather type .    a characteristic feature of integrability is the consistency of the equation with an infinite hierarchy of other equations . in particular , bcklund transformations define the discrete part of this hierarchy and lead to the discrete equations on the square grid . usually , one starts this way from the continuous equations of kdv type , however an understanding appeared recently that the lattice equations of volterra type lead to the same result as well @xcite .",
    "this relation has not been observed in the vector case yet , although the discrete equation related to the lattice ( [ v1 ] ) has been introduced in the paper @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the continuous part of the picture ( section [ s.sym ] ) is more traditional .",
    "it was observed in works of levi @xcite and shabat , yamilov @xcite that integrable volterra type lattices define a special kind of bcklund transformations for equations of nonlinear schrdinger type .",
    "this remains valid for the vector analogs as well .",
    "the connection with a two - dimensional lattice relative to the volterra lattice introduced by mikhailov @xcite is of interest , too .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the approach based on the continuous symmetries is the most effective one in the classification problem of integrable equations , both continuous and discrete @xcite .",
    "the complete classification of scalar volterra type lattices was obtained by yamilov @xcite by use of the symmetry approach , see also @xcite .",
    "some progress in classification of vector equations and lattices has been achieved recently @xcite .",
    "we discuss some open problems in this field in the concluding section [ s.more ] .",
    "the following notations for the auxiliary linear equations are used throughout the paper : @xmath1 modified volterra lattice @xmath2 is equivalent to the compatibility condition @xmath3 with the matrices @xmath4    -v_n & \\la \\end{pmatrix},\\quad   a_n=\\begin{pmatrix }    \\dfrac{a^2}{\\la^2}+v_{n-1}v_n   & \\dfrac{a}{\\la}v_n+\\la v_{n-1}\\\\[1em ]    -\\dfrac{a}{\\la}v_{n-1}-\\la v_n & \\la^2+v_{n-1}v_n \\end{pmatrix}.\\ ] ] the darboux - bcklund transformation is defined by the matrix @xmath5    ( a^2-\\mu^4)\\la f_n & a\\mu(\\la^2-\\mu^2)-\\mu(a^2-\\mu^2\\la^2)f^2_n \\end{pmatrix}.\\ ] ] moreover , the compatibility condition @xmath6 is equivalent to the pair of discrete riccati equation for the variable @xmath7 : @xmath8 and the condition @xmath9 completes this system with the continuous riccati equation @xmath10 notice also that the variable @xmath7 satisfies , in virtue of equations ( [ sc.vvff ] ) , ( [ sc.vvf ] ) , the lattice @xmath11 starting from a known solution @xmath12 of the lattice ( [ sc.vx ] ) the common solution of the first equation ( [ sc.vvff ] ) and equation ( [ sc.vvf ] ) is constructed by the formula @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a particular solution of two first equations ( [ sc.lam ] ) at @xmath15 .",

    "the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath24 are defined from the equations @xmath25 and the corresponding solution of the linear equations is @xmath26 ( we do not consider the case of multiple roots @xmath27 which leads to rational in @xmath28 solutions ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath13 defines the solution of the lattice ( [ sc.fx ] ) of kink type ( provided @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) and the substitution into the second equation ( [ sc.vvff ] ) gives the soliton of the lattice ( [ sc.vx ] ) .",
    "the construction of @xmath31-soliton solution uses the set of particular solutions @xmath32 corresponding to the values of parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 . if @xmath36 then the lattice ( [ sc.vx ] ) admits the breather solutions corresponding to the pairs of complex conjugated points in the discrete spectrum ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) .",
    "the direct recomputing of the variables @xmath39 is a more convenient way to iterate the darboux transformation than applying the matrices @xmath40 and recomputing the wave functions .",
    "this leads to the nonlinear superposition principle of darboux transformations in the form of some yang - baxter mapping @xcite .",
    "let the variables @xmath41 be constructed from the particular solutions of the linear systems at @xmath42 , and let @xmath43 denote the variables obtained from @xmath41 by consequent application of darboux transforms with parameters @xmath44 .",
    "then the permutability of darboux transformations is equivalent to the following equality for the matrices of the form ( [ sc.m ] ) : @xmath45 where @xmath46 stands for a tail sequence of distinct indices .",
    "this equation is uniquely solvable with respect to @xmath47 and thus the mapping is defined @xmath48 \\label{sc.r }   r(f , g;\\mu,\\nu)=   \\frac{\\mu\\nu^3(\\nu g-\\mu f)-a\\nu(\\mu^2-\\nu^2)fg^2-a^2(\\mu g-\\nu f ) }        { \\mu\\nu^3(\\mu g-\\nu f)g+a\\nu(\\mu^2-\\nu^2)-a^2(\\nu g-\\mu f)g}.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    another formulation of nonlinear superposition principle brings to a discrete 4-point equation on the square grid for some new variable @xmath49 ( the subscript corresponds to the shift in the volterra lattice and is dummy , superscripts enumerate the darboux transformations ) .",
    "this equation is not too convenient for the purpose of the vector generalizations which we have in mind , however it is of interest by itself and we spend some space to describe it .",
    "the form of the equation depends on the sign of @xmath21 .    in the simplest case",
    "@xmath50 equations ( [ sc.vvff ] ) imply the relation @xmath51 which allows to introduce the variable @xmath52 accordingly to the equations @xmath53 this change turns the relations ( [ sc.vvff ] ) into a single equation @xmath54 which define darboux transformation in terms of the variable @xmath55 .",
    "now , consider another darboux transformation corresponding to the value @xmath56 : @xmath57 the easy calculation proves that the double darboux transformations coincide : @xmath58 and moreover , the common value is given by the superposition formula : @xmath59 in other words , the darboux transformations and superposition formula form the triple which is 3d - consistent , or consistent around a cube @xcite .",
    "the iterations of darboux transformation bring to the discrete equation on the square grid ( with fixed subscript ) @xmath60 this is a very well - known 3d - consistent equation which defines as well the nonlinear superposition principle of the classical darboux transformation for schrdinger operator .",
    "this coincidence is not too surprising since it is known for long that volterra type lattices are symmetries of the dressing chains which define bcklund transformations for kdv type equations ( this relation was discussed , from the different points of view , e.g. in @xcite ) .",
    "analogously , in the case @xmath61 the variable @xmath52 is introduced accordingly to the formulae @xmath62 after this the relations ( [ sc.vvff ] ) turn into equation @xmath63 and ( [ sc.0nsp ] ) is replaced by equation @xmath64 where @xmath65 , which is equivalent to nonlinear superposition principle for @xmath66-gordon equation .    finally , if @xmath67 then the change @xmath68 is used which brings equations ( [ sc.vvff ] ) to the form @xmath69 and leads to equation @xmath70 equivalent to nonlinear superposition principle for @xmath71-gordon equation .",
    "equation ( [ sc .- nsp ] ) turns into ( [ sc.+nsp ] ) under the complex change @xmath72 , so that these equations are two different real forms of one and the same equation .    concluding this section",
    ", we notice that an analogous construction scheme exists also for solutions of the volterra lattice @xmath73 the corresponding formulae are even much simpler , for example the equations @xmath74 replaces ( [ sc.vvff ] ) while the role of the lattice ( [ sc.fx ] ) is played by the lattice ( [ sc.vx ] ) at @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , the lattice ( [ sc.fx ] ) is actually the second modification of volterra lattice .",
    "this sequence is analogous to the sequence of equations kdv @xmath76 mkdv @xmath76 @xmath77-cd which can be obtained by continuous limit from the lattices under consideration .",
    "unfortunately , although the volterra lattice admits some multi - component generalizations @xcite , the vector ones are absent , this is why we have started from the more complicated object .",
    "sometimes the zero curvature representation for a vector generalization can be obtained just by passing to the block matrices . unfortunately ,",
    "this is not the case for the matrices ( [ sc.la ] ) , ( [ sc.m ] ) .",
    "it turns out , however , that such block generalization is easy if one consider the linear equations for the length 3 vector with the components consisting of the products of the components of @xmath78 .",
    "additionally , it is convenient to apply a gauge transformation in order to make the determinants of the matrices @xmath79 constant and the matrix @xmath80 traceless . in this way",
    "we come to the following matrices which define , as can be easily verified , the zero curvature representation for the lattice ( [ sc.vx ] ) at @xmath50 and its bcklund transformation : @xmath81    0 & -1 & \\dfrac{\\la}{v_n}\\\\[1em ]    1 & -\\dfrac{2\\la}{v_n } & \\dfrac{\\la^2}{v^2_n }    \\end{pmatrix},\\qquad   m_n=\\begin{pmatrix }    \\dfrac{\\la^2}{\\mu^2f^2_n } & -\\dfrac{2\\la}{\\mu f_n } & 1\\\\[1em ]    \\dfrac{\\la}{\\mu f_n } & -1-\\dfrac{\\la^2}{\\mu^2 } & \\dfrac{\\la f_n}{\\mu } \\\\[1em ]    1 & -\\dfrac{2\\la f_n}{\\mu }   & \\dfrac{\\la^2f^2_n}{\\mu^2}\\end{pmatrix},\\]]@xmath82    -v_n & 0 & v_{n-1 } \\\\[0.5em ]    0 & -2v_n   & \\la\\end{pmatrix}.\\ ] ] it is not a problem to find the matrices for the general case @xmath83 , but they are more cumbersome . fortunately , we will not need them , since one of the vector lattices exists only in the case @xmath50 anyway , and for the second one this assumption does not lead to the loss of generality ( see section [ s.v2 ] ) .",
    "the block matrices for the vector lattices are derived from here under the `` proper '' interpretation of @xmath12 as a vector - valued quantity . to make notation more clear we toggle to the upper case for the vectors .",

    "this brings the symmetry to the form of the vector generalization of kaup - newell system @xmath178 analogously , the commuting flows for the second vector lattice are @xmath179 and the associated evolution system reads @xmath180 which is another vector analog of kaup - newell system .    another interesting type of associated systems is obtained for the scalar quantities @xmath181 which satisfy , in virtue of any of the pair ( [ v1.t ] ) or ( [ v2.t ] ) one and the same two - dimensional modified volterra lattice @xmath182 it can be written in the form @xmath183 as well , where @xmath184 . these lattices are closely related to mikhailov lattices introduced in @xcite .",
    "the lattices ( [ v1.t ] ) , ( [ v2.t ] ) can be effectively used for the construction of particular solutions of the systems ( [ v1.uv ] ) , ( [ v2.uv ] ) and the lattice ( [ 2dv ] ) . along with the construction method of the soliton - type solutions described above",
    ", one can use to this end the periodic closure @xmath185 with orthogonal operator @xmath126 which leads to the finite - dimensional dynamical systems .",
    "remind that the classification problem of scalar integrable lattices of volterra type was solved by yamilov @xcite within the symmetry approach .",
    "recently one of the authors has obtained an analogous classification of the vector volterra lattices on the sphere , that is under the constraint @xmath186 @xcite .",
    "this constraint essentially simplifies the problem which is very complicated and remains open for the case of free space .",
    "other simplifying assumptions can be used of course , for example the polynomiality of the lattice .",
    "it should be noted that in the continuous case very many polynomial equations are known ; we mention only the papers @xcite which contain the examples and some classification results for the vector systems of derivative nonlinear schrdinger type , equations ( [ v1.uv ] ) , ( [ v2.uv ] ) being just two instances of such systems . in the discrete case , however , the polynomiality is not too natural assumption , as one can see already from the yamilov list of scalar lattices . in the vector",
    "setting we have not succeeded in finding another polynomial volterra type lattices possessing higher symmetries aside from ( [ v1.vx ] ) , ( [ v2.ux ] ) .",
    "our search of integrable lattices was based on the straightforward method of undetermined coefficients . in the simplest case",
    "the lattice and its symmetry are of the form @xmath187 where the scalar coefficients @xmath188 are linear with respect to the scalar products of @xmath173 , @xmath189 , @xmath174 and @xmath190 are quadratic with respect to the scalar products of @xmath191 , @xmath192 .",
    "it is easy to find that the homogeneous lattice contains 18 parameters and its symmetry contains 600 ones . calculating of the cross derivatives yields a system of bilinear equations for the coefficients .",
    "although this system is very bulky , its solving is , in principle , not difficult since the equations are very overdetermined and sparse ( in particular , a large part of equations is monomial ) .",
    "the answer is the consistent pairs of the lattices ( [ v1.t ] ) and ( [ v2.t ] ) ( there are also few solutions with @xmath193 , but all such lattices can be reduced to the scalar ones and therefore they are not of interest for us ) .    it is clear that the scope of this method in this problem is very restricted .",
    "if one takes the coefficients @xmath188 quadratic with respect to the scalar products and @xmath190 of the fourth degree then the number of unknown parameters in the lattice and its symmetry becomes 63 and 15300 respectively , and even the calculation of the commutator becomes not so trivial task .",
    "this case is still manageable , but with the empty answer .",
    "we also have partially analyzed the case when the lattice is of the second order with respect to the shift in @xmath114 and its symmetry is of the fourth order , that is @xmath194 one may hope that some vector analogs of narita - bogoyavlensky lattice @xcite appear here , more precisely , analogs of some its modification with odd degree of nonlinearity , for example @xmath195 notice that classification of such lattices is not known even in the scalar case . unfortunately , the analogs of narita - bogoyavlensky lattice have not been discovered , however we have found two more lattices relative to volterra lattice : @xmath196 each of these lattices possesses 4-th order symmetry which we do not bring because of their length .",
    "the study of these examples falls beyond the scope of our article .",
    "we only notice that the lattice ( [ v3 ] ) generalizes the second flow of the modified volterra lattice ( [ sc.vt ] ) , so that this flow admits at least three vector analogs .",
    "the question on the number of vector analogs for the higher flows of the hierarchy remains open .",
    "the lattice ( [ v4 ] ) in the scalar case is a modification of the volterra lattice on the `` stretched '' grid : @xmath197 but in the vector case this substitution makes no sense and the lattice ( [ v4 ] ) seems to be an independent object .",
    "the zero curvature representations and bcklund transformations for the lattices ( [ v3 ] ) , ( [ v4 ] ) are not known for now .    summing up",
    ", we may say that the classification of the polynomial lattices of volterra and narita - bogoyavlensky types is a very difficult open problem , probably with very scarce answers .",
    "the alternative approaches to the method of undetermined coefficients are the analysis of the necessary integrability conditions in the form of canonical conservation laws @xcite and the perturbative approach @xcite , however the contemporary state of the theory does not allow to effectively apply them , even in the scalar case ."
