    "the presence of dark matter in the universe is now well established .",
    "its presence has been probed by its gravitational interaction with the visible world such as the rotation curve of spiral galaxies @xcite , gravitational lensing @xcite , and the phenomena of the bullet cluster @xcite . meanwhile",
    ", the amount of dark matter present in the universe has already been measured with an unprecedented accuracy by various satellite borne experiments like wmap @xcite and planck @xcite .",
    "the results of these experiments reveal that our universe has more than 80% of its matter content in the form of dark matter while the remaining part is composed of known baryonic matter .",
    "however , the possible nature of the constituents of dark matter and their interactions with the standard model ( sm ) particles as well as with themselves still remains an enigma .",
    "as the standard model of particle physics does not have any fundamental particle which can play the role of a dark matter candidate , there exist many extensions of sm which can accommodate a single @xcite or multicomponent dark matter scenarios @xcite . out of these different types of dark matter scenarios",
    "the most favourable one is the class of particles known as weakly interacting massive particle or wimp @xcite .",
    "this class of dark matter particles were produced thermally at early stage of the universe and maintained their thermal as well as chemical equilibrium through the interactions with other particles within the thermal plasma . as the universe expanded and cooled down their rates began to decrease and eventually , when the annihilation rate of wimp became less than the expansion rate of the universe , wimp decoupled from the thermal plasma and froze to a particular relic density .",
    "particle nature of wimp can be explored mainly in two possible ways .",
    "first is the method of direct detection , where the information about wimp mass and the nature of its interaction with sm particles can be obtained by measuring the recoil energy of the detector nuclei scattered by the wimp .",
    "there are many ongoing dark matter direct detection experiments such as lux @xcite , xenon1 t @xcite and supercdms @xcite .",
    "however , none of them have observed yet any `` real event '' which is produced by the scattering of dark matter particles with the detector nuclei and have thus placed an upper bound on both the spin independent and spin dependent scattering cross sections of wimp as a function of its mass .",
    "another promising method is the indirect detection of dark matter , where the detection of annihilation products of gravitationally bound dark matter particles within the core of massive celestial objects like the sun , galaxies , galaxy clusters and dwarf galaxies can provide viable information about the particle nature of dark matter .",
    "these annihilation products include high energy neutrinos , gamma - rays and charged cosmic rays ( electrons , positrons , protons and antiprotons ) @xcite . among these annihilation products gamma - rays and neutrinos play an important role as they propagate through these celestial objects unperturbed and thereby directly point towards their sources .",
    "recently , several groups have reported @xcite an excess in gamma - ray flux in the energy range @xmath2 gev by analysing the fermi - lat publicly available data @xcite .",
    "these analyses reveal that the observed gamma - ray flux originates from the inner few degrees around the centre of our milky way galaxy and the nature of this excess gamma - ray spectrum is compatible with that produced by the annihilation of wimp dark matter in the galactic centre ( gc ) region .",
    "although , there are astrophysical explanations of this anomalous gamma - ray excess in terms of unresolved point sources ( e.g. millisecond pulsars ) around the gc @xcite , in this work we consider a dark matter explanation of the gc gamma - ray excess . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have shown that this observed gamma - ray flux can be well explained by an annihilating self - conjugate dark matter of mass around @xmath3 gev with an annihilation cross section @xmath4 @xmath5s for the @xmath6 annihilation channel . in this analysis",
    "they have used an nfw @xcite dark matter halo profile with @xmath7 and local dark matter density @xmath8 gev@xmath9@xmath10 . moreover , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have considered a region where galactic longitude and latitude vary in the range @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively as the region of interest ( roi ) for their analysis .",
    "it is also mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite that the uncertainties in the `` astrophysical j factor '' , due to our poor knowledge about dm halo profile parameters , can change the best fit dm annihilation cross section @xmath13 by a multiplicative factor @xmath14 which varies in the range [ 0.17,5.3 ] .",
    "various particle dark matter models explaining the galactic centre gamma - ray excess are available in refs . @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we consider an extension of the sm where the gauge sector of sm is enhanced by a local @xmath15 gauge group where b and l represent the baryon and lepton numbers respectively . in this model",
    "we have an extra neutral gauge boson @xmath16 as the model lagrangian possesses an additional local @xmath15 gauge invariance . in order to construct an anomaly free theory ,",
    "the model needs three right handed neutrinos with @xmath17 charge equal to @xmath18 .",
    "thus , @xmath17 extension of the sm is a well motivated beyond standard model ( bsm ) theory which can explain the origin of tiny neutrino masses through the type - i seesaw mechanism .",
    "majorana mass terms of these three right handed neutrinos are generated in a gauge invariant way by introducing a sm gauge singlet scalar @xmath19 having @xmath17 charge @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath15 gauge symmetry breaks spontaneously when the scalar field @xmath19 gets a vacuum expectation value @xmath21 , thereby generating mass of the @xmath17 gauge boson @xmath16 and the right handed neutrinos .",
    "the mixing between the neutral components of @xmath19 and the sm higgs doublet @xmath22 produces two physical scalars namely @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath23 is identified as the sm - like higgs boson with mass around 125.5 gev .",
    "the @xmath17 extension of sm @xcite has been explored before in the context of dark matter phenomenology @xcite and baryogenesis in the early universe in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the present work",
    "we have introduced a complex scalar field @xmath25 to the @xmath15 extension of sm .",
    "this complex scalar field @xmath25 is singlet under the sm gauge group while it transforms nontrivially under @xmath15 gauge group . by choosing proper @xmath17 charge ,",
    "this scalar field @xmath25 can be made stable and hence it can play the role of a viable dark matter candidate . in this present work ,",
    "we have considered the low mass region @xmath26 gev to @xmath27 gev of dm masses to explain the fermi - lat gamma - ray excess from the galactic centre , whereas the high mass region has been studied in ref .",
    "we have calculated the relic density of @xmath25 by solving boltzmann equation numerically .",
    "we have found that the gamma - ray flux produced from the annihilation of @xmath25 and @xmath28 can reproduce the gamma - ray excess as observed by fermi - lat from the direction of gc .",
    "moreover , in this work , we have taken into account all the possible existing theoretical as well as experimental constraints obtained from experiments like lhc , lep , lux , planck .",
    "the paper is arranged in the following way . in section [ model ]",
    "we describe the model in detail and discuss the constraints on it from different experiment . in section [ relic ]",
    "we calculate the relic density in this model . in section [ res ]",
    "we show the variation of the relic density with different model parameters . in section [ gammaflux ]",
    "we explain the fermi - lat gamma - ray excess .",
    "finally in section [ summary ] we conclude .",
    "in the present work , we have considered `` pure '' @xmath15 extension of the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particles where the sm gauge group @xmath29 is enhanced by an additional local @xmath15 gauge symmetry where b and l represent the baryon and lepton numbers , respectively .",
    "therefore , all the sm ( quarks and leptons ) fields transform nontrivially under this @xmath15 gauge group . besides the sm fields",
    ", we have to introduce three right handed neutrinos ( @xmath30 to 3 ) such that the present model becomes anomaly free .",
    "further , in addition to the usual sm higgs doublet @xmath22 , the scalar sector of the sm is also extended by adding two sm gauge singlet complex scalar fields , namely @xmath19 , @xmath25 both of which possess nonzero @xmath15 charge .",
    "@xmath15 gauge symmetry breaks spontaneously when the scalar field @xmath19 gets a nonzero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath31 .",
    "consequently , we have one extra neutral massive gauge field @xmath16 in the model . moreover , after spontaneous breaking of @xmath15 symmetry , the majorana mass terms for the three right handed neutrinos can be generated in a gauge invariant way by choosing a suitable @xmath15 charge @xmath20 of the scalar field @xmath19 .",
    "also , if the value of the relevant model parameters are such that the vev of @xmath25 is zero then the complex scalar field @xmath25 can be made stable by giving an appropriate @xmath17 to it . under such circumstances",
    "@xmath25 can be a viable dark matter candidate .",
    "the @xmath15 charges as well as the sm gauge charges of all the fields present in the model are given in a tabular form ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    ".particle content and their corresponding charges under various symmetry groups .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]      +",
    "existence of neutrino masses and dark matter in the universe are two of the main observational evidences for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "if the galactic centre gamma ray excess reported by the fermi - lat data is indeed due to dm annihilation , then we need our beyond sm physics to be able to explain this excess along with the observed dm relic density as well as neutrino masses and mixing . in this work we showed that the gauged @xmath15 extension of the standard model , which can very naturally explain lepton number violation and hence the existence of small majorana neutrino masses , can also be extended to explain the relic dm density and the fermi - lat gamma ray excess , without conflicting with any existing theoretical or observational constraint .",
    "since @xmath15 symmetry that we impose is local , there is an additional gauge boson @xmath16 in this model .",
    "three right handed neutrinos also have to included in the model to make it anomaly free . in order to break the @xmath15 symmetry spontaneously",
    ", one introduces an extra sm singlet scalar @xmath19 which carries a nontrivial @xmath17 charge .",
    "the @xmath17 charge of this scalar can be arranged in such a way that the right handed neutrinos pick up majorana masses when @xmath19 gets a vev , breaking the @xmath15 symmetry spontaneously . as a result",
    "the @xmath16 gauge boson also becomes massive .",
    "this extra neutral gauge boson has been searched for at collider experiments which put a stringent bound on the combination of the new @xmath15 gauge coupling and the mass of @xmath16 .",
    "we extended this gauged @xmath15 model further by adding another complex sm scalar @xmath25 which is charged under @xmath15 and arranged its @xmath15 charge in such away that all decays of @xmath25 are forbidden making it a stable dm candidate .",
    "we next studied the viability of this model in simultaneously explaining the relic dm density of the universe as well as the gc gamma ray excess through the annihilation of @xmath25 and @xmath32 into the @xmath33 channel , mediated by @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath16 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the two neutral scalars in our model , of which we identified @xmath23 as the sm - like higgs with its mass fixed at 125.5 gev .",
    "there are 12 unknown new parameters in this model .",
    "we imposed constraints coming from vacuum stability , lep bound on @xmath34 , lhc bounds on signal strength of the sm - like higgs and invisible decay width of the sm - like higgs , and found the regions of the model parameter space which can simultaneously explain the observed dm relic density as well as the fermi - lat gc gamma ray excess and at the same time evaded the bounds from the direct detection experiments such as lux .",
    "we showed that for dm masses in the range 40 - 55 gev and for a wide range of @xmath0 gauge boson masses , one can satisfy all these constraints if the additional neutral higgs scalar has a mass around the resonance region .",
    "we presented allowed areas in the model parameter space consistent with all relevant data , calculated the predicted gamma ray flux from the gc and discussed the related phenomenology .    in conclusion ,",
    "the observation of neutrino masses and dark matter are the two main observational evidences of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the small neutrino masses can be explained in terms of lepton number violation and the gauged @xmath0 extension of the standard model can very easily accommodate the type - i seesaw mechanism since it must have three additional right - handed neutrinos for anomaly cancellation and light majorana neutrino masses are generated through this seesaw mechanism when the @xmath0 is broken spontaneously .",
    "we propose an extension of this model by adding a complex scalar field @xmath25 that acts as the dark matter candidate and make it stable by arranging suitably its @xmath15 charge .",
    "we showed that both the relic abundance and the galactic centre gamma ray excess could be explained in this model .",
    "thus this model can simultaneously explain neutrino masses , the dark matter relic density of the universe and the gc gamma ray excess , while simultaneously satisfying all other collider and direct detection constraints .",
    "this model should be testable at the next - generation xenon1 t experiment .",
