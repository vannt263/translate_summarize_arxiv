    "quantum entanglement is a necessary resource for quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum computation @xcite .",

    "certification of the entanglement of a state requires fidelity calculation . to further characterize the entanglement of a quantum state",
    ", an identical density matrix is an indispensable tool .",
    "determination of this unique density matrix requires quantum measurements . due to the characteristics of the destructiveness of the photon measurement , many copies of this unknown state are prepared to realize the quantum measurement .",
    "so far , it has been a challenge to prepare enough samples of the entangled state for detecting multi - photon entanglement in experiment @xcite . therefore a scheme is required which consumes copies of a state as few as possible and thus making the prepared copies of the state are sufficient to confirm entanglement or reconstruct a density matrix .",
    "the whole process to reconstruct the density matrix is named as quantum state tomography ( qst ) @xcite .",
    "specifically , the number of counts corresponding to different positive operator - valued measures ( povms ) is gained by repeatedly measuring the copies of a state .",
    "the ratio of the number of counts in one basis to the number of all counts detected in the same measurement setting is defined as a relative frequency , which can be obtained when the number of copies of the state is large enough .",
    "the relative frequencies are approximately regarded as probabilities .",
    "this measurement process follows born s rule @xcite .",
    "then these probabilities can determine a density matrix by inverse transformation .    in qst",
    ", three main problems are encountered .",
    "i , several best measurement settings are required to be chosen for estimating the density matrix .",
    "platonic solid measurements ( the measurement bases are the vectors that connect the centers of the faces of the platonic solid and the center point in the bloch sphere ) give good performance of the reconstruction , and the overcomplete measurement sets can be commonly used to improve the accuracy of tomographic reconstruction @xcite . however , these theoretical results are not easily accomplished in experiment , since the platonic solid measurements of overcomplete sets takes too much time in tomography .",
    "ii , based on the measurement results ( relative frequencies ) , it requires much time to reconstruct a multi - qubit density matrix .",
    "hence , efficient algorithms are required to reconstruct a density matrix , the algorithms such as maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimation and the least squares ( ls ) method are commonly applied to qst @xcite .",
    "recently , compressive sensing ( cs ) is also utilized to conduct tomography @xcite .",
    "its performance is compared with ml in experiment @xcite , which shows that ml is better than cs .",
    "however , the conclusion may be taken with due care since the property of a density matrix is considered as the constraint of ml while it is not taken into account in the cs .",
    "besides , a numerical result shows that cs outperforms ls when sampling rate is low @xcite , while the opposite is true when sampling rate is high @xcite .",
    "based on the special characteristics of povms , phaselift is a good approach to save the storage space of povms , and has been also applied to solve a density matrix when the state is close to a pure state @xcite .",
    "iii , the number of copies of an unknown state measured in each setting may not be equal .",
    "identical copies of the arbitrary unknown quantum state are evenly distributed in each measurement setting in general tomography experiments . however , the required copies of a state increase sharply with the dimensions of the hilbert space for the quantum states .",
    "therefore a scheme needs to be explored to cut down a required number of copies of the unknown state in qst .",
    "recently , the adaptive qst is proposed to solve this problem @xcite .",
    "it divides the measurement into two steps .",
    "the first step is to get a preliminary density matrix and the second step is to correct it by measurements of the diagonal basis of the density matrix obtained previously @xcite .",
    "it reduces the infidelity between the estimated and the true state from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the total number of samples of the unknown state @xcite .",
    "this idea is further substantiated by one - qubit experiment @xcite .",
    "the density matrix is reconstructed twice in the experiment .    in this paper , we improve the adaptive qst by reconstructing the density matrix three times by applying different distribution schemes of the copies of the unknown state in the second and third steps of measurements .",
    "specifically , phaselift is applied to decrease the storage space of povms and we optimize the parameters by numerical simulation , such as the proportion of samples of an unknown state between the first step and the second step .",
    "a distribution scheme of copies of an unknown state for different settings is also developed , which helps to cut down the total number of copies of the state .",
    "the three - step adaptive qst is proposed to reduce the mean square error ( mse ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 and section 3 , phaselift and its connection with quantum state tomography",
    "are discussed .",
    "we are interested in applying the phaselift to adaptive quantum state tomography . in section 4",
    ", a new scheme is proposed to distribute different number of copies of a state into different settings . in section 5 ,",
    "the numerical plots of the adaptive quantum state tomography via phaselift are given , and the three - step adaptive quantum state is compared with the conventional fixed quantum state tomography .    in the following part , various letters are used to represent different physical quantities .",
    "let @xmath4 be the total number of copies of a state , @xmath5 denote the number of qubits , @xmath6 express the ratio of the number of copies of a state costed in the first step to the total number , @xmath7 represent a true unknown density matrix , @xmath8 indicate the density matrix estimated in the first step and @xmath9 be the final estimated density matrix .",
    "let @xmath10 be the ratio of the number of copies of a state costed in the third round of measurement to the total number .",
    "phaselift is an approach to recover an unknown vector from several different measurements @xcite .",
    "let @xmath11 represent a general density matrix .",
    "when @xmath11 is a pure state , it can be decomposed as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and the superscript @xmath14 indicates complex conjugate transpose .",
    "let @xmath15 denote different settings , @xmath16 is used to distinguish different bases in a setting .",
    "hence the povms corresponding to the @xmath16-th bases of the @xmath15-th setting can be described as @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath17 also can be decomposed as @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , then we have @xmath20 from ref.@xcite , all the entries in @xmath21 can be recovered in the same phase difference . however , it has no effect on @xmath11 since the phase difference is eliminated in @xmath12",
    ". then the optimization model of the density matrix is constructed based upon the procedures given in refs.@xcite ; and the noise is considered @xcite .",
    "@xmath22 where @xmath23 is the frequency in the @xmath16th base of the @xmath15th setting and @xmath11 is the unknown density matrix , which is a positive semi - definite , and self - adjoint operator with trace equal to unity .",
    "this approach is applied to estimate the density matrix in the following work .",
    "the principle of adaptive quantum state tomography ( aqst ) is as follows : the copies of an unknown state @xmath7 is divided into two parts .",
    "one is used to estimate a density matrix @xmath8 , the other is used to adjust it .",
    "specifically , a rough density matrix @xmath8 is initially estimated by the uniform distribution of a part of the samples of @xmath7 in the all measurement settings . then based on the characteristics of @xmath8 , only a part of settings",
    "are selected for the remaining measurements . from the measurement frequencies ,",
    "a density matrix @xmath24 is estimated by considering the previous measurement frequencies @xcite .",
    "we improve aqst by proposing a scheme to select the best settings and applying phaselift to obtain the density matrix .",
    "firstly pauli measurement is applied in our simulation .",
    "hence the total number of settings is @xmath25 for @xmath5-qubit system , and @xmath15 is an integer between @xmath26 and @xmath25 .",
    "the superscript @xmath27 indicates the first round of measurements .",
    "then the frequency in the @xmath16-th base of the @xmath15-th setting in the first round of measurements can be described as @xmath28 , which is obtained by measuring copies of @xmath7 with the number of @xmath29 on the povms .",
    "then a roughly estimated density matrix @xmath8 can be given via phaselift by inputting @xmath28 .",
    "the new scheme is applied to select measurement settings and to properly assign the remaining copies of @xmath7 to the selected settings in the second round of measurements . based on the count distributions ,",
    "the relative frequencies @xmath30 are gained in the chosen settings . by forming linear combinations of the former frequencies",
    "@xmath28 , the new relative frequencies @xmath30 , @xmath31 are obtained .",
    "finally , a new density matrix @xmath9 can be obtained by inputting these new frequencies @xmath31 into phaselift , as shown in fig.[shiyituer ] .     the process of adaptive qst .",
    "the copy of unknown state @xmath32 is represented by purple downward spiral line .",
    "traditional adaptive qst is to split the total number of copies of unknown state , n , into two part .",
    "one costs 1/3 of the total copies of the state , the other costs 2/3 of the total copies of the state . from the first part , a preliminary density matrix @xmath8 ( represented by green downward spiral line )",
    "is obtained .",
    "then based on the measurement results from the other part , @xmath24 represented by red downward spiral line is obtained.,width=453 ]",
    "after obtaining @xmath8 in the first round of measurements on the pauli bases , the new mechanism for getting a more accurate density matrix @xmath24 is described in detail in this section . its purpose is to select the distribution of the number of copies of an unknown state @xmath7 in the different settings for the second round of measurements .",
    "since @xmath33 copies of @xmath7 are consumed in the first round of measurements , the remaining copies of @xmath7 have the number @xmath34 which are used to reduce the error of each entry of the density matrix @xmath8 as much as possible .",
    "since the error caused by an entry with large modulus is also big @xcite , a large number of samples of @xmath7 are required to reduce the errors of these entries .",
    "then mean square error ( mse ) between @xmath7 and @xmath9 can be relatively small .",
    "in other words , a portion of measurement settings is selected to ensure that their bases are enough to uniquely decompose the density matrix .",
    "if the coefficient of a basis in the decomposition is relatively large , it means that the basis for determining the unknown density matrix is more important or it has a much larger contribution to cause the deviation of the desired density matrix @xcite .",
    "hence , more than the average number of copies of the unknown state @xmath7 is expected to be distributed on these bases .",
    "the coefficients are obtained by decomposing the roughly estimated density matrix @xmath8 .",
    "the summation of coefficients of the bases in the same setting determines the number of samples of @xmath7 used for each setting in the second round of measurement .",
    "the coefficients and the number of samples are chosen to be linear proportional .",
    "specifically , let @xmath35 be such a vector that each entry @xmath36 of @xmath35 is the coefficient of the @xmath16th basis of the @xmath15th settings ( @xmath17 ) , then the summation of coefficient in the same setting is @xmath37 .",
    "the purpose of this mechanism is to find out the measurement settings as small as possible and the bases belong to these settings are sufficient to uniquely decompose the density matrix @xmath11 .",
    "since @xmath11 is a positive semidefinite matrix , the following model is proposed to select settings based on the above principle .",
    "@xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is a vector whose elements are the bases of different measurement settings .",
    "usually these bases can be either the bases of all different pauli operators or mutually unbiased bases @xcite . here the bases of all different pauli operators are applied for numerical tests since they are much easier to utilize in experiment @xcite .",
    "then eigen - vectors can be calculated for each tensor product of pauli operators .",
    "specifically , the local pauli operator @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 are applied .",
    "let @xmath44 and @xmath45 denote the two eigen - vectors of @xmath41 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath42 , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath43 .",
    "then the elements of @xmath40 for the two - qubit case are as follows : @xmath50 to facilitate the solution , the model of eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) is transformed into the following form : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a maximum allowed error and set to 0.00001 in the following numerical simulation . since @xmath35 can be obtained from the model of eq.([selectioner ] ) , then the remaining copies of the unknown state @xmath7 with the number of @xmath53 are allocated according to @xmath35 . the rule to allocate the copies of the unknown state @xmath7",
    "is based on the summation of coefficients of the bases belonging to the same setting .",
    "more copies of the unknown state @xmath7 need to be measured when the value is large .",
    "in other words , the following rule is proposed for copies distribution .",
    "@xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the number of copies of the unknown state @xmath7 for the @xmath15-th setting .",
    "relative frequency of the second round of measurement @xmath30 can be obtained after measuring samples @xmath7 with the number of @xmath56 on the povms @xmath17 .",
    "the superscript @xmath57 in @xmath30 represents the second round of measurement .",
    "sparse property of the density matrix is taken as a priori . since the frequencies corresponding to cases where povms measure the zero entries of a sparse density matrix or their linear combination are zero if there is no noise .",
    "however , some noise always exists , therefore , the frequency for this kind of povms is a little larger than zero in practical measurements . because the summation of frequencies for all the bases in the same setting are always equal to one , the povms measuring the non - zero entries of a sparse density matrix may correspond to a relatively larger frequency than the detected one ( @xmath30 )",
    "therefore , @xmath30 corresponding to the large coefficient @xmath58 of the setting is adjusted to a slightly larger value by a factor @xmath59 , then the relative frequency @xmath31 takes the form @xmath60 then @xmath31 is used to get a more precise density matrix @xmath24 by applying phaselift once again , as shown in fig.[shiyituer ] .    to further improve the reconstructed density matrix ,",
    "the three - step aqst is developed .",
    "the difference between two - step and three - step aqst is that the density matrix @xmath8 is revised twice in three - step aqst while the density matrix @xmath8 is amended only once in two - step aqst by using the same number of copies of unknown state @xmath32 . in other words ,",
    "the copies of unknown state @xmath32 for the second step of measurement in two - step aqst is divided into two parts in three - step aqst , one is applied to get a little precise density matrix @xmath61 than @xmath8 . then based on the @xmath61 , the other part of copies of @xmath32 is measured to further revise the @xmath61 to get a more precise @xmath24 , as shown in fig.[flowcharter ] and fig.[shiyituerthreestep ] .",
    "the @xmath62 can be calculated by the density matrix @xmath61 : @xmath63 based on the same idea of taking sparsity as a priori , the frequency gets modified again , @xmath64 then @xmath65 is applied to obtain @xmath24 by phaselift , therefore @xmath24 is the finial density matrix .",

    "is obtained .",
    "combined with the results measured by the second part of copies of the state , a better density matrix @xmath61 represented by brown downward spiral line is obtained .",

    "several states are selected for numerical simulations .",

    "three - step aqst outperforms two - step aqst.,width=377 ]",
    "frequency adjustment of eq.([fum ] ) is suitable to some special `` sparse state '' as is seen from the results of a large number of numerical simulations . in fig.[sc ] and fig.[g9 ] , the tested matrices are sparse .",
    "a sparse matrix means many zero entries in the density matrix , such as the pure sc state .",
    "it is also observed that the larger the gap between the modules of different elements in the true density matrix @xmath7 , the better aqst performs under our mechanism of applying specific selection .",
    "the essence of the mechanism is to use the characteristics of the sparsity of the density matrix in the partial basis .",
    "fixed qst is assigned to the same number of copies of @xmath7 on each measurement setting .",
    "hence the prior information of the density matrix is not utilized .",
    "in contrast , aqst exploits the rough information about the magnitude of each element of the preliminary density matrix , which is obtained using the partial copies of the unknown state @xmath7 .",
    "the remaining samples of @xmath7 are better exploited because of the information provided by this rough density matrix .",
    "the reason why we use aqst is briefly stated as follows : the error of an entry of the density matrix becomes larger when the magnitude of the entry becomes larger but not exceeding 1/2 ( and the cases of the magnitude exceeding 1/2 is very rare practically ) ; this fact is obtained from eq.(4 ) in ref.@xcite .",
    "this implies that the treatment of the remaining copies of the unknown state @xmath7 as distributed uniformly in the measurement settings is not the best choice . in order to reduce the big errors associated with the entries with large magnitude",
    ", we may distribute more copies of the unknown state @xmath7 in the settings that contain bases which the projected value of @xmath7 onto the bases is large .",
    "then the total error in the density matrix , which is described by mse , can be made smaller . in this paper",
    ", only mse is utilized to compare the performance of aqst with that of the fixed tomography .",
    "more physical quantities , such as fidelity , are required to fully compare these methods .",
    "in addition , four - step aqst , or aqst with even more steps is not considered since the mse provided by three - step is small enough to meet the requirement of qst and too many steps also means to reconstruct density matrix for many times , which will cost much time .",
    "the purpose of allocation mechanism of the copy of a state is to obtain the density matrix as exactly as possible .",
    "our results are especially favorable for multi - photon systems .",
    "the preparation of a large number of samples in short time is very challenging .",
    "eight - photon system requires 170 hours to prepare a reasonable number of copies of the eight - photon sc state , which are just enough to certify the entanglement of these copies @xcite .",
    "further characterization of the quantum state in experiment meets even more difficulties , and the current experimental technology is not up to the requirements .",
    "in addition , it is also difficult to obtain the density matrix of large dimension by the inversion of relative frequencies obtained for povms according to the born s rule in a short period of time .",
    "it will also take up a lot of storage space for povms in a computer .",
    "so based on the characteristics of povms , phaselift saves the huge storage space ; the occupied space has been reduced from @xmath86 to @xmath87 .",
    "the multi - step aqst via phaselift may be extended to quantum process tomography under some conditions in the near future .",
    "in aqst , a new scheme to distribute the copies of a state in different settings is developed based on the priori that some settings have more contributions to exactly estimate the density matrix .",
    "in addition , phaselift is applied to reconstruct the density matrix by saving the memory space required by the computer . by this new scheme with phaselift",
    ", a much more accurate density matrix can be obtained .",
    "the three - step aqst is also studied . by comparing their mse , both the two - step and three - step aqst",
    "are shown to have a much better performance than the fixed qst .",
