    "two - body nonleptonic @xmath0 meson decays have attracted great attention recently .",

    "the mechanism responsible for the very different @xmath4 and @xmath5 branching ratios is still unclear .",
    "it has been speculated that the long - distance resonant contribution through the nearby resonance @xmath13 in the @xmath14-exchange topology could explain why a @xmath15 meson decays more abundantly to the @xmath16 than @xmath17 final state @xcite : it is attributed to the dominance of the scalar glueball content in @xmath13 and the chiral suppression on the scalar glueball decay into two pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "this mechanism was systematically formulated in the single pole - dominance model with additional arbitrary  wilson coefficients \" , and then included into the topology parametrization for global fits @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the predicted @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) branching ratio remains higher ( lower ) than the data .",
    "that is , a systematic and global understanding of the @xmath1 decays has not existed yet . because of the high precision of the two data , even a small deviation deteriorates the global fit . if the branching ratios are not well explained , some important decay mechanism may be still missing , and any predictions for the direct cp asymmetries are not convincing .    for the second puzzle ,",
    "a reliable evaluation of the penguin contributions to two - body nonleptonic @xmath0 meson decays is not available so far . in @xcite",
    "the tree amplitudes were determined by fitting the topology parametrization to the data of the branching ratios , while the penguin amplitudes were calculated in the qcd - improved factorization ( qcdf ) @xcite .",
    "that is , the tree and penguin contributions were treated in the different theoretical frameworks .",
    "it has been noticed that the penguin amplitudes derived from qcdf lead to a tiny @xmath11 of order @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "allowing the penguin amplitudes to be of the same order as the tree ones discretionally , @xmath11 reaches @xmath19 @xcite . in another work @xcite",
    "also based on the topology parametrization , the penguin contribution via an internal @xmath20 quark was identified as the major source of cp violation , since it can not be related to the tree amplitudes .",
    "this penguin contribution , including its strong phase , was constrained by the lhcb data , and then adopted to predict direct cp asymmetries of other decay modes . in this way",
    "it is difficult to tell whether the large @xmath21 in eqs .",
    "( [ lhcb ] ) and ( [ cdfn ] ) arise from new physics @xcite .",
    "the similar comment applies to the analysis in @xcite .",
    "viewing that the postulated @xmath11 ranges from @xmath18 to @xmath22 in the sm @xcite , it is crucial to give precise predictions for the direct cp asymmetries in the @xmath1 decays .    in this paper",
    "we aim at proposing a theoretical framework , in which various contributions , such as emission and annihilation ones , and tree and penguin ones are all handled consistently .",
    "the only assumption involved is the factorization of short - distance dynamics and long - distance dynamics in two - body nonleptonic @xmath0 meson decays into wilson coefficients and hadronic matrix elements of four - fermion operators , respectively .",
    "for the hadronic matrix elements , including the emission , @xmath14-annihilation , and @xmath14-exchange amplitudes , the treatment is similar to the topology parametrization in the factorization hypothesis .",
    "the quark - loop and magnetic penguin contributions are absorbed into the wilson coefficients for the penguin operators .",
    "as to the scale of the wilson coefficients , we set it to the energy release in individual decay modes , which depends on masses of final states .",
    "an important ingredient is the glauber strong phase factor @xcite associated with a pion , whose strength has been constrained by the data of the @xmath23 direct cp asymmetries @xcite .",
    "briefly speaking , we have improved the topology parametrization by taking into account mode - dependent qcd dynamics , for instance , flavor @xmath7 symmetry breaking effects , in two - body nonleptonic @xmath0 meson decays .    due to the small charm quark mass @xmath24 gev",
    ", a perturbative theory may not be valid for @xmath0 meson decays .",
    "however , with the abundant data , all the above hadronic parameters can be determined .",
    "it will be shown that the glauber phase associated with a pion is crucial for understanding the @xmath4 branching ratio very different from the @xmath5 one .",
    "this additional phase modifies the relative angle and the interference between the emission and annihilation amplitudes involving pions .",
    "the predicted @xmath4 branching ratio is then reduced , while the predicted @xmath25 branching ratio is enhanced , such that the overall agreement with the data is greatly improved . our scale choice for the wilson coefficients impacts the @xmath1 decays containing the @xmath3 meson in the final states : the @xmath3 meson mass about 1 gev is not negligible compared to the @xmath0 meson mass , so the energy release in these modes should be lower . once the hadronic parameters are fixed by the measured branching ratios , the penguin amplitudes , expressed as the combination of the hadronic parameters and the corresponding wilson coefficients , are also fixed in our framework .",
    "that is , we can predict the direct cp asymmetries of the @xmath1 decays in the sm without ambiguity . in particular , we obtain @xmath26 , which discriminates the opposite postulations on large ( small ) direct cp asymmetries in singly cabibbo - suppressed @xmath0 meson decays @xcite ( @xcite ) .",
    "it will be observed that the quark loops and the scalar penguin annihilation generate large relative phases between the tree and penguin amplitudes , and are the dominant sources of the direct cp asymmetries .    in sec .",

    "[ fig : topo ] .",
    "penguin contributions are neglected for branching ratios due to the suppression of the ckm matrix elements @xmath48 . besides",
    ", there exist flavor - singlet amplitudes , in which a quark - antiquark pair produced from vacuum generates color- and flavor - singlet states like @xmath49 .",

    "the thick line represents the charm quark . ]",
    "it is known that the heavy quark expansion does not work well for charm decays because of the small @xmath50 , so that nonfactorizable contributions , such as vertex corrections , final - state interaction ( fsi ) , resonance effects , etc , can not be ignored , especially in the amplitude @xmath45 .",
    "we parameterize these contributions into a factor @xmath51 . for simplicity",

    ", there exists a relative strong phase @xmath52 between @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which may arise from inelastic fsi or other long - distance dynamics in @xmath0 meson decays @xcite .",
    "therefore , the emission amplitudes @xmath44 and @xmath45 are parameterized as @xmath53 with the @xmath54 ( @xmath43 ) meson mass @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , the @xmath43 meson decay constant @xmath57 , and the @xmath58 transition form factor @xmath59 .",

    "the flavor @xmath7 symmetry breaking effects have been known to be significant in the @xmath1 decays , especially in the singly cabibbo - suppressed modes @xcite . in additional to the different decay constants @xmath57 and form factors @xmath59 , the mass ratios @xmath62 should be distinguished too , with @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 being the masses of the kaon , the @xmath49 meson , and the @xmath0 meson , respectively . as suggested in the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach @xcite , the scale @xmath31 is set to the energy release in individual decay processes , which depends on final - state masses .",
    "we propose the choice = , [ scale ] where @xmath66 is the mass ratio of the @xmath43 meson over the @xmath0 meson , and @xmath67 , representing the momentum of soft degrees of freedom in the @xmath0 meson , is a free parameter .",
    "the evolution of the wilson coefficients in the scale @xmath31 is shown in appendix [ app : wc ] .",
    "the above choice further takes into account the @xmath7 breaking effect in the wilson coefficients for the emission amplitudes .",
    "it is then legitimate to regard @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath67 as being universal to all modes , which will be determined by experimental data .    the @xmath68 branching ratio through the pure @xmath14-exchange channel vanishes in the @xmath7 limit due to the cancelation of the ckm matrix elements @xcite",
    "hence , the large observed branching ratio of this mode manifests the breaking of the flavor @xmath7 symmetry in the @xmath14-exchange contribution , which becomes almost of the same order as the emission one .",
    "both the @xmath14-exchange topology for neutral @xmath0 meson decays and the @xmath14-annihilation topology for charged @xmath0 meson decays will be included in our framework .",
    "since the factorizable contributions to these amplitudes are down by the helicity suppression , we consider only the nonfactorizable contributions .",
    "then the former ( latter ) is proportional to the wilson coefficient @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "based on the above reasoning , we parameterize the amplitudes @xmath46 and @xmath47 as @xmath71 with the factors [ b ] & & b_q , s^e()= c_2 ( ) _ q , s^e e^i_q , s^e , + & & b_q , s^a()= c_1 ( ) _ q , s^a e^i_q , s^a . the dimensionless parameters @xmath72 and",
    "@xmath73 describe the strengths and the strong phases of the involved matrix elements , where the superscripts @xmath74 differentiate the light quarks and the strange quarks strongly produced in pairs .",
    "the @xmath20 s are defined for the @xmath75 final states , to which those for other final states are related via the ratio of the decay constants @xmath76 .",
    "that is , the flavor @xmath7 breaking effects from the strongly produced quark pairs and from the decay constants have been taken into account .",
    "the parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 are then assumed to be universal , and will be determined from data .",
    "similarly , we consider the @xmath7 breaking effect in the energy release , which defines the scale of the wilson coefficients @xmath77 = , with the mass ratios @xmath78 .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , a special type of soft gluons , called the glauber gluons , may introduce an additional strong phase to a nonfactorizable amplitude in two - body heavy - meson decays . the glauber phase associated with a pion",
    "is more significant , because of its simultaneous role as a nambu - goldstone boson and a @xmath79 bound state : the valence quark and anti - quark of the pion are separated by a short distance in order to reduce the confinement potential energy , while the multi - parton states of the pion spread over a huge space - time in order to meet the role of a massless nambu - goldstone boson @xcite . the relatively larger soft effect from the multi - parton states in the pion results in the glauber phase .",
    "hence , we assign a phase factor @xmath80 for each pion involved in the nonfactorizable amplitudes @xmath46 and @xmath47 . the phase factor associated with the @xmath75 final states",
    "is then given by @xmath81 as explicitly shown in appendix  [ app : amp ] .",
    "the reason why we do not introduce the glauber phase into the nonfactorizable emission diagrams , but only into the @xmath14-exchange and @xmath14-annihilation diagrams is that the emission topology mainly receives factorizable contributions in most of the decay modes .",
    "since the glauber phase appears only in nonfactorizable amplitudes , we will not include it into the emission topology in the present work .    in summary , our parametrization for the emission amplitudes in eq .",

    "this scale , which is not very low , indicates that the pqcd factorization formulas @xcite might provide a useful guideline for formulating various contributions to the @xmath1 decays in our framework .",

    "at this moment , there is plenty of room for accommodating the lhcb and cdf data by means of models extended beyond the sm .",

    "new physics effects on the direct cp asymmetries in @xmath1 decays can be explored by combining corresponding short - distance wilson coefficients with the long - distance parameters determined in this work .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a theoretical framework for analyzing two - body nonleptonic @xmath0 meson decays , based on the factorization of short - distance ( long - distance ) dynamics into wilson coefficients ( hadronic matrix elements of four - fermion operators ) . because of the small charm quark mass just above 1 gev , a perturbative theory for the hadronic matrix elements may not be valid .",
    "our idea is to identify as complete as possible the important sources of nonperturbative dynamics in the decay amplitudes , and parameterize them in the framework of the factorization hypothesis : we have considered the evolution of the wilson coefficients with the energy release in individual decay modes , which depends on the scale @xmath67 of the soft degrees of freedom in the @xmath0 meson .",
    "the hadronic matrix elements of the four - fermion operators have been parameterized into the strengths @xmath107 s and the strong phases @xmath52 s .",
    "it is crucial to introduce the glauber strong phase @xmath108 associated with a pion in the nonfactorizable annihilation amplitudes , which is due to the unique role of the pion as a nambu - goldstone boson and a quark - anti - quark bound state simultaneously .",

    "fitting our parametrization to the abundant data of the @xmath1 branching ratios , all the nonperturbative parameters have been determined .",

    "the glauber phase has also enhanced the predicted @xmath25 branching ratio , giving much better consistency with the data .",
    "the value of @xmath67 is in the correct order of magnitude for characterizing the soft degrees of freedom in the @xmath0 meson , and the glauber phase @xmath108 agrees with that extracted from the data for the direct cp asymmetries in the @xmath109 decays .",
    "the similarity of the @xmath107 values for the @xmath14-exchange and for the @xmath14-annihilation conforms our expectation , because these two topologies can be converted to each other via the fierz transformation .",
    "the difference between the @xmath107 values for the strongly produced light - quark and strange - quark pairs implies the significant @xmath7 breaking effects in the @xmath1 decays .",
    "once having determined the nonperturbative parameters from the fit to the branching ratios , the replacement of the wilson coefficients works for estimating the penguin contributions .",
    "for those penguin amplitudes , which can not be related to tree amplitudes through the above replacement , we have shown that they are either factorizable or suppressed by the helicity conservation .",
    "if they are factorizable , such as the scalar penguin annihilation contribution , data from other processes can be used for their determination .",
    "we are then able to predict the direct cp asymmetries in @xmath1 decays without ambiguity .",
