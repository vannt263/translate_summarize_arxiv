    "conformal defects or interfaces in a conformal field theory are a kind of generalizations of conformal boundary conditions@xcite .",
    "they describe the universality classes of the domain wall at which two different or same conformal field theories are connected .",
    "these conformal defects appear several different contexts in physics .",
    "they describe impurities in condensed matter physics .",
    "they also appear in the string theory ; in ads / cft correspondence some branes in ads spacetime correspond to defects in conformal field theory ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "partial list of recent works on the conformal defects includes @xcite .",
    "one of the main tools to investigate conformal defects is the folding trick@xcite . by this prescription ,",
    "the problem is mapped into the conformal boundary problem in the direct product theory .",
    "however it is not easy to get the classification of the boundary states in the folded theory even if the original theory is two minimal models .",
    "this is because the product of two minimal models is not a minimal model in general , and the conformal boundary problem is not soluble in general .",
    "the systematic ways to treat these boundary states are limited .",
    "one way is to consider the tensor products of the boundary states in each side .",
    "these tensor product states are classified because the conformal boundaries in minimal models are classified@xcite .",
    "these tensor product states are purely reflective defects in the unfolded theory .",
    "the other way is to consider the permutation boundary states@xcite when two cfts in each sides are the same .",
    "these states are purely transmissive defects ( topological defects ) in the unfolded theory .",
    "therefore it is not easy in general to obtain the defects which are not purely reflective or purely transmissive .",
    "there are a few exceptions .",
    "for example conformal defects between two critical ising models are mapped into conformal boundaries of certain @xmath3 cft@xcite .",
    "this boundary problem is actually solved .",
    "there are a few more examples in which the conformal defects problem can be systematically treated@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address defects between two tricritical ising models@xcite .",
    "the tricritical ising model has @xmath0 superconformal symmetry .",
    "actually it is the first model of the @xmath0 superconformal unitary minimal series ( @xmath4 in eq . ) .",
    "the direct product of two tricritical ising models is not a minimal model , so it is difficult to classify all the conformal defects .",
    "however , when we require superconformal symmetry , the situation changes .",
    "the direct product of two tricritical ising models with spin structure aligned is again a @xmath0 superconformal minimal model : @xmath1 ( @xmath5 in eq . )",
    "@xmath2 modular invariant theory .",
    "thus we can treat this problem systematically .    at first sight ,",
    "one seems to be able to solve the superconformal defect problem by just classifying the conformal boundary in this auxiliary theory using the cardy condition@xcite .",
    "however it turns out not to work .",
    "there is no `` no defect '' boundary state in this classification which is expected to exist .    in this paper",
    ", we employ the following two as the criteria for the consistent set of superconformal defects .    1 .",
    "it includes `` no defect . ''",
    "it satisfies the cardy condition .    as a result",
    ", we found 18 superconformal defects ( see eq . ) .",
    "this set of superconformal defects includes purely transmissive ones and purely reflective ones as well as intermediate ones .",
    "we calculated transmission coefficient ( see eq . ) , introduced by @xcite , for these defects .",
    "the construction of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec - review ]",
    "we review general techniques treating defects : the folding trick , the cardy condition and so on .",
    "section [ sec - main ] is the main section of this paper where we find 18 superconformal defects in the tricritical ising model .",
    "we collect some properties of @xmath0 superconformal minimal models in appendix [ app - minimal ] . in appendix [ app - m=10 ]",
    "we classify all the boundary state in @xmath1 @xmath2 theory .",
    "in this section , we review some basic tools to treat the ( super)conformal defects in two dimensional cfts , like the folding trick and boundary states .      consider a defect line on the real axis between two conformal field theories ( @xmath6s ): @xmath7 defined on upper half plane and @xmath8 on the lower plane .",
    "the defect is called ` conformal ' if the current generating translation tangential to the defect is preserved across the defect . and it is called ` superconformal ' if supercurrents @xmath9 are preserved across the defect .",
    "these conditions are written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "there are two extremal cases of the gluing conditions .",
    "one is purely transmissive defects ; holomorphic and anti - holomorphic currents are continuous across the defects individually .",
    "this kind of defects is sometimes called `` topological defects '' in the literature . when two @xmath6s are the same , the simple example of purely transmissive defect is `` no defect . ''",
    "the other is totally reflecting defects ; each side of is zero . in this case , the two @xmath6s are decoupled and the defects can be considered as ( super)conformal boundaries of each @xmath6 .    in order to treat defects , it is convenient to use `` folding trick . '' by folding the two @xmath6s along the defects , we get the folded theory @xmath12 with boundary . @xmath13 means the cft obtained by exchanging holomorphic and anti - holomorphic degrees of freedom in @xmath6 .",
    "the defect becomes the boundary of this folded theory .",
    "actually the gluing conditions can be rewritten as @xmath14 these conditions are the ( super ) conformal boundary condition that the boundary states in @xmath15 should satisfy",
    ". therefore defects between two @xmath6s can be considered as boundary states in the folded theory .    in this paper",
    "we only treat left - right symmetric theory i.e. @xmath16 . so we just write @xmath17 instead writing @xmath18 .    here",
    "we make a remark about a subtlety for the `` direct product '' of two superconformal field theory . _",
    "the naive direct product of two superconformal field theories is not a superconformal field theory .",
    "_ this is because there is a sum of two susy currents with two different spin structures ( ns or r ) in the naive direct product theory .",
    "actually in order to satisfy eq . , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( and @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) must have the same spin structures ( see figure [ fig - spin ] ) .",
    "therefore when considering superconformal defect , we will employ the direct product theory with aligned spin structure , denoted by @xmath23 , as the auxiliary theory instead of the naive direct product theory .",
    "this is justified as follows .",
    "the defect operator @xmath24 is a map from the hilbert space of cft@xmath25 to that of cft@xmath26 .",
    "since @xmath24 preserve the supersymmetry , it must preserve the spin structure i.e. the periodicity of the susy current .",
    "namely it maps an nsns state to an nsns state and an rr state to an rr state ; it does not map an nsns state to an rr state or an rr state to an nsns state .",
    "thus , @xmath24 can be written as @xmath27 with some coefficients @xmath28 .",
    "after folding , @xmath24 becomes a state in the folded theory as @xmath29 this state @xmath30 can be embedded in @xmath23 , because the spin structure is aligned in @xmath30 .",
    "the gluing condition implies that @xmath30 should be written as a linear combination of the superconformal ishibashi states .",
    "moreover the consistency of the rectangular torus with two parallel defects implies the cardy condition .",
    "so we can work in @xmath23 as far as the cardy condition concerns .",
    "this prescription may not be perfect .",
    "as we will see , the complete classification of the superconformal boundary in @xmath23 is not a complete classification of the defects when both of cft@xmath25 and cft@xmath26 are the tricritical ising model .",
    "we will require that the `` no defect '' boundary state is included and find a set of the boundary states which satisfies the cardy condition .",
    "this set of the boundary states may not be a consistent set of the boundary states ; for example , they may not satisfy the consistency condition of the bulk - boundary ope in @xmath23 . the safest way to consider this ope condition should be to deal with operators in unfolded picture .    )",
    "must be the same in order to preserve the supersymmetry . ]",
    "if the folded theory @xmath31 ( or @xmath23 ) is a rational conformal field theory , we can effectively use the boundary state formalism and expect to get some classifications of the boundary states ( or defects in unfolded picture ) . in the next subsection",
    "we just give a quick review of the boundary states in a rational conformal field theory .",
    "consider a rational conformal field theory with chiral algebra @xmath32 ( in our case , superconformal symmetry ) , and the boundary condition which preserve @xmath32 out of @xmath33 .",
    "a simple way to preserve this chiral algebra is to impose the gluing conditions for the spin @xmath34 currents @xmath35 of @xmath32 at the boundary on real axis as @xmath36 the upper - half plane is mapped into infinitely long strip with width @xmath37 by the transformation @xmath38 . imposing the periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath39 direction , @xmath40 , the strip becomes finite cylinder of circumference @xmath41 and length @xmath37 .",
    "some boundary conditions @xmath42 and @xmath43 are imposed on the two boundaries , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the partition function @xmath46 in the cylinder can be calculated in two ways .",
    "firstly consider @xmath39 as time - direction .",
    "then the cylinder can be interpreted as worldsheet of open string propagating @xmath39-direction .",
    "the hamiltonian is given in terms of a virasoro generator in @xmath47-plane , @xmath48 .",
    "the open string hilbert space , denoted by @xmath49 , can be decomposed into the irreducible representations of the single chiral algebra @xmath32 since the boundary condition preserves @xmath32 . in other words there",
    "exist non - negative integers @xmath50 and @xmath49 is written as @xmath51 where @xmath52 are irreducible @xmath32-modules .",
    "the partition function can be written using the moduli parameter @xmath53 , @xmath54 as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the character of the representation @xmath57 defined as @xmath58    secondly if we consider @xmath59 direction as time , the cylinder can be considered as worldsheet of closed string propagating @xmath59-direction .",
    "the cylinder is mapped into an annulus in @xmath60-plane by the transformation @xmath61 . in this interpretation ,",
    "boundaries @xmath62 become initial and final states , @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively .",
    "these boundary states @xmath65 should satisfy the gluing conditions which becomes @xmath66 in @xmath60-plane . solutions to are spanned by special states called ishibashi states@xcite .",
    "let @xmath67 be the closed string hilbert space .",
    "then the ishibashi states in @xmath67 are @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a highest weight state and @xmath70 are orthonormal basis of @xmath57 . and the anti - unitary operator @xmath71 is defined by @xmath72 the closed string hamiltonian is given by @xmath73 in @xmath60-plane .",
    "the partition function can be written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 . if we express two boundary states @xmath77 as linear combinations of the ishibashi states , @xmath78 here we used the fact @xmath79 and the modular transformation rule for the character @xmath80",
    "@xmath81    for the consistency of the theory , @xmath46 calculated in two different ways must be identical .",
    "if we assume the characters are linearly independent , eq . and eq . imply @xmath82 this equation gives non - trivial condition on the coefficients @xmath83 since @xmath84 are non - negative integers ; this is called cardy condition .",
    "actually the characters are not linearly independent in the auxiliary theory in this paper .",
    "there are linear relations among @xmath5 superconformal characters @xmath85 thus eq . is not necessary for the equality of eq . and",

    "actually @xmath89 is also an @xmath0 minimal model .",

    "therefore the tensor product of two representations of ns ( or r ) algebra with @xmath93 @xmath94 can be decomposed into the representations of @xmath1 @xmath95 algebra .",
    "this decomposition can be explicitly seen from the character relations as follows .",
    "@xmath96 these relations are checked using the explicit form of the characters - by @xmath97 expansion .",

    "the result is written in appendix [ app - m=10 ] .",
    "we obtained two distinct complete sets of boundary states .",
    "however neither of these two sets can be interpreted as a complete set of the superconformal defects in the tricritical ising model .",
    "this is because they do not include `` no defect . ''",
    "another problem is that @xmath105 includes twice as many ramond states as unfolded theory as seen in eq .. when unfolding , a state in @xmath105 are mapped to an operator in the tricritical ising model .",
    "if the boundary states include both @xmath106 and @xmath107 ramond states , it is impossible to map those states to operators in the tricritical ising model while keeping the super virasoro action and inner product structure .    in the next subsection",
    ", we propose a set of boundary states which are free from these problems .      in this subsection , we consider the set of the boundary states which satisfies the following criteria .    1 .",
    "it includes `` no defect . ''",
    "it satisfies the cardy condition .",
    "we find a set of 18 boundary states which satisfies the above criteria .",
    "this is the main result of this paper .",
    "let us first explain `` no defect '' boundary state .",
    "boundary state @xmath108 in @xmath105 which corresponds to `` no defect '' in the tricritical ising model can be chosen as ( see appendix [ app - m=10 ] for notation used in this section ) @xmath109 presence of `` no defect '' has the same effects as absence of defects .",
    "therefore the annulus amplitude of two `` no defect '' boundary condition is equal to the toroidal partition function of the unfolded theory i.e. the tricritical ising model .",
    "actually it can be checked explicitly that @xmath110 is satisfied with @xmath111 of eq .. in section [ sec : transmission ] , we check that the transmission coefficient @xmath112 for @xmath108 equals to 1 . moreover @xmath108 can be expanded as ( see and ) @xmath113 before the folding . @xmath114",
    "note that `` no defect '' is not consistent ( in the sense of cardy condition ) with 36 boundary states in @xmath89 ( see appendix [ app - m=10 ] ) .",

    "it seems that this set of 18 boundary states is the maximal one which meets the criteria .    in this paper",
    ", we did not consider the consistency of the bulk - boundary ope .",
    "the 18 boundary states we obtained here may not be consistent in ope in the bulk theory @xmath105 , since there are other two sets of 36 boundary states which satisfy the cardy condition .",
    "however this is not a problem because what we want to do is to obtain the consistent set of defects in tricritical ising model , and it is different from the consistent boundary of @xmath105 .",
    "hence , ope consistency should be checked in the unfolded theory ( tricritical ising model ) instead of @xmath105 .",
