    "two of the main observational shortcomings of the standard model is that it lacks neutrino masses  @xcite as well as a viable candidate for cosmological dark matter  @xcite . even though light neutrinos themselves can account only for a very small fraction of the dark matter",
    ", they may hold the key to the basic understanding of what causes the dark matter to exist in the first place .",
    "indeed , the existence of neutrino masses and of cosmological dark matter may be closely interconnected in several ways  @xcite .",
    "for example , the mechanism of neutrino mass generation itself can involve the exchange of particles which make up the bulk of the observed dark matter .",
    "this is the main idea of scotogenic models  @xcite .",
    "the prototype model is based on the assumption that the dark sector , odd under a parity symmetry , is connected with the neutrino sector through the generation of the light neutrino masses . the dark matter particle plays the role of messenger of radiative neutrino mass generation  @xcite . in the simplest conventional scenario",
    "@xcite , the dark matter is made up of a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , for example , the lightest scalar component of an inert higgs doublet .    in this letter",
    "we explore the possibility of generating scotogenic dirac neutrino masses radiatively , by forbidding through the cyclic @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "this ensures strict and the diracness of neutrinos at higher orders .",
    "another discrete @xmath2 symmetry is responsible for dark matter stability .",
    "neutrino masses are generated only at the two  loop level , through the same sector responsible for cosmological dark matter .",
    "this new realization combines the idea of two  loop scotogenic neutrino masses suggested in  @xcite with the idea of having a conserved lepton number leading to the dirac nature of neutrinos . in our model",
    "there is a global u(1 ) symmetry which forbids the usual dirac mass term of the neutrinos with the standard higgs  @xcite  .",
    "this symmetry breaks spontaneously leading to a physical goldstone boson  a gauge singlet @xmath0  @xcite  which induces invisible higgs decays .",
    "these are analogous to the invisible higgs decays by majoron emission in models with majorana neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "the extra invisible channel adds up to the higgs boson decays to pairs of dark matter particles at collider experiments , providing tighter limits on wimp dark matter below @xmath1 .",
    "we will consider a simple extension of the standard model with the symmetries and field content indicated in table  [ tab : scotochido ] , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are cube roots of unity , i.e. @xmath5 . there are two complex @xmath6 doublets , @xmath7 and @xmath8 and three complex singlets , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",

    "the fermions @xmath23 and @xmath24 will form heavy dirac neutrinos by pairing with their corresponding partners @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the light neutrinos acquire their masses via the loop in fig .",
    "[ fig : loop ] . from the minimization of the scalar potential",
    ", the scalar fields charged under the @xmath22 do not acquire vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , while for the higgs and the @xmath9 fields , there are two relevant tadpole equations : @xmath27    the corresponding mass matrix for the cp - even `` active '' scalars is @xmath28    the pseudoscalars include the unphysical goldstone boson @xmath29 and a physical one , @xmath30 , namely the @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast to that of ref .  @xcite the @xmath0 here is a pure singlet under weak su(2 ) and hence is not subject to the strong astrophysical bound coming from stellar cooling considerations  @xcite .",
    "the mass matrices for the scalar and pseudoscalar `` dark '' sector ( charged under @xmath22 ) in the basis @xmath21 are given as @xmath31 and @xmath32 where the parameter @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 finally , the mass for the `` inert '' electrically charged scalar is given by @xmath35",
    "as usual in scotogenic models  @xcite  @xcite dark matter in our model can be either scalar or fermionic .",
    "here we focus on the first case , where the dark matter candidate is the lightest scalar eigenstate of @xmath36 in eqs .",
    "( [ inertr ] ) and ( [ inerti ] ) , which can be a general mixture of @xmath22charged doublet and singlet scalars @xmath37 and @xmath11 . an important requirement for the dark matter interpretation of such candidate is that its relic abundance matches the value observed by the planck collaboration .",
    "there are in principle three possibilities   none of the @xmath38 couplings can vanish exactly .",
    "hence the dark matter candidate is necessarily a combination of the triality  carrying scalars . ] :    * mainly doublet dark matter * generic doublet ",
    "singlet dark matter combination * mainly singlet dark matter    the first case can be arranged if the coupling @xmath39 is suppressed and/or the vev of @xmath9 is large . in this case one",
    "looses the signature corresponding to invisible higgs decay to the @xmath0 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : inv ] ) .",
    "the dark matter candidate is well studied in other similar scenarios such as the scotogenic model @xcite and the inert doublet model  @xcite . in this context , the sign of the dimensionless coupling @xmath40 , determines whether the dark matter has a either cp - odd or cp - even nature , and the correct relic abundance constrains the parameter @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ lam345 ] )  @xcite .    in the second and most general case",
    "the situation is analogous to that of sneutrino dark matter in the inverse seesaw model described in ref .",
    "the dark matter candidate is made up of a singlet - doublet combination with potentially `` comparable '' components , and can lead both to an adequate relic density as well as to a detectable signal in nuclear recoil .    finally ,",
    "the last and simplest of the three cases , corresponds to that in which the dark matter candidate is mainly singlet and is detected primarily by the higgs portal interaction . in the present model , the dark matter singlet would be given mainly by a combination of the fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "without loss of generality we will denote as @xmath42 the lightest combination of these singlets   and @xmath43 . ] .",
    "however , thanks to the @xmath22 nature of our dark matter candidate and to the presence of the @xmath0 , there are other distinctive features in our case .",
    "indeed , due to the cubic terms in the scalar potential , one finds that , besides annihilations , semi - annihilation processes play an important role in determining the dark matter relic density , as explained carefully in ref .",
    "in contrast to the case of @xmath44 dark matter , the dark matter spin  independent direct detection cross section is no longer directly related to the annihilation cross section .    in the case of interest ,",
    "the limit in which the dark matter candidate @xmath42 is stabilized by the @xmath22 symmetry has been studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "the dimensionful term @xmath45 contributes to the semi - annihilation processes like , for instance , @xmath46 that can dominate in the determination of the relic density . as a result the @xmath47 coupling no longer links the annihilation rate to the spin independent nuclear recoil detection cross section , in contrast to the more familiar case in which dark matter is stabilized by the @xmath44 symmetry  @xcite .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ]   .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ] +    over and above this observation , our model has further distinctively novel features associated to the presence of the @xmath0 .",
    "this leads to genuinely new interactions absent in previous dark matter models , including the simplest benchmark model studied in  @xcite as well as the possibilities analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite . indeed , concerning dark matter annihilation , there are new semi - annihilation channels involving the @xmath48 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fey ]  .",
    "these which should allow one to suppress the @xmath42 relic density with respect to the cases considered in these references . in addition , the @xmath0 plays a role in detection , see next .",
    "encouraged by the above arguments concerning dark matter annihilation and semi - annihilation processes and in view of the positive results of ref .",
    "@xcite , here we take for granted that an adequate relic abundance of the dark matter candidate particle can be ensured .",
    "we focus , instead , on another most salient feature of our model , namely , the presence of the invisible higgs boson decays into @xmath48 , i.e. @xmath49 and its impact upon the dark matter detection prospects .",
    "such decays through @xmath0 emission are the exact analogue of the invisible higgs decays by majoron emission in models with majorana neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "as long as the @xmath50 coupling is non  zero , this higgs decay mode also contributes in the range @xmath51 , that is , when the higgs decay into dark matter is kinematically allowed .",
    "the current bound on the invisible higgs decays is given by @xmath52  @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the invisible higgs decay width , @xmath53 , `` always '' has a contribution coming from its decay into @xmath48 , @xmath54 . as a result , for @xmath51 , where @xmath55 is the dark matter mass , the invisible decays have two sources , the @xmath56 and @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath58 . the standard model higgs is in general a combination of the doublet @xmath7 and the singlet @xmath9 , if we assume that the mixing between them is small , then @xmath59=@xmath60  mev , so that the bound on the invisible width is @xmath53<0.908169  mev . in this region",
    "there is a stronger constraint for the quartic coupling of the higgs with the dark matter , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:1sconts ] . in this figure",
    "we display the constraints on @xmath61 from the invisible decays of the higgs ( red region ) as well as from the lux  @xcite and pandax  @xcite direct detection spin ",
    "independent cross section ( purple and blue region , respectively ) .",
    ", @xmath61)-plane .",
    "the constraint from invisible higgs decays is indicated in red .",
    "the continuous purple line correspond to the recent limit reported by lux  @xcite from dark matter searches while the dot - dashed blue one indicates the current bound given by pandax  @xcite .",
    "the different shades in red for the invisible decays define different contributions of @xmath62 to @xmath63 ( see text).,width=302,height=226 ]    the different shades in red in fig .",
    "[ fig:1sconts ] correspond to different contributions of decays of higgs into @xmath48 , @xmath62 , the smaller the contribution of @xmath64 , the darker the region .",
    "for instance , the darkest red corresponds to the `` standard '' case with @xmath65 , while the lightest one is for @xmath66  mev . as a result",
    "the region excluded by the invisible higgs decays in the ( @xmath55,@xmath61)plane can be broader than the exclusion region set by the lux data for the mass range @xmath51 .",
    "in other words , the presence of the extra invisible decay channel into @xmath48 effectively increases the sensitivities to spin  independent wimp dark matter searches below @xmath1 .",
    "in this letter we have proposed a low  scale mechanism for naturally small dirac neutrino masses generated only at the two  loop level .",
    "the sector responsible for cosmological dark matter acts as messenger of neutrino mass generation .",
    "both dark matter stabilitity and strict lepton number conservation are `` symmetry protected '' .",
    "the presence of a global spontaneously broken u(1 ) symmetry leads to a physical goldstone boson , dubbed @xmath0 , that induces new invisible higgs decays detectable at lhc and other collider experiments .",
    "the coexistence of such decays with the higgs to dark matter channel , if kinematically allowed , leads to stronger sensitivities which we have quantified using current constraints from the lhc .",
    "detailed analysis of the primordial wimp dark matter density lies outside the scope of the present letter and will be presented elsewhere .",
