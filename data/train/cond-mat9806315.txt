    "<S> we report on dynamical simulations of bose - einstein condensation via evaporative cooling in an atomic trap . </S>",
    "<S> the results show evidence for spontaneous vortex formation and quantum dynamics in small traps .    </S>",
    "<S> evaporative cooling has been successfully used to produce bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) inside magneto - optic traps with neutral atoms@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a number of questions arise as to the quantum state that is achieved , since this involves both the dynamics of the cooling process and the applicability of the ergodic hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> atom - atom interactions have a strong influence on the cooling process and the final state in these experiments . </S>",
    "<S> quantum fluctuations are important in determining atom laser coherence properties@xcite , especially since the experimental systems do not have as large a particle number as traditional condensed matter experiments . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is no guarantee that a canonical ensemble will result from evaporative cooling , as the observations are made in a transient , non - equilibrium phase . </S>",
    "<S> thus , conventional canonical methods may not be applicable to these experiments .    in this paper , we report the use of phase - space methods for direct quantum dynamical calculations of the cooling and formation of bose - einstein condensates on a three - dimensional lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the results are restricted as yet to small condensates , due to the large numbers of modes involved . </S>",
    "<S> the computational results are very similar to those observed experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find quantum evaporative cooling , followed by a clear transition to a condensate . </S>",
    "<S> this is strongly influenced by non - classical features of the quantum dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations indicate additional structure , which we interpret as spontaneous formation of vortices - a process of much wider interest in other fields of physics @xcite . these appear to originate in the residual orbital angular momentum of the trapped atoms , which was neglected in previous studies , and </S>",
    "<S> would provide a significant test of the present theory .    </S>",
    "<S> earlier calculations of cooling dynamics have usually treated the cooling process either classically@xcite , or have used various additional assumptions about the quantum states involved . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the question of how to handle the transition to the final quantum dominated condensate , which is often assumed to be a canonical ensemble at a temperature estimated from the classical theory . </S>",
    "<S> the final ensemble behaviour is then usually calculated from the mean - field gross - pitaevskii equations@xcite , although some attempts have been made to go beyond this @xcite , including treatment of the kinetics of condensation@xcite based on a master equation </S>",
    "<S> . however , small atom traps are neither in the thermodynamic limit , nor necessarily in a steady - state . </S>",
    "<S> a first principles theory is really needed , to provide a benchmark for comparisons of these previous approximations , like the quantum monte carlo ( qmt ) theories@xcite in equilibrium systems .    </S>",
    "<S> in our calculations , we include @xmath0 relevant modes ( which is a very conservative estimate ) , with up to @xmath1 atoms present . the quantum state - vector therefore has over @xmath2 components . </S>",
    "<S> one possible approach in principle is to use quantum number state calculations in the time - domain . </S>",
    "<S> any direct calculation which includes all the relevant modes of the trapped atoms - up to the energy scales required for evaporating atoms to escape - is easily seen to be an enormous computational problem .    </S>",
    "<S> a more practical technique is to utilize phase - space methods that have already proved successful in laser theory . </S>",
    "<S> these techniques can handle large numbers of particles , but can also systematically treat departures from classical behaviour , including boson interactions . </S>",
    "<S> generalized phase - space representations were used to correctly predict quadrature squeezed quantum soliton dynamics in optical fibers@xcite , which are described by nearly identical quantum equations to those used in atom - atom interaction studies . </S>",
    "<S> the coherent - state ( positive-@xmath3 ) phase - space equations are exactly equivalent to the relevant quantum equations - provided phase - space boundary terms@xcite vanish . </S>",
    "<S> they have the advantage that they are computationally tractable for the large hilbert spaces typical of bec experiments . </S>",
    "<S> techniques of this sort can provide a first step towards extending qmt methods@xcite into the time - domain .    </S>",
    "<S> the model that we use includes the usual non - relativistic hamiltonian for neutral atoms in a trap @xmath4 , interacting via a potential @xmath5 , together with absorbing reservoirs @xmath6 , in @xmath7 or @xmath8 dimensions : @xmath9 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath10 represents a localized absorber that removes the neutral atoms - for example , via collisions with foreign atoms , or at the location of the ` rf - scalpel ' resonance , which is used to cause evaporative cooling@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we expand @xmath11 using free - field modes with a momentum cut - off @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> provided that @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the s - wave scattering length , @xmath15 can be replaced by the renormalized pseudo - potential @xmath16 , where @xmath17 in three dimensions . in two dimensions , @xmath18 </S>",
    "<S> is defined similarly but with a factor @xmath19 in the denominator , which corresponds to the effective spatial extent of the condensate in the third direction . </S>",
    "<S> this factor is of the order of the lattice spacing in the simulation , and is chosen to be equal to @xmath20 , the scaling length .    </S>",
    "<S> the resulting quantum time - evolution for the density matrix @xmath21 can be solved by expanding into a coherent - state basis , and then ( provided phase - space boundary terms vanish ) transforming to an equivalent set of equations in the positive-@xmath3 representation . the phase - space equations in the bec case </S>",
    "<S> can be expressed as two coupled complex partial stochastic differential equations of the form : @xmath22 \\psi_j \\ , ,   \\label{+p }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and where the stochastic fields @xmath24 are the coherent state amplitudes of a non - diagonal coherent state projector , @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> these equations can be readily simulated numerically@xcite in one , two or three transverse dimensions , with either attractive or repulsive potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the form of the potentials was chosen to be @xmath26^{2 } \\ , , \\label{v}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is typically the inverse of the total simulation time.the potential height was swept downwards linearly in time , thus successively removing cooler and cooler subpopulations of atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption rate @xmath28 was chosen as @xmath29^{50 } \\ , . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{gamma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath30 is the trap width in the j - th direction , such that @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the sinusoidal shape of the potential and absorption was chosen so that the trap would be harmonic near the center of the trap , and smoothly approach a maximum near the edge . </S>",
    "<S> thus hot atoms are absorbed when they reach regions of large @xmath28 , located near the trap edges .    </S>",
    "<S> a useful feature of eq ( [ + p ] ) is that in the deterministic limit , this corresponds precisely to the well - known gross - pitaevskii equations , with the addition of a coefficient @xmath28 for the absorption of atoms by the reservoirs . </S>",
    "<S> quantum effects come from the terms @xmath32 , which are real gaussian stochastic fields , with correlations : @xmath33 the quantum correlations that can be calculated include @xmath34 , which gives the observed momentum distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of the simulations depend critically on the exact parameters chosen , just as one would expect from the known sensitivity of the experiments to the precise experimental conditions . in practical computations , </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to consider rather small traps . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the numerical lattice spacing used to sample the stochastic fields in x - space must be of order @xmath35 , where @xmath12 is the largest ordinary momentum considered in the problem . </S>",
    "<S> however , the value of the corresponding kinetic energy , @xmath36 , must be large enough to allow energetic atoms to escape over the potential barrier of the trap , otherwise no cooling can take place . </S>",
    "<S> this sets an upper - bound on the lattice spacing , and hence on the maximum trap size - which depends on the number of lattice points that can be computed .    </S>",
    "<S> the available lattice sizes used here were @xmath37 points , depending on the dimensionality @xmath38 . with this limit , and parameter values similar to those used in the experiments , the available trap sizes that can be treated are of the order of micron dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> these are smaller than those used currently , although traps of this type are quite feasible . </S>",
    "<S> the other possibility within the constraints is to use a trap which is of larger dimensions but lower in potential height . for this type of trap </S>",
    "<S> which was simulated here , the width was @xmath39 , with a potential height of @xmath40 , and an initial temperature of @xmath41 .    for physical reasons , </S>",
    "<S> a further limitation is that the initial density must be such that @xmath42 - otherwise the starting point would already have a bose - einstein condensation . </S>",
    "<S> this places a limit on the number of atoms which can simulated , if we assume an initially non - condensed grand canonical ensemble of ( approximately ) non - interacting atoms . </S>",
    "<S> there were initially around @xmath43 atoms in the two dimensional simulations reported here , and @xmath44 in the three dimensional case . </S>",
    "<S> these corresponded to atomic densities of @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively .    for the small trap parameters used in the simulations , the effect of the stochastic terms on the dynamics </S>",
    "<S> is very large . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the quantum fluctuations that these stochastic terms introduce are much larger than the initial thermal fluctuations , such that the initial features of the distribution do not persist . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the choice of the initial state of the system is not critical , and also that in order to determine properties of the final quantum ground state of the system , the stochastic terms are vital . for comparison , we investigated the effect of removing the quantum noise terms , so that the simulations were simply of the gross - pitaevskii equation , with initial conditions corresponding to a thermal state . for our parameters , these situations did not show strong bose condensation effects , in contrast to the fully quantum - mechanical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates the highly non - classical nature of the early stages of bose - condensation , in which spontaneous transitions to the lowest energy states clearly play an important role .    for the simulations shown in the figures , @xmath47 and </S>",
    "<S> the mass , corresponding to rubidium , is @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> these parameters correspond to relatively weakly interacting atoms , in order to reduce the sampling error - which increased rapidly with longer times and larger coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> no large phase - space excursions were observed with these parameters . </S>",
    "<S> all results are plotted in normalized units , with space scaled by @xmath49 , and time scaled by @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the time - step was typically @xmath51 , with all calculations being repeated at half the time - step ( and noise sampled from the same process with twice the resolution@xcite ) , to check numerical convergence . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary absorption term was set to @xmath52 .    in momentum space , </S>",
    "<S> the final atom density for individual trajectories in both two and three dimensions is quite narrow and tall , with a width corresponding to a temperature well below the critical temperature for bec . </S>",
    "<S> the peak final momentum state population is much greater than one ( and greater than the initial conditions ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is more pronounced in the three dimensional case than in two dimensions , showing that the evaporative cooling process is more efficient with the extra degree of freedom and the greater number of atoms that are present .    as is usual in quantum mechanics , only the ensemble averages of the simulations have an operational meaning . thus , while individual stochastic realizations have a definite coherent phase , these phases are different for distinct stochastic realizations  the ensemble average has no absolute phase information . </S>",
    "<S> the average evolution of a two dimensional condensate is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) ; in this case , the condensate is only weakly occupied :    since the condensate does not have to form in the ground - state , the bose - condensed peaks that occur at different momentum values in single runs are averaged out in the overall ensemble . a more useful indication of condensation is given by the following measure of phase - space confinement : @xmath53 this higher order correlation function is the quantum analogue of the participation ratio defined by hall@xcite . figure </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) shows the evolution of @xmath54 calculated from 15 runs of the three dimensional simulation . the sharp rise near @xmath55 is a strong indication of condensation occurring at this point .    for the finite - size condensates in atom traps , just as the final ground state is not expected to be precisely the zero momentum eigenstate , so too such condensates </S>",
    "<S> are not constrained to fall into the @xmath56 angular momentum eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> both the initial and the escaping atoms have an arbitrary angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> we can estimate that the variance in angular momentum will scale approximately as @xmath57 , from central limit theorem arguments . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can expect that each trapped condensate should have angular momentum , unless constrained by the trap geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the angular momentum can be carried either by quasi - particles or vortices , although a volume - filling @xmath58-th order vortex has @xmath59 , and therefore can not form spontaneously in the thermodynamic limit of large n. for small condensates , a @xmath60 vortex may be quite likely . </S>",
    "<S> several authors@xcite have considered how such vortex states may form through stirring or rotating a condensate , and the stability of vortices has been explored@xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we consider the possibility of vortices forming spontaneously in the condensate through the process of evaporative cooling , without external intervention .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of vortex states can be detected quantitatively by transforming the spatial lattice into a lattice which uses the angular momentum eigenstates as a basis set . </S>",
    "<S> the two - dimensional results , which are presented here , are obtained by integrating the spatial profile over orthogonal modes with corresponding field operators @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> the angular momentum distribution is then given by a summation over the radial modes : @xmath62    the angular momentum distribution for individual trajectories shows large occupation in particular angular modes , different for each run . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that vortices with different momenta appear each time . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in one run , a vortex with @xmath63 appears at about one quarter of the way through the simulation , and persists until the end . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum occupation of the vortex is around @xmath64 , owing to relatively small initial atom numbers in this 2d trap simulation . shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) is the ensemble average of the angular momentum distribution , which reveals quite a broad range of final angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the existence of vortices .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated a three - dimensional real - time quantum dynamical simulation of bose - condensation with mesoscopic numbers of interacting atoms on a large lattice . </S>",
    "<S> sampling errors and lattice size restrictions impose strong limitations on these initial simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the results , as well as showing evidence for highly non - classical behaviour in a first principles simulation of bec formation , indicate the possibility of spontaneous vortex formation in small evaporatively cooled condensates . </S>"
