    "methanol masers are commonly found in massive star - forming regions .",
    "they fall into 2 categories first defined by @xcite and further considered by @xcite : class  ii masers ( of which the 6.7 ghz is the best known and usually strongest ) are closely associated with infrared sources and reside in the close environment of exciting ( proto-)stars . in contrast , class  i masers ( e.g. 95 ghz ) are usually found offset ( by up to a parsec ) from continuum sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "theoretical calculations strongly suggest that class  i masers are pumped via collisions with the molecular hydrogen in contrast to class ii masers , which have a radiative pump ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "class i masers are relatively poorly studied .",
    "there is direct observational evidence to suggest a relationship between these masers and outflows in a number of sources @xcite , although another scenario , which involves cloud - cloud collisions , has also been proposed @xcite .",
    "the common point of these two scenarios is the presence of shocks .",
    "there is observational evidence that methanol abundance is significantly increased in the shock processed regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the gas is expected to be heated and compressed in such regions providing more frequent collisions and , therefore , more efficient pumping .    [ cols=\">,^,>,>,^,^,^,>,>,^ \" , ]     theoretical studies of class  i methanol masers were impeded for a long time by the absence of an adequate model of collisions for the methanol molecule .",
    "recently calculated rate coefficients ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have encouraged pumping studies of these masers . @xcite performed a qualitative analysis and revealed that the 25-ghz masers are bright in models with specific column density ( equivalent to the column density divided by the line - width ) greater than 10@xmath6  @xmath7  s and require relatively high kinetic temperatures ( 75@xmath8100  k ) and densities ( 10@xmath9  @xmath7 ) .",
    "similar conditions are required for the 9.9- and 104-ghz masers , although they prefer a greater beaming ( elongated geometry ) and either lower densities or higher temperatures ( more than 100  k ) .",
    "spot b is an excellent test site to develop a class  i pumping model because of the large number of transitions detected .",
    "however , a detailed investigation of the vast parameter space of the maser models is beyond the scope of this paper and will be reported elsewhere . at present",
    "we are unable to reproduce the relative brightnesses of all transitions detected in spot b in a single model similar to that of @xcite .",
    "we suspect that gradients in the physical parameters may be influential and leading to the co - existence of the different pumping regimes on spatial scales unresolved by atca .",
    "it is expected that strong gradients may accompany shocks , although their effects on the maser pumping are yet to be studied . according to table  [ fit_results ] the peak components at 25 and 95  ghz",
    "are displaced by not more than 01 .",
    "most likely this displacement is caused by a systematic error due to the structure of the 95-ghz maser because no such displacement is observed for the 84-ghz maser . taking this uncertainty as an upper limit and assuming a distance to the source of 2.9  kpc ,",
    "the parameters must change on a scale around 300 au or less .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that firm conclusions about any gradients can only be made after an extensive parameter search . in this paper",
    "we have just illustrated the situation using two representative models selected from the range of models calculated by @xcite .",
    "outlines of the modelling procedure applicable to class  i masers can be found in @xcite and the code is described by @xcite and references therein .",
    "both models use a kinetic temperature ( t@xmath10 ) of 75  k , an intrinsic linewidth ( to simulate blending of spectral lines ) of 0.5  km  s@xmath1 , and a methanol abundance relative to hydrogen of @xmath11 .",
    "the parameters that differ between these two models are the hydrogen number density ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 and @xmath14  @xmath7 , the specific column density ( equivalent to the column density divided by the line - width ) , @xmath15 and @xmath16  @xmath7  s , and the beaming factor  ( @xmath17 ) , 20 and 30 , for the first and the second models respectively . the results of the simulations are shown in table  [ model_res ] .",
    "most of the columns are self explanatory , the columns labelled @xmath18 give a decimal logarithm of the ratio of the integrated flux density of the transition to that of the j=4 25-ghz transition ( as observed and for each of the models ) .",
    "the uncertainties of the observed @xmath19 are given in the parentheses and expressed in units of the least significant figure .",
    "these are cumulative uncertainties , which , in general , account for both the absolute flux density scale uncertainty and that of the integrated flux density given in table  [ fit_results ] .",
    "the j=2 and 3 transitions were observed simultaneously with the reference ( j=4 ) transition in the same band ( see section  [ obs_section ] ) .",
    "therefore , the ratio @xmath20 is not affected by the absolute flux density scale calibration for these two transitions .",
    "other columns contain the brightness temperatures ( @xmath21 ) and optical depths ( @xmath22 ) predicted by the two models .",
    "figure  [ rotd ] illustrates the dependence of @xmath18 on the excitation energy for the 25-ghz series ( data from table  [ model_res ] ) .",
    "open squares and triangles correspond to the first and the second models , respectively .",
    "observed values are shown by the filled circles with error bars corresponding to the 3@xmath23 uncertainty .",
    "the observed dependence represents essentially a rotational diagram ( because the product of the spontaneous decay rate by the statistical weight does not vary much throughout the series ) , which is a well known method to analyze the level populations of the molecule ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the plot of observed values shows a significant curvature , although a linear fit to the highest j transitions is possible .",
    "such a fit , which takes into account all transitions with j@xmath24 , has a rotational temperature of 80@xmath2510  k. it should be remembered that this temperature is unlikely to be related to any physical or even excitation temperature .",
    "the latter is estimated correctly if the fitted 25-ghz transitions are all optically thin or have the same optical depth .    ) versus the exitation energy for the 25-ghz masers detected in spot b. open squares and triangles correspond to the first and the second models ( see table  [ model_res ] ) , respectively .",
    "observed values are represented by the filled circles .",
    "the j=4 transition is taken as a reference ( see text ) .",
    "therefore , the observed point and the model points coincide exactly for this transition .",
    "the error bars for observed values represent a cumulative 3@xmath23 uncertainty , which takes into account the uncertainty of the absolute flux density scale for j@xmath264 transitions ( j=2,3 and 4 transitions were observed simultaneously in the same band ; see section  [ obs_section ] ) .",
    "there are two independent observations of the j=6 transition . ]",
    "it is evident from table  [ model_res ] that despite the fact that the first model describes the ratios for the 9.9 and the 25-ghz transitions quite well , it fails to produce the masers at 84 , 95 and 104  ghz .",
    "similarly , the second model is adequate for 9.9- , 84- , 95- and 104-ghz masers , but fails to describe the behavior of the high j 25-ghz transitions ( fig .",
    "[ rotd ] ) .",
    "the brightness temperature of the reference @xmath27  e transition is 1.9@xmath28 and @xmath29  k , for the first and the second models respectively ( see table  [ model_res ] ) .",
    "both these values are in agreement with the observed lower limit ( @xmath30  k , table  [ fit_results ] ) .",
    "h@xmath4o , oh and both classes of methanol masers often , but not always , are present in the same region of high - mass star formation .",
    "the question whether these masers trace an evolutionary sequence ( with a partial overlap in time ) has been investigated in various studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . from their analysis of a large sample of star - forming regions @xcite concluded that the compact , isolated h@xmath4o masers mark the earliest evolutionary stages , and oh masers appear afterwards .",
    "the class  ii methanol masers at 6.7  ghz seem to largely overlap with the h@xmath4o masers and precede oh ( e.g. , szymczak et al .",
    "the majority of class  ii masers are not associated with detectable hii regions @xcite , but show an association with millimetre and submillimetre @xcite sources which leaves no doubt that they trace a very early stage of the ( proto)stellar evolution .",
    "however , the question as to where the class  i methanol masers fit into this picture is still poorly understood .",
    "the main obstacle is the lack of untargeted surveys of class  i masers , which have not been undertaken mainly because there is no widespread , bright , low frequency maser transition similar to the 6.7  ghz class  ii transition , or mainline oh . most class  i masers , except for a few famous sources like omc-1 , have been found towards known class  ii methanol or oh maser sites , which are often located within a single dish beam ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , all these samples are biased .",
    "@xcite investigated this question using the infrared properties of a subsample of methanol masers associated with glimpse ( galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire ) catalogue point sources . despite the small number statistics , which makes any firm conclusions impossible , it was found that the sources with a class  i maser seem to have redder glimpse colours than those without it .",
    "based on these results , @xcite concluded that the class  i methanol masers may signpost an earlier stage of high - mass star formation than the class  ii masers .",
    "@xcite detected both mainline oh and h@xmath4o masers in iras 16547 - 4247 at a position close to the central continuum source in fig .",
    "[ genmorph ] . taking into account the information given in the previous paragraph",
    ", one may expect the source to be relatively old and most likely to be active in class  ii maser transitions .",
    "it is generally assumed that each high - mass star - forming region has a detectable 6.7  ghz maser sometime during the early stages of its evolution regardless of the maser variability and the source geometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , no 6.7-ghz emission has been detected in this source ( upper limit of 0.3  jy , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in contrast to the detection of the large number of class  i masers reported in this paper .",
    "this fact encourages us to revisit the question of where class  i methanol masers fit into an evolutionary sequence .    , but with the glimpse 5.8-@xmath5 m emission shown by greyscale . ]",
    "the glimpse survey @xcite provides mid - infrared images of the galactic plane with unprecedented sensitivity .",
    "figure  [ glimpse_mas ] shows the locations of the radio continuum , methanol , oh and water masers superimposed on the glimpse 5.8-@xmath5 m emission ( greyscale ) on the same scale as fig .",
    "[ genmorph ] .",
    "the most striking feature of this image is that there are no mir sources associated with either the jet source , nor the class  i masers .",
    "diffuse emission , probably arising from the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) band at 6.2  @xmath5 m appears to be associated with the outflow region and traces a similar area to the shock - excited h@xmath4 .",
    "although , unlike the h@xmath4 , the pah emission is stronger closer to the central continuum source and very faint in the vicinity of spot  b. the glimpse 3.6-@xmath5 m image shows similar diffuse emission , also likely to be associated with pah emission , in this case from the 3.3-@xmath5 m band .",
    "[ glimpse_mas ] also shows a strong , extended mir source lying between spots d and f. we have also examined the _ msx _ images of this region which show that although the 12-@xmath5 m emission ( c - band ) is centred on the strong mir source seen in fig .",
    "[ glimpse_mas ] , the 21-@xmath5 m emission ( e - band ) is offset and centred on the central continuum source .",
    "that the source driving the jet / outflow / masers is only visible at wavelengths longer than 12  @xmath5 m suggests that this source is at a very early evolutionary phase .",
    "@xcite argued that the observed cm - wavelength continuum emission towards iras  16547 - 4247 is too weak for such a luminous object ( @xmath31 l@xmath32 ) .",
    "supported by the characteristics of the spectral line profiles , @xcite explained this flux discrepancy by the ongoing intense accretion , which forbids the development of an ultra - compact hii region .",
    "intense accretion is further evidence for an early evolutionary phase .",
    "@xcite found the vast majority of class  ii methanol maser sources to be associated with mir emission visible in the glimpse 8.0-@xmath5 m observations . that such emission is absent in this source",
    "argues that it is likely to be at an earlier evolutionary phase than that which produces class  ii methanol masers ; however , this is in direct contrast with the presence of oh masers which would generally be taken to support the opposite interpretation .    in theory , a moderately dense gas ( dense enough to switch the collisional pumping on , but not dense enough to produce thermalization ) , rich in methanol and separated from strong infrared sources is able to produce most class  i methanol masers @xcite .",
    "the fact that the class  i masers do not require infrared radiation for pumping suggests that they might exist at earlier evolutionary stages than the class  ii masers , which need a nearby infrared source for pumping .",
    "however , a mechanism able to increase the methanol abundance above that seen in cold cores must already be active or have been active in the past to produce a detectable maser . as was discussed above ,",
    "a release of methanol from the grain mantles by weak shocks is a good example of such a mechanism .",
    "one can not exclude the possibility that class i masers survive even when the shock , which had increased the methanol abundance in the past , has already dissipated .",
    "rare class  i masers at 9.9 and 104  ghz require more energetic conditions @xcite .",
    "they are most likely ( or even exclusively ) located near the young shocks .",
    "spot b in fig .",
    "[ genmorph ] is likely to be a good example of such a situation . if the idea that the common class  i masers can outlast the shock is correct , these masers become hard to destroy , once they appear .",
    "situated at a considerable distance from the central object they probably fade out slowly as the methanol abundance decreases ( e.g. due to freezeout or gas - phase chemical processing , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , unless the chemical composition of the medium is altered once again by new energetic outflow events or by a slight change in the outflow direction .",
    "a new epoch of interaction between the outflow and the medium can either destroy the molecules engaged in the maser emission or produce new masers .",
    "assuming typical outflow velocities of 10@xmath33  km  s@xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it would take at least 10@xmath34 - 10@xmath35 years for this disturbance to reach the maser sites for the given distance to the source ( 2.9  kpc ) and the angular separations of masers from the central object ( see table  [ fit_results ] ) .",
    "a timescale for methanol destruction by ion - molecule reactions has approximately the same order of magnitude ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the class  ii masers are usually located very close to the yso and , therefore , can be more easily destroyed during the course of its evolution . given the detection of oh masers , which suggests an evolved stage , it is , therefore , possible that the 6.7-ghz maser has already been quenched in the studied source .",
    "we can not presently resolve the contradiction between the infrared data and the presence of oh masers and confidently determine whether the source is too young or too old to have a 6.7-ghz maser .",
    "however , these speculations show that the evolutionary stage where the class  i masers are active , may in fact last longer and start earlier than when the class  ii masers are active .",
    "the class  i methanol maser emission consists of a cluster of 6 spots spread over an area of 30 in extent .",
    "five spots were detected in only the 84- and 95-ghz transitions ( for two spots the 84-ghz detection is marginal ) , while the sixth spot shows activity in all 12 observed transitions .",
    "the three most southern maser spots show clear association with a jet - driven molecular outflow .",
    "their velocities are close to that of the molecular core within which the jet is embedded .",
    "this fact supports the idea that the class  i masers reside in the interface regions of outflows .",
    "comparison with oh masers and infrared data reveals a potential discrepancy in the expected evolutionary state : the presence of the oh masers usually means that the source is evolved , but the infrared data suggest otherwise .",
    "the class  ii methanol masers at 6.7  ghz are very widespread and are usually treated as an inevitable phenomenon at some stage of high - mass protostellar evolution ( see section  [ evolution_section ] ) .",
    "the lack of such a maser in this source ( which is active in many class  i maser transitions ) raises an additional question concerning its evolutionary state : whether this source is too young or too old to have a 6.7  ghz maser ?",
    "we argue that both cases are possible because the class  i masers do not require an infrared source for pumping and are harder to destroy than the class  ii masers , which are usually located close to the yso .",
    "we , therefore , suggest that the evolutionary stage where the class  i masers are present may last longer than that with the class  ii masers , although the exact status of this source is not clear at present .",
    "we report the first interferometric observations of the rare 9.9- and 104-ghz masers .",
    "the spectra for these transitions contain a very narrow spike ( @xmath0  km  s@xmath1 ) which has a brightness temperature greater than @xmath2 and @xmath3  k at 9.9 and 104  ghz , respectively .",
    "5 .   high spectral resolution data",
