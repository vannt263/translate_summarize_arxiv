    "highly polarized helium-3 is used in various fields of science , for example , to perform magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of air spaces in human lungs @xcite , or to prepare spin filters for neutrons @xcite and polarized targets for nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "the most successful methods presently used to polarize helium-3 are spin - exchange optical pumping using alkali atoms @xcite , and pure - helium metastability exchange optical pumping @xcite .",
    "the applications have driven research towards improvement in terms of photon efficiency , steady - state polarization , and production rate , both for spin exchange optical pumping @xcite , and metastability exchange optical pumping @xcite .",
    "the metastability exchange technique was demonstrated by colegrove , schearer , and walters over forty years ago @xcite . in standard conditions ,",
    "metastability exchange optical pumping is performed at low pressure ( 1  mbar ) in a guiding magnetic field up to a few mt .",
    "metastable @xmath0s - state atoms are produced using a radiofrequency discharge .",
    "they are optically pumped using the @xmath0s-@xmath1p transition at 1083  nm .",
    "the electronic polarization is transferred to the nuclei by hyperfine interaction . through metastability exchange collisions ,",
    "nuclear polarization is transferred to ground state helium-3 atoms .",
    "metastability exchange optical pumping in standard conditions provides in a few seconds high nuclear polarizations ( up to 90% at 0.7  mbar @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the achieved nuclear polarization rapidly drops down when the helium-3 pressure exceeds a few mbar @xcite .",
    "therefore , a delicate polarization - preserving compression stage is necessary for all applications needing a dense sample .",
    "we recently demonstrated that operating at 1.5  t can significantly improve the nuclear polarization achieved at high pressures @xcite , using one of the most intense lines in the @xmath0s-@xmath0p absorption spectrum . here ,",
    "we show that a different choice of optical pumping transition can further improve the steady - state polarization although the production rate is slightly lower .",
    "we also describe more precisely the experimental protocol , and demonstrate the consistency of the optical absorption technique for dynamic measurement of the nuclear polarization in presence of the optical pumping laser .",
    "experiments are performed in the bore of a clinical mri scanner providing a homogeneous 1.5  t magnetic field .",
    "the experimental apparatus is shown in fig.[fig : setup ] .",
    "the helium-3 gas is enclosed in a sealed cylindrical pyrex cell , @xmath2 cm in diameter and @xmath2 cm in length .",
    "cells filled with pressure @xmath3=1.33 , 8 , 32 , and 67  mbar of pure helium-3 are used .",
    "a radiofrequency high voltage applied to electrodes on the outside of the cell generates a weak electrical discharge in the gas .",
    "it is used to populate the @xmath0s state and maintain a metastable atoms density n@xmath4 in the range 1 - 8@xmath510@xmath6 atoms/@xmath7 , depending on the applied voltage and the gas pressure .",
    "the optical pumping laser is a 50  mw single mode laser diode amplified by a 0.5  w ytterbium - doped fiber amplifier @xcite .",
    "the laser wavelength can be tuned by temperature control over the entire spectrum of the @xmath0s-@xmath0p transition of helium ( @xmath8150  ghz at 1.5  t , see fig.[fig : spectre ] ) .",
    "the circular polarization of the pump beam is obtained using a combination of polarizing cube and quarter - wave retarding plate .",
    "the pump beam is back - reflected after a first pass in the cell to enhance its absorption , and collected by a photodiode to measure its absorption .",
    "the probe beam is provided by another single mode laser diode .",
    "it is attenuated and linearly polarized perpendicularly to the magnetic field .",
    "the absorption of probe and pump lasers are measured using a modulation technique .",
    "the discharge intensity is modulated at @xmath9  hz and the absorptions are measured with lock - in amplifiers .",
    "the average values of the transmitted probe and pump intensities are also recorded .",
    "laser sources and electronics remain several meters away from the magnet bore in a low - field region .      the structure of the @xmath0s-@xmath0p transition and zeeman sublevels of helium-3 at 1.5  t is described in @xcite .    in our experiments",
    ", optical pumping is performed using one of the two @xmath10 pumping lines labeled f@xmath11 or f@xmath12 in the absorption spectrum displayed in fig.[fig : spectre ] .",
    "the f@xmath11 line consists of four unresolved transitions spreading over 1.31  ghz .",
    "given the doppler width of @xmath13helium-3 at room temperature ( 2  ghz  fwhm ) , it addresses simultaneously four metastable sublevels a@xmath14 to a@xmath11 with @xmath15=-3/2 , -1/2 and 1/2 , where @xmath15 is the magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum ( see fig.[fig : opscheme ] ) . the f@xmath12 line ( two transitions split by 1.37  ghz ) simultaneously addresses sublevels a@xmath16 and a@xmath17 with @xmath18=1/2 and 3/2 .",
    "the population transfer into a@xmath16 and a@xmath17 for f@xmath11 pumping ( or into a@xmath14 to a@xmath11 for f@xmath12 pumping ) occurs as follows : excitation by laser absorption , collisional redistribution in the @xmath0p state , and spontaneous emission .",
    "the optical detection method used in our experiments is based on absorption measurements using a weak probe beam .",
    "this absorption technique does not need any calibration and can be used at arbitrary magnetic field , and pressure @xcite .",
    "it relies on the fact that in the absence of optical pumping , metastability exchange collisions impose a spin temperature distribution for the metastable populations @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the spin temperature in the @xmath0s state related to the nuclear polarization @xmath21 in the ground state @xmath22 .    in practice ,",
    "the probe laser frequency is swept over two lines .",
    "peaks amplitudes are precisely measured by a fit to a voigt absorption profile .",
    "the population ratio of the two hyperfine sublevels addressed by the probe lines is then found using the field - dependent computed transition probabilities , and is used to calculate the spin temperature .",
    "hence , the ground - state nuclear polarization @xmath21 is inferred @xcite .",
    "polarization build - up is monitored in the presence of the optical pumping beam .",
    "therefore , the probe absorption measurements must involve metastable sublevels not addressed by the optical pumping laser . in our configuration ( see fig.[fig : opscheme ] ) , the populations of sublevels a@xmath16 and a@xmath17 ( respectively a@xmath14 and a@xmath12 ) are measured for f@xmath11 ( respectively f@xmath12 ) pumping .",
    "fig.[fig : spintemp]a shows typical absorption spectra recorded in the absence and in the presence of the pump laser . in the absence of the pump laser ( solid line ) , the spectrum is accurately fit by the spectrum computed assuming a spin temperature distribution ( residue plot in fig.[fig : spintemp]b ) .",
    "the presence of the pump strongly affects the population distribution , with efficient population transfer from the pumped levels to a@xmath16 and a@xmath17 and modifies the absorption profile ( dashed line ) .",
    "however the ratio of populations in sublevels a@xmath16 and a@xmath17 remains unaffected , and an absorption measurement still accurately provides the correct value for @xmath23    an example of dynamical measurement of polarization build - up and decay is shown in fig.[fig : example ] for the 8  mbar cell .",
    "several scans of the probe laser are recorded successively , and the value of the nuclear polarization @xmath21 is inferred as a function of time . the gas is initially polarized to the equilibrium positive value of @xmath21 achieved with f@xmath11 pumping . at time @xmath24 , the pump laser is tuned to the f@xmath12 line . when the new steady - state polarization @xmath25 is reached , the pump laser is turned off and polarization decays by discharge - induced relaxation .",
    "several experimental parameters influence the performances of optical pumping : the cell geometry , the gas pressure , the discharge conditions ( voltage , electrodes configuration ) which impact on @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the optical pumping transition , and the pump laser power .",
    "a systematic study of optical pumping using the f@xmath11 line has been reported in @xcite . here",
    ", we focus on the comparison of optical pumping with f@xmath11 and f@xmath12 lines in the same cells .",
    "we present selected results obtained with identical discharge conditions for f@xmath11 and f@xmath12 , using a 0.5  w pump power .    the f@xmath12 line yields higher steady - state polarizations but f@xmath11 allows pumping with significantly shorter build - up times ( fig.[fig : bestmtb ] ) . as a result , the magnetization production rates @xmath28 are slightly lower for f@xmath12 ( see table  [ table : ra ] ) .",
    "the main difference between the two optical pumping lines actually lies in the photon efficiency , defined as the number of polarized nuclei per photon absorbed by the gas .",
    "a simple calculation , based on the average angular momentum transfer from polarized light to atoms during one absorption - collisional redistribution - spontaneous emission cycle , shows that the photon efficiency of f@xmath12 should be approximately twice that of f@xmath11 .",
    "this has been experimentally checked , at various laser powers .",
    "magnetization production rates for f@xmath12 pumping are yet slightly lower due to the lower absorption of the pump beam on this line with respect to f@xmath11 .",
    "[ c]c|c|c| & + & f@xmath11 & f@xmath12 + & 0.07 & 0.05 + & 0.13 & 0.12 + & 0.17 & 0.11 +    [ table : ra ]",
    "we have compared the performances of two different optical pumping lines at 1.5  t in helium-3 gas , at high pressures ( up to 67  mbar ) .",
    "the strongest line of the @xmath10 absorption spectrum ( f@xmath11 ) yields the highest magnetization production rates .",
    "however , the highest steady - state nuclear polarizations ( up to @xmath29 at @xmath30  mbar ) are achieved using a weaker line with higher photon efficiency .",
    "f@xmath12 pumping , requiring fewer absorbed photons to achieve the same production rate , is thus advantageous when long , optically thick pumping cells are used .",
    "given the structure of sublevels and optical transitions , one could expect that the two most intense @xmath31 lines would be just as efficient as the corresponding @xmath10 lines .",
    "similar optical pumping performances have indeed been obtained , although no systematic comparison has been carried out .",
    "an analysis of all optical pumping data collected at 1.5  t is under way using a detailed model of metastability exchange optical pumping in high field conditions , and will be the subject of a forthcoming paper ."
