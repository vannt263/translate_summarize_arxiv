    "in 1965 , segre @xcite introduced the notion of a _ hemisystem _ , that is a set of lines which contains exactly half the lines on each point , in his work on _ regular systems _ of the hermitian surface .",
    "segre proved that there is just one hemisystem of lines ( up to equivalence ) of the classical generalised quadrangle @xmath0 , and thirty years later , it was conjectured by j. a. thas @xcite that there are no hemisystems of @xmath1 for @xmath2 . however , forty years after segre s seminal paper , cossidente and penttila @xcite constructed , for each odd prime power @xmath3 , a hemisystem of @xmath1 . since this work",
    ", hemisystems have received renewed attention in finite geometry ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the concept of a hemisystem was extended by cameron , delsarte and goethals @xcite to all generalised quadrangles with the same parameters @xmath4 as the hermitian surface , and in addition , they showed that such an object gives rise to a _ partial quadrangle _ , and hence also , to a strongly regular graph .",
    "the only known generalised quadrangles of order @xmath4 , @xmath5 odd , are the _ flock generalised quadrangles _ , and we know that for @xmath5 prime , these are the only elation generalised quadrangles with these parameters ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there are nine known infinite families of such generalised quadrangles , and at least forty other examples for @xmath6 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "as far as the authors are aware , the known hemisystems of these generalised quadrangles are listed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in particular ,",
    "only one hemisystem of a nonclassical flock generalised quadrangle has previously been constructed ( in @xcite ) .",
    "it is the main purpose of this work to establish the following :    [ thm : intro ] every flock generalised quadrangle of order @xmath4 , @xmath5 odd , contains a hemisystem .",
    "if @xmath7 is a hemisystem of a generalised quadrangle of order @xmath4 , then we can build a partial quadrangle by taking the point - set to be @xmath7 , and the line - set to be the points of the generalised quadrangle .",
    "the point - graph of a partial quadrangle is strongly regular and the small number of constructions of such graphs are outlined later in this section .",
    "the complement of a hemisystem is again a hemisystem , however , the two strongly regular graphs arising may not necessarily be isomorphic ( see @xcite for an example of such an instance ) .",
    "a hemisystem also gives rise to a cometric @xmath8-class association scheme that is not metric , which are indeed rare in the literature ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we will explain precisely what the flock generalised quadrangles are in section [ section : background ] , but we stress here that we rely heavily on the geometric model of knarr @xcite .",
    "this yields flock generalised quadrangles from substructures known as _ blt - sets _ of the symplectic polar space @xmath9 , but we can identify them with a set of planes incident with a point of @xmath9 . ] . the linear blt - set yields the classical flock generalised quadrangle @xmath1 via this construction , and varying the blt - set gives all flock generalised quadrangles .",
    "we interpret the cossidente - penttila hemisystems of @xmath1 in this model , and show that analogously , varying the blt - set produces hemisystems of the resulting nonclassical flock generalised quadrangles .",
    "our construction produces a considerable number of non - isomorphic hemisystems of flock generalised quadrangles , but computer work ( reported in @xcite ) shows that not every hemisystem arises from this method .",
    "as mentioned earlier , hemisystems produce partial quadrangles .",
    "partial quadrangles were introduced by peter j. cameron @xcite as a geometry of points and lines such that every two points are on at most one line , there are no triangles , every line has the same number @xmath10 of points , every point is incident with the same number @xmath11 of lines , and there is a constant @xmath12 such that for every pair of noncollinear points there are precisely @xmath12 points collinear to both .",
    "it follows directly from these conditions that the point graph of this geometry is strongly regular with parameters give us the number of vertices @xmath13 , the valency @xmath14 , and the constants @xmath15 and @xmath12 are the number of vertices adjacent to a pair of adjacent or nonadjacent vertices , respectively . ]",
    "@xmath16 in fact , generalised quadrangles themselves are partial quadrangles with @xmath17 , that is , they satisfy the extra condition that for every point @xmath18 and line @xmath19 which are not incident , there is a unique point of @xmath19 collinear with @xmath18 .",
    "the only known partial quadrangles which are not generalised quadrangles are :    * one of the seven known triangle - free strongly regular graphs , * one of three exceptional examples arising from caps of projective spaces , * those which arise from removing a point and its incident lines from a generalised quadrangle of order @xmath20 , or lastly , * those which arise from a _ hemisystem _ of a generalised quadrangle of order @xmath4 , @xmath5 odd .    a partial quadrangle arising from a hemisystem has parameters @xmath21 .",
    "finally , in the appendix , we provide a new proof that a hemisystem of a generalised quadrangle of order @xmath4 , @xmath5 odd , gives rise to a partial quadrangle .",
    "the method of @xcite was to show that the adjacency matrix of the point graph had three distinct eigenvalues , whereas we adopt a more direct approach and make use of some basic algebraic combinatorics .",
    "by a theorem of jacques tits , every finite polar space is either a generalised quadrangle or arises from a finite vector space equipped with a non - degenerate reflexive sesquilinear form or a quadratic form . by witt s theorem ,",
    "the maximal totally isotropic subspaces have the same algebraic dimension , which is called the _",
    "rank _ of the polar space .",
    "we will assume that the reader is familiar with the fundamental theory of polar spaces , and we refer the reader to @xcite for more details .",
    "if we take the totally isotropic subspaces containing a given subspace of a finite polar space , we obtain the _ quotient _ polar space of the same type but lesser rank .",
    "we use projective notation for polar spaces so that they differ from the standard notation for their collineation groups .",
    "for example , the notation @xmath22 denotes the symplectic polar space derived from the vector space @xmath23 equipped with a non - degenerate alternating form .",
    "here is a summary of the notation we will use for polar spaces .",
    ".notation for the finite polar spaces .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ cphemi2 ] consider the @xmath24 points @xmath25 of @xmath9 obtained by field reduction to @xmath26 and projection to @xmath9 as described above .",
    "then @xmath25 spans a solid whose image under the null polarity is a totally isotropic line @xmath19 of @xmath9 . for a subset @xmath27 of the totally isotropic planes on @xmath19 , let @xmath28 be the totally isotropic planes of @xmath9 that meet some element of @xmath29 in a line , and that meet some element of @xmath27 in a point .",
    "let @xmath30 be the set of ( t.i . )",
    "planes on @xmath19 that meet some element of @xmath31 in a point .",
    "then @xmath30 has size @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "first we show that @xmath25 spans a solid whose perp is a totally isotropic line of @xmath9 .",
    "recall from the discussion in section [ tensor ] that we can write our @xmath35-dimensional vector space @xmath36 as @xmath37 where @xmath38 carries a symmetric bilinear form of minus type ( and is @xmath8-dimensional ) and @xmath39 carries an alternating bilinear form ( and is @xmath40-dimensional ) such that the `` product '' of these two forms defines a non - degenerate alternating bilinear form on @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath41 be a totally singular vector with respect to the elliptic form on @xmath38 .",
    "then @xmath42 is a totally isotropic line in @xmath36 with respect to @xmath43 , and so we will identify @xmath44 with @xmath45 . fix @xmath46 and",
    "let @xmath47 .",
    "then @xmath48 is a hyperplane containing @xmath49 .",
    "we can also find an element @xmath50 such that @xmath51 .",
    "then @xmath52 .",
    "hence @xmath53 .",
    "now we may write the image of our elliptic quadric as @xmath54 then for @xmath55 we have @xmath56 the only totally singular point in @xmath57 is @xmath58 , so @xmath59 which is a 4-dimensional projective space whose perp is a totally isotropic plane of @xmath26 .",
    "so returning to our model , we can substitute in this argument @xmath60 for the the hyperplane @xmath61 in the knarr model ( [ rhoequation ] ) and we see that @xmath25 spans a solid whose perp is a totally isotropic line @xmath19 of @xmath9 .    now consider the set @xmath30 of totally isotropic planes on @xmath19 that meet some element of @xmath31 in a point .",
    "first note that for every line @xmath62 of @xmath1 , we have that @xmath63 meets @xmath64 in a point ( n.b .",
    ", @xmath65 now denotes the polarity defining @xmath9 ) .",
    "moreover , if @xmath62 is a tangent line to @xmath66 , then @xmath67 .",
    "now @xmath68 contains the line @xmath69 , and the other lines @xmath70 meet the totally isotropic solid @xmath71 in a point .",
    "so @xmath25 consists precisely of the point @xmath44 and the points of the totally isotropic plane @xmath72 which are not on @xmath19 .",
    "this plane @xmath72 is incident with @xmath19 , so we know that just two of the planes on @xmath19 meet the images of tangent lines under @xmath73 , whereas the remaining @xmath74 planes meet the images of external lines .",
    "it is then not difficult to ascertain that half of these @xmath74 planes are the elements of @xmath30 .    by definition",
    ", @xmath75 is the image of @xmath76 under @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath77 , that is , @xmath78 and @xmath62 meets some element of @xmath79 in a point @xmath80 .",
    "then @xmath81 is a solid meeting the solid @xmath82 in the line @xmath83 .",
    "so @xmath63 is a plane meeting an element of @xmath75 in @xmath84 , the latter being a line as @xmath85 .",
    "now @xmath63 meets @xmath64 in a point , and so there is a unique totally isotropic plane on @xmath19 which meets @xmath63 in a point , namely @xmath86 . by definition , this plane must be an element of @xmath30 , and hence , @xmath87 .",
    "it is not difficult to show that the cardinalities of @xmath88 and @xmath89 are equal to @xmath90 and hence @xmath33 . by a similar argument",
    ", we have that @xmath34 .",
    "the cossidente - penttila hemisystem of @xmath1 can be described as @xmath91 in the knarr model @xmath92 of @xmath1 , that is , the cossidente - penttila hemisystems occur as examples of output of our construction [ construction ] .",
    "let @xmath93 be a generalised quadrangle of order @xmath20 , @xmath94 odd .",
    "if @xmath95 is the set of points of @xmath93 , then the algebra @xmath96 of functions from @xmath95 to @xmath97 decomposes into an orthogonal decomposition of three irreducible subspaces @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , which are in fact eigenspaces for the adjacency matrix of @xmath93 with eigenvalues @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath98 is just the subspace of constant functions from @xmath95 to @xmath97 , which is spanned by the all - one function @xmath104",
    ". we will be considering multisets of elements of @xmath95 , that is , functions from @xmath95 to the non - negative integers @xmath105 . to make our notation simpler",
    ", we will avoid using the symbol `` chi '' and a subscript for the characteristic function of a multiset , rather we will simply use the multiset itself if it is clear that we are using it as an element of @xmath96 .    a _ weighted tight set _ is any multiset @xmath13 of @xmath106 such that @xmath107 .",
    "similarly , a _ weighted @xmath62-ovoid _ is any multiset residing in @xmath108 .",
    "an example of a weighted @xmath62-ovoid is a _ hemisystem of points _ of a generalised quadrangle ; the dual notion of a hemisystem of lines ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 1 ) ) .",
    "the scalar product @xmath109 of two multisets @xmath110 and @xmath43 gives us the function @xmath111 , which one can think of as the generalisation of the intersection of two sets .",
    "therefore , we write @xmath112 for @xmath113 .",
    "so suppose we have a weighted tight set @xmath114 and a weighted @xmath62-ovoid @xmath115 .",
    "then by orthogonal projection , we see that @xmath116 and hence these two vectors are orthogonal to one another .",
    "this observation then implies that @xmath114 and @xmath115 meet in a number of elements determined by their sizes : @xmath117 ( note that @xmath118 is simply the number @xmath119 of points of @xmath93 ) .",
    "let @xmath120 and @xmath121 be two noncollinear points of @xmath93 and consider the multiset @xmath122 of points consisting of @xmath123 and @xmath5 copies of @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "then @xmath122 is a weighted tight set .",
    "consider the function @xmath124 .",
    "we will show that @xmath13 is an eigenvector of the adjacency matrix @xmath110 with eigenvalue @xmath102 .",
    "now we collect a few formulae which are simple to demonstrate with geometric arguments , plus the fact that the size of @xmath125 is @xmath10 , where @xmath126 are pairwise noncollinear ( see @xcite ) : @xmath127 so @xmath128 it then follows that @xmath13 is an eigenvector of the adjacency matrix @xmath110 with eigenvalue @xmath102 .",
    "let @xmath7 be a set of points of @xmath93 giving rise to a hemisystem of the dual of @xmath93 .",
    "then the geometry @xmath129 obtained by restricting the point - set of @xmath93 to @xmath7 is a partial quadrangle .    clearly",
    "every two points of @xmath129 share at most one line and there are no triangles in @xmath129 , so it suffices to prove the `` @xmath12 condition '' .",
    "let @xmath130 be two arbitrary noncollinear points in @xmath7 and let @xmath12 be the number of points of @xmath7 which are collinear to both @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "note that @xmath131 consists of @xmath132 points in @xmath93 .",
    "we simply use the above lemma to show that @xmath12 is independent of the choice of @xmath120 and @xmath121 . consider the multiset @xmath122 of points consisting of @xmath123 and @xmath5 copies of @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "so in other words , this multiset can be expressed by @xmath133 .",
    "simply note now that @xmath134 and hence @xmath135 . therefore @xmath129 is a partial quadrangle ."
