    "the cross section being the most important quantity for description and interpretation of physics underlying interactions of particles connects theory and experiment .",
    "accurate knowledge on it is therefore very important for deeper understanding already well established theories like the standard model as well as for search of new physics .",
    "the effective lagrangian of the leptoquark model proposed by buchmller , rckl and wyler in 1986  @xcite obeys the symmetries of the standard model gauge groups @xmath2 .",
    "therefore one may expect that dynamics of some processes in these models can formally coincide so that the calculated cross sections turn out also to be the same up to constant factors associated with different couplings .",
    "this letter shows that exclusive production of @xmath0 bosons in neutrino ",
    "photon scattering and production of vector leptoquarks in electron ",
    "gluon collisions represent such a situation in the leading order of perturbation theory provided the leptoquarks minimally couple to the gauge fields of the standard model .",
    "the cross sections of both reactions are calculated analytically . a significant difference between the result of this letter and previous analysis of the leptoquark production",
    "following  @xcite let us also postulate the lagrangian with minimal couplings between vector leptoquarks and the neutral gauge bosons of the standard model :    @xmath3,\\label{lagrange}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 is the field strength tensor of vector leptoquarks , @xmath5 are the field strength tensors of the neutral gauge fields of the standard model , @xmath6 are the coupling constants for the interactions between these gauge fields and the leptoquarks .",
    "the covariant derivative @xmath7 is defined by    @xmath8    here @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the photon , @xmath12 boson and gluon fields , respectively ; @xmath13 is the elementary electric charge , @xmath14 denotes the electric charge of a leptoquark , @xmath15 is the strong coupling constant , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the third component of the weak isospin , @xmath18 is the weinberg angle ) , @xmath19 are the gell - mann matrices .    from ( [ lagrange ] )",
    "it follows that the feynman rules for the @xmath20 and @xmath21 vertices are similar to the @xmath22 @xmath23 ones  @xcite .",
    "the couplings of vector leptoquarks to the gluon fields have also analogy with the self - interaction of the gluons .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the explicit form of the feynman rules for the @xmath23 and @xmath24 vertices are given .",
    "one can see that they differ only by constant factors .",
    "let us consider two exclusive reactions .",
    "the first one is the @xmath0  production in neutrino ",
    "photon scattering allowed by the standard model @xcite :    @xmath25    where @xmath26e@xmath27 .",
    "the second one is production of vector leptoquarks ( @xmath28 ) in interactions of left / right polarized electrons with gluons appearing in the buchmller ",
    "rckl  wyler leptoquark model  @xcite :    @xmath29    the reactions ( [ reac1 ] ) and ( [ reac2 ] ) are closely related to each other from a formal point of view . to illustrate this , it is convenient to represent the considered interactions in the form of the feynman diagrams so that the amplitudes contributing to ( [ reac1 ] ) and ( [ reac2 ] ) will look as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , respectively @xcite .",
    "the leptoquark lagrangian has such symmetry properties that the feynman rules for the vertices @xmath30 respectively coincide in their structure with those of the standard model for the vertices @xmath31 up to constant factors ( see fig .",
    "[ fig44 ] ) . as to the familiar rules corresponding to the @xmath32 and @xmath33 vertices",
    ", they also differ from each other only by the coupling constants and the color coefficients .",
    "this means that in the limit of massless initial state leptons the leading order cross sections of the reactions ( [ reac1 ] ) and ( [ reac2 ] ) will have exactly the same dependence on the mandelstam variables and on the masses of the final state particles differing from each other only by a constant as well .",
    "such relations between processes are well known in quantum field theory .",
    "most simple qcd diagrams are exactly analogous to qed diagrams , and the qcd cross section is obtainable by appropriate replacements of the coupling constants in the qed one corresponding to the replacement of the photon by a gluon  @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the leading order cross sections of the reactions ( [ reac1 ] ) and ( [ reac2 ] ) , where @xmath36 is the center - of - mass ( cm ) energy squared , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the masses of the final state particles .",
    "then , in accordance with the above discussion , they must satisfy the following condition :    @xmath39    note that both cross sections in ( [ ratio1 ] ) are taken with the same values of the masses .",
    "therefore , it is enough to know one of the cross sections to find the other .",
    "the cross section of the reaction ( [ reac2 ] ) is calculated using the diagrams from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] with the corresponding feynman rules given in figs .",
    "[ fig1](b ) and [ fig44](b ) .",

    "the similarity between the cross sections of the reactions ( [ reac1 ] ) and ( [ reac2 ] ) discussed in section  [ problem ] allows to verify the validity of the cross section  ( [ result ] ) .",
    "actually , the problem of calculation of @xmath34 is now reduced to just performing the following obvious replacements of the coupling constants and the masses of the final state particles in ( [ result ] ) :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the coupling of the weak charged current ( related to the fermi coupling constant @xmath47 by @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the fine structure constant .",
    "note that the coefficient of @xmath50 is the color factor equal to @xmath51 for the process  ( [ reac2 ] ) .",
    "so that one finds    @xmath52    the cross section for the reaction ( [ reac1 ] ) in the leading order has also been independently calculated in @xcite , however in such a way that the masses of the final state leptons were neglected ( let us denote this cross section by @xmath53 ) .",
    "this means that ( [ result2 ] ) obtained in this letter and the result of  @xcite must asymptotically coincide satisfying the following condition :    @xmath54    it should be emphasized that ( [ ratio2 ] ) is a criterion to verify the validity of the cross sections obtained in the present letter .",
    "figure [ fig55 ] shows that ( [ ratio2 ] ) is fulfilled as it must be in the case of correct calculations . moreover , there is a perfect coincidence between ( [ result2 ] ) and @xmath53 over the entire range of the energy for the case of the electron in the final state owing to the vanishing electron mass in comparison with  @xmath55 .",
    "the cross section for the reaction ( [ reac2 ] ) in the leading order has also been calculated in @xcite whose result ( let us denote it by @xmath56 ) significantly differs from ( [ result ] ) .",
    "this fact is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where dependences of both cross sections on the cm energy are shown for production of the @xmath57 and @xmath58 type vector leptoquarks of mass 1000 gev at @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the difference is more brightly reflected by the ratio of @xmath56 to @xmath35 shown in fig .",
    "one can see that there may be cases in which the cross section ( [ result ] ) exceeds the corresponding quantity from @xcite by about a factor of two .",
    "this is because different choices of the lagrangian responsible for interaction of the leptoquarks with the gluon fields which lead to different feynman rules for the @xmath24 vertex @xcite . in the present letter",
    "the minimal couplings of the leptoquarks to the gauge fields of the standard model are assumed while in  @xcite the lagrangian with anomalous interaction terms is used  @xcite .",
