    "s approach , emphasizing the different steps in the construction of thermodynamic functions .",
    "the method will be exemplified discussing in detail the three - state potts model with infinite range interactions .",
    "this simple example has been recently used as a toy model to illustrate peculiar thermodynamic properties of long - range systems  @xcite .",
    "the diluted three - state potts model with short - range interactions has also been studied in connection with `` small '' systems thermodynamics by gross  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the three - state potts model is @xmath52 the @xmath53 prefactor is introduced in order to keep energy extensive  @xcite .",
    "each lattice site @xmath54 is occupied by a spin variable @xmath55 , which assumes three different states @xmath56 , @xmath57 , or @xmath58 .",
    "a pair of spins gives a ferromagnetic contribution @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) to the total energy if they are in the same state , and no contribution otherwise .",
    "it is important to stress that the energy sum is extended over _ all _ pairs @xmath61 : the interaction is infinite range .",
    "the solution method consists of three steps .",
    "* step 1  : identifying global variables *    let @xmath62 be the phase - space of a @xmath8-particles system with hamiltonian @xmath63 and @xmath64 be a specific microscopic configuration .",
    "the first step of the method consists in associating to every microscopic configuration @xmath65 , a global ( coarse - grained ) variable , @xmath66 .",
    "then , a new hamiltonian @xmath67 can be defined @xmath68 if one can neglect @xmath69 with respect to @xmath67 in the large @xmath8-limit , then the hamiltonian can be expressed only in terms of the global variables . when considering the above defined infinite range potts model ,",
    "the appropriate global variable is @xmath70 where @xmath71 are the fractions of spins in the three different states @xmath72 . in this case , the hamiltonian expressed in terms of the global variable is @xmath73 and coincides with the original hamiltonian @xmath74 even at finite  @xmath8 . in section  [ exemple_alphaising ]",
    ", we will discuss the @xmath0-ising model , for which  @xmath75 does not vanish .",
    "the global variable @xmath76 is of finite dimension in our example , but could be of infinite dimension in other cases .",
    "for instance , @xmath76 could correspond to a local mass density in a gravitational system , or a coarse - grained vorticity density in 2d turbulence .",
    "although this type of redefinition of the hamiltonian might appear to be possible in all cases , this is not true .",
    "for instance , in the case of short - range interactions , even after defining a local density of a physical quantity ( e.g. magnetization ) , when performing the large @xmath8-limit , no general argument exists to neglect  @xmath75 . as a consequence , in such a case ,",
    "the local density ( e.g. the local magnetization ) is not the appropriate macroscopic variable .",
    "however we will argue that such a procedure is , instead , viable in general for systems with long - range interactions on a lattice .",
    "keeping the lattice spacing finite is important in order to regularize possible short distance singularities .    because the mean - field variables are not equiprobable , the number of microscopic configurations leading to a given value of @xmath76 does depend on @xmath76 itself",
    "then , one can define an entropy functional  @xmath77 , @xmath78 where the boltzmann constant has been set to unity , @xmath79 is the number of microscopic configurations corresponding to a given value of  @xmath76 , @xmath80 is the rate function and @xmath81 is the total number of states .",
    "this is where large deviation theory applies ; not only in proving that such an entropy functional exists , but also in providing a procedure to derive it explicitly .    if , besides the dynamical variables which contribute to the global ones , the hamiltonian depends also on a number of variables @xmath82 which is small with respect to @xmath8 , it is easy to prove that these additional variables contribute to the entropy for a negligible term , proportional to @xmath83 .    for the infinite range potts model ,",
    "it is possible to derive the entropy functional @xmath84 directly , using combinatorial arguments and the stirling approximation in the large @xmath8-limit .",
    "however , let us follow instead the procedure given by cramr s theorem as explained in section  [ how ] .",
    "expression  ( [ muvarpotts ] ) for @xmath76 , which is identified with @xmath20 in section  [ how ] , can be rewritten as @xmath85 the local random variables with common probability distribution are here @xmath86 hence , the generating function @xmath87 is given by @xmath88 the large deviation functional is @xmath89 this variational problem can be solved exactly , giving @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "hence , @xmath92 thermodynamic entropy density is given by @xmath93 , where the normalization factor is @xmath94 for the potts model example , which recovers the result of the combinatorial approach .    * step 3  : microcanonical and canonical variational problems *    to obtain the entropy as a function of energy density @xmath95 , _",
    "i.e. _ to solve a model in the microcanonical ensemble , after performing steps 1 and 2 of the solution method , one has to find the solution of the following variational problem  @xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 this result is exact but it corresponds also to an `` intuitive '' mean - field solution .",
    "finally , let us notice that the total entropy density is intensive : there is no difference in this respect with short - range interacting systems .",
    "when other conserved quantities exist , they must be taken into account when solving the variational problem in formula  ( [ varprobleme_micro ] ) .",
    "specific examples will be discussed in sections  ( [ exemple_hmf ] ) and  ( [ colson - bonifaciomodel ] ) .    for the infinite range potts model  ( [ hpotts3 ] ) , the variational problem is @xmath98 this variational problem can be solved numerically .",
    "the microcanonical inverse temperature @xmath99 can then be derived : it is shown in fig .",
    "[ potts_fig ] in the allowed energy range @xmath100 $ ] .",

    "let us now consider the canonical ensemble .",
    "the partition function , written in terms of the common probability distribution of the phase - space variables , is @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the probability density of @xmath9 .",
    "this is not the usual partition function , but differs from it only for a constant factor , which counts the number of states .",
    "let us remark that we have also used the letter @xmath104 for the microcanonical inverse temperature .",
    "we will comment specifically when the microcanonical inverse temperature differs from the canonical one due to ensemble inequivalence .",
    "approximating hamiltonian @xmath105 in the large @xmath8-limit with the one expressed in terms of the global variable @xmath106 , one gets @xmath107    for infinite range models , formula ( [ equation32 ] ) is exact for all @xmath8 because the rest @xmath75 vanishes .",
    "using formula ( [ largedev ] ) , one obtains @xmath108 applying the saddle point method , the partition function is rewritten as @xmath109 where the `` free energy '' @xmath110 is obtained solving the variational problem @xmath111 our `` free energy '' is the usual free energy multiplied by the inverse temperature .",
    "this helps because physical states will correspond to minima of such free energy also for negative inverse temperatures .    in the case of the infinite range three - state potts model",
    ", the canonical free energy can be explicitly derived solving the following variational problem @xmath112 to obtain the caloric curve , one has to compute @xmath113 .",
    "[ potts_fig ] shows that at the canonical transition inverse temperature @xmath114 , corresponding to the energy @xmath115 , a first order phase transition appears , with an associated latent heat .",

    "[ potts_fig ] , the two dotted regions have the same area , respecting maxwell s construction . at the inverse transition temperature , there is also a jump in the global variables @xmath117 which are the order parameters of the model .",
    "this extremely simple example shows already _",
    "ensemble inequivalence_. in the microcanonical ensemble , there is no phase transition and the specific heat becomes negative . on the other hand , in the canonical ensemble , there is a first order phase transition with a latent heat .",
    "the caloric curves do not coincide .",
    "we observe that in the energy range of ensemble inequivalence , microcanonical temperatures , @xmath118 , do not coincide with any canonical one .",
    "this is an example of the more general fact that entropy @xmath119 is not always the legendre - fenchel transform of the free energy @xmath110 .",
    "a general discussion of ensemble inequivalence , both at the thermodynamic level and at the level of equilibrium macrostates , is provided in refs .",
    "@xcite , while a classification of phase transition and of ensemble inequivalence situations is reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this concludes the general presentation of the different steps of the method to derive the statistical mechanics of long - range interacting systems .",
    "in this section , we will discuss the application of the large deviation method to two examples which share the difficulty of computing the entropy for a phase - space with _ continuous _ variables . when presenting the method , we have discussed in parallel its application to a model with _",
    "variables , the infinite range three - state potts model , which however could have been solved by direct states counting  @xcite .",
    "this latter approach can not be used when the variables are continuous .",
    "obtaining microcanonical entropy often implies the solution of too complicated integrals , and indeed one does not find many examples of such solutions in the literature . on the contrary ,",
    "the large deviation method is not restricted to discrete variables and we will show that it can even be simpler to use in such a case .",

    "this system can be seen as representing particles moving on a unit circle interacting via an infinite range attractive ( @xmath123 ) or repulsive ( @xmath124 ) cosine potential or , alternatively , as classical xy - rotors with infinite range ferromagnetic ( @xmath123 ) or antiferromagnetic ( @xmath124 ) couplings .",
    "the renormalization factor @xmath8 of the potential energy is kept not only for historical reasons , but also because it simplifies the derivation of the variational problems and makes the problem well defined . as we will see , this implies that the usual energy per particle and temperature are well defined in the @xmath125 limit . in the literature , some authors have treated the case in which the energy is not extensive .",

    "<S> , we will then treat infinite range models with continuous variables . </S>",
    "<S> we will present in section  [ exemple_hmf ] the solution of the hmf model  @xcite in the microcanonical ensemble and , in the following section  [ colson - bonifaciomodel ] , we will consider the colson - bonifacio model of free electron lasers ( fel )  @xcite , as an example of relevance for physical applications . in section  [ exemple_alphaising ] , we will show that these techniques can be applied also to cases where the interaction is not infinite range but distance dependent ; the solution of the so - called @xmath0-ising model  @xcite , in one dimension with @xmath7 , will be presented in full detail , allowing us to discuss also the role of boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , section [ remarques ] will be devoted to conclusions and perspectives . </S>"
