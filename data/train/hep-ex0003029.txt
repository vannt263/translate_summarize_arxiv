    "recently , there has been much discussion regarding the possibility that bose - einstein correlations and other interconnection effects between decay products of different strings could affect the measurement of the @xmath2 mass @xcite .",
    "since measurements are hampered by low statistics and experimental difficulties @xcite , the question arises whether and where effects of the superposition of several strings can be tested independently . within the dual parton model @xcite for hadron - hadron reactions , the charged - particle multiplicity n",
    "is expected to rise with the number of strings .",
    "the decrease in the observed correlation strength @xmath3 of the bose - einstein effect as function of multiplicity @xcite may be explained in terms of products of different strings , where each string symmetrizes separately  @xcite . to test this idea",
    "further , it is desirable to investigate quantitatively the multiplicity dependence of like - sign particle correlations .",
    "improvements in experimental analysis techniques @xcite and larger data samples make it possible to repeat and extend bose - einstein analyses with an advanced strategy .",
    "@xcite in this letter , we investigate correlation functions of particle pairs with like - sign ( @xmath4 ) and opposite - sign ( @xmath5 ) charges at different total charged - particle multiplicities with the same model - independent strategy and good statistics . the bias introduced by selecting events of a given overall multiplicity",
    "is eliminated with the use of `` internal cumulants ''  @xcite .",
    "the data sample consists of 1,200,000 non - single - diffractive @xmath0 reactions at @xmath1  gev measured by the ua1 central detector  @xcite .",
    "only vertex - associated charged tracks with transverse momentum @xmath6  gev / c , @xmath7 , good measurement quality and fitted length @xmath8 30 cm have been used . to avoid acceptance problems , we restrict the azimuthal angle to @xmath9 ( `` good azimuth '' ) . since , however , the multiplicity for the entire azimuthal range is the physically relevant quantity , we select events according to their uncorrected all - azimuth charged - particle multiplicity @xmath10 . the corrected multiplicity density is then estimated as twice @xmath11 , the charged - particle multiplicity in good azimuth : @xmath12 .",
    "all quantities measured are defined in the notation of correlation integrals  @xcite , @xmath13      \\over      \\int_\\omega d^3\\bp_1\\ , d^3\\bp_2\\ , \\rho_1(\\bp_1)\\ ,           \\rho_1(\\bp_2)\\ ,                        \\delta \\left[q - q(\\bp_1,\\bp_2 ) \\right ] } \\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath14 the three - momenta , @xmath15 the corresponding four - momenta , and @xmath16 . as usual",

    "the integration region @xmath19 is identical with our experimental cuts as specified above and specifically refers to the good - azimuth region .",
    "all particles have been assumed to be pions .    in @xmath0 reactions and in full phase space ,",
    "the number of positive and negative particles are equal , as are the corresponding one - and two - particle densities @xmath20 , @xmath21 . given the charged particle density @xmath22 , we hence assume that @xmath23 and therefore also @xmath24 etc . the like - sign and opposite - sign normalised two - particle densities become , respectively ,",
    "@xmath25 fig .",
    "1 shows the normalized density correlation functions @xmath26 for pairs of like - sign ( @xmath4 ) charge and for opposite - sign ( @xmath5 ) charge separately . restricting the total uncorrected charged - particle multiplicity @xmath10 in @xmath7 to the windows @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "1a ) and @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "1b ) , one obtains for the corrected particle density in the central rapidity region @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "both the like - sign and opposite - sign correlation densities show a strong dependence on multiplicity",
    ". tends to a constant for large @xmath31 , ie .",
    "@xmath32 = constant .",
    "it should be clear from figure 1 that no such constancy exists for limited - multiplicity windows . ]",
    "while the multiplicity dependence of @xmath26 is of much interest , a quantitative analysis must both remove combinatorial background by calculating the cumulants and also correct for the bias introduced by working at fixed multiplicity .",
    "this bias arises because at fixed total multiplicity @xmath10 , standard second - order factorial cumulants , defined by @xmath33 are nonzero even when particles are completely uncorrelated ; for example , for purely uncorrelated multinomially - distributed events , @xmath34 because these correlations result solely from the restriction of the sample to a fixed multiplicity , they are termed `` external '' and should be removed .",
    "the `` internal cumulants '' of ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath35 correct this bias exactly : they are zero whenever the @xmath10 particles behave multinomially .",
    "the following arguments lead to a unique choice of normalization @xmath36 .",
    "the correctly normalized internal cumulants @xmath37 should be independent of multiplicity @xmath10 whenever @xmath38 and @xmath39 depend on @xmath10 only globally i.e.  have the same shapes ( in terms of the momenta ) for different @xmath10 . such `` shape constancy '' , @xmath40 coupled to the requirement that @xmath41 fixes the appropriate normalisation to be @xmath42 the quantity to which @xmath21 defaults when @xmath43 and @xmath44 become statistically independent .",
    "the correctly normalized internal cumulant at fixed multiplicity consequently reads @xmath45 extending these arguments to multiplicity ranges @xmath46 $ ] , specifying them for different charge combinations and adopting the correlation integral eq .",
    "( [ ptoq ] ) , we arrive at our measurement prescription for the normalized internal cumulants for @xmath4 and @xmath5 pairs , @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the mean numbers of positive or negative particles , @xmath5 pairs and @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 ) pairs respectively in the whole interval @xmath19 and in the multiplicity range @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "( [ se ] ) and ( [ se1 ] ) are obtained @xcite by assuming shape constancy for all averaging proceduresthe renormalization factors in front of @xmath26 were used in ref @xcite and elsewhere . here , they are derived from eqs .",
    "( [ sa1 ] ) , ( [ sa2 ] ) and the requirement ( [ sc ] ) ..    since all quantities shown here and below are to be understood as mean values in multiplicity ranges , we henceforth ( and in fig .",
    "1 ) omit the bar on the symbols .",
    "2 shows both like- and opposite - sign internal cumulants for two selections of @xmath54 .",
    "three features are apparent :    * the importance of changing from @xmath26 to @xmath55 lies in the fact that the latter demarcate clearly the `` line of no correlation '' which , due to the fixed - multiplicity conditioning , is not equal to unity for @xmath26 in fig . 1a . *",
    "internal cumulants integrate to zero over the entire phase space ; hence the positive part of @xmath55 at small @xmath31 is compensated by a negative part at larger @xmath31 .",
    "physically , this means that particles like to cluster , so that there is a surfeit of pairs at small @xmath31 and a dearth of pairs at large @xmath31 compared to the uncorrelated case . *",
    "the dependencies of the like- and opposite - sign cumulants on multiplicity are rather similar in that both decrease markedly with @xmath54 .",
    "this is discussed more fully below .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath56 and @xmath57 as a function of @xmath54 suggests that both could have approximately the same functional dependence @xmath58 on multiplicity density . under this hypothesis , where both depend on @xmath54 with the same functional form instead of @xmath54 here and below",
    "] , @xmath59 the quotient of the cumulants should be independent of multiplicity , @xmath60 figure 3a shows that ( [ eqn13 ] ) holds approximately .",
    "( in the region where both cumulants are near zero , no meaningful quotients can be formed . )    having shown that like- and unlike - sign internal cumulants behave approximately in the same way as functions of @xmath54 , we now look for an appropriate functional form for this dependence .",
    "a first hypothesis is that @xmath55 depends inversely on @xmath61 , @xmath62 this can be motivated theoretically by    * * resonances : * if the unnormalized cumulants @xmath63 and @xmath64 were wholly the result of resonance decays and if the number of resonances were proportional to the multiplicity @xmath61 , then @xmath65 . assuming shape constancy @xmath66 gives @xmath67 , and hence after normalization , the resonance - inspired guess is @xmath68 * * independent superposition * in momentum space of @xmath69 equal strings would also lead to @xmath70 .",
    "deviations can occur if the strings are unequal or if there is no strong proportionality between @xmath69 and @xmath61 .",
    "( [ eqnff ] ) implies that @xmath71 ( constant in @xmath31 ) for two multiplicities @xmath72 and @xmath73 for the same @xmath74 ( @xmath75 or @xmath5 ) . in fig .",
    "3b , we show the quotient of cumulants for two multiplicities .",
    "surprisingly , we find not one but two regions of approximate constancy in @xmath31 , one for small @xmath76  gev , one for large @xmath77  gev , where only the latter corresponds to the value @xmath78 expected from ( [ eqnff ] ) , shown as the dotted line . at small @xmath31",
    ", one must clearly look for other functional forms for @xmath79 .",
    "some phenomenological guesses are as follows .",
    "* in the * quantum statistical approach * of bose - einstein correlations @xcite , no multiplicity dependence is expected with our renormalization of @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ se ] ) . *",
    "a mixture of processes a ) and c ) could result in a dependence @xmath80 however , no comparable picture is available for the unlike - sign case .    in order to test the above ideas , we plot the cumulants against @xmath81 as follows . to avoid local statistical fluctuations , the normalized cumulants @xmath82 and",
    "@xmath83 are fitted with suitable functions in restricted @xmath31-ranges for each @xmath54 ( not shown ) .",
    "the best - fit values at small @xmath31 ( 0.1 gev / c ) and at large @xmath31 ( 7 gev / c ) are plotted in figs .",
    "4a and 4b respectively .",
    "the @xmath84 have also been fitted to an exponential parametrization for @xmath85  gev / c , @xmath86 since the reported increase @xcite of the radius r in case of @xmath4 ( bose - einstein ) functions could cause part of the decrease with @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath3 values obtained are thus corrected for effects of varying radii , but still indicate a pronounced multiplicity dependence ( crosses in fig .",
    "4a ) similar to the model - independent cumulants ( filled circles ) from the fit to eq .",
    "( [ eqn14 ] ) increase by about 30% over the range of @xmath54 considered . a stronger dependence of @xmath87 on multiplicity and strongly decreasing @xmath3 values have been observed when fitting gaussian functions @xcite and extending the fit range to 2 gev / c .",
    "this indicates the dependence of the results on the choice of fit functions and regions . here , we are emphasizing the region of small @xmath31 where gaussian fits fail completely @xcite . ] .",
    "4 shows that , as in fig .",
    "3b , the @xmath88-dependence is satisfied only for large but not for small @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath89 dependence in fig .",
    "4a ( solid line ) provides a possible , but hardly unique , explanation .",
    "the important region around @xmath90  gev , where the phase space contributes maximally @xcite is unfortunately difficult to investigate , because there the @xmath91 are decreasing rapidly with increasing @xmath31 while the @xmath92 are already small ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "a @xmath93-dependence ( due to resonances such as @xmath94 ) in this dominant region around 1 gev / c could presumably cause the large-@xmath31 region to follow suit via missing pairs .",
    "the multiplicity dependence of like - sign and opposite - sign two - body correlation functions have been studied with the same model - independent strategy . the bias introduced by selecting events of a given overall multiplicity",
    "is eliminated by measuring internal cumulants .",
    "we observe that    * the like - sign and opposite - sign cumulants have very similar multiplicity dependence , * there exist two regions , one at small @xmath31 , where the multiplicity dependence of both is weaker than @xmath93 , and one at large @xmath95  gev / c ) , where the cumulants are negative and follow roughly an @xmath93 law , * a third region arround @xmath31 = 1  gev / c shows small and rapidly changing cumulants .",
    "the decrease of @xmath4 functions at small @xmath31 with increasing multiplicity favours an interpretation in terms of a suppression of bose - einstein correlations between products of different strings . in the dual parton model approach @xcite ,",
    "multiparton collisions corresponding to multipomeron exchange are expected to contribute to the inelastic cross section .",
    "the observed energy dependence of multiplicity distributions supports this view @xcite .",
    "up to 2 - 3 pomeron exchanges might occur at our highest multiplicities .",
    "this could explain quantitatively the corresponding suppression of @xmath4 ( bose - einstein ) functions in fig .",
    "this interpretation is not unique . adopting e.g.  the `` core - halo picture '' @xcite",
    ", one could explain the observations by assuming that long - lived resonances ( such as the @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) are produced more frequently at larger @xmath61 thereby increase the relative strength of the halo @xcite and hence do not contribute to bose - einstein correlations .",
    "resonance decays ( regge terms ) should arguably also contribute to @xmath4-functions @xcite .",
    "one could therefore try to explain alternatively the decrease of @xmath4 functions with @xmath61 by a mixture of bose - einstein correlations ( assumed to be constant in @xmath61 ) with resonance production .",
    "all this leaves unexplained , however , the similar behaviour of @xmath5 and @xmath4 functions .",
    "theoretical work @xcite is challenged by the above experimental results .",
    "together with the results of other reactions , they represent a new piece of information @xcite in the colourful puzzle of multiparticle production .",
