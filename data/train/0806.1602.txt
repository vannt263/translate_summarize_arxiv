    "the global function of a cellular automaton  @xmath0 is defined in the set of all configurations .",
    "this is a very different point of view than implementing an algorithm to solve a given problem . in this latter case , the initial configuration is usually finite .    in the case of the euclidean plane ,",
    "the definition of the set of configurations is very easy : it is @xmath1 , where @xmath2  is the set of states of the automaton .    in the hyperbolic plane ,",
    "see  @xcite , following what we did in  @xcite , we have the following situation : we consider that the grid is the pentagrid or the ternary heptagrid , see  @xcite .",
    "we fix a tile , which will be called the * central cell * and , around it , we dispatch @xmath3  sectors , @xmath4 : @xmath5 in the case of the pentagrid , @xmath6 in the case of the ternary heptagrid .",
    "we assume that the sectors and the central cell cover the plane and the sectors do not overlap , neither the central cell , nor other sectors : call them the * basic sectors*. denote by @xmath7 the set constituted by the central cell and @xmath3  fibonacci trees , each one spanning a basic sector .",
    "then , a configuration of a cellular automaton  @xmath0 in the hyperbolic plane can be represented as an element of  @xmath8 , where @xmath2  is the set of states of  @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath9  denotes the * local * transition function of  @xmath0 , its * global * transition function  @xmath10 is defined by : @xmath11 .    the injectivity problem for a cellular automaton consists in asking whether there is an algorithm which , applied to a description of  @xmath9 would indicate whether @xmath10  is injective or not .    in this paper",
    ", we prove that there is no such algorithm and so , the corresponding problem is undecidable .",
    "the present paper relies on a previous work by the author , see  @xcite . in this paper , we give a construction which is described in  @xcite , which yields a plane - filling path , each time we can construct a valid tiling with an exception .",
    "however , in this exceptional case , a more careful analysis of the structure of the path shows that , changing a bit the way in which triangles and trapezes are traversed by the path , it is also possible to carry out the argument which is needed to prove the undecidability of the injectivity .",
    "accordingly , we shall not repeat the construction of the interwoven triangles on which the construction of the mauve triangles rely . in section  2",
    ", we more carefully describe the construction of the path based on the mauve triangles . in section  3 ,",
    "we show how to derive the proof of the main theorem :    [ injundec ] there is no algorithm to decide whether the global transition function of a cellular automaton on the ternary heptagrid is injective or not .",
    "note that it is enough to find a particular tiling whose cellular automata have the property that the injectivity of their global function is undecidable to prove that the same property for cellular automata in the hyperbolic plane in general is also undecidable .",
    "however , it seems impossible to transfer the construction of the path which we consider in this paper to the pentagrid .",
    "remind that the mauve triangles are first constructed on the interwoven triangles .",
    "the latter triangles are obtained by the following construction , illustrated by figure  [ interwovengreen ] .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed account on the construction of the interwoven triangles and for their properties .",
    "we also refer him / her to the same papers for an account on the implementation of these triangles in the ternary heptagrid of the hyperbolic plane .    at this point",
    ", we would like to make the following remark . in  @xcite",
    ", we implement the interwoven triangles in the ternary heptagrid , using another tiling as a background .",
    "this tiling , called the * mantilla * , is a refinement of the ternary heptagrid by grouping its tile in a particular way .",
    "it is possible to implement the interwoven triangles in a simpler context of the ternary heptagrid .",
    "however , the spacing imposed by the mantilla is a good point which allows to more easily solve a few details of the implementation of the path .",
    "the construction of this tiling needs a lot of signals , which entails a huge number of tiles , around 18,000 of them , not taking into account the specific tiles devoted to the simulation of a turing machine .",
    "the construction of this paper requires much more tiles , but we shall not try to count them .",
    "110=    the mauve triangles are constructed from the interwoven ones .",
    "more precisely , we focus our attention on the red triangles only : they constitute the basis of our construction . the mauve triangles are simply obtained from the red triangles as follows .",
    "the vertex of a mauve triangle is that of a red triangle  @xmath12 .",
    "its legs follow those of  @xmath12 .",
    "they go on on the same ray after the corner of  @xmath12 , until they meet the basis of the red phantoms of the same generation as  @xmath12 which are generated by the basis of  @xmath12 . at this meeting",
    ", the legs meet the basis of the mauve triangle which coincide with the basis of the just mentioned red phantoms . in  @xcite , we thoroughly describe the construction of the mauve triangles and we refer the reader to these papers .    here",
    ", we just mention a few properties of these triangles and then , we shall use them in order to make it precise the construction of the mauve triangles and the points attached to them .      from the above construction of the mauve triangles",
    ", we may define the generations of the mauve triangles from those of the red triangles : a mauve triangle of the generation  @xmath13 is constructed on a red triangle of the generation  @xmath14 + 1 .",
    "it will be later useful to recognize the mauve triangles of generation  0 .",
    "to this aim , we define a new colour , called * mauve-0 * which is given to these triangles only .",
    "accordingly , the mauve triangles of generation  0 will be most often called * mauve-0 triangles*.    from the doubling of the height with respect to the red triangles , the mauve triangles loose the nice property that the red triangles are either embedded or disjoint .",
    "this is no more the case for the mauve triangles .",
    "however , we can precisely describe the overlapping of mauve triangles and how their intersections happen .    from  @xcite",
    ", we know that the intersection occurs by a leg of a mauve triangle cutting a basis of another mauve triangle . from the construction , any mauve triangle  @xmath15 of the generation  @xmath13 + 1 contains thee mauve triangles of the generation  @xmath13 with which they have no intersection .",
    "they also meet two mauve triangles of the previous generation .",
    "one of them is met at their basis : the legs of this triangle of the generation  @xmath13 cuts the basis of  @xmath15 .",
    "the other mauve triangle  @xmath16 of the generation  @xmath13 meets  @xmath15 near its vertex .",
    "this time , the legs of  @xmath15 cut the basis of  @xmath16 .",
    "we give a number in [ 0 .. 3 ] to the mauve triangles of the generation  @xmath13 whose vertex is contained in  @xmath15 , as four isoclines are involved by these vertices .",
    "such a number is called the * rank * of the triangles .",
    "the rank is periodically repeated on -80pt -40pt the mauve triangles of the generation  @xmath13 , to the top and to the bottom .",
    "a triangle of rank  @xmath17 is called an * @xmath17-triangle*. if a mauve triangle of the generation  @xmath13 contains  @xmath15 , it is called the * hat * of  @xmath15 : it is a 3-triangle . the hat is unique when it exists .",
    "note that if we can repeat the construction of the hat recursively until reaching a mauve-0 triangle , we obtain that the vertex of this mauve-0 triangle is at a distance at most @xmath18 of the vertex of  @xmath15 .",
    "we call the mauve-0 triangle the * remotest ancestor * of  @xmath15 , a notion already remarked for the interwoven triangles .",
    "accordingly , if the vertex of  @xmath15 is on the basis of a mauve - triangle of the same generation , then its remotest ancestor exists .",
    "the triangles of the generation  @xmath13 which cut the basis of  @xmath15 are also 3-triangles .",
    "we define the * low points * of a leg of a triangle , @xmath19 for short , as the point which is at a distance  @xmath18 from the basis of the triangle , where @xmath20  is the length of the leg .",
    "the @xmath19 s play an important role : the line which joins the  @xmath19 s of  @xmath15 cuts the 2-triangles also at their @xmath19 s .",
    "the intersection of the basis of  @xmath15 with its 3-triangles occur at their @xmath19 s .    in  @xcite ,",
    "the consideration of the @xmath17-triangles has led to the extension of the notion of latitude used in the interwoven triangles to the case of the mauve triangles .",
    "however , the definition which was there given is not satisfactory . in order to introduce a better one",
    ", we define the * primary latitude * of a mauve triangle as the set of isoclines which cross its legs , the basis being included but the top being excluded .",
    "this allows us to obtain a partition of the hyperbolic plane by the primary latitudes attached to a given generation .",
    "this defines a partition for each generation .",
    "but the primary latitudes may overlap from one generation to the next one .",
    "now , we can precisely state the properties mentioned above about the intersections between mauve triangles and we can also prove them as follows .",
    "[ innerandlp ] let @xmath15 be a mauve triangle of the generation  @xmath13@xmath21@xmath22 .",
    "then , the primary latitude of  @xmath15 intersects five primary latitudes of the generation  @xmath13 , denote them by  @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "there are four triangles of the generation  @xmath13 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 with the following properties : when it exists , @xmath32 contains the vertex of  @xmath15 and it belongs to the latitude  @xmath23 . in this case , the vertex of  @xmath15 is on the isocline which joins the @xmath19 s of  @xmath32 .",
    "let  @xmath12 be the red triangle whose vertex and legs support those of  @xmath15 .",
    "its generation can be written as  @xmath33 + 3 .",
    "it contains two red latitudes of the generation  @xmath33 + 1 , each one containing a triangle  @xmath34 , with @xmath35 , and we may assume that @xmath36  is below  @xmath37 and that the vertex of  @xmath36 belongs to the basis of a red phantom whose vertex belongs to the basis of  @xmath37 .    from @xcite , we know that @xmath12  contains several red triangles of the generation  @xmath33 + 1 which belong to  @xmath25 .",
    "we pick one of them : it is  @xmath37 .",
    "it generates a mauve triangle  @xmath28 which is contained in  @xmath15 , as @xmath37  is also contained in  @xmath15 . note that @xmath29  is generated by a red triangle of the generation  @xmath33 + 1 which is on the second latitude of this kind which are contained in the latitude of  @xmath12",
    "now , the second half of the legs occurs in the latitude of red phantoms of the generation  @xmath33 + 3 . we know that inside red phantoms , the structure of the inner trilaterals is the same as inside a red triangle of the same generation .",
    "this defines  @xmath36 and  @xmath38 which are red triangles of the generation  @xmath33 + 1 .",
    "they are inside  @xmath15 and we have the same relation between  @xmath37 and  @xmath36 as between  @xmath36 and  @xmath38 . and so , we find again two red triangles which give rise to  @xmath30 and  @xmath31 .",
    "the succession from  @xmath28 to  @xmath29 and then from  @xmath29 to  @xmath30 and , finally , from  @xmath30 to  @xmath31 is the same . by the situation of  @xmath39",
    ", we obtain that the legs of  @xmath31 cut the basis of  @xmath15 at their @xmath19 s .",
    "we also see that the basis of  @xmath30 is on the isocline of the vertex of  @xmath31 . as",
    "the distance from the basis of  @xmath38 to the mid - distance line of the phantom  @xmath2 of the generation  @xmath33 + 3 which contains  @xmath36 and  @xmath38 , is the same as the distance from the mid - distance line of  @xmath2 to the vertex of  @xmath39 , and that this distance is half the height of a trilateral of the generation  @xmath33 + 1 , we have that the mid - distance line of  @xmath2 is both on the isocline of the @xmath19 s of  @xmath15 and also on the isocline of the @xmath19 s of  @xmath30 .",
    "this proves the points  @xmath40 and  @xmath41 .",
    "the proof of the other points is also contained in the just given arguments .",
    "now , assume that there is a red triangle  @xmath42 of the generation  @xmath33 + 1 which is in the same connection with  @xmath37 as @xmath37  is with respect to  @xmath36 .",
    "this means that there is a blue triangle  @xmath43 of the generation  @xmath33 + 2 which generates the vertex of  @xmath12 on its mid - distance line and the vertex of  @xmath43 is generated by  @xmath42 .",
    "now , @xmath42  generates a mauve triangle  @xmath32 which contains the vertex of  @xmath15 as there is a red phantom  @xmath44 in the tower of phantoms around the vertex of  @xmath12 , whose vertex is on the basis of  @xmath42 and whose basis generates the vertex of  @xmath37 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath32  contains the vertex of  @xmath15 as  @xmath32 also contains  @xmath44 .",
    "now , note that the vertex of  @xmath15 is on the mid - distance line of the phantom  @xmath44 . as the height of the triangle  @xmath32 is twice that of  @xmath42 , we have",
    "that @xmath15  is on the isocline which supports the mid - distance line of  @xmath44 and , according to the just performed estimation , this isocline joins the @xmath19 s of  @xmath32 .",
    "this proves the last assertion of the lemma .    from the proof",
    ", we can deduce a way to determine the mid - point and the @xmath19 s of a mauve triangle by means of a finitely generated signals .",
    "it will be enough to show that we have just to append a few signals to those which we have already defined .",
    "let @xmath15 be a mauve triangle of the generation  @xmath13 and let  @xmath20 be its height .",
    "its mid - points , which lay at a distance  @xmath45 are easy to determine : it is the corner of the red triangle  @xmath12 on which @xmath15  is constructed .",
    "the determination of the @xmath19 s needs some work .",
    "in fact , the @xmath19 s of  @xmath15 are on the same isocline as the mid - distance line of a phantom whose vertex is generated by the basis of  @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath44  be the leftmost phantom generated by the basis of  @xmath12 . as @xmath44 is a phantom",
    ", its green signal may cut the leg of  @xmath44 .",
    "however , it may not as well , see @xcite , in which case it is continued by an orange signal .",
    "now , the leg of  @xmath15 meets a lot of orange signals coming from all the phantoms which stand close to its borders . without further indication ,",
    "the leg can not distinguish which one comes from  @xmath44 .",
    "the construction proceeds as follows :    first , we look at the determination of the corners of  @xmath15 itself which is not that straightforward .    at the corners of  @xmath12 , the mauve signal defining the leg of  @xmath15 goes on along the extremal branch of the fibonacci tree defining  @xmath12 . at the same time , each corner of  @xmath12 sends a signal towards the other one on the isocline of the basis of  @xmath12 .",
    "call this signal the * brown * signal .",
    "the brown signal has the laterality of the corner . when the brown signal meets the first vertex of the phantom  @xmath44 , it is a red phantom of the generation  @xmath14 + 1 .",
    "the signal goes down along the leg of the phantom which has its laterality .",
    "it goes along this leg until it meets the corner of  @xmath44 . there",
    ", on the isocline  @xmath46 of the basis of  @xmath44 , the brown signal leaves the leg to run on  @xmath46 , to the side of its laterality , until it meets the mauve signal of the leg of  @xmath15 .",
    "then , a mauve signal is sent to the other side , in order to meet the mauve signal sent by the other corner of  @xmath15 .",
    "now , the problem for the signal is to meet the correct leg , as it may encounter a lot of them along  @xmath46 , the isocline of the basis of  @xmath44 , which belong to smaller generations",
    ". the signal may cross them because it meets them at their @xmath19 s where this possibility is foreseen .",
    "when the brown signal first meets a leg whose laterality is opposite to its one , it knows that it is not the appropriate leg .",
    "now , the signal does not cross the leg : otherwise it will meet the opposite leg which is also not the right one : it might also meet several legs of its laterality before meeting a leg with an opposite laterality . as the brown signal can not count arbitrary numbers , it circumvents the triangle by climbing along its leg up to the vertex and then going down to the appropriate isocline . in order to recognize the right isocline ,",
    "when the brown signal starts its circumventing path , it sends another brown signal , say a light one , with no laterality , which goes on running on  @xmath46 , towards the appropriate corner . as @xmath46  is an isocline of the @xmath19  of the triangle which the brown signal circumvents",
    ", the brown signal can not meet another light brown signal meeting the leg : as for red trilaterals , the isocline of a basis is specific to any mauve triangle .",
    "and so , when going down along the leg , the brown signal meets its light brown one , it knows that it has found  @xmath46 on which it goes on its way , still to the side of its laterality . and now , the first mauve leg of its laterality met by the brown signal is the right one .",
    "now , we can use the brown signal in order to locate the  @xmath19 s of  @xmath15 . consider the time when the previous brown signal is going down along the appropriate leg of  @xmath44 .",
    "when the brown signal meets the mid - point of  @xmath44 , it knows that it is the isocline of the @xmath19 s of  @xmath15 .",
    "and so , the brown signal sends a purple signal of the same laterality as the brown signal towards the side of its laterality on the isocline  @xmath47 of the mid - distance line of  @xmath44 .",
    "this signal also circumvents the mauve triangles which it meets .",
    "now , the signal is able to recognize  @xmath47 during the circumvention of phantoms thanks to the following .",
    "we know that the purple signal meets smaller mauve triangles at their @xmath19 s . by induction , we assume that a similar signal arrives to the @xmath19 s from inside the mauve triangle  @xmath16 , created at the time of the construction of  @xmath16 . note that in any case , such a signal is stopped by the leg of  @xmath16 .",
    "now , the arriving signal from the mid - point of the leg of  @xmath44 is deviated to the first part of the leg of  @xmath16 .",
    "when the signal goes down on the other leg , it identifies its  @xmath19 by the arrival of a similar signal of the appropriate laterality which is stopped by the leg .",
    "this allows the signal to again find  @xmath47 and to go on its route on this isocline . due to the laterality of the purple signal and to the fact that its laterality is unchanged and that it must match the mauve leg it meets from inside , such a signal can not be present if it is not sent by a brown signal for detection purpose .",
    "let us look closer at this assertion .",
    "consider a mauve triangle  @xmath48 and , inside it , a mauve triangle  @xmath49 in a place where the isocline of the @xmath19 s of  @xmath49 do not meet those of  @xmath48 .",
    "assume that the generation of  @xmath48 is the successor of the generation of  @xmath49 .",
    "assume too that an inner signal  @xmath50 of  @xmath49 goes out until the leg of  @xmath48 .",
    "if this happens , this may confuse a signal which is circumventing  @xmath48 .",
    "now , as  @xmath50 goes out from the @xmath19 of  @xmath49 , @xmath50  also circumvent  @xmath49 and , together , all the other maximal inner mauve triangles of a generation not greater than that of  @xmath49 whose @xmath19 s are on the same isocline as those of  @xmath49 .",
    "consequently , @xmath50 reaches both legs of  @xmath48 .",
    "now , @xmath50 has a single laterality and when it meets a mauve leg from inside , its laterality must be the same as that of the leg . but here , this not possible , and so @xmath50 can not go out of  @xmath49 .    and",
    "so , this ensures the detection of the @xmath19 s .",
    "note that the detection of the @xmath19 s of inner mauve triangles with the same isocline  @xmath47 does not alter the process due to the fact that the leg stops the signal .",
    "there are tiles with a circumventing signal , with a laterality independent on that of the leg , and tiles without it but , in both cases , the finishing signal inside the triangle is present with the appropriate laterality .",
    "these two kinds of tiles , and no others , force the right choice , again as laterality can not be changed .",
    "now , the mauve signal which defines the basis of a mauve triangle is also emitted by the vertices of the mauve triangle of the same generation but whose primary laterality is just below the considered one .",
    "now , in mauve triangles , a basis must be stopped by its corners .",
    "to handle this situation , we remark that the constraint of laterality of the brown signal allows us to forbid the existence of such a signal in between two contiguous red phantoms of the generation  @xmath13 with their vertices on the basis of  @xmath12 .",
    "now , if a mauve triangle is missing , the left - hand side brown signal goes to the left until it meets the corner of a mauve triangle which exists within the considered latitude .",
    "now , such a meeting from outside of the corner is ruled out : it is enough to forbid such a configuration for the tile defining the corner . and so , if there is no red triangle , the brown signal will be destroyed , as the phantom without brown signal does exist within the same latitude . for the mauve basis",
    ", it is an analogous situation : it may be emitted by the vertex of a mauve triangle and it may be not . if it is emitted and if there is no leg to stop it , the basis meets a corner of a mauve triangle from outside . as the corner stops the mauve basis which is inside the triangle , it is enough to not allow any merging at the level of this tile .",
    "and so , if the mauve legs do not go down , the basis can not exist : it is ruled out by external corners .",
    "now , if the vertex exists , the legs exist and also the corners , due to the brown signal and the corners force the presence of a unilateral mauve basis in between them .",
    "we can now state :    [ tilelp ] the mauve triangles together with the determination of their @xmath19 s and mid - points can be constructed from a finite set of prototiles .",
    "later , inside a triangle or a zone in between two triangles of the same primary latitude , the path which we shall later describe will completely cross the primary latitudes of these domains .",
    "this is why it is important to clearly delimit each zone in each kind of area . for this purpose",
    ", we introduce the notions of @xmath51-cline which we study in the next subsection , together with its construction .",
    "we start from the remark that the basis of a mauve triangle  @xmath15 of the generation  @xmath13 + 1 cuts the legs of the 3-triangles which have their vertex inside  @xmath15 . repeating this remark to the 3-triangle of the generation  @xmath13",
    ", we can construct a sequence @xmath52}$ ] such that :    any mauve triangle  @xmath15 of a positive generation generates such a sequence which we call the * shadow * of  @xmath15 and that @xmath13 + 1 is its generation .",

    "@xmath61-points*.    by definition , the @xmath51-point of a mauve triangle  @xmath15 of the generation  @xmath13 + 1 is the intersection of its leg with the @xmath51-cline of the 2-triangles whose vertex in inside  @xmath15 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the @xmath51-point lies on the leg in between the @xmath19 and the corner .",
    "it is at a distance less than @xmath62 from the line joining the @xmath19 s of  @xmath15 , with @xmath20  being the height of  @xmath15 , and as closer to this value as @xmath13  tends to infinity .      to construct the @xmath51-cline",
    ", we define signals which start from the @xmath19 s of a mauve triangle of the considered generation and latitude .",
    "call them the .",
    "the @xmath51-signals are lateral , with the laterality which is opposite to that of the leg on which they start .",
    "they travel along legs of mauve triangles and along isoclines of a basis .",
    "the @xmath51-signals go down along legs of a laterality opposite to their own one , from an @xmath19 to a corner .",
    "when they run on an isocline , they go in the direction of their laterality . when they meet a corner , they run on the basis , in the direction of the other corner .",
    "they can freely travel on this isocline , until they meet the leg of a triangle of a laterality which is opposite to their own one and at their @xmath19 .",
    "if the leg is of another laterality or if the meeting point is not in the closed interval with the @xmath19 of the leg and its corner as end points , the @xmath51-signals crosses the leg .",
    "it is plain that both @xmath51-signals starting from the opposite @xmath19 s of the same mauve triangle will meet , and they can not do that along a leg or at a corner .",
    "when they meet , they use a join tile , see  @xcite , in which the right - hand , left - hand side @xmath51-signal is on the left- , right - hand side part of the tile .",
    "it is plain that both @xmath51-signals define a kind of convex hull of this part of the mauve triangle .",
    "note that for two consecutive mauve triangles of the same generation within the same isocline , the @xmath51-signal which starts from the low - point of one of them can not travel on this isocline to the facing low - point of the other triangle . indeed , on the right - hand side low - point , we have a left - hand side @xmath51-signal and on the left - hand side low - point with have a right - hand side @xmath51-signal . and so",
    ", this would require a join tile with a left - hand side @xmath51-signal on the left - hand side part of the tile : this is ruled out .",
    "we may impose an additional constraint on the join tile for @xmath51-signals of opposite lateralities with the right - hand side signal on the left - hand side of the join tile : the join tile generates a horizontal unilateral yellow signal .",
    "this signal runs on an isocline only : it marks the @xmath51-cline .",
    "it is important to note here that the whole isocline constitutes the @xmath51-cline .    by construction , the yellow signal travels along an isocline of a basis of a mauve  0 triangle .",
    "consequently , it travels on an isocline  5 .",
    "accordingly , it meets no basis of a mauve triangle of a positive generation and no @xmath19 , as @xmath19 s are always on an isocline  15 . and so , the yellow signal will meet legs of triangles .",
    "1=0    let us closer examine which legs can be met by the yellow signal and how to codify the resulting information on the signal .",
    "consider a yellow signal produced by a mauve triangle  @xmath16 of a positive generation  @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath16  is inside a mauve triangle  @xmath15 of the generation  @xmath13 + 1 , the yellow signal will meet both legs of  @xmath15 from inside . in this case",
    ", we do nothing",
    ".    if @xmath16  is not inside a triangle of the generation  @xmath13 + 1 , it may be in between two such triangles  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 which are consecutive and within the same latitude with , for instance , @xmath29 on the left - hand side of  @xmath16 and  @xmath30 on its right - hand side .",
    "then , the yellow signal will meet the right - hand side leg of  @xmath29 and the left - hand side leg of  @xmath30 .",
    "if it meets the part of one leg covered by the @xmath51-signal , the meeting of the other leg also happens on a part covered by the @xmath51-signal .",
    "then , this meeting rises a black signal which accompanies the yellow one .",
    "if the yellow signal meets the leg of  @xmath29 on another part of the leg , we do nothing .",
    "the last situation , is when @xmath16  is outside a triangle of the generation  @xmath13 + 1 and within its latitude and also inside a triangle of a generation  @xmath13+@xmath63 + 2 , with @xmath64 .",
    "then we decide that the decision relatively to a possible black signal is given by the triangle of the generation  @xmath13 + 1 .",
    "if the black signal is present , it is stopped by the leg of the triangle of the generation  @xmath13+@xmath63 + 2 .",
    "accordingly , a wrongly placed tile can be removed without ambiguity and it can be replaced by the appropriate tile with , or without the black signal as , when the yellow signal reaches a leg from outside , the leg requires the black signal or forbids it .",
    "now , on the other side of the yellow signal , either the same situation occurs , or we have the neutral situation of a leg reached from inside which allows both situations . in this latter case ,",
    "the situation of the leg reached from outside determines the signal .    in our study of the shadow of a mauve triangle",
    ", we have already noticed that the same @xmath51-cline can be shared by several triangles of different generations .    for the purpose of the path , in the case of a @xmath51-cline of type  2",
    ", we consider that it defines a special signal on the isocline which is just below the @xmath51-cline .",
    "this means that there is a * pre - path signal * on the isocline  4 which is just below a @xmath51-cline of type  2 .",
    "this signal plays an important role as can be seen further .",
    "note that the pre - path signals of a given generation are different from those of the next generation : the signals corresponding to the generation  @xmath13 + 1 occur on the isocline  4 of a @xmath51-cline of type  3 in terms of the generation  @xmath13 .",
    "we have a stronger result :    [ isoprepath ] the isoclines of a pre - path signal of the generation  @xmath13 are different from those of the generation  @xmath65 for any @xmath13 , @xmath65 with @xmath66 .    proof .",

    "the pre - path signals of the next generation correspond to @xmath51-clines of type  0 of the generation  @xmath65 .",

    "but , the @xmath51-clines of type  3 of a generation also belong to the @xmath51-clines of type  3 too of the previous generation .",
    "this is due to the fact that the number of @xmath51-clines which are crossed is a multiple of  4 . by induction , this proves our claim .      for the next section ,",
    "we need to make clear the connection between a mauve triangle  @xmath15 of the generation  @xmath13 + 1 and its inner mauve triangles of the generation  @xmath13 .    to locate the triangles of the just previous generation",

    "we already noticed that the intersection between mauve triangles occur between a leg and a basis and that with respect to the leg , the intersection happens at its low point .",
    "the consequence is that mauve triangles of the generation  @xmath13 which are inside  @xmath15 are cut by the basis of  @xmath15 if and only if they are 3-triangles .",
    "now , the converse is true :    [ cutis23 ] let @xmath15 be a mauve triangle of the generation  @xmath13@xmath21@xmath22 . its basis cuts mauve triangles of the generations  @xmath57 for any  @xmath57 in  @xmath58 $ ] .",

    "it is not difficult to see , by definition of the @xmath19 s of  @xmath29 , that the line of the @xmath19 s of  @xmath29 cuts inner mauve triangles of the generation  @xmath13@xmath721 if and only if they are of type  2 .",
    "now , this can be repeated for these 2-triangles .",
    "now , as mauve triangles which are within the same latitude have the same type , we conclude that any mauve triangle of the generation  @xmath57 , with @xmath69 , is of type  2 .",
    "now , consider the @xmath51-cline of type 2 which corresponds to the mauve triangles of the generation  @xmath13 which are inside  @xmath15 .",
    "this @xmath73-cline gives rise to a pre - path which plays an important role in the construction of a path which fills  @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , it is important to recognize the intersection of this @xmath51-cline with the legs of  @xmath15 .",
    "we call them the * @xmath51-points * of  @xmath15",
    ".    lemma  [ cutis23 ] gives us a way to construct the @xmath51-points of a mauve triangle .",
    "note that there is no @xmath51-point on a mauve-0 triangle and that the @xmath51-point of a mauve triangle  @xmath29 of generation  1 is easy to determine .",
    "indeed , the line joining the @xmath19 of  @xmath29 cuts inner mauve-0 triangles of type  2 .",
    "now , the basis of theses triangles are on the same isocline which is the @xmath51-cline passing through the @xmath51-point of  @xmath29 . and",
    "so the construction is simple : the construction of the @xmath51-point in the general case relies on lemma  [ cutis23 ] .",
    "now , this time , we can not start from the  @xmath19 of  @xmath15 : it meets only triangles of type  2 of all generations from  0 to  @xmath13 and so , it is difficult to recognize those of generation  @xmath13 by a fixed in advance amount of means .",
    "now , if we start the silver signal from the corner , it can be performed according to the following algorithm :    note that this construction also holds when @xmath71 .",
    "let us prove that algorithm  [ betapoint ] is correct .    from lemma  [ cutis23 ] ,",
    "when the first direction of the silver signal meets a 3-triangle , it is a triangle  @xmath31 of the generation  @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , the signal meets the leftmost 3-triangle of the generation  @xmath13 whose vertex is inside  @xmath15 .",
    "when the signal arrives on the isocline of the vertex of  @xmath31 , it is the isocline of the bases of the 2-triangles of the generation  @xmath13 which are inside  @xmath15 .",
    "going away from the initial leg of  @xmath15 , the signal arrives to the 2-triangle of the generation  @xmath13 which is the closest to the leg , @xmath30 .",
    "the signal meets @xmath30 at its corner which faces the leg of  @xmath15 . at this corner , according to what we have seen , the silver signal meets the @xmath51-signal .",
    "as it then follows the @xmath51-signal down to the @xmath51-cline of  @xmath30 , and then the @xmath51-cline itself in the direction of the leg of  @xmath15 from where it comes , it eventually meets the leg of  @xmath15 .",
    "now , the silver signal meets legs of both lateralities which can not always been distinguished even with the help of the circumventing technique .",
    "and so , the first direction of the silver signal goes on along the @xmath51-cline , constantly .",
    "now , during the same time , the second direction of the signal goes up along the same leg of  @xmath15 from the corner to the direction of the  @xmath19 . before reaching the  @xmath19",
    ", it meets the @xmath51-cline which is accompanied by the other silver signal .",
    "this allows to fix the @xmath51-point and both directions of the silver signal to meet and to stop each other .",
    "note that these silver signals of different mauve triangles can meet : this happens when the first direction of the silver signal coming from  @xmath15 reaches the corner of the 2-triangle of the generation  @xmath13 . in this case , as the signal concerns the current generation and its previous one only , there can not be more than the occurrence of two signals belonging to different generations . in this case , the basis contains two silver signals : that which it generates and that which it receives from the next generation .",
    "it can be realized in the tiles by giving different horizontal channels to these signals : an upper channel for the silver signal of the same generation , as it will go up ; a lower channel for the silver signal coming from the next generation as it will go down . in this way , the signals of different triangles do not intersect .",
    "consequently , as the intersection of both directions of a silver signal of the same generation stop each other :    [ uniquebeta ] in any mauve triangle of a positive generation , there is a single @xmath51-point on each leg .",
    "1=0    for a reason which will appear in the next sections , especially about the path filling up the plane , we need to define another point on the leg of a mauve triangle of positive generation : the * @xmath61-point*. by definition , the @xmath61-point on the leg of a mauve triangle  @xmath15 of the generation  @xmath13 + 1 is the intersection of the @xmath51-cline defined by the hat of  @xmath15 with the considered leg of  @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath61-point lies in between the vertex of  @xmath15 and the @xmath74 of  @xmath15 .",
    "the distance of the @xmath61-point from the vertex is the same as the distance from the @xmath19 and the @xmath51-point .",
    "the reason is that both are determined by @xmath51-clines associated to triangles of the generation  @xmath13 .",
    "now , the construction of the @xmath61-point is also rather easy .    a signal ,",
    "call it the * @xmath61-signal * , starts from the @xmath74 of  @xmath15 and goes up towards the vertex of  @xmath15 .",
    "the first basis of mauve triangle which is met by the signal is the basis of the hat of  @xmath15 , say @xmath32 .",
    "the signal goes along this basis in the direction of the corner of  @xmath32 which is the closest to the @xmath74 .",
    "when the corner is reached , the @xmath61-signal finds there the @xmath51-signal of the hat and it goes back , following this  @xmath51-signal until it find the @xmath51-cline of the hat , say  @xmath46 .",
    "it is the expected one .",
    "the @xmath61-signal follows  @xmath46 until it meets again the leg of  @xmath15 : the single one which contains the @xmath61-signal issued from the @xmath74 of this side of the triangle .",
    "note that this signal can not be confused with other signals belonging to other legs .",
    "indeed , other legs can be present but they are in a part which goes from their vertex to an intersection which is the mid - point of the interval going from the vertex to the high - point , or in a part which is below their mid - point . in both cases ,",
    "there is no @xmath61-signal in this parts of legs sot that the single leg accompanied by a @xmath61-signal which can be crossed by  @xmath46 is that of  @xmath15 .    from this",
    "we conclude that the @xmath61-point also can be defined by a finite set of prototiles .    about the construction of the @xmath51-points",
    ", it can be noticed that algorithm  [ betapoint ] can be processed in the reverse order .",
    "this means that it can be constructed from a mauve triangle  @xmath15 of type  2 and of the generation  @xmath13 for looking at the @xmath51-point of the mauve triangle  @xmath16 of the generation  @xmath13 + 1 which contains  @xmath15 if any .",
    "the algorithm may detect if  @xmath16 exists or not and , when it exits , how to find the @xmath51-point .",
    "the existence of  @xmath16 is equivalent to the presence of a basis at the @xmath19 s of the mauve triangle of type  3 of the generation  @xmath13 reached by the pre - signal emitted from  @xmath15 looking after such a basis .",
    "if the basis is reached , the pre - signal returns to  @xmath15 in order to trigger the signals of algorithm  [ betapoint ] in a reverse order which allows to detect the @xmath51-point . accordingly",
    ", this provides an iterative and bottom - up version of algorithm  [ betapoint ] for the construction of the @xmath51-points . a last feature about",
    "the @xmath51-point is that it allows to differentiate the part of the @xmath51-cline of type  2 on which it lies which is contained in the triangle from the part which is outside .    later , we shall see that this differentiation is very important .",
    "it can easily be realized , for instance as follows , according to the differentiation between open and covered basis in the interwoven triangles .",
    "each @xmath51-point emits a horizontal signal on its isocline , outside the triangle to which it belongs .",
    "the signal is lateral and has the laterality of the leg . in between two consecutive mauve triangles on the same primary latitude and of the same generation , the signals emitted by the opposite @xmath51-points",
    "meet thanks to a join - tile which is similar to those used with the interwoven triangles . on the part where the horizontal signal is present",
    ", we shall say that the @xmath51-cline is * covered*. in the part where it is not present , we shall say that the @xmath51-cline is * open*. clearly , the @xmath51-cline is open inside the mauve triangles of its generation and it is covered in - between two consecutive such triangles within the same latitude .",
    "1=0    we have seen that the primary latitude of a mauve triangle is the set of isoclines which cross its legs , the isocline of the vertex being excluded but that of the basis begin included .",
    "the problem with this definition is that a triangle  3 @xmath29  of the generation  @xmath13 attached to a triangle  @xmath28 of the generation  @xmath13 + 1 is not contained in  @xmath28 .",
    "however , what is not inside  @xmath28 is the the fourth part of  @xmath29 : in fact , the basis of  @xmath28 crosses  @xmath29 along the isocline of its mid - points . in some sense",
    ", we would like to consider  @xmath29 as contained in the space defined by  @xmath28 . to be coherent",
    ", this requires to rule out the hat of  @xmath28 .    in this way , this compels us to include in this space a part which belongs to another primary isocline of the same generation .",
    "this is why we define the notion of * latitude * as a more complex notion as that of a primary latitude .",
    "this is also motivated by the way for the path which is constructed in the next section .",
    "let us go back to the previous mauve triangles  @xmath28 and  @xmath29 , where @xmath29 is not completely contained in  @xmath28 .",
    "now , if we look at  @xmath29 and if  @xmath75 , we can repeat with  @xmath29 the considerations which we did with  @xmath28 .",
    "there is a triangle  @xmath30 of the generation  @xmath13@xmath721 which has its vertex inside  @xmath29 but which is not completely contained in  @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , the basis of  @xmath29 cuts the legs of  @xmath30 at their low point .",
    "we can repeat this process until we arrive to a mauve triangle of the generation  @xmath76 .",
    "we define the latitude by the notion of * border line*.    for a given primary latitude of the generation  @xmath13 , the * border line * is a broken line which , in between two consecutive mauve triangles of the generation  @xmath13 and within the latitude runs along the isocline of the low points of these triangles .",
    "when the border line meets a triangle  @xmath28 , it first goes down along the leg of  @xmath28 until it meets the corner .",
    "there , it goes on on the basis of  @xmath28 , until it meets the leg of a new triangle  @xmath29 , necessarily of the previous generation .",
    "as the basis of  @xmath28 is on the isocline of the low points of the legs of  @xmath29 , we can repeat the process . when a triangle of the generation  @xmath76 is met , the process stops and the border line goes up .",
    "but it goes horizontally as soon as a basis of a triangle is met and it can go down again when a triangle of a smaller generation is met .",
    "after several ups and downs , the border goes back to the other lower point of  @xmath28 and , from there , it goes on on the isocline of the low points of  @xmath28 until it meets the next triangle of the generation  @xmath13 , @xmath77 .",
    "of course , before meeting  @xmath77 , the border line may meet other triangles of smaller generations . as it will be at their low points ,",
    "the same process as mentioned above also applies .",

    "we generalize these notions to all mauve triangles of a given generation compared with the next one .",
    "we shall say that a triangle  @xmath48 of the generation  @xmath13 is an @xmath57-triangle in a triangle  @xmath49 of the generation  @xmath13 + 1 , with @xmath79 if the latitude of  @xmath48 is in the same position with respect to  @xmath49 as the latitude of  @xmath78 with respect to  @xmath15 .",

    "we know that the bases and vertices of mauve triangles characterize the corresponding triangles .",

    "it is the reason why the same ambiguity is attached to the isoclines of the @xmath19 s as we can see from lemma  [ innerandlp ] .",
    "recursively applying the lemma to inner triangles in a fixed mauve triangle , we obtain that @xmath19 s of a triangle of the generation  @xmath13 may be crossed by the basis of a triangle of the generation  @xmath13+@xmath63 , for any positive  @xmath63 . in general , it is not possible to predict if such a situation will occur .",

    ". these triangles may be intersected by smaller triangles only , which cut their basis or their legs near their vertices .",
    "going back to 2-triangles , we can see that if a 2-triangle  @xmath15 is of a generation  @xmath13 with  @xmath75 , we can find smaller triangles which are also 2-triangles inside  @xmath15 , their legs being cut by the basis of  @xmath15 , at their @xmath19 s too . and this can be repeated until we reach the generation  0 .",
    "we can say the same for  3-triangles .",

    "the difficulty comes from the fact that the hat may not exist while the @xmath61-point can always defined for a mauve triangle of a positive generation .    as for the @xmath51-point",
    ", the @xmath61-point is not defined for a mauve-0 triangle . for a mauve triangle  @xmath29 of generation  1 , consider the above definition when the hat exists .",
    "we remark that the @xmath51-cline is defined by the basis of the hat as it is a mauve-0 triangle .",
    "now , the basis of the hat contains vertices of the 0-triangles of generation  0 contained in  @xmath29 .",
    "now , as @xmath29 exists , its inner 0-triangles also exist . and so , it is possible to define the @xmath61-points of  @xmath29 by using its 0-triangles only .",
    "first , we call * first points * , @xmath95 for short , the point of a leg of a mauve triangle  @xmath15 which is at a distance  @xmath18 from the vertex of  @xmath15 .",
    "the construction of the @xmath61-points starts by the determination of the @xmath95 s which is easy : it is not difficult to see that the @xmath95 s of  @xmath15 are the mid - points of the red triangle  @xmath12 whose vertex is the same as that of  @xmath15 .",
    "then , we proceed as follows :    the justification of this algorithm relies on the fact that the isocline  @xmath46 which joins the @xmath95 s of  @xmath29 passes through the @xmath19 s of the 0-triangles which are contained in  @xmath29 . from this fact which is easy to establish , and from the intersection properties of the mauve triangles ,",
    "we conclude that all other mauve triangles which are encountered by the isocline  @xmath46 are 2-triangles , and that @xmath46 passes by the @xmath19 s of these triangles too .",
    "the general case is not much more difficult to establish by the following recursive algorithm .",
    "the justification of the construction given by algorithm  [ gamma ] is provided by the following lemma .",
    "[ fpline ] let @xmath15  be a mauve triangle of the generation  @xmath13@xmath21@xmath22 .",
    "the isocline which passes through its @xmath95 s encounters mauve triangles inside  @xmath15 of types  @xmath76 and  @xmath70 only .",
    "the meeting occurs at the @xmath19 s of the inner triangles .",
    "the encountered @xmath76-triangles belong to the generation  @xmath13 .",
    "the encountered @xmath70-triangles belong to a generation  @xmath57 with @xmath69 .",
    "the conclusion on the generations of the inner 0- and 2-triangles encountered by the isocline  @xmath46 which passes through the @xmath95 s of  @xmath15 is a consequence of the fact that the meeting with the legs of the triangles occur at their @xmath19 s , as we have seen in lemma  [ innerandlp ] .",
    "now , the fact that @xmath46  meets the inner triangles at their @xmath19 s is easy .",
    "the 3-triangles of the generation  @xmath13 inside  @xmath15 are cut by the basis of  @xmath15 at their  @xmath19 s .",
    "now , the distance in isoclines from the basis of  @xmath15 to its  @xmath95 s is @xmath96 where @xmath20  is the height of  @xmath15 .",
    "now , the height of a triangle of the generation  @xmath13 is  @xmath18 .",
    "accordingly , for what is the disposition of the isoclines , @xmath46  is in the same position with respect to a 0-triangle of the generation  @xmath13 as the basis with respect to a 3-triangle of the generation  @xmath13 .",
    "consequently , inside the 0-triangle of the generation  @xmath13 , the isocline meets inner triangles at their @xmath19 s and they are all of the type  2 as already seen . by synchronization ,",
    "it is the same for the inner triangles , encountered by this isocline .",
    "we have an additional interesting property :    [ gammaaligned ] the isocline of the @xmath61-points of a mauve triangle meets other mauve triangles at their @xmath61-points too .    proof .",
    "this comes from the structure of the tower which defines a @xmath51-cline . and , by construction",
    ", the isoclines through the @xmath61-points is a @xmath51-cline .",
    "we can formulate the same remark about algorithm  [ gamma ] as the one which was formulated for algorithm  [ betapoint ] .",
    "the construction can also performed in the reverse order .",
    "again we have a pre - signal which detects the existence of a containing mauve triangle of the next generation .",
    "it is the same signal as previously , looking after a basis at the @xmath19 of a mauve triangle of type  3 reached from the considered mauve triangle of type  0 .",
    "if the basis is found , the pre - signal goes back to its emitting point in order to trigger the signals of algorithm  [ gamma ] in the reverse order .",
    "again , this provides us with an iterative and bottom - up version of algorithm  [ gamma ] .      from the notion of @xmath61-points , it is easy to define the @xmath74 s .",
    "indeed , the @xmath74 s of a mauve triangle  @xmath15 is defined by the following construction .",
    "a signal starts from each @xmath95 of  @xmath15 and goes up along the leg , towards the vertex of  @xmath15 . if there is a @xmath61-point , then if the @xmath51-cline which passes through the @xmath61-point is a @xmath51-cline of type  2 , the @xmath74 is the @xmath61-point and the signal stops there",
    "otherwise , the signal goes on climbing along the vertex until it meets the first basis which cuts the legs of  @xmath15 if any .",
    "if such a basis is encountered , the meeting with the legs of  @xmath15 define the @xmath74 s .",
    "if not , the @xmath74 is the tile of the leg which is on the isocline which is just below the vertex .",
    "this is also the definition of the @xmath74 for a mauve-0 triangle .",
    "now , we turn to the construction of the path .",
    "the general strategy which we follow was presented in  @xcite , but we shall make it much more precise .",
    "the path goes from an  @xmath19 to a  @xmath74 and then to an  @xmath19 and so on .",
    "it can be seen as a bi - infinite word of the form @xmath97 on the alphabet @xmath98 .",
    "roughly speaking , we fill up a latitude until we meet legs which cross both the upper and the lower border of the latitude . then , we go up or down , depending on the direction of the path and into which type of basic region we fall : the type of a bigger triangle or of a zone in between two bigger triangles .    in most cases , this strategy is enough to fill up the whole plane .",
    "later , we shall discuss about the exceptional cases .",
    "our first task is to define the regions which we shall investigate and then , how the path is built on the basis of what will be called the * basic regions*.    we have two basic regions .",
    "the first one is the set of tiles defined by a mauve triangle : its borders and its inside .",
    "remember that the basis of a mauve triangle contains more than the majority of tiles resulting from the just given definition .",
    "it is considered as a basic region as once the path enters a mauve triangle  @xmath15 , it fills up  @xmath15 almost completely before leaving  @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , there is a restriction and the path fills a bigger area .",
    "in fact , the path also fills up the space which is contained between the basis of  @xmath15 and the part of the border of the latitude of  @xmath15 which is delimited by the corners of  @xmath15 , the tiles on this border being included .",
    "the restriction comes from the definition of the latitude : we have to withdraw at least the tiles belonging to the border of the just upper latitude of the same generation .",
    "an additional restriction comes in the case when the @xmath74 is on an open @xmath51-cline of type  2 , as we shall describe this later .",
    "the other type of a basic region is defined by the area in between two consecutive mauve triangles of the same generation within the same latitude .",
    "we already know that the just indicated regions can be split into four horizontal slices defined by the types of the triangles of the just previous generation which are contained in these regions . now",
    ", if we go from one side to another in each slice , and if the directions alternate from one slice to the next one , this even number raises a problem : a priori , starting from one side , we go back to the same side . to solve this problem , we split one slice into two ones thanks to the @xmath51-cline of type  2 : inside a mauve triangle",
    ", there is a unique open @xmath51-cline of type  2 which runs from one leg of the triangle to the other .",
    "it is the isocline of the @xmath51-points .",
    "this @xmath51-cline splits the region of type  3 into to sub - slices .",
    "we shall use the second one to go back to the original side . as there remain three slices , we go from the original one to the opposite one , as required .",
    "this is the general principle for defining the path .",
    "note that this principle holds both for triangles an the in between region .",
    "we shall now turn to the precise description .",
    "we shall examine how we fill up the basic regions for generation  0 and we shall then proceed by induction from  @xmath13 to  @xmath13 + 1 .",
    "in fact , as we shall see , the induction step can be based on what is to do for the basic regions of generation  1 .",
    "@xmath99 the situation of generation  0 is the simplest one .    for a triangle ,",
    "the trajectory of the path is the following .",
    "the path enters the triangle through one of its @xmath19 s , say  @xmath0 .",
    "then , it runs along the leg of the triangle , downwards , until it reaches the corner . on this way , the path is in the inside part of the tile which supports the leg . at the corner ,",
    "the path follows the basis , until it reaches the other corner .",
    "there , it goes up along the leg to the next isocline and there , it goes along the isocline to the leg of  @xmath0 .",
    "just before reaching the leg , the path goes up to the next isocline and there , it runs along it until it reaches the leg , opposite to  @xmath0 .",
    "this back and forth motion , climbing up by one isocline each time a leg is reached goes on until the path reaches the top of the triangle . there , the path exits from the triangle through the isocline  @xmath721 below the vertex or the isocline  @xmath722 , depending on the type of the triangle : if the triangle is of type  3 , the path exists through the isocline  @xmath722 , if not , it exits through the isocline  @xmath721 .",
    "the exit  @xmath43 is placed on this isocline , on the leg of the triangle which is opposite to the leg on which @xmath0  lies .",
    "figure  [ mauve_0 ] illustrates this part of the path for a triangle when the topmost isocline is not occupied by another segment of the path .",
    "-20pt 110= for a part between two consecutive mauve-0 triangles within the same latitude , we have the three situations which result from lemma  [ samevertices ] .",
    "the easiest situation is when two consecutive mauve-0 triangles have their vertices on the basis of the same mauve-0 triangle . in this case",
    ", we have a similar zig - zag line as in a triangle .",
    "figure  [ trapeze_0 ] illustrates this situation which looks like very much to what happens in a mauve-0 triangle .",
    "-10pt 110= -10pt 110=    in order to describe what happens in the other situations , we define a schematic representation of the zig - zag path of figure  [ mauve_0 ] and  [ trapeze_0 ] in figure  [ schemas ] .",
    "now , as these situation will be involved starting from generations with a positive number , we postpone the representation of the other case of basic regions of generation  0 to the situation concerning generation  1 .",
    "it is important to indicate that the representations of figure  [ mauve_0 ] and  [ trapeze_0 ] are also schematic .",
    "in fact , the actual trajectory of the path is a bit more complex .",
    "we can not decide that on a leg of a mauve triangle of any generation the path strictly goes on the tiles crossed by the mauve signal and only them .",
    "if we do this , we can not have a path which goes through any tile according to the indicated scenario .",
    "however , it is possible to slightly change the trajectory of the path in order to make things possible .",
    "if the path has to go along the leg , there is no problem to organize the hairpin - turns of the zig - zags when the path is on the left - hand side of the leg .",
    "indeed , the leg is along a line of black nodes .",
    "there is a parallel line of white nodes which are the left - hand side neighbours of the black nodes .",
    "when the path is on the left - hand side , the organization of the hairpin - turns requires some care , otherwise , the condition to go through all tiles once would not be respected .",
    "the path on the leg follows the following pattern .",
    "let @xmath100 denote the black nodes of the leg , @xmath63 indicating an absolute number for the isocline on which the node is .",

    "a solution is the following path : go from @xmath100 to @xmath103 , then to  @xmath104 and then to  @xmath105 and from there , repeat the just described pattern .",
    "the pattern of hairpin - turns for an inside path is defined as follows , using the same notations .",

    "we shall later see the mechanism which forces one @xmath19 to be open and the other to be closed . and",
    "so , going down , still zig - zagging , the path will meet the @xmath19 of the closest 1-triangle of generation  0 to  @xmath30 . here",

    "which type of point is met , the path knows that the @xmath51-cline must be followed in order to cross the leg of a triangle .",
    "@xmath111 figures  [ mauve_1 ] and  [ mauve_1 in ] allow us to prove the induction step which allow to establish the path in a basic region of the generation  @xmath13 + 1 once the path is established in any basic region of the generation  @xmath13",
    ".    to see this point , it is enough to start from one of the figures  [ mauve_1 ] or  [ mauve_1 in ] .",
    "now , we consider that the big triangles belong to the generation  @xmath13 + 1 and that the small ones belong to the generation  @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , we assume that for the generation  @xmath13 , the path goes from an  @xmath19 to the opposite  @xmath74 inside a triangle and from a  @xmath74 to the opposite  @xmath19 in the region in - between two consecutive triangles of the generation  @xmath13 within the same latitude .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the same scheme of the indicated figures allow to define the path for the basic regions of the generation  @xmath13 + 1 .",
    "however , a tuning is needed here , as the @xmath51-clines are no more in contact of the bases for the mauve triangles of the generation  @xmath13 + 1 . to see this point , consider that we also draw the mauve triangles of the generation  @xmath13@xmath721 , now assuming that  @xmath112 .",
    "then , it is not difficult to see that the regions of the generation  @xmath13 split into regions of the generation  @xmath13@xmath72@xmath22 in the same way as those of the generation  @xmath13 + 1 split into regions of the generation  @xmath13 .",
    "we have the following general property :    [ cover ] let  @xmath113 be a tile of the tiling .",

    "and then : either @xmath113 falls within a mauve triangle of generation  @xmath13 in this latitude or @xmath113 falls outside two consecutive mauve triangles of generation  @xmath13 and of the latitude  @xmath114 and in between them .",
    "this property follows immediately from the fact that the latitude of a mauve triangle exactly covers that of the corresponding red triangle and the following latitude of red phantoms .      in order to ensure the guidance of the path",
    ", we provide an additional tool .    as indicated in the previous section , if one @xmath19 allows the path to enter a triangle , the other forbids such a possibility .",
    "we have the same property for a @xmath74 .",
    "in fact , it is not difficult to devise signals based on the notion of laterality which allow to ensure this working",
    ". it may be one or the other @xmath19 , mandatory one of them and never both of them .",
    "this is performed by a signal which runs along the legs and which meet at the vertex .",
    "each @xmath19 sends a signal to the other which runs along the leg to the vertex where they meet .",
    "if the @xmath19 admits the path , it sends a signal of its laterality and if not , it sends a signal of the other laterality . and so , it is enough to forbid the meeting of signals of opposite lateralities . in this way",
    ", only unilateral signals are allowed and they indicate the general motion of the path . note that once the laterality is fixed , this allows to place signboards at appropriate places .",
    "first , the knowledge of which @xmath19 is admitting allows to know which @xmath74 allows the path to exit from the triangle .",
    "this is inside a triangle .",
    "now , the same mechanism can be used to direct the path in between two consecutive triangles .",
    "this time , the information , still going from an  @xmath19 to another goes through the corners and takes the route of the red basis of a phantom which runs on the considered isocline . on this isocline",
    "there can be corners of the appropriate generation only .",
    "now , inside a basic region and within a sub - latitude , the direction of the path is the same .",
    "in fact it is the same all along the latitude , as can be easily noticed from the fact that there is a shift in the triangles with respect with the in between regions .",
    "accordingly , the same direction occurs globally .",
    "the change of direction happens when the path meets the legs of a triangle .",
    "this occurs for the standard hairpins of the zig - zags .",
    "now , the signal which goes from one @xmath19 to the other also allows to place signboards at the decisive positions : the mid - point and the @xmath95 s , when the path climbs along the leg to go from a sub - latitude to the next one .",
    "now , the signal which goes in between two consecutive triangles has also to detect the possibility of a leg coming from a bigger generation : this event may change the direction of the further motion of the path . for this purpose ,",
    "the signal circumvents the mauve triangles it meets on its way .",
    "the isocline of a corner continues a basis : accordingly it meets smaller mauve triangles at their @xmath19 s , the mauve triangles of their generation at corners again and bigger triangles at various places , except the @xmath19 s .",
    "accordingly , when such a meeting occurs , the signal knows that it stops here . a last tuning deals with the parity of the number of zig - zags in a basic region .",
    "it is not difficult to notice that the path should arrive at particular isoclines in the right direction . as already seen , the various signboards which we have constructed allow to do this without problem .",
    "as an example , the corners of mauve triangles play an important role but there is not need to signalize them : they are recognizable by their very conformation which is unique .",
    "now , in order that the zig - zag line leads a point on a leg to the opposite leg , we need an odd number of zig - zags . the height of a triangle , in terms of isoclines , the basis being included but the vertex being excluded , is an even number .",
    "but , it is not difficult to organize one piece of a zig - zag in a given direction on two isoclines .",
    "it is enough to go up to a node of the highest isocline from its leftmost son , then to go down to the next son from the son and then to go on until the leftmost son of the next node .",
    "the need of such a run can be signalized , as the parity of the number of isoclines can easily be computed .",
    "it is enough to put signboards of the required points three isoclines sooner in order the path know whether it goes on along a standard motion or it has to simultaneously cross two isoclines on the same motion .",
    "we can derive two corollaries from lemma  [ cover ] .",
    "the first one is very important :    [ nocycle ] the path contains no cycle .",
    "i there was a cycle , it would be contained in some basic region .",
    "now , the path enters the region through an @xmath19 in case of a triangle , through an @xmath74 in case of an in between region and it exits through the opposite  @xmath74 or @xmath19 respectively .",
    "accordingly , there is no cycle in this region due to the recursive structure of the basic regions and it is plain that there is no cycle in a basic region of generation  0 .",
    "another one is also very important :    [ anysize ] for any tile  @xmath113 , the path on one side of  @xmath113 fills up infinitely many mauve triangles of increasing sizes .",
    "this also comes from the filling up of the basic regions and their recursive structure .",
    "the path can not remain in the same latitude for ever .",
    "and so , it goes to another latitude , upper or lower , depending on the structure of the underlying model implemented by the interwoven triangles .",
    "this ensures the conclusion of the corollary .",
    "another consequence is given by the following statement :    [ onecomponent ] if there are only finite basic regions , the path goes through any tile of the plane .    proof . in this case",
    ", we have a sequence of increasing and embedded basic regions as easily follows from the proof of corollaries  [ nocycle ] and  [ anysize ] .",
    "corollary  [ onecomponent ] indicates that if there are only finite triangles , then we have a plane - filling path .",
    "is it possible to have infinite triangles ?",
    "the answer is yes : this means that there are also infinite red triangles .",
    "we know that this happens with the butterfly model .",
    "no interwoven triangle crosses a given isocline  15 . as a corollary",
    ", there is an infinite mauve basis which crosses infinitely many 2-triangles of any sizes .",
    "now , this basis gives rise to infinitely many mauve triangles , by the very principle of synchronization .",
    "and so , this situation is possible .",
    "now , it is the unique one : an infinite triangle has an infinite basis and this assumption leads to what we have just described .    in this case",
    ", there can not be a single path passing through all tiles of the plane once only .    indeed",
    ", once the path enters an infinite triangle , it can not leave it . the same for a region in between two infinite triangles with the vertex on the infinite basis . and",
    "so , in this case , there are infinitely many components for the path . however , corollary  [ anysize ] is still valid for them .",
    "we can now prove :    [ undecinjfreeze ] the injectivity of the global function of a cellular automaton on the ternary heptagrid from its local transition function is undecidable .",
    "the proof follows the argument of  @xcite , with a slight modification .",
    "in particular , we have to bring a new ingredient to the path as described in section  3 : we define a direction for the path .",
    "this can be introduced by three hues in the colour used for the signal of the path .",
    "one colour calls the next one and the last one calls the first one . the periodic repetition of this pattern together with the order of the colours define the direction .",
    "this notion of direction allows to define the successor of a tile on the path .",
    "this can be formalized by a function @xmath116 from @xmath117 to the tiling such that @xmath118+@xmath119 is the successor of @xmath120 on the path .",
    "remember that in  @xcite , the automaton  @xmath121 attached to a set of tiles  @xmath15 has its states in @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the set of tiles which defines the tiling with the plane filling property and  @xmath15 is an arbitrary finite set of tiles .",
    "we can still tile the plane as we assume that the tiles of  @xmath15 are ternary heptagons but the abutting conditions may be not observed : if it is observed with all the neighbours of the cell  @xmath124 , the corresponding configuration is said to be * correct * at  @xmath124 , otherwise it is said * incorrect*. when the considered configuration is correct at every tile for  @xmath123 or at every tile for  @xmath15 , it is called a * realization * of the corresponding tiling .",
    "let  @xmath116 denote the function defining the orientation of the path induced by a realization of  @xmath123 .    here ,",
    "we introduce a difference with  @xcite . instead of considering any finite set of tiles",
    ", we consider the family @xmath125 of finite sets of prototiles defined in  @xcite where @xmath16 runs over the set of deterministic turing machines with a single head and a single bi - infinite tape starting their computation from the empty tape . as in  @xcite ,",
    "the transition function does not change neither the @xmath123- nor the of the state of a cell  @xmath124 : it only changes its @xmath126-component  @xmath127 which is later on called the * bit * of  @xmath124 . as in  @xcite , we define @xmath128 if the configuration in  @xmath123 or in  @xmath15 is incorrect at the considered tile .",
    "if both are correct , we define @xmath129 .",
    "it is plain that if @xmath16 does not halt , @xmath130 tiles the hyperbolic plane and there is a configuration of  @xmath123 and one of  @xmath130 which are realizations of the respective tilings .",
    "then , the transition function computes the xor of the bit of a cell and its successor on the path .",
    "hence , defining all cells with  0 and then all cells with  1 define two configurations which  @xmath131 transform to the same   is not injective .",
    "conversely , if @xmath131  is not injective , we have two different configurations  @xmath132 and  @xmath133 for which the image is the same .",
    "hence , there is a cell  @xmath134 at which the configurations differ .",
    "hence , the xor was applied , which means that  @xmath123 and  @xmath15 are both correct at this cell in these configurations and it is not difficult to see that the value for each configuration at the successor of  @xmath134 on the path must also be different . and",
    "so , following the path in one direction , we have a correct tiling for both  @xmath123 and  @xmath130 .",
    "now , from corollary  [ anysize ] , as the path fills up infinitely many triangles of increasing sizes , this means that the tiling realized for @xmath130 is correct in these triangles .",
    "in particular , the turing machine  @xmath16 never halts .",
    "and so , we proved that @xmath131 is not injective if and only if @xmath16 does not halt .",
    "accordingly , the injectivity of @xmath131 is undecidable .",
    "the question of the surjectivity of the global function of cellular automata in the hyperbolic plane is still open . in the euclidean case ,",
    "the undecidability of the surjectivity problem is derived from the undecidability of the injectivity as the surjectivity of the global function of a cellular automaton is equivalent to its injectivity on the set of finite configurations , see  @xcite .",
    "now , in the case of cellular automata in the hyperbolic plane , this is not at all the case .",
