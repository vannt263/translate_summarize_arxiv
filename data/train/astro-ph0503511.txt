    "the existence of supermassive black holes ( sbhs ) in the centers of galaxies has been the subject of numerous recent studies .",
    "stellar and gas - dynamical measurements in nearby galaxies and reverberation mapping on high - redshift active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have shown that sbhs with masses @xmath1 reside in the centers of spheroidal systems , these being elliptical galaxies and the bulges of spiral galaxies ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "the inferred black hole masses together with measurements of the absolute luminosity of the host spheroids , have revealed a correlation between the mass of the central supermassive black hole , @xmath2 , and the mass of its host spheroid @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "similarly , detailed studies of the stellar velocity dispersions @xmath4 , in the host spheroids have revealed an even tighter correlation with the mass of the black hole that it is harboring @xcite . the black hole ( bh ) and",

    "models of sbh formation and growth should address the following questions .",
    "* when and where do supermassive black holes , and/or the _ seed _ black holes from which they grow , form ? * how do these black holes evolve to the masses that we observe in the local universe ? * what is the fundamental coupling that connects the stellar dynamics of the bulge to the central black hole ? * what testable predictions can be used to falsify the model ?    in this paper , we show how gravitational wave detectors can be used to test models of seed bh formation .",

    "this is a result with interesting consequences .",
    "it provides a method for falsifying models with high - mass black holes seeds , such as the kbd model , for studying the parameters of the kbd - like models , for assessing the importance of mergers in the formation of sbhs , and the establishment of the observed correlations between sbhs and their host spheroids . as we elaborate on below",
    ", an important implication then is that lisa can be used as a tool to study the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "moreover , if it were realized in nature , the gravity wave background that we compute , would represent a significant background contaminant to instruments like lisa and any others that are envisaged for operation in the low - frequency regime , such as the decihertz interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( decigo , * ? ? ? * ) or the big bang observer ( bbo ) , which could otherwise aim at measuring gravity wave backgrounds arising from the epoch of inflation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as a consequence of theories with large extra dimensions @xcite , or from supernovae @xcite .",

    "in particular , @xcite ( mr01 hereafter ) proposed a model where the seeds of sbhs formed at @xmath6 in rare halos ( @xmath7 peaks in the smoothed density field ) that are sufficiently massive that molecular hydrogen cooling allows runaway collapse of a significant amount of baryons .",
    "these baryons form a pressure - supported object of mass @xmath8 that is unstable and collapses to a bh on a timescale of @xmath9 $ ] myr .",
    "seed bhs in this model have a typical mass @xmath10 \\times 10 ^ 2 { m_{\\odot}}$ ] .",
    "this model is motivated by numerical studies that simulate an extremely dense environment at high - redshift in an attempt to identify the time and environment where the very first luminous objects in the universe form @xcite and evolve @xcite .",
    "the ramifications of such a scenario were investigated in detail by @xcite who demonstrated that subsequent mergers experienced by seed bhs during the formation of a galactic halo do not play a significant role in the growth of the sbh .",
    "instead , a finely - tuned accretion mechanism ensures that sbhs grow in such a way that the relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath11 is preserved .    alternatively , kbd proposed a model where seed bhs form from the low angular momentum material in proto - galactic disks at high redshift .",
    "this model predicts seed bhs of a specific mass scale , @xmath12 that reside in rare , massive halos at high redshift ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "bh growth via mergers is more important in this scenario and kbd demonstrated that the the slope of the relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be _ set by hierarchical merging _ , while the normalization of this relationship may be due to an accretion epoch at some lower redshift .",
    "additionally , kbd showed that if central bhs and their host spheroids are built by mergers , galaxies that do not contain bhs , will also be bulge - less .",
    "the transition is set at approximately @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and naturally explains the observational indication of a lower limit on @xmath2 .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to predict robustly observational signatures that can constrain or distinguish between sbh formation scenarios .",
    "sbhs may be assembled primarily through mergers of numerous small bhs or relatively fewer mergers of massive bhs .",
    "it may be the case that sbhs are formed through periods of possibly super - eddington accretion @xcite .",
    "one promising avenue for shedding light on the sbh formation mystery is the possible detection of the gravitational waves emitted from mergers during their hierarchical assembly @xcite . a space - based , interferometric gravity wave detector , such as the proposed lisa interferometer ,",
    "should be capable of detecting such merger events @xcite .",
    "for such an instrument , mergers of bhs with masses @xmath16 at redshifts from @xmath17 will be observable as strain perturbations , providing a new test of the viability of sbh growth through mergers .",
    "the relative importance of mergers and accretion in the growth of sbhs is still under debate .",
    "even if accretion is the dominant growth mechanism , as suggested by studies aiming at explaining the quasar luminosity function @xcite and the effect of feedback in the central regions of galaxies and clusters @xcite , the paradigm of hierarchical structure formation predicts that some growth must be due to mergers .",
    "in fact , it may be likely that mergers act as triggers for significant accretion @xcite .",
    "therefore , growth via mergers and accretion may be closely related .",
    "a detection of the gravitational wave background due to sbh mergers will directly address the frequency of sbh mergers as well as the bh masses involved in the mergers and hence constrain the relative importance of these events in galaxy formation .",
    "the key ingredients needed to calculate the consequences of hierarchical merging of seed bhs for lisa are the merger rate of bhs as a function of redshift and the distribution of bh masses involved in any particular merger event . @xcite calculated the merger rate using the extended press - schechter ( eps ) approximation @xcite convolved with the empirically - derived relationship between @xmath2 and the velocity dispersion of the host halo . in a similar approach , @xcite derived a prescription for the black hole occupation distribution and showed that ringdown events will be observed in future gravitational wave detectors .",

    "adopted a different method , incorporating bh formation and evolution into a more elaborate , semi - analytic model of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "another method for estimating merger rates was proposed by @xcite , who developed phenomenological models for mergers based on the number counts of quasars and spheroids .",
    "@xcite showed that different bh assembly scenarios could yield different gravitational wave signatures with calculations based on the runaway sbh formation scenario of @xcite .",
    "we present estimates of the merger rates and concomitant gravitational wave spectrum in a manner that is qualitatively similar to , but quantitatively different from the approach followed by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "is a characteristic seed bh mass of order @xmath18 , from which larger bhs must be built by mergers and/or accretion ( as opposed to @xmath19 in the mr01-motivated models ) .",
    "the strain induced during a merger event increases with the masses of the merging bhs while the characteristic frequencies decrease with bh mass ( precise dependencies depend on the phase of the merger ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "it seems reasonable then , that these scenarios result in distinct gravity wave signals .",
    "we make specific estimates of bh merger rates by populating halos at high redshift with bhs according to the kbd prescription and we model subsequent dynamics using an approximate , semi - analytic formulation presented by @xcite and expanded upon and tested against a suite of @xmath20-body simulations by @xcite .",

    "the host dark matter halos acquire their angular momenta through tidal torques induced by neighboring quadrupole fluctuations in the density field .",

    ", this disk is pressure - supported . as more mass",
    "is added to the disk , the presence of local gravitational instabilities starts to overcome the pressure support . in the inner parts of the disk , where such processes likely occur due to the higher densities , gravitational instabilities manifest themselves as an effective viscosity @xcite",
    "this viscosity leads to angular momentum transfer from the inner disk outward .",
    "some material in the inner disk loses angular momentum resulting in the flow of mass to the center .",
    "eventually , instabilities in the disk become fully dynamical and the first generation of stars forms .",
    "these first stars are thought to be massive , with lifetimes of order @xmath31myr @xcite .",
    "the presence of these first stars and their subsequent supernovae explosions likely result in significant heating of the disk . as the temperature of the disk increases , angular momentum transfer ceases to be effective and mass inflow stops .",
    "therefore , once gravitational instabilities become effective , the accumulation of mass at the center of the halo proceeds for a time @xmath32 and then stops .",
    "the above scenario assumes that the disk forms and evolves uninterrupted over many dynamical times .",
    "however , a major merger is likely to disrupt any disk and halt this process prematurely .",
    "thus this process proceeds in halos that are both large enough to cool their gas _ and do not experience major mergers_. in practice , the latter criterion proves most stringent .",
    "we estimate the major merger timescale as the average time for a halo to double its mass according to the eps approximation , then we require this timescale to be longer than the time required to go through the above process .",

    "in summary , the kbd model contains three key input parameters : the total fraction of mass that can cool via molecular hydrogen , @xmath44 ; the timescale for the evolution of the first stars , @xmath43 ; and the redshift at which reionization heats the igm to a degree that this process is no longer effective , @xmath46 . varying these parameters within a reasonable range ,",

    ", we use a semi - analytic model for halo mergers and the dynamical evolution of subhalos within larger host halos .",

    "these first two ingredients are based on the semi - analytic model of halo substructure evolution presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "once potential pairs are formed within a halo , we estimate the timescale over which the bhs move from a separation of order a large fraction of a @xmath57 to a separation close enough to emit gravitational radiation .",
    "we refer to this stage as _ migration_.      the first step is to establish a primordial population of seed bhs predicted by the kbd model . consider a halo of virial mass @xmath58 at @xmath59 .",
    "we use the extended press - schechter formalism @xcite to compute merger histories , which consists of a list of all of the smaller halos that merged together to form this final halo and the redshifts at which these mergers occurred .",
    "this is a monte carlo procedure and by repeating the procedure many times for the same host mass , we sample the variety of different accretion histories that lead to a halo of fixed mass at @xmath59 .",
    "we refer to each sample merger history that we construct as a merger history _",
    "realization_. in an individual realization , each merger represents a branch in the _ merger tree_. at each branch , each merging halo has its own merger history that we can follow and so on .",
    "the resulting merger tree structure describes the ways in which a halo of mass @xmath58 today breaks up into _ halos _ of various masses as a function of redshift .",
    "we use the particular implementation of the eps formalism advocated in @xcite , to which we refer the reader for further details .",
    "we follow each branch to higher redshift and smaller mass until one of two things happens .",
    "if the branch is above @xmath33 at some redshift @xmath60 , then we find the earliest time in its mass accretion history that the the halo mass was greater than @xmath33 . at this time",
    "we assign this the redshift of bh formation , @xmath61 .",
    "we choose the earliest time because we assume that subsequent mergers between super - critical halos do not restart the process described in ",
    "[ section : kbdmodel ] .",
    "this is because once a halo goes through the mechanism of bh formation described in ",
    "[ section : kbdmodel ] , the presence of metals left over from the first generation of stars in the disk alters the properties of the disk , making it significantly more susceptible to fragmentation .",
    "we then assign the halo a bh mass according to the probability distribution in equation [ eq : pmbh ] .",
    "alternatively , if there is no point on the branch where @xmath62 at @xmath60 , we eliminate this branch from further consideration . in this case , the halo does not meet the conditions necessary for the formation of a sbh seed and can not host a bh .    as an example of the product of this procedure , in figure  [ fig : bhi ]",
    "we show initial spectra of seed bh masses and formation times . in this specific demonstration",
    ", we calculate these quantities by averaging the results of @xmath55 merger histories of halos of final mass @xmath56 , comparable to the halo of the milky way @xcite , with our fiducial value of @xmath63 , as well as low and high reionization redshift alternatives @xmath54 and @xmath53 .",

    "the next step is to compute the evolution of the bhs and their host halos , as they merge .",
    "we do this using a semi - analytic model for the merging and evolution of substructure in a larger main halo described in detail by @xcite . in this section",

    "roughly speaking , the deceleration due to dynamical friction is proportional to the bound mass of the subhalo , so the loss of mass due to the tides raised by the potential of the main halo must also be modeled in order to make an estimate of the timescale on which subhalos bring bhs to the central regions of the main halo .",
    "we track the evolution of subhalos as they evolve in the growing , main system in the following way . at each merger event , we first assign initial orbital energies and angular momenta to infalling subhalos according to the probability distributions culled from cosmological @xmath20-body simulations @xcite .",
    "we then integrate the orbit of the subhalo in the main halo from the time of accretion to the present day .",

    "first , the dynamical timescales in the central halo are quite short so that very small timesteps are needed to integrate the orbit and the calculation becomes unmanageable .",
    "second , our simple model of subhalo evolution is not applicable near the centers of halos where interactions with the central galaxies often dominate interactions with halo potentials .",
    "we follow the approach of @xcite and cease tracking the orbits of all subhalos and bhs that reach an apocentric distance from the center of the main halo that is less than @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the virial radius of the main halo .",

    "as we showed in the previous subsection , we track bhs until the distance between the parent bh and the merging bh is @xmath84 .",
    "this distance is much larger than the distance where gravitational radiation becomes an important channel for energy loss from the pairs .",
    "somehow , the infalling satellite bhs in the potential pairs must _ migrate _ to the center .",
    "this can be achieved either through stellar interactions @xcite , or various gas dynamical effects @xcite .",

    "lisa should be able to observe the relatively simple , well - understood phase of bh binary inspiral over more than @xmath202 orders of magnitude in frequency .",
    "most previous studies employed significant growth of central bhs through accretion @xcite . in our model we do not include such a prescription , for two reasons . first , we would like to examine the robustness of the kbd model and its predicted gravitational wave spectrum .",
    "the spectrum would only be boosted by additional accretion onto central bhs .",
    "secondly , current prescriptions for accretion onto bhs that grow via mergers are uncertain and must be tuned in order to reproduce observed correlations at @xmath59 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , specific prescriptions for accretion can easily be incorporated into the framework of our calculation should growth through accretion become more well understood .",
    "the general shape of the gravity wave spectrum can be understood in the following way . as the frequency of emission depends on the mass of the pair",
    ", the high - frequency regime is dominated by the mergers of relatively low - mass bhs with the original seed bh mass , while the low - frequency regime originates from the merger of more massive pairs .",
    "the spectrum drops steeply at the high - frequency end for two reasons .",
    "first , the spectra from individual mergers drop sharply at a maximal frequency set by the mass scale of the merging black holes , in this case the mass scale of the kbd seed bhs ( see   [ sub : gw_binary ] ) .",
    "second , due to the hierarchical build - up of sbhs that we describe in this study , small masses contribute primarily at higher redshifts than high - mass bh pairs ( see figure [ fig : m1_mr_z ] ) .",
    "the frequency of emitted radiation by small mass bhs experiences a larger redshift toward lower frequencies than that from corresponding pairs of larger mass bhs , resulting in a steepening of the gravity wave spectrum at high frequencies .",
    "the apparent cutoff that is seen at low frequencies basically reflects an upper limit on the resulting mass of bhs at @xmath59 . if the bh masses at @xmath59 are the result of merging of smaller mass bhs as we assume in this study , then this mass is directly proportional to the mass of seed bhs as well as the number of mergers that occurred in the process of forming the bh at @xmath59 .",
    "the sharpness of the cutoff results from our choice of a fixed value of the parameter @xmath226 .",
    "if instead we were able to assign a different value of @xmath126 for each one of the coalescing pairs , then the decline at lower frequencies would be smooth .",
    "our choice of a fixed value of @xmath126 for all pairs simplifies the calcualtion but does not change the essential results ( see below ) .",
    "we emphasize that our results are robust to variations of the migration timescale @xmath85 .",
    "we can understand this directly from fig .",
    "[ fig : n_z ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : m1_mr_z ] .",
    "these figures show that most of the potential bh pairs in this model are formed quite early on ( @xmath227 ) and , moreover , that many of these mergers are between the near - equal - mass seed bhs .",
    "thus , most pairs have of order @xmath87  many  gyr to evolve toward inspiral and begin emitting appreciable gravity waves . varying @xmath85 from @xmath118  myr to @xmath118  gyr results in only a small reduction in the gravitational wave background .",
    "only pairs that merge at redshifts @xmath92 are excluded by this criterion and the number of these pairs is comparably quite small , as can be gleaned from fig .",
    "[ fig : n_z ] . the only way to reduce significantly",
    "the signal would be to require migration times in excess of a hubble time .",
    "similarly , lowering the minimum frequency ( or equivalently , increasing the maximum binary separation ) at which gravitational radiation becomes the primary channel for energy loss , parameterized by @xmath228 , allows bh binaries to spend more time evolving through the inspiral phase , boosting the low - frequency signal , which is dominated by inspiral , and reducing the high - frequency signal , where the subsequent phases of merger , ringdown , and decay dominate .",
    "varying the value of @xmath126 from @xmath229 to @xmath230 results in , at maximum , an increase of @xmath192 by a factor of @xmath231 in the low - frequency regime . on the other hand ,",
    "increasing the value of @xmath126 up to @xmath232 , the decrease in the characteristic strain is at most a factor of @xmath233 .",
    "therefore , varying the values of @xmath85 and @xmath126 within their expected ranges does not significantly alter the main result of this study .",
    "as we have already mentioned , unlike the parameters @xmath126 and @xmath85 , the gravity wave spectrum _ is _ sensitive to the redshift of reionization , @xmath46 ( or any other cosmological epoch that effectively terminates the kbd process ) . in our fiducial model",
    ", we follow kbd and adopt a value of @xmath51 , which is shown by the thin , solid lines fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_split ] .",
    "taking a higher reionization redshift , as indicated by the cosmic microwave background polarization anisotropy @xcite , significantly reduces the low - frequency signal .",
    "the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_split ] show the results for the kbd model with @xmath52 . in the frequency range of interest , the strain spectrum in this case",
    "is decreased by at most an order of magnitude relative to the fiducial case .",
    "notice that in the frequency range at which lisa is most sensitive ( @xmath234 ) , the relative decrease is much smaller .",
    "the dominant reason for the reduction in the background at low frequency is that there are considerably fewer seed bhs in a model where the kbd mechanism is cut off at this high a redshift ( see   [ sub : pophalos ] ) .",
    "most previous studies have assumed that central bhs merge , one after the other , with infalling bhs .",
    "@xcite point out that this may not necessarily hold because the gravity waves emitted during the merger are not emitted isotropically and may induce a recoil on the center of mass of the system that can be large compared to the escape velocities from typical dark matter halos . in this case , bhs can continue to merge _ only _ if some mechanism returns them to the centers of halos .",
    "we estimated the affect of this recoil on our predicted spectrum by allowing bhs to recoil with the _ maximum _ recoil velocity estimated in @xcite .",
    "in this scenario , seed bhs effectively merge once and are then cut off from further mergers .    at the low frequency end ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : spectrum_split ] ) , the spectrum in the recoil scenario is roughly an order of magnitude lower than in our fiducial model ; however , the reduction is significantly less at higher frequencies , particularly at the trough in the lisa noise spectrum .",
    "the signal should still be detectable at high signal - to - noise by lisa at frequencies in excess of a few @xmath235 .",
    "again , the reason that this model is robust to the recoils is simple . in this seed",
    "bh formation scenario , bhs start with very large masses ( @xmath236 ) compared to the mr01-motivated models ( @xmath237 ) .",
    "mergers between these seeds already produce a sizable strain compared to the lisa noise curve .",
    "therefore , even if the aggregation of bhs is cut - off after a single merger due to the recoil , the gravity wave background may still be quite large in the frequency regime that lisa will probe most reliably .",
    "finally , we present results for an extreme scenario that represents the minimal signal that can result from the type of bh formation model that we study here . in this extreme case",
    ", we include the maximum velocity recoil and the redshift of reionization is set to @xmath52 .",
    "in addition , we assume that the initial mass spectrum of bhs ( see fig.[fig : bhi ] ) is shifted to smaller mass by a factor of @xmath238 . in this case , the characteristic bh mass is of order @xmath239 . in our estimate",
    ", we make this shift artificially , simply by resetting the kbd masses , but physically such a shift may be due to some unknown efficiency parameter associated with the formation of very massive bhs . in the case of the kbd model ,",
    "seeds of this low mass would primarily form if only @xmath240 of the mass that loses its angular momentum within @xmath47  myr actually collapses into a black hole . the resultant gravity wave signal from this extreme model",
    "is represented by the short - dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_split ] .",
    "the gravity wave background is significantly smaller in this model .",
    "notice that because the bhs are smaller and there is minimal growth of bh mass via mergers , the low - frequency signal is essentially gone . however , if supermassive black holes are formed from such an extreme case of the kbd model , the dominant mode of sbh growth must be through accretion .    in general , we note that the backgrounds presented here may still compete with other hypothetical backgrounds associated with , for example , galactic and extragalactic white dwarf binaries @xcite , the formation of the first generation of stars @xcite , supernovae @xcite or excitations of additional degrees of freedom in theories of spacetimes with large extra dimensions @xcite ,      as we showed in section   [ sub : stochasticity ] , the gravity wave background will be resolved into individual sources with a signal - to - noise ratio of greater than 5 for most of the lisa frequency range .",
    "we can therefore estimate the number of sources that will be resolved in a given observation time .",
    "we assume as before that this time is 3 years , and we estimate the number of sources that are resolved in each one of the phases of gravity wave emission for each pair .",
    "we do this in the following way . for each potential pair",
    ", we estimate the signal - to - noise ratio for the inspiral and merger phases using eq .",
    "( [ eq : sninspiralmerger ] ) . for the inspiral phase",
    ", we define the frequency interval @xmath194 , as the difference between @xmath122 and the frequency that the binary was emitting , 3 years ( the observation time ) before reaching @xmath122 ( estimated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : time_in ] ) ) .",
    "we perform the integral over frequency in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sninspiralmerger ] ) and determine whether the signal - to - noise ratio meets the requirement @xmath241 .",
    "for the merger phase , we perform the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sninspiralmerger ] ) with @xmath242 . in the case of the ringdown phase , we approximate the energy spectrum as a @xmath243-function at the ringdown frequency , following the analysis of @xcite . in this case",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is given by @xmath244 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath245 , and @xmath134 is as usual the dimensionless spin parameter .",
    "we perform these @xmath193 estimates for each pair in all halo masses of our merger tree realizations .",
    "we then calculate the mean number of events per redshift interval , @xmath246 , and follow the analogous sequence going from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dndvdt ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ntotal ] ) to get the total number of events with @xmath241 in a 3 year of observation with lisa .",
    "we find that for our fiducial case with @xmath63 , @xmath247 and @xmath248 that in a 3 year integration , lisa should be able to measure @xmath249 inspiral , @xmath250 merger and @xmath251 ringdown events above a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath241 .",
    "for the case with the same set of parameters but including also the effects of radiation recoil described in section ",
    "[ sub : kicks ] , the corresponding number of resolved events in the inspiral , merger and ringdown phases is 250 , 700 and 500 respectively , while for the extreme scenario with maximum radiation recoil , a redshift of reionization of @xmath52 and seed bh masses which are two orders of magnitude lower from the fiducial kbd mass scale these numbers are 1 , 60 and 0.1 . in all cases ,",
    "the number of merger and ringdown events is higher than the number of inspiral events .",
    "the reason is due to the fact that most of the black hole masses involved ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : n_z ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : m1_mr_z ] ) are such that the signal - to - noise ratio during merger and ringdown is generally larger than the signal - to - noise of inspiral .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "the inspiral signal - to - noise ratio is roughly a factor @xmath252 smaller than the signal - to - noise ratio for merger and/or ringdown events and , in many cases , inspiral binaries do not enter the lisa sensitivity range until only few weeks prior to the merger and subsequent ringdown phase .    as with the gravity wave spectrum ,",
    "the numbers of resolved events reflect the underlying characteristics of the kbd model .",
    "massive seed black holes which are formed early experience a large number of mergers .",
    "in addition , the seed masses are such that the emitted gravity wave radiation is in the frequency range of a space detector such as lisa . in supermassive black hole formation scenarios which are based on the mr01 model for seed bh formation , seed masses are generally small . as such , the emitted radiation does not move into the lisa frequency range until relatively lower redshifts , at which time the merger rate of the halos that host black holes is significantly decreased .",
    "thus , just as the gravity wave background , the number of resolved events in mr01 models is generally significantly smaller than what is found in kbd - type high - mass bh seed models .",
    "in this paper , we studied the theoretical gravitational wave background predicted by models where supermassive black holes form from a population of high mass seeds and models where mergers are an important channel of sbh growth .",
    "we studied as a particular example , the supermassive bh seed formation scenario of @xcite .",
    "our primary results can be summarized as follows .    *",
    "the kbd seed bh formation scenario makes a _ generic and testable _ prediction of a very large gravity wave background that should be resolvable at high signal - to - noise by a space gravity wave detector such as the proposed lisa interferometer .",
    "this prediction is insensitive to many of the details of the model .",
    "in addition , we have neglected any model of bh growth via accretion which would serve to increase the signal .",
    "this has the important implication that instruments with lisa characteristics should be able to confirm or to rule out the kbd scenario and similar models with high mass bh seeds and that future gravity wave detectors should be able to help assess the importance of mergers in the formation of sbhs and the establishment of the observed correlations between the black hole mass and the properties of its host spheroid and halo .",
    "moreover , if the background is detected , an instrument like lisa may be able to study the spectrum in detail providing constraints on some of the uncertain aspects of the model . * in general",
    ", the detectability of the predicted gravitational wave background is not sensitive to the details of the mechanism of bh migration if bh seeds are formed at high redshift .",
    "as long as migration occurs on a timescale less than @xmath253 , gravity waves from the inspiral phase of the mergers should still be observable .",
    "* for kbd - like models with an initial mass function of bh seeds that has a typical mass scale of @xmath16 , the gravity wave signal is robust to shifts in the redshift of reionization and a very generous reduction in the number of mergers due to radiation recoil effects and three body interactions .",
    "* while the magnitude of the gravity wave background means that it provides a means of testing bh formation mechanisms , such a signal would also represent a significant background contaminant for any future low - frequency , gravity wave observatories such as bbo or decigo @xcite .",
    "the gravity wave signal due to models of high - mass seeds would represent a potentially large stochastic background because any such instrument would have a greater sensitivity than lisa .",
    "this large background may then inhibit such detectors from achieving their aims of detecting the stochastic gravity wave backgrounds produced during inflation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , from a first generation of supernovae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or perhaps from other nonstandard physics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the modeling that we present here can be used to provide detailed predictions for the gravity wave signals from a wide class of models of bh formation and their subsequent growth ( including growth via accretion ) and merging .",
    "a detection of a gravitational wave background will be an enormous discovery in and of itself .",
    "one important reason is that it will open up a new window with which to observe the high - redshift universe .",
    "we showed that such a detection may yield important information about the formation and subsequent evolution of supermassive bhs .",
    "the presence of a background similar to our predictions would suggest the presence of numerous merger events , providing indirect evidence for a high merger rate of massive bhs .",
    "however , it is hard to disentangle the merger rate from any signal because of a degeneracy between the bh masses and the redshifts that gravitational waves are emitted @xcite unless independent redshifts measurements can be made .",
    "though this may be possible for individual merger events , in the case of a stochastic background this remains an outstanding difficulty .",
    "further information may be gleaned if spectral features are present in the spectrum . in this calculation",
    ", we neglected the gravitational wave emission that may result from the initial collapse of the seed bhs .",
    "this could result in the presence of a broadened `` emission line '' at a frequency which would correspond roughly to the redshifted quasi - normal - ringing frequency of the initial bh seed , and constrain the mass of seed bhs ( see @xcite for a discussion of the gravitational wave emission from collapsing objects ) .",
    "if the background could be measured at high signal - to - noise , the broadening of the line would provide information on the redshift of seed bh formation as well as the spectrum of seed bh mass , while the amplitude of the feature would indicate the abundance of the host halos that harbor the seed bhs @xcite .",
    "a non - detection of this predicted background would place very strong limits on the viability of the model proposed by @xcite and similar models of sbh formation from high - mass seeds .",
    "most notably it would severely constrain the mass and abundance of seed bhs .",
    "if this background were not detected , then bh seeds would be required to be significantly smaller than the seeds proposed by kbd ( @xmath254 ) or significantly scarcer .",
    "lack of a detection would indicate that growth via mergers of numerous pairs is not the dominant growth mechanism of sbhs and that kbd seed bhs must be so rare that they play , at most , a very limited role in the formation of sbhs in the centers of galaxies . in this case ,",
    "growth via accretion would have to be the dominant growth mechanism .",
    "if , in fact , this is the case , then there might be consequences for the spin evolution of bhs as was pointed out by @xcite .",
    "these points demonstrate how a gravity wave detector like lisa will open a fundamentally new window on the high - redshift universe , providing a wealth of information on the formation and growth of supermassive black holes and probing the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "lisa will probe galaxy formation processes at very high redshift , a task not attainable by other forms of observation except for possibly 21  @xmath255 emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "supermassive bhs and their formation are directly linked to the formation of galaxies .",
    "information gained from the gravitational wave background induced from bh mergers will inevitably provide useful constraints on high - redshift galaxy formation and insight into the processes that set the observed correlations between supermassive bhs and their hosts .",
    "an instrument with the sensitivity and frequency range similar to lisa will be able to confirm , disprove , or distinguish between mechanisms of sbh formation that produce otherwise identical predictions at @xmath59 ( a not uncommon situation as many models have tunable parameters ) .",
    "we demonstrated in this manuscript how lisa will be able to distinguish between the gravitational wave background induced by the kbd model seed bhs and the models that stem from the mr01 scenario .",
