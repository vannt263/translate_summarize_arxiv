    "<S> to do so , we need to measure the cp effects(phase ) independently by using the other oscillation mode . </S>",

    "<S> the effect from @xmath2 depends on the magnitude of @xmath12 so that it is an index to know the cp dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we discussed where is better set of the baseline length @xmath13 and the neutrino energy @xmath14 to extract the cp effect from @xmath15 experiment and pointed out it favors @xmath16 , @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> at once , we showed it seems to be difficult to determine the cp phase because there is a correlation between @xmath18 and @xmath2 in small @xmath19 @xcite .    in this letter , we introduce a new index @xmath0 to look for the better region in @xmath20 plane and to avoid the uncertainty from @xmath18-@xmath21 correlation . here </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath18-@xmath21 correlation is plotted in fig.1 , where we assume @xmath26 as the true values and the plotted points show where the probability @xmath27 at the fake values @xmath28 are almost same with @xmath29 at true value . </S>",

    "<S> if the relation are satisfied , it means one can not determine the magnitude of cp phase without uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> namely , for the error of @xmath33 , all range of @xmath34 is satisfied as the solution . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , even if the error is @xmath35 level , @xmath36 , we have to consider the uncertainty .    from the left of fig.1 </S>",
    "<S> , one can find the linear relation between @xmath37 and @xmath30 for several baseline lengths . </S>",
    "<S> the right figure shows the dependence of fake region of @xmath37 on the baseline length @xmath13 at the case of @xmath38 which leads to same probability @xmath27 with true ( input ) value @xmath39 . from this </S>",

    "<S> one can find that the fake region breaks at several @xmath13s in the right of fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> hence we investigate around @xmath40 where the fake region disappears .    at @xmath41 , the correlation of @xmath37 and @xmath30 </S>",

    "<S> the dependence seems to be different with the case in fig.1 and the almost plotted points are around the true value @xmath42 at the @xmath13 where the fake regions disappear in fig.1 . </S>",

    "<S> where is the region on ( @xmath44 ) ? comparing the right one of fig.1 with the fig.2(right ) which shows the dependence of the probability on the baseline length l , where the probability shows maximal or minimal . </S>",
    "<S> the fake regions also break around @xmath45 but the probability is almost @xmath46 so that we can not extract the cp effect around the @xmath13 . on the other hand , at @xmath47 , @xmath27 shows maximal and the cp effects will also be maximal so that it may be possible to determine the cp phase without depending on @xmath48 so hard . </S>",

    "<S> the regions which the new index is as small as possible are favored to avoid the effects from @xmath43 . on the other hands , to determine the cp phase , the regions the dependence on @xmath2 becomes larger are favored . using @xmath10 </S>",
