    "there is a natural topology on @xmath10 which is called the _ cone topology_. unfortunately , the boundary of a cat(0 ) space is not a quasi - isometry invariant : in  @xcite croke and kleiner construct examples of a group @xmath1 which acts properly and cocompactly by isometries on different spaces whose boundaries are not homeomorphic",

    "he then asked whether all such boundaries are ce - equivalent .",
    "much progress has been made in classifying boundary types of various groups ( for example see @xcite and @xcite ) , but bestvina s question remains open .    given a cat(0 ) space @xmath2 and a subset @xmath11",

    "a fundamental theorem of geometric group theory states that if a group @xmath1 acts geometrically on a proper metric space @xmath2 , then @xmath2 is quasi - isometric to @xmath1 with the word metric .",
    "in particular , if @xmath1 acts geometrically on two cat(0 ) spaces @xmath2 and @xmath3 , then there is a @xmath1-equivariant quasi - isometry from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "one may take the image of a geodesic ray in @xmath2 under this quasi - isometry , and examine its boundary limit in @xmath3 .",
    "it is not hard to see that such boundary limits must be compact , connected , and finite dimensional .",
    "the main result of this chapter is that these are the only restrictions we can put on the homeomorphism types of such boundary limits :    [ t : main ] let @xmath0 be any connected , compact subset of euclidean space .",

    "our construction of @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath16 depends only on @xmath17 , thus all @xmath18 arise as boundary limits obtained from one particular quasi - isometry .    the construction in this chapter is heavily influenced by the constructions of croke and kleiner in @xcite and its generalizations by c. mooney in @xcite .",

    "call these spaces @xmath39 . denote by @xmath40 the generators of the @xmath32 factor of @xmath1 .",
    "we may chose these generators so that the subgroup @xmath41 , acts geometrically on @xmath42 , via translations by @xmath25 , such that @xmath43 translates by @xmath44 and the standard generators of @xmath45 translate by @xmath27 .",
    "indeed , this allows us to assume that the last @xmath17 coordinates of each @xmath42 correspond exactly to the @xmath46 factor of @xmath2 .",
    "we will use the symbol  @xmath47 for this group action .    define a group automorphism @xmath48 in the following way : choosing generators @xmath27 of @xmath45 in the standard way , let @xmath49 .",

    "since @xmath52 and @xmath47 have the same effect on the @xmath34 component of @xmath2 , we immediately see that @xmath107 is the identity on the @xmath44 component of @xmath42 .",
