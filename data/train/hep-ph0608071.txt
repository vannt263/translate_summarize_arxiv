    "the gluonium states of qcd have remained intriguing for almost four decades@xcite .",
    "their `` exotic '' nature reflects itself not least in several long - standing problems which the qcd sum rule approach faces in the spin-0 glueball channels@xcite . in the scalar ( @xmath0 ) glueball correlator ,",
    "in particular , the departure from asymptotic freedom sets in at unusually small distances@xcite and the perturbative wilson coefficients of the standard operator product expansion ( ope ) proved inadequate to establish consistency both among the @xmath0 glueball sum rules and with an underlying low - energy theorem@xcite .",
    "although nonperturbative contributions due to direct ( i.e. small ) instantons@xcite were early candidates for the missing short - distance physics@xcite , insufficient knowledge of the instanton size distribution@xcite prevented their quantitative implementation at the time .",
    "only recently , the derivation of the exact instanton contributions ( to leading order in @xmath1 ) , their duality continua and the corresponding borel sum - rule analysis@xcite showed that direct instantons indeed solve the mentioned key problems in the scalar glueball channel . below",
    "we will outline a more thorough and systematic treatment@xcite which eliminates artefacts of earlier approximations , significantly modifies the sum - rule results in both spin-0 channels and improves their reliability .",
    "moreover , we implement for the first time topological charge screening contributions to the ope in the @xmath2 channel@xcite and show how those resolve earlier sum - rule inconsistencies@xcite .",
    "finally , we review several new predictions for spin-0 glueball properties .",
    "the spin-0 glueball sum rules are based on the scalar @xmath3 and pseudoscalar @xmath4 correlations functions @xmath5 where @xmath6 with @xmath7 are the gluonic interpolating fields ( of lowest mass dimension ) @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath10 ( the definition in ref .",
    "contains a typo ) .",
    "the zero - momentum limit of the correlator ( [ corr ] ) is  governed by the low - energy theorems ( lets ) @xmath11 in the scalar@xcite and ( for three light flavors and @xmath12)@xmath13 in the pseudoscalar channel@xcite .",
    "( note that eq .",
    "( [ pslet ] ) vanishes in the chiral limit . )",
    "consistency with the low - energy theorems places stringent constraints on the sum rules which can not be satisfied without nonperturbative short - distance physics@xcite .",
    "contact with the hadronic information in the glueball correlators is established by means of the dispersive representation@xmath14 where the necessary number of subtractions is implied but not written explicitly . the standard sum - rule description of the spectral functions @xmath15 contains one or two resonance poles in zero - width approximation , @xmath16 , and the local - duality continuum @xmath17 from the iope discontinuities in the  duality range  which starts at an effective threshold @xmath18 .    in order to write down qcd sum rules , the borel - transformed iope and dispersive representations of the correlators - weighted by @xmath19 powers of",
    "@xmath20 - are matched in the fiducial @xmath21-region ( @xmath21 is the borel variable ) and rearranged in terms of the continuum - subtracted borel moments @xmath22 as @xmath23 the pole contributions of interest ( and for @xmath24 the crucial subtraction terms ) are then isolated on the rhs , and the hadronic parameters @xmath25 and @xmath18 can be determined numerically .",
    "our theoretical framework , the instanton - improved operator product expansion ( iope ) , factorizes the correlators at large , spacelike momenta @xmath26 into contributions from `` hard '' field modes ( with momenta @xmath27 ) in the wilson coefficients @xmath28 and `` soft '' field modes ( with @xmath29 ) in the `` condensates '' @xmath30 of operators @xmath31 with increasing dimension @xmath32 .",
    "previous glueball sum rules based on the ope with purely perturbative wilson coefficients were plagued by notorious inconsistencies between the predictions of different moment sum rules and by massive let violations . moreover , the soft nonperturbative condensate contributions were exceptionally small .",
    "we have therefore analyzed _ hard _ nonperturbative contributions to the wilson coefficients .",
    "they are strongly channel dependent and due to direct instantons and topological charge screening .",
    "the instanton contributions to the spin-0 coefficients@xcite , @xmath33 are large ( while those in the @xmath34 tensor channel vanish ) and add to the unit - operator coefficients @xmath35 .",
    "the imginary part of their fourier transform at timelike momenta generates the borel moments@xcite@xmath36 which are similar or larger in size than the perturbative ones .",
    "the evaluation of these moments requires as the sole input the ( anti- ) instanton distribution @xmath37 which is implemented by means of a lattice - based gaussian - tail parametrization with the correct small-@xmath38 behavior , @xmath39 ( for @xmath40 ) , which was introduced in ref . and",
    "shown to prevent several artefacts of the oversimplified `` spike '' approximation @xmath41 on which all previous direct - instanton calculations had relied .    as an additional benefit ,",
    "the realistic size distribution allows for a gauge - invariant ir renormalization which excludes large instantons with size @xmath42 from the wilson coefficients , @xmath43 ( @xmath44 is a soft step function ) .",
    "the instanton - induced @xmath45 dependence turns out to be relatively weak for @xmath46 , as necessary to compensate its perturbative counterpart .",
    "neglect of this renormalization , although common practice in perturbative wilson coefficients , would significantly contaminate the results , e.g. by missing the reduction of the direct - instanton density@xmath47 another important renormalization effect is the reduction of the instanton contributions to the pseudoscalar relative to the scalar sum rules .",
    "the instanton s self - duality causes a strongly repulsive contribution to the @xmath2 channel , with seemingly detrimental impact on the sum rules@xcite : the glueball signal disappears and both unitarity and the let ( [ pslet ] ) are badly violated .",
    "the origin of these problems can be traced to the neglect of topological charge screening@xcite . due to their high channel selectivity and a small screening length @xmath48 fm , the model - independent screening correlations@xcite @xmath49 ( @xmath50 is the overall topological charge density ( @xmath51 for instantons ) and @xmath52 the flavor - singlet part of the @xmath53 ) affect almost exclusively the @xmath2 wilson coefficients .",
    "they arise from the axial - anomaly induced attractive ( repulsive ) interaction between topological charge lumps of opposite ( equal ) sign due to @xmath52 exchange@xcite and , after correcting for @xmath54 mixing , add the terms @xmath55 to the pseudoscalar iope moments .",
    "they strongly reduce the direct - instanton induced repulsion and resolve the disastrous problems mentioned above@xcite : positivity of the spectral function is restored , the four @xmath2 borel sum rules ( [ csubtrbmoms ] ) are stable and contain consistent pseudoscalar glueball information .",
    "( all previous analyses had discarded the @xmath24 sum rule and thereby missed valuable first - principle information and let consistency checks . )",
    "we have implemented direct instanton and topological charge screening contributions into the ope coefficients of the spin-0 glueball correlators , evaluated their duality continuua and demonstrated how these contributions resolve the problems of previous qcd sum rule analyses@xcite . a lattice - based instanton size distribution and the gauge - invariant ir renormalization of the nonperturbative wilson coefficients were also introduced .",
    "quark admixtures , and thereby quarkonium mixing effects , enter through quark loops , the instanton size distribution and the condensates .    in the scalar channel ,",
    "the sizeable direct instanton contributions are indispensable for mutually and let consistent sum rules .",
    "their improved treatment reduces our earlier ( spike - distribution based ) result for the @xmath0 glueball mass to @xmath56 gev .",
    "( the mass stays well beyond 1 gev , however , in contrast to obsolete predictions based on purely perturbative coefficients . )",
    "this value is somewhat smaller than the quenched lattice results@xcite ( which will probably be reduced by light - quark effects ) and consistent with the broad glueball state found in a comprehensive @xmath57-matrix analysis@xcite .",
    "the systematics among our different borel moments likewise indicates a rather large width of the scalar glueball , @xmath58 gev .",
    "our prediction for the scalar glueball decay constant ,  @xmath59 gev , is several times larger than the value obtained when ignoring the nonperturbative wilson coefficients .",
    "this implies an exceptionally small @xmath0 glueball size , in agreement with several lattice results@xcite .",
    "another stringent , ope- and sum - rule - independent consistency check of the instanton contributions and their @xmath60 enhancement provide numerical simulations in an instanton ensemble@xcite ( ilm ) . for @xmath61 fm the scalar ilm and iope correlators are indeed very similar , and the ilm prediction @xmath62 gev is similarly large .",
    "this indicates a robust instanton effect and rules out that the large  @xmath60  may signal some eventual internal inconsistencies in the treatment of the instanton contributions@xcite .",
    "a subsequent model - independent confirmation of the @xmath60 enhancement was supplied by the first direct ( quenched ) lattice result@xcite @xmath63 gev which is consistent both with our prediction and the ilm value ( the latter is practically independent of quark quenching@xcite ) .",
    "our prediction for @xmath60 implies enhanced partial widths for radiative @xmath64 and @xmath65 decays into scalar glueballs and is therefore relevant for experimental glueball searches , e.g. in the cleo and bes data on @xmath66 and other decay branches .",
    "since the exceptionally small size and large decay constant are particular to the _ scalar _ glueball and since only part of the scalar  decay constant contributes to the radiative production rates@xcite , however , the above results are not ruled out by experimental data on decays into @xmath2 glueballs ( cf .",
    "ref . ) .    in the pseudoscalar ( @xmath2 ) glueball correlator we have identified and implemented a new type of nonperturbative contributions to the wilson coefficients , due to topological charge screening . roughly speaking , the screening effects `` unquench '' the direct instanton contributions , thereby restoring unitarity , the axial ward identity and the resonance signals .",
    "consistency among all moment sum rules and with the underlying let is also achieved , and the resulting mass prediction @xmath67 gev lies inside the range of quenched and unquenched lattice data .",
    "the coupling @xmath68 gev is somewhat enhanced by the topological short - distance physics , affecting radiative production rates , the @xmath69 cross section at high momentum transfers and other glueball signatures .    the crucial impact of the nonperturbative wilson coefficients on both spin-0 glueball correlators is particularly evident in the interplay between their subtraction constants .",
    "indeed , the notorious consistency problems which plagued previous @xmath0 glueball sum rules were primarily caused by the large let - induced subtraction constant @xmath70 gev@xmath71 ( cf .",
    "( [ slet ] ) ) : it can not be matched by perturbative wilson coefficients ( since @xmath72 ) and requires the direct instanton contribution @xmath73 gev@xmath71 . at first sight this seems to imply a conflict with the much smaller let subtraction constant @xmath74 gev@xmath71 ( cf .",
    "( [ pslet ] ) ) in the @xmath75 channel , however , since the instanton contributions to both spin-0 correlators are equal ( up to a sign ) . here",
    "the topological screening contributions @xmath76 gev@xmath71 from eq .",
    "( [ rscr ] ) prove indispensable : they restore consistency by canceling most ( and in the chiral limit , where @xmath77 , all ) of the instanton contributions : @xmath78 .    to summarize : contrary to naive expectation , the nonperturbative contributions to the ope  of the spin-0 glueball correlators reside primarily in the wilson coefficients ( i.e not in the condensates ) and are closely related to the topological vacuum structure .",
    "the nonperturbative short - distance physics resolves long - standing consistency problems of the associated qcd sum rules and generates a rather diverse set of new glueball predictions . a large part of the @xmath0 glueball mass and binding originates from direct instantons , for example , while their net effects in the @xmath75 channel are smaller and more subtle , due to cancellations between instanton and topological charge screening contributions ."
