    "it is demonstrated that these additional contributions are comparable to the lowest - order bchf corrections for almost all considered atomic properties .",

    "since the breit corrections to basic properties of cs are below 1% , we ignore the frequency dependence in the present analysis .",

    "the coulomb - hartree - fock value , + 7.47 mhz , has a sign opposite to that of experimental value -21.24(5 ) mhz from ref .",
    "the dominant correlation corrections to matrix elements arise because of core - shielding of externally applied fields ( e.g. nuclear fields for hfs constants ) and an additional attraction of a valence electron by an induced dipole moment of the core  @xcite .",

    "the correlated breit correction to valence energies appears in the second - order ; a sample diagram is drawn in fig .  [ fig_ebodiag ] .",

    "explicit expressions for contributions to matrix elements up to the third order were tabulated by @xcite .",
    "these authors provide formulas for a general perturbing potential with one and two  body parts . in the second and third orders there are 31 distinct diagrams involving one - body part of the perturbation and 28 diagrams containing only two - body part .",
    "certainly calculations of the breit corrections are less complicated in the breit - coulomb - hartree - fock basis , where the one - body perturbation is absent .",
    "another advantage of the bchf basis is an automatic inclusion of important relaxation effect discussed below .",
    "an adequate account for the relaxation effect correction in the chf basis would have required fifth - order calculations for matrix elements .",
    "the generalization of mbpt expressions to a simultaneous treatment of coulomb and breit interactions is straightforward : coulomb interaction lines are replaced by a sum of coulomb and breit interactions and particle ( hole ) lines by breit - coulomb - hartree - fock states ( see figs .",
    "[ fig_zrpabodiag ] and  [ fig_ebodiag ] . )",
    "together with the corrections linear in the breit interaction such approach introduces terms nonlinear in the breit interaction . strictly speaking these nonlinear terms have no meaningful theoretical basis and therefore have to be omitted .",
    "however , the breit contribution to atomic properties is relatively small and the much smaller terms nonlinear in the breit interactions can be neglected at the present level of accuracy .      in the chf basis",
    "the first - order corrections to valence energies @xmath56 and matrix elements @xmath57 due to the one - body part of the breit interaction are given by @xmath58 similar one - body breit corrections can be calculated as differences between lowest - order values found in the breit - coulomb- and coulomb - hartree - fock approximations @xmath59 in fig .",

    "there is a striking discrepancy between the two corrections for all these quantities . for example , the first - order correction to the @xmath60 hfs constant is -0.4% , while at the hartree - fock level the breit correction almost vanishes .    , and ( c ) electric - dipole transition amplitudes .",

    "the relative corrections to the energies and hfs constants are defined with respect to experimental values , and electric - dipole amplitudes with respect to coulomb - hartree - fock values .",
    "[ fig_relax ] ]    these large discrepancies are explained by a `` relaxation '' effect , i.e. modification of the hartree - fock potential through adjustment of core orbitals  @xcite . to illustrate this effect",

    "it is clear that the inclusion of breit interaction in the coulomb - hartree - fock equations ( i ) greatly simplifies many - body perturbation expansions , and ( ii ) automatically accounts for the significant relaxation effects . in other words ,",
    "compared to the traditional coulomb - hartree - fock formulation , the transformation to the breit - chf basis sums many - body diagrams involving the effective one - body breit interaction to all orders of perturbation theory .",
