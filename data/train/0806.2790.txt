    "dynamics of a near - threshold production of the lightest mesons and their interactions , especially the pion - pion interaction , are of lasting interest .",
    "a good understanding of the pion - pion scattering is essential as it provides a test for the chiral perturbation theory and the information about quark masses and the chiral condensate .",
    "the two - photon decay of light mesons represents an important source of information .",
    "in particular , the @xmath12 decay of light scalar mesons was considered as a possible tool to deduce their nature .",
    "also , the scalar - isoscalar sector is under much debate presently since more states are known ( including possible glueball candidates ) than can be fitted into a single multiplet .",
    "unfortunately , the existing experimental information from @xmath13 scattering has many conflicting data sets at intermediate energies and no data at all close to the threshold region of interest . for many years",
    "this fact has made it hard to obtain the conclusive results on @xmath13 scattering at low energies or in the sigma region .",
    "the so - called `` abc effect '' is among the oldest and still puzzling problems .",
    "almost fifty years ago abashian , booth , and crowe @xcite first observed an anomaly in the production of pion pairs in the reaction @xmath14he+@xmath15he+@xmath16 .",
    "this anomaly or abc effect stands for an unexpected enhancement in the spectrum of the invariant @xmath13 mass at masses of about 40 mev higher than @xmath17 .",
    "the subsequent experiments @xmath18he+@xmath19 @xcite , @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath21he+@xmath19 @xcite , @xmath22 with neutron beams @xcite and even @xmath23 @xcite independently confirmed this finding . this anomaly was also observed in the photoproduction of pion pairs , @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "it was revealed that the abc effect is of isoscalar nature since a similar effect was not observed in the @xmath25 reaction .",
    "the peak positions and widths vary for different bombarding energies and observation angles .",
    "initially , the low - mass enhancement was interpreted as being caused by an unusually strong @xmath26-wave @xmath13 interaction or as an evidence for the @xmath27 meson existence @xcite which shortly before was suggested by johnson and teller to provide saturation and binding in nuclei @xcite .",
    "it is usually accepted now that this enhancement is not an intrinsic two - pion property since there is no resonance structure in the @xmath13 scattering amplitude in this energy range .",
    "so any interpretation of the abc as a real resonance is very much in doubt ( for example , see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "it is generally believed that a system like that has to be associated with two nucleons when two pions ( both must be present ) are rescattered off them or both nucleons participate in elementary @xmath28 reactions ( predominantly via @xmath29 formation ) .",
    "actually , the origin of the abc effect must be looked for in the formation of light nuclei at intermediate energies ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    the presented complicated situation is reflected in the particle data group ( pdg ) table @xcite where the values quoted for the sigma mass and width , based on both the pole position and the breit - wigner parameter determinations , are very widely spread .",
    "the estimated mass and half - width are @xmath30 however , during the last years , the chiral perturbation theory and roy equations led to an accurate description of @xmath13 scattering at low energies and the precise determination of the mass and width of the @xmath31 resonance @xcite : @xmath32    all experiments conducted on the abc issue with the exception of low - statistics bubble - chamber measurements @xcite were inclusive measurements carried out preferentially with a single - armed magnetic spectrograph for detection of the fused nuclei .",
    "they allow one to find the two - pion invariant mass through the missing mass . very recently",
    ", exclusive measurements of reactions @xmath33 and @xmath34he@xmath35 have been carried out with complete kinematics in the energy range of the abc effect at celsius using the @xmath36 wasa detector @xcite .",
    "the importance of the strongly attractive @xmath37 channel was noted .",
    "surprisingly , the basic @xmath38 reaction in the @xmath37 region also shows an abc - like low-@xmath13 mass enhancement which deserves special attention .",
    "it confirms the earlier result in @xcite where the analyzing powers and cross sections for the abc enhancement production were measured for the reaction @xmath39 in the missing mass range @xmath40 .",
    "however , the big difference was observed in the width of the resonance cross section and it was concluded that the observed width in the isoscalar channel is not obviously just a simple result of the binding between the two @xmath29 states .",
    "it rather signals more complicated configurations in the wave function of the intermediate state , as would be expected for a nontrivial dibaryon state @xcite .",
    "this work aims to study whether this low-@xmath13 mass anomaly can survive in heavier systems in the @xmath12 channel .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after a brief description of the experiment and experimental setup ,",
    "the structure of measured invariant mass spectra of photon pairs is analyzed in sect.2 . as a cross - check ,",
    "a similar analysis is carried out in sect.3 but within the wavelet method . to elucidate the nature of the peak at @xmath41 ,",
    "different mechanisms of the observed @xmath12 pair enhancement are discussed in sect.4 . in sect.5 , experimental estimates for production cross sections and widths of @xmath1 mesons and hypothetical @xmath42 resonance are given .",

    "this point testifies also that there is no instrumental anomaly causing the @xmath42 peak .    because of smallness of the signal - to - background ratio in the r - resonance mass range ,",

    "an indication to a possible resonance structure in pp - collisions at the energies 1.36 and 1.2 gev was obtained by the celsius - wasa collaboration @xcite .",
    "however statistics in the invariant mass range 250 - 350 mev is low : only about 200 @xmath12 pairs without background subtraction was found .",
    "here we shall try to identify essential structures in the measured @xmath63 spectra without the background subtraction .",
    "a conventional method for such analysis is a wavelet transformation which is known as an efficient multiscale technique to reduce the presence of statistical noise and then extract physical parameters from the obtained smoothed form @xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional wavelet transform ( wt ) of a signal @xmath86 has a biparametric form .",
    "this allows wt to overcome the main shortcomings of the fourier transform such as nonlocality , infinite support and necessity of a broad band of frequencies to decompose even a short signal .",

    "a scale parameter @xmath92 characterizes the dilatation and @xmath93 is the translation in time or space . in this respect",
    "the wavelet function @xmath94 is a sort of a `` window function '' with a non - constant window width : high - frequency events are narrow ( due to the factor @xmath95 ) , while low - frequency wavelets are broader .",
    "the inverse transform is given by the formula @xmath96    the wavelet @xmath87 exists if @xmath97 .",
    "it holds , in particular , when the first @xmath98 moments are equal to zero @xmath99    due to freedom in the choice of the wavelet function @xmath87 , many different wavelets were invented .",
    "we consider here only continuous wavelets with vanishing moments ( wvm ) ( see it appendix a ) .",
    "the wvm family is called so because condition ( [ moment ] ) always holds for it .",
    "one of wvm families is a set of _ gaussian wavelets _ ( gw ) which are normalized derivatives of the gauss function @xmath100    in some cases continuous wavelets are more suitable to evaluate peak parameters .",
    "one of these cases arises when a peak in question has a gaussian shape ( [ oned ] ) .",
    "this makes it possible to use very simple analytical expressions , eq.([gausswavecoef ] ) , in the continuous gaussian wavelet transform for gaussian peaks .",
    "it gives us a remarkable advantage to calculate the peak parameters directly in the wavelet domain instead of the time / space domain _ without using the inversion_. moreover , in real cases , when our signal shape is close to a gaussian one and is considerably contaminated by an additive noise and , in addition , is distorted by binning to be input to computer , one can also use the remarkable robustness of gaussian wavelet filtering , as proved in @xcite .",
    "wavelet ability to separate signal components with different frequencies and positions has attracted many physicists to use both discrete and continuous wavelets @xcite .",
    "usually the conventional filtering approach is applied : a signal transformed by a wavelet undergoes an appropriate thresholding and then is restored by the inverse transform .",

    "a particular example of the @xmath102 transform and other details of this analysis are given in _",

    "i.e. _ the @xmath63 distribution including the background is presented in the upper panels of figs.[wlpc ] and [ wldc ] . here",
    "an additional condition on photon energies @xmath101 ( where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the smallest and the largest energy in the given photon pair , respectively ) was applied to data to improve the signal - to - background ratio and avoid double - humped structure which will require higher orders of the expansion .",

    "this spot has not a circle shape because even in the case of a coarse binning it is not well approximated by the gaussian ( see tabl.[tab2 ] ) . in this respect",
    ", the @xmath111-peak in @xmath10c seems to be more pronounced than the appropriate one in @xmath9c but it follows from lower statistics in the @xmath10c case where a separate point may be better approximated by the gaussian .",
    "note that statistics in these cases differs by the factor of more than 3 .",
    "the wvm analysis still reveals one more weak @xmath111-peak at higher @xmath63 .",
    "this is not very surprising since in coarse binning ( see fig.[f3 ] ) they were blurred but they are seen at a more strict selection ( cf .",
    "figs.[trig ] @xmath112 [ e_sel ] ) .",
    "therefore , the presented results of the continuous wavelet analysis with vanishing moments confirm the finding of a peak at @xmath113 in the @xmath12 invariant mass distribution obtained within the standard method with the subtraction of the background from mixing events .",
    "to simulate @xmath10c and @xmath9c reactions we use a transport code . at high energies",
    "it is the quark - gluon string model ( qgsm ) @xcite and at the energy of a few gev the string dynamics is reduced to the earlier developed dubna cascade model ( dcm ) @xcite with upgrade of elementary cross sections involved @xcite .",
    "the dcm divides the collision into three stages , well separated in time . during the first initial stage an intranuclear cascade develops ,",
    "primary particles can scatter and secondary particles can re - scatter several times prior to their absorption or escape from the nucleus . at the end of this step",
    "the coalescence model is used to localize @xmath9 , @xmath114,@xmath115he , and @xmath116he particles from nucleons found inside spheres with well - defined radii in configuration space and momentum space .",

    "some pre - equilibrium particles may be emitted and this leads to a lower excitation of the thermalized residual nuclei . in the third , final evaporation / fission stage of the reaction",
    ", the de - excitation of the residue is described with the evaporation model .",
    "the last two stages are important for triggering the events .",
    "all components contribute normally to the final spectra of particles and light fragments ; low - energy evaporated photons are not included into subsequent analysis . for relativistic energies the cascade part of the dcm",
    "is replaced by the refined cascade model , which is a version of the quark - gluon string model ( qgsm ) developed in @xcite and extended to intermediate energies in @xcite .",
    "the description of the mean - field evolution is simplified in the dcm in the sense that the shape of the scalar nuclear potential , defined by the local thomas - fermi approximation , remains the same throughout the collision . only the potential depth changes in time , according to the number of knocked - out nucleons .",
    "this frozen mean - field approximation allows us to take into account the nuclear binding energies and the pauli exclusion principle , as well as to estimate the excitation energy of the residual nucleus by counting the excited particle - hole states .",

    "to certain extent this enhancement at @xmath230 is similar to the puzzling abc effect observed for two - pion pairs from nucleon - nucleon and lightest nuclei collisions at the near threshold energy . in the given work",
    "we see that it exists in the @xmath12 channel and measurements are extended to a heavier system .",
    "it means that this resonance - like structure is a quite stable object which even survives in the nuclear surrounding .",
    "to understand the origin of the observed structure , several dynamic mechanisms were attempted : production of the hypothetic @xmath42 resonance in @xmath13 interactions during the evolution of the nuclear collision , formation of the @xmath42 resonance with participation of photons from the @xmath29 decay , the @xmath133 interaction effect in the @xmath231 channel of the @xmath1 decay , and a particular decoupled dibaryon mechanism .",
    "unfortunately , none of these mechanisms is able to explain the measured value of the resonance - like enhancement , though they contribute to the invariant mass in the region of interest .",

    "in contrast with all other experiments considered here , one may expect some manifestation of in - medium effects .",
    "the prominent feature of the @xmath1 meson is that the @xmath1-nucleon system couples dominantly to the @xmath232 resonance at the threshold energies .",
    "hence , due to the @xmath1 coupling to @xmath233-nucleon - hole modes , one could expect the eta meson nuclear dynamics to be sensitive to modification of nucleon and @xmath234 properties in medium . as was shown in @xcite , the @xmath1 spectral function at normal nuclear density",
    "has a second maximum near @xmath235 mev which may be associated to a partial chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "its two - photon decay inside a nucleus might give a rise to a maximum close to the measured value of @xmath42 .",
    "unfortunately , we can not perform transport calculations with taking into account the in - medium modification of hadron properties .",
    "as was noted in introduction , the recent data of the wasa - celsius collaboration provide a strong support to the idea of a nontrivial dibaryon state @xcite . an attractive candidate for its realization",
    "may be a model of the intermediate @xmath31-dressed dibaryon @xcite . in this model the short - range @xmath126 interaction , described by the standard @xmath114-channel @xmath31 exchange between two nucleons , is replaced with the respective @xmath26-channel @xmath31 exchange associated with the intermediate dibaryon production treated as a @xmath31-dressed six - quark bag .",
    "the strong scalar @xmath31-field arises around the symmetric @xmath236 bag , because the change in the symmetry of six - quark state in the transition from the @xmath126 channel to the intermediate dressed - bag state . due to a strong attraction of the @xmath31 meson to quarks , this intensive @xmath31",
    "field squeezes the bag and increases its density .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath26 channel mechanism would be generally much larger than the conventional t - channel one due to a resonance - like enhancement .",
    "the high quark density in the symmetric @xmath236 state enhances meson field fluctuations around the multiquark bag and thereby partially restores the chiral symmetry .",
    "therefore , the mass of @xmath31 meson gets much lower and has been estimated to be the value @xmath237 mev . in its turn",
    ", it should enhance the near - threshold pion and double - pion production @xcite .",
    "in addition , a large variety of nuclear data , in particular properties of short- and intermediate - range of @xmath126 and @xmath238 potentials , has been explained within this model ; however , still there is no direct quantitative calculations of the abc - like effects .    from the experimental side it is highly desirable to determine more accurately the mass , width , and cross section of the observed resonance structure by enlarging the acceptance .",
    "to verify the above conclusions new experiments are required to be carried out under conditions appropriate for detection of pairs of two photons within the invariant mass interval of 300 - 400 mev . in this respect experiments on proton and carbon targets with proton and deuteron beams at the same energy per nucleon",
    "would be very useful .",
    "some scanning in the beam energy will clarify the possible resonance structure of this effect . by varying the opening angle of the photon-2 spectrometer it is possible to get information about momentum spectra of the produced resonance - like structure which could be a delicate test of the @xmath42 production mechanism .",

    "the price of this redundancy consists in slow speed of calculations .",
    "besides , all signals to be analyzed have in practice a discrete structure .",
    "it is noteworthy that gw should be used with some care since they are nonorthogonal , which may disturb amplitudes of the filtered signal after their inverse transform . in this respect",

    "since the maximum location in the @xmath250 domain is stable when the signal is contaminated by some noise ( see @xcite ) , one can use the obtained point @xmath256 to start the fit .",
