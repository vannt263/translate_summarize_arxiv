    "are expected to resolve the singularity . in particular , the existence of the cosmological singularity in the framework of loop quantum gravity ( lqg)@xcite has been subject of study in the last years . however , at the present time , it is not possible to realize a consistent quantum gravity theory which leads to the unification of gravitation with the other forces . in particular , the theory of gravitational waves ( gw ) is a rich subject that brings together different domains such as general relativity , field theory , astrophysics and cosmology . at present various gravitational - wave detectors , after decades of developments",
    ", have reached a sensitivity where there are significant chances of detection , and future improvements are expected to lead , in a few years , to advanced detectors with even better sensitivities @xcite .",
    "there are good reasons to expect that the universe is permeated also by a stochastic background of gw generated in the early universe .",
    "in particular , the fossil gw becoming from the big - bang should be a great success if it were detected .",
    "recently has been reported gw produced during the inflationary epoch@xcite which are compatible with a energy scale of @xmath0 . however , more data are required to confirm the above situation . during the inflationary expansion ,",
    "the universe suffered an exponential accelerated expansion driven by a scalar ( inflaton ) field with an equation of state close to a vacuum dominated one@xcite .",
    "the most conservative assumption is that the energy density @xmath1 is due to a cosmological parameter which is constant and the equation of state is given by a constant @xmath2 , describing a vacuum dominated universe with pressure @xmath3 and energy density @xmath4 .",
    "inflationary cosmology can be recovered from a 5d vacuum@xcite , and is very consistent with current observations of the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb)@xcite . the most popular model of supercooled inflation is chaotic inflation@xcite , but there are many models which are good candidates . in this model",
    "the expansion of the universe is driven by a single scalar field called inflaton . at some initial epoch ,",
    "presumably the planck scale , the scalar field is roughly homogeneous and dominates the energy density , which remains almost constant during all the inflationary epoch .",
    "it is well known that the inflationary cosmology also generates a background of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "dark energy cosmological scenarios have been intensively studied in the last years@xcite .",
    "the scenarios there described can explain the generation of gravitational waves on cosmological , but not on astrophysical scales .",
    "during inflation the energy scales are of the order of @xmath5 , but it is expected that can exist an earlier epoch of the universe in which it begins to increase until becoming in a de sitter expansion . in this epoch",
    "the energy scales in the universe should be bigger , of the order of @xmath6 , which is the planckian order of energy .",
    "such epoch is called pre - inflation and is necesary to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe known as inflation , which is very important because solves many cosmological problems such as , for example , can explain the flatness , isotropy and homogeneity of the present day universe such as can explain the nonexistence of magnetic monopoles .",
    "of course all these predictions are only valid on cosmological scales which actually are in the range @xmath7 .",
    "inflation is also very important because is capable to explain the genesis of primordial structure formation in the universe , which is later makes possible the galactic formation . when the inhomogeneities of the scale factor which driven inflation are unstable their modes cross the causal horizon which is related to the cosmological constant @xmath8 .",
    "after inflation , when matter acquire mass these modes re - enter the horizon and become causally connected again .",
    "during inflation the size of the horizon was of the order of @xmath9 . ] , but at present is really very small : @xmath10 .",
