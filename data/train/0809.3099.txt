    "low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbgs ) are galaxies that emit much less light per area than normal galaxies . yet , owing to their faintness compared with the night sky , they are hard to find .",
    "hence their contribution to the local galaxy population has been underestimated for a long time .",

    "the first quantitative suggestion about lsbgs is the so - called freeman s law .",
    "it was noticed by freeman ( 1970 ) that the central surface brightness of 28 out of 36 disk galaxies fell in the range of @xmath1=21.65@xmath70.3 mag  arcsec@xmath4 .",

    "the first one was based on the second palomar sky survey ( poss - ii , schombert and bothun 1988 ; schombert et al .",
    "a second one was initiated in the fornax cluster using the malinization technique in order to compare the results to virgo ( bothun et al .",

    "the third one used the automated plate measuring ( apm ) to scan uk schmidt plates using an algorithm optimized to find lsb galaxies .",

    "; mcgaugh @xmath6 de blok 1997 ) and large amounts of dark matter ( de blok @xmath6 mcgaugh 1997 ) . despite these impressive progresses , there are still several challenges about lsbgs , such as many aspects of their formation and evolution , in particular , considerable uncertainty regarding their star formation history and so on . moreover , the previous studies were based on small samples , up to about several hundreds , while the present modern digital sky surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , greatly improved the observed numbers of astronomical objects , and could provide a much larger sample of lsbgs , hence giving much more information .",
    "therefore , we propose a project to search for a large sample of lsbgs from the sdss database , and then to study their properties in detail .    in this first paper of our series about the large sample of lsbgs selected from the sdss",
    ", we will present how to select the sample and then show their basic properties and stellar populations from photometric colors .",

    "the completeness for objects with spectroscopy observations is high , exceeding 99% , and the fraction of galaxies eliminated by surface brightness cut is very small ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the only significant source of incompleteness identified is bending with saturated stars , which is higher for higher brightness because they subtend more sky ( strauss et al .",
    "relative to all the sdss targets , the sdss spectroscopic survey is 90% complete ( blanton et al .",

    ". it does lead to a slight underrepresentation of high - density regions ( hogg et al .",
    "2004 ) , however , where bright early - type galaxies usually dominate . additionally , there are a small faction of redshift failures ( @xmath22 ) and some bright star contamination ( @xmath23 ) that becomes more significant for brighter galaxies ( strauss et al .",
    "2002 ; mcintosh et al .",
    "however , the completeness of the sample at the low surface brightness end needs to be discussed carefully because of the known problem of surface brightness limit in a redshift survey and the focus of our work on the low surface brightness ones . we will specially discuss this incompleteness in sect .",
    "[ sec.55 ] and will extract a volume - limited sub - sample , which is complete , from our whole sample galaxies to check what changes appearing in the related properties of the galaxies .",
    "we prefer to use the dr4 rather than the latest dr6 here .",
    "that is because dr4 has been large enough for statistical analysis of lsbgs ; other property parameters for galaxies in dr4 have also been obtained by the mpa / jhu group , such as the emission - line measurements etc . ; and the nyu - vagc catalog ( blanton et al . 2005 ) has made some useful cross correlations with other survey databases .",
    "these can provide us more information on both photometry and spectroscopy .",
