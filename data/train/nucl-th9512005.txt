    "one of the still most challenging questions in nuclear physics is that of the equation of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter @xcite . to investigate the properties of nuclear matter at high densities and temperatures ,",
    "heavy ion collisions are of great importance , and various experiments are conducted for that purpose .",
    "the simulation of such collisions however is equivalent to solving a quantum - mechanical many - body problem , which to date is not fully possible .",
    "different approaches have been made to nevertheless approximate the solution .",
    "one method is that of molecular dynamics ( see for example @xcite ) , in this method both the long - range attractive ( soft ) and the short - range repulsive ( hard ) part of the particle interaction is parametrized by potentials , the trajectories are continously updated in response to the local potential .",
    "another semi - classical particle - based method is the buu approach . here",
    "the soft part of the interaction is represented by mean fields , while the hard part is given by an explicit collision term .",
    "the collision term itself can again be represented in different ways , especially the criteria for a collision to happen are model dependent . in many codes , this decision is based on geometrical considerations , for example , a collision is generated at the point of closest approach between two particles ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "one particular implementation of the collision term in buu codes is the direct simulation monte carlo approach ( dsmc ) , see for example lang .",
    "@xcite , and danielewicz @xcite . in this approach",
    ", collisions are not generated through geometrical and particle - trajectory based criteria , but stochastically in a way that the correct collision rate is reproduced . in a collision only momenta and energy of the particles are changed , while the particles themselves stay in place until the next advection step  the particles are assumed to be pointlike .",
    "it was suggested that in order to reproduce a hard - sphere boltzmann equation , the dsmc approach should be extended by an additional advection that should take place after any collision @xcite , and by a modification the collision probability itself @xcite .",
    "this advection is supposed to push the collision partners away from each other according to their hard - sphere radius , and the collision probability is adjusted to take into account the excluded volume of the hard spheres and screening effects . the modified dsmc method is called consistent boltzmann algorithm ( cba ) .    in this paper",
    "we study the effect of those modifications on the nuclear flow . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we describe the theoretical background of our calculations , and section [ sec3 ] presents our results and conclusions .",
    "in the dsmc approach , the positions and momenta of the particles are evolved in a two - step process , namely advection and collisions , corresponding to one timestep of the simulation . during the advection",
    "step the particles are propagated according to their momenta . during the collision step",
    "first the particles are sorted into spatial cells of volume @xmath0 .",
    "then out of the @xmath1 particles within a given box , at random , @xmath2 combinations are chosen and scattered with the probability @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the energy - dependent elementary hadron - hadron cross section , @xmath5 is the number of testparticles representing one nucleon in a full - ensemble testparticle algorithm @xcite , @xmath6 is the timestep length , and @xmath7 is the relative velocity of the particle pair @xcite . in the limit @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , the solutions of this method",
    "have been shown to converge to the exact solution of the boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "this approach does not take into account the finite size of the nucleons ; the testparticles are point - like , and if it was not for the contribution of the mean field , they would be following an ideal gas equation of state .",
    "it has therefore been suggested by alexander et al .",
    "@xcite to include an extra displacement @xmath11 of the collisions partners , @xmath12 @xmath13 being the velocity difference before , and @xmath14 being the velocity difference after the collision .",
    "particle 1 is displaced by @xmath11 and particle 2 by @xmath15@xmath11 .",
    "this additional advection pushes the nucleons apart according to their hard - sphere radius .",
    "it is not obvious right away how this displacement scales with @xmath5 .",
    "however , as in the mean free path @xmath16 of a testparticle , @xmath17 being the nuclear density , there is no @xmath5 dependence , the average number of collisions that a certain testparticle is involved in is independent of @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , in order to achieve the same total displacement during the course of the simulation , the individual displacement per collision should not depend on @xmath5 either .",
    "the testparticles are therefore pushed apart according to the nucleonic radius , and not according to the effective testparticle radius .",
    "the finite radius of the particles also makes it impossible for one particle to be within the `` spheres of influence '' of the others , and thereby from the available volume @xmath0 a fraction @xmath18 is occupied , where @xmath19 is the average radius of the `` sphere of influence '' of one nucleon , and @xmath20 is the number of nucleons in the respective box .",
    "we obtain @xmath19 by randomly picking @xmath1 particle combinations for a respective box and calculating their cross sections @xmath21 .",
    "the pauli principle is approximately taken into account by only choosing particle combinations with partners that are not from the same nucleus , unless at least one of them had scattered before , and for the remaining combinations taking into account the reduced phase space volume . with @xmath22 being the momentum of the beam per nucleon , and @xmath23 being the fermi momentum",
    ", we obtain for @xmath19 in this approximation @xmath24 for small @xmath25 , this effective radius is about 0.84 fm , in the range between 100 - 400 mev it is about 0.47 fm .",
    "this is slightly larger than what has recently been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , there , the effective radius derived from delays in elementary processes is about 0.6 - 0.8 fm and 0.15 - 0.3 fm , respectively .    due to the reduced volume @xmath26 alone",
    ", a modified higher scattering probability @xmath27 has to be used .",
    "however , the scattering probability is lowered again by another effect : the particles are screening each other .",
    "a particle might not be available for scattering with another particle because there might be a third particle in between .",
    "it can be shown @xcite , that including this effect leads to a reduction of the scattering probability by a factor of @xmath28 again , the product @xmath29 is independent of the number of testparticles per nucleon @xmath5 . including this factor , the modified scattering probability is @xmath30 where @xmath31 @xmath32 being the second virial coefficient as yielded by the enskog theory of the dense hard - spheres fluid @xcite",
    "; see figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the implementation of the modifications makes the second virial of the hard part of the interaction non - vanishing ; @xmath32 is positive and therefore leads to an increase in preasure .",
    "this is partly compensated by the negative virial @xmath33 that is due to the soft ( mean field ) part of the interaction ; see for example @xcite .",
    "the equation of state deviates from that of an ideal gas by both contributions , i.e. , @xmath34 one should note at this point that the enskog theory is non - relativistic ; both the advection vector @xmath11 and the excluded volume , therefore also @xmath35 , are calculated in a frame - dependent way .",
    "our numerical calculation is based on the msu buu - code by bauer et al .",
    "@xcite which was modified from a geometrical formulation of the collision term to a stochastic formulation according to ref .",
    "only @xmath36 collisions were taken into account , which for the energies considered turned out to be a justified approximation . a full - ensemble and a parallel - ensemble implementation proved to have similar results ; results for different systems were compared with both refs .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite ; they were found in satisfactory agreement .",
    "an interesting side - result at this stage however was that changing the algorithm from geometrical to stochastic scattering increased the frame - of - reference dependence of the result : when running the simulation within the lab - frame we found an asymmetry in the flow which we attribute to the fact that in this frame the projectile is lorentz - contracted and the target is not .",
    "therefore within a spatial box inside of the overlap - zone of the two nuclei there are many more testparticles originating from the projectile than from the target , resulting in an asymmetry of the respective scattering rates .",
    "we are currently trying to overcome this problem by @xmath37-dependent modifications of the scattering probabilities , however , so far with only little success .",
    "the flow - asymmetry vanishes when the calculation is performed in the c.m .- frame , which is what we did in this work .",
    "the geometry - based code did not appear to be sensitive to this asymmetry , however , lorentz invariance certainly still is an issue @xcite .",
    "finally the full - ensemble version of the stochastic code was modified according to ref .",
    "@xcite , and the scaling of the collision rate and the flow with the number of testparticles @xmath5 was checked .",
    "we simulated an ( au , au)-collision at projectile energies of 250 and 400 mev , and @xmath38 fm over a total time of 70 fm/@xmath39 .",
    "the timestep length was 0.1 fm/@xmath39 , the volume @xmath0 was approximately 1.8 @xmath40 , the number of testparticles per nucleon @xmath5 was 250 , @xmath2 in equation ( [ ws ] ) was chosen to be @xmath41 , and we used a soft momentum - dependent equation of state .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the evolution of the configuration in the reaction plane , plotted is the nuclear density @xmath42 .",
    "the result for the unmodified algorithm is shown on the left , the result for the modified algorithm on the right , respectively .",
    "as expected , the nuclei disintegrate slightly more violently due to the additional advection , resulting in a lower nuclear density . a calculation with the additional advection alone revealed that therefore also the collision rate decreases .",
    "however , this is partly compensated by the modified scattering probability eq .",
    ". on the other hand , a calculation with the modified scattering probability alone shows a strongly enhanced collision rate , as expected .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig3 ] illustrates this for the 250 mev collision , the lower panel shows the collision rates for the 400 mev collision .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the average final transverse momentum versus the reduced rapidity as an indicator for nuclear flow . from the slope at zero transverse",
    "momentum one concludes that in this specific simulation the flow increases by approximately 16% for the 250 mev collision , and 5% for the 400 mev collision , with the introduction of the new algorithm . introducing only the additional advection ,",
    "as already pointed out , the collision rate slightly decreases , however , the nuclear flow increases by about 8% for the 250 mev collision . with the introduction of the modified scattering probability alone , the flow increases by about 13% .",
    "the fact that the contributions from both modifications do not `` add up '' indicates that a perturbative approach to their representation would not be justified .",
    "an impact parameter averaged analysis for 250 mev collisions with @xmath43 fm resulted in approximately 132 mev/(@xmath44unit of reduced rapidity ) nuclear flow for the unmodified , and 148 mev/(@xmath44unit of reduced rapidity ) for the modified algorithm ( 12% increase ) .",
    "the plastic ball data indicate approximately 130 mev/(@xmath44unit of red . rap . )",
    "@xcite nuclear flow , the eos data only 119 mev/(@xmath44unit of red . rap . )",
    "@xcite . for 400 mev collisions the same calculations resulted in in approximately 166 mev/(@xmath44unit of red . rap . )",
    "nuclear flow for the unmodified , and 185 mev/(@xmath44unit of red . rap . ) for the modified algorithm ( 11% increase ; plastic ball : @xmath45 169 mev/ ( @xmath44unit of red . rap . ) @xcite ; eos : @xmath45 151 mev/(@xmath44unit of red . rap . )",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "overall we found the effect of the additional advection and the modified scattering probability to be significant , but not crucial .",
    "their implementation moves the outcome of the simulations away from the experimental results .",
    "this indicates the need for an in - medium reduction of the @xmath36 cross section .",
    "this type of reduction was first found to be needed in studies of the disappearance of flow @xcite and later also in theoretical studies based on thermodynamic @xmath46-matrix theory at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "these results were obtained by algorithm with closest approach techniques .",
    "if one wishes to address the question of the nuclear equation of state with a dsmc algorithm , however , the corrections discussed in the present paper should be taken into account .",
