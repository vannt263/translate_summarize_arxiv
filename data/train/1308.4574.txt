    "most stellar mass black hole binaries ( bhbs ) show common behaviour patterns centered around a few states of accretion .",
    "the different accretion states are signified by different spectral energy distributions ( among other things ) having varying degree of contribution from the accretion disk and the non - thermal powerlaw components .",
    "in addition , since _",
    "chandra _ and xmm - newton , there has been increased interest in winds from the accretion disk , as a result of detections of blueshifted absorption lines of varying velocities and temperatures , seen in high resolution x - ray spectra . in order to get a consolidated picture of these systems ,",
    "it is necessary to understand the relation between the accretion states of the bhbs and the properties of the accretion disk winds .",
    "hetgs ( high energy transmission grating spectrometer , @xcite ) sensitive 0.5 - 7.5 kev energy range is rich in atomic transitions .",
    "yet often absorption lines from only h- and he - like fe are detected ( e.g @xcite , @xcite for grs 1915 + 105 , @xcite for gx 339 - 4 , @xcite for h1743 - 322 and @xcite for igr j17091 - 3624 ) .",
    "on the other hand in some rare cases a range of ions is seen , from o through fe ( e.g. @xcite for grs 1915 + 105 , @xcite for gro j165540 ) .",
    "this suggests that the wind properties , e.g. temperature and density , may vary depending on the source and/or the accretion state . in this paper we restrict our discussion to low mass bhbs to ensure that wind signatures originate from the accretion disk rather than from the stellar companion ( as in the case of high mass x - ray binaries ) .",
    "however , we note that accretion disk winds are detected in neutron star binary systems as well ( e.g @xcite , @xcite for cir x-1 , @xcite for gx 13 + 1 , @xcite for 1a0535 + 262 and @xcite for igr j17480 - 2446 ) and that some high mass x - ray binaries ( where the companion to the compact object is a high mass star ) exhibit stellar winds diagnosed through emission ( e.g. vela x-1 , @xcite ; lmc x-4 , @xcite ) or absorption ( e.g. cyg x-1 , @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray studies of bhbs show that winds are not present in all states .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the equivalent width of the fe xxvi absorption line is anti - correlated with the fractional hard power law contribution to the spectrum in grs 1915 + 105 : the softer the state , the more prominent the absorption lines ; see also @xcite . recently",
    "a confirmation of this finding came from the @xcite compilation of wind results ( by the aforementioned and other authors ) verifying the state dependent nature of accretion disk winds in general .",
    "as an explanation for the observed changes in these winds , authors have commonly invoked differences in photoionizing flux ( e.g. * ? ? ? * for h1743 - 322 ) . however , since the properties of winds are also a result of their driving mechanisms @xcite , observed wind variations may also indicate changes in these driving mechanisms .",
    "for example , a well known _",
    "observation of gro j165540 @xcite , showing a rich absorption line spectrum with ions from oviii to nixxvi .",
    "@xcite argue in favour of the magnetic driving mechanism for the wind . but a _ chandra _ observation from 3 weeks earlier , for the same object , shows only fe xxvi absorption @xcite .",
    "the changes can not be explained by changes in the photoionizing flux alone , and @xcite suggest that variable thermal pressure and magnetic fields may both be important in driving long - term changes in this wind .",
    "interestingly while changes in the photoionizing flux , in the driving mechanisms and in the wind density are frequently invoked to explain the observed wind behaviour , the thermodynamic stability of these outflows its relevance to the detectability of particular ions in bhbs have never been discussed in detail .",
    "although quite commonly used for assessing winds in active galactic nuclei @xcite , thermodynamic stability arguments have not been used much to explain observed bhb wind behaviour .",
    "( however , see @xcite for a specific use of the stability curves for determining accretion disk atmosphere properties for neutron star binaries . )",
    "using thermal equilibrium curves , in this paper we test the importance of thermodynamic stability for the observable properties of winds in different accretion states of bhbs .",
    "we are particularly interested in testing if the prevalence of the winds in the softer states ( as noted by * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) can be explained using thermodynamic stability arguments .",
    "we begin our considerations by adopting appropriate spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for different bhb states .",
    "the sed of bhbs usually contains , to varying degrees , ( 1 ) a thermal component conventionally modeled with a multi - temperature blackbody originating from the inner accretion disk and often showing a characteristic temperature ( @xmath2 ) near 1 kev and ( 2 ) a non thermal power - law component with a photon spectrum @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the thermal state is dominated by the radiation from the inner accretion disk contributing more than 75% of the 2 - 20 kev flux ( e.g. dashed red line on top panel of ) .",
    "in contrast the hard power law state ( a.k.a .",
    "hard state ; solid black line in ) is dominated by a flat power law component ( @xmath4 ) that contributes more than 80% of the 2 - 20 kev flux . for any given bhb",
    ", the accretion disk usually appears to be fainter and cooler in this hard power law state than it is in the thermal state .",
    "the radiation from a thin accretion disk may be modeled as the sum of local blackbodies emitted at different radii .",

    "the thermodynamic stability of the photoionized gas is determined by the balance of the major heating and cooling mechanisms along the curves ( see for an example list of such agents , varying with @xmath1 ) .",
    "we expect that if the photoionized gas ( as diagnosed through observed absorption lines ) is detected , its ionization parameter is such that the gas is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "hence the @xmath50 point of such gas should lie on the stable parts of the stability curve .",

    "the ions associated with such gas are therefore unobservable .",
    "in contrast , during the intermediate and thermal states , we find that the ionized gas is thermodynamically stable throughout @xmath54 , and thus a range of ions from low to high z ( atomic number ) elements can be detected in these states . all else being equal ( e.g. luminosity , density of the gas , and its distance from the central source ) , detections of ionized winds should be much more common in thermal and intermediate states .",
    "our predictions of the thermodynamic properties of winds in bhb are consistent with the observations that winds are detected in softer , more thermal states and are rarely detected in spectrally hard states ( here represented by hpl , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in we compare the major heating and cooling agents affecting the different bhb state stability curves in an effort to understand what causes the gas ionized by the hpl sed to become unstable at @xmath55 . as can be seen , at @xmath56 ,",
    "compton heating is far more dominant for the hpl sed ionized gas ( 79% ) than for the thermal sed ionized gas .",
    "this affects the temperature , which is higher , due to comptonization in the former case , and renders the hpl equilibrium curve unstable in the aforementioned @xmath1 range .",
    "note that for the calculations in we have used a gas with constant density @xmath57 .",
    "however , we tested the effect of varying the densities between @xmath58 in and find that the stability curves are _ insensitive _ to density variations for @xmath59 , leaving the above mentioned results for the range @xmath53 for the hpl state , unchanged .",
    "the photoionization calculations performed in this paper are conducted in the static limit . in assessing the relevance of our conclusions for observed ionic differences between bhb states ,",
    "we calculate the thermal cooling time scale @xmath60 ( defined as the time in which the gas looses half of the heat gained by it ; ) of the gas in the static limit . while calculating @xmath60 cloudy considers all the heating and cooling processes associated with static gas ( some of which are detailed in ) . the static gas assumption is reasonable if @xmath60 is less than the adiabatic cooling time scale @xmath61 ( @xmath62^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the acceleration , wind velocity , and radius respectively , @xmath66 being the boltzmann constant ) .",
    "calculation of the adiabatic or dynamical time scale is beyond the scope of this paper ( but see @xcite for example discussions related to the dynamics of outflowing gas in agn and x - ray binaries ) .",
    "we do not make any assumptions about the dynamics or the launching mechanisms of the gas .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the thermodynamics of the photoionized gas , for which we have assumed that the static limit requirements are met .      in this section",
    "we further investigate the range @xmath53 in terms of ion fractions , to assess thermodynamic instability effects on ion observability .",
    "in we plot the @xmath67 distribution of the ion fractions of the he - like and h - like ions of all the elements from zinc ( atomic no .",
    "z = 30 ) to oxygen ( z = 8) .",
    "vertical lines mark thermodynamically unstable range of @xmath67 based on our hpl ionizing sed .    for a given ion",
    "if a significant part of the hpl state ion fraction distribution falls within the unstable @xmath53 range , absorption lines of that ion would not be detected .",
    "thus , during the hpl state a number of important he- and h - like species ( including fexxv ) are essentially ` shrouded ' by the thermodynamically unstable @xmath1 range .",
    "purely from the thermodynamic point of view , these species are not expected to be visible during spectrally hard states .",
    "it is notable , however , that the peak ion fraction for fexxvi ( and higher z h - like ions ) falls outside the unstable @xmath1 range . in other words , if there is a wind in a spectrally hard state with sufficiently high ionization ( @xmath68 ) , it could still be detected in fexxvi absorption .",
    "the unstable @xmath53 range does not apply to the thermal / intermediate states , since there is no thermal instability .",
    "as can be seen from , all ions should be observable from a thermodynamic stability point of view .",
    "these results agree nicely with observational results on the long - term variability of winds .",
    "as discussed above , winds are commonly detected through fexxv and fexxvi absorption during spectrally soft states , and rarely detected during harder states .",
    "there are a small number of exceptions , however .",
    "for example , in a 2005 _ chandra _ hetgs observation of groj1655 during a spectrally hard state , a single fexxvi absorption line was seen @xcite . @xcite explicitly note the absence of arxviii , sxv , and sixiv in that state . by our calculations ,",
    "the absence of these ions is not surprising , given that the required @xmath1 for the gas producing these ions would have fallen within the thermodynamically unstable @xmath1 range .",
    "the fiducial seds discussed in and shown in , although generic representations of the respective states , were generated using certain sed parameters . in this section we investigate the effects of varying sed parameters - @xmath69 ( ) , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( ) and powerlaw break @xmath38 ( ) on thermodynamic stability results . we find that physically and observationally reasonable variations of these parameters do not alter the conclusions of our thermodynamic calculations ( ) . the same is true for variations in the wind density ( )        a plausible range of black hole masses lie between @xmath70 ( e.g. xte j1650500 @xcite ) and @xmath71 ( e.g see @xcite for grs 1915 - 105 , @xcite for m 33 x-7 and @xcite for cygnus x-1 ) . as discussed in ,",
    "we choose a black hole of mass @xmath72 ( based on groj1655 ) to represent a generic bhb .",
    "we further chose particular sets of @xmath73 and @xmath74 that correspond to values of @xmath26 and @xmath75 typically observed in outbursts of bhbs .    given the relationship between temperature , disk radius , accretion rate , and black hole mass ( ) , how much are the seds affected by variations in @xmath7 ? in , we have compared the relationship between @xmath26 and @xmath75 for a @xmath23 black hole to that of a @xmath76 and a @xmath77 black hole .",
    "the fiducial values for our three seds are marked as solid black stars .",
    "the top panel of shows that for reasonable accretion rates and inner disk radii , our thermal / hpl seds could apply to a @xmath76 black hole ; the intermediate sed requires higher accretion rates ( @xmath78 ) , but not unheard of in bhbs .",
    "the @xmath77 black hole can also match the fiducial values of @xmath26 with reasonable values of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , although the implied disk normalizations are a factor of @xmath79 larger .",
    "thus we believe that our seds can be considered broadly representative of bhbs at a range of masses , accretion rates , and disk radii .",
    "as discussed , we have followed the scheme of @xcite to pick reasonable combinations for accretion disk and power law components ( see ) .",
    "since our stability curves are dependent on overall spectral shape , it is imperative to test if our results ( derived from the stability curves ) are robust to variations in @xmath40 and @xmath41    @xcite define the thermal state as having @xmath81 . keeping our @xmath41 constant at 2.5",
    ", we calculated new stability curves for @xmath82 , and found no changes in the thermodynamic stability of the gas . since @xcite do not state a particular range for @xmath41 , we vary @xmath83 ( in steps of 0.2 ) keeping @xmath29 constant .",
    "for @xmath84 the curve becomes unstable in the range @xmath85 .",
    "however , a literature survey reveals no instances of @xmath86 in the thermal state .",
    "hence we conclude that during the thermal state , winds should be thermodynamically stable for all values of @xmath1 .    in addition",
    "@xcite define the spectrally hard state ( which we call the hpl state ) as having @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "varying @xmath89 while keeping @xmath34 constant and then varying @xmath90 ( in steps of 0.2 ) while keeping @xmath91 constant we find that the curve retains the unstable @xmath1 range discussed in .",
    "thus the qualitative results presented in hold for the entire range of the parameters of x - ray emission defined by @xcite for the bhb states .      for all the seds discussed in the previous sections , the parameters for the exponential cut - off in the powerlaw ( ) were chosen such that the powerlaw had a break at @xmath92 .",
    "observations of spectrally hard ( hpl ) states of bhbs show powerlaw breaks at @xmath92 , but for thermal states the break is usually observed at much lower energies @xmath93 .",
    "it is believed that this has to do with the presence or absence of jets ( and associated particle acceleration processes ) in these states .",
    "regardless of the origin of changes in the break energy , though , the effect on thermodynamic conditions is worth investigating , so we calculated new stability curves for @xmath94 , both for the thermal and hpl states .    based on our analysis , the stability curves are insensitive to the variation in @xmath38 for @xmath95 ( k ) or @xmath96 . at higher temperatures ,",
    "the stability curves become more smooth and the plasma actually becomes more stable as the break energy decreases from 100 kev to 20 kev .",
    "this does not affect our conclusions for the thermal state , since the plasma was already stable at all @xmath1 .    however , one consequence of variations in @xmath38 is that during the hpl state , the aforementioned range @xmath53 becomes thermodynamically stable ( see ) as @xmath38 is decreased to 20 kev .",
    "the theoretical reason for this effect is easy to understand , where one recalls the discussion on heating and cooling agents in . according to , at high ionization parameters ( @xmath97 , the temperature of the gas ionized by hpl sed is determined by compton heating ( 79% contribution ) when @xmath98 .",
    "however , if @xmath99 , then there is a significant decrease in the number of high energy photons thus reducing the extent of comptonization ( comptonization contributes only 49% to heating ) .",
    "hence the temperature of the gas decreases resulting in a thermodynamically stable distribution of temperature and pressure .",
    "although theoretically noteworthy , this is not a relevant result because the jet dominated hpl state is not likely to have such low break in the powerlaw .",
    "thus , variation in the powerlaw break @xmath38 also does not affect the results in , unless there are reasons to consider that the hpl state continuum has a low powerlaw break at @xmath100 .",
    "we vary the particle density of the absorbing gas between @xmath101 and generate stability curves ( ) for the hpl state ( left panel ) , the thermal state ( middle panel ) and the intermediate state ( right panel ) seds , to determine if the results presented in are susceptible to density effects . as can be seen from the figure ,",
    "density variations do not have any effect on the stability curves for @xmath59 and the effect is small until @xmath102 . for lower @xmath67",
    "the stability curves are seen to be thermodynamically unstable if the wind has density @xmath103 . because the vast majority of plasma in bhbs can be described by ionization parameters @xmath104 ( with the exception of gx 339 - 4 , @xmath105 ; @xcite ) , our conclusions for the thermodynamic stability ( or lack of it ) of winds are not affected by gas density variations .",
    "even though we primarily see high @xmath106 gas in bhbs , we still consider density effects at low @xmath107 to improve theoretical understanding",
    ". shows that the greatest difference in the gas temperature occurs at @xmath108 in comparing plasma with @xmath109 to one with @xmath110 . referring back to we find the detailed heating and cooling agents corresponding to the different stability curves .",
    "specifically , comparing the results for @xmath111 in , the heating and cooling agents and their fractional contributions are similar for @xmath112 but differ from that of @xmath51 .",
    "an explanation is that - line cooling is dominant for @xmath109 , whereas continuum processes like free - free cooling , recombination cooling and radiation through emission of iso - sequences of hydrogen and helium are dominant cooling mechanisms for @xmath51 resulting in higher temperatures in the later case .",
    "we have constructed fiducial seds for the thermal , intermediate and hpl states of the bhbs , following the prescription of @xcite for a typical @xmath113 black hole , based on groj1655 . using these seds we generated thermodynamic stability curves for each state to arrive at the following conclusions :    1 .   in the thermal and intermediate state",
    "all phases of the wind is _ thermodynamically stable _ (  ) .",
    "however , the ionization parameter range @xmath53 is _ thermodynamically unstable _ for winds in the hpl state .",
    "we found that a large number of the he - like ions ( 21 @xmath114 z @xmath114 30 , ti through cu ) and h - like ions ( 15 @xmath114 z @xmath114 25 , s through mn ) have peak ion fractions in the unstable ionization parameter range for the hpl state , making the lines from these ions potentially unobservable (  ) .",
    "our findings are well corroborated in the observational literature , since there appears to be a gradient in wind properties with bhb state . in accord with their thermodynamic stability ( and lack of it for",
    "spectrally harder hpl states ) , winds are predominantly observed in intermediate and soft / thermal states and have weak or absent lines from fexxv and low - z elements in the hpl states @xcite . in the hpl state , while the ions with peak ion fractions in the unstable @xmath1 range may be unobservable , fexxvi may remain detectable at high ionization parameters ( @xmath115 ) in such states ( based on our calculations in and consistent with observations noted by @xcite ) .",
    "3 .   in general ,",
    "a range of ionizations are thermodynamically stable ( except for @xmath53 for hpl state ) in all the states we have studied here . yet the observed absorbers are usually consistent with a single high ionization parameter .",
    "this may indicate a genuine absence of plasma at lower ionization . on the other hand , for many other sources intervening cold absorption from the source or the ism may be the reason .",
    "there have been suggestions for magnetically driven winds in e.g groj1655 @xcite .",
