    "if a liquid is cooled and crystallization is avoided , one obtains a supercooled liquid . upon further cooling",
    "the system falls out of equilibrium and results in a glass . during the transition from liquid to supercooled liquid to glass the thermodynamic properties change and even more drastic changes occur in the dynamics @xcite .",
    "the viscosity increases by many orders of magnitude upon cooling and the mean square displacement ( msd ) as a function of time develops a plateau at intermediate times .",
    "the lower the temperature the longer the waiting time within the plateau until a second rise in the mean square displacement occurs @xcite .",
    "one common explanation for the plateau is that while at high temperatures one has ( at late enough times ) normal diffusion , at lower temperatures particles are caged in , i.e. trapped by their neighbors , and spend longer time within this cage with decreasing temperatures .",
    "the second increase in the msd indicates that after long enough waiting time the particles manage to escape their cage .",
    "this escape out of the cage ( `` jump '' ) is the focus of this paper .    to set the work of this paper in context , we review briefly previous studies on the dynamics of supercooled liquids and glasses .",
    "we restrict ourselves mostly to simple glass formers , excluding major work about strong glass formers , ionic systems , polymers and crystals .",
    "central quantities in both * experiments and computer simulations * are the viscosity , diffusion constant and msd .",
    "the msd , which is an average over single particle @xmath0 displacements , @xmath1 and variations thereof @xcite @xmath2 show jumps when viewed with fine enough time resolution , and when studied at low enough temperatures and for single configurations @xcite .",
    "detailed studies of these jumps indicate collective motion @xcite .",
    "one learns about the interplay between regular diffusion and hopping motion via four - point correlation functions @xcite and the van hove correlation function @xmath3 @xcite where @xmath4 is the self part and @xmath5 is the distinct part .",
    "the hopping shows up in an additional peak in @xmath4 and an increase in the amplitude at @xmath6 of @xmath5 .",
    "recently attention has been drawn to the non - gaussian tail of @xmath7 @xcite and the non - gaussian parameter @xmath8 @xcite which is the second coefficient of the cumulant series of @xmath9 , the fourier transform of @xmath4 .",
    "they are signatures of non - exponential behavior , which might be either due to homogeneous complex dynamics and/or due to spatially heterogeneous dynamics @xcite . this has been studied both with experiments @xcite and in simulations of two - dimensional @xcite and three - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "studies of the most mobile particles reveal that they move increasingly more collectively with decreasing temperature",
    ". one distinct feature of this collective dynamics is that some particles are moving along a string @xcite .",
    "similar motion has been found via the study of normal modes which are commonly used to study the dynamics at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of glasses out of equilibrium , i.e. systems which have been quenched from high to low temperature , displays additional complexity , since the system might `` age '' @xcite .",
    "this means that the dynamics depends on the waiting time between the quench and the measurement @xcite which results in the violation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem @xcite .",
    "another fruitful approach to gain insight into the dynamics of supercooled liquids and glasses has been to investigate the energy landscape of the inherent structure , that means of the instantaneous configurations which have been quenched to their local potential energy minimum @xcite . at the same temperature when the system starts slowing down drastically",
    ", the potential energy of the inherent structure undergoes a qualitative change @xcite .",
    "the long time behavior of this potential energy shows jumps between metabasins , where the latter are groups of strongly correlated local minima @xcite .",
    "the mean average waiting time @xmath10 between these jumps turns out to be dominated by the long times . @xmath10 together with the diffusion constant allow an estimate of the cage size @xcite .",
    "direct studies of the cage have been done via three - time correlations @xcite , velocity - velocity correlations @xcite , via the cage correlation function @xcite , and a passage time before a particle escapes @xcite .",
    "the results of these studies tell us about cage properties such as the cage size and waiting time within a cage ( or jump rate ) .",
    "hand in hand with the experiments and simulations are the * theoretical models * for supercooled liquids and glasses .",
    "one of the very successful theories is the mode coupling theory of the glass transition ( mct ) @xcite , which describes the dynamics of supercooled liquids via non - linear dynamics of coupled density modes and makes predictions for quantities such as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and the susceptibility @xmath13 .",
    "the extended version of mct includes hopping processes via the coupling to current fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the comparison of experiment and this theory for @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite shows very good agreement .",
    "the mct is a theory for the glass transition for temperatures above the glass transition .",
    "below the glass transition there exists no equivalent of a microscopic theory such as mct .",
    "some phenomenological theories which are more general models for solids build in hopping either indirectly as in the free volume model @xcite or directly in hopping models @xcite .",
    "direct hopping models are based on the assumption that hopping is the main process which explains the dynamics .",
    "the starting point in these models is usually a random walk and the anomalous diffusion is incorporated via a distribution of waiting times ( or jump rates ) .",
    "the jumping entities are either defects @xcite , uncharged carriers @xcite or ( in the case of predictions for ac and dc conductivity ) charged carriers @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to obtain via single particle trajectories direct information about jump processes such as jump sizes and waiting times between jumps .",
    "specific examples of the dynamics of single particle jumps , in the form of a plot of one component of @xmath15 @xcite or in the form of a two- or three - dimensional picture of the particle trajectory @xcite , are very helpful to get an idea of some qualitative features of jumps , such as the detailed geometry of jump processes @xcite . in this paper , however , we go beyond single examples by defining a systematic search algorithm for jump processes . for the case of single particle trajectories",
    "a similar approach has been used in the work @xcite , where the jump criterion is a minimum hopping distance , which is the same for all particles .",
    "in contrast , we use a relative criterion , where for each particle its size of fluctuations is compared to its jump size .",
    "we choose this relative criterion to be able to identify jumps of particles of different sizes and neighborhood .",
    "that means the criterion is adjusted to the cage size of each individual particle . as criterion for the occurrence of a jump we use the positions of particles instead of their energy .",
    "while both approaches are fruitful , we believe that many theoretical models and interpretations of simulations and experiments are based on an intuitive picture of the particle motion in real space . similarly our goal is to mimic a careful observer of each particles motion in our system .",
    "we therefore use single particle trajectories , instead of a quantity which is an average over all particles ( as in the work @xcite ) . for the case of single particle trajectories",

    "we truncate and shift the potential at @xmath26 . from previous investigations @xcite it is known that this system is not prone to crystallization and demixing . in the following we will use reduced units where the unit of length is @xmath27 , the unit of energy is @xmath28 and the unit of time is @xmath29 .",
    "we carry out molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations using the velocity verlet algorithm with a time step of 0.02 .",
    "the volume is kept constant at @xmath30 and we use periodic boundary conditions . according to previous simulations @xcite the kinetic glass transition is around @xmath31 .",
    "we analyze here simulations at @xmath32 and @xmath33 as they have been described in @xcite .",
    "we start with 10 independent well equilibrated configurations at @xmath34.@xcite each of these configurations undergoes the following sequence of simulation runs . after an instantaneous quench to @xmath35 we first run a ( nvt ) simulation for @xmath36 md steps . the temperature is kept constant by replacing the velocities of all particles by new velocities drawn from the corresponding boltzmann distribution every 50 time steps .",
    "we then run the simulation for @xmath36 md steps without the temperature bath ( nve ) and subsequently raise the temperature instantaneously to the next higher temperature @xmath37 .",
    "( nvt ) and ( nve ) runs of @xmath36 md steps each follow and the temperature is again raised , and so forth .",
    "the final configurations of these ( nvt ) runs are the initial configurations for the ( nve ) production runs ( for @xmath38 md steps ) presented in this paper . during each production run the positions of all particles ( configurations ) are stored every 2000 md steps which are then used for analysis .    for the here investigated temperatures the relaxation times @xmath39 are much larger than the waiting time before the production runs ( at @xmath40 is @xmath41 ) .",
    "we therefore study relaxation processes out of equilibrium and find aging effects , which is consistent with previous detailed studies of aging of the same binary lennard - jones system @xcite .",
    "we focus in this paper on the process of a particle escaping its cage , using single particle trajectories @xmath15 given by the periodically stored configurations .",

    "we use in specific for @xmath46 not consecutive but instead average positions which are four averages ( each of 20 configurations ) apart .",

    "similar results have been found in previous simulations of other systems @xcite .",
    "however , the present work differs from these that we analyze all following quantities for the reversible and irreversible jumps separately . as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : jumptype ] , we call a jump reversible whenever case  1 or case  2 occurs .",

    "fig : jumptype ] ) the spikes in @xmath15 indicate returns to the average position before the jump @xcite .",
    "if a jump satisfies neither case  1 nor case  2 , then it is called `` irreversible jump . ''    in the following we distinguish between the jump events , as they have been defined so far , and the corresponding jumping particles which may undergo multiple jumps of different types .",
    "any reversible jump designates the corresponding particle as a reversible jumper for the entire time window .",

    "the irreversible jumps lower the energies more than reversible jumps and more so for a than b particles , because a jump of a larger a particle results in a bigger change in environment than for a smaller b - particle .",

    "b particles occur at all temperatures . with increasing temperature more particles jump ,",
    "more average positions are visited , the jump size both in position and in the absolute value of the potential energies @xmath157 and @xmath158 ( total and single - particle , not minimized and minimized ) increase , and the fluctuations in position @xmath159 and potential energy @xmath160 increase .",
    "the fluctuations are larger for jumping particles than for non - jumping particles even if fluctuations during the jump are not part of the average , which indicates that jumping particles are not only during jump times more mobile than non - jumping particles .",
    "the ratio @xmath161 of irreversible jumps decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "this confirms a commonly used assumption that with increasing temperature the irreversible jumps become more driven by fluctuations .    with increasing temperature also irreversible jumps",
    "become proportionally more frequent than reversible jumps .",
    "we interpret this such that irreversible and reversible jumps are similar in that sense that a particle tries to escape its cage . in the case of",
    "reversible jumps the particle finds its way back into the cage whereas in the case of an irreversible jump the path back into the cage becomes blocked due to rearrangements of the cage . at larger temperature these rearrangements of the cage become more likely ( since for example the fluctuations increase ) and therefore irreversible jumps occur more often .",
    "irreversible and reversible jumps show in most quantities qualitatively the same behavior , such as their temperature dependence of jump size in position and energy , and differ only in size .",
    "an exception to this similarity is the distribution of jump sizes , which suggests that there might be an additional jump process in the case of reversible jumps indicated by an additional peak at small jump sizes .",
    "the most surprising result of our work is that the times between successive jumps are independent of temperature .",
    "this is most likely due to aging , which could mean on the time scale of our simulation that @xmath66 reflects the time scale of @xmath40 from which we quenched the system , and that @xmath66 might show temperature dependence at later times .",
    "the latter would be consistent with the work of doliwa _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite who find in their simulations of very long times that the distribution of waiting times ( however , identified via the collective quantity of the minimized potential energy ) initially is temperature independent and of different power law than at later times when temperature dependence occurs .",
    "we do find aging in that sense that the times before the first jump are shorter than the times after the last jump of a particle ( an effect which becomes less for temperatures near @xmath162 ) .",
    "future work ( which is in progress ) will tell us if in our system @xmath66 becomes temperature dependent after longer times .",
    "however , the dynamics does depend on temperature for all other here investigated quantities such as the number of jumps and the fraction of reversible jumps .",
    "another question which we would like to raise for future work is how much single particle jumps can tell us about relaxations of a glass which might include collective motion .",
    "it seems plausible that single particle jumps are strongly correlated with collective jumps and in that sense give us very similar information to studies of collective quantities .",
    "we find that many of the single particle jumps in our system are spatially and temporally correlated , i.e. are showing collective motion .",
    "systematic studies for confirmation remain to be done in the future .",
    "we also find the signature of many - particle effects confirmed in the result of the increasing ratio of irreversible jumps with increasing temperature , since this indicates that not only the jumping particle itself but also its cage are dependent on temperature . there might , however , be also collective jumps , where each particle jumps a too small amount to be detected by our search algorithm .",
    "it remains to be studied of how much importance such processes are in our system .",
