    "one of the generic predictions of inflation lies in the fact that vacuum fluctuations of all light scalar fields , @xmath0 , minimally coupled to gravity and with a mass smaller than the hubble parameter ( @xmath1 ) , are universally unstable and appear after inflation as classical random a priori gaussian inhomogeneities with ( almost ) scale free spectrum @xmath2 .",
    "the wavelengths of the fluctuations , @xmath3 , of such a light scalar field are stretched by inflation and exceed the hubble patch after inflation .",
    "one can relate @xmath3 to the cosmological scalar metric perturbations in different ways , depending on the composition of the underlying theory .",
    "indeed , the simplest and most studied possibility is to assume that there is a single light scalar field that is the inflaton itself , @xmath4 .",
    "the inflaton fluctuations @xmath5 are transferred to the scalar metric perturbations through gravitational interaction  @xcite .    on general grounds",
    ", we may however expect many scalar fields playing roles during inflation .",
    "there is a broad range of multiple fields inflationary models with different motivations behind them , like e.g. double inflation  @xcite or hybrid inflation  @xcite , where different fields dominate at different stages of the cosmological evolution .",
    "multiple fields were also evoked to design departures from the standard inflationary predictions : existence of isocurvature modes  @xcite , non - scale free spectrum of primordial fluctuations  @xcite or deviation from gaussianity  @xcite . in these cases some fields",
    "non - necessarily give dominant contribution to the background evolution , but during some time give dominant contribution to the perturbations .",
    "another corner of the multiple field parameter space is related to the curvaton scenario  @xcite . there , a newly introduced scalar field ,",
    "the curvaton , that is indeed not the inflaton , should be light during inflation , plus dominate after inflaton decay , plus decay after inflaton but prior bbn , plus gives a dominant contribution to the metric fluctuations .    a new and more economic idea to generate cosmological perturbations from modulated fluctuations of couplings",
    "was proposed recently  @xcite . in the context of multiple scalar fields theories ,",
    "it is assumed in these models that some of the light fields never give dominant contribution neither into background nor in perturbations during inflation , but contribute to the coupling constants @xmath6 indeed , in string theory  @xcite couplings are in fact the vev of moduli fields and , in susy theories couplings can also depend on scalars . as a result ,",
    "fluctuations of the moduli @xmath7 generated during inflation , will manifest themselves in spatial inhomogeneities of the couplings @xmath8 the interaction is not as important during inflation as it is after inflation .",
    "consider for example simple chaotic inflation .",
    "the background scalar field rolls towards the minimum of the potential , where it begins to oscillate . due to the coupling to the other fields the inflaton decays into radiation in the process of ( p)reheating  @xcite . because of the large scale coupling inhomogeneities , eq .",
    "( [ coupl1 ] ) , at scales much larger than the causal horizon after inflation , transition from the matter dominated regime of inflaton oscillations to radiation occurs in different causal patches not simultaneously , which leads to small adiabatic metric perturbations after ( p)reheating . after the moduli @xmath0 get pinned down to their minima , the spatial variations of coupling constants in the late time universe will be erased .",
    "however , the large scale metric fluctuations that are produced due to interactions survive as a memory of the primordial moduli inhomogeneities .",
    "it is actually not mandatory for scalar fields to be light during inflation .",
    "in fact , in the context of @xmath9 supergravity with the minimal khler potential during inflation the scalars typically acquire the mass @xmath10 .",
    "cosmological fluctuations neither in inflaton sector nor in moduli sector are produced unless a special care is taken to make at least some of them light .",
    "this , together with the options to built up inflationary models , motivate the study of different mechanisms of generation of cosmological perturbations .    in this article",
    ", we investigate this mechanism of _ modulated cosmological fluctuations_. original papers on the modulated fluctuations @xcite discussed metric perturbations generated from the decay of inflaton oscillations .",

    "typically inflaton oscillations decay through the non - perturbative effect of parametric resonance of particle creation  @xcite .",
    "this leads to copious production of particles in out - of - equilibrium state .",
    "further interactions between particles relax them towards thermal equilibrium .",
    "perturbative regime of particle interactions takes place at the latest stages of transition from inflation towards hot radiation  @xcite . in hybrid inflation , preheating after inflation has the character of the tachyonic preheating  @xcite , accompanying the symmetry breaking after inflation  @xcite .",
    "tachyonic preheating leads to generation of particles out - of - equilibrium with subsequent thermalization of them .",
    "coupling constants of interaction appears at different stages of preheating and thermalization .",
    "however , for the production of modulated cosmological perturbations it is essential that couplings are responsible for the change of the equation of state .",
    "if the equation of state is not changing , modulated perturbations are not generated . in this respect",
    "we shall concentrate at the first instance where equation of state after inflation is changing due to the couplings .",
    "in the case of chaotic inflation it happens when an effective matter equation of state of the coherent inflaton oscillations is replaced by the radiation in the very fast process of preheating . in the case of hybrid inflation ,",
    "the vacuum - like ( inflation ) equation of state is replaced by radiation in the very quick process of tachyonic preheating .",
    "so far the formalism of the modulated cosmological fluctuations was considered for the toy model of slow perturbative reheating @xcite , often with the yukawa type interaction @xmath16 between inflaton and fermions .",
    "this is fair enough to see in principle that metric fluctuations are generated from the moduli inhomogeneities .",
    "however , the modern theory of the transition between inflation and radiation is described by the theory of preheating . even for case of fermions",
    "their production is non - perturbative and significantly modified by preheating @xcite . in this paper , on the technical side , we suggest the method to treat generation of modulated cosmological fluctuations in the inflationary models with preheating .",
    "we will use the fact that in all cases preheating is very short , and from the general relativistic point of view can be considered as the instant jump of the equation of state .",
    "it is then convenient to use the formalism of matching conditions of the geometrical quantities at the time of the transition  @xcite . for this",
    ", we do not need to know the microscopic details of preheating and thermalization .    in section  [ sec_hybrid ] ,",
    "we first discuss the basics of the modulation of the couplings and some model building aspects that have to be fulfilled for such a mechanism to be efficient . after recalling the basics of the matching conditions in section  [ sec - match ] ,",
    "we then apply them to the standard single field inflationary case in section  [ sec_infl ] .",

    "the squares of the effective masses of both fields are positive and the potential has a minimum at @xmath21 . for @xmath22",

    "the symmetry breaking occurs .",
    "recall , however , that immediately after the bifurcation point the field @xmath17 has a negative mass square .",
    "hence , dynamics of the symmetry breaking is accompanying by the tachyonic instability of inhomogeneous modes .",
    "it results in the very rapid decay of the homogeneous fields into inhomogeneous modes in the non - linear regime of tachyonic preheating @xcite much before the global potential minimum is reached . for what we are interested in this bath of inhomogeneous modes",
    "essentially behaves like a radiation fluid . in the following",
    "we will simply assume the transition between inflation and radiation domination to be instantaneous    in general in hybrid models @xmath4 and @xmath17 can be viewed as scalar fields coming from a much larger scalar sector of the theory .",
    "we then assume that there exist a set of light scalar fields , @xmath0 and that the couplings @xmath14 and @xmath26 absorb the dependence on these scalars as @xmath27 @xmath14 , @xmath15 are determined by the vevs of these fields . since the fields @xmath0 are light , they develop super - hubble inhomogeneities so that the symmetry breaking that terminates the inflationary stage does not occur at the same time everywhere and is modulated over space .",
    "the fluctuations of the light fields modulate the couplings @xmath14 and @xmath15 which then have spatial fluctuations in a way that depends on their dependence on the @xmath0 vevs , @xmath28 it follows that our model consists of the inflaton , @xmath4 , a higgs - like field , @xmath17 and the light fields , @xmath0 with a potential of the form @xmath29 in principle , moduli may have potentials @xmath30 , which for simplicity are assumed to be are negligible during inflation , or included into ( [ veff2 ] ) , as we will see below .    in eq .",
    "( [ veff2 ] ) the dependencies of the coupling constant on the moduli fields @xmath0 have quite different status .",

    "hence , the fluctuations of the fields @xmath0 have a mass @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the planck mass . but as we will see in the next section , the right amplitude of modulated fluctuations is achievable if the mass scale @xmath36 is of order or smaller than @xmath39 .",
    "thus , @xmath7 are heavy unless the coupling @xmath14 has no dependence on moduli .",
    "there is no such reservation for @xmath15 . in the following",

    "it is easy to see that @xmath0 also do not influence the evolution of the inflaton field and fluctuations during inflation .",

    "they are subdominant with respect to the vevs of @xmath4 and @xmath17 that drive the evolution of the background and do not affect the generation of metric perturbations during inflation .",

    "the transfer of modes is not not due to a bent of the trajectory but to the modulation .",
    "the outcome of such a mechanism could be the superposition of gaussian perturbations and a non - gaussian ones of the same variance .",
    "let us stress that no non - gaussianity is generated by the transition itself so that if fluctuations of the light field are initially gaussian so will be the modulated fluctuations .",
    "the last remarks are about the nature of modulated scalar fluctuations .",
    "first , note that this mechanism offers an example of situation in which the adiabatic mode is not conserved , an issue raised in ref .",
    "second , before the end of inflation , the moduli field fluctuations are subdominant gravitationally and have a character of isocurvature fluctuations .",
    "when the equation of state is changed the moduli field remains to be gravitationally subdominant ( contrary to the curvaton scenario where dominance of the curvaton is additionally assumed ) .",
    "however , the moduli field fluctuations vary the time hypersurface where equation of state is altered . at this moment",
