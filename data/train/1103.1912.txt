    "_ chandra _ x - ray observations of the nuclear regions of nearby seyfert galaxies appear to offer powerful diagnostics for discriminating between photoionization by the nuclear radiation or collisional ionization by a radio jet @xcite , although the importance of radio jets in shaping nlr environments seems to differ case - by - case @xcite .",

    "although the distribution of the ionized gas and the kinematics in the nlr imply that shock ionization originated from jet  cloud interactions is unlikely to be the dominant source of ionizing photons compared to the nucleus @xcite , @xcite find evidence that some nlr clouds are responsible for bending the jet .",
    "near - ir emission - line mapping of the nuclear region by @xcite also reveals enhancement of [ feii ] emission , suggesting the presence of shock heating in addition to nuclear photoionization @xcite .    in our previous work using the _ chandra _ hrc image of ngc 4151",
    ", @xcite found an excess of x - ray emission at these jet ",
    "cloud interaction locations .",
    "however , no spectral information could be obtained because of the very limited energy resolution of the hrc .",
    "acis spectral imaging data of the ngc 4151 nuclear region @xcite were limited by both heavy pile - up and sensitivity , and did not allow detailed high spatial resolution comparison to the radio jet and emission line gas , nor spectral studies of x - ray emission from spatially resolved features .",

    "2011 for previous work on this data set ) allows us to pursue these investigations , by comparing the morphology of the neix and ovii with that of the radio jet .",
    "moreover , with these data we can address the outstanding controversy on the spatial properties of the 6.4  kev fe k@xmath2 emission of ngc 4151 .",
    "in seyfert galaxies , this emission line is expected to originate from cold matter near the nucleus ( @xmath8  pc ) , either the obscuring torus ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or an accretion disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these model predictions , however , conflicted with the finding of @xcite , who reported spatially resolved narrow iron k@xmath2 line emission in the _ chandra _ hetg observation , concluding that @xmath9 of this emission originates in the enlr at distance up to 6 from the nucleus ( @xmath0400 pc across ) .",

    "briefly , ngc 4151 was observed by _",
    "chandra _ for a total of 180 ks ( after screening for high background intervals ) with the spectroscopic array of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - s ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in 1/8 sub - array mode during march 27 - 29 , 2008 .",
    "the data were reprocessed following standard procedures , using ciao ( version 4.2 ) with the caldb 4.2.1 provided by the _",
    "chandra _ x - ray center ( cxc ) .",
    "subpixel event repositioning ( `` static '' method in li et al .",
    "2004 , using the corner split and 2-pixel split events ) and subpixel binning techniques were applied to the acis images to improve the spatial resolution .    during our previous work",
    "@xcite and paper i , we became well aware of the complexity in data analysis caused by the bright nuclear emission of ngc 4151 .",
    "first , photon pile - up is present in the nuclear region even with the reduced frame - time of our observation .",
    "we established that for the soft x - ray emission , pile - up is moderate ( @xmath10 ) at @xmath11 .",
    "second , although the _ chandra _ s psf is highly centrally peaked , the contamination from the scattered nuclear emission to the extended emission is not negligible due to the brightness of the nucleus and the broader psf in the higher energy range .",
    "we performed _",
    "psf simulations that provide an estimate of the expected contamination from the nuclear emission in an extended feature .",
    "detailed explanation of the analysis leading to these conclusions is presented in paper i. we have taken into account this information in the following analysis .      the 27  kev emission is dominated by the unresolved nucleus @xcite . since we are interested in the extended x - ray emission , we used the energy range below 2 kev where this emission is prominent ( see paper i ) . to investigate the general spectral dependency of the morphology of this soft x - ray emission ,",
    "images in three spectral bands below 2 kev were extracted from the merged data : 0.30.7 kev ( `` soft band '' ) , 0.71.0 kev ( `` medium band '' ) , and 12 kev ( `` hard band '' ) . following @xcite , exposure maps were created for the individual bands to obtain exposure - corrected flux images .",
    "figure  [ 3color ] presents the resulting false color composite image of the central @xmath12 ( 450  pc on a side ) region of ngc 4151 , where the soft , medium , and hard band images are shown in red , green , and blue , respectively .",
    "the images in the three band have been smoothed with a @xmath13 gaussian kernel .",
    "it clearly shows bright structured soft x - ray emission along the northeast ( ne )  southwest ( sw ) direction , which is also the direction of the radio jet .",
    "in particular , the medium band image shows a jet - like @xmath02 linear extension ( contours in figure  [ 3color ] ) .",
    "this medium band is dominated by the neix emission ( see below ) . in the following we concentrate on the analysis of this inner 2-radius circum - nuclear region .",
    "high spectral resolution grating spectra of ngc 4151 @xcite have shown that the emission in these soft spectral bands is almost entirely dominated by lines .",
    "although the spectral resolution of acis ccd can not provide unique identifications of the strongest soft x - ray emission lines ( @xmath142  kev ) seen in the nuclear spectrum @xcite , we can identify the dominant transitions guided by the hetg observations @xcite .",
    "most notably the blended lines appear as three strong lines in the acis spectrum , approximately centered at 0.57  kev , 0.68  kev , 0.91  kev ( c.f . figure 4 in yang et al .",
    "2001 ; figure 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "we then extracted the x - ray emission in three narrow energy intervals ( 0.530.63 kev , blended ovii f , i , r ; 0.630.73 kev , blended oviii ly@xmath2 and ovii rrc ; 0.850.95 kev , blended neix f , i , r ) to create line strength images , highlighting regions of these prominent emission lines .",
    "this is a reasonable approach since the line emission dominates over the weak underlying continuum @xcite in these narrow bands and reveal substructures that are not obvious in the broadband images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting images are shown in figures  [ lines ] and  [ o3 ] , showing the x - ray emission - line structure close to the nucleus ( the central @xmath15 , @xmath0130 pc ) in the context of the radio outflow and the optical emission line clouds .",
    "the alignment between these images is done using the peak of x - ray emission , [ oiii ] emission , and the radio core . since the astrometry of our _ chandra _ image is accurate to @xmath16 , our interpretation of these features is not affected by significant alignment uncertainties .",
    "the position of the nucleus is indicated with a cross .",
    "the ovii , oviii , and neix emission line images all show extended morphology and some structures , closely following the p.a . of the large scale extended nlr traced by the [ oiii ] emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in particular",
    ", the linear feature seen in the medium - band is clearly present in the neix image .",
    "there appears to be two x - ray enhancements bracketed by the optical clouds ( indicated by arrows in figure  [ o3 ] ) that are close to the radio knot features c2 and c5 @xcite .",
    "these `` hot spots '' are better visualized in the neix / ovii ratio image , shown in figure  [ jet ] together with the vlba jet @xcite and the nir [ feii ] line emission @xcite .",
    "the locations where the jet appears to be intercepted by the optical clouds and where prominent [ feii ] emission arise , are characterised by a neix / ovii ratio of @xmath17 , which is significantly ( @xmath18 ) higher than the ratio in the surrounding regions ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "we also examined the optical clouds with high velocity dispersion , possibly associated with jet - cloud impact ( marked as crosses in figure  [ jet ] ; see figure  7 in mundell et al .  2003 ) , and find an elevated neix / ovii ratio of @xmath20 ( with marginal significance ) .",
    "the eastern neix / ovii hot spot appears to be associated with clear interactions between the jet and the gas cloud , where shock heating becomes important .",
    "we note that the observed line flux of ovii is more suppressed than neix in the presence of the galactic absorption column ( @xmath21 @xmath22 ) , and xspec @xcite simulations show the absorption corrected ratio may systematically decrease by 10% .",
    "thus the presence of neix / ovii hot spots is not affected , unless there is significant differential absorption in the region .",
    "we extracted x - ray spectra from both the high neix / ovii emission line ratio regions and the surrounding low ratio region ( figure  [ jet]b ) , and fit them jointly ( with the same model components but normalizations set free ) for comparison using xspec ( version 12.5 ; arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "spectra and instrument responses were generated using ciao tool _ specextract_. the background spectrum",
    "is taken from a nearby source - free region on the same ccd node .",
    "spectra were grouped to have a minimum of 20 counts per energy bin to allow for @xmath23 fitting . the contribution from the bright nuclear emission can not be neglected here ; to have a self - consistent model , we included a fraction of the scattered emission predicted from the psf simulation of the point - like ngc 4151 nucleus .",
    "we have made use of the cloudy photoionization modeling code , last described by @xcite , to model the soft x - ray emission . using cloudy version c08.00 , which enables a cloudy / xspec interface @xcite , we attempted to produce the soft part of the x - ray spectrum assuming an open plane - parallel geometry ( `` slab '' ) .",
    "the dimensionless ionization parameter @xcite is defined as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the hydrogen number density , @xmath26 is the distance to the inner face of the model slab , @xmath27 is the speed of light , and @xmath28 is the emitting rate of hydrogen ionizing photons ( s@xmath29 ) by the ionizing source . it was previously noted that the spectral fit to the soft x - ray continuum of the nucleus is quite uncertain because of heavy absorption @xcite , therefore we adopted the broken power - law form in @xcite for the agn continuum ( @xmath30 for the energy range between 13.6 ev and 0.5 kev , and @xmath31 for @xmath32  kev ) .",
    "normalizing to the observed x - ray luminosity of the nucleus @xcite , we obtain @xmath33 ( photons s@xmath29 ) .",
    "we varied @xmath34 and the column density @xmath35 of the model slab to create spectral model grids , which were fed to xspec .",
    "we quickly find that , using a single photoionized component alone can not reproduce the observed soft x - ray emission in ngc 4151 . with a high photoionization component ( @xmath36 )",
    ", we were able to produce the hydrogen - like neon and oxygen lines emission ( e.g. , oviii , nex ) , which are unambiguously present in all the grating spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the helium - like transitions , in particular the ovii and neix emission line features , are not fitted acceptably . adding a second lower ionization photoionized component ( @xmath37 ) ,",
    "as detected in @xcite , we were able to obtain a significantly improved fit ( @xmath38 ) , except for residuals in the 0.71.1 kev range that are particularly strong for the hot spot spectrum .",
    "adding additional photoionized components to the model does not further improve the fit when an f - test is performed . allowing different absorption columns for",
    "the models also does not give a better fit ( reduced @xmath39 ) , indicating that the high neix / ovii ratio is not due to higher obscuration .",
    "the absorption column required by the fits is consistent with the low galactic extinction towards the nlr region found in @xcite . instead , these residuals disappear when a thermal emission component ( @xmath40 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a temperature of @xmath41  kev is added to the model , suggesting the presence of collisionally ionized fe l emission .",
    "the spectral fitting results are summarized in table  1 and shown in figure  [ 2reg ] .",
    "the absorption column is consistent with the low galactic extinction towards the nlr region found in @xcite .",
    "lastly , we note that fitting the data with only combinations of absorbed optically - thin thermal emission ( @xmath40 ) gave strong residuals of emission line features ( reduced @xmath42 ) , even when the abundance @xmath43 is allowed to vary .",
    "the subpixel resolution acis image also allows a similar comparison of the x - ray emission with the optical nlr clouds resolved in the @xmath44 image . taking advantage of the spectral capability of acis",
    ", we measured the 0.32 kev counts for the same [ oiii ] clouds identified in @xcite , and derived their 0.52 kev x - ray fluxes using the spectral model above . to subtract the nuclear contribution",
    ", we used a local region at the same radii but with different azimuthal angles than the clouds .",
    "the results are listed in table  2 .",
    "figure  [ ratio ] shows these [ oiii ] to soft x - ray ratios , comparing the measurements with hrc results in @xcite and photoionization models in @xcite .",
    "the [ oiii]/x - ray ratios at the two x - ray hot spot locations ( corresponding to radio knots c2 and c5 in @xcite ) were also measured , and found to be uniformly low , @xmath03 .",
    "this was previously noted in @xcite , and implies enhanced x - ray emission compared to other clouds under nuclear photoionization , which is likely associated with the jet  cloud interaction and consistent with their association with high neix / ovii ratio regions .",
    "the 6.4  kev fluorescent iron k@xmath2 emission of neutral or mildly ionized cold material is readily visible in the acis spectra of the nucleus @xcite and the extended region ( figure  [ fek1]a ) . another fluorescent feature , sii k@xmath2 emission at 1.74  kev , is also clearly present in the extended emission ( figure  [ fek1]b ) .",
    "both spectra of extended emission were extracted from a @xmath45 annular region centered on the nucleus .",
    "is this `` extended '' fluorescent line emission truly originating from outside the nuclear region , or is it the result of the psf wing spreading out point - like nuclear features ?    to determine the spatial distribution of the fe k@xmath2 line emitting material , we followed the procedure in @xcite : a continuum image , taken to be the average of the counts in the 5.96.2 kev and 6.56.8 kev bands , was subtracted from the image extracted in the 6.26.5 kev band , resulting in a `` pure '' fek@xmath2 line image , shown in figure  [ fek2]a .",
    "the fe k@xmath2 emission appears mostly circular in the @xmath46 , but shows faint extended emission towards the north and west .",
    "the si k@xmath2 line is blended with the mgxii ly@xmath47 and sixiii @xmath48 emission @xcite , thus the above continuum subtraction is not applied .",
    "we extracted emission in the 1.71.8 kev range to obtain the si k@xmath2 emission map ( figure  [ fek2]b ) .",
    "it is mostly concentrated within a @xmath49 circle , with a slight elongation along the optical bi - cone direction ( northeast  southwest ) .",
    "however , at such energies the wings of the energy - dependent telescope psf spread a small but non - negligible amount of the nuclear photons to large radii .",
    "thus the presence of `` extended '' fe k@xmath2 emission or si k@xmath2 emission in the @xmath50 region may in fact come from the psf - scattered unresolved nuclear emission .    to investigate this point",
    ", we further compared the observed radial profile of the fe k@xmath2 emission band ( 6.26.5 kev ) and the radial profile in the same band for a point - like nucleus simulated with marx ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , shown in figure  [ fek]a . a similar comparison for the si k@xmath2 ( 1.71.8 kev ) is shown in figure  [ fek]b .",
    "the extracted observed profiles shown in figure  [ fek ] agree well with the psf profiles , except for the inner @xmath51 where the simulation overpredicted the observed emission due to heavy pile up in the psf core .",
    "the simulated psfs indicate that the @xmath46 region contains 89% of the point source emission in the 6.26.5 kev band and 94% of the point source emission in the 1.71.8 kev band .",
    "approximately 6% of the nuclear fe k@xmath2 emission is expected to be spread within the @xmath52 extended regions , the extent of fe k@xmath2 seen in figure  [ fek1]a .",
    "taking into account the contribution from the psf wings , the remaining extended fe k@xmath2 emission is @xmath53 of the total fe k@xmath2 emission .",
    "this should be considered an upper limit for the truly extended emission , because the nuclear fe k@xmath2 emission is likely to be underestimated due to pile up .",
    "similarly , we estimated that the extended si k@xmath2 emission is @xmath54 of the total si k@xmath2 emission . as pointed out by the referee , the measured extended emission could easily disappear with a slightly broader simulated psf given that the ditherblur parameter in the marx simulation is not known a priori .",
    "therefore , we conclude that although there is faint extended emission seen in the fe and si fluorescent line images , at most 5% of the observed fe k@xmath2 emission and 4% of the si k@xmath2 emission can be truly spatially extended ; most of these emissions are consistent with the psf scattering of a strong nuclear component .",
    "both our previous work using hrc image of ngc 4151 nuclear region @xcite and this work using acis find that most of the nlr clouds in the central 150  pc radius region of ngc 4151 have a relatively constant [ oiii ] to soft x - ray ratio ( @xmath010 ; figure  [ ratio ] and table  2 ) , no matter the distance of the clouds from the nucleus .",
    "this ratio indicates a uniform ionization parameter and a density decreasing as @xmath55",
    ". this may be consistent with a photoionized wind scenario ( e.g. , bianchi et al .",
    "2006 ) as the nlr clouds are outflowing ( e.g. , kaiser et al .",
    "the [ oiii]/x - ray ratios at the locations of jet - cloud collision are lower ( @xmath03 ) , leading to the suggestion of enhanced x - ray emission in these regions due to shock heating in addition to photoionization .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the results of multiwavelength imaging studies .",
    "the high spatial resolution emission line images of ovii , oviii , and neix emission show extended structures , in particular two `` hot spots '' in the neix image , which are close to the radio knot features ( figures  [ lines ] and  [ o3 ] ) . at these locations ( 1 from the nucleus )",
    ", @xcite noted that the morphology of the highly collimated radio outflows appears more disturbed , suggesting interaction with some dense clouds here .",
    "there are also clearly optical clouds with high velocity dispersion associated with the jet ",
    "cloud impact @xcite .",
    "the radio knots are near to the location of strong [ feii ] emission @xcite , falling between the peaks of the [ feii ] emission .    altogether , the morphology suggests a scenario where the radio ejecta runs into a denser cloud in the inhomogeneous ism and results in locally enhanced shock heating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "cloud interaction has been suggested to explain the enhanced [ feii ] emission , which could be due to the iron unlocked from grains by the shocks @xcite",
    ". the neix emission , which traces the higher ionization gas , becomes more prominent with the extra collisional ionization from the jet  cloud interaction .",
    "@xcite also noted that the poor fit to the ovii line profile in the grating spectra could be due to presence of a non - photoionization component .",
    "this possibility is further supported by our spectral fits , which suggest that the neix / ovii enhancements have a thermal origin , requiring the presence of a collisionally ionized plasma ( the @xmath41  kev component ) in addition to a photoionized nuclear outflow @xcite .",
    "the emission measure of the @xmath40 component allows us to estimate the electron density @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) and the thermal pressure @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) . the emitting volume ( @xmath60 ) of the hot gas , assuming that the depth along the line of sight is comparable to the other dimensions , is @xmath61 @xmath62 for the high neix / ovii ratio hot spots .",
    "the filling factor @xmath63 is assumed to be 100% and both of @xmath56 and @xmath58 have a weak dependence on @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "there is @xmath65 uncertainty in @xmath66 , which is propagated to the estimated pressure and energy . for the @xmath67  kev emission , we derived an average density @xmath68 @xmath69 , a hot gas pressure @xmath70 dyne @xmath22 , a thermal energy content of @xmath71 ergs , and a cooling time of @xmath72 yr . the estimated internal pressure of the radio jet based on the synchrotron minimum energy assumption ranges between @xmath73 and @xmath74 dyne @xmath22 ( pedlar et al . 1993 ) , to be confined by the hot gas pressure of @xmath74 dyne @xmath22 , which further supports our collisional ionization scenario .",
    "assuming @xmath75  k for the photoionized clouds and @xmath76 @xmath69 @xcite , the thermal pressure from the photoionized gas is @xmath77 dyne @xmath22 , which is comparable to the thermal pressure of the hot ism , implying a possible pressure equilibrium between the collisionally ionized hot gas and the photoionized line - emitting cool clouds .",
    "we further estimate the age of the interaction from the approximate crossing time of the @xmath78 region ( dimension of the radio knot ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a characteristic velocity of @xmath79 km s@xmath29 , the local sound speed .",
    "this is approximately the thermal velocity for the 0.58  kev gas ( @xmath80 km s@xmath29 ) , and also at the order of velocity dispersion of emission line gas seen in @xcite . assuming the strong shock jump conditions , a crude estimate of the shock velocity @xmath81 can be obtained using @xmath82  k @xmath83  km s@xmath84 @xcite . for the @xmath85",
    "k x - ray - emitting gas , a @xmath81 of @xmath0700 km s@xmath29 relative to the downstream material is required .",
    "this appears consistent with a supersonic but relatively slow radio jet , which is constrained to be sub - relativistic from radio proper motion estimates ( e.g. , @xmath86  km s@xmath29 ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus we obtain a characteristic timescale of @xmath87 yr .    if the jet  cloud interaction converts kinematic energy into heating of the hot gas , a lower limit can be placed on the kinematic luminosity of the jet , @xmath88 erg s@xmath29 .",
    "it is interesting to compare this observed @xmath89 to the jet power directly inferred from the synchrotron emission . using the @xmath90@xmath91 scaling relation ( equation 1 ) in @xcite and a total radio luminosity at 1.4 ghz ( @xmath92 erg s@xmath29 ;",
    "* ) , we find @xmath93 erg s@xmath29 , suggesting that @xmath1 of the jet power is deposited in the ism .",
    "however , recalling that the @xmath90@xmath91 relation was derived from a sample of radio loud galaxies with x - ray cavities ( see @xcite for review on the @xmath90@xmath91 scaling relation ) while here ngc 4151 is of low radio power , we also estimate directly the jet energy flux using the pressure in the knots @xcite based on the minimal energy assumption , giving a similar @xmath94 erg s@xmath29 .",
    "we further note that , the crossing time @xmath95 is comparable to the cooling time @xmath96 , implying that the hot gas is prominent only locally ( close to the radio knots ) . indeed , along the path of the radio jet ,",
    "the clouds that are spatially close to the jet impact spots ( e.g. , clouds # 3,4 bracketing knot c2 ; # 9,10 for knot c5 ) show [ oiii]/x - ray ratios indistinguishable from others ( figure  [ ratio ] ) .",
    "if these clouds are physically related to the ism interacting with the jet , instead of being projected close to the knots in our line - of - sight , their x - ray emission shows little evidence for excess shock heating in addition to nuclear photoionization .",
    "this localized heating is perhaps related to the highly collimated radio ejecta in ngc 4151 @xcite , in contrast to the more expanded lobe - like radio outflow in mrk 3 @xcite , where the nlr gas appears broadly impacted .",
    "we plan to investigate in future work whether the [ oiii]/x - ray ratio , such as @xmath974 measured here and seen in mrk 3 and ngc 1386 @xcite , together with other line ratios ( e.g. , [ feii]/[pii ] ; @xcite ) could be useful diagnostics for strong jet ",
    "ism interaction in seyfert galaxies .    in terms of energetics",
    ", we summarize our findings in ngc 4151 : ( a ) the jet power estimated from the radio power is @xmath98 erg s@xmath29 , a few percent of the current agn energy output ( @xmath99 erg s@xmath29 ; * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite claimed that the narrow iron line emission was spatially resolved in the _ chandra _ hetg observation and @xmath100 of the fei k@xmath2 emission comes from the enlr at distance up to 6extent ( @xmath0400 pc across ) .",
    "this is intriguing , since the putative pc - scale torus or more compact broad - line region ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) are expected to be the primary location of narrow fei k@xmath2 emission .",
    "@xcite cautioned that due to the sensitivity of the short grating observation in @xcite , the 13 arcsec region off the peak of cross - dispersion profile contains few photons .",
    "therefore the detection of spatially extended iron line emission can not be significant .",
    "a high signal - to - noise xmm - newton spectrum of the neutral fe k@xmath2 suggests that all line flux originates in a nearly compton - thick torus that is not resolvable at current resolution @xcite .",

    "this is consistent with our constraint on the extent of the si fluorescent emission and supports the conclusions of @xcite , while it is in strong disagreement with the @xmath102 reported in @xcite .",

    "the marx model is now much more advanced so that a more reliable estimate becomes possible . at 6.4 kev ,",
    "the encircled energy fraction of a point source is only @xmath104 ( see @xmath105 proposers observatory guide chapter 4 table 4.2 ) in such a psf core . hence a significant fraction of the nuclear emission could have been measured in ogle et al . as spatially extended fe k@xmath2 emission .",
    "in this paper we present spectral analysis and emission line images from deep _ chandra _ observation of ngc 4151 , aiming to resolve and characterise the x - ray emission in the inner @xmath0130 pc - radius nuclear region .",
    "the findings are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we have obtained high spatial resolution x - ray narrow - band images of ovii , oviii , and neix line emission , which are blended at the acis spectral resolution .",
    "the images show extended structures that are spatially correlated with the radio outflow and optical [ oiii ] emission .",
    "2 .   we find strong evidence for jet ",
    "ism interaction , including morphological correspondences with regions of x - ray enhancement , peaks of nir [ feii ] emission , and optical clouds .",
    "this is further strengthened by the presence of a @xmath67  kev collisionally ionized component in the spectral fitting of the hot spots , and by the excess of x - ray emission in addition to nuclear photoionization as indicated by a low [ oiii]/x - ray ratio .",
    "we find a possible pressure equilibrium between the collisionally ionized hot gas and the photoionized cool clouds .",
    "the estimated velocity of the shocks from the jet ",
    "cloud impact is @xmath0700 km s@xmath29 .",
    "we estimate that the jet power in ngc 4151 is close to a few percent of the current agn energy output ( @xmath106 erg s@xmath29 ) .",
    "the derived thermal energy in the hot gas suggests that @xmath1 of the jet power is deposited into the host ism in the nuclear region through the interaction between the radio - jet and the dense medium .",
    "the [ oiii]/x - ray ratios of nlr clouds bracketing the radio knots show little deviation from other photoionized clouds , indicating a localized impact on the ism by the highly collimated jet .",
    "we investigate the spatial extent of the fluorescent features , including the fe k@xmath2 emission and the si k@xmath2 emission .",
    "our results show that both are dominated by point - like emission , consistent with an origin of unresolved inner structure such as a torus .",
    "the extended fe k@xmath2 emission is @xmath3 of the observed fe k@xmath2 emission , which is in strong disagreement with the @xmath102 reported in @xcite .",
