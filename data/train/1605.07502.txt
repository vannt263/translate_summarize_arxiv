    "@xmath0nb  is a slightly neutron - deficient odd - odd ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) nucleus with a long half - life of @xmath3y .",
    "it decays preferentially by electron capture to @xmath0zr whereas the energetically also possible @xmath4-decay to @xmath0mo was not observed . the long half - life of @xmath0nb  results from the high @xmath5 of the @xmath0nb  ground state which suppresses @xmath6-decays to low - lying states in @xmath0zr  or @xmath0mo .",
    "contrary to the @xmath0nb  ground state , the first excited state of @xmath0nb  at @xmath7kev has a low @xmath8 .",
    "thus , direct electromagnetic m5 or e6 transitions to the @xmath5 ground state are highly suppressed , and the @xmath9 isomer decays also by electron capture to @xmath0zr  with a short half - life of @xmath10d which is 9 orders of magnitude smaller than the half - life of the @xmath0nb  ground state . except explicitly noted ,",
    "all properties of @xmath0nb  have been taken from the ensdf database @xcite which is based on the nuclear data sheets @xcite .",
    "unstable nuclei with half - lives of the order of several ten million years are considered as potential chronometers for the time between the last nucleosynthesis event and the birth of our sun . for this purpose",
    "the production of these unstable nuclei is compared to the abundance in the early solar system which can be derived from meteoritic data ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , in the case of @xmath0nb , the production remains relatively uncertain .",
    "it is clear that @xmath0nb  can not be produced in the two main neutron capture processes .",
    "the nucleosynthesis path in the slow neutron capture process ( @xmath11-process ) bypasses @xmath0nb , and @xmath0nb  is shielded from production in the rapid neutron capture process ( @xmath12-process ) by the stable isobar @xmath0zr .",
    "the stable isobar @xmath0mo  shields @xmath0nb  also from production under conditions of the rapid proton capture process ( @xmath13-process )",
    ". thus , only very few astrophysical processes remain as candidates for the nucleosynthesis of @xmath0nb  which are in particular the so - called @xmath14-process  and neutrino - induced nucleosynthesis .    under @xmath14-process  conditions @xmath0nb",
    "may be produced by the @xmath15nb(@xmath16,n)@xmath0nb  reaction although further destruction by the @xmath0nb(@xmath16,n)@xmath17nb  reaction could occur .",
    "alternatively , the @xmath17zr(p,@xmath16)@xmath0nb  reaction may produce @xmath0nb  in a proton - rich @xmath14-process  environment .",
    "as astrophysical sites for the @xmath14-process , supernova ( sn ) explosions of core - collapse type ( sn type - ii ) or thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs ( sn type ia ) have been suggested ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "very recently it has been emphasized that @xmath0nb  can be used to constrain models of @xmath14-process  nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "neutrino - induced nucleosynthesis of @xmath0nb  occurs via the @xmath0zr(@xmath18,@xmath19)@xmath0nb  or @xmath15nb(@xmath20,@xmath21)@xmath0nb  reactions where the high neutrino flux is provided by a forming neutron star after a core - collapse sn @xcite . in any case",
    ", the nucleosynthesis of @xmath0nb  occurs in an explosive scenario with timescales of the order of 1 second and temperatures of at least 1 billion kelvin ( @xmath22 , @xmath23kev ) .",
    "the nucleosynthesis of @xmath0nb  may be significantly influenced by the properties of the low - lying @xmath8 isomer at @xmath24kev which is coupled to the @xmath5 ground state via so - called intermediate states ( ims ) .",
    "interestingly , most of the previous studies did not take into account this isomer ; up to now only meyer @xcite has pointed out that `` accurate predictions of the @xmath15nb/@xmath0nb  production ratio , then , will require an appropriate treatment of the isomeric state in the nucleosynthesis calculations '' . in general ,",
    "three questions have to be answered : ( @xmath25 ) what is the production ratio between @xmath26 ground state and @xmath9 isomer ? ( @xmath27 ) how is the production ratio during the explosive production affected by thermal couplings via the ims ? ( @xmath28 )",
    "does the coupling via the ims affect the later survival of @xmath0nb ?",
    "in advance , i provide the answers to these questions from the following discussion of the properties of the ims with @xmath29 at @xmath30kev : ( @xmath25 ) and ( @xmath27 ) : the coupling between @xmath26 ground state and @xmath9 isomer is so strong that thermal equilibrium between ground state and isomer is reached almost instantaneously and maintained at least down to temperatures of the order of 20kev .",
    "these low temperatures correspond to an almost negligible boltzmann ratio of @xmath31 .",
    "thus , almost 100% of the produced @xmath0nb  survives , independent of the production ratio of isomer and ground state .",
    "( @xmath28 ) the strong coupling between @xmath9 isomer and @xmath26 ground state leads to a strongly temperature - dependent effective half - life of @xmath0nb . already at @xmath32kev ,",
    "the effective half - life is reduced by one order of magnitude , and at @xmath33kev the reduction of the effective half - life reaches a factor of 1000 .",
    "this may turn @xmath0nb  from a chronometer into a sensitive thermometer for the thermal history between the nucleosynthesis of @xmath0nb  in an explosive astrophysical event and the formation of the early solar system .",
    "because of the spin difference @xmath34 between the @xmath26 ground state and @xmath9 isomer , a direct @xmath16-ray ( m5 or e6 ) transition is strongly suppressed by the electromagnetic selection rules .",
    "any transition between ground state and isomer must proceed via imss at higher excitation energies which are excited by thermal photons .",
    "the number of photons in a thermal stellar photon bath decreases exponentially with energy @xmath35 ; thus , typically the ims with the lowest excitation energy dominates the transition rates at stellar temperatures .",
    "a careful inspection of the level scheme of @xmath0nb  shows that the lowest ims is the @xmath36 state at @xmath30kev .",
    "all levels below the ims with @xmath37 decay finally to the @xmath9 isomer ( `` low-@xmath38 states '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : level ] , left part ) whereas the only level with @xmath39 below the ims decays only to the @xmath26 ground state ( `` high-@xmath38 states '' ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that there are only two further states in @xmath0nb  above the ims and below an excitation energy of 1mev .",
    "the @xmath40 state at 501.3kev is a high-@xmath38 state which decays exclusively to the @xmath26 ground state , and the @xmath41 state at 975.0kev is a low-@xmath38 state which decays exclusively to the @xmath42 state at 225.8kev .",
    "thus , the @xmath36 state at 480.3kev is the only ims in @xmath0nb  below @xmath43mev , and the coupling between ground state and isomer under stellar conditions is essentially defined by this ims .    the lifetime and the decay branches of the @xmath36 ims are known from experiment @xcite .",
    "the decay branches have been measured in several independent ( @xmath14,@xmath44@xmath16 ) , ( @xmath45,@xmath46@xmath16 ) , and ( @xmath47,@xmath44@xmath16 ) experiments , and good agreement was found @xcite : @xmath48% for the transition to the @xmath49 state at @xmath50kev and @xmath51% for the transition to the @xmath52 state at @xmath53kev .",
    "the @xmath49 state decays with 100% to the @xmath26 ground state whereas the @xmath52 state decays with 100% to the @xmath9 isomer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : level ] ) .",
    "the lifetime of the ims is reported only in an unpublished laboratory report usip-74 - 17 of the university of stockholm which is fortunately available on the web @xcite . a half - life of @xmath54 ( without units )",
    "is given in table vi of @xcite .",
    "however , from the text in @xcite it becomes obvious that the half - life is 0.62ps , corresponding to m1 transition strengths of the order of several @xmath55 for the above mentioned transitions .",
    "surprisingly , a half - life of 0.62ns has been adopted in @xcite , and this value persists until now @xcite .    at stellar temperatures , thermal equilibrium within states with low @xmath38 on the one hand and within high @xmath38 states on the other hand",
    "is established almost instantaneously because the levels are connected by allowed @xmath16-transitions . as a consequence ,",
    "the transition rate from the @xmath26 ground state to the @xmath9 isomer depends on the stellar integrated cross section @xmath56 of the ims @xmath57 with the partial radiation width @xmath58 summed over all partial widths @xmath59 leading finally to the @xmath9 isomer and a similar definition for @xmath60 for transitions to the @xmath26 ground state .",
    "note that the properties of the thermally excited states with @xmath61 and @xmath62 do not appear in eq .",
    "( [ eq : isigmastar ] ) .",
    "the reason for this cancellation is discussed in detail in @xcite . the spin factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : isigmastar ] ) is given by @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "for the transition from the @xmath26 ground state to the @xmath9 isomer the integrated cross section via the @xmath36 ims is @xmath64ev@xmath65 with an uncertainty of about 20% which is given by the 16% uncertainty of the lifetime of the ims and the 13% uncertainty of the branching ratio .",
    "values of the same order of magnitude have been obtained for integrated cross sections in the neighboring odd - odd nucleus @xmath66ag @xcite , whereas this result is about a factor of @xmath67 larger than the lowest experimentally known imss in the heavy odd - odd nuclei @xmath68lu @xcite and @xmath69ta @xcite which are located at slightly higher excitation energies . the lowest ims candidate in @xmath69ta",
    "is located at a similar excitation energy as the @xmath36 ims in @xmath0nb ; its integrated cross section is almost six orders of magnitude smaller @xcite .",
    "also relatively small values have been estimated for a low - lying @xmath70-mixing ims in @xmath68lu @xcite .",
    "very recently , imss have also been searched for in @xmath71re @xcite .",
    "the reaction rate @xmath72 for the @xmath73 transition via the @xmath36 ims at @xmath30kev is given by @xmath74 with the integrated cross section @xmath75 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : isigmastar ] ) and thermal photon density @xmath76 the result is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : rate ] .",
    "one finds a dramatic variation of the transition rate as a function of temperature ( given as thermal energy @xmath77 throughout this paper ) . already at @xmath78kev the rate exceeds @xmath79/s , thus leading to thermalization of isomer and ground state under any typical conditions of explosive nucleosynthesis .",
    "consequently , the production ratio between @xmath9 isomer and @xmath26 ground state of @xmath0nb  does not play any role for the nucleosynthesis of @xmath0nb  because the properties of the @xmath36 ims ensure thermal equilibrium within less than 1 microsecond for any temperature above @xmath78kev .",
    "in retrospect , this validates all previous studies which did not take into account the isomer in the production of @xmath0nb .",
    "for completeness it should be mentioned that the rate for the reverse transition from the @xmath9 isomer to the @xmath26 ground state can be derived in the same way according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : isigmastar ] ) and ( [ eq : planck ] ) . as a result , the reverse rate is related to the forward rate by detailed balance @xcite .",
    "after the explosive nucleosynthesis event the temperature drops .",
    "as soon as the rate @xmath80 falls below the timescale of the explosive nucleosynthesis event , thermal equilibrium between the @xmath9 isomer and @xmath26 ground state can not persist .",
    "this happens at the relatively low temperature of @xmath81 19kev for a typical supernova explosion with timescales of the order of one second . at this low temperature",
    "the ratio between isomer and ground state is given by the boltzmann factor @xmath82 .",
    "thus , practically all @xmath0nb  survives in the @xmath26 ground state . because of the steep temperature dependence of the reaction rate @xmath80 , the freeze - out temperature does not vary dramatically for a broader range of explosion timescales .",
    "an increase ( decrease ) of the explosive timescale by a factor of 10 reduces ( increases ) the freeze - out temperature by less than 2kev which does not affect the almost 100% survival probability of @xmath0nb  in its @xmath26 ground state .",
    "although thermal equilibrium between the @xmath26 ground state and the @xmath9 isomer can not be maintained at low temperatures , there is still a tiny probability for a transition between ground state and isomer .",
    "this leads to a temperature - dependent effective half - life of @xmath0nb  and may affect the survival of @xmath0nb  in the cooling phase after its explosive production or in any later re - heating .",
    "qualitatively , as long as the transition rate @xmath80 is much smaller than the @xmath6-decay constant @xmath83/s , the effective half - life remains constant at its laboratory value . at about 8kev @xmath80 becomes comparable to @xmath84 , and thus the @xmath9 isomer is weakly populated .",
    "now the @xmath6-decay rate @xmath85/s is faster than the transition back to the ground state which leads to @xmath6-decay of the isomer and a reduction of the effective half - life of @xmath0nb  which scales with the transition rate @xmath80 . at higher temperatures above 20kev , thermal equilibrium",
    "is established , and here the effective half - life scales with the boltzmann factor of the isomer and its @xmath6-decay constant @xmath86 . the resulting effective half - life of @xmath0nb  is shown in fig .  [ fig : t12eff ] .",
    "unfortunately , there is a further complication .",
    "the @xmath6-decay constants @xmath87 ) and @xmath86 in @xmath0nb  are dominated by electron capture ( mainly from the @xmath70-shell ) .",
    "the binding energy of a @xmath70-electron in @xmath0nb  is 19.0kev .",
    "thus , at higher temperatures the @xmath6-decay constants of ground state and isomer will decrease significantly .",
    "this effect depends on the ionization state of @xmath0nb  which in turn depends on temperature and electron density of the surrounding plasma .",
    "independent of temperature and density , the @xmath9 isomer has a small @xmath88-decay branching with a branching ratio of @xmath89 , whereas @xmath88-decay has not been observed for the @xmath26 ground state .",
    "an extreme upper limit of the effective half - life of @xmath0nb  can thus be calculated from the @xmath88-decay branch of the isomer .",
    "this is shown as dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : t12eff ] .",
    "it is difficult to provide a general estimate of the effective half - life of @xmath0nb  under realistic astrophysical conditions as long as the astrophysical scenario and the resulting plasma density are not known .",
    "nevertheless , it can be concluded that the steep drop of the effective half - life around @xmath90kev is real because at these temperatures the @xmath70-shell of @xmath0nb  is not yet fully ionized . as an example , the effective half - life is also shown for an intermediate electron density @xmath91/@xmath92 in fig .",
    "[ fig : t12eff ] .",
    "one can see a small increase of the effective half - life around @xmath93kev because of the starting ionization of the @xmath70-shell .",
    "this increase is followed by a steep decrease around @xmath90kev which is governed by the transition rate from the @xmath26 ground state to the @xmath9 isomer ; even when partly ionized , the @xmath6-decay of the isomer will still be sufficiently fast ( see the above qualitative discussion of the effective half - life ) .    finally , the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : t12eff ] shows clearly that the dominating uncertainties for the effective half - life of @xmath0nb  result from the astrophysical conditions whereas the nuclear uncertainties are marginal .",
    "nevertheless , an independent confirmation of the unpublished lifetime of the @xmath36 ims in @xmath0nb  from @xcite is desirable .",
    "the present study has shown that the low - lying @xmath9 isomer at @xmath7kev does not play a significant role in the production of @xmath0nb  in any explosive scenario .",
    "thermal equilibrium is maintained down to low temperatures below @xmath94kev where the boltzmann population of the @xmath9 isomer is already practically negligble .",
    "thus the present study validates in retrospect the previous nucleosynthesis studies of @xmath0nb  where the isomer was not taken into account .",
    "however , the coupling to the isomer leads to a dramatically reduced effective half - life of @xmath0nb  at temperatures as low as @xmath95kev .",
    "thus , any re - heating of the freshly synthesized @xmath0nb  above 8kev , e.g.  in the x - ray emitting supernova ejecta with its typical temperatures in the low kev range @xcite , will reduce its abundance significantly .",
    "this turns @xmath0nb  at least partly from a chronometer to a thermometer for the thermal evolution after the last nucleosynthesis event before the formation of our solar system .",
