    "in contrast , the spectral envelope that corresponds to @xmath91 is not consistent with the measured data .",

    "the ec density is calculated from the measured ratio @xmath58 and the measured q of each resonance , assuming that @xmath12 is uniform over the volume .",
    "equation  [ eq : ne ] is used with the sideband index @xmath89 is always equal to one ; @xmath57 is the fourier coefficient of the convolved phase modulation using the approximations leading to eqs .",

    "the maximum @xmath58 of this measurement is roughly 0.040 , which is within the range of validity of linear approximations discussed in section  [ sensitivity ] .",
    "if the ec density were uniform over the length of this section of beam - pipe , the data obtained from these five resonances should coincide .",
    "but at the highest current , the measured ec densities vary by about 30  % .",
    "the differences in these measurements are too large to be explained by errors in the measurement of the @xmath29 of each resonance or of the sideband ratios @xmath95 .",
    "it suggests that the ec density is not uniform and that the distribution of the standing waves is not symmetric .",
    "this points out the importance of knowing the distribution of standing waves within a resonant section .",
    "the ec density will generally not be uniform over the volume , especially when sections of the vacuum surface are coated with materials intended to minimize the production of electron cloud . as suggested at the beginning of section  [ calculation ] , when the ec density varies with position in the chamber it important to know the field distribution of the resonance since from eq .",
    "[ dw : ne ] this determines the contribution of each part of the chamber to the measurement .",
    "it is difficult to infer the field distribution of a resonance except in the simplest cases , such as when the series of resonances follows the @xmath96 of a shorted section of waveguide .",
    "if this is not the case , modeling of the detailed geometry of the section of beam - pipe would be needed , or some method of measuring the effect of the more complex geometry on the resonant fields .",
    "we measured the resonant field distribution of an assembly of four chambers before they were installed in the l3 section of the storage ring  @xcite .",
    "the 60  cm long chambers have two different cross sections : one round and the other round with grooves on the upper and lower vacuum surfaces .",
    "one of each geometry has a vacuum surface of bare aluminum and the other pair has coatings of tin .",
    "the final assembly has the grooved and smooth chambers alternating .    to determine the field distribution in the four chamber assembly ,",
    "a 0.3  @xmath97 nylon bead was guided along the axis of the beam - pipe and changes in the resonant frequency recorded .",
    "the frequency shift is proportional to the square of the electric field at the location of the bead  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ tew : beadpull_aluminum ] shows the result of one of the bead pull measurements , where bpm buttons were used to couple microwaves into and out of the beam - pipe at the same longitudinal position .",
    "the measurements show that the resonant field is mostly confined to the 60  cm long aluminum grooved chamber at two frequencies corresponding to @xmath98 .",
    "other measurements gave a similar result for the 60  cm tin coated grooved chamber at slightly different frequencies and using a different bpm coupler location .",
    "the confinement of the resonant fields is due to the slightly lower cutoff frequency of the grooved chambers compared with their smooth wall neighbors .",
    "the ability to excite these two sections of the chamber independently allows the direct comparison of ec density in the two grooved chambers and the mitigating effects of the tin coating versus a bare aluminum vacuum surface .",
    "based on the bench measurements of the four chamber assembly , bpm couplers and resonant frequencies were selected to make measurements of ec density in the bare aluminum and the tin coated chambers with beam .",
    "figure  [ tew : tin_vs_al ] compares the ec density versus total beam current for the these configurations .",
    "these two sets of measurements were made at the same time , with high bandwidth coaxial relays used to switch the drive and receive locations between the aluminum and tin chambers at each beam current .",
    "the beam is a 10-bunch train of 5.3  gev positrons with 14  ns spacing and total beam current ranging from near zero to 80  ma ( @xmath94  positrons / bunch ) .",
    "only the lowest sidebands were recorded and used to calculate the ec density from eq .",
    "[ eq : ne ] .    the plots in fig .",
    "[ tew : tin_vs_al ] show that a much lower ec density is measured in the tin coated chamber , even though it is closer to the source of synchrotron light than the bare aluminum chamber .",
    "the measurements at the two frequencies in the bare aluminum chamber are within about 10% of each other , as are those in the tin chamber .",
    "this gives increased confidence that the mitigating effect of the tin coating can be quantified once the data has been normalized for synchrotron radiation flux .",
    "this would not have been possible without the understanding of the distribution of microwaves in these chambers that was obtained through the bead pull measurements .",
    "the ec density in accelerator beam - pipe can be measured by resonantly exciting the beam - pipe with microwaves .",
    "the sensitivity of the resonant technique is increased by the @xmath29 of the resonance , making it much more sensitive than the original microwave transmission technique .",
    "however , a high @xmath29 also results in less sensitivity to dynamic changes in ec density , since these changes will be convolved with the impulse response of the resonance .",
    "calculations of ec density are based on the approximations that the plasma collision frequency @xmath7 is low , magnetic fields can be neglected and that the sidebands are generated by phase modulation of a fixed drive frequency . when changes in ec density take place on a similar or shorter time scale than the damping time of the resonance , convolution with the resonance impulse response is needed to calculate the phase modulation sidebands .",
    "the calculated envelope of the sidebands is in fair agreement with measurements made at cesrta of the first ten sidebands .    for convenience ,",
    "the calculations and measurements presented here have used the approximation that the ec density is uniform over the resonant volume , but can vary with time .",
    "another approximation is that the ec density has a fixed value when the beam is present in the chamber and zero otherwise .",
    "these approximations make it straightforward to calculate results analytically .    a careful analysis of eq .",
    "[ dw : ne ] would require a more detailed estimate of both the time and spatial distribution of the ec density @xmath12 and of the spatial distribution of the resonant microwaves @xmath10 .",
    "bead pull measurements are useful in determining the distribution of the resonant field within the beam - pipe .",
    "measurements have shown resonances confined to sections of beam - pipe less than a meter long .",
    "a combination of these techniques has been used to show the mitigating effect of a tin coating on an aluminum chamber .",
