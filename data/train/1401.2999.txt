    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are encouraged for future studies .    first , the observed photometric light curves in each band and with very different time resolution and inhomogeneous coverage were resampled to a common @xmath62day using the stochastic interpolation technique described in @xcite and @xcite . for each band , 10 random realizations of the resampled light curves",
    "were simulated . from the resampled @xmath63 light curves ,",
    "a reference bbb light curve was extracted .",
    "for that , the mean fluxes and standard deviations over the 10 random realizations of each band and epoch were calculated and a simple power law @xmath64 was fit to the resulting @xmath63 fluxes at each resampled epoch . based on this fit , a @xmath11-band flux at 0.55@xmath14 was determined .",
    "this method uses the maximum information of all bands simultaneously and the resulting bbb light curve is very close to the input agn variability pattern .    in the next step ,",
    "the bbb light curve was subtracted from the @xmath25 band fluxes .",
    "this procedure can produce negative fluxes and leaves some bbb variability in the result because of the overestimation of the bbb underlying the @xmath25 band and the wavelength - dependence of the variability .",
    "however , as we are interested only in the time delay signal , this does not need to be of concern .",
    "the most important result from this procedure is that a large part of the bbb signal has been removed in this @xmath65bbb light curve .    finally , the _ observed _ epochs of the @xmath65bbb light curve are ( discretely ) cross - correlated with the bbb light curve by interpolating the bbb flux at the observed @xmath25 band epochs and accounting for different lags .",
    "an example cross - correlation function ( ccf ) for a ten - year _ lsst _ survey , smoothed with a box - car kernel with a width of 6 days , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ccf ] .",
    "the ccf shows a distinct negative / anti - correlation peak at zero lag .",
    "this peak originates from the subtraction method discussed above . as such",
    ", it closely follows the auto - correlation functions of the bbb and @xmath65bbb light curves .",
    "after linearily - combining both acfs and scaling to the 0-lag negative peak , the bbb effect on the ccf can be effectively removed .    to recover the dust lag , the highest peak in the ccf after acf subtraction",
    "was automatically identified .",
    "a positive detection is considered if the peak ccf @xmath660.2 .",
    "an error region is defined as the range over which the ccf is at least half the peak ccf .",
    "the maximum ccf defines the time lag of the peak @xmath67 .",
    "a center - of - mass time lag @xmath68 is also determined at half the integrated ccf within the error region .    as a final remark ,",
    "a direct cross - correlation between the observed @xmath25 band and any optical band did not recover a time delay , although a corresponding peak is seen when cross - correlating the input model light curves .",
    "in addition , the `` shifted reference '' method by @xcite developed to recover time lags of the blr from photometric filters was not successful .",
    "this originates from the fact that the target signal does not vary with the same amplitude as the reference band and is significantly smeared , and may require the refinement presented in @xcite .",
    "the quality of lag recovery critically depends on the cadence as well as the continuity of observations .",
    "typically , objects will not be observable year - round . in order to simulate this effect , annual gaps of 2 , 4 , and 6 months were introduced for 1/6 , 1/3 , and 1/2 of the catalog , respectively . due to strong noise features for lags longer than @xmath35350days ,",
    "the ccf was analyzed only for lags @xmath37300days . in general , lags are detected for about 70% or more of all agn , independent of gap length . out of these lags ,",
    "about 80% are consistent within error bars with the sublimation radius of the input model .",
    "this is arguably a high rate given the simplicity of the lag recovery scheme and the completely blind analysis without any human interaction .",
    "the success rates might be boosted with more sophisticated methods and a way to deal with the longer lags .",
    "note that these numbers are strictly valid only for the specific agn sample parameters ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : simobs ] ) .",
    "there are some issues that merit further attention .",
    "the current simulations do not take into account contributions of broad lines .",
    "this should be a minor issue for the recovery of the bbb light curve given the multi - filter fitting scheme . however",
    ", broad components of paschen lines in the @xmath25-band may impose a secondary lag signal onto the dust light curve ( see * ? ? ? * for balmer lines ) . while their contribution is probably smaller than the dust contribution in this band ( see spectra in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they should be part of a more advanced recovery scheme ( see sect  [ sec : howto ] ) .",
    "furthermore , potential scattered light from the bbb ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the paschen continuum are also neglected , but their contribution to the total @xmath25-band flux is estimated to be of the order of 1% .",
    "the host flux has been neglected in the modeling ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : idea ] ) . based on the optical agn / host decomposition of @xcite , the contribution of the host to the total flux can reach 50% at @xmath69erg / s and will drop to @xmath3510% for @xmath70erg / s in the @xmath11-band . therefore ,",
    "if the host contribution was considered , the presented simulations would apply to a sample that is brighter by @xmath71 mag .",
    "radius - luminosity relations open up the possibility to use agn as `` standard candles '' in cosmology .",
    "such applications have been discussed for both the blr @xcite and the dust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "while the current agn reverberation sample is larger for the blr than for the hot dust , the proposed use of optical surveys may change this picture significantly .",

    "a broad emission line in the near - ir has only been successfully observed and resolved for one agn to - date ( 3c273 ; * ? ? ? * ) .    here , it is proposed that the dust time lags may also be used as a `` standard ruler '' in combination with directly measured near - ir angular sizes , @xmath91 , from interferometry to determine angular size distances @xmath90 , via the relation @xmath92 @xmath93 corrects the different sensitivities of the ccf and interferometry measurements to extended dust distributions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "as compared to the blr , the dust lags are about a factor of 4 longer ( comparing the @xmath94 relation in @xcite with the dust relation in @xcite ) , resulting in longer monitoring campaigns . on the other hand ,",
    "dust monitoring does not require spectroscopy or the use of specific narrow - band filters , but can be executed with any telescope that has broad - band filters and sufficient sensitivity .",
    "moreover , the hot - dust emission and sublimation radius are extremely uniform across agn , e.g. showing a narrow range of color temperatures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "<S> the time lag between optical and near - infrared ( ir ) flux variability can be taken as a means to determine the sublimation radius of the dusty `` torus '' around supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . </S>",

    "<S> optical _ survey telescopes , e.g. the _ large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) _ , can be used to measure dust sublimation radii as well . </S>",
    "<S> the method makes use of the fact that the wien tail of the hot dust emission reaches into the optical and can be reliably recovered with high - quality photometry . </S>",
    "<S> simulations show that dust sublimation radii for a large sample of agn can be reliably established out to redshift @xmath0 with the lsst . owing to the ubiquitous presence of agn up to high redshifts </S>",
    "<S> , they have been studies as cosmological probes . </S>",
    "<S> here , i discuss how optically - determined dust time lags fit into the suggestion of using the dust sublimation radius as a `` standard candle '' and propose and extension of the dust time lags as `` standard rulers '' in combination with ir interferometry . </S>"
