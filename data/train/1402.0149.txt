    "piezoelectricity is the ability of some materials to generate an electric field or electric potential in response to mechanical strain applied .",
    "the piezoelectric effect is reversible in that materials exhibiting the direct piezoelectric effect ( the production of an electric potential when stress is applied ) also exhibit the reverse piezoelectric effect ( the production of stress and/or strain when an electric field is applied ) .",
    "the effect is found useful in applications such as the production and detection of sound , generation of high voltages , electronic frequency generation , microbalances , and ultra fine focusing of optical assemblies .",
    "it is also the basis of a number of scientific instrumental techniques with atomic resolution , the scanning probe microscopies such as stm , afm , mta , snom , etc . , and everyday uses such as acting as the ignition source for cigarette lighters and push - start propane barbecues .",
    "moreover , the piezoelectric effect and the reverse piezoelectric effect can be reflected by the following two constitutive relationships respectively @xmath0 where @xmath1 is electric displacement , @xmath2 is permittivity , @xmath3 is electric field strength , @xmath4 is strain , @xmath5 is compliance and @xmath6 is stress , @xmath7 is piezoelectric constant .",
    "it is apparent that some composite materials could be designed so as to attain properties desired in industry . in this way",
    ", the best properties from each constituent phase within the composite may be utilized to create an improved material . in general , by replacing a portion of a piezoceramic with a lightweight , flexible , polymer , the resulting density , acoustic impedance , mechanical quality factor and dielectric constant can be decreased . if the phases can be arranged so the piezoelectric charge coefficients of the composite are maintained at reasonable levels , its voltage coefficients can be substantially improved . as a result , the merit of the piezocomposites can actually surpass those of single phase materials .",
    "therefore , according to aspects mentioned above , multi - scale modeling is necessary to describe the behavior of piezoelectric composites for the following two reasons . on one hand , in engineering , we are interested in relationship between micro - structure of the composite materials and macro - properties of the composite materials because in this way we can make the composite materials with desired macro - properties by controlling its micro - structure",
    "on the other hand , in numerical computation , the computation of the parameters describing a micro - nonhomogeneous medium is an extremely difficult task , since the coefficients of the corresponding differential equations are given by rapidly oscillating functions .",
    "many methods has been raised to get the multi - scale model , such as msfem , rve , hmm and etc .",
    "a number of work have been done in this field by former researchers .",

    "corresponding theoretical analysis is derived .",
    "differing from the elliptic equations whose solution is a minimum point of its energy functional , the solution of piezoelectric equations is a saddle point of its energy functional , which is caused by the coupling of mechanical field and electrical field .",
    "this difference brought main obstacle for theoretical analysis .",
    "we also deduced the macroscopic model from the microscopic model of piezoelectric composite material for materials with periodic microstructure and carried out the corresponding convergence analysis under the framework of homogenization .",
    "for the analysis of convergence , noticing that the regularity of the solutions of cell problems in the model can not reach @xmath9 , which makes the traditional treatment to this kind of problem not work on our problem . to solve this problem ,",
    "we employ two useful lemmas , whose original idea is from @xcite under the assumption that the regularity of solutions of cell problems in the model can reach @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , error estimate between hmm solutions and homogenization solutions is derived .",
    "a 3-d numerical example was given out to verify the error estimate .",

    ", we introduction the multi - scale problem of piezoelectric composite material briefly . in section 3 , a multi - scale model under the framework of hmm",
    "is designed . the macroscopic model from the microscopic model of piezoelectric composite material for materials with periodic microstructure is derived by asymptotic expansion in section 4 .",
    "we also give out the corresponding convergence analysis for the model we derived under the framework of homogenization in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "both error estimate between hmm solutions and homogenization solutions and error estimate of the effective coefficients is derived .",
