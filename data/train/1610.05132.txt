    "the magnetic moments of the nucleon ( proton and neutron ) are important structure constants and their understanding represents a challenge for any model or theory of the strong interactions .",
    "the measured values of the proton magnetic moment @xmath7 and the neutron magnetic moment @xmath8 , both given in units of the nuclear magneton @xmath9 , are extremely precise @xcite .",
    "the large anomalous magnetic moments @xmath10 and @xmath11 , describing the deviations from the values @xmath12 and @xmath13 of a charged and neutral dirac - particle , arise predominantely from the strong interactions in these composite three - quark systems .",
    "however , at the given experimental precision of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , their full - fledged values can not be attributed to the strong interactions alone , and electromagnetic effects ( or radiative corrections ) play also a substantial role . in the case of charged leptons a leading correction of @xmath14 is provided by the one - photon loop diagrams , calculated first by j. schwinger in 1948 . due to the ubiquitous prefactor @xmath0",
    ", one can expect that radiative corrections to the nucleon magnetic moments will similarly amount in magnitude to a few per mille .",
    "however , when deriving the analogous radiative corrections for nucleons one has to take into account that these composite objects possess an electromagnetic structure , preformed by the strong interaction , and that they are excitable into baryonic resonances .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide quantitative estimates for the radiative corrections to the nucleon magnetic moments based on parametrized nucleon form factors and a lorentz - covariant treatment of the low - lying spin-3/2 @xmath3-resonance .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section 3",
    "we calculate the one - photon loop diagrams of the vertex - correction and self - energy type with inclusion of phenomenological nucleon vector form factors .",
    "as prepared in section 2 , the radiative correction to the anomalous magnetic moment is extracted by a projection technique and after wick - rotation to euclidean momentum - space and angular integration one obtains a set of weight - functions .",
    "these serve to express the quantity of interest , @xmath15 , as a one - parameter integral over a quadratic form in the nucleon vector form factors .",
    "moreover , we verify that the inclusion of the wave - function renormalization factor @xmath16 from the ( electromagnetic ) self - energy diagram leads to an infrared - finite and gauge - invariant result .",
    "several parametrizations of the proton and neutron vector form factors are used to evaluate the integral - represention of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the calculation of the photon - loop diagrams with a single intermediate @xmath3-isobar .",
    "we employ common forms of the rarita - schwinger propagator and the @xmath19-vertex amended by a phenomenological transition form factor .",
    "section 5 deals with the mechanism , where a charged @xmath20-isobar propagates further inside the photon - loop after electromagnetic interaction , which is applicable only to the proton .",
    "the pertinent @xmath21-vertex is obtained by gauging the kinetic term of the free rarita - schwinger lagrangian . in section 6",
    "we study alternative forms of the rarita - schwinger propagator and the @xmath22-vertex , which incorporate the feature of projecting onto the spin-3/2 degrees of freedom .",
    "the results obtained with both lorentz - covariant treatments of the @xmath3-isobar may provide a range for the size of baryonic resonance contributions to the radiative corrections to the nucleon magnetic moments . finally , section 7 ends with a short summary and in the appendix expressions for the electromagnetic mass shifts are collected and discussed .",
    "let us start with recalling the form of the on - shell vector - vertex for a spin-1/2 nucleon of ( average ) mass @xmath23mev .",
    "imposing current - conservation and the usual discrete symmetries , the transition matrix - element @xmath24 reads : @xmath25 with the spin - tensor @xmath26 and the squared momentum - transfer @xmath27 .",
    "the superscript @xmath28 on the dirac and pauli form factors @xmath29 should indicate that @xmath30 arises from a photon - loop diagram . in order to extract the radiative correction to the magnetic moment",
    ", one has to project out first the loop - induced pauli form factor @xmath31 .",
    "this is achieved by multiplying @xmath30 with a suitable projection operator @xcite and taking the dirac - trace : @xmath32(\\gamma\\!\\cdot\\!p_2+m)\\big\\ } \\,.\\ ] ] in the next step the limit @xmath33 has to be performed with care before the four - dimensional integration over the loop - momentum @xmath34 . by choosing the breit - frame with @xmath35 and averaging over the directions of the ( small ) momentum - transfer @xmath36",
    ", one can effectively make the substitution : @xmath37 . during this procedure the momentum - sum @xmath38 is kept fixed . after setting @xmath39",
    ", the resulting loop - integrand depends only on @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "one performs a wick - rotation to euclidean momentum - space , @xmath42 , and sets @xmath43 with @xmath44 the cosine of the polar angle @xmath45 in four dimensions . by combining these steps , a loop - integral including the factor @xmath46 from a photon - propagator gets reduced to : @xmath47 = { m^2 \\over 4\\pi^3 } \\int_0^\\infty \\!\\!dx\\int_{-1}^1\\!\\ !",
    "dz\\,x\\ , \\sqrt{1-z^2}\\,\\big [ \\dots\\big]\\,,\\ ] ] where one has set the euclidean length to @xmath48 .",
    "the remaining terms @xmath49 $ ] of the loop - integrand depend rationally on @xmath50 , such that the angular integral can always be performed analytically .",
    "the outcome of the loop - calculation at this stage are @xmath51-dependent weight - functions .    in the following sections we apply these techniques to calculate the radiative corrections to the nucleon magnetic moments as they arise from photon - loop diagrams involving nucleons and @xmath3-isobars .",
    "the pertinent electromagnetic vertices are supplemented by phenomenological form factors which should represent the ( internal ) baryon structure .",
    "the triangular photon - loop diagram with intermediate nucleons is shown on the left in fig.1 .",
    "we evaluate it with three ( off - shell ) vector - vertices of the form @xmath30 in eq.(1 ) , where the form factors @xmath52 and @xmath53 refer to the nucleon structure arising from strong interactions . carrying out the calculational steps",
    "as outlined in section 2 , one arrives at the following ( partial ) result for the radiative correction to the nucleon magnetic moments : @xmath54f_1 ^ 2(xm)\\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\bigg[\\bigg({x^2(7 + 2x^2)\\over \\sqrt{4+x^2}}-3x-2x^3\\bigg)c + \\bigg(2x+3x^3-{x^2(8 + 3x^2)\\over\\sqrt{4 + x^2}}\\bigg){\\kappa \\over 8}\\bigg]f_1(xm)f_2(xm ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\bigg[\\bigg({x^2\\over \\sqrt{4+x^2}}(16+x^2-x^4)-8x-3x^3+x^5\\bigg ) { c \\over 8 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\bigg({x^2\\over\\sqrt{4+x^2}}(8 + 5x^2+x^4 ) -4x-3x^3-x^5\\bigg){\\kappa \\over 16 } \\bigg]f_2 ^ 2(xm)\\bigg\\}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath55 denote the charge and @xmath56 the anomalous magnetic moment of the proton and neutron , respectively . of course",
    ", in the end the third decimal place of @xmath57 should be changed in order to treat properly only the strong interaction part .",
    "@xmath58 denotes the usual fine - structure constant .",
    "it should be noted that the triangle diagram has been evaluated with a photon - propagator @xmath59 in feynman gauge .",
    "the integral @xmath60 over the first weight - function @xmath61 has the value @xmath62 , and this way one recovers the famous result @xmath63 of schwinger for a structureless spin-1/2 dirac - particle .",
    "the partial result in eq.(4 ) has an obvious problem in the form of the infrared - singular @xmath64-term in the weight - function multiplying @xmath65 .",
    "the only other diagrams available at order @xmath66 are those with a self - energy correction on an external nucleon line , shown on the right in fig.1 .",
    "their effect is to multiply the tree - level vector - vertex with the nucleon wave - function renormalization factor @xmath16 . in order to extract this quantity ,",
    "one decomposes the dirac self - energy @xmath67 into a scalar and a vector part : @xmath68 . by setting thereafter",
    "@xmath69 the wave - function renormalization factor @xmath16 is obtained as the derivative of @xmath70 with respect @xmath71 at @xmath72 .",
    "the electromagnetic mass - shift follows in a simpler way as : @xmath73 . after some calculation one arrives at the following expression for the wave - function renormalization factor @xmath16 from the self - energy subdiagram in fig.1 : @xmath74 f_1 ^ 2(xm)\\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\bigg[{x^2(16 + 5x^2)\\over 2\\sqrt{4+x^2 } } -3x-{5x^3\\over 2}\\bigg]f_1(xm)f_2(xm ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\bigg[{x^2\\over   8\\sqrt{4+x^2}}(16 + 2x^2-x^4)-x-{x^3\\over 2}+{x^5 \\over 8}\\bigg]f_2 ^ 2(xm ) \\bigg\\}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "one observes that in the combination @xmath75 the singular @xmath64-term drops out , and thus an infrared - finite radiative correction is achieved .",
    "moreover , one has to check gauge - invariance by working with a general photon - propagator : @xmath76 its @xmath77-dependent longitudinal part produces via the triangular photon - loop diagram a contribution : @xmath78 which gets exactly canceled by a contribution to the @xmath16-factor from the self - energy subdiagram : @xmath79 the infrared - finite and gauge - invariant total result @xmath80 from the photon - loop diagrams of vertex - correction and self - energy type in fig.1 reads finally : @xmath81f_1 ^ 2(xm)\\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\bigg[\\bigg({x^2(7 + 2x^2)\\over\\sqrt{4+x^2}}-3x-2x^3\\bigg)c + \\bigg({x^2(10 + 3x^2)\\over \\sqrt{4+x^2}}-4x-3x^3\\bigg){\\kappa \\over 2}\\bigg]f_1(xm)f_2(xm )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\bigg[\\bigg({x^2\\over \\sqrt{4+x^2}}(16+x^2-x^4)-8x- 3x^3+x^5\\bigg){c \\over 8 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\bigg({x^2\\over\\sqrt{4+x^2 } } ( 64 + 16x^2-x^4)-32x-18x^3+x^5\\bigg){\\kappa \\over 32 } \\bigg]f_2 ^ 2(xm ) \\bigg\\}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath82 the charges and @xmath83 the anomalous magnetic moments of nucleons .",
    "the numerical evaluation of the integral - formula in eq.(9 ) for the radiative correction to the nucleon magnetic moments requires as input the momentum - dependent form factors @xmath84 .",
    "the simplest @xmath85-dependence , which roughly reproduces the trend of the data , is a dipole parametrization of the electric and magnetic form factor @xcite : @xmath86 @xmath87 with @xmath88mev the empirical dipole mass .",
    "more elaborate parametrizations of the nucleon form factors are obtained in the dispersion relation analysis ( dra ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to the data from elastic electron - scattering , fits based on this method include the constraints from unitarity , analyticity and crossing symmetry as well as the qcd - asymptotics .",
    "we employ here the expressions for the isoscalar and isovector form factors @xmath89 given in appendix c of ref.@xcite . moreover , improved fits of the nucleon vector form factors have been obtained recently in refs.@xcite by including two - photon exchange corrections in the analysis of all available and updated elastic electron - proton scattering data .",
    "the fitted results for @xmath89 are presented in an analytical form as sums of vector - boson poles supplemented by rational parametrizations of the contributions from the isovectorial @xmath90-continuum @xcite .    in table1 numerical values for the radiative correction @xmath91 to the proton / neutron magnetic moment",
    "are listed .",
    "the three columns refer to the dipole parametrization ( dipole ) , the earlier fit @xcite using dispersion relations ( dra ) , and the most recent fit @xcite including @xmath92-exchange corrections ( ina ) .",
    "modulo some slight variations , the radiative correction @xmath93 to the proton magnetic moment is in magnitude about 2.5 times larger than @xmath94 for the neutron . in both cases",
    "the radiative corrections amount to about @xmath95 of the empirical magnetic moments @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "in order to illustrate how the numerical values in table1 have come about , we present in fig.2 the integrand for @xmath98 , without the small prefactor @xmath0 .",
    "one observes distributions that take on negative values for @xmath99 and peak around @xmath100 , corresponding to a momentum - transfer of @xmath101 ( with @xmath102mev the dipole mass ) .",
    "the fast transition from positive to negative values has its origin in the six @xmath51-dependent weight - functions entering eq.(9 ) , where all exept the first one are negative functions .",
    "the upper full curve in fig.2 ( with total area @xmath62 under it ) shows the different situation for the radiative correction to the magnetic moment of a ( structureless ) lepton .",
    "likewise , the integrand for @xmath103 ( without the factor @xmath0 ) is displayed in fig.3 . in this case essentially only the term in the last line of eq.(9 ) contributes .",
    "since a negative weight - function gets multiplied by @xmath97 , one obtains a positive integrand and a positive radiative correction of @xmath104 .    at this point",
    "one can draw the interesting conclusion that the large anomalous magnetic moments @xmath57 of nucleons , predetermined by the strong interaction , change the sign of the leading radiative correction proportional to @xmath0 in comparison to pointlike leptons .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     _ tab.3 : radiative corrections to the proton and neutron magnetic moments arising from @xmath105 triangle - diagrams using with the second vertex .",
    "_    table 3 gives the corresponding numerical values of @xmath98 and @xmath98 for the three choices ( dipole , dra , ina ) of the nucleon vector form factors @xmath106 . in comparison to the first @xmath4-vertex ,",
    "one obtains singificantly reduced values of @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "this reduction becomes also obvious from the underlying integrands which are shown by the dashed lines in fig.5 .",
    "the differences between the full and dashed lines are suggestive of spurious spin-1/2 degrees of freedom in the rarita - schwinger spinor .",
    "next we have to reevaluate with the new vertex @xmath109 the wave - function renormalization factor @xmath110 arising from the self - energy subdiagram in fig.6 .",
    "independent of the choice of the @xmath111-isobar propagator this quantity is now given by the expression : @xmath112\\bigg\\}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding integrand ( without the factor @xmath0 ) is shown by the dashed line in fig.7 .",
    "the apparent enhancement by a factor of about @xmath113 translates into more sizeable corrections of opposite sign : @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "finally , we have to reevaluate the @xmath21 loop - diagram in fig.6 with the new vertex @xmath109 . in this case",
    "the result for the radiatively induced magnetic moment of the proton depends on the choice the @xmath111-isobar propagator . using the not spin-3/2 projected version in eq.(13 ) , one gets the expression : @xmath116\\bigg\\}\\,,\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which gives the numerical value @xmath117 .",
    "the corresponding integrand is shown by the dashed - dotted line in fig.8 .",
    "on the other hand the spin-3/2 projected version in eq.(20 ) leads to a somewhat different expression : @xmath118\\bigg\\}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which yields a significantly smaller numerical value of @xmath119 .",
    "this feature is also indicated by the dashed line in fig.8 for the respective integrand .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the last case only the quasi - dirac part @xmath120 of the @xmath121-coupling has contributed . for",
    "the spin-3/2 projected vertex and propagator the terms involving intermediate @xmath3-isobars sum up to @xmath122 and @xmath123 . together with the purely nucleonic loop - contributions from section3 these yield then estimates for the radiative corrections of : @xmath124 which are ( unfortunately ) quite different from the first estimate given in eq.(19 ) .",
    "in this work we have estimated the radiative corrections of order @xmath0 to the magnetic moments of the proton and neutron .",
    "the schwinger calculation for a structureless lepton has been adapted to extended nucleons by including phenomenological vector form factors .",
    "the resulting expression for @xmath125 is infrared - finite and gauge - invariant and yields numerical values of @xmath126 and @xmath127 , using updated parametrizations for the nucleon form factors @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , we have also studied the effects of photon - loops involving the low - lying @xmath3-resonance . for the pertinent calculation",
    "a lorentz - covariant treatment of massive spin-3/2 particles is mandatory .",
    "the two ( minimal ) versions of the @xmath105-vertex amended by a phenomenological transition form factor @xmath128 , that we have examined in combination with costumary form of the spin-3/2 propagator , yield radiative corrections of @xmath129 and @xmath130 , respectively .",
    "the differences are quite substantial and therefore one may hope that an extended form of the @xmath131 transition amplitude ( with further coupling constants and off - shell parameters ) will lead to radiatively induced nucleon magnetic moments that are more consistent for conventional and spin-3/2 projected vertices and propagators .",
