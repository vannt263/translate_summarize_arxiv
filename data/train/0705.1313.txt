    "with the increasing availability of radioactive ion - beams  @xcite the study of structure and reactions of exotic nuclei has become feasible  @xcite . in particular , detailed investigations of the fusion process",
    "are crucial for the prediction of heavy - element formation and will lead to a better understanding of the interplay among the strong , coulomb , and weak interactions as well as the enhanced correlations present in these many - body systems .",
    "recently , particular attention has been given to the @xmath0ni+@xmath1sn system , where a large sub - barrier fusion enhancement was observed  @xcite .",
    "for this system fusion cross sections were measured in the energy range 142  mev  @xmath2  195  mev .",
    "in particular , it was found that fission is negligible for @xmath3  160  mev and therefore the evaporation residue cross sections have been taken as fusion cross sections .",
    "the enhancement of sub - barrier fusion was originally deduced from comparison with a barrier penetration calculation , using a phenomenological woods - saxon interaction potential whose parameters were fitted to reproduce the evaporation residue cross sections for the @xmath0ni+@xmath4sn system  @xcite .",
    "similarly , early coupled - channel calculations , which are known to enhance the fusion cross sections by considering coupling to various excitation channels and neutron transfer , have significantly underestimated the low energy fusion cross sections for the @xmath0ni+@xmath1sn system  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , more sophisticated coupled - channel calculations lead to an improvement for the description of the lower energy data . finally , the inclusion of the neutron transfer channels with positive @xmath5 value in addition to inelastic excitations resulted in the best description to date  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical analysis of the fusion data generally involves determination of a phenomenological ion - ion potential such as the bass model  @xcite , the proximity potential  @xcite , or potentials obtained via the double - folding method  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the actual fusion cross section is calculated by either using barrier penetration models  @xcite , or the coupled - channel method  @xcite .",
    "the latter includes various excitations of the target and/or projectile using the coupled - channel formalism  @xcite , as well as the inclusion of neutron transfer , and can be consistently applied at energies above and below the barrier  @xcite .",
    "effectively , the inclusion of each additional excitation leads to a modification of the original inert core ion - ion potential , resulting in a series of effective barriers .",
    "one common physical assumption used in many of these calculations is the use of the frozen density or the sudden approximation . in this approximation",
    "the nuclear densities are unchanged during the computation of the ion - ion potential as a function of the internuclear distance .",
    "furthermore , the effects included in channel couplings are usually based on the static properties of the participating nuclei , which may accurately represent the early stages of the collision process , but are expected to change as the two ions strongly interact . while these methods provide a useful and productive means for quantifying multitudinous reaction data it is desirable to include dynamical effects and make contact with the microscopic theories of nuclear structure and reactions .",
    "recently , we have developed a new approach for calculating heavy - ion interaction potentials which incorporates all of the dynamical entrance channel effects included in the time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) description of the collision process  @xcite .",
    "these effects include the neck formation , particle exchange , internal excitations , and deformation effects to all order , as well as the effect of nuclear alignment for deformed systems .",
    "the method is based on the tdhf evolution of the nuclear system coupled with density - constrained hartree - fock calculations to obtain the ion - ion interaction potential .",
    "preliminary calculations for the @xmath0ni+@xmath1sn system highlighted the importance of dynamical deformation effects  @xcite .",
    "here we give a completed study of fusion cross sections using this formalism .    in the next section",
    "we will summarize some theoretical aspects of the density constrained tdhf theory along with methods to incorporate dynamical alignment into our calculations , as well as the method used the calculate cross sections from the resulting barriers . in section  [ sec : results ] we present interesting aspects of the reaction dynamics and compare our results with experiment and other calculations .",
    "in this subsection we give a qualitative description of the density constrained tdhf method which is used to obtain the dynamical barriers for the @xmath0ni+@xmath1sn system .",
    "further details of the method can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the _ density constraint _ is a novel numerical method that was developed in the mid 1980 s  @xcite and was used to provide a microscopic description of the formation of shape resonances in light systems  @xcite . in this approach",
    "the tdhf time - evolution takes place with no restrictions . at certain times during the evolution the instantaneous density is used to perform a static hartree - fock minimization while holding the total density constrained to be the instantaneous tdhf density .",
    "in essence , this provides us with the tdhf dynamical path in relation to the multi - dimensional static energy surface of the combined nuclear system .",
    "since we are constraining the total density all moments are simultaneously constrained . the numerical procedure for implementing this constraint and the method for steering the solution to @xmath6",
    "is discussed in refs .",
    "the convergence property is as good if not better than in the traditional constrained hartree - fock calculations with a constraint on a single collective degree of freedom .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that the ion - ion interaction potential is simply given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the density constrained energy at the instantaneous separation @xmath9 , while @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the binding energies of the two nuclei obtained with the same effective interaction .",
    "we would like to emphasize again that this procedure does not affect the tdhf time - evolution and contains no _ free parameters _ or _ normalization_. in practice , tdhf runs are initialized with energies above the coulomb barrier and in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that there is no appreciable energy dependence to the barriers obtained via the density constrained tdhf method .",
    "a detailed description of our new three - dimensional unrestricted tdhf code has recently been published in ref .  @xcite . for the effective interaction",
    "we have used the skyrme sly5 force  @xcite including all of the time - odd terms .      in general , the fusion cross sections depend on the interaction potential and form factors in the vicinity of the coulomb barrier .",
    "these are expected to be modified during the collision due to dynamical effects .",
    "in addition , experiments on sub - barrier fusion have demonstrated a strong dependence of the total fusion cross section on nuclear deformation  @xcite .",
    "the dependence on nuclear orientation has received particular attention for the formation of heavy and superheavy elements  @xcite and various entrance channel models have been developed to predict its role in enhancing or diminishing the probability for fusion  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have developed a new approach for calculating the effect of nuclear alignment for deformed systems  @xcite .",
    "in essence , the procedure for incorporating alignment into the evolution of the heavy - ion collision dynamics is done in two separate steps : a ) a dynamical coulomb alignment calculation to determine the probability that a given nuclear orientation occurs at the distance @xmath12 , where the tdhf run is initialized .",
    "the alignment generally results from multiple _ e2_/_e4 _ coulomb excitation of the ground state rotational band .",
    "the distance @xmath12 is chosen such that the nuclei only interact via the coulomb interaction .",
    "b ) a tdhf calculation , starting at this finite internuclear distance @xmath12 , for a fixed initial orientation of the deformed nucleus . since the experiments are usually done with unpolarized beams , in a full quantum mechanical calculation one would have to average over discrete quantum mechanical rotational bands . in the classical limit , this corresponds to averaging over orientation angles .",
    "a general study of taking the classical limit of the relative nuclear motion during a heavy - ion collision which includes inelastic excitations of one of the heavy ions in the entrance channel has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the heavy - ion interaction potential between two deformed nuclei depends on the distance vector between their centers - of - mass , @xmath13 , and on the relative orientation of their intrinsic principal axis systems which may be described in terms of three euler angles @xmath14 per nucleus , i.e. in the most general case we have @xmath15 explicit expressions for this interaction potential within the double - folding method are given in ref .",
    "the expression for @xmath16 can be simplified if the intrinsic nuclear density distributions are axially symmetric ; in this case , the potential does not depend on the euler angles @xmath17 which describe rotations about the symmetry axes . if we put , for convenience , the distance vector in @xmath18-direction , @xmath19 , the potential between two deformed axially symmetric nuclei has the structure @xmath20 finally , if one of the nuclei is spherical , e.g. nucleus ( 1 ) , the potential is simply given by @xmath21 where the euler angle @xmath22 describes the direction of the nuclear symmetry axis relative to the internuclear distance vector .",
    "details of the dynamic alignment formalism are presented in  @xcite .",
    "we give here a brief summary : for a given incident energy @xmath23 we carry out a semiclassical coulomb excitation calculation of the dominant collective levels of the deformed nucleus .",
    "the energy levels and @xmath24-transition matrix elements for @xmath0ni are taken from experimental data @xcite :  @xmath25  mev , @xmath26  mev and @xmath27@xmath28  ( oblate deformation ) .",
    "the coulomb excitation calculation starts at very large internuclear distances ( about @xmath29  fm ) when both nuclei may be presumed to be in their respective ground states and stops at the ion - ion separation distance @xmath12 ( about @xmath30  fm ) .",
    "the coulomb excitation amplitudes determine the probability distribution of initial orientations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : align_ni_sn ] we show the differential alignment probability as a function of the euler angle @xmath31 used in our calculations .     dynamic alignment due to coulomb excitation of @xmath0ni .",

    "we have adopted the commonly used _ incoming wave boundary condition _ ( iwbc ) method  @xcite .",
    "once the ion - ion potential for a particular orientation , @xmath38 , is calculated the two - body schrdinger equation becomes @xmath39 \\psi_l(r,\\beta)=0\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the reduced mass and @xmath41 denotes orbital angular momentum .",
    "iwbc assumes that once the minimum of the potential is reached fusion will occur , consequently no imaginary part of the potential is needed . in practice ,",
    "the schrdinger equation is integrated from the potential minimum , @xmath42 , where only an incoming wave is assumed , to a large asymptotic distance , where it is matched to incoming and outgoing coulomb wavefunctions to obtain the penetration factor , @xmath43 , as the ratio of the incoming flux at @xmath42 to the incoming coulomb flux at large distance .",
    "the total cross section is given by @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "for the numerical implementation we have followed the procedure for the coupled - channel code ccful described in ref .",
    "@xcite and exactly reproduced their results for an inert - core potential .",
    "we have carried out a number of tdhf calculations with accompanying density constraint calculations to compute @xmath38 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : vr ] ) .",
    "a detailed description of our new three - dimensional unrestricted tdhf code has recently been published in ref  @xcite . for the effective interaction",
    "we have used the skyrme sly5 force  @xcite including all of the time - odd terms .",
    "the code was modified to self - consistently generate initial states for @xmath0ni with different orientations .",
    "all of our tdhf calculations were done at an initial energy of @xmath46  mev and separation @xmath47  fm . as we have reported in ref .",
    "@xcite the potential barriers obtained from the density constrained tdhf method are not sensitive to the initial energy ( above the barrier ) .",
    "we have tested this again by running a few orientations at @xmath48  mev and @xmath49  mev and did not observe any appreciable difference .      in a tdhf collision leading to fusion the relative kinetic energy in the entrance channel",
    "is entirely converted into internal excitations of a single well defined compound nucleus . in tdhf theory the dissipation of the relative kinetic energy into internal excitations is due to the collisions of the nucleons with the `` walls '' of the self - consistent mean - field potential .",
    "tdhf studies demonstrate that the randomization of the single - particle motion occurs through repeated exchange of nucleons from one nucleus into the other .",
    "consequently , the equilibration of excitations is very slow , and it is sensitive to the details of the shape evolution of the composite system .",
    "this is in contrast to most classical pictures of nuclear fusion , which generally assume near instantaneous , isotropic equilibration .",

    "recently , the importance of transfer of neutrons with positive @xmath5 value in fusion has been emphasized  @xcite . in tdhf",
    "this effect manifests itself as the excitation of the pre - compound collective dipole mode , which is likely when ions have significantly different @xmath51 ratio , and is a reflection of dynamical charge equilibration . in fig .",

    "while the above analysis provides a picture of particle exchange dynamics over time it is also possible to examine particle exchange during the initial stages of the collision , namely from the well separated nuclei to the time when the minimum separation is reached . in fig .",
    "[ fig : left ] we show the neutron and proton transfer to the left fragment , which in our case is initially @xmath0ni . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : left ] the number of neutrons and protons increase for the left fragment as the ions come into contact . as expected the transfer of neutrons starts earlier since they are dominant in the surface region . for small @xmath61 values",
    "the increase is simply due to charge equilibration as the two nuclei have a substantial overlap .",
    "however , at a separation of @xmath62  fm , which corresponds approximately to the top of the potential barrier as discussed in the next subsection , we have about two neutrons transferred , and at @xmath63  fm we have as many as six neutrons transferred .",
    "it is also interesting to observe that the large transfers in the early stages of the collision happen quickly , indicated by the sudden jumps in neutron number .",

    "@xcite without channel couplings , having a barrier height of @xmath67  mev and location of the barrier peak at approximately @xmath68  fm .",
    "the difference for smaller @xmath61 values is due to the use of the point coulomb interaction in the model calculation , which is unphysical when nuclei overlap . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vrb ] for higher @xmath31 values the barrier is lowered and the barrier peak moves to larger @xmath61 values , with the lowest barrier having a height of @xmath69  mev and peaking around @xmath70  fm .",
    "the physical picture which emerges from these calculations is that for all energies above @xmath69  mev , which is the peak of the lowest barrier , the fusion cross section will be dominated by lower barriers as the cross section above the barrier is substantially larger than sub - barrier cross sections . in other words",
    "the only experimental data point that appears to be truly sub - barrier is the lowest energy point at @xmath71  mev .",

    "the ratio starts from unity at large distances and increases as @xmath61 gets smaller and as the ions pass the top of the barrier as indicated by the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : eff ] .",
    "this is due to the fact that the relative velocity , @xmath73 , becomes small as the ions begin to overlap substantially , while the numerator of eq .",
    "[ eq : eff ] remains non - zero since the energy is above the barrier .",

    "in addition to the effective mass it also possible to calculate the dynamical reduced mass .",
    "it is well known that the naive formula for reduced mass given by @xmath76 does not correctly represent the dynamical behavior of this quantity , monotonically increasing from its asymptotic value to the predictable final value when @xmath77 , i.e. a composite has been formed and half the mass is in the right half and other half on the left half of the numerical box . an alternative way to calculate the dynamical reduced mass",

    "@xcite . here",
    "the dynamical centers and momenta for the left and right halves are calculated via @xmath78 where the index @xmath79 denotes left and right halves .",

    "this quantity is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mur ] along with the naive expression , @xmath83 .",
    "while we observe interesting structure in @xmath84 the overall change in the magnitude around the barrier region is not large enough to substantially alter the fusion cross sections .",

    "[ fig : eff ] where we have also plotted the ratio of the effective mass to the dynamical reduced mass ( dashed curve ) .",

    "we have also included the dynamical effective mass by making the well known coordinate scale transformation  @xcite @xmath87 as a result of this transformation all of the effects of the dynamical effective mass are transferred to the scaled potential while the reduced mass @xmath40 remains constant at its asymptotic value .",

    "the resulting cross sections are shown by the black curve in fig .",

    "on the other hand such a large value for the cross section is more consistent with an above the barrier or very close to the top of the barrier energy .",

    "lead to substantial modification of the naive potential barrier calculations which assume an inert core and no dynamics .",
    "consequently , the definition of _ sub - barrier _ fusion becomes ambiguous since it is difficult to determine the barrier a priori .",
