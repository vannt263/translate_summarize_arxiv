    "a lot of theoretical studies@xcite have been done on the subject of ideal free quantum gases even before the experimental observation of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) and fermi degeneracy .",
    "but , this subject drew more attention after it had been possible to detect bec@xcite and fermi degeneracy@xcite experimentally in trapped quantum gases .",
    "since then , an increasing attraction is noticed in the subject of trapped quantum gases .",
    "although a lot of theoretical studies@xcite are done on quantum gases trapped under generic power law potential , @xmath0 , none of these contained detailed discussion on energy fluctuation @xmath2 , until the recent paper of biswas et .",
    "al.@xcite where they discussed the energy fluctuation for free and harmonically trapped quantum gases in three dimensional space . in their paper",
    "they have also conjectured a relation between discontinuity of @xmath3 and energy fluctuation @xmath2 , suggesting the appearance of a hump in @xmath4 over its classical limit does indicate a discontinuity of @xmath3 .",
    "it was also reported in their study that , there is no hump in @xmath4 , in the case of free and harmonically trapped ideal fermi gases . in their recent paper , mehedi et .",
    "al . has proved the conjecture and investigated energy fluctuation@xcite in details for ideal bose gas trapped under generic power law potential in arbitrary dimension .",
    "point to note that , biswas et .",
    "al . calculated the @xmath2 for three dimensional free and harmonically trapped quantum gases , but @xmath2 is still not examined in arbitrary dimension while fermi gas is trapped under generic power law potential .",
    "+   + in this paper we investigate the @xmath2 of ideal fermi gases trapped under generic power law potential @xmath0 in @xmath5 dimension . at first",
    "we determine the density of states , which enables us to calculate the energy fluctuation using the fermi distribution function .",
    "later , we scrutinize the energy fluctuation in the quantum degenerate limit using the sommerfeld expansion . the dependence of energy fluctuation on dimensionality and power law exponents are visited in detail .",
    "interestingly our more general final result of energy fluctuation can exactly reproduce the same result in three dimension , for free and harmonically trapped fermi gases reported in biswas et .",
    "@xcite by choosing @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( free fermi gas in three dimension ) and @xmath6 , @xmath8 ( harmonically trapped fermi gas in three dimension ) .",
    "considering an ideal gas trapped under a generic power law potential in @xmath5 dimensional space with a single particle hamiltonian@xcite , @xmath9 where , @xmath10 is the momentum and @xmath11 is the @xmath12 th component of coordinate of a particle and @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are defined as all positive constants . here , @xmath16 , @xmath15 , @xmath17",
    "determine the depth and confinement power of the potential and @xmath18 being the kinematic parameter , where @xmath19 .",
    "as @xmath20 , the potential term goes to zero as all @xmath21 .",
    "we can construct our usual non - relativistic hamiltonian with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the density of states for such system is @xcite , @xmath24 where , @xmath25 is a constant depending on effective volume @xmath26@xcite and @xmath27 .",
    "now the fermi distribution function , is given by @xmath28 + where , @xmath29 is fugacity .",
    "so , the energy fluctuation of trapped fermi gas , @xmath30   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath31 is the fermi function defined as , @xmath32",
    "at low temperature , we can approximate the fermi function and write it as quickly convergent sommerfeld series@xcite @xmath33\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from ref.@xcite we can write the chemical potential ( fugacity ) as below , @xmath34 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the expression of fermi energy for fermi gas trapped under generic power law potential can be found in ref .",
    "so , using the sommerfeld approximation we can re - write the energy fluctuation from eq . ( 4 ) , @xmath35 again using of eq .",
    "( 7 ) , the energy fluctuation becomes @xmath36 where , @xmath37 . at @xmath38 ,",
    "the energy fluctuation becomes , @xmath39 in the case of ideal free fermi gas in three dimensional space , @xmath40 .",
    "so , from eq .",
    "( 4 ) we see @xmath2 becomes , @xmath41 and when the ideal fermi gas is trapped under a harmonic potential in three dimension , ( @xmath42 ) @xmath43 equation ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) coincides exactly with biswas et .",
    "in this section we summarize the interesting findings relating energy fluctuation of ideal fermi gas trapped under generic power law potential .",
    "+   +     +   + it is seen in the studies that@xcite , all the thermodynamic quantities of free fermi ( bose ) gases can be presented in terms of fermi function ( bose function ) depending on dimensionality @xmath5 .",
    "now , the thermodynamic quantities of trapped fermi ( bose ) gases can still be written in terms of fermi function ( bose function ) , using the concept of effective volume and effective thermal wavelength@xcite .",
    "but in this case the fermi ( bose ) functions depend on @xmath27 .",
    "so , at first we explore the dependence of energy fluctuation on @xmath37 , with varying @xmath44 ( figure 1 ) . here , all @xmath21 correspond to free system@xcite .",
    "it is very enthralling to point out that , the energy fluctuation is non - zero at @xmath45 for any value of @xmath44 , unlike the bose gas for which the    the energy fluctuation is zero at @xmath45 for any value of @xmath44@xcite .",
    "but , interesingly , it is clear from the figure 1 that , the value of energy fluctuation at @xmath45 , changes with varying @xmath44 .",
    "we will explore this phenomena in detail , later .",
    "but , no hump is noted in the energy fluctuation of fermi gas , unlike the bose gas .",
    "this result is in agreement with biswas et .",
    "+   + it has already been reported , within the canonical ensemble that , energy fluctuation @xmath46 is related to specific heat @xmath3 as @xmath47 . and in the case of grand canonical ensemble this is true for ideal classical gas@xcite only .",
    "@xcite , shows how the non zero fugacity of quantum gas causes this relation to remain invalid for quantum system .",
    "now the quantum gases behave as a classical gas in the high temperature limit and thus tend to maintain this relation at high temperature .",
    "so , the status of this relation to be invalid is very important in low temprature limit .",
    "the low temperature limit of bose gas corresponds to condensed phase . and",
    "the status of this relation has already been checked for bose system by mehedi et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "and it can be checked for trapped fermi gas in the degenerate limit with the help of eq .",
    "( 9 ) , which depicts the energy fluctuation of trapped fermi gas changes as @xmath48 , while @xmath3 changes as @xmath49@xcite , where @xmath50 , @xmath51 are functions of @xmath44 .",
    "the temperature dependency of @xmath46 and @xmath3 explicitly shows , how @xmath47 relation is not maintained in low temperature limit of trapped fermi gas .",
    "+   + let us further analyse the energy fluctuation in different space dimensions . in figure 2",
    "we have set the condition of symmetric potential i.e. @xmath52 .",
    "the non zero energy fluctuation at @xmath45 is visible in all the figures . but",
    "this non zero value of energy fluctuation at @xmath45 , @xmath53 changes with different trapping potential . to be more specific , @xmath53 decreases with decreasing value of @xmath54 .",
    "when all @xmath55 ( free system ) @xmath53 has the highest value and this value reduces as we decrease @xmath54 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "one can also find out from figure 2 ( a)-(c ) that , @xmath53 also changes with dimensionality . in order to see this in detail",
    "we have done a separate plot . nevertheless , the influence of trapping potential is observed not only at @xmath45 but also in the whole temperature range for any dimensionality .",
    "+   +    in figure 3 , we analyse the change of @xmath53 with respect to dimensionality , for different types of trapping potential .",
    "it is seen from the figure that , for free fermi system the @xmath53 is maximum near @xmath56 .",
    "but this situation changes while the fermi system is trapped , as a shift is noticed in the maximum of @xmath53 .",
    "another important point to notice from figure 3 that , the maximum of @xmath53 can be obtained in different dimensionality ( depends on the trapping potential ) , but the maximum value of @xmath53 remains the same for all .",
    "this figure is very significant , as from it one can predict which trapping potential will cause maximum of energy fluctuation at @xmath45 for any specific dimensionality .",
    "in this manuscript we have restricted our discussion for ideal nonrelativistic fermi gases .",
    "our general result on energy fluctuation of ideal fermi gas trapped under generic power law potential in arbitrary dimension can reproduce exactly the same result in three dimension@xcite but , it will be interesting to calculate energy fluctuation for interacting fermions , which is not yet done . interaction might change the dependence of energy fluctuation on trapping potential . however",
