    "the study of supernova remnants ( snrs ) is of great interest in astrophysics ( see @xcite and references therein for a recent review ) .",
    "snrs provide valuable information relevant to stellar evolution , the evolution of the galaxy and its interstellar medium .",
    "snrs are the dominant source of kinetic energy input into the interstellar medium .",
    "snrs are observed primarily in x - rays , by emission from hot interior gas with temperature @xmath01 kev , and in radio , by synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons accelerated by the snr shockwave .",
    "the observational constraints for different snrs are often different in nature .",
    "they depend on the brightness of emissions in different wavebands by a given snr and by the instruments used to observe that snr .",
    "only a small fraction of the @xmath0300 observed snrs in our galaxy have been well enough characterized to determine their evolutionary state , including explosion type , explosion energy and age . in order to expedite characterization of snrs",
    ", we present a set of snr models and a software implementation in python .",
    "the set of models consists of a wide set of models constructed previously by other authors ( details given below ) .",
    "we carry out the additional step of consistently joining different stages of evolution , which in many cases has not been done before .",
    "the resulting software facilitates the process of using different constraints from observations to obtain snr physical properties of interest .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 presents an overview of supernova remnant evolution .",
    "section 3.1 describes some of the overall properties related to calculation of snr models , such as characteristic time and radius scales and electron - ion temperature equilibration .",
    "section 3.2 describes the calculations for the standard evolutionary path of a snr .",
    "section 3.3 describes alternate evolutionary paths , including cases of snr in a cloudy ism , the fractional energy loss model for snr , and snr evolution in a hot low - density ism .",
    "section 3.4 briefly describes the software .",
    "section 4 gives results from example calculations done with the software and section 5 gives a brief summary .",
    "a supernova ( sn ) explosion creates a snr starting with the ejection of the sn progenitor envelope at high speed , typically 5000 - 10000 km / s .",
    "general descriptions of snr evolution are given in numerous places ( e.g. see @xcite and @xcite , hereafter referred to as tm99 ) .",
    "in the case where a compact remnant is formed , the envelope is the progenitor less the core that becomes the remnant . in the case of no remnant , such as for thermonuclear type ia explosions ,",
    "the ejected mass ( envelope ) is the entire sn progenitor .",
    "the high - speed ejecta interacts with the surrounding gas ( circumstellar medium , csm , or interstellar medium , ism ) creating a shock front at its outer edge .",
    "the csm is the nearby surrounding gas affected by the progenitor star , whereas the ism is more generally the large - scale gas between the stars .",
    "the general picture of snr evolution is an initial ejecta - dominated ( ed ) stage , in which the effect of the ejected mass and explosion energy are both important .",
    "this evolves into a sedov - taylor ( st ) phase , where only the explosion energy remains important because the mass swept up by the sn shock exceeds the ejected mass . for ed and",
    "st phases , radiative energy losses by the hot shocked interior are negligible .",
    "as the snr becomes older , radiative losses become more important until the post - shock pressure becomes significantly reduced .",
    "this causes formation of a dense cool shell just behind the shock front .",
    "however , the hot low density interior is unaffected by energy losses so the snr is driven by the interior pressure acting on the dense shell .",
    "the snr is then in the pressure driven snowplow ( pds ) phase . during the entire evolution",
    "the outer shock front is slowing down with time . during the pds phase",
    ", it can slow down enough that it is not distinguishable from random motions in the ism .",
    "this is the termination ( or merger ) of the snr with the ism . in some ( rare ) cases",
    ", the snr can lose its interior pressure before merger , resulting in an additional phase , where the dense shell coasts outward , conserving momentum .",
    "this phase is called the momentum - conserving shell ( mcs ) stage .",
    "the unshocked part of the ejected envelope has a homologous velocity profile ( @xmath1 at fixed time ) .",
    "the outer edge interacts in the form of a shock structure with the csm or ism ( hereafter , we use the term csm , but whether the surrounding gas is csm or ism depends on the particular situation of the progenitor and distance of the shock from the sn ) . from outside to inside , this shock structure consists of : the undisturbed csm , the outer shock moving into the csm , a layer of shocked csm , the contact discontinuity separating the shocked csm from the shocked envelope , the layer of shocked envelope , the inner ( or reverse ) shock moving inward relative to the ejecta , and the undisturbed ejecta .",
    "after the reverse shock reaches the center of the snr , the entire ejecta is fully shocked .",
    "reflected shocks and sound waves are generated at this time , and die out over time ( e.g. see cmb88 ) .",
    "these are perturbations on the overall structure and are ignored in the models here ( and the analytic models in cmb88 and tm99 ) .",
    "we assume that the structure is spherically symmetric so that it depends only and radius and time . the pre - shock external medium ( csm )",
    "is assumed to have constant density or a @xmath2 density profile centered on the sn .",
    "the latter is appropriate for a stellar wind with steady mass loss rate .",
    "thus the csm density is a power - law @xmath3 , with s=0 ( constant density medium ) or s=2 ( stellar wind density profile ) .",
    "the unshocked ejecta is taken to have a power - law density profile @xmath4 .    with these assumptions",
    "the evolution of the forward and reverse shock has been calculated for the ed through st phases ( tm99 ) .",
    "the early part of the ed phase follows a self - similar evolution , calculated by @xcite .",
    "we used the tm99 analytic solutions for our modelling software , with some additional features as described below .",
    "there is no smooth transition from the s=2 ed and st phases to the later radiative phases ( e.g. tm99 ) .",
    "thus we consider the later phases only for the s=0 case .",
    "for the radiative phases we follow the treatment of cmb88 , but modify their solutions to be consistent with the earlier ed to st evolution .",
    "we also consider some alternate models for snr evolution which include additional physical effects .",
    "in particular , we include models for a snr in cloudy ism of @xcite ( hereafter wl91 ) , the constant energy loss model of @xcite ( hereafter lk2000 ) , and the model for snr in hot ism of @xcite ( hereafter tw2005 ) .",
    "the number density of electrons is @xmath5 , of hydrogen nuclei is @xmath6 , and of total number of ions is @xmath7 .",
    "then the total mass density is given by @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 is the mean mass per electron , @xmath10 is the mean mass per hydrogen nucleus , @xmath11 is the mean mass per ion and @xmath12 is the mean mass per particle ( with @xmath13 is the total number of particles ) .",
    "as discussed in tm99 , non - radiative supernova remnants undergo a unified evolution . the characteristic radius and time , for snr in a uniform ism ,",
    "are given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 with @xmath16 the ejected mass and @xmath17 the explosion energy .",
    "@xmath18 is the mass density of the ism , @xmath19 , where the ambient ism hydrogen number density is @xmath20 this gives characteristic velocity @xmath21 and characteristic shock temperature @xmath22 .",
    "for snr in a circumstellar medium with @xmath23 , s=2 , the characteristic radius and time are given by @xmath24 and @xmath25 , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 the wind mass loss rate and velocity , and @xmath28 .",
    "radiative losses gradually become important ( see cmb88 for details ) .",
    "the first parcel of snr interior gas to cool completely defines the time of thin shell formation @xmath29 . somewhat prior to @xmath29 , at @xmath30 , cooling causes the postshock fluid velocity to approach the shock velocity and the pressure - driven - snowplow ( pds ) phase begins .",
    "we use the standard cooling function @xmath31 erg @xmath32 s@xmath33 with @xmath34 the metallicity factor .",
    "this gives the same @xmath29 as in cmb88 , i.e. @xmath35 yr . following cmb88 , we define @xmath36 .",
    "a snr is considered to merge with the ism when the shock speed is not significantly larger than the ambient thermal sound speed or larger than typical turbulent velocities in the ism .",
    "the thermal sound speed is @xmath37 with @xmath38 the adiabatic index , here taken as 5/3 , and @xmath39 the ambient ism temperature .",
    "the turbulent velocity dispersion is taken as @xmath40 .",
    "thus merger is defined when the snr shock speed drops to @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 is a parameter which determines the limit for distinguishing the snr shock from random speeds and is taken to be 2 here . in most cases a snr will merge before it enters the momentum conserving shell stage ( cmb88 ) . in this case the timescale for merger is @xmath44^{10/7}$ ] with @xmath45 .      for the case of a gas consisting of a single species of particle with mass @xmath46 ,",
    "the post - shock temperature is @xmath47 .",
    "the post shock gas is a mixture of electrons and different species of ions .",
    "the shock wave heats the ions to a much higher temperature than the electrons because of the high ratio of ion to electron mass ( @xmath48 for protons , higher for other ions ) .",
    "we follow the discussion of electron heating given in @xcite , which uses the results of @xcite .",
    "the electron - ion temperature equilibration timescale due to coulomb collisions is : @xmath49yr .",
    "the electron - to - ion temperature ratio is given by @xmath50 , with @xmath51 given to a good approximation by @xmath52.\\ ] ] here @xmath53 with the coulomb logarithm given by @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the time a parcel of gas was shocked and the post - shock density is @xmath56 .",
    "we approximate @xmath57 by @xmath58 here because the mean age of the shocked gas is @xmath59 .",
    "observations show that young supernova remnants have a lower limit on @xmath60 of about 0.03 ( see fig . 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "in the formula for @xmath51 above we inserted the factor of 0.97 , to obtain an early time limit of 0.03 .",
    "we apply the temperature ratio @xmath51 to find both electron and ion temperatures from the shock velocity . for a single particle species one has @xmath61 . for a mixture of species , electrons and ions , with mean mass per particle @xmath62 and @xmath11 , respectively , one has @xmath63 this reduces to the correct result in the case of a single species .",
    "it also allows definition of the shock temperature , which is the temperature to which a ( fictitious ) species of mass @xmath64 would be heated , with @xmath65 . with the electron to ion temperature ratio , @xmath51 , and shock velocity @xmath66 , one uses the above formulae to find @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the radiation from the hot shocked plasma in the interior of a snr is dominated by two body processes , so it is proportional to the product of the electron and ion densities .",
    "( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the emission measure , em , is defined by the integral over volume of the product of electron density @xmath5 and proton ( or hydrogen ion ) density @xmath69 : @xmath70 .",
    "em depends on @xmath5 , @xmath69 and their dependence on radius in the interior of the snr , and on the total volume of the interior , which depends on the shock radius , @xmath71 .",
    "em can be determined by analysis of x - ray spectrum observations of a snr , so serves as a critical constraint on the state of the snr .",
    "em is given by the @xmath72 parameter from fitting the x - ray spectrum ( see the xspec manual at heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) : @xmath73 , with @xmath74 , the distance to the snr , and all units are assumed to be cgs .",
    "an estimate of the magnitude of em can be done using a uniform snr interior with typical parameters @xmath75 @xmath76 , @xmath77pc to obtain @xmath78@xmath76 .",
    "thus em is often expressed in units of @xmath79@xmath76 .    to calculate em from a snr model , the interior density profile of the snr is required . during the self - similar phases of evolution of a snr ,",
    "the shape of the profile is constant with only the overall normalization and scaling with radius changing with time .",
    "thus we define the dimensionless em , @xmath80 , by @xmath81 with @xmath82 and @xmath83 the values of @xmath5 and @xmath69 immediately inside the shock front .",
    "@xmath80 is independent of time for the self similar phases of evolution . here",
    "the shock is assumed to be a strong shock with compression ratio of 4 , so that @xmath83=@xmath84 with @xmath69 the ism value .",
    "@xmath82 is determined by @xmath83 and the mean molecular weights of the post - shock gas .",
    "the observed temperature of a snr , derived from the x - ray spectrum , depends on the state of the snr and on the x - ray spectrum model used . for most snrs",
    ", a single electron - temperature non - equilibrium ionization model is used . in this case , the observed temperature measures the emission weighted temperature of the emitting gas .",
    "we define the dimensionless temperature @xmath85 by : @xmath86 i.e. , the emission weighted temperature is @xmath87 . for the self - similar phases of evolution of an snr",
    ", the temperature structure has a constant shape , normalized by the temperature at the shock front , so that @xmath85 is a constant .",
    "the surface brightness of a snr depends on the line - of - sight integral of the emission coefficient , given by : @xmath88 , where the integral is taken along the line of sight through the snr at impact parameter @xmath89 from the snr center .",
    "the volume emission coefficient @xmath90 is given in terms of the emissivity @xmath91 by @xmath92 .",
    "in general @xmath91 depends on the history of the particular parcel of emitting gas , but usually this is simplified . for example @xmath91 can be taken as depending only on current temperature , @xmath93 of the parcel . for simplicity",
    ", we use this approximation here .",
    "a better approximation is that it depends on temperature and on an ionization timescale parameter @xmath94 or , equivalently , on an ionization parameter @xmath95 ( @xcite , @xcite ) . for simplicity , here we calculate the surface brightness profile using thermal bremsstrahlung as the emission mechanism .",
    "this is only a rough approximation of the emission from an ionized plasma ( e.g. see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the bremsstrahlung emission coefficient , in units of erg s@xmath33@xmath76 hz@xmath33sr@xmath33 , is @xmath96 here @xmath97 is radius scaled by the shock radius , @xmath98 is interior temperature scaled by the shock temperature and @xmath99 is the photon energy divided by @xmath100 .",
    "thus the argument of the exponential reduces to @xmath101 .",
    "@xmath102 is the gaunt factor and @xmath103 is the mean value of @xmath104 for the plasma . @xmath105 and @xmath106",
    "are given by the interior density profile of the snr , normalized to 1 at the shock front , times the values at the shock front @xmath82 or @xmath107 .",
    "thus we obtain the surface brightness at a given scaled photon energy @xmath108 : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the scaled radius along the line of sight at a given impact parameter @xmath89 .",
    "the total luminosity of the snr at a given scaled photon energy @xmath108 is given by integrating the surface brightness over the area of the snr , which is equivalent to integrating the emission coefficient over volume of the snr : @xmath111 .",
    "the luminosity in any given energy band @xmath112 to @xmath113 is obtained by integrating @xmath114 over the scaled energy range @xmath115 to @xmath116 .",
    "the ed phase is the time during which the ejected mass dominates over the swept - up mass from the csm on the evolution of the snr .",
    "the st phase is the time after the effects of ejected mass are dominant but prior to onset of radiative losses .",
    "we refer to the so - called standard st solution , which assumes zero ejected mass , as `` pure st '' to differentiate it from the st phases calculated by tm99 , which include the effects of non - zero ejected mass .",
    "the evolution starts with the early ed self - similar phase , previously considered by @xcite for @xmath117 .",
    "the shock evolution during the full ed and st phases can be calculated using the results of tm99 .",
    "they consider the full non - radiative evolution of a snr , which ends with the start of transition to the pds radiative phase at time @xmath118 . during the ed phase ,",
    "the reverse shock propagates inward into the ejecta , eventually reaching the center of the snr . a core - envelope structure for the ejecta",
    "is assumed with constant density core and power - law density envelope , with index n. for @xmath119 , the core can be taken to have zero size .",
    "for @xmath117 the outermost velocity of the envelope @xmath120 does not affect the mass or energy of the envelope so that the parameter @xmath121 can be taken to be zero ( by taking the limit @xmath122 ) . here",
    "we calculate snr forward and reverse shock evolution for uniform csm ( s=0 ) for the following cases of ejecta power law index : n=0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 and 14 . for the csm wind profile case(s=2 ) , we calculate n=0 , 1 , 2 and 7 cases .",
    "first consider the s=0 cases .",
    "for n=0 we use the solutions given in table 5 of tm99 . for this case the reverse shock reaches maximum radius at 1.046@xmath123 .",
    "the early self - similar evolution , with constant ratio of reverse shock radius @xmath124 to forward shock radius @xmath125 , ends much earlier : it is violated at the 5% level by 0.175@xmath123 . for n=2",
    ", we use the solutions of tm99 with parameters given in their table 3 , noting that their table 4 solutions contain some incorrect numbers , inconsistent with table 3 . for @xmath126 ,",
    "the solutions are specified by @xmath127 and @xmath128 , so these are inverted using a root finding algorithm to yield @xmath129 and @xmath130 , hence @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "for n=4 and @xmath126 , we use the tm99 equations ( 47 ) , ( 48 ) and ( 49 ) . for n=4 and @xmath133 , we use the tm99 equations ( 57 ) and ( 58 ) .",
    "however to better match their n=4 numerical solutions for the reverse shock given in their figs . 4 and 5 , we add an acceleration term to @xmath130 for @xmath134 . as for n=2 , for @xmath126 the relations @xmath127 and @xmath128 are inverted to get the solutions . for n=6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 and 14",
    ", we use the @xmath117 solutions of tm99 . for @xmath129 ,",
    "the solution is specified by their equations ( 75 ) and ( 76 ) for @xmath126 and equations ( 57 ) , ( 81 ) and ( 82 ) for @xmath133 .",
    "for @xmath130 , the solution is specified by their equation ( 77 ) and @xmath135 for @xmath136 and equations ( 83 ) and ( 84 ) for @xmath134 until the reverse shock hits the center .",
    "next we discuss the s=2 cases . for n= 0 , 1 and 2 we use the solutions from table 8 of tm99 and invert @xmath127 to get @xmath129 then use @xmath135 . for n=",
    "7 we use the solutions from table 9 of tm99 , which is the same as that from @xcite .",
    "we follow the treatment given in cmb88 for the radiative phases for snr in a uniform csm ( s=0 case ) . the different cases above with different ejecta profiles ( values of n ) have radii different at a given time than the pure sedov - taylor solution ( see results section ) .",
    "thus the matching of radiative phases onto the non - radiative phase has to be done differently than in cmb88 . cmb88",
    "investigated numerical hydrodynamic solutions of snr evolution , then compared those to analytic models for blast wave evolution .",
    "they then fit an offset power - law as a good approximation to the numerical solutions .",
    "however this creates a discontinuity in velocity at @xmath118 where the relation @xmath137 is violated . in order to get a smooth evolution of the blast wave radius and velocity and",
    "also satisfy @xmath137 at all times , we include a smooth transition .",
    "we linearly interpolate the shock velocity from the value at @xmath118 from the previous phase to the value in the pds phase at time 1.1@xmath118",
    ". then we integrate the equation @xmath137 to get @xmath129 at all times for @xmath138 .    to determine when the pds phase ends we calculate the merger time @xmath139 and the onset of the mcs phase @xmath140 , as defined in cmb88 . if @xmath141 then the evolution is terminated . if @xmath142 then @xmath143 for the mcs phase is calculated similarly to that for the beginning of the pds phase , by interpolating between @xmath140 and 1.1@xmath140 and then integrating @xmath137 .",
    "we follow the treatment of wl91 , which presented self - similar models for snr evolution in a cloudy ism .",
    "the self - similar models are similar to the standard self - similar sedov - taylor model for the evolution of the blast wave radius , although the interior structure of the cloudy snr models is drastically different .",
    "the wl models depend on two parameters : a cloud density parameter @xmath144 , with @xmath145 is the ism density if the clouds were uniformly dispersed in the ism ; and an evaporation timescale parameter @xmath146 , with @xmath147 the evaporation timescale and @xmath148 the age of the snr .",
    "the wl models reduce to a one parameter set which depend on @xmath149 , in the limit @xmath150 approaches @xmath151 .",
    "we use these one parameter models , in particular , the three cases @xmath149=1 , 2 and 4 .",
    "the wl91 model is strictly applicable , like the standard sedov - taylor model , for the case of zero ejected mass , and evolution in a cloudy ism from t=0 .",
    "we join the cloudy snr models onto the earlier phases with finite ejected mass at time @xmath152 .",
    "earlier than @xmath152 , the snr blast wave evolution is dominated by the interaction of the ejecta , so the effects of a cloudy ism are hard to determine and have not yet been investigated in enough detail .",
    "the transition to cloudy snr evolution is calculated by interpolating the forward shock velocity @xmath143 at @xmath152 , to the velocity given by the wl91 model at 1.1@xmath152 . then @xmath125 is found by integrating @xmath137 for @xmath133 .",
    "the cloudy snr phase ends when radiative cooling becomes important .",
    "however it ends very differently than for the st phases described above . rather than entering a pds phase , the snr enters directly into the mcs phase .",
    "this happens because of the interior structure for the wl91 models ( see fig.2 of wl91 ) .",
    "because the temperature and density are much more uniform than for the st models ( pure st model and st models of tm99 ) , the whole interior of the cloudy snr cools at nearly the same time , which results in the loss of interior pressure at nearly the same time that the forward shock evolution is affected by loss of pressure .",
    "lk2000 introduced an analytic model for radiative blast wave evolution , based on the thin shell approximation .",
    "they introduced a parameter @xmath153 which determines the fractional energy loss rate at the shock front , @xmath154 by the relation : @xmath155 . here",
    "@xmath38 is the adiabatic index of the gas ( both upstream and downstream ) and @xmath153 is constrained by @xmath156 .",
    "the post - shock expressions for pressure , velocity and density are the conventional expressions but with @xmath38 replaced by @xmath153 ( see lk2000 ) .",
    "the total energy content of the blast wave decreases with time as a result of the energy loss : @xmath157 .",
    "the momentum conservation equation , with internal driving pressure , determines the motion of the blast wave : @xmath158 , with the ratio of interior pressure @xmath159 to post - shock pressure @xmath160 given by @xmath161 .",
    "the total energy of the snr is given by the kinetic energy of the shell plus the internal energy of the hot interior ( equation 6 of lk2000 ) .",
    "then @xmath162 is given by @xmath163^{1/2})/4 $ ] .",
    "as in lk2000 we define @xmath164 , then integrate the equation of motion for @xmath143 .",
    "however we use different boundary conditions than lk2000 so obtain different solutions for @xmath129 and @xmath131 .",
    "i.e. we join the constant energy loss solution onto an earlier phase of snr evolution at time @xmath55 , with radius @xmath165 and velocity @xmath166 .",
    "the resulting solution is : @xmath167^{n_{\\alpha}}\\ ] ] and @xmath168^{3\\alpha-3}.\\ ] ]    the above solution was derived using the momentum equation for a thin shell .",
    "however , when one sets @xmath169 and uses initial @xmath55 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 from the pure st stage , one recovers the pure st evolution for @xmath129 and @xmath131 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath129 and @xmath131 for the constant energy loss model with @xmath169 also reduces to the tm99 evolution for the various n values in the st phase.when choosing a non - zero fractional energy loss @xmath170 , the shock front decelerates more rapidly than for the respective adiabatic phases ( pure st phase or tm99 st phases ) .",
    "this is expected because of the reduced post - shock pressure resulting from the energy loss . in our snr modelling software",
    ", we allow the user to have fractional energy loss phase start at any time in the st or pds phases . prior to @xmath152",
    ", the fractional energy loss model does not properly represent the snr evolution .",
    "the evolution of a snr in a hot low - density medium deviates significantly from the st evolution because of the effects of swept - up energy from the ism and of the high sound speed @xcite(hereafter tw2005 ) .",
    "they verified their analytic approximations with hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "the effects of a hot ism are large for the evolution if the critical time @xmath171 is less than the shell formation timescale for the snr , @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath171 is defined by @xmath172^{1/3}$ ] with @xmath173 ( see tw2005 ) .",
    "if @xmath174 , then the snr never enters the radiative phase but instead has an outer velocity which asymptotically approaches the sound speed in the hot ism .    instead of matching the hot - ism snr solution onto a pure st model ( as done in tw2005 ) , we match to any of the tm99 st phases at time @xmath175 , which has a default value of @xmath176 . at earlier times than @xmath177 ,",
