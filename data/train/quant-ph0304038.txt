    "the recent experimental progress in manipulating and controlling trapped neutral atoms in optical lattices by quantum optical means @xcite allows for a number of novel applications in a variety of different fields like quantum information processing @xcite , atom interferometry @xcite , and atomic and molecular physics @xcite .",
    "one of the most important features in all of these applications is the large degree of control by quantum optical techniques over the structure and the parameters of the hamiltonian describing the atomic system .",
    "this control allows to realize and deploy a number of lattice hamiltonians @xcite which are frequently used as toy models for strongly correlated condensed matter systems and therefore theoretically very well studied . however , many of the most interesting effects in strongly correlated 2d systems appear if an external magnetic field is applied @xcite . apart from rotating an atomic cloud @xcite , as assumed for example in the study of laughlin states with bosonic atoms in ref .",
    "@xcite , there seems to be at present no obvious way of implementing lattice hamiltonians resembling the effects of magnetic fields with neutral atoms .    in this paper",
    "we propose a 2d setup for neutral atoms which allows to engineer terms in single - band hubbard hamiltonians corresponding to an external magnetic field .",
    "an optical lattice provides the discrete periodic spatial structure and we will use lasers instead of a magnetic field to induce a phase for particles hopping around a closed path in the lattice resembling an effective magnetic field .",
    "we will show that the strength of this effective magnetic field can be varied by laser parameters and be made arbitrarily large , a situation first theoretically investigated by hofstadter @xcite for electrons .",
    "the studies by hofstadter predicted the emergence of fractal energy bands @xmath0 that resemble the shape of a butterfly when plotted against the parameter @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the area of one of the elementary cells of the lattice , @xmath3 is the strength of the magnetic field , and @xmath4 is the charge of the particles ( cf .",
    "fig  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the phase @xmath5 is gained by the wave function of a particle due to the magnetic field when it hops around a plaquette of the lattice . as shown by hofstadter",
    "the nature of the energy bands depends crucially on the parameter @xmath6 . if @xmath7 with @xmath8 integers , i.e.  @xmath6 is a rational number , the energy spectrum splits into a finite number of exactly @xmath9 bands whereas if @xmath6 is irrational the energy spectrum breaks up in infinitely many bands and thus the fractal structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] emerges ( for a detailed discussion on the properties of the hofstadter butterfly see @xcite ) .",
    "are shown as black dots for different @xmath6 , and @xmath10 is the hopping energy as defined in the text .",
    "the most dominant feature is the splitting of the energy band into @xmath9 subbands for @xmath11 . for further details of this plot see @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    fractal energy band structures are believed to play an important role for a number of effects like the quantum hall effect induced by magnetic fields in strongly correlated electron systems @xcite .",
    "therefore it is desirable to study the hofstadter butterfly experimentally under well defined conditions .",
    "however , it turns out that the area of the elementary cells in metals where fractal energy bands could possibly be seen is so small that huge magnetic fields would be required to obtain values of @xmath6 which are on the order of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "also in more sophisticated superlattice setups with larger area @xmath2 it is experimentally very difficult to obtain direct clear experimental evidence of the hofstadter butterfly @xcite .",
    "we will consider a 2d system of ultracold atoms trapped in one layer in the @xmath13 plane of a three dimensional optical lattice .",
    "the atoms are in the lowest motional band which can be achieved e.g.  by loading the optical lattice from a bose - einstein condensate @xcite . hopping along the @xmath14 direction is turned off completely by the lattice potential .",
    "different columns of the lattice trap atoms in internal states @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) ( denoted in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a by open ( closed ) circles ) @xcite .",
    "in addition the optical lattice is either accelerated along the @xmath17-axis or an inhomogeneous static electric field is applied and two raman lasers driving transitions between the states @xmath15 and @xmath16 induce hopping along the @xmath17-axis while hopping along the @xmath18-axis is controlled by the depth of the optical lattice along this direction .",
    "this setup corresponds to applying a magnetic field with a parameter @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the wave number of the raman lasers along the @xmath18 direction and @xmath21 the wave length of the lasers creating the optical lattice .",
    "we also note that the atomic setup we are going to describe here can be used for a large number of other purposes .",
    "it is straightforward to add terms to the system that correspond to an external electric field .",
    "also the atoms will interact with each other via collisional contact interactions @xcite and off site interactions can be engineered by dipolar rydberg interactions @xcite . therefore the setup presented here can be used for a number of studies related to the behavior of charged particles in a 2d configuration subject to magnetic and electric fields and also to study strongly interacting and thus strongly correlated systems .",
    "furthermore it might be possible to extend this model to different geometries of optical lattices .    in this work",
    "we will concentrate on a possible setup required to implement the effective magnetic field in an optical lattice .",
    "we will discuss in detail the laser setup which leads to an effective magnetic flux through the optical lattice , and calculate the corresponding matrix elements in sec .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "we also show that it is possible to reach each point within the hofstadter butterfly apart from a negligibly small region around @xmath22 with the proposed setup . in sec .",
    "[ meas ] we suggest one possibility of measuring some of the basic properties of the hofstadter butterfly and discuss the limitations on the resolution for measuring the energy bands .",
    "we also give a brief account of the interaction effects .",
    "finally we conclude with a short outlook on how the present setup could be extended in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "while the focus of the present work is the derivation of the single - particle terms in the hubbard hamiltonian mimicking a strong magnetic field , we see as one of the main motivations the extension of strongly correlated many - atom systems in strong ( effective ) magnetic fields .",
    "in this section we discuss the experimental setup required to produce a hofstadter butterfly for neutral atoms .",
    "we first present the optical lattice setup , then introduce an additional acceleration or static electric field and finally describe in detail the additional lasers required for our purpose .",
    "we consider a three dimensional optical lattice created by standing wave laser fields which generate a potential for the atomic motion of the form ( we use @xmath23 throughout the paper ) @xmath24 with @xmath25 the wave - vector of the light and spatial coordinate @xmath26 .",
    "the recoil energy is given by @xmath27 with @xmath28 the mass of the atoms .",
    "we assume the lattice to trap atoms in two different internal hyperfine states @xmath16 and @xmath15 and the depth of the lattice in @xmath17- and @xmath14-direction to be so large that hopping in these directions due to kinetic energy is prohibited @xcite .",
    "furthermore we assume that adjusting the polarization of the lasers which confine the particles in the @xmath17-direction allows to place the potential wells trapping atoms in the different internal states at distances @xmath29 with respect to each other @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "therefore the resulting 2d lattice has a lattice constant ( disregarding the internal state ) in @xmath17-direction of @xmath30 and in @xmath18-direction of @xmath31 .",
    "we restrict our analysis to one layer of the optical lattice in the @xmath13 plane since in the following there will neither be hopping nor interactions between different layers .",
    "the dynamics of bosonic atoms occupying the lowest bloch band of this optical lattice is well described by the bose - hubbard model ( bhm ) @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the hopping matrix element for particles to tunnel between adjacent sites along the @xmath18-direction .",
    "the energy difference between the two hyperfine states is @xmath34 and the operators @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) are bosonic destruction ( creation ) operators for atoms in the lowest motional band located at the site which is centered at @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the corresponding mode functions are the localized wannier functions @xmath40 @xcite found by suitable superpositions of the bloch functions for the lowest bloch band of the lattice .",
    "since in @xmath17-direction the separation between two neighboring atoms is half the original lattice constant @xmath41 the overlap of the mode functions of particles in adjacent lattice sites might lead to significant nearest neighbor interactions described by @xmath42 whereas we neglect any other offsite interactions @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 describes the onsite interaction between two particles occupying the same site .",
    "this onsite interaction may depend on the column index @xmath44 because of different internal states with different scattering lengths occupying different columns .",
    "since for even [ odd ] @xmath44 the operator @xmath35 describes atoms in internal states @xmath16 , [ @xmath15 ] and the wannier functions for sites which are separated by multiples of the original lattice constant @xmath41 are orthogonal to each other we find the commutation relations @xmath46",

    "the details of the derivation of the above hamiltonian can be found in @xcite where also the definitions for the parameters @xmath48 , @xmath42 , and @xmath33 are given .",
    "( @xmath16 ) .",
    "a ) hopping in the @xmath18-direction is due to kinetic energy and described by the hopping matrix element @xmath33 being the same for particles in states @xmath16 and @xmath15 . along the @xmath17-direction",
    "hopping amplitudes are due to the additional lasers .",
    "b ) trapping potential in @xmath17-direction .",
    "adjacent sites are set off by an energy @xmath49 because of the acceleration or a static inhomogeneous electric field .",
    "the laser @xmath50 is resonant for transitions @xmath51 due to the offset of the lattice sites . because of the spatial dependence of @xmath52 atoms hopping around one plaquette get phase shifts of @xmath53 where @xmath54 as indicated in a).[fig2 ] ]      in addition to the above setup we assume an energy offset of @xmath49 between two adjacent sites in @xmath17-direction as shown in fig .",
    "this can be done by accelerating the optical lattice along the @xmath17-axis with a constant acceleration @xmath55 leading to an additional potential energy term for one atom of @xmath56 .",
    "alternatively , if both of the internal atomic states @xmath16 and @xmath15 have the same static polarizability @xmath57 an inhomogeneous static electric field of the form @xmath58 can be applied to the optical lattice yielding a potential energy term @xmath59 .",
    "we keep this additional potential energy small compared to the optical lattice potential and treat @xmath60 as a perturbation . in second quantization this yields @xmath61 where @xmath62 in the case of an inhomogeneous electric field and @xmath63 if the lattice is accelerated . the condition for this perturbative treatment to be valid is @xmath64 with @xmath65 the trapping frequency of the optical lattice in the @xmath17-direction .",
    "finally , we want to induce hopping along the @xmath17-direction by two additional lasers driving raman transitions between the states @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "each of them consists of two running plane waves chosen to give space dependent rabi frequencies of the form @xmath66 with @xmath67 the magnitude of the rabi frequencies , and detunings @xmath68 .",
    "we choose the parameters @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "as discussed in detail in appendix [ app1 ] this can always be achieved by superimposing two running wave laser beams incident in the @xmath13-plane for @xmath72 with @xmath73 the speed of light .",
    "we assume the lasers not to excite any higher lying motional bloch bands and also no transitions with detunings of the order of @xmath49 , i.e. , @xmath74 . then the lasers @xmath75 will only drive transitions @xmath76 if @xmath44 is even ( odd ) and we can neglect any influence of the nonresonant transitions . we find the following hamiltonian describing the effect of the additional lasers @xmath77 where we have neglected all other terms due to being nonresonant and defined matrix elements @xmath78 for even @xmath44 @xmath79 and for odd @xmath44 @xmath80 for an optical lattice potential of the form eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) the wannier functions can be written as a product of three normalized wannier functions , i.e. @xmath81 @xcite , and we can write @xmath82 where we have defined the matrix elements @xmath83 and @xmath84 . the values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 as a function of the depth of the optical lattice @xmath87 are shown in fig .",
    "both matrix elements are sufficiently large so that the above inequality @xmath88 can be fulfilled if we want to achieve hopping amplitudes @xmath89 of the order of khz .",
    "we simplify @xmath90 to find @xmath91     as a function of the depth of the optical lattice @xmath92 .",
    "b ) matrix element @xmath86 as a function of the depth of the optical lattice @xmath92 for different values of @xmath93 decreasing with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "the inset shows @xmath86 against @xmath6 at @xmath94.[fig3 ] ]      the total hamiltonian describing the configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is given by @xmath95 and we will for simplicity assume @xmath96 . in this work",
    "we will mainly consider small filling factors of the optical lattice @xmath97 with @xmath98 the average number of particles per lattice site and thus only look at one particle effects neglecting the interaction terms @xmath99 and @xmath42 .",
    "then the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath100 this hamiltonian @xmath101 is equivalent to the hamiltonian for electrons with charge @xmath4 moving on a lattice in an external magnetic field @xmath102 @xcite , where @xmath103 is the area of one elementary cell . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we will study the properties of @xmath104 for neutral atoms in optical lattices and in particular show that it can be used to study the whole of the hofstadter butterfly shown in fig .",
    "we note that we have chosen the detunings of the additional lasers @xmath52 to exactly cancel the term @xmath60 arising from the acceleration or electric field .",
    "if these two terms did not cancel the remaining terms resemble a homogeneous electric field .",
    "in this section we show how to detect basic properties of the fractal energy spectrum in an experiment .",
    "we also briefly discuss the effects of fluctuations in the laser parameters , of finite system sizes , and interactions between the atoms .",
    "one way of experimentally identifying the number of energy bands in the case of rational @xmath6 is to measure the time evolution of the particle density @xmath105 in the lattice .",
    "we assume the lattice to be loaded from a bose - einstein condensate @xcite neglect any interaction between the atoms and consider only a single atom .",
    "the initial wave function of the system is assumed to be @xmath106 a normalization constant .",
    "we then turn on the additional lasers to simulate a magnetic field and find the density of particles given by @xmath107 to be independent of @xmath17 .",
    "if we choose @xmath108 a periodic interference pattern emerges in the time evolution of @xmath109 .",
    "different paths for hopping around in the lattice interfere with periodic phase relations ( cf .  fig .  [ fig4]a ) .",
    "the periodicity of interference pattern is determined by @xmath9 and repeats itself after exactly @xmath9 lattice sites as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a for @xmath110 .",
    "the periodicity is destroyed for values of @xmath6 which are irrational .",
    "an example can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4]b where a value of @xmath111 is chosen which differs by about @xmath112 from @xmath110 .",
    "this little change in @xmath6 is sufficient to considerably alter the density of particles in the lattice and to destroy any periodicity .",

    "b ) for a value of @xmath111 the periodicity in the particle density disappears and the visibility of the interference fringes decreases .",
    "[ fig4 ] ]      as discussed by hofstadter @xcite the maximum number of energy bands shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which can in principle be distinguished in an experiment , depends on the fluctuations in the parameter @xmath6 . in our case",
    "these fluctuations are determined by the frequency stability of the lasers and will thus not be significant . in an experiment with neutral atoms the resolution of the energy bands",
    "will rather be determined by the size of the whole sample , i.e. by the number @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the size of the whole sample , and by the spatial resolution in measuring interference patterns as described in sec .",

    "we postpone a detailed study of these effects to a further publication and only include a graph of how the ground state in an optical lattice with a superimposed 2d harmonic trap of trapping frequency @xmath118 @xmath119 looks like in the presence of the effective magnetic field .",
    "we use mean field theory in the form of the gutzwiller ansatz ( as described in @xcite ) , and numerically solve for the ground state of the system for finite @xmath120 . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we plot the particle number fluctuations @xmath121 with @xmath122 and the modulus of the superfluid parameter @xmath123 .",
    "the effective magnetic field alters these properties of the ground state significantly in comparison to the case of @xmath22 .",
    "the effective magnetic field leads to a decrease of the particle number fluctuations and the superfluid density in the center of the trap which is typical for the onset of a mott - insulating phase even for @xmath124 with @xmath125 the critical interaction strength for the transition to the mott insulator .",
    "a similar behavior has already been found in @xcite .",

    "in conclusion we have shown that quantum optical techniques allow to implement hamiltonians often used to model charged particles subject to an external magnetic field in a lattice .",
    "we have shown that all of the physically interesting parameter regime can be explored by this setup and proposed one method to measure some of the most striking features of the fractal energy bands of the hofstadter butterfly .",
    "the setup we have investigated possesses a lot of possibilities for further extensions towards quantum simulations of strongly correlated systems of charged particles like interacting electrons moving on a lattice subject to electric and magnetic fields . the major difference and at the same time one of the most attractive features of the atomic system is a large degree of control that can be exerted by quantum optical means . in comparison to condensed matter systems",
    "the hamiltonian describing the system is very well known and the parameters appearing can be controlled and varied over a much wider range than is usually the case for strongly correlated systems .",
    "also , the time scale over which these parameters can be changed is short in comparison to decoherence time scales in the system .",
    "this allows to study coherent dynamical effects that are not easily accessible in most condensed matter systems .",
