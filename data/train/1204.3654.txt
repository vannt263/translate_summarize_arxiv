    "it was recently shown that relativistic stars may become unstable due to quantum - field effects  @xcite . the so - called _ vacuum awakening effect",

    "this is caused by a tachyonic - like instability , which induces an exponential growth of @xmath2 .",
    "once the effect is triggered and the scalar field exits its initial quiescent regime , few milliseconds would be enough for the vacuum to overwhelm the energy density of the compact object .",

    "this would typically change the star gravitational mass by a few percent .",

    "whatever turns out to be the final configuration , being the star somehow rebalanced or destroyed , the unstable phase must be detained and the vacuum must evolve to some new stationary regime .",

    "[ detectors ] , we probe the unstable phase using unruh - dewitt detectors . in this period , no natural particle content can be ascribed to the scalar field and the use of detectors is particularly useful to investigate the behavior of the vacuum fluctuation .",
    "we show in this section that even assuming a static spacetime in the unstable phase when the vacuum is  awake \" , particle detectors following orbits of the timelike isometry will copiously excite .",
    "this is possible according to co - static observers because each detector excitation is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the energy stored in the field due to the excitation of a nonstationary ( tachyonic ) mode which contributes with negative energy .",
