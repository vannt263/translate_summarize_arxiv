    "in this paper , we have presented a new set of ssp models that include the contributions of blue straggler stars , i.e. , ` bs - corrected ' ssp ( bs - ssp ) models .",
    "the new models are developed to improve the standard ssp models by taking into account the effects of stellar interactions through empirical inclusion of the bs contribution in each ssp .",
    "the empirical properties of the bs populations are obtained based on photometric data of bss in 100 galactic ocs .",
    "we have tested that ( i ) the broad - band colours in our models are highly consistent with the colours of 100 galactic ocs if bss are properly accounted for and ( ii ) age predictions based on spectral fits to our models yield ages that are closer to the cmd ages compared to the ages derived based on the bc03 models .",
    "the test results prove the reliability of our models and indicate that our models offer important improvements for studies of stellar populations .",
    "the basic description of our bs - ssp models includes :    1 .",
    "the models cover the wavelength range from 91 to 160 @xmath0 m , ages from 0.1 to 20 gyr and metallicities @xmath5 ( solar metallicity ) and 0.05 .",
    "the metallicity @xmath6 is not included , because extended hb stars , instead of bss , dominate the energies in the uv and blue bands in such extremely metal - poor ssps .",
    "the models are constructed as increments to the bc03 standard ssp models using the padova1994 isochrones and the lejeune et al .",
    "( 1997 ) stellar spectra , . they can thus be used directly in eps studies as replacement of bc03 for the same parameter coverage .",
    "application of the models should be limited to the ` low - resolution ' regime . as each bs spectrum",
    "is approximated by the theoretical spectrum of a single ms star , the models can not fully account for changes in the spectral lines that are related to the formation scenarios of bss .",
    "the essential effect of bss is to make an ssp s ised hotter in the uv , blue and optical bands , and consequently turn the broad - band colours much bluer .",
    "taking the ssp models with @xmath7 as an example , the differences in the broad - band colours between bc03 and our models are 0.10@xmath80.05  mag in @xmath9 , 0.08@xmath80.02  mag in @xmath10 , 0.05@xmath80.01  mag in @xmath11 , 0.12@xmath80.05  mag in @xmath12 , 0.09@xmath80.02  mag in @xmath13 and 0.17@xmath80.03  mag in @xmath14 .    given the common presence of bss in various stellar systems , we believe that the bs - ssp models will enable the community to uncover interesting results in studies of stellar populations . in general , our models allow old ssps to have higher energies ( intensities ) in uv and blue bands , which implies that the prediction from our models will be in the direction of older age and/or higher metallicity for a given population compared to the standard ssp models .",
    "for instance , ( i ) the shift of @xmath15 mag towards the blue for the broad - band colours may influence our understanding of the age of the oldest stellar population in a galaxy based on the observed colour distribution of gcs ( e.g. , yoon et al .",
    "2006 , who quote a typical observational error of @xmath15 mag in @xmath14 ) ; and ( ii ) the dramatic enhancement in the iseds caused by bss may lead to a new understanding of the uv upturn in elliptical galaxies .",
    "han et al .",
    "( 2007 ) successfully approached the problem with their newly developed eps models that now also include binary evolution . since",
    "binary interaction is also one of the major formation mechanisms of bss , it is possible that bss can ( at least partially ) contribute to this uv excess .",
    "the current version of the bs - ssp models is available from http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/~webaiub/english/downloads.php and http://sss.bao.ac.cn/bss .",
    "we will update the models when any significant and systematic improvements based on either observational or theoretical studies regarding bs formation in star clusters become available .",
    "updated versions of the models will be provided at http://sss.bao.ac.cn/bss .",

    "<S> observations show that nearly all star clusters and stellar populations contain blue straggler stars ( bss ) . </S>",

    "<S> contrary to our uv spectra test discussed in previous subsection , we leave the cluster age as a free parameter in this test . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the observed spectra with the model spectra for different ages and calculate the standard deviation for selected points of the continuum between the observed and model spectra to identify the best fit . the best fit yields a predicted age for the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we subsequently compare the age values from bc03 and from our models to see if our models can derive more accurate ages for our sample clusters , i.e. , ages that are closer to the age based on cmd isochrone fitting .    as a result , </S>",

    "<S> kron  3 , 6 , 7 and 28 are characterised by very high intensities at the red ends of their spectra , which can only be traced by our models if we adopt ages that are much older ( @xmath2 gyr ) than the clusters real ages ( from cmd analysis ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bc03 models can not fit their spectra in the blue and red bands simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> explanations such as the absence of agb stars from both models , the presence of carbon stars ( feast & lloyd  evans 1973 ; mould et al . 1992 ) , and contamination by field stars ( piatti et al . 2001 ) may be responsible for the poor understanding of the observed spectra of these five clusters . since this is beyond the scope of this paper , we focus instead on the four clusters which can be readily understood on the basis of ssp model analysis .    </S>",

    "<S> the fit residuals are presented as the solid lines in the bottom part of each panel . </S>",
    "<S> they have been calculated as @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> both the bc03 models and our models with different imfs can perfectly fit the continuum of the four smc star clusters over almost the entire wavelength range . </S>",
    "<S> the model spectra can also roughly match the features of the balmer lines of the observed spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit for different models refers to different age determinations for the same star cluster . </S>",
    "<S> bc03 always returns a younger age for a given cluster compared to the age from our models ( see table  [ table4 ] ) , since bss turn the ssps hotter . </S>",
    "<S> considerable uncertainties only appear for @xmath4 , where flux fluctuations become larger because the number of photons dramatically drops and the ccds used for such observations usually have low quantum efficiency at uv wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , ssp models also have problems in correctly presenting iseds in the uv because of limitations such as those associated with the adopted stellar - atmosphere models , which may also be responsible for the poor fit at uv wavelengths .    using the technique of isochrone </S>",
    "<S> fitting is comparably easier to identify the dominant population of a star cluster and remove contamination by field stars , and thus to obtain a better estimate of the age and/or metallicity of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> if the parameters are predicted by comparing the observed spectra with model spectra , the results will always suffer from field contamination , and possibly from the presence of multiple populations in the cluster , as well as from limitations inherent to the model coverage . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our conclusion from the model test is that the bs - ssp models can yield more accurate age values for stellar population studies in _ unresolved conditions _ , compared to the ages derived from conventional ssp models .    we did not attempt a metallicity derivation in our model test , mainly because metallicity information is more commonly derived from the properties of a range of characteristic spectral lines , and the current bs - ssp models are not suitable for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> however , if one wants to estimate the metallicity to first order by fitting the continuum of the observed spectrum with model spectra of different metallicities ( more metal - poor ssps have stronger , higher - intensity iseds ; see the bottom right - hand panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig9 ] ) , bss would exhibit the same effect as seen for the age determination , i.e. , bss make the ised hotter compared to iseds from conventional ssps models for a given metallicity , which means that the apparent metal - poor spectrum of a star cluster could actually be more metal - rich . </S>"
