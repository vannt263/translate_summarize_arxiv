    "in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ( ssm ) , the mixed mass  term of the up and down higgs doublets , @xmath2 , must be nonvanishing in order to avoid an undesirable massless axion  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , standard model ( sm ) phenomenology constrains @xmath0 to be of the order of the soft masses . on the other hand ,",
    "the most appealing feature of all ssms is that they provide a valid description up to a scale as large as @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "this triggers a naturalness issue traditionally called the @xmath0problem : why does the supersymmetric mass scale @xmath0 know about the scale of supersymmetry ( susy ) breakdown ? stated differently : where does the hierarchy @xmath5 come from ?",
    "although in the minimal ssm ( the mssm ) the @xmath0term was originally put by hand , it has been shown that breaking supergravity ( sugra ) can induce a @xmath0term of the correct order if one includes radiative corrections  @xcite or if one assumes a special higgs ",
    "dependent structure of the khler potential  @xcite . explaining why @xmath0 vanishes before sugra breakdown might require additional symmetries in the theory , such as peccei ",
    "quinn ( pq ) or @xmath1 symmetries , which would eventually also fix the so - called strong cp problem .",
    "a perhaps more elegant solution to the @xmath0problem is provided by the next - to - minimal ssm ( the nmssm ) @xcite ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) . in the nmssm , the @xmath0term",
    "is generated via the introduction of a singlet superfield @xmath6 with the coupling @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "provided that @xmath6 remains massless in the supersymmetric theory , @xmath6 naturally acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the order of the susy breaking scale , thereby giving rise to an effective @xmath0term of the correct size .",
    "a related matter is the question of how much fine - tuning is required in order for a ssm to accommodate the lep higgs bound . in the mssm , satisfying this bound necessitates large radiative corrections to the tree  level prediction for the sm  like higgs boson @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this can be achieved only if the superpartner masses are very large ( about 1.3 tev ) which would imply considerable fine - tuning of the mssm soft terms . in the nmssm",
    "the situation is better due to the existence of a light pseudoscalar @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath9 decays predominantly into pairs of @xmath11 s and these subsequently decay into taus or light quarks  @xcite . for such final states ,",
    "the lower lep bound on the higgs mass relaxes and can in some cases be as low as 90 gev .",
    "consequently , the superpartners are not required to be very heavy for the higgs mass to comply with this bound , and the fine - tuning problem of the mssm can be avoided .    to single out one solution to these riddles , a top ",
    "down approach might be of great help .",
    "string theory is perhaps the best known candidate to provide some clues about physics from very large energies down to the electroweak scale .",
    "therefore , promising stringy constructions can reveal the correct solution or provide new suitable tools for the resolution of e.g. the problems described before .",
    "this approach has the advantage that , unlike the field - theoretic solutions just described , string - derived models are believed to be ultraviolet complete and all their admissible interactions and matter content are fixed by the theory itself .",
    "this implies that any new feature of phenomenologically acceptable string - derived models can be considered a prediction .",
    "the challenge is then to build such acceptable models .",
    "the main hurdle to addressing low energy physics from string theory is that it predicts the existence of six additional spatial dimensions on top of the four  dimensional space ",
    "time of our everyday life experience . to explain this discrepancy",
    ", it is typically argued that the extra coordinates are compact and too small to be detected at currently achievable energies , or that they are `` invisible '' to us because our experiences are limited to a four  dimensional subspace or brane in which we happen to live .",
    "both interpretations have been explored and led to semi  realistic models  @xcite . among them ,",
    "there is a relatively small number of constructions with the exact mssm spectrum @xcite .    since the first studies , orbifold compactifications of the heterotic string have demonstrated to be optimal candidates to accommodate the properties of our universe .",
    "they are four - dimensional compact spaces divided by a discrete symmetry , what gives rise to a finite number of curvature singularities to which the matter states are attached .",
    "particularly interesting are the orbifold models of the 6ii heterotic mini - landscape  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it has been found that @xmath12 models in this scenario comply with the requirements of displaying the matter spectrum of the mssm and gauge unification . what is more surprising is that models satisfying these requirements are automatically endowed with further appealing features , such as matter parity , low - scale susy breakdown , gauge - top unification , seesaw neutrino masses , flavor symmetries and potentially realistic fermion masses ( see e.g.  @xcite for a review ) . in this paper",
    "we show how also the @xmath0problem is naturally solved in these constructions .",
    "there are several approaches to address the @xmath0problem in string constructions .",
    "for instance , admissible effective @xmath0terms can be generated by ( i ) stringy instantons  @xcite , ( ii ) string threshold corrections , ( iii ) particular structures of the khler potential , ( iv ) nonstandard supergravity interactions  @xcite , and ( v ) explicit superpotential masses  @xcite . in the remainder of this paper , we concentrate on the latter approach and address the origin of an admissible @xmath0term in orbifold ( n)mssms .",
    "our discussion is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : muinmssm ] , we study how a suppressed @xmath0term appears in minkowski vacua as a consequence of an approximate @xmath13 symmetry . in sec .  [ sec : nmssm ] , we briefly address the main properties of the nmssm candidates arising from heterotic orbifolds and discuss the features of an orbifold example . finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to some final remarks .",
    "@xcite , it is argued that an elegant solution to the @xmath0problem can be achieved under the assumption that the operator @xmath14 is vectorlike w.r.t .",
    "all gauge and string symmetries .",
    "in fact , in many of the mini - landscape models and , in particular in the benchmark model 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , this is true . as a consequence ,",
    "any superpotential term @xmath15 allowed by string selection rules will also couple to @xmath14 .",
    "the superpotential can then be written as @xmath16 , with @xmath17 being a polynomial on the singlet fields @xmath18 .",
    "an effective @xmath19 appears once the @xmath18 s develop vevs .",
    "however , from a top - down perspective , @xmath20 seems rather ad hoc . in the following ,",
    "we discuss a natural explanation of this hierarchy .",
    "clearly , @xmath21 depends on the vevs of the singlets , which are subject to the susy constraints @xmath22 .",
    "the requirement to cancel the fayet - iliopoulos d ",
    "term , commonly present in heterotic orbifolds  @xcite , does not fix the size of the vevs @xmath23 , but it introduces in the problem a new scale @xmath24 in planck units .",
    "this results on singlet vevs of the same order , vevs are also possible . ] which are in general fixed by @xmath25 .",
    "remarkably , apart from the features discussed above , it was noted that vanishing f  terms imply that @xmath26 ( truncated at order @xmath27 ) cancels term by term .",
    "the reason was found to be that , when this happens , @xmath26 is endowed with an approximate global @xmath13 symmetry .",
    "this can be seen as follows . under the @xmath1 symmetry , @xmath26 and @xmath18",
    "transform respectively as @xmath28 on the other hand , an infinitesimal @xmath13 transformation of @xmath26 yields @xmath29 which reduces to @xmath30 in a susy - preserving vacua ( i.e. @xmath31 ) .",
    "this is consistent only if @xmath32 vanishes . as a conclusion",
    ", we find that a supersymmetric theory with a @xmath13 symmetry yields naturally minkowski vacua .. ]    the @xmath13 we observe in our models is a low  energy realization of exact discrete symmetries of stringy origin .",
    "then @xmath13 has to be broken explicitly by terms of higher order @xmath33.this has two advantages .",
    "first , if the @xmath1 symmetry is broken at order @xmath34 , @xmath35 is no longer protected and its nonvanishing value is proportional to @xmath36 . in supergravity theories , it follows then that the gravitino mass is @xmath37 .",
    "second , the pseudo - goldstone boson generated by the breaking of the @xmath1 symmetry acquires a mass of order @xmath38 , i.e. enhanced w.r.t . the gravitino mass and thus consistent with current bounds .",
    "as an example , let us consider the benchmark model 1 of ref .",
    "it turns out that this model is furnished with an approximate @xmath13 symmetry which is preserved up to order 10 .",
    "( however , in other models similar symmetries are unbroken up to orders as high as 26 . ) since @xmath39 then minkowski vacua with @xmath40 or smaller emerge naturally from promising heterotic orbifolds .",
    "notice that this solution to the @xmath0problem is only an application of a more interesting finding : the scheme described above can explain the origin of large hierarchies in a natural way .",
    "this is a major achievement considering that precisely this question is one of most intriguing puzzles of contemporary physics .",
    "the hierarchies generated in this way are important to solve many phenomenological issues , such as moduli stabilization  @xcite and the strong cp problem  @xcite . for a detailed discussion ,",
    "see ref .",
    "it is known that in heterotic orbifolds , the @xmath0term does not arise at trilinear level  @xcite . however , it can appear effectively from couplings of the higgs pair to some sm singlets , which are quite abundant in the mini - landscape models .",
    "this motivates the study of the nmssm in string models .",
    "apart from the standard couplings and matter content of the mssm , the ( 3-invariant ) nmssm includes a massless ( at the string level ) singlet @xmath6 with the following superpotential contributions @xmath41 we are assuming that susy is not broken by the f  term of @xmath6 ( in the limit @xmath42 ) and thus the `` tadpole '' term linear in @xmath6 is also negligible . in what follows",
    ", we will assume that all relevant soft parameters , @xmath43 , are of the electroweak ( ew ) size whereas @xmath8 and @xmath44 can take arbitrary values .",
    "after susy breaking , including soft terms , the potential for ( the real part of ) the scalar component of @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath45 , is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "in heterotic orbifolds , @xmath48 and @xmath44 are effective couplings of the form @xmath49 where , as in sec .",
    "[ sec : muinmssm ] , @xmath18 are sm singlets attaining @xmath50 vevs in planck units .",
    "the sm singlet @xmath6 typically comes from the gauge sector and thus carries charges under e.g. some additional unbroken gauge 1s .",
    "these symmetries are violated by @xmath51 and only after they get broken spontaneously , is this effective interaction allowed . as a result , @xmath44 is suppressed by the sm singlet vevs @xmath52 .",
    "note that if @xmath6 is a modulus , it is neutral under gauge symmetries but its interactions are planck suppressed and we arrive to the same conclusion . in contrast , a coupling among three different fields can be allowed already at the trilinear level , hence the `` const '' term in eq .  .",
    "is suppressed if e.g. ( as required in the previous section ) @xmath14 is vectorlike , unless @xmath6 is a gauge singlet .",
    "we have verified that such singlets do not appear in the mini - landscape models . ]    therefore , typically @xmath53 while @xmath8 can be order one . if the `` const '' term in eq .",
    "vanishes due to string selection rules , then @xmath8 is also suppressed .",
    "we thus are led to two distinct versions of the nmssm : the `` decoupling '' ( @xmath54 ) and the peccei - quinn scenarios ( @xmath53 ) , which we now discuss .",
    "\\1 ) _ decoupling limit_. for @xmath54 , the singlet essentially decouples and the nmssm degenerates into a version of the mssm , albeit with modifications in the neutralino sector .",
    "the dominant terms for large @xmath45 in the potential   are @xmath55 for @xmath56 , there is a local minimum at @xmath57 . in the decoupling limit",
    ", @xmath45 can take very large vevs and still satisfy the chargino mass bound , @xmath58ew , thus solving the @xmath0problem .",
    "we then have @xmath59 .",
    "the difference from the mssm resides in the neutralino sector : the fermionic component of @xmath6 has mass @xmath60 and can be the lsp .",
    "the nlsp decays are then suppressed by the small coupling @xmath8 leading to its long lifetime with characteristic signatures such as displaced vertices @xcite .",
    "\\2 ) _ peccei ",
    "quinn limit_. for @xmath53 @xcite , the model possesses an approximate pq symmetry @xmath61 ,",
    "spontaneous breaking of this symmetry generates a pseudo ",
    "goldstone boson ( axion ) .",
    "the composition of this state is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 ,  and @xmath65 are defined by @xmath66 .",
    "as usual , @xmath67 and @xmath68 gev .",
    "since the pq is only slightly broken , @xmath69 can get a rather small mass - square of order @xmath70 .",
    "\\(a ) + @xmath71{eebbz.eps}}}}$ ]    \\(b ) + @xmath72{ee4fz.eps}}}}$ ]    as in the previous case , the @xmath0problem is solved because @xmath45 can be stabilized at values around ( or larger than ) the ew scale .",
    "in addition , the presence of a light axion  like state can be relevant to the mssm fine - tuning problem @xcite . typically , @xmath73 , so that the axion is predominantly an ew singlet .",
    "its couplings to quarks and gauge bosons are suppressed , but the coupling to the higgs bosons is significant .",
    "thus the sm - like higgs @xmath9 can decay into pairs of @xmath74 which would subsequently decay into 4 fermions .",
    "if @xmath75 , the dominant decay channel at lep @xmath76 would be overwhelmed by @xmath77 , with @xmath78 denoting light quarks ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ssmhiggsdecay ] ) . under these conditions",
    ", the lep bound on the higgs mass relaxes to about 105 gev for the final state taus and 90 gev for the final state quarks  @xcite .",
    "this ameliorates ( or even eliminates ) the mssm fine - tuning problem since the superpartners are not required to be very heavy to accommodate the lep higgs bound .    to obtain an example of the nmssm from the mini ",
    "landscape models , one needs to impose the extra requirement that there exist at least one massless singlet which couples to the higgs pair .",
    "this condition turns out to be very restrictive . in particular , among the models with 2 wilson lines of ref .",
    "@xcite there are no nmssm examples because all sm singlets are decoupled once the exotics acquire large masses . however , many models with 3 wilson lines of ref .  @xcite lead to the most appealing scenario : the pq limit of the nmssm .    in the particular model discussed in  @xcite , the unbroken gauge group after solving the susy constraints is @xmath79 $ ] , where the gauge factors in parenthesis are hidden , in the sense that this sector communicates to the sm sector only through gravitational interactions .",
    "the matter content includes three generations of quarks and leptons , very heavy vectorlike exotics , and an additional massless singlet @xmath6 with the couplings @xmath80 for @xmath81 , @xmath82 and the system has an approximate pq symmetry , whose spontaneous breaking results in a light pseudoscalar state @xmath69 .",
    "its mass depends on the order of the allowed coupling as well as the exact value of @xmath23 and can be light enough to be relevant to the mssm fine - tuning problem . in this model choosing @xmath83 and minimizing the potential   leads to @xmath84 mev and a @xmath0term of about the right size .",
    "the solutions to the @xmath0problem addressed here in the context of string - derived models rely on supplementary symmetries of the theory .",
    "these symmetries are frequently artificial elements from the low energy perspective .",
    "however , particularly in heterotic orbifolds , they are consequences of the stringy uv completion of these effective theories . unlike in field theories",
    ", no symmetry is put by hand . the @xmath13 symmetry necessary to solve the @xmath0problem in sec .",
    "[ sec : muinmssm ] and the pq symmetry that yields @xmath85 in the string - derived nmssm of sec .",
    "[ sec : nmssm ] are the result of the string selection rules together with our vacuum selection .",
    "also , in the string nmssm the absence or suppression of the @xmath51 term has to do with the fact that @xmath6 is charged under additional gauge symmetries .",
    "similarly , the vectorlikeness of the operator @xmath14 is a result of the stringy origin of the symmetries of the model .",
    "the explicit breaking of the approximate symmetries we have studied cures some of their usual problems when they are exact . for instance , the @xmath86 symmetry of the nmssm is broken by a small supersymmetric mass term for the singlet .",
    "this helps avoid cosmological problems , such as domain walls .",
    "further , the explicit breaking of the @xmath13 needed for solving the @xmath0problem in the mssm renders heavy an otherwise massless goldstone boson of the theory .",
    "let us conclude by noting that the models we discussed here are also embedded with seesaw masses , low - energy susy breaking , nontrivial quark and lepton masses , order one top yukawa coupling and other attractive features .",
    "it seems then that the conjecture that our universe might well be described by compact singular spaces rather than smooth manifolds  @xcite should not be ignored and can not be ruled out .",
