    "molecular outflows are one of the first manifestations of the formation of a new star .",
    "they are thought to play an essential role in the removal of angular momentum from collapsing dense cores , which eventually enable them to contract to stellar sizes .",
    "although the details remain unclear , the general consensus is that outflows are driven by rotating magnetic fields anchored to the disk - star system @xcite .",
    "accretion disks are known to rotate , so the material ejected from them should inherit a toroidal angular momentum component @xcite . indeed , observational evidence for this component have been presented for several outflows driven by young stellar objects @xcite .    arguably the most direct evidence has been presented by launhardt et al .",

    "their @xmath0co(2 - 1 ) line observations revealed the presence of a systematic velocity gradient perpendicular to the flow axis along its entire length .",
    "zapata et al ( 2010 ) , on the other hand , reported three independent @xmath0co(2 - 1 ) and so(6 - 5 ) observations toward the ori - s6 molecular outflow .",
    "all three observations revealed velocity asymmetries about the outflow axis which are suggestive of rotation at different size scales .",
    "ic 348 is a young star cluster ( @xmath2 2 myr ) located near the eastern edge of the perseus dark cloud complex at about 300 pc from the sun ( muench et al .",

    "it contains more than a dozen protostars , many of them driving outflows .",
    "the ic 348-mms / smm2 source is a dense condensation within that region which drives a large collimated north - south co ouflow @xcite .",
    "the optical and infrared counterpart of this molecular outflow is the herbig - haro system hh 797 @xcite .",
    "the low radial velocities displayed by the outflow ( blue to the north and red to the south ) and its large extension ( @xmath2 0.5 pc ) suggest that it is nearly in the plane of the sky .    in this study , we present millimeter observations , made with the submillimeter array ( sma ) , of the ic 348-mms / smm2 object and its associated hh 797 outflow .",

    "the sma digital correlator was configured in 24 spectral windows ( `` chunks '' ) of 104 mhz and 128 channels each .",

    "this irac band contains several h@xmath16 transitions which trace shock - excited material @xcite associated ( in the present case ) with the supersonic flow in hh 797 .",
    "this image reveals the highly collimated outflow ( with an opening angle of about 6@xmath17 at a position angle of @xmath1830@xmath17 ) already mapped in co lines by @xcite at a lower spatial resolution . from our observations ,",
    "it is evident that the @xmath0co(2 - 1 ) emission traces the innermost portion ( @xmath2 0.1 pc ) of the outflow .",
    "the blueshifted radial velocities run from @xmath182 to @xmath198 km s@xmath1 and the redshifted ones from @xmath1910 to @xmath1920 km s@xmath1 ; the systemic lsr radial velocity of the ambient molecular cloud is at about @xmath19 9 km s@xmath1 .",
    "these velocity ranges are in very good agreement with those reported by @xcite .",
    "most of the receding radial velocities ( redshifted ) of the outflow are located toward the south , while the approaching radial velocities ( blueshifted ) are toward the north .",
    "we note that the optical and infrared components of hh 797 have been extensively discussed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the outflow emanates from ic 348-mms / smm2 , a class 0 object @xcite .",
    "our observations resolve the dust emission from this source , with a deconvolved size of ( 3.0@xmath20 ) @xmath12 ( 1.5@xmath21 ) , at p.a .",
    "@xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "this implies a physical size of about 900 @xmath12 450 au ( assuming a distance of 300 pc ) and an orientation almost exactly perpendicular to the outflow axis .",
    "the source is centered at the @xmath4 = @xmath24 , @xmath6 = @xmath25 and has a flux density at 1.4 mm of 220 @xmath26 15 mjy .",
    "assuming optically thin isothermal dust emission , a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 , a dust temperature of 40 k , a dust mass opacity @xmath27 = 1 @xmath28 g@xmath1 , and an emissivity index @xmath29 , we estimate a total mass for the source of 0.09 m@xmath30 .",
    "this combination of properties suggest that the emission seen at 1.4 mm is dominated by the accretion disk , although a contribution from the inner envelope might also be present . in objects where the masses of the disks and central stars have been estimated , they usually are in a ratio of order m@xmath31/m@xmath32 @xmath2 10 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the central protostar in ic 348-mms / smm2 is roughly of solar mass .",
    "we searched for a centimeter counterpart using the very large array archive data from project s9056 , taken on 2008 march 13 , 14 , 18 and 19 .",
    "we did not detect a source , setting 4-@xmath33 upper limits of 0.05 and 0.06 mjy at 4.86 and 8.46 ghz , respectively .    in figure 2 , we present the intensity - weighted velocity map of the @xmath0co(2 - 1 ) emission , which confirms that most of the redshifted velocities are found to the south , while the blueshifted velocities are to the north .",
    "interestingly , this figure also shows a clear gradient _ across _ the outflow , detected along the entire length of the flow .",
    "this gradient is such that , at a given distance from the protostar , the velocity of the gas near the eastern edge of the jet is systematically more red - shifted than that of the gas on the western edge .",
    "this asymmetry is confirmed by the position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams for four cuts across the outflow ( figure 3 ) , which reveal the spatial structure of the gas across the flow as a function of the radial velocities .",
    "one can observe that in all cases , a `` v''-shape ( or , perhaps , more accurately , a triangular shape ) velocity pattern is apparent .",
    "near the axis of the jet , high and low velocities coexist , extending from the systemic velocity up to about @xmath19 2 km s@xmath1 on the north ( blue ) side and about @xmath19 16 km s@xmath1 on the south ( red ) side . in contrast , near the edges of the flow , only comparatively low velocities are detected .",
    "if the velocity of the gas were parallel to the direction of the outflow , one would expect these v shapes to be symmetric with respect to the axis of the flow . in the present case , however , there is a clear asymmetry .",
    "consider , for instance , the cuts at positions b1 and b2 . near the western edge ( at angular offset @xmath34 ) , the bulk gas is at a velocity of about @xmath19 8 km s@xmath1 ( i.e.  slightly below the systemic velocity , as appropriate for the blue side ) . but near the eastern edge ( angular offset @xmath35 ) , the gas reaches redshifted velocity of about @xmath19 11 km s@xmath1 .",
    "similar patterns are seen at positions r1 and r2 and have been reported in two other collimated outflows ( orion - s6 and hh 212 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where they have been interpreted as evidence for outflow rotation . in the present case ,",
    "the amplitude of the velocity asymmetry is about 2 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we should mention , finally , that the structure of the emission at the systemic velocity ( where the outflow emission is blended with the extended ambient emission ) is poorly reconstructed by our interferometric data .",
    "the apparent lack of continuity in the pv diagrams at velocity @xmath19 9 km s@xmath1 is a result of this effect .",
    "the most natural interpretation of the velocity asymmetries observed here is jet rotation .",
    "let us , however , consider and discuss alternative explanations . the most obvious alternate interpretation would be that the flow driven by ic 348-mms / smm2 is in fact the superposition of two nearly parallel outflows , not spatially resolved by our observations , and powered by a central tight binary system . in a recent study , @xcite present a model of such a situation , and show that the parallel outflows eventually merge , resulting in a persistent kink in the final structure .",
    "moreover , the precession induced by the binarity quickly lead to bending jet trajectories . although they can not be entirely ruled out ,",
    "neither of these effects are apparent in our sma data .",
    "in addition , there is currently no independent direct evidence supporting the binarity of ic 348-mms / smm2 .",
    "a second possibility to consider is that of a precessing ( non - rotating ) jet / outflow system .",
    "this possibility would naturally fit with the `` wavy '' morphology of the outflow at large distances from the source , as revealed at infrared wavelengths ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "this situation might plausibly mimic rotation because the jet would be the superposition of successive events where gas was ejected in different directions at different times .",
    "such a scenario , however , does not easily explain the symmetric v - shape morphology seen in the pv diagrams of hh 797 ( which are consistent , instead , with a high velocity jet along the outflow axis ) .",
    "in addition , precession should produce a point - symmetric situation : if the asymmetries were east to west along the blue outflow lobe , they should be west to east along the red lobe . in the present case , however , the asymmetry is consistently east to west along the entire length of the flow .    since alternative interpretations fail to reproduce the observed kinematics of the hh 797 flow , we interpret the observed velocity asymmetries as rotation .",
    "considering the situation where a jet is launched from a rotating protostellar disk and then accelerated and collimated by mhd forces , @xcite provide a formula relating the jet properties measured at large distances from the disk to the position ( the `` footpoint '' ) on the disk where the jet is anchored .",
    "@xmath36    here @xmath37 is the observed radial distance of the jet shell from the flow axis , @xmath38 the radius on the disk from where that shell s material leaves , v@xmath39 and v@xmath40 are the toroidal and poloidal velocities observed for the shell at @xmath37 , and @xmath41 the mass of the ( proto)star at the center of the disk . in this case , we assume from observation @xmath37 @xmath2 1000 au ( about 4@xmath42 ) , v@xmath39 @xmath2 2 km s@xmath1*cos @xmath43 , v@xmath40 @xmath2 10/sin @xmath43 km s@xmath1 and @xmath41 @xmath2 1 m@xmath30 , with @xmath43 the unknown angle between flow direction and plane of the sky .",
    "this results in a footpoint radius of 100*(sin @xmath44*(cos @xmath45 au .",
    "since the apparent poloidal flow velocity of @xmath2 10 km s@xmath1 relative to ambient is relatively low , it seems likely that @xmath43 is small . for @xmath46 20@xmath17 the footpoint radius would drop to below 20 au , a reasonable value that fits with the innermost part of the above - mentioned disk dimensions .",
    "the value @xmath37 = 20 au is very similar to the one found by @xcite for the rotating outflow ori - s6 energized by the young class 0 protostar 139 - 409 and the one estimated by @xcite for the the outflow cb 26 powered by a more evolved low - mass t - tauri star . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite have found much smaller values for @xmath37 in outflows powered for both class 0/1 protostars .",
    "thus , at this point , we can not role out any conclusion about the variation of @xmath37 with time or some similarities on these values .",
    "in this paper , we have reported @xmath0co(2 - 1 ) line observation of hh 797 , and discovered velocity asymmetries about the flow axis with an amplitude roughly on the order of 2 km s@xmath1 over distances of about 1000 au .",
    "the same velocity asymmetries are found on both sides of the outflow , and we interpret them as evidence for jet rotation , thus , hh 797 appears to be promising laboratory for future studies of magneto - centrifugal models of jet acceleration .",
