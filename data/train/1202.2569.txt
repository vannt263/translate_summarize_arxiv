    "moreover , einstein s relative motion as depicted by special relativity is supported on minkowski spacetime , and the geodesic motion of free particles and of light rays in general relativity takes place on the pseudo - riemannian metric manifold @xmath0 with lorentzian signature where the theory is formulated .    nevertheless , to the author s knowledge , no description of motion exists which is properly adapted to the characteristic geometrical structure of gauge theories of gravitation .",
    "certainly , a reason for it can be found in the fact that the considerable effort made along the years in the construction of such gravitational theories of the yang - mills type @xcite@xcite has produced a number of quite different proposals .",
    "being all of them gauge theoretical approaches , they have in common the fiber bundle nature @xcite@xcite , but no further agreement exists , neither in the choice of the structure group nor in the particular bundle structure invoked by each one .",
    "einstein s general relativity can be interpreted , at least in principle , in terms of tensor quantities defined on a tensor bundle associated to the principal bundle of ( tangent ) linear frames lm with @xmath1 as structure group @xcite@xcite .",

    "lord @xcite@xcite proposes the principal bundle structure @xmath6 with @xmath7poincar and @xmath8 the lorentz subgroup @xmath5 , where he accommodates his particular conception of gauge transformations as non - vertical automorphisms .",

    ", translational symmetry is treated like ordinary gauge symmetries , and tetrads become identified with ( nonlinear ) translational connections with the right gauge transformations .",

    "see appendix a.    the aim of the present work is to show that , at least in the particular case of composite fiber bundles proposed by the author as the suitable geometrical framework for poincar gauge theory , a description of motion exists which is modeled by its necessary adaptation to the bundle structure underlying this gauge theory of gravitation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sections ii ",
    "iv , we review the main features of the poincar composite bundle structure constituting the necessary support for the subsequent development . we include several improvements and extensions as compared with the original exposition of ref.@xcite . in particular",
    ", a 5-dimensional matrix representation of the poincar group is introduced . in section",
    "v , we construct the basis vectors of the @xmath12-associated 5-d vector bundle , assuming the vector fifth component to play the role of an origin . in sections",
    "vi and vii , we discuss the bundle tangent space , where we pay special attention to a certain set of four tangent vectors . after enlarging them with a point",
    ", we propose to regard the resulting 5-dimensional set as a poincar frame , consisting of the basis components of a 5-d vector representation space of the poincar group .",
    "then , the composite bundle structure allows to define in a natural way an invariant point - like quantity @xmath13 which in a certain sector of the tangent space provides a local description of positions referred to the local poincar frames previously built .",
    "section viii is devoted to deal with different aspects of time evolution as induced by a ( timelike ) vector field @xmath14 constituting the generator of the flow of events .",
    "so , we perform a simultaneity defining foliation ( related to a certain time connection ) and we examine the various appearances of the timelike vector field playing the role of both , time and fourvelocity when expressed in terms of fields characteristic for the underlying bundle structure . in particular , we find that the fourvelocity components take the form of a poincar covariant generalization of the lie derivative of certain translational fields resembling the spacetime coordinates of special relativity . finally , after reformulating geodesic motion as induced by @xmath14 on @xmath13 , in section ix we apply our view to test particles orbiting on a schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "the conclusions are found in section x.",
    "ordinary gauge theories of internal groups @xmath15 have the geometrical structure of principal bundles @xmath11 , where the base space @xmath16 represents spacetime and the connections defining horizontality on the bundle manifest themselves physically as gauge potentials describing interactions ; matter fields are defined on associated bundles @xcite@xcite @xcite .",
    "however , this bundle scheme fails in accomodating gauge theories of spacetime groups . in ref.@xcite ,",

    "this conception of @xmath84 derives in a natural way from gauge theories of internal groups , appropriate to describe any forces other than gravity .",
    "however , as observed by e. a. lord @xcite@xcite , the characterization of gauge transformations as vertical bundle automorphisms fails for gauge theories of spacetime groups : mainly for those based on groups including translations , such as pgt and mag , where the group action on spacetime positions , usually represented by coordinates , must be taken into account . accordingly , in order to extend to spacetime groups the validity of gauge transformations , lord proposed to renounce to the verticality condition ( [ gautrans02 ] ) , thus allowing the existence of nonvertical gauge transformations inducing diffeomorphisms on @xmath16 . as a consequence of his view on gauge transformations",

    "we replace in ( [ nlr04 ] ) the infinitesimal group elements @xmath509 of the poincar group and @xmath510 of the homogeneous lorentz group , and we parametrize @xmath70 and @xmath511 respectively as @xmath512 with finite translational parameters @xmath242 , and @xmath513 then , making use of the poincar commutation relations ( [ lor])([trans ] ) , with the help of the hausdorff - campbell formulas @xmath514}\\,,\\label{formula06}\\\\ e^{i\\,\\xi ^\\nu p_\\nu}\\,p_\\mu\\,e^{-i\\,\\xi ^\\nu p_\\nu } & = & p_\\mu\\,,\\label{formula07}\\\\ e^{-i\\,{(\\,\\xi ^\\nu + \\delta\\xi ^\\nu ) } p_\\nu } & \\approx & e^{-i\\,\\xi ^\\nu p_\\nu } + \\delta\\,e^{-i\\,\\xi ^\\nu p_\\nu}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & e^{-i\\,\\xi ^\\nu p_\\nu}\\left(\\,1+e^{i\\,\\xi ^\\nu p_\\nu}\\,\\delta e^{-i\\,\\xi ^\\nu p_\\nu}\\,\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & e^{-i\\,\\xi ^\\nu p_\\nu}\\left(\\,1 -i\\,\\delta\\xi ^\\nu p_\\nu\\,\\right)\\,,\\label{formula08}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq.([nlr04 ] ) yields on the one hand the value @xmath515 for the @xmath22-parameter , and on the other hand the variations @xmath516 of the translational parameters @xmath242 . observe how the transformations ( [ 5dpoinc42 ] ) resemble those of cartesian coordinates .    on the other hand , ( [ varlcon ] ) applied to ( [ pbconn04 ] ) with ( [ formula02 ] ) yields @xmath517 and @xmath518 while ( [ varnlcon ] ) applied to ( [ nlinconn2 ] ) with ( [ formula03 ] ) and ( [ 5dpoinc41 ] ) gives rise to ( [ varlorconn ] ) , as before , and to @xmath519 which is the variation of ( [ variety05 ] ) with ( [ variety06 ] ) ( or of ( [ variety06bis ] ) ) .",
    "in @xcite and @xcite , a nonlinear approach to pgt was proposed with @xmath7poincar and @xmath520 . a bundle interpretation of such alternative treatment of the poincar group would require to reelaborate several details of the scheme developed in the present paper .",
    "we wo nt do it here , but in order to clarify certain points discussed in the main text we recall how to derive the @xmath521 quantities ( [ hattheta0 ] ) , ( [ hatthetaa ] ) ) , related to our translational connection ( [ connform4 ] ) by a gauge - analogous transformation involving goldstone boost fields rather than gauge group parameters . by decomposing the lorentz generators @xmath125 into boosts @xmath522 and space rotations @xmath523 ,",

    "( [ hattheta0])([hatthetaa ] ) are definitions of new variables whose transformation properties depend on ( [ app2.90 ] ) . for the quantities defined in ( [ app2.15 ] )",

    "in the main text , we repeatedly make use of equation @xmath545 relating , by means of the interior product , pullbacks and pushforwards acting respectively on differential forms @xmath546 and vectors @xmath258 . together with ( [ aux01 ] )",
