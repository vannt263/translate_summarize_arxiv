    "entanglement is a fundamental quantum mechanical resource that plays a pivotal role in many of the most interesting applications of quantum computation and quantum information @xcite . as a central concept ,",
    "entanglement run counter to the intuition , for example , the famous schr@xmath3dinger - cat gedanken experiment @xcite .",
    "while it predicts quantum mechanics in principle allows superpositions of macroscopic states .",
    "recently , in the setting of the hilbert space of @xmath0 two - level systems , fr@xmath3wis and d@xmath4r @xcite study the stability of superpositions of macroscopical quantum states under decoherence . in their letter",
    "the authors introduce a class of quantum states , namely , the concatenated ghz ( c - ghz ) states and discuss a possible experimental realization of the c - ghz states using trapped ions based on the multipartite m@xmath5lmer - s@xmath5rensen gate @xcite . the so - called c - ghz state which is robust against noise and decoherence",
    "is defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 are @xmath1-ghz states as maximally entangled states in @xmath1-qubit systems @xcite and @xmath2 is the number of logical qubits , each built of @xmath1 physical qubits .",
    "further , through a comparison with different encodings ( ghz encoding , cluster states encoding and product state encoding ) , it has been shown that concatenated ghz encoding is in fact optimal for the stability of the trace norm of the interference terms @xcite .",
    "in other words , there are superior stability for the c - ghz states .",
    "optical quantum systems are prominent candidates for quantum computation and quantum information @xcite , since the photon , the smallest unit of quantum information , is potentially free from decoherence . because photons do not naturally interact with each other , the key challenge in simulating quantum systems is the construction of two - qubit ( multi - qubit ) quantum operations , for example , controlled - not gate . as a matter of fact , one can induce an effective interaction between photons by making projective measurements with photodetectors . in 2001 , knill _ et al _ @xcite showed a scheme for efficient quantum computation with linear optics , where the probabilistic two - photon gates were teleported into a quantum circuit with high probability .",
    "alternatively , using weak cross - kerr nonlinearities @xcite , one can induce the requisite interaction between the photons , such as , nearly deterministic linear optical controlled - not gate @xcite , the deterministic multi - control gates @xcite , and so on .    in this paper , we focus on the possible experimental realization of the @xmath0-photon c - ghz states .",
    "we first introduce an entangler of @xmath1-photon polarization qubits based on weak nonlinearities .",
    "then two schemes are explored : one is creating the @xmath0-photon c - ghz state from a @xmath0-photon ghz state and the other is combining @xmath2 @xmath1-photon ghz states into the desired state .",
    "one of the major ingredient in the present schemes is the entangler of @xmath1-photon ghz state introduced in @xcite . in order to meet the needs of the context ,",
    "now we describe the mentioned entangler , briefly , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "consider the initial state @xmath8^{\\otimes m}$ ] containing @xmath1 photons ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) , where the qubits are encoded with the polarization modes @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "together with the coherent probe beam @xmath15 , the whole combined system can be evolved into @xmath16/\\sqrt{2^m},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by using linear optical elements and cross - kerr nonlinear media .",
    "the linear optical elements are consisted of polarizing beam splitters ( pbss ) , which are used to transmit the @xmath17 polarization photons and reflect the @xmath18 polarization photons , and phase shifter @xmath19 . after the following @xmath20 quadrature homodyne measurement @xcite on the probe beam and subsequent local operations ( a phase shift operation @xmath21 corresponding to the value of the homodyne measurement and some selective bit - flip operations @xmath22 ) , according to the classical feed - forward , the initial state can be converted to the @xmath1-photon ghz state @xmath23 . in addition , if @xmath1 is odd and the initial state is @xmath24 , we noticed that one can obtain the state @xmath25 , accordingly .",
    "-photon ghz state.,title=\"fig:\",width=432 ] +    -photon c - ghz state from a @xmath0-photon ghz state .",
    "@xmath0 photons are divided into @xmath2 partitions , each partition can be considered as a logical qubit built of @xmath1 physical qubits.,title=\"fig:\",width=211 ] +    now we design a setup to generate the @xmath0-photon c - ghz state by using the entanglers of @xmath1-photon ghz state , where @xmath1 is odd , as shown in fig.[c - ghz-1 ] . we first suppose that a @xmath0-photon ghz state has been generated in the form of @xmath26 . later on , one @xmath27 operation , which evolves the single - photon state @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 ) into the state @xmath30 ( or @xmath31 ) and can be performed by a half - wave plate ( the angle between its axis and the horizontal direction is @xmath32 ) , acts on each photon , respectively . as a result ,",
    "@xmath0 @xmath27 operations transform the state @xmath26 to @xmath33^{\\otimes km } + [ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } ( \\left|h \\right\\rangle- \\left|v \\right\\rangle)]^{\\otimes km}\\}$ ] . at last , we make use of @xmath2 @xmath1-photon ghz entanglers . in the light of the action of the @xmath1-photon ghz entangler , obviously , the desired @xmath0-photon c - ghz state can be created under the condition that @xmath1 is odd , as we mentioned above .",
    "generally , we can also create @xmath0-photon c - ghz states ( as shown in fig.[c - ghz-2 ] ) from @xmath0 single - photon states @xmath8^{\\otimes km}$ ] by using @xmath2 entanglers of @xmath1-photon ghz state @xcite and @xmath2 @xmath1-control toffoli gates @xcite . in order to simplify the following discussion ,",
    "let us now rewrite two @xmath0-photon c - ghz states as @xmath34\\equiv|\\phi_{\\texttt{even}}\\rangle,\\ ] ] @xmath35\\equiv|\\phi_{\\texttt{odd}}\\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the @xmath0-photon c - ghz state which only contains even ( or null ) number of components of @xmath37 for each basis of product states , while @xmath38 is one with only odd @xmath37 .",
    "more specifically , we first divide the input state into @xmath2 units , each consists of @xmath1 single - photon product state @xmath8^{\\otimes m}$ ] .",
    "followed by @xmath2 entanglers of @xmath1-photon ghz state , respectively , one can now create @xmath2 @xmath1-photon ghz states @xmath39^{\\otimes k}$ ] .",
    "then , we introduce an auxiliary single - photon state @xmath40 as the target photon to construct @xmath2 @xmath1-control toffoli gates . the @xmath1-control toffoli gate performs a not gate operation ( @xmath22 ) on target photon @xmath41 , controlled by @xmath1-control photons , i.e. , @xmath42\\otimes ( |h\\rangle_{t}\\langle h|+ |v\\rangle_{t}\\langle v|)+ |vv\\cdots v\\rangle_{12\\cdots m}\\langle vv\\cdots v| \\otimes ( |h\\rangle_{t}\\langle v|+ |v\\rangle_{t}\\langle h|)$ ] .",
    "after the actions of @xmath1-control toffoli gates , at last , a single - photon detection is made on the auxiliary photon in the \\{@xmath43 } basis .",
    "the single - photon detection can project the combined system onto two expected subspaces , i.e. , the states @xmath36 and @xmath38 with equal probability . in other words , corresponding to the click of @xmath44 or @xmath45 , the state @xmath46 or @xmath47 is prepared , alternatively .",
    "-photon c - ghz states based on @xmath1-control toffoli gates.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ] +",
    "we design two setups to create the desired @xmath0-photon c - ghz states from @xmath0-photon ghz state and @xmath0 single - photon product state respectively .",
    "a group of entanglers of @xmath1-photon ghz state are introduced in the two schemes , where the cross - kerr nonlinear media play an important role in experimental realization . in the regime of weak nonlinearity ,",
    "@xmath48 , there is a difficulty for larger value @xmath1 since with the increase of @xmath1 the entangler requires exponentially many nonlinear interactions . if we consider a block size of @xmath49 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , however , the present schemes are feasible with current techniques @xcite . in addition , in our second scheme we use @xmath1-control toffoli gates which generally requires @xmath50 two - qubit gates @xcite . with the control photons being @xmath1-photon ghz state , in present scheme",
    "we directly utilize the existing @xmath1-control toffoli gate @xcite since it has been shown that the deterministic optical toffoli gate only uses the resources increasing linearly with the size of an input . in summary , we develop two methods for preparing a class of multipartite entangled states ",
    "the @xmath0-photon c - ghz states , which remain superior stability under the influence of decoherence so that distinct quantum effects might be observed at macroscopic scale .",
