    "multifractal models were first introduced in the 1960s by the so - called `` russian school '' in turbulence theory @xcite . in turbulence , multifractality can be conceived as a weakening of the spatial selfsimilarity in the velocity field implicitly assumed in kolmogorov s 1941-theory @xcite .",
    "this generalization is called the kolmogorov - obukhov model and entails modeling the spatial variability of the energy dissipation rate as a random measure with certain multi - scaling properties .",
    "the kolmogorov - obukhov model is treated rigorously by kahane @xcite and this construction is known as gaussian multiplicative chaos .    in recent years multifractal random processes and multifractal random measures have received increased attention and are widely used in physics , geophysics and complex systems theory .",
    "examples include phenomena as diverse as internet traffic @xcite , geomagnetic activity @xcite and rainfall patterns @xcite .",
    "in addition , multifractal processes provide natural models for the long - range volatility persistence observed in financial time series .",
    "this was first discovered by ghashghaie @xcite and mandelbrot @xcite , and since the late 1990s much work has been done on multifractal modeling of financial markets @xcite .",
    "logarithmic returns of assets are modeled as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 are continuous - time processes with stationary increments and multifractal scaling .",
    "the latter means that the moments of @xmath1 are power - laws as functions of time ; @xmath2 either in some interval @xmath3 or asymptotically as @xmath4 .",
    "the scaling function @xmath5 is linear for self - similar processes , but may in general be concave .",
    "processes satisfying equation ( [ eq1 ] ) with strictly concave scaling functions are generally referred to as multifractal .",
    "two well - known `` stylized facts '' of financial time series are that log - returns are uncorrelated and non - gaussian .",
    "based on this , mandelbrot @xcite deduced that if prices are described as selfsimilar processes , then these processes must be so - called lvy flights , i.e. @xmath6-stable lvy processes with @xmath7 .",
    "however , if one allows non - linear scaling functions , then one can maintain uncorrelated log - returns by simply imposing the condition @xmath8 .",
    "the concave shape of @xmath5 implies that the variables @xmath1 are increasingly leptokurtic with decreasing @xmath9 , and consequently non - gaussian .",
    "moreover , as opposed to lvy flights , multifractal processes have strongly dependent increments and can therefore describe a third `` stylized fact '' of financial time series , namely volatility clustering .    notwithstanding that multifractal processes provide accurate and parsimonious descriptions of temporal financial fluctuations ,",
    "the models are rarely implemented for forecasting and risk - analysis in financial institutions .",
    "this is partially due to a lack of accurate , stable and efficient inference methods for multifractal processes .",
    "parameter estimation has so far mostly been made using various moment - based estimators , such as the generalized method of moments ( gmm ) .",
    "alternatively , one can fit the estimated scaling functions to theoretical expressions of @xmath5 .",
    "however , as pointed out in e.g. @xcite and @xcite , the standard estimators of scaling exponents have large mean square errors for time series of length comparable to those typically available in econometrics .    an exception to the statements above",
    "is the markov - switching multifractal ( msm ) model @xcite where maximum likelihood estimation is feasible . in discrete time",
    "msm implies that the increments @xmath10 are described by a stochastic volatility model on the form @xmath11 here @xmath12 are independent variables and the volatility is a product on the form @xmath13 where ( for each time step @xmath9 ) @xmath14 are updated from a distribution @xmath15 with a probability @xmath16 . in this model",
    "however , maximum likelihood estimation is only possible in the case where @xmath15 is defined on a discrete state space , and there is a limitation on the magnitude of @xmath17 which should not exceed @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "these restrictions not only limit flexibility with respect to the distribution of returns , but also the possible range in the volatility dependency .    this paper concerns parametric inference for the multifractal random walk ( mrw ) introduced by bacry et al .",
    "the increment process @xmath19 is still a discrete - time stochastic process described by equation ( [ msm ] ) , but now the volatility is modeled as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a stationary and centered gaussian process with the co - variance structure @xmath22 where @xmath23 . here @xmath24 is called the correlation range corresponds to the integral scale . ] and @xmath25 is called the intermittency parameter . the constant @xmath26 ensures normalization and is chosen so that @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "we denote @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29 denote the parameter vector and @xmath30 a fixed time series .",
    "the main result of this paper is the development of a method for efficiently computing approximations to the likelihood function @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the probability density function of a random vector @xmath33 produced by the mrw model with parameters @xmath34 . using the likelihood function",
    ", parameters can be determined by means of the maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimator : @xmath35    our method exploits that the discrete mrw model has a construction similar to simple volatility ( sv ) models .",
    "the distinguishing feature is that the processes @xmath21 are autoregressive in sv models . by truncating the dependency structure in the logarithmic volatility @xmath21 ,",
    "the computation of the likelihood function is mapped on to a similar problem for sv models , and hence existing techniques for further approximations are available .    to our knowledge",
    "the present paper is the first to present results on ml estimation for multifractal models with continuous state spaces for the volatility .",
    "such estimates may be of great practical importance , since accurate parameter estimation is essential for volatility forecasts and risk estimates . in the mrw model",
    "this degree of accuracy is particularly important for the intermittency parameter @xmath36 which determines the peakedness of the return distributions on all time scales . in applications other than finance",
    ", accurate estimates of @xmath36 can be used as supplements to the empirical scaling functions , and thereby the ml estimator can provide a tool for quantifying multifractality in data .    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we briefly explain the construction of the continuous - time process @xmath1 for which the model given by equations ( [ msm ] ) and ( [ defmod2 ] ) is a discretization . there exists a large class of multifractal processes which are related to a construction known as infinitely divisible cascades ( idc ) . in general the random walk models associated with idc processes have logartithmic volatility with infinitely divisible distributions , and the mrw model considered in this paper is a discrete approximation to the random walk model obtained in the special case when the logarithmic volatility is gaussian .    section [ method ] contains the procedure for approximated ml estimation in the mrw model . in section [ montecarlo ]",
    "we test the estimator by first applying it to various stock market indices , and then by running a small monte carlo study .",
    "the results are compared with the gmm method used in @xcite .",
    "we finally remark that the methods presented in this paper have been implemented in a package for the r statistical software @xcite .",
    "this package is available online @xcite .",
    "there exist several popular models for multifractal stochastic processes with uncorrelated increments .",
    "all of these models can be written either on the form @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a brownian motion and @xmath39)$ ] is the distribution function of a multifractal random measure @xmath40 on the time axis , or as @xmath41 where @xmath42 as @xmath43 .",
    "the meaning of @xmath44 is discussed below .",
    "these two types of constructions are equivalent as long as @xmath38 is a brownian motion .",
    "( this is not the case for fractional brownian motions with @xmath45 . )    the differences between the various multifractal models are then related to the construction of the random measure @xmath40 .",
    "the log - normal mrw model is on one hand based on a particular construction of @xmath40 known as multiplicative chaos , and on the other hand it can be seen as a special case of the more general idc constructions .    in multiplicative chaos , which was first developed rigorously in @xcite ,",
    "one considers a sequence @xmath46 of measures defined via random densities on the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 $ ] , and @xmath49 are centered gaussian processes with co - variance structures @xmath50 that converge to some expression @xmath51 in the limit @xmath52 .",
    "kahane @xcite showed that if @xmath53 is @xmath54-positive , meaning that there are positive and positive definite functions @xmath55 such that @xmath56 then the sequence @xmath46 converges weakly to a borel measure @xmath40 which depends only on the function @xmath51 .",
    "one can therefore informally think of @xmath40 as being on the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 $ ] and @xmath59 is a `` gaussian '' process with co - variance @xmath51 .",
    "then , if one makes the choice @xmath60 one easily obtains the relation @xmath61 , where @xmath62 are independent of @xmath59 and distributed according to @xmath63 .",
    "it follows that we for @xmath64 and @xmath65 have the scaling relation @xmath66\\right){\\stackrel{d}{=}}m(a)m([0,t ] ) \\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath67 .",
    "see proposition 3.3 in @xcite for a rigorous proof of ( [ scaling1 ] ) , and see example 2.3 of the same paper for a verification that the function @xmath51 in equation ( [ covar ] ) is @xmath54-positive . by using the well - known formula for the @xmath68-th moments of log - normal variables together with equation ( [ scaling1 ] )",

    "since a brownian motion is self - similar with @xmath72 the scaling function of @xmath1 is given by @xmath73 .",
    "alternatively the model defined by equations ( [ msm ] ) and ( [ defmod2 ] ) can be motivated by considering the more general class of idc models . here",
    "we briefly mention the main ideas and results in this theory , and we refer to @xcite for details . at",
    "the base of this construction is an object called an independently scattered infinitely divisible random measure @xmath74 defined on the halfplane @xmath75 .",
    "the defining properties of the random measure @xmath76 are : ( 1 ) for any measurable set @xmath77 , the random variable @xmath78 is infinitely divisible with characteristic function @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "( 2 ) for any finite sequence @xmath81 of disjoint and measurable sets , the corresponding random variables @xmath82 are independent .",
    "if we assume that @xmath83 , the random measure @xmath76 induces a family of centered and stationary stochastic processes through the equation @xmath84 where @xmath85 are cone - like domains defined by @xmath86 with @xmath87 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "the time correlations in the processes @xmath91 are characterized by the functions @xmath92 in fact , the co - variance of @xmath91 is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",

    "consequently the limit process @xmath104 has scaling function @xmath105 in the case that @xmath91 are gaussian , i.e. @xmath106 , the co - variance is on the form @xmath107 for @xmath108 , and hence it can be approximated by the process defined by equation ( [ defmod2 ] ) . in this case",
    "the scaling function is @xmath109 we note that for @xmath110 the process @xmath1 is reduced to a brownian motion and @xmath111 .",
    "we point out that this paper presents a ml estimator for the discrete - time process @xmath10 defined by equations ( [ msm ] ) and ( [ defmod2 ] ) .",
    "this is sufficient for the purpose of modeling and forecasting volatility in financial time series , since the discrete - time mrw model is directly comparable to garch - type models . in other applications , such as modeling the velocity field in turbulence , one is interested in the continuous - time process @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath10 is an approximation to the continuous - time process @xmath1 , our method can also be interpreted as an estimator for this process . in this case",
    "one must be aware that the increment process @xmath112 is not proportional ( in law ) to @xmath113 , and that this is only an approximation in the limit @xmath114 .",
    "see appendix a.1 . in @xcite . in the case of strong intermittency , the estimator for the continuous - time process @xmath1 may therefore depend significantly on the time - scale @xmath115 for which the data is sampled .",
    "an analysis of how our method performs as an estimator for @xmath1 will require extensive monte carlo simulations ( with varying @xmath36 and @xmath115 ) , and this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we also remark that it in some applications is relevant to estimate the parameters of the measure @xmath116 , for instance when modeling the energy dissipation fields in turbulence . in the discrete - time approximation",
    "this corresponds to the process @xmath117 , where @xmath21 is described by equation ( [ defmod2 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath21 is gaussian , this problem is much easier than the one considered in this paper .",
    "the ml estimator for @xmath117 can be constructed using standard methods @xcite and no approximations are required .",

    "first we decompose the density into one - dimensional marginals ; @xmath126 where we have used the notation @xmath127 denote by @xmath128 the co - variance matrix of the vector @xmath129 , and let @xmath130 .",
    "the co - variance matrix can be written on the block form : @xmath131 by performing standard computations of conditional marginals in multivariable gaussian distributions we deduce that @xmath132 is a gaussian with mean @xmath133 and variance @xmath134 as usual it is convenient to introduce vectors @xmath135 defined by @xmath136 .",
    "this allows us to write the mean as @xmath137 and the variance as @xmath138 . then from equation ( [ marginals ] ) we have @xmath139 combining equation ( [ factor2 ] ) with equation ( [ factor1 ] ) we get an expression for the full likelihood : @xmath140 we keep in mind that @xmath26 depends on @xmath141 and @xmath36 through the relation @xmath142=r^{\\lambda^2/2}$ ] . +",

    "the estimators of @xmath186 behave reasonably well , even though there are significant mean square errors and some bias .",
    "we see that both the ml and gmm method underestimate @xmath186 and that the errors are roughly the same for the two estimators .    on the other hand we observe that the ml estimates of @xmath36 have a standard deviations which are much smaller than the corresponding standard deviation for the gmm estimate , especially for @xmath176 .",

    "we have plotted the mean square errors ( mse ) @xmath199 $ ] for the ml estimator with @xmath176 and the gmm estimator .",
    "we see that for both the estimators the mse is roughly invserly proportional to the sample length .",
    "however , from table [ tab2 ] we see that is a slight negative bias in @xmath200 for the ml estimator .",
    "this bias decreases with increasing @xmath154 , and we suspect the estimator to be asymptotically unbiased in the limit @xmath201 .",
    "in this paper we have presented an approximate ml estimator for mrw processes . the method is implemented and tested in a monte carlo study , and",
