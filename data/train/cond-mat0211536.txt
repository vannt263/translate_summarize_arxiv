    "<S> parametric charge pump is a device that drives the flow of a dc electric current by a time dependent variation of _ two _ or more device parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum parametric pump has received considerable attention both experimentally and theoretically@xcite . a very useful and clear transport theory on quantum parametric pump was provided by brouwer@xcite for the adiabatic regime , _ </S>",

    "<S> formula@xcite for adiabatic pumping .    in the following </S>",
    "<S> we calculate pumped current using eq.([final ] ) for a symmetric double @xmath70-barrier structure given by @xmath71 . for this system the green s function @xmath72 </S>",
    "<S> can be calculated exactly@xcite . in the adiabatic theory , </S>",
    "<S> two pumping potentials are needed in order to give a nonzero pumping current . at finite frequency , </S>",
    "<S> a _ </S>",
    "<S> single _ pumping potential was reported to be enough to pump a current@xcite which is peculiar , and our exact non - perturbative theory derived above allows us to investigate this situation clearly and unambiguously . </S>",
    "<S> we chose the single pumping potential to be sinusoidal @xmath73 , and we calculate pumped current from the left lead at zero temperature and set @xmath74 unless specified otherwise . a gate voltage @xmath75 is applied to the double barrier structure so that the resonant single particle energy level is controlled by it . </S>",
    "<S> we fix the fermi level of leads in line with the resonant level at @xmath76 . finally the unit is set by @xmath77 . for gaas material with well width @xmath78 </S>",
    "<S> , the energy unit is @xmath79 which corresponds to @xmath80 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> the unit for pumped current is @xmath81 a.    fig.1 shows the pumped current versus the gate voltage in the strong pumping regime for @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> following observations are in order . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) the pumped current displays a series of remarkable plateaus . </S>",
    "<S> the width of a plateau is equal to @xmath85 whereas the height of the plateau depends on @xmath86 and @xmath87 in a nonlinear fashion . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) the pumped current reverses its direction when the resonant level across the fermi level of the lead , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , when @xmath75 changes sign . as a result , we see from fig.1 that the pumped current is quenched near @xmath76 . ( 3 ) </S>",
    "<S> the height of the current plateaus for negative @xmath75 is considerablely larger than those of positive @xmath75 . to understand these results , </S>",
    "<S> we rewrite eq.([final ] ) as @xmath88 with @xmath89 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we notice that kernel @xmath90 consists of two terms : one due to photon absorption process@xcite and the other to photon emission process . </S>",
    "<S> these two contributions differ by a sign indicating the competition between the photon absorption and emission processes similar to that discussed in ref .. in fig.2 we plot the integrand of eq.([final1 ] ) , @xmath91 , for @xmath92 ( solid line , dotted line , dashed line , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sidebands due to photon absorption ( when @xmath93 ) and photon emission are clearly seen ( for an n - photon emission process , the energy has been shifted by @xmath94 due to the transformation from eq.([final ] ) to eq.([final1 ] ) ) . to obtain pumped current , one integrates these sidebands over energy . for the n - th sideband ( @xmath95 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the integral range is @xmath96 $ ] : it is therefore clear that the plateau structure is a direct result of multi - photon assisted processes . </S>",
    "<S> the positive current is due to photon absorption processes and the current reverses its sign if photon emission process dominates . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of current reversal has been observed before for pumping in carbon nanotubes@xcite , charge quantization@xcite , and heat current generated during the pumping@xcite , although from completely different origins . due to the energy dependence of coupling between the pump and the leads , the sideband is asymmetric with a larger peak for photon absorption process . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the height of the current plateau is larger for photon absorption process . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical plots show that this plateau structure persists for different frequencies and pumping amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis show that there are two effects which affect the current plateau structure . </S>",
    "<S> the first is barrier heights of the quantum well : current plateaus can only be observed in the strong tunneling regime and they disappear for low barrier height . </S>",
    "<S> the second is temperature : the plateau structure is rounded off at finite temperature and destroyed when temperature reaches @xmath97 for @xmath98ghz .    </S>",
    "<S> when the pumping potential is inside of the double - barrier structure , we found a similar plateau structure due to the same photon assisted processes . </S>",
    "<S> in fig.3 , the pumped current as a function of pumping position @xmath99 is plotted at a fixed @xmath100 for a much smaller pumping amplitude @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the pumped current @xmath102 is _ antisymmetric _ about the center of the pump . as expected for a symmetric structure </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath102 vanishes identically at @xmath103 . at @xmath104 </S>",
    "<S> , we found @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.3 shows that @xmath102 can increase by three orders of magnitude by varying the position of the pumping potential away from the barriers .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have derived a non - perturbative and exact current expression for parametric pumping at finite frequency and finite pumping amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> this theory can also account for the case of pumping potential located in the _ interior _ of the scattering region . </S>",
    "<S> our theory reproduces all previously known results in both adiabatic regime and in perturbative theory . for a double - barrier quantum well pump </S>",
    "<S> , we predicted current plateaus to appear due to multi - photon assisted processes with the plateau width given by the pumping frequency . </S>",
    "<S> as the gate voltage is varied and the resonance level sweeps through the fermi energy of leads , the pumped current is found to reverse its direction . </S>"
