    "it has been realized for sometime that supersymmetric ( susy ) models allow for an array of cp violating phases not found in the standard model(sm ) , and that these phases will in general give rise to electric dipole moments ( edms ) of the electron and the neutron which might violate the experimental bounds @xcite .",
    "the current 90 @xmath10 c.l .",
    "bounds for @xmath1 and 95 @xmath10 c.l .",
    "bounds for @xmath0 are quite stringent @xcite : @xmath11 while these bounds can always be satisfied by assuming sufficiently small phases ( i.e o(10@xmath12 ) ) and/or a heavy susy mass spectrum ( i.e.@xmath131 tev ) , recently it has been pointed out that cancellations may occur allowing for  naturally \" large phases ( i.e. o(10@xmath14 ) ) and a light mass spectrum @xcite and this has led to considerable analysis both within the mssm framework @xcite and the gravity mediated supergravity ( sugra ) gut framework @xcite . in the latter type models the theory is specified by assigning the susy parameters at the gut scale , and using the renormalization group equations ( rges ) , one determines the physical predictions at the electroweak scale ( @xmath15 ) ( which we take here to be the t - quark mass , @xmath16 ) . thus in sugra models ,  naturalness \" is to be determined in terms of the gut parameters .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we examined the minimal model , msugra , which depends on the four universal soft breaking parameters at @xmath17 [ @xmath18(scalar mass ) , @xmath19 ( gaugino mass ) , @xmath20 ( cubic term mass ) and @xmath21 ( quadratic term mass ) ] and the higgs mixing parameter @xmath22 .",
    "since @xmath18 is real and we can choose phases such that @xmath19 is real , one has only three phases at the gut scale in msugra : @xmath23 in ref.@xcite , it was shown that for the t - quark cubic soft breaking parameter at @xmath15 , @xmath24 , the nearness of the t - quark landau pole automatically suppresses @xmath25 ( the phase of @xmath26 at @xmath15 ) , and one can satisfy the edm bounds with a light susy spectrum for large @xmath27 , even @xmath28 . however , the situation is more difficult for @xmath3",
    ". the experimental requirements of eq.([dnde ] ) combined with radiative breaking of @xmath29 at @xmath15 imply that @xmath3 is large i.e. o(1 ) ( unless @xmath27 is small and then all phases are small ) and more serious , must be tightly fine tuned unless tan@xmath30 is small ( tan@xmath83 ) . for example , fixing @xmath31 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 to be light and @xmath27 large , one characteristically would find that @xmath3 needs to be specified to 1 part in 10@xmath32 for tan@xmath30=10 . without this fine tuning ,",
    "the gut theory would not achieve electroweak symmetry breaking at @xmath15 and/or satisfaction of eq.([dnde ] ) .",
    "nonminimal models were also examined in @xcite with results similar to the above holding . in this paper",
    "we examine the nonminimal models in more detail .",
    "we then discuss an interesting d - brane model @xcite , where the standard model gauge group is associated with two 5-branes .",
    "this model results in nonuniversal gaugino and scalar masses and is able to allow larger values of @xmath7 at @xmath15 .",
    "however , the same fine tuning problem at @xmath17 for @xmath3 results in this model as well .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : sec.2 reviews the basic formulae and notation of the sugra gut models for calculating the edms .",
    "sec.3 examines a general class of non universalities .",
    "sec.4 . considers the model of @xcite and conclusions are given in sec 5 .",
    "we consider here supersymmetry gut models possessing r - parity invariance where susy is broken in a hidden sector at a scale above @xmath33 gev .",
    "this breaking is then transmitted by gravity to the physical sector .",
    "the gut group is assumed to be broken to the standard model ( sm ) @xmath34 at @xmath17 , but is otherwise unspecified .",
    "the gauge kinetic function , @xmath35 , and kahler potential , k , can then give rise to nonuniversal gaugino masses at @xmath17 which we parametrize by @xmath36 and we chose the phase convention where @xmath37 .",
    "we also allow nonuniversal higgs and third generation masses at @xmath17 which can arise from the kahler potential : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , etc .",
    ", @xmath18 is the universal mass of the first two generations and @xmath42 are the deviations from this for the higgs bosons and the third generation .",
    "in addition , there may be nonuniversal cubic soft breaking parameters at @xmath17 : @xmath43    the electric dipole moment @xmath44 for fermion f is defined by the effective lagrangian : @xmath45 our analysis follows that of @xcite .",
    "thus the basic diagrams leading to the edms are given in fig.1 .",
    "in addition there are gluonic operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 contributing to @xmath1 arising from the one loop diagram of fig.1 ( when the outgoing vector boson is a gluon ) , the two loop weinberg type diagram@xcite and two loop barr - zee type diagram@xcite .",

    "the quark dipole moments are related to @xmath1 using the nonrelativistic quark model to relate the u and d quark moments to @xmath1 i.e. @xmath56 and we assume the s - quark mass is 150 mev .",
    "thus qcd effects produce considerable uncertainty in @xmath1 ( perhaps a factor of 2 - 3 ) .",
    "our matter phase conventions are chosen so that the chargino(@xmath57 ) , neutralino(@xmath58 ) and squark and slepton mass matrices take the following form : @xmath59    @xmath60    and @xmath61 in the above @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) , @xmath68 for u(d ) quarks .",

    "we include the full third generation states , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 in @xmath76 which allows us to treat the large tan@xmath30 regime . from eq.([sqrk ] ) this implies that @xmath76 depends only on @xmath85 , @xmath86 ( though the rotation matrices which diagonalize @xmath87 , @xmath88 will depend on @xmath71 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 separately ) .",
    "minimizing @xmath91 with respect to @xmath92 . then determines @xmath71 : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the one loop correction .",
    "in general , @xmath94 is small , but can become significant for large tan@xmath30 , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "minimizing @xmath91 with respect to @xmath95 and @xmath96 yields two equations which can be arranged in the usual fashion to determine @xmath97 and @xmath98 at @xmath99 : @xmath100 @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "note that @xmath104 and @xmath98 depend implicitly on the cp violating phases since the rge that determines @xmath105 couple to the @xmath106 and @xmath107 equations , and @xmath108 depend on the phases .",
    "the renormalization group equations that relate @xmath109 to @xmath17 are in general complicated differential equations requiring numerical solution , and all results given here are consequences of accurate numerical integration .",
    "approximate analytic solutions can however be found for low and intermediate tan@xmath30 ( neglecting b and @xmath84 yukawa couplings ) and in the so(10 ) limit of very large tan@xmath30 ( neglecting the @xmath84 yukawa coupling ) .",
    "these analytic solutions give some insight into the nature of the more general numerical solutions .    for low and intermediate tan@xmath30 , the @xmath26 and yukawa rges read @xmath110 where @xmath111 , @xmath112 is the t - quark yukawa coupling constant and @xmath113=(13/15,3,16/3 ) .",
    "we follow the sign conventions of ref.@xcite , and @xmath114 .",
    "the solutions of eqs.(20 ) can be written as @xmath115 where @xmath116    and    @xmath117    here @xmath118 vanishes at the t - quark landau pole and hence is generally small i.e. ( @xmath119 for @xmath120 gev ) .",
    "the functions f and e depend on the sm gauge beta functions and are given in @xcite .",
    "( e=12.3 , f=254 for @xmath121 . )",
    "we note the identity@xcite @xmath122 and so if we write eq.([at ] ) as @xmath123 the @xmath124 are real and @xmath125 .",
    "( in the so(10 ) large tan@xmath30 limit , one obtains an identical result with the factor 6 replaced 7 in @xmath126 .",
    "thus eq.([att ] ) gives a valid qualitative picture over a wide range in tan@xmath30 . )",
    "nonuniversal gaugino masses affect the edms in two ways .",
    "first , taking the imaginary part of eq.([att ] ) one has ( @xmath127=0 in our phase convention ) :    @xmath128    as in the universal case , the smallness of @xmath126 suppresses the effects of any large @xmath129 on the electroweak scale phase @xmath25 .",
    "however large gaugino phases @xmath130 will generally make @xmath25 large .",
    "second , eqs.([neut ] ) and ( [ char ] ) show that the phase @xmath131 enters into the neutralino mass matrix though the chargino mass matrix remains unchanged ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "thus the @xmath131 phase will affect any cancellation occurring between the neutralino and chargino contributions to the edms .",
    "some of the above efffects are illustrated in figs . 2 and 3 , where we plot k vs. the phase @xmath7 at the electroweak scale for @xmath0 . here",
    "k is defined by @xmath133 thus k=0 corresponds to the case where the theory saturates the current experimental edm bound , while k=-1 , would be the situation if the experimental bounds were reduced by a factor of 10 .",
    "fig.2 considers universal scalar masses and universal @xmath20 with @xmath28 at the gut scale , and @xmath134 , -1.3@xmath135 , -1.5@xmath135 for tan@xmath30=3 .",
    "we see that as @xmath136 is increased from @xmath136=1.1@xmath135 to 1.3 @xmath135 , the allowed values of @xmath7 increases significantly since the @xmath131 phase in eq .",
    "( 11 ) aids the cancellation between the neutralino and the chargino contributions .",
    "however , increasing @xmath136 further to @xmath136=1.5@xmath135 over compensates causing the allowed values of @xmath7 to decrease .",
    "3 for tan@xmath30=10 shows a similar effect .",
    "the experimentally allowed parameters require @xmath137 .",
    "the allowed range @xmath138 of @xmath7 decreases with tan@xmath30 .",
    "it is very small for tan@xmath30=10 and is quite small even for tan@xmath30=3 .",
    "recent advances in string theory leading to possible d=4 , n=1 supersymmetric vacua after compactification has restimulated interest in phenomenological string motivated model building .",
    "a number of approaches exists including models based on type iib orientifolds , horava - witten m theory compactification on @xmath139 and perturbative heterotic string vacua .",
    "the existence of open string sectors in type iib strings implies the presence of @xmath140-branes , manifolds of p+1 dimensions in the full d=10 space of which 6 dimensions are compactified e.g. on a six torus @xmath141 .",
    "( for a survey of properties of type iib orientifold models see @xcite ) .",
    "one can build models containing 9 branes ( the full 10 dimensional space ) plus @xmath142-branes , i=1 , 2 , 3 ( each containg two of the compact dimensions ) or 3 branes plus 7@xmath143 branes , i=1 , 2 , 3 ( each having two compactified dimensions orthogonal to the brane ) . associated with a set of n coincident branes is a gauge group u(n ) .",
    "thus there are large number of ways one might embed the standard model gauge group in type iib models .",
    "we consider here an interesting model recently proposed @xcite based on 9-branes and 5-branes . in this model , @xmath5 is associated with one set of 5-branes , i.e. @xmath144 , and su(2)@xmath145 is associated with a second intersecting set 5@xmath146 .",
    "strings starting on 5@xmath146 and ending on 5@xmath147 have massless modes carrying the joint quantum numbers of the two branes ( we assume these are the sm quark and lepton doublets , higgs doublets ) while strings beginning and ending on 5@xmath147 have massless modes carrying @xmath5 quantum numbers ( right quark and right lepton states ) .",
    "a number of general properties of such models have been worked out @xcite .",
    "thus to accommodate the phenomenological requirement of gauge coupling constant unification at @xmath33 gev , one may assume , that @xmath148 , the compactification scale of the kaluza - klein modes obeys @xmath149 .",
    "above @xmath148 , the gauge interactions on the 5-branes see a d=6 dimensional space ( with kaluza klein modes ) while above @xmath148 gravity sees the full d=10 space . gravity and gauge unification then is to take place at the string scale @xmath150 given by @xmath151 gev ( for @xmath152 ) .",
    "the gauge kinetic functions for 9 branes and 5@xmath143-branes are given by @xcite @xmath153 and @xmath154 where s is the dilaton and @xmath155 are moduli .",
    "the origin of the spontaneous breaking of n=1 supersymmetry and of compactification is not yet understood within this framework .",
    "further , cp violation must also occur as a spontaneous breaking .",
    "one assumes these effects can be phenomenologically accounted for by f - components growing vevs parametrized as @xcite @xmath156 where @xmath157 , @xmath158 are goldstino angles ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "cp violation is thus incorporated in the phases @xmath160 , @xmath161 . in the following",
    "we will assume , for simplicity , that @xmath162 ( i.e. that the 5@xmath163-brane does not affect the physical sector ) .",
    "we also assume isotropic compactification ( @xmath164 ) are equal ) to guarantee grand unification at @xmath17 , and @xmath165=0 so that the spontaneous breaking does not grow a @xmath71-qcd type term .    for models of this type ,",
    "t - duality determines the kahler potential @xcite and , combined with eq.(28 ) , generates the soft breaking terms .",
    "one finds at @xmath17@xcite : @xmath166 and @xmath167 here @xmath20 is a universal cubic soft breaking mass , @xmath168 are the soft breaking masses for @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 are for @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "we see that the brane models give rise to nonuniversalities that are strikingly different from what one might expect in sugra gut models",
    ". thus it would be difficult to construct a gut group , which upon spontaneous breaking at @xmath17 yields gaugino masses @xmath176=@xmath177 , and similarly the above pattern of sfermion and higgs soft masses .",
    "brane models can achieve the above pattern since they have the freedom of associating different parts of the sm gauge group with different branes .",
    "the above model does not determine the @xmath178 and @xmath179 parameters .",
    "we therefore will phenomenologically parametrize these at @xmath17 by @xmath180 with two additional cp violating phases @xmath3 and @xmath181 .",
    "we also set @xmath182 in the following .",
    "we consider first the electron edm .",
    "( we use the interactions of ref.@xcite including the erratum on the sign of eq.(5.5 ) of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "fig.4 plots k as a function of @xmath7 for tan@xmath30=2 ( solid ) , 5 ( dashed ) , 10 ( dotted ) with phases @xmath183 and @xmath184 gev , @xmath185 , @xmath186=0.85 .",
    "we see that the edm bounds allow remarkably large values of @xmath7 in this model even for large tan@xmath30 , e.g. @xmath187 for tan@xmath30=2 and @xmath188 for tan@xmath30=10 .",
    "( a second allowed region occurring approximately for @xmath189 also exists .",
    "however this corresponds to the sign of @xmath179 that is mostly excluded by the @xmath190 data . )",
    "fig.5 shows a similar plot for somewhat smaller phases @xmath191 .",
    "again relatively large phases can exist at the electroweak scale .    as discussed in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the largeness of @xmath7 is due to an enhanced cancellation between the neutralino and chargino contributions as a consequence of the additional @xmath131 dependence in eq.(11 ) , allowing @xmath7 to be o(1 ) .",
    "however , in spite of this , the range in @xmath7 at the electroweak scale , where the experimental bound @xmath137 is satisfied , is quite small , e.g. from fig.4 , @xmath1920.015 even for tan@xmath30=2 .",
    "as discussed in ref@xcite , this implies that the radiative breaking condition makes the allowed range @xmath193 at the gut scale very small , particularly for large tan@xmath30 .",
    "this is illustrated in figs .",
    "6 and 7 . in fig.6",
    ", we have plotted the central value of @xmath3 which satisfies @xmath194 as a function of tan@xmath30 .",
    "thus @xmath3 is generally quite large . in fig.7",
    "we have plotted the allowed range of @xmath193 satisfying the edm constraints .",
    "one sees that even for small tan@xmath30 the allowed range @xmath193 is very small .",
    "thus as in the msugra model of ref.@xcite , one has a serious fine tuning problem at the gut scale due to the combined conditions of radiative breaking and the edm bound : @xmath3 must be large but very accurately determined by the string model if it is to agree with low energy phenomenology .",
    "the neutron dipole moment is more complicated due to the additional contributions arising from @xmath195 and @xmath196 of eqs.(8 ) and ( 7 ) .",
    "while there are significant uncertainties in the calculation of @xmath1 it is of interest to see if the experimental bounds on @xmath1 can be achieved in the same region of parameter space as occur in @xmath0 above .",
    "the fact that the brane model requires @xmath197 allows for the @xmath195 gluino contribution to aid in canceling the chargino contribution .",
    "this generally aids in broadening the overlap region of joint satisfaction of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 bounds of eq.([dnde ] ) .",
    "however , in addition to this , there is a contribution from @xmath196 from the weinberg type diagram .",
    "while this term is enhanced due to the factor of @xmath16 , it is a two loop diagram and is suppressed by a factor of @xmath198(@xmath199 ) and in most models is usually a small contribution .",
    "however , for the d - brane model where @xmath197 , the presence of a large @xmath200 phase increases the significance of this diagram , reducing the @xmath201 overlap region .",
    "this is illustrated in figs.8 where @xmath186 is plotted as a function of @xmath7 for parameters tan@xmath30=2 , @xmath184 gev , @xmath157=0.2 .",
    "( lep189 bounds of @xmath202 gev imply here that @xmath203 . ) as one proceeds from @xmath204 of fig.8a to @xmath205 of fig.8d , one goes from no overlap of the allowed @xmath0 and @xmath1 regions to a significant overlap .",
    "however , the large @xmath7 phase allowed separately by @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( e.g. @xmath206 ) in fig.8a is sharply reduced in fig.8d in the overlap region by a factor of 10 .",
    "further , the region of parameter space where the experimental constraints for @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be simultaneously satisfied generally decreases with increasing tan@xmath30 .",
    "fig.9 gives the allowed region for the parameters of fig .",
    "8b with @xmath207 , for tan@xmath30=2 , 3 and 5 .",
    "the allowed parameter space disappears for tan@xmath208 .",
    "if , however , the overlap in allowed parameter region between @xmath0 and @xmath1 occurs for smaller @xmath131",
    "i.e. @xmath209 , one can have larger values of tan@xmath30 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.10 for @xmath210 ( i.e. 2@xmath211=0.03@xmath135 ) for tan@xmath30=10 .",
    "the region of overlap however now requires @xmath7 to be quite small i.e. @xmath212 .",
    "of course the fine tuning of @xmath3 at the gut scale becomes quite extreme for larger tan@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "while the quark mass ratios are well determined , the values of @xmath213 and @xmath214 remain very uncertain due to the uncertainty in @xmath215 @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in ref.@xcite , this uncertainty contributes significantly to the uncertainty in the calculation of @xmath1 .",
    "this effect for the model of ref.@xcite is illustrated in fig.11 for @xmath216 , tan@xmath30=2 .",
    "11a corresponds to the choice of light quarks ( @xmath217 95 mev ) while fig .",
    "11b to heavy quarks ( @xmath217 225 mev ) . for light quarks ,",
    "the weinberg three gluon term makes a relatively larger contribution and aids more in the cancellation needed to satisfy the edm constraint . in general , though , the weinberg term can be several times the upper bound on @xmath1 of eq.(1 ) , and so makes a significant contribution .",
    "in other figures of this paper , we have used a central value of @xmath215 i.e @xmath218 mev corresponding to @xmath219 mev and @xmath220 mev .",
    "in minimal sugra models with universal soft breaking , it has previously been seen that the current edm constraints can be satisfied without fine tuning the cp violating phases at the electroweak scale . for this case",
    "the edms are most sensitive to @xmath7 , the phase of the b parameter , and experiment can be satisfied with @xmath7=o(10@xmath14 ) .",
    "it was seen however that at the gut scale , @xmath3 was generally large ( unless masses were large or the other phases were small ) , and in order to satisfy both the edm constraints and radiative electroweak breaking , @xmath3 had to be fine tuned , the fine tuning becoming more serious as tan@xmath30 increased@xcite . in this paper",
    "we have examined nonuniversal models , and have found generally that the same phenomenon exists .",
    "we have studied in some detail an interesting d - brane model involving cp violating phases where the standard model gauge group is embedded on two sets of 5-branes , @xmath5 on @xmath144 and @xmath6 on @xmath221 so that the gaugino phases obey @xmath222@xcite .",
    "this is a symmetry breaking pattern that is different from what one normally expects in gut models .",
    "if one examines @xmath0 and @xmath1 separately , one finds that this model can accommodate remarkably large values of @xmath7 i.e. @xmath7 as large as 0.7 .",
    "however , the same fine tuning problem arises at the gut scale for @xmath3 .",
    "further , the region in parameter space where the experimental bounds on both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are satisfied shrinks considerably .",
    "thus the model can not actually realize the very largest @xmath7 ( though @xmath7 as large as @xmath223 is still possible ) .",
    "the weinberg three gluon diagram typically is several times the current experimental upper bound on @xmath1 , and so makes a significant contribution , particularly if the quark masses are light .",
    "( the barr - zee term is generally small if the susy parameters are @xmath224 tev . )",

    "<S> large values of @xmath7 ( the phase of b at the electroweak scale ) can be accommodated , though again @xmath3 must be fine tuned . using the conventional prescription for calculating @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> one finds the region in parameter space where the experimental edm constraints on both @xmath0 and @xmath1 hold is significantly reduced , and generally requires tan@xmath85 for most of the parameter space , though there are small allowed regions even for tan@xmath910 . </S>",
    "<S> we find the weinberg three gluon term generally makes significant contributions , and results are sensitive to the values of quark masses .    </S>",
