    "the phenomenon of beats arises due to the superposition of two periodic excitations of slightly different frequencies .",
    "this superposition results in a cyclic behaviour arising due to the constructive and destructive interferences between these two excitations .",
    "the resultant waveform is characterized by a frequency that equals the average of the frequencies of the two waves , whereas its amplitude is modulated by an envelope , whose frequency known as the _ beat frequency _ is the difference between the frequencies of the two waves .",
    "this phenomenon has been widely studied in linear systems .",
    "however recently , attention has been drawn to chaotic and hyper - chaotic beats in nonlinear systems .",
    "chaotic or hyper - chaotic beats arise due to the irregular collapses and revivals in amplitudes of the variables of nonlinear systems as a result of the interaction between two different excitations ( either self oscillations or external driving forces ) in these systems . though they can be identified by visual inspection , the presence of positive lyapunov exponent(s )",
    "is considered as the true characterizing feature of chaotic or hyper - chaotic beats .",
    "chaotic and hyper - chaotic beats were identified for the first time in a system of coupled kerr oscillators and coupled duffing oscillators with small nonlinearities and strong external pumping [ grygiel @xmath0 szlachetka , 2002 ] .",
    "chaotic beats were also reported in coupled non - autonomous chua s circuits [ cafagna @xmath0 grassi , 2004 ] .",
    "weakly chaotic and hyper - chaotic beats were reported in individual and coupled nonlinear optical subsystems , respectively , describing second harmonic generation ( shg ) of light [ liwa _ et al_. , 2008 ] .",
    "in all these coupled systems [ grygiel @xmath0 szlachetka , 2002 ; cafagna @xmath0 grassi , 2004 ; liwa _ et al_. , 2008 ] , the occurrence of beats is attributed to the interaction between the self oscillations or driven oscillations of each of the coupled subsystems . using extensive pspice simulations ,",
    "the occurrence of beats in individual driven chua s circuit with two external excitations has also been reported [ cafagna @xmath0 grassi , 2006a ; 2006b ] .",
    "chaotic beats have also been found to occur in individual murali- lakshmanan - chua ( mlc ) circuit by the same authors [ cafagna @xmath0 grassi , 2005 ] . in these cases of single systems",
    "[ cafagna @xmath0 grassi , 2005 ; 2006a ; 2006b ] , two different external driving forces with slightly differing frequencies were the cause for the occurrence of beats .",
    "on the other hand , from a different perspective , leon chua in the year 1971 introduced a fourth circuit element , namely the memristor [ chua , 1971 ; chua @xmath0 kang , 1976 ] , purely from theoretical arguments , and pointed out the interesting possibilities of including it in electronic circuits .",
    "almost four decades later , strutkov et al . of hewlett - packard laboratories",
    "designed the first approximate physical example of a memristor [ strutkov , 2008 ] in a solid - state nano - scale system in which electronic and ionic transports are coupled under an external bias voltage .",
    "as the @xmath1 characteristic of memristors is inherently non - linear and is unique in the sense that no combination of nonlinear resistive , capacitive and inductive components can duplicate their circuit properties , memristors have generated considerable excitement among circuit theorists .",
    "further they provide new circuit functions such as electronic resistance switching at extremely high two - terminal device densities [ strutkov , 2008 ] . very recently",
    "itoh and chua [ 2009 ] , have investigated the dynamics of nonlinear electronic circuits of different orders , including autonomous chua s oscillator and canonical chua s oscillator by replacing a chua s diode - a well studied and familiar nonlinear device - by an _",
    "active _ or a _ passive _ memristor .",
    "hence it will be of high current interest to study the effect of replacing the chua s diode by a memristor in a driven chua s circuit [ murali @xmath0 lakshmanan , 1990 ; 1991 ] , and investigate the new dynamical phenomena which arise from the corresponding circuit .    in the present paper , we report the occurrence of chaotic beats in the driven chua s circuit using a flux controlled active memristor as its nonlinearity .",
    "the importance of this circuit is that it employs just a single driving force and makes use of the chaotically time varying resistive property and the switching characteristic of the memristor to generate beats .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 memristors , their characteristic and their behaviours are briefly described . in sec .",
    "3.1 the standard driven chua s circuit is introduced while in sec .",
    "3.2 the driven chua s circuit using a memristor as the nonlinear element is described . in sec .",
    "4 the chaotic beats phenomenon observed numerically in this circuit is shown with the aid of time series plots , phase portraits and poincar maps , lyapunov exponents and power spectral calculations . in sec .",
    "5 an experimentally realisable circuit for the memristor is proposed .",
    "using multisim modelling , a driven chua s circuit is constructed and the chaotic beats observed . with the help of the grapher facility of the software package , time series plots , phase portrait , power spectra which are qualitatively equivalent to the numerical observations are presented . in sec .",
    "6 the mechanism for the occurrence of chaotic beats is discussed , while sec . 7",
    "presents a brief conclusion .",
    "from a circuit theoretic point of view , leon chua [ 1971 ] noted that there could possibly be six mathematical relations connecting pairs of the four fundamental variables , namely charge @xmath2 , current @xmath3 , flux @xmath4 and voltage @xmath5 .",
    "one of these relations ( the charge is time integral of current ) is determined from the definitions of the two variables .",
    "another relation ( the flux is the time integral of the electromotive force or voltage ) is given by faraday s law of induction .",
    "three other relations can be constructed from the axiomatic definitions of the three classical two terminal circuit elements , namely , the resistor ( defined by the relationship between @xmath5 and @xmath3 ) , the inductor ( defined by the relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath3 ) and the capacitor ( defined by the relationship between @xmath2 and@xmath5 ) .",
    "one more relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath2 remains undefined . from logical and axiomatic points of view , as well as for the sake of completeness",
    ", the necessity for the existence of a fourth basic two terminal circuit element was postulated by chua [ 1971 ] .",
    "this _ missing element _ purported to have a functional relationship connecting charge @xmath2 and flux @xmath6 is named as @xmath7 .",
    "this hypothetical element is endowed with both a resistive property and a memory like nature and hence it is named so . in principle , memristors with almost any @xmath8 characteristic can be synthesised [ chua , 1971 ] .",
    "although realized , albeit only recently , and that too in the nano - scale range , memristors have been successfully used as a conceptual tool for analysis in signal processing and nonlinear circuits , see for example [ tour @xmath0 he , 2008 ] .",
    "in particular their nonlinear characteristic provides designers with new circuit functions like electronic resistance switching at extremely high two terminal densities [ strutkov _ et al_. , 2008 ] .",
    "we will now study the dynamics of the driven memristive chua s circuit to bring out the concept of chaotic beats in it . for this purpose",
    "we shall first introduce the standard driven chua s circuit .",
    "the driven chua s circuit is a fourth order non - autonomous circuit first introduced by murali and lakshmanan in the year 1990 [ murali @xmath0 lakshmanan , 1990 ] .",
    "it is found to exhibit a large variety of bifurcations such as period adding , quasi - periodicity , intermittency , equal periodic bifurcations , re - emergence of double hook and double scroll attractors , hysteresis and coexistence of multiple attractors , besides the standard bifurcations .",
    "its dynamics in the environment of a sinusoidal excitation has been extensively studied in a series of works [ murali @xmath0 lakshmanan , 1990 ; 1991 ; 1992a ; 1992b ; 1993 ] . due to its simplicity and the rich content of nonlinear dynamical phenomena",
    ", the driven chua s circuit continues to evoke renewed interest by researchers in the field of non - linear electronics [ anishchenko _ et al_. , 1993 ; zhu @xmath0 liu 1997 ; elwakil 2002 ; srinivasan _ et al_. , 2009 ] .         as a function of the flux @xmath9 across the memristor and ( b ) the corresponding characteristic curve of the memristor in the @xmath10 plane . ]",
    "a large number of autonomous nonlinear electronic circuits using memristors as active nonlinear elements have been studied very recently by itoh and leon chua [ itoh @xmath0 chua , 2008 ] and the conditions for the occurrence of chaos in them were mathematically analysed and numerically simulated .",

    "was designed and its chaotic behaviour studied using matlab simulations , and also real time experiments . in this paper , we modify the driven chua s circuit [ murali @xmath0 lakshmanan , 1990 ] mentioned above by removing an inductance and replacing the chua s diode with a three segment _ piecewise - linear _ flux controlled active memristor [ itoh @xmath0 chua , 2008 ] as its nonlinearity . the circuit is given in fig . 1 .",
    "an active flux controlled memristor has the charge through it as some function of the flux across it .",
    "the functional relationship between the flux @xmath6 and charge @xmath2 is assumed to be the same expression as given in [ itoh @xmath0 chua , 2008 ] , namely    @xmath11,\\ ] ]    where a and b are the slopes in the inner and outer segments of the characteristic curve and @xmath12 is a negative conductance which is connected in parallel to the flux controlled memristor to make it satisfy the condition for activity .",
    "the memristor employed here is an active device in the sense that it does not draw power from the circuit of which it is a part of , but in fact it supplies power to it .",
    "it satisfies the criterion for activity [ chua , 1971 ] , namely @xmath13 where @xmath14is the instantaneous power dissipated across the memristor and @xmath15is the memductance of the memristor .",
    "the latter is so called because it has the units of conductance @xmath16 .",
    "it is given by    @xmath17    where @xmath18 are as defined earlier .",
    "the memductance of the memristor takes on two particular values as shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) , depending on the value of the flux across it .",
    "the higher memductance value @xmath19 can be referred as the on state and the lesser memductance value @xmath20 can be referred as the off state . obviously , as the flux across the memristor changes , the memristor switches or toggles between these two states .",
    "this switching action can be made use of profitably in utilising the memristor as a desirable element in modelling of nonlinear circuits .",
    "the characteristic curve in the @xmath8 plane which causes this memristive switching is shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) .    following itoh @xmath0 chua [ 2008 ] , the circuit equations for the memristive driven chua s circuit given by fig . 1",
    ", are written as    @xmath21    normalizing equations ( 4 ) using the same rescaling parameters as those used in [ itoh @xmath0 chua , 2008 ] , namely @xmath22 we have @xmath23 here dot stands for differentiation with respect to t.    the piecewise linear function describing the memristor then becomes @xmath24 where @xmath25 are now the normalized values of the quantities mentioned earlier .",
    "the above circuit , represented by the normalized equations ( 6 ) , though simple in nature , generates beats due to the slight tuning / detuning of frequencies of the external driving excitation and the switching of the memristor between the on and off memristive states .",
    "if we set @xmath26 and change the force @xmath27 and frequency @xmath28 of the external signal suitably in equations ( 6 ) , chaotic beats are found to occur in this circuit .",
    "for example for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , chaotic beats are observed .",

    "the chua s circuit , by virtue of being a nonlinear oscillatory circuit , generates chaotic self oscillations at a frequency determined by the dynamics of the circuit , even in the absence of a driving force .",
    "hence the power spectrum of the memristor switching , seen in fig .",

    "for a forcing amplitude @xmath48 and forcing frequency @xmath49 , chaotic beats are observed with lyapunov exponents @xmath50 .",
    "it is to be noted that the lyapunov values obtained in this case are much less than that obtained for an autonomous chua s circuit using a memristor [ itoh @xmath0 chua , 2008 ] , or for a highly frequency detuned driven memristor chua s circuit wherein beats phenomenon does not arise at all due to the large frequency mismatch .",
    "this lowering of lyapunov exponents denotes a drop in chaoticity of the circuit .",
    "this is because of the control of chaos effected by the introduction of the external driving force on the autonomous chua s circuit .",
    "these values , though small , agree well with the lyapunov exponents obtained in earlier works on chua s circuits employing ordinary chua s diode , namely the two coupled autonomous chua s circuit [ cafagna @xmath0 grassi , 2004 ] as well as the driven chua s circuit [ cafagna @xmath0 grassi , 2006a ; 2006b ] wherein chaotic modulation were observed .",

    "it is pertinent to note here that the present circuit is a single four dimensional non - autonomous circuit ( a dimension of two less than the six dimensional non - autonomous coupled chua s circuit ) and generates chaotic beats using a single periodic driving force ( unlike two driving forces employed in earlier works ) .",

    "]    let us consider a linear sinusoidal excitation of frequency @xmath112 is applied to the memristor . if the flux across the memristor arising due to this sinusoidal excitation were to exceed the two switching thresholds , @xmath113 flux units , then for each external driving cycle , the memristor completes two full switching cycles .",
    "the memristor operation will then be subharmonic with a frequency equal to twice the external driving frequency , that is @xmath114 .",
    "however , in the present case the flux across the memristor is the time integral of the voltage across it , that is , @xmath115 .",
    "this cosinusoidal variation of flux causes it to exceed only one of the two memristor switching thresholds , namely + 1 flux unit .",
    "consequently only one memristor switching occurs for each cycle of the sinusoidal forcing .",
    "hence the memristor switching operation is _",
    "synchronous_. if we plot the probability of the switching times of the memristor driven by this linear sinusoidal forcing , we find a single probability peak which corresponds closely to the period of the linear excitation , namely @xmath116 .",
    "this translates to a frequency of @xmath117 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "if the memristor is connected in parallel to the capacitance @xmath85 of the autonomous chua s circuit , the memristor gets driven by the @xmath118 self oscillatory combination of the circuit , with a frequency varying from @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the switching of the memristor , because of the inherent chaotic nature of self oscillations of the autonomous circuit , becomes haphazard proving that the memristor now acts as a chaotically time varying resistor ctvr .",
    "we get a number of closely spaced switching time probability peaks as shown in fig .",
    "the weighted average of these probability peaks gives a switching time @xmath121 which translates to a switching frequency of @xmath122 .",
    "when an external driving force of a frequency , let us say @xmath49 , is added to the circuit , the memristor is driven by the forced oscillations of the circuit .",
    "as the forced oscillations are also chaotic , the memristor switching is also necessarily chaotic .",
    "hence it still acts as a ctvr .",
    "the probability graph of the memristor switching times shown in fig .",
    "15(c ) now shows a prominent peak at a switching time @xmath123 which corresponds to a memristor switching frequency of @xmath124 .",
    "this is the new switching frequency that the memristor takes on as a result of the apparent control of chaos effected in the circuit by the introduction of the external force . at these particular frequencies , @xmath125 and @xmath124 ,",
    "the external excitations and memristive switching aided forced oscillations in the circuit undergo constructive and destructive interferences , resulting in the modulation of amplitudes and frequencies which we call beats .",
    "varying the external frequency @xmath108 away from this chosen value disrupts the interferences causing the modulation phenomenon to wane and eventually disappear .",
    "the average of the external driving frequency and the new memristor frequency gives the central frequency of modulated signal .",
    "if we plot the switching time probabilities for the positive and negative cycle variations of the variable @xmath31 under amplitude modulation , we get a prominent probability peak at a switching time @xmath126 .",
    "this corresponds to the central frequency @xmath127 .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "the beat frequency , calculated as half the difference in the above said two frequencies , is @xmath128 .",
    "the central and beat frequencies obtained from power spectral calculations as well as from probabilistic considerations are shown in table.1 .",
    "both of these agree well qualitatively with the theoretical results .",
    "however the small differences in their numerical values may be explained as due to the chaotic nature of the system as well as the large number of frequencies involved .",
    "the two dimensional residence time plots for the memristor for the on and off memductive states are plotted in fig . 16 . when a linear force is driving the memristor , the switching ( between positive and negative half cycles of the sinusoidal force ) is regular as seen in fig .",
    "in this case there are only two different values for @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "when the oscillatory part of the autonomous chua s circuit drives it , because of the inherent chaotic nature of the circuit , the memristor also switches irregularly .",
    "the scatter plot of residence times @xmath102 and @xmath103 is erratic and random .",
    "this is evident in fig .",
    "when a driving force is added , both the external oscillations and the driven oscillations of the circuit interact with each other . in this interaction a control of chaos in the circuit is effected by the external driving force . as the chaoticity is reduced , the circuit tends to approach a regular behaviour , resulting in the occurrence of beats .",
    "however as the dynamics of the circuit is still chaotic , the plot of the memristor switching times is also still chaotic , but with a lesser degree of chaoticity or irregularity .",
    "this is also the reason for the low values of the lyapunov exponents obtained .",
    "this weak chaotic switching is illustrated in fig .",
    "the scatter plot of the switching times ( between positive and the negative cyclic variations ) of the variable @xmath31 of the system is shown in fig .",
    "in this paper the presence of chaotic beats phenomenon in a driven memristive chua s circuit is reported .",
    "this phenomenon has been observed and verified using numerical simulations in the form of time series plots , phase portraits and poincar maps .",
    "the chaotic nature of the modulation in amplitudes has been characterized with power spectral density calculations and lyapunov exponents . using multisim modelling an analog electronic circuit to realise the action of a three segment flux controlled memristor",
    "is proposed , and the presence of chaotic beats in the driven memristor chua s circuit using this memristor has been verified .",
    "further , based on probabilistic considerations , the mechanism for the occurrence of beats has been found to be the interaction due to the dynamics based chaotic time varying resistive property and chaotic switching of the memristor between different memristive states .",
    "the use of memristor in the driven chua s circuit has enhanced its dynamics considerably .",
    "many features like reverse period doubling route , intermittent route and higher dimensional torus break down route to chaos , hyper chaos , period adding and farey sequences , transient chaos , double hook attractors etc .",
    ", can also be identified in this circuit .",
    "much progress has been made along these lines and the results will be published seperately .",
