    "at all known epochs , the baryonic mass density of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is thought to outweigh the baryons found in denser collapsed objects stars , galaxies , and clusters .",
    "indeed , at high redshifts ( @xmath10 ) the `` forest '' of ly@xmath2 absorption lines seen in spectra of distant quasars reveals a vast network of cool , photoionized hydrogen that is consistent with the expected baryon density at those redshifts @xcite .",
    "more recently , however , the process of structure formation has shock  heated this intergalactic gas to produce the warm  hot igm ( whim ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "at such high temperatures ( @xmath11k ) and low densities ( @xmath12@xmath13 ; @xmath14 ) , the combination of collisional and photo  ionization renders most of the gas too highly ionized to be detected through its ly@xmath2 absorption ( though some broad ly@xmath2 systems likely tracing the low-@xmath15 whim have been reported , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "since very little information about the physical distribution of this absorbing medium is available , it is unknown whether it originates in the galaxy ( e.g. , as part of a hot , low  density corona ) or farther away in the local whim filament or local intra  group medium . while there is some evidence for such a galactic corona ( e.g. * ? ?",

    "* ) , detailed curve  of  growth and ionization balance analyses of the x - ray absorption lines have found that they are also consistent with the temperatures and densities expected in the whim @xcite .    the ubiquitous  high  velocity clouds ( hvcs ) observed by   @xcite present a similar puzzle .",
    "these clouds are typically seen as absorption lines with velocities inconsistent with galactic rotation ( @xmath17 ) and , lacking distance information , it is unclear whether they are part of the extended galactic baryon distribution or local intergalactic medium .",
    "some are almost certainly associated with nearby  hvcs at similar velocities , such as complex c and the magellanic stream , but others appear completely isolated @xcite .",
    "these isolated  hvcs have an average velocity vector that is large in the local standard of rest but minimized by transforming to the local group rest frame @xcite , indicating that they may indeed be extragalactic .",

    "however , these systems appeared quite different from each other ; for example , the inferred velocity dispersion of the  absorption was relatively low toward mrk 421 ( @xmath18 ) and high toward mrk 279 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "mrk 279 also exhibited a far stronger   hvc than mrk 421 , possibly related to the nearby presence of an   hvc ( complex c ) at the same velocity . with only two sightlines analyzed to this level of detail thus far , comparable data in other directions",

    "however , since wavelength scale errors in  hrc ",
    "s / letg are still not well  determined , this should not be considered a firm result .",

    "furthermore , the 1037  line components ( particularly the hvcs ) are heavily blended with nearby galactic interstellar medium lines such as @xmath108 . since",
    "this blending can introduce additional systematic error and even slight  saturation appears to be rare ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we will disregard the 1037  line in this analysis .",
    "the low resolution of the  gratings compared to uv and optical spectrographs presents unique challenges for column density measurements , since essentially all non  quasar absorption lines are far narrower than the 50m  ( @xmath109  at 20 ) letg line  spread function .",
    "the lack of line width information prevents direct measurement of the profile shape , and hence the degree of saturation for any given line can not be directly determined .",
    "if multiple absorption lines from the same ionic species are detected , however , the relative equivalent widths of these lines can instead be used to place limits on the column density ( @xmath110 ) and velocity dispersion ( or doppler parameter , @xmath111 ) of the medium .    in the case of",

    ", we employ the technique used in @xcite for mrk 279 . for a grid of points in the @xmath117 plane",
    ", equivalent widths and apparent line fwhm values were calculated numerically ( using voigt absorption line profiles ) for the  k@xmath2 , k@xmath51 , and k@xmath37 transitions .",
    "these lines were then added to the continuum model in _ sherpa _ , and @xmath118 calculated with the `` goodness '' command , for every value of @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "figure  [ ch4_fig_nbovii ] shows the contours of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath119 confidence calculated in this manner .    as this figure shows , the minimum @xmath118 is found at @xmath120  and @xmath121 , with the @xmath7 confidence region stretching between @xmath122  and @xmath123 .",
    "additionally , another @xmath7 region can be found at @xmath124  with a higher column density ( @xmath125 ) required to produce consistency with the spectrum .",
    "such high  column densities are unlikely to be produced in a cold ( @xmath126k ) , weakly photoionized medium without producing large amounts of narrow  absorption , so a low@xmath111 solution appears unlikely .",

    "column densities for all x - ray lines ( listed in table  [ ch4_tab_lines ] ) are calculated by assuming the @xmath118minimizing @xmath111 value above .",
    "while most of the lines are too weak for this choice to make a significant difference in the @xmath127 determination , it should be kept in mind that the systematic uncertainty in @xmath110 may be larger than the statistical errorbars .",
    "determination of these parameters for the uv  @xmath103 absorption is decidedly more straightforward since the lines are fully resolved by .",
    "since saturation can make absorption lines broader than would be expected just from the doppler parameter of the gas , the measured line width can not be used directly as a surrogate for @xmath111 .",
    "instead , we calculate _ apparent _",
    "fwhm values and equivalent widths over a grid of @xmath128 and @xmath111 , and find the regions within this grid that are consistent with the measured @xmath129 and @xmath114 values .",

    "velocity   components .",
    "contours of constant @xmath129 are roughly vertical while constant @xmath114 are horizontal in the unsaturated regime . in this case both  and  appear to be at most weakly saturated , so the @xmath129 and @xmath114 contours overlap nearly orthogonally , producing tight constraints on both parameters for both components .",

    "the  and  lines are relatively weak and not as affected by saturation as the , so this change is driven primarily by the decrease in @xmath110 at higher velocity dispersion . though the contours derived from @xmath164 and @xmath165 depend on [ c / o ] and [ ne / o ] , if the abundance mixture of this absorber is roughly solar , then the measured column densities indicate that the previously derived doppler parameter range ( @xmath122 ) fit the data better than a high@xmath111 , unsaturated medium .",

    "several previously discovered ly@xmath2 absorption lines and a small cluster of galaxies appear at a similar velocity in this direction @xcite , so such an absorber may be indicative of intragroup medium or an associated large  scale whim filament .",
    "this absorption line is clearly visible in our coadded acis spectrum , but is not visible in the hrc spectrum ( figure  [ ch4_fig_z055spec ] ) .",
    "a fit to the line in acis yields a wavelength of @xmath171  and an equivalent width @xmath172m  ( @xmath173 assuming @xmath174 ) , both consistent with the f02 measurement ( though the best  fit equivalent width from f02 is roughly twice that measured here ) .",
    "note that this line falls near an acis  s chip node boundary , potentially introducing a systematic offset to the line strength , but such an offset is expected to be small compared to the measurement error .",
    "an upper limit for a line at this wavelength ( @xmath175 , to account for possible hrc / letg wavelength scale discrepancies ) in the hrc spectrum was calculated and found to be @xmath176m  ( @xmath8 confidence ) , so the acis measurement is not ruled out by the hrc non  detection . a simultaneous fit to both the acis and",
    "hrc spectra produces almost exactly the same equivalent width and errors as the acis data alone , further demonstrating that the hrc spectrum is insensitive to this line .",
    "if real , this detection would still be fully consistent ( albeit with large errors ) with the predicted number of  absorbers per unit redshift ( f02 , figure 2 ) .    even with the increased signal  to  noise provided by the additional observations ,",
    "no other absorption lines are seen at this redshift , despite  absorption often being present at whim temperatures . from the @xmath8 upper limit of @xmath177 at this redshift and the measured  column density of @xmath173 ( assuming @xmath174 ) , the inferred @xmath8 _ lower _ limit on the absorber temperature is @xmath178 in collisional ionization equilibrium . this is larger than the maximum temperatures inferred for local warm  hot gas ( e.g. , the galactic corona or local group ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , but it falls within the predicted temperature range for the whim .",
    "furthermore , at densities below @xmath179@xmath13 photoionization enhances the column density in the medium , and the corresponding temperature limit relaxes somewhat ( e.g.   @xmath180 for @xmath181@xmath13 ) .",
    "represents the third  data set we have analyzed for which relatively weak ( @xmath182m ) local absorption , uncontaminated by known hot foreground gas ( as in 3c 273 , situated along the line of sight to a likely galactic supernova remnant ; savage et al .  1993 ) can be detected at high confidence .",
    "although the number of such sightlines is small , similarities and differences in the detected absorption are already beginning to emerge .",
    "the  letg spectrum of mrk 421 contains is the highest ",
    "quality grating spectrum of an extragalactic source to date , with roughly three times the counts per resolution element at 21  as the  data analyzed here @xcite .",
    "many of the ionic species seen toward mrk 421 ( particularly , , , and ) were also detected in the  spectrum , allowing direct comparisons to be made .",
    "in particular , the  absorption ( the strongest  detected ion in both cases ) shows strikingly similar properties between the two objects@xmath183 in mrk 421 versus @xmath50 in .",
    "both  absorbers exhibit consistent velocity dispersions as well , with @xmath184  ( @xmath8 limits ) in mrk 421 and @xmath185  in  ( though this latter quantity is the @xmath7 range , and @xmath8 limits could not be determined ) .",
    "one of the most surprising features of the mrk 421  spectrum is the presence of a weak ( 2.0m ) absorption line at 22.02 , the expected wavelength of the  k@xmath2 inner  shell transition .",
    "even though both this transition and the 1032  lines should both trace the  ground state , the column density derived from the observed k@xmath2 line is a factor of @xmath186 higher than that derived from the uv transition .",
    "if this k@xmath2 transition is a better tracer of the true  column density than the uv line , then the   toward mrk 421 almost certainly arises in a low  density , photoionized medium .",
    "although the  @xmath103 absorption strength toward  is comparable to the mrk 421 sightline , unfortunately this   spectrum does not have sufficient signal  to  noise to detect the k@xmath2 line .",
    "thus , for  we can not determine if there is the same discrepancy between the uv and x - ray , or if the inferred  k@xmath2 column density also implies a photoionized medium along this sightline .",
    "if the  k@xmath2 measurement is disregarded , then the mrk 421 spectrum implies slightly lower  but marginally consistent  temperatures in the collisionally ionized regime ( @xmath187 ; @xmath8 limits from the /ratio ) than  ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "the lower density limit from mrk 421 is somewhat more stringent than that derived from the   oxygen ion ratios ( @xmath189 versus @xmath190 ) , though this may again be primarily an issue of spectral quality .",
    "the @xmath191 seyfert galaxy mrk 279 is significantly less luminous than either  or mrk 421 , but it was observed long enough with  hrc  s / letg to produce a reasonably high  quality spectrum in which strong @xmath1  k@xmath2 absorption was detected @xcite .",
    "two features of this absorption were particularly interesting : ( 1 ) the unusually strong  k@xmath2 absorption ( @xmath192m ) , coupled with a tight upper limit on the k@xmath51 line , indicated that the absorption was best described as an unsaturated medium ( with a @xmath8 lower limit of @xmath19on the doppler parameter ) ; and ( 2 ) the  absorption appears slightly redshifted , making its velocity inconsistent with the  hvc s negative velocity at the @xmath193 level .",
    "as previously mentioned , the velocity of the  toward  appears to be inconsistent with the  velocity at the @xmath106 level , assuming the nominal hrc  s / letg wavelength scale uncertainty of 10m . until systematic errors in the wavelength scale",
    "can be better understood , however , this should not be taken as a definitive result . moreover , while the  toward mrk 279 could not be directly associated with either low ",
    "velocity  component since their velocity dispersions were significantly different , such an association can not be ruled out in the  absorption : all of the  doppler parameters fall within the @xmath7 @xmath111 confidence interval found for the  absorption .",
    "temperature and density constraints on the @xmath1 absorption toward mrk 279 and  are consistent with each other , though this is not surprising  since the quality of the mrk 279 spectrum is lower , only an upper limit on temperature and a lower limit on density could be derived .      in principle , the degree of photoionization in an absorbing medium ( and hence an estimate of the gas density ) can be derived from ionic column density ratios (  [ ch4_sec_tdiag ] ) . however , in the case of , the errors are large enough that no upper limit on the gas density can be found , i.e.  it is fully consistent with collisional ionization or a combination of collisional and photo  ionization . depending on the assumptions made ( in particular , which if any of the  components are associated with the   and ) , the minimum density of this medium appears to be @xmath194 . the best ",
    "fit  column density is @xmath195 and  is by far the dominant ionization state in this medium . if the gas has a metallicity of @xmath196 solar ( comparable to that observed in the diffuse intracluster medium ) , then the total hydrogen density is roughly @xmath197 and the thickness of the absorber @xmath198mpc .    thus , under a set of reasonable assumptions , the observed",
    "absorption is consistent with an extended extragalactic medium , but within the large uncertainties it is just as reasonable to associate it with a local hot galactic corona .",
    "although an association between the x - ray absorber and low  velocity  can not be ruled out from these data alone , the properties of the x - ray absorber are quite similar ( again within the errors ) to those studied along the mrk 421 and mrk 279 sightlines .",
    "these latter two x - ray absorbers are definitely not associated with the low ",
    "velocity  absorption arising in the galactic thick disk , so if they indicate the presence of an additional hot galactic component , then the derived properties of the  absorber are not in conflict with the other measurements of this component .      in their study of three hrc",
    "s / letg observations of  ( observation ids 331 , 1013 , and 1704 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter n02 ) also detected  k@xmath2 and k@xmath51 , , and , albeit at lower confidence .",
    "they also analyze  data of the same sightline , but at that time only 39ks were available , or about one  third of the exposure time analyzed here . as it turns out , the addition of new  and  data brings about significant changes in the interpretation of the local absorption , in two important ways .",
    "first , while n02 were able to fit the observed  @xmath103 line with two gaussian components ( one low  velocity narrow line and a broader , blueshifted hvc ) , the new higher  quality spectrum reveals that the `` broad '' component is actually two distinct hvcs , and the `` narrow '' low ",
    "velocity  is best fit with two components .",
    "second , while the  k@xmath51 line was previously not detected strongly enough to place constraints on the doppler parameter of the absorption , here the k@xmath2 and k@xmath51 lines hint at some degree of saturation and so the  column density we employ in our analysis is about 0.5dex higher than that reported by n02 . both of these effects cause a sharp decrease in the @xmath146 ratio , which in turn removes the need for a photoionization contribution",
    "indeed , when we calculate temperature and density constraints assuming @xmath162 ( as n02 had done ; see figure  [ ch4_fig_ntb52 ] , right panel ) we also find that a high  density , collisionally  ionized solution can not be found without modifications to the relative abundances .",
    "this highlights the major improvements in diagnostic power that can be made by accumulating large numbers of counts per resolution element , either through very long exposures or observations of especially bright background sources .",
    "using all available  letg data on , we have analyzed in detail the ionization and kinematic state of the warm  hot @xmath1 absorbing medium .",
    "we find a doppler parameter range of @xmath122(@xmath7 limits ; @xmath8 limits could not be found ) , which is consistent with the absorption seen toward both mrk 421 and mrk 279 ( though the best  fit value best matches the former sightline ) . assuming that the doppler parameter lies in this range , ionic column densities of , , , and  are consistent with collisional ionization at @xmath199 , though a low  density whim with a significant photoionization contribution can not be ruled out",
    "unlike the other two previously analyzed sightlines , the  absorption toward  may be associated with either one of the low ",
    "velocity   @xmath103 components seen in  or a high  velocity   cloud at @xmath200  ( though its velocity may be inconsistent at the @xmath201 level with another  hvc at @xmath202 , and it is only marginally consistent with the column density of the strongest low  velocity  component ) . the similarities and differences between different sightlines suggest that perhaps there is no single solution to the origin of the @xmath1  absorbers .",
    "the relation between hvcs and  also appears to be diverse , so the location of these systems remains an open question .",
    "the intervening  absorber at @xmath3 reported by @xcite is detected in acis and is consistent with their measurement ; although no other lines are detected at the same redshift , this  absorption is consistent with expectations for whim gas .",
    "it is notable that the  data for this line of sight hint at a number of interesting results ( especially the low best  fit doppler parameter in the @xmath1 absorption ) but the data are not quite of sufficient quality to confidently confirm them .",
    "is quite possibly the only other extragalactic source bright enough to obtain a  letg spectrum with @xmath203 counts per resolution element , comparable to the mrk 421 spectrum analyzed by @xcite , in a reasonable amount of time .",
    "such a spectrum would not only allow a direct comparison of the @xmath204 absorption along two lines of sight , but would also provide a path length four times larger than mrk 421 to search for `` missing baryons '' in intervening whim filaments . with two such systems detected in mrk 421 , a correspondingly larger number could be detected in a  spectrum at comparable signal  to  noise . while longer observations of pks  2155 would have the potential for great scientific results , the large soft x - ray variability of this source ( over a factor of ten , as seen in table  1 ) could hamper the feasibility of such observations .",
