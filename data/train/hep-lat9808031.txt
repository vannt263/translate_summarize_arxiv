    "the `` sphaleron rate , '' the spacetime diffusion constant for chern - simons number @xmath0 , is a key quantity in the study of electroweak baryogenesis , setting the efficiency of baryon number violation .",
    "it is also a very appropriate topic at this conference , since it is nothing but the topological susceptibility of the electroweak plasma , only in _",
    "minkowski _ , time ; @xmath2    @xmath3 can be determined reliably by perturbation theory in any regime where @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the higgs condensate . however",
    ", this is precisely the regime where it is so small as to be of no physical consequence .",
    "we really want to know it in the symmetric phase at @xmath6 the phase transition temperature , to determine how many baryons can be produced ; and in the broken phase at and immediately below @xmath6 to determine whether they are subsequently erased or are preserved until the present epoch .",
    "recently there has been significant progress in the symmetric phase rate .",
    "it has been shown analytically @xcite and verified numerically @xcite that `` hard thermal loop '' radiative corrections are important , and the rate is known with reasonable accuracy , though it has recently been demonstrated that there are logarithmic corrections @xcite which are not well under control .",
    "but the real time method can not measure the broken phase rate ; the rate is so low that no events will occur in any reasonable amount of time .",
    "since we can not extend the perturbative calculation beyond 1 loop , we will instead go about a nonperturbative measurement .",
    "we can use the dimensional reduction approximation and we will relentlessly ; we also take the dynamics to be classical , regulated to give a physically reasonable cutoff to the hard thermal loops . for",
    "a much more detailed discussion of the work presented here , see @xcite .",
    "here is the cartoon picture of why baryon number violation is slow in the broken phase . because the higgs condensate makes being half way between winding numbers energetically expensive",
    ", there is a free energy barrier to being at @xmath7 .",
    "our method of determining the rate is to find the probability distribution of @xmath0 , and to multiply the chance to be in a narrow range about @xmath7 by the mean crossing time of that range , set by @xmath8 .",
    "then we need to determine what fraction of crossings are permanent .    in the continuum ,",
    "the meaning of @xmath0 , modulo 1 , is the integral of @xmath9 , @xmath10^a \\right ) \\ , .\\ ] ] here @xmath11 parameterizes a path through the space of 3-d configurations .",
    "the constant of integration is set by defining @xmath12 in vacuum .",
    "this is consistent since the above integral around any closed loop is the second chern class of the loop , which is an integer .",
    "however , to make a nonperturbative study we need to find a lattice implementation for the above , which is touchy since no lattice definition of @xmath9 is a total derivative .",
    "the best thing to do is to use the above definition for a unique specific path , the cooling path , defined by @xmath13 with @xmath14 the yang - mills part of the 3-d hamiltonian .",
    "this definition of @xmath0 is unique because the cooling path is ; it is also minimally exposed to lattice problems since the cooling process very quickly eliminates uv fluctuations , which are responsible for any poor behavior in @xmath9 .",
    "there are three problems we must take care of , though ; a uv noise problem , a numerical cost problem , and the problem of turning a probability distribution for @xmath0 into a rate .",
    "the first problem is that @xmath0 actually is not a very good measurable to be using .",
    "the problem is that it contains a lot of uv noise not related to topology .",
    "our discussion will follow that of ambjrn and krasnitz @xcite . in the uv",
    "the 3-d classical thermal theory we are studying behaves at leading order like 3 copies of the abelian theory , in which @xmath15 the mean square value at leading order in perturbation theory is then @xmath16 which is linearly uv divergent .",
    "the size of the divergence is extensive in volume and will be cut off by the lattice spacing , leading to a @xmath17 behavior .",
    "the solution is not to measure @xmath0 itself , but @xmath0 _ after _ some preliminary cooling has been performed ; @xmath18^a",
    "\\right ) \\ , .\\ ] ] to illustrate that this does the trick , we show @xmath0 and @xmath19 for a period of hamiltonian evolution in the broken phase , and @xmath19 for a sphaleron transition :    this graphically illustrates that using @xmath19 cuts out irrelevant uv noise , while still capturing interesting topological information .",
    "there is still a problem with using @xmath19 , the numerical cost involved in performing the cooling , which we must do thousands of times to get an accurate monte - carlo study of the probability distribution .",
    "we finesse this problem by observing that , since cooling eliminates the uv excitations , it quickly renders the lattice fields smooth enough that we lose no information by blocking by a factor of 2 .",
    "when we use a classically improved hamiltonian and definition of @xmath9 after the blocking , there is almost no difference between the blocked and unblocked measurement of @xmath19 , provided we cool by at least @xmath20 before blocking . for lattices larger than about @xmath21",
    "we can double block .",
    "we can now find the ( @xmath22 dependent ) probability distribution of @xmath19 by conventional multicanonical means . to turn this into a rate , we first measure @xmath23 ( sampled over @xmath24 configurations ) by making a canonically distributed sample of @xmath24 configurations , generating momenta from the canonical ensemble , and evolving for a very short hamiltonian time , measuring @xmath19 before and after .",
    "the mean rate of @xmath24 crossings per 4-volume is then @xmath25    to measure the dynamical prefactor , which is the fraction of crossings which lead to permanent integer change in @xmath0 , we use the same @xmath24 sample but continue the hamiltonian time evolution , both forward and backward in time , until the system settles about a vacuum ; then we count how many crossings and how many permanent @xmath19 changes occur .",
    "the fraction of crossings leading to permanent @xmath19 change is @xmath26 for very large debye mass squared @xmath27 there are multiple crossings , but for realistic @xmath27 the prefactor is about 0.4 .",
    "the final results for @xmath3 are compared to perturbation theory ( two loop effective potential but tree kinetic terms ) in figure [ lastfig ] .",
    "baryon number erasure after the phase transition is prevented if @xmath28 , which occurs if @xmath29 .",
