    "in the last decades , the concept of noise in physical systems has advanced from an unwanted addition to data , towards subject of interest of non - equilibrium statistical physics .",
    "noise is used to simplify descriptions of dynamical systems when the detailed character of interactions is unknown or too complicated for exact methods .",
    "noise is responsible for the occurrence of the so - called noise - induced effects . among them",
    "stochastic resonance @xcite and resonant activation @xcite are the most popular .",
    "usually , it is assumed that noise is white and gaussian , however both non - gaussian and non - markovian extensions are also possible @xcite .",
    "the examination of the constructive role of noises in physical systems has attracted considerable attention during the last two decades .",
    "resonant activation @xcite is a resonant effect in which a noise - induced transition is further facilitated by a modulation of the energy landscape .",
    "a deterministic or stochastic modulation of the potential barrier can improve the system performance leading to the optimal escape kinetics as measured by the mean first passage time .",
    "such a situation is observed for a white gaussian noise @xcite , @xmath0-stable lvy type noises @xcite , colored noise @xcite or even in situations when the potential barrier is modulated by a colored process @xcite .    here , we extend studies on resonant activation into a non - markovian and non - gaussian regime .",
    "we study a non - markovian continuous time random walk scheme in a stochastically modulated potential when jump lengths are generated according to heavy - tailed distributions .",
    "the non - markovianity of the studied process emerges due to slower - than - exponential decay of the waiting time distribution .",
    "this process is also non - gaussian because jump lengths are determined by a heavy - tailed distribution with the diverging second moment . on the one hand ,",
    "the description of anomalous systems can be provided by the continuous time random walk scheme which allows for a relatively easy treatment ( exact or asymptotic ) of various waiting time and jump length distributions resulting in the unified description of markovian / non - markovian and gaussian / non - gaussian systems @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "such realms due to a slow decay of the waiting time distribution and power - law tails of the jump length distribution are described by the bi - fractional diffusion equation @xcite which provides an equivalent description of the continuous time random walk framework .",
    "as the waiting time distribution becomes of the power - law , heavy - tailed type , the system drifts into a non - markovian regime .",
    "consequently , the standard way of identifying resonant activation fails , as the mean first passage time diverges due to heavy - tailed distributions of waiting times .",
    "while this could be taken as an indication of the disappearance of the resonant activation phenomenon , we show that the effect of optimal escape kinetics can still be detected . in order to prove the existence of resonant activation , we use robust , quantile - based measures , which can be defined regardless of the existence of the mean first passage time .",
    "quantile - based measures provide robust characteristics of the first passage time density and as a such can be used to expose the signature of resonant activation . in this study , in addition to the examination of the properties of first passage time distributions , we also use extreme statistics and their properties .",
    "extreme statistics provides additional insight into systems dynamics .",
