    "quantum information , qi is one of the most important events which has considerable progress theoretically and experimentally . to manipulate qi ,",
    "as sending , coding , etc , one needs entangled quantum channel for these proposes .",
    "there are several efforts that has been done to generate entangled channels .",
    "these channels have been demonstrated in many different types of systems , such as photons @xcite , ions @xcite , atoms @xcite and charged qubit@xcite .",
    "all these types of quantum channels have been used to perform different quantum information tasks as quantum teleportation @xcite , dense coding , cryptography .",
    "natural computing is a computational version of the process of extracting ideas from nature to develop computational systems to perform computations @xcite .",
    "one of the most promising type of quantum channels are the neural networks , nn .",
    "this field contains several basic ideas , as concept of processing elements ( neurons ) , which represent the correlated processor units , the transformation performed by these elements and the network dynamics @xcite . due to its potential in describing the brain function ,",
    "the nn has attracted much attentions , where it represents a model of parallel distributed memory @xcite .",
    "in fact nn , can compute any computable functions , so it is classified as neurocomputer .",
    "also , nn is useful for classification and pattern recognition @xcite .    quantum neural network , qnn represents a type of artificial nn , where it has all the features of nn @xcite .",
    "it is one of a typical approaches to study the human brains , where the information processing in the brain is mediated by the dynamics of a large interconnected neuronal populations . on the other hand ,",
    "the basic components of neural cytoskeleton are very likely to possess quantum mechanical properties due to their size and structure @xcite . as an example the tubuline protein has the ability to flip from one conformation to another .",
    "these two conformations act as two basis states of the system .",
    "also the system can lie in a superposition of these two states , which can give a plausible mechanism for creating a coherent state in the brain @xcite .",
    "there are different models that have been considered for qnn . as an example , in @xcite the authors have proposed a model that is a multilayered neural network and investigated its characteristic features , such as the effect of quantum superposition and probabilistic interpretation .",
    "a model of recurrent quantum neural network has been introduced by behera et al @xcite , where they used a linear neural circuit to set up the potential field in which the quantum brain is dynamically excited . also a theoretical quantum brain has been proposed using a nonlinear schrdinger wave equation @xcite .",
    "a learning method has been proposed for quantum neural network by kingo et al .",
    "shafee @xcite has suggested another model by replacing the classical neurons by quantum bits and quantum operators in place of the classical action potentials observed in biological contexts .",
    "@xcite , have suggested a model of qnn , where they used the trapped ion chain as quantum neural network .",
    "based on the universality as single qubit rotation gate and two - qubit controlled -not gate , panchi and shiyong have constructed a quantum neuron model @xcite .",
    "communication at long distances in unknown environments often requires combatting noise that may affect or destroy data before it has reached to its intended destination .",
    "it is well known that , entanglement provides miracle performances in the transmission of quantum information , where it enables the transmission of quantum state by sending only classical information bennt . recently ,",
    "hayashi @xcite investigated the effect of the prior entanglement on quantum network coding .",
    "this leads us to our aim ; investigating the effect of non - maximal entangled state ( due to the noise the maximum entangled states turn into partially entangled states ) on the efficient of sending quantum state via quantum teleportation through a neural quantum network .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a partially entangled quantum neural network , qnn where each neuron entangled with its neighbor .",
    "this entangled networks between neurons are used to send information from one neuron to another .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec.2 , the properties of the qnn are reviewed . sending information between neurons is achieved by quantum teleportation is described in sec.3 . the spread of swine flu virous , as an application of quantum teleportation via neural network , is discussed in sec.4 .",
    "finally sec.@xmath0 , is devoted to discuss our results .",
    "a neuron is defined as a two logical state of usual bit `` yes , no '' or `` false , true '' or `` of , on '' and so on . also , one can express the state of the neuron as a superposition of the false and true representation as @xmath1 where with probability @xmath2 the neuron is in state @xmath3 i.e `` no '' has information(unfired ) , while it is in state @xmath4 i.e `` yes '' carries information ( fired ) with probability @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in qnn , a neuron receives @xmath7 real input signals from many other neurons by network channel .",
    "also , the output of a neuron can `` fan - out '' , the number of the input signals that can be driven by a single output , to several other neurons .",
    "so , we can express on the collective response of all neurons as @xmath8 where @xmath9 , represent the states of the input neurons and @xmath10 is the corresponding weight",
    ". the neural network processing can be implemented by an operator @xmath11 , acting on the input states and propagates the information forward to calculate the output state of the neuron as    @xmath12    where , @xmath11 is unknown operator that can be implemented by the gate of the neural network . on the other hand , in quantum computation",
    "the evolutionary operators must be unitary .",
    "if we consider the case where @xmath13 , i.e , identity operator , the output of quantum perceptron is given by @xmath14 this means that quantum preceptron can be defined as a quantum system consists of n - neuron input register and in this case , we have only considered quantum neural network . to achieve quantum computation ,",
    "the logical function can be performed by applying a group of unitary operations on the neuron states .",
    "these operations are called logic gates , which transform the information of the input neuron states to the output ones .",
    "the most basic universal gates is the single rotation gate , controlled not gate ( cnot ) , entangling gate and hadamard gate .",
    "since we are interested to employ the qnn into the quantum teleportation , we shell describe the cnot and hadamard gates in our notations .",
    "the effect of the cnot operation is defined by ,    @xmath15    while hadamard is , @xmath16",
    "in this section , the entangled neural network is used to perform the original quantum teleportation protocol @xcite . to achieve this task",
    "we assume that the neural network is built on the postulates given by shiafee shafee . in this consideration",
    "the neuron is represented by qubit , such that the state of the neuron is described by equation([neuron ] ) .",
    "let us assume that the neural network is partially entangled .",
    "this means that the state of each two neighboring neurons is non maximal entangled states .",
    "assume that the state of any two connected neurons is defined by the density operator , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 and @xmath20(see @xcite ) .",
    "if , we put @xmath21 , one gets the maximum bell state @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the following describes the steps to implement the bennett protocol @xcite .    1 .",
    "_ step one _ : a neuron @xmath23 has got information from another neuron @xmath24 ( which can be order , computing , decision , etc .. ) . the aim of neuron @xmath23 is transferring these information to another neuron @xmath25 , which is a member in the network .",
    "let us assume that the unknown information coded in the neuron state @xmath26 and the neurons @xmath23 and @xmath25 share an entangled neuron state defined by @xmath27([nerstate ] ) , then the total state of the system is given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 .",
    "2 .   _ step two : _",
    "neuron @xmath23 performs local operations on his state and the neuron @xmath30 .",
    "these local operations include the cnot operation which is a two neurons gate as defined by ( [ cnot ] ) .",
    "after this operation one gets @xmath31 where @xmath32 , is a unitary operator effects on the neuron @xmath25 . the second operation is the hadamard operation ( [ had ] ) , which transform the state @xmath33 to @xmath34 3 .",

    "this is clear from fig.@xmath37 .",
    "so if we were able to control the laboratory devices to generate entangled channel to minimize the fidelity , one can reduce the rate of infections .",
    "also , from theoretical point of view , if the receiver makes some kind of rotation , one can reduce the rate of infection between young .    in fig.@xmath48 , we plot the probabilites @xmath63 which represent the non - infected and inflected probabilities respectively .",
    "fig.(2a ) , shows the behavior of the probability of an old non - infected person , @xmath40 . from this figure",
    "it is clear that the person is completely non - infected i.e @xmath64 for large values of the network strength .",

    "this is clear from fig.(1b ) , for @xmath67 and the amplitude , @xmath68 . from these figures",
    "we can see that the strength of the channel and the rate of infection playing a central role in the behavior of the spreading the virous .",
    "these results are shown clearly in fig.(1c ) and fig.(1d ) , where we plot the contour diagram for the probabilities @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this description gives a clear vision for the effect of the rate of infection and the network strength . from these figures",
    ", we can notice that there is gradual change from completely dark regions to shine ones .",
    "this means that the probability increases gradually from almost zero at ( completely dark region ) to a maximum value for the completely shine regions . as an example , in fig.(1c ) the brightness decreases as one increases the strength of the network , but the effect of the infection rate appears much earlier .",
    "this means that for large values of @xmath45 , the degree of entanglement of the neural network increases and then the possibility of the infection increases .",
    "so at @xmath21 , the probability @xmath40 is almost zero , therefore there is an infection .",
    "conversely , in fig.(1d ) , the shine regions increases as one increases the network strength , @xmath45 and the infection rate @xmath44 .",
    "this confirm what has been displayed in fig.(1b ) , where the probability of infection @xmath69 at @xmath21 .    , but for non - infected young ( figs.@xmath55 ) and the infected in ( figs.@xmath42 ) and the receiver measures @xmath70 .",

    "one can see that for small values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the young is not infected , but the symptoms of disease appears as one increases the strength @xmath45 only . as a remark , for large values of @xmath44 and small values of @xmath45 , the degree of infection is maximum ( see fig.(3a ) ) .",
    "also for the probability of infection is plotted in fig.(3a ) , where both parameters play an important role on the behavior of @xmath73 .",
    "this behavior can be seen clearly from the contour graph for each of @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the probabilities @xmath72 and @xmath73 are displayed as contour diagram in fig.(3c ) and fig.(3d ) respectively .",
    "in fig.(3c ) , the shining region increases for both parameters , but the dark region is larger than the bright one .",
    "this means that the probability of non - infected is smaller than the probability of infected .",
    "the converse behavior is seen in fig,(3d ) , where the dark region ( non - infected ) is very small compared with the shine regions which represents ( infection ) .",
    "finally , the behavior of the probabilities @xmath74 and @xmath75 are shown in fig.@xmath76 , where the receiver measures @xmath77 . in fig.(4a ) , we plot the probability of a non - infected young , @xmath74 .",
    "this figure shows that the probability increases the network strength increases and it is almost zero for small values .",
    "this means that for small values of @xmath45 , the probability that the young is infected is increases .",
    "this phenomena is shown in fig,.@xmath78 , where @xmath79 as one decreases the network s strength .",
    "the confirmation of these results is shown in figs.@xmath80 , where the dark regions appear for a small range of @xmath44 and @xmath45 as shown in fig.@xmath81 , while it increases for a large range of these parameters . finally concerning the last possibility which for old non - infected is represented by the probability @xmath82 and infected old with probability @xmath83",
    ", we can see that they have the same behavior of @xmath75 and @xmath74 .",
    "in other words , the probability for non - infected old equals to the probability of infected young and the probability that old infected equals the non - infected young .",
    "so , we obtain the same behavior and there is no need to re - plot them .",
    "in this contribution , we employ the quantum neural network to achieve the quantum teleportation protocol . in our treatments",
    "we assume that the neurons are connected with unperfect channels .",
    "the sensitivity of the fidelity of the transmitted information is investigated for the network s parameter as well as for the structure of the input information . for large values of the channel parameter ,",
    "the channel becomes a maximum entangled and consequently the fidelity is maximum .",
    "the idea of quantum teleporation is applied on a practical example , where we investigate the possibility of controlling on the spread of swine flu virus . in this context , we show that the virous can be transformed to a similar segment of society with different probabilities .",
    "also , it has been shown , that the case of patients has no effect on the spread of the virus for some possibility .",
    "for other possibility the degree of infection plays the central role , while for some other cases both parameters paly an equivalent role . on the other hand , by local rotations young people can avoid hin1 infection .",
    "we note that in this protocol we used a quantum neural network consists of two neurons .",
    "we believe that there are many factors affecting the spread of swine flu virus .",
    "therefore , we can develop this protocol to include many of the human factors and external factors , and then strategies can be developed to understand the process of transmission .",
    "in fact , this protocol was an attempt to understand the theory of the spread of the virus as an application of quantum neural networks .",
    "and we hope that this study contributes to a vision to reduce the spread of the epidemic .",
