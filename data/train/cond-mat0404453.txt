    "<S> we carried out numerical experiments on a one - dimensional driven lattice gas to elucidate the statistical properties of steady states far from equilibrium . by measuring the bulk density diffusion constant @xmath0 , the conductivity @xmath1 , the intensity of density fluctuations @xmath2 , we confirm that the einstein relation @xmath3 , which is valid in the linear response regime about equilibrium , does not hold in such steady states . here , @xmath4 is the environment temperature , and the boltzmann constant is set to unity . recalling that the einstein relation provided the first step in the construction of linear response theory </S>",
    "<S> , we attempt to extend it to a generalized form valid in steady states far from equilibrium . in order to obtain new relations among measurable quantities , </S>",
    "<S> we define a complex effective temperature @xmath5 from studying the static response of the system to a slowly varying potential in space . replacing @xmath4 in the einstein relation by the real part of the effective temperature @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> , we numerically confirm that the relation @xmath7 holds in the nonequilibrium steady states far from equilibrium that we study . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this extended form , we find the new relation @xmath8 , where @xmath9 represents the propagation velocity of density fluctuations .    </S>",
