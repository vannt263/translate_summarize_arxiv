    "the casimir effect which was predicted more than 60 years ago @xcite has recently attracted much theoretical and experimental attention ( see the monographs @xcite for a overview of the subject ) .",
    "the casimir force originates from quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field .",
    "thus , it is of the same origin as the van der waals force , but acts at larger separations between the interacting surfaces where relativistic retardation effects become significant .",
    "the unified theory of both the van der waals and casimir forces was developed by lifshitz @xcite .",
    "it describes the free energy and force of the van der waals and casimir interaction using the frequency - dependent dielectric permittivity of interacting bodies .",
    "the casimir force acting between two neutral surfaces becomes dominant at separations below @xmath0 m .",
    "until the last decade there was a lack of experimental information about this quantum phenomenon , but this situation has changed in recent years due to rapid progress in nanotechnology . following two landmark experiments @xcite ,",
    "many measurements of the casimir and casimir - polder ( atom - wall ) forces have been performed with metal , semiconductor and dielectric surfaces ( a review of all experiments can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    the experimental and theoretical investigation of the casimir force at nonzero temperature produced an unexpected result .",
    "it turned out that if conduction electrons in metal plates with perfect crystal lattices are described by the dissipative drude model , this results in a violation of the nernst heat theorem in the lifshitz theory @xcite .",
    "the same takes place for dielectric - type semiconductor and dielectric test bodies if free charge carriers , which are unavoidably present at nonzero temperature , are described by the drude - type contribution to the dielectric permittivity @xcite .",
    "the parameter range , where a violation occurs , was recently rederived and extended also to the geometry of a sphere above a plate @xcite . it was demonstrated that for metals with impurities the nernst heat theorem in the lifshitz theory is preserved @xcite . however , in the case of metals with perfect crystal structure ( which is the basic model used in condensed matter physics ) , and for dielectrics , a satisfactory solution was not found .",
    "this even resulted in the attempts @xcite to modify the lifshitz theory , and this led to a controversial discussion in the literature @xcite . from the experimental side",
    ", it was shown that data exclude the lifshitz theory , if the role of conduction electrons is taken into account by means of the dissipative drude model .",
    "this was repeatedly demonstrated for metal @xcite , semiconductor @xcite and dielectric @xcite test bodies .",
    "all modern experiments measuring the casimir force ( with the single exception of the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite which was burdened by rather large error of about 15% ) were performed using the configuration of a sphere above a plate .",
    "bearing in mind that contradictions between lifshitz theory and thermodynamics , and experimental data discussed above , are of great concern for the foundations of quantum statistical physics @xcite , it is worthwhile to consider the possibilities of alternative experiments .",
    "one more configuration of great promise that was discussed in the literature @xcite is a cylinder parallel to a plane plate . in some sense",
    "it is intermediate between the configurations of two parallel plates and a sphere above a plate , by preserving some advantages of the latter while making the problem of preserving the parallelism less difficult than for two plates .",
    "an additional advantage is that the casimir force in the cylinder - plate geometry was recently calculated exactly in an ideal metal case @xcite .",
    "this allows one to reliably estimate possible errors introduced from the use of the proximity force approximation .",
    "the original proposal @xcite considered a relatively large cylinder with length @xmath1 cm and diameter @xmath2 mm separated from the plate with a wide gap @xmath3 m .",
    "it has been shown @xcite , however , that for metal coated spherical lenses with centimeter - size curvature radii , the electrostatic calibration of casimir apparatus meets serious difficulties .",
    "specifically , the residual potential difference may become dependent on separation , and the force - distance relation for the electric force deviates from the form predicted by classical electrodynamics in a sphere - plane geometry .",
    "( this does not happen in the experiments of refs .",
    "@xcite dealing with spheres of about @xmath4 m in radius interacting with the plate of an oscillator . )",
    "similar anomalies were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for the configuration of a cylindrical lens above a plate with lens parameters @xmath5 mm , @xmath6 mm . in ref .",
    "@xcite this anomalous behavior of the electric force was attributed to unavoidable deviations of the mechanically polished and ground surfaces from the perfect spherical shape assumed in elecrodynamical calculations . as recognized in ref .",
    "@xcite , the same effect might be responsible for the calibration problems arising in the case of a centimeter - size cylinder above a plate .",
    "because of this , the consideration of much smaller cylinders seems to be preferable .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the possibility of combining the advantage of high precision provided by the setup of a micromachined oscillator and of a cylinder - plate configuration with a cylinder radius of about @xmath7 m .",
    "for this purpose we consider the thermal casimir interaction between a metallized plate and a microfabricated metal coated cylinder attached to a micromachined oscillator .",
    "the potentially increased precision of force measurements combined with the significantly decreased sizes of cylinders , as compared with refs .",
    "@xcite , requires computations of the thermal casimir force with a more sophisticated account of such factors as the lack of parallelism of the cylinder and plate and the finiteness of the length of a cylinder .",
    "hncre , we derive the lifshitz - type formulas for the casimir force and for its gradient for a cylinder and a plate made of real materials using the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) .",
    "the accuracy of the results is determined by a comparison with the exact expressions available for a cylinder and a plate made of ideal metal @xcite .",
    "computations of the thermal correction to the casimir force and to its gradient using the resulting formulas are performed in the framework of different theoretical approaches proposed in the literature .",
    "the correction to the casimir force and its gradient due to the lack of parallelism of a plate and a cylinder is determined in the nonmultiplicative way .",
    "the error due to the finiteness of the length of a cylinder is estimated using the results obtained with the help of world - line numerics @xcite .",
    "both static and dynamic experiments measuring the casimir force and its gradient in the cylinder - plate configuration using a micromachined oscillator are proposed .",

    "the lower half of the cylinder surface is described by the equation @xmath13 we approximately replace this half with a set of thick plane plates extended along the @xmath9 axis made of the same material as the cylinder and parallel to the oscillator plate .",
    "let us suppose that the casimir pressure @xmath14 between each of these plates and its projection on the plane @xmath8 at temperature @xmath15 is known . according to the derjaguin method @xcite , under the condition @xmath16 the casimir force acting between a cylinder and a plate",
    "can be approximately calculated as @xmath17 where integration holds over the projection of a cylinder on the plane @xmath8 .",

    "although the immediately planned experiments are for metallic test bodies , the case of a dielectric cylinder above a dielectric plate is also of some experimental interest . for dielectrics with a finite dielectric permittivity at zero frequency , @xmath70 , the high - temperature behavior of the casimir force",

    "i , the drude and the plasma model approaches lead to drastically different predictions for the thermal correction to the casimir force in the sphere - plate geometry .",
    "here , we perform all computations using both approaches in order to find additional evidence which could help to resolve this difference . note that simple drude and plasma models , which do not take interband transitions into account , were used in ref .",

    "this is typical for a drude model approach in the configurations of two parallel plates and a sphere above a plate as well .",
    "it should also be noted that the relative thermal correction achieves rather large values at short separation distances .",
    "specifically , at experimentally relevant separations @xmath95 , 200 , 300 , 500 , and 750 nm the thermal correction to the casimir force is equal to 1.8% , 2.7% , 4.6% , 8.6% , and 13.9% , respectively . at the same respective separations the thermal correction to the gradient of the casimir force achieves more moderate values 0.1% , 1.6% , 2.9% , 5.6% , and 9.3% . the magnitude of the relative thermal correction to the casimir force @xmath96 achieves its maximum value 41.6% at @xmath97 m , while the maximum magnitude of the thermal correction to the gradient of the casimir force @xmath98% occurs at @xmath99 m .",

    "2(a , b ) , at short separations the relative thermal correction obtained within the plasma model approach is negligibly small .",

    "in this section we propose an experiment to measure the casimir interaction between a cylinder and a plate using an approach similar to what was used in previous studies for sphere - plate geometry @xcite . a sensitive micromechanical torsional oscillator ( mto )",
    "is at the heart of the setup since it allows detection of the casimir force in a very precise manner .",
    "an incorporated optical fiber two - color interferometer allows the measurement of the fiber - to - substrate separation at all times .",
    "as it was done in our previous experiments , an electrostatic calibration will allow us to determine the interaction force , as well as the separation @xmath12 .",
    "we propose to integrate a metallic cylinder onto a mto and to detect the deflections experienced by the micromechanical device when a metallic plate approaches the cylinder from above ( see fig .  4 for a schematic of the setup ) .",
    "section  ii presents theoretical results for the casimir force and for the gradient of the casimir force between a cylinder and a plate .",
    "both these quantities can be measured using the suggested setup .",
    "the casimir force is measured in the static mode @xcite .",
    "the gradient of the casimir force is measured in the dynamic mode , where the separation distance between a cylinder and a plate is varied harmonically at the resonant frequency of the mto @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup allows for a force sensitivity of @xmath200pn and a determination of the resonant frequency of the mto to better than 6mhz . in the dynamic mode",
    ", the gradient of the casimir force is obtained from the resonant frequency of the oscillator @xmath201 here , @xmath202 is the natural angular resonance frequency of the oscillator , @xmath203 is the angular resonant frequency of the oscillator in the presence of the casimir force , @xmath204 is the lever arm of the interaction , and @xmath205 is the moment of inertia of the oscillator .    in order to minimize errors associated with misalignments between the torsional axis of the mto and the cylinder s axis , we propose to integrate the metallic cylinder onto the mto using state - of - the - art semiconducting processing .",
    "currently available lithographic steppers allow alignment between different structural layers in a mechanical device with an accuracy of 20 nm or better . by using a monolithic fabrication process",
    "it would be possible to directly fabricate a metallic cylinder on top of a mto similar to the one previously used . in order to fabricate a cylinder with a pre - determined cylindrical shape and smooth surface it will be necessary to use grayscale masks or laser based maskless lithography technology @xcite .",
    "these technologies permit the creation of three - dimensional structures with smooth surfaces and precise critical dimensions .",
    "a simpler method to fabricate a cylindrical object on top of a mto involves deposition and patterning of photosensitive polymers ( photoresist ) , and subsequent thermal reflow of the polymer into a curved shape .",
    "this technique relies on surface tension and plastic flow of photoresist and is used to produce smooth curved objects .",
    "reflow techniques are much simpler to implement than grayscale lithography techniques , but they are much more limited regarding the final shape of the cylindrical objects .",
    "the photoresist shape can be transferred to the mto using conventional dry etching techniques like reactive ion etching ( rie ) .",
    "once the cylindrical shape has been transferred to the mto it can be coated with a metallic film by evaporation or sputtering methods .",
    "the actual cylindrical shape @xmath206 can be measured very precisely , better than 1 nm error in @xmath37 , by using a non - contact optical profilometer .",
    "once this shape is known , it can be introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) to calculate the casimir force acting on the cylinder , as described in sec .",
    "ii .    during the measurements",
    ", the cylinder - mto structure will be brought close to the au - coated plane using a 5-axis manipulator with an angular error of 10@xmath207 radians .",
    "this angular error allows for an alignment of the cylinder and the plate to within the ranges calculated in sec .",
    "further improvements in the alignment between the axis of the mto and the plate can be obtained by sacrificing the ability to perform continuous measurements as a function of separation . in this approach",
    "the oscillator / cylinder unit is manufactured as previously described , but the au - coated plate on a si substrate is engineered with three equal pillars of known height .",
    "the mto chip is positioned on top of the pillars and a measurement of the casimir interaction at a fixed separation can be performed . by changing the height of the pillars it is feasible to reproduce a curve of the casimir interaction as a function of separation .",
    "since the height of the pillars can be controlled to better than 10 nm , misalignments smaller than 1@xmath208rad are possible .",
    "in the foregoing we have investigated the possibilities of measuring the thermal casimir force and its gradient between a plate and a microfabricated cylinder attached to a micromachined oscillator . using the pfa we have derived the lifshitz - type formulas for the thermal casimir force for a cylinder and a plate made of real materials . from the comparison with exact results available for an ideal metal cylinder above a plate and for both ideal and real metals in the configuration of a sphere above a plate",
    ", we have estimated the error resulting from the use of the pfa .",
    "it turns out that for reasonable experimental parameters this error does not exceed a small fraction of a percent . in the limiting case of high temperature ( large separation )",
    "the analytic expressions for the casimir force and its gradient are obtained .",
    "the derived lifshitz - type formulas were used to perform numerical computations of the thermal correction to both the casimir force and its gradient . in so doing the two alternative theoretical approaches proposed in the literature ( the drude model and the plasma model approaches ) have been used .",
    "the predicted results of both static and dynamic experiments for the measurement of the thermal correction were discussed . specifically , it was concluded that the thermal correction , as predicted by the drude model approach , is large enough to be measurable at short separations below @xmath0 m . with respect to the thermal correction predicted by the plasma model approach",
    ", it can be measured only at separations of a few micrometers .",
    "the performed computations , when compared with the experimental data , may shed additional light on the experimental exclusion of the drude model approach in refs .",
    "@xcite which was made using only the configuration of a sphere above a plate .    keeping in mind the applications of the developed formalism for comparison with experimental data , we have derived expressions for the thermal casimir force and its gradient taking into account the nonparallelity of the cylinder and plate .",
    "this was done in a nonmultiplicative manner including the role of correlations between geometrical and material properties . in the specific case of ideal metal bodies at zero temperature ,",
    "the previously obtained results were confirmed . we have also performed numerical computations of a correction to the casimir force due to nonparallelity of a cylinder and a plate using both nonmultiplicative and multiplicative approaches , and determined the application region of the latter .",
    "taking into account that microfabricated cylinders to be used in experiments are restricted in length ( which may be of the order of the cylinder radius ) , we have estimated errors in computations arising from the finiteness of a cylinder .",
    "the two experimentally relevant cases were considered when the cylinder is completely over the plate or is partially beyond the plate edge . in both cases",
    "it was shown that for typical experimental parameters the total error due to application of the pfa and due to edge effects is sufficiently small , and does not depend on the ratio of the cylinder radius to the cylinder length .",
    "this opens opportunities for using cylinders with @xmath209 , with no loss in the accuracy of the theoretical expressions derived for infinitely long cylinders .",
    "we have presented a scheme of the proposed experiment for measuring thermal casimir force and its gradient in the configuration of an au - coated plate and a microfabricated cylinder attached to the micromachined oscillator .",
    "both the static and dynamic versions of this experiment are considered .",
    "the values of main experimental parameters that are aimed to achieve are estimated .",
