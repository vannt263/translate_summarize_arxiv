    "in the past two decades , one of the most important discoveries in modern theoretical physics is the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite , relating strongly coupled field theories to weakly coupled gravity .",
    "it provides a powerful tool to study strongly coupled field systems where traditional methods encounter great challenges or even break down .",
    "fruitful results have been obtained by applying this duality to various areas of modern physics , such as condensed matter physics  @xcite and qcd  @xcite .",
    "one noticeable application of this duality is to study non - equilibrium physics , in particular in the so - called `` holographic thermalization '' topic  @xcite which is an atempt to describe the thermalization process of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) produced in heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite .",
    "although the near - equilibrium physics of the qgp can be understood using a hydrodynamic description  @xcite , the whole process to reach thermal equilibrium is yet not known .",
    "observed data from rhic show that the time scale needed for qgp to reach thermal equilibrium is considerably shorter than expected based on perturbative methods  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the thermalization process of qgp is strongly coupled , and thus motivates us to use ads / cft relation .",
    "according to ads / cft , it is proposed that this thermalization process is dual to the process of a black hole formation in the bulk via gravitational collapse of a scalar field in ads space  @xcite , or to a collapse of a thin - shell matter described by an ads - vaidya metric  @xcite . to probe the detailed process of the thermalization , local - observables in the boundary field theory , such as energy - momentum tensor and its derivatives , are not sufficient . in refs .",
    "@xcite , in the model of the collapsing of a thin - shell , three non - local observables have been proposed to probe the process , the two - point function , the wilson loop and the entanglement entropy .",
    "according to the ads / cft relation , in the semiclassical limit these three non - local observables in the boundary field theory can be evaluated by calculating certain geometric quantities in the bulk geometry . by studying the time evolution of these three non - local observables , and under einstein gravity frame ,",
    "the thermalization process has thus been studied in detail and some interesting results are found .",
    "first , the saturation time which is needed to reach thermal equilibrium depends on the geometric size of the probe in the boundary field theory . probes with smaller size thermalize faster indicating a `` top - down '' thermalization mechanism , which is very much in contrast with the standard `` bottom - up '' paradigm  @xcite from the use of perturbative methods . moreover ,",
    "all probes used show a delay in the onset of the thermalization , an apparent non - analyticity in the end of thermalization , the transition to full thermal equilibrium is instantaneous and these features are independent of dimensionality . finally , for homogeneous initial conditions the entanglement entropy thermalizes slowest , and thus sets a timescale for equilibration that saturates a causality bound .",
    "later , this study is extended to include the effect of chemical potential in the boundary field theory  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which is usually the case in real heavy ion collision processes . in the gravity side , this is dual to introducing a gauge field and considering charged background geometries .",
    "it is found that the time evolution of the three non - local observables exhibit similar behavior as in chargeless case .",
    "the arise of the chemical potential affects the saturation time : the larger the chemical potential , the longer the saturation time .",
    "also the study has been extended to other situations by considering higher curvature corrections  @xcite , non - linear electromagnetic effect  @xcite , angular momentum  @xcite , noncommutative  @xcite and hyperscaling violating geometries  @xcite .",
    "further , it is extended to study holographic thermalization of field theories living in curved spacetimes  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is believed that einstein gravity should be considered as an effective description of the underlying quantum gravity theory ( string theory for example ) at low energy .",
    "thus , it is interesting to study the effect of stringy corrections on the thermalization process . as we have mentioned above",
    ", some work has been done in this directions by considering higher curvature corrections  @xcite .",
    "it is found that the existence of higher curvature corrections considerably affects the thermalization process .",
    "for example , by including the effect of gauss - bonnet terms , the authors in refs .",
    "@xcite found that a larger gauss - bonnet coupling constant will make the saturation shorter , thus leaving the imprint of this stringy effect . in this paper , we would like to consider another kind of stringy effect , the emergence of a dilaton field .",
    "the action we consider is the well - known einstein - maxwell - dilaton action which is a low - energy effective action of string theory  @xcite , where the dilaton couples with the maxwell field in a non - trivial way .    to use the ads / cft relation and study the effect of the dilaton field",
    ", we should first find asymptotically ads solutions with non - trivial dilaton configuration under this frame .",
    "it is a non - trivial task .",
    "amounts of work have been done to explore various solutions of this gravity theory .",
    "non - trivial coupling between the dilaton and the gauge field yields interesting effects on the available spacetimes  @xcite .",
    "however , all of these black hole solutions with non - trivial scalar configuration are not aysmptotically ads . in  @xcite , the authors even argued that , with only one liouville - type dilaton potential besides the cosmological constant , there are no dilaton - ds or ads black hole solutions . after lots of efforts ,",
    "an aysmptotically ads black hole solution was found in ref .",
    "@xcite . by choosing an appropriate combination of three liouville - type dilaton potentials",
    ", the authors successfully obtained the static dilaton black hole solutions which are asymptotically ( a)ds in four and higher dimensions .",
    "this solution has some interesting properties  @xcite and has shown potential applications in cosmology  @xcite .",
    "we will work with this charged dilaton ads black hole , and see if and how the presence of the non - trivial dilaton field affects the thermalization process .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly introduce the charged dilaton ads black hole and then generalize it to obtain its vaidya - like version . in sec .",
    "iii , by applying the three non - local observables , we study the detailed process of thermalization to see the influence of the chemical potential and the dilaton field .",
    "the last section is devoted to summary and discussions .",
    "in this section , we briefly introduce the charged dilation black hole in ads space , and obtain its vaidya - like version by introducing external matter source .",
    "we consider the action of @xmath4-dimensional einstein - maxwell - dilaton gravity  @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath1 is the coupling constant between the dilaton and the maxwell field . when @xmath6 this action reduces to the usual einstein - maxwell - scalar theory , while for @xmath7 the last term in the bracket represents the well - known dilaton - maxwell coupling that appears in the low energy string action in einstein s frame  @xcite .",
    "the dilaton potential is chosen to take the form  @xcite @xmath8 e^{-4(n-2)\\phi/[(n-1)\\alpha]}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + ( n-2)^2 ( n-\\alpha^2 ) e^{4\\alpha \\phi/(n-1 ) } + 4 \\alpha^2 ( n-1 ) ( n-2 ) e^{-2(n-2-\\alpha^2)\\phi/[(n-1)\\alpha]}\\bigg\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the cosmological constant and @xmath10 the ads radius .",
    "this type of dilaton potential can appear in the compactification of a higher - dimensional theory , including various supergravity models in four dimensions  @xcite . from the above action",
    ", we can see that reversing the sign of @xmath1 is equivalent to reverse the sign of the dilaton .",
    "thus , without loss of generality , we can restrict @xmath1 to be non - negative , @xmath11 .",
    "the corresponding equations of motion are @xmath12 they admit a charged dilaton black brane solution  @xcite @xmath13 where the constant @xmath14 .",
    "the dilaton and the electromagnetic fields take the form @xmath15 the remaining components of @xmath16 vanish .",
    "the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 are related to the physical mass @xmath19 and charge @xmath20 of the black brane , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the volume of @xmath23 .",
    "hereinafter , without risk of confusion , we simply call the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 the mass and charge parameter respectively .",
    "the constant @xmath24 is related to the mass and the charge parameters through the relation @xmath25 we should emphasize here that the solution contains three free parameters : @xmath26 , or equivalently @xmath27 .",
    "when @xmath6 , the solution reduces to the well - known reissner - nordstrm - ads black brane .",
    "the holographic thermalization in this case has been thoroughly discussed in refs .",
    "thus , in the following we will mainly focus on the case with @xmath28 . in this case",
    ", we note that the solution is not real for @xmath29 .",
    "we should exclude this region from spacetime , what can be achieved by defining a new radial coordinate @xmath30 as  @xcite @xmath31 the metric becomes @xmath32 with the coordinate @xmath30 now valued in the range @xmath33 .",
    "the dilaton and the electromagnetic field become @xmath34    it can be shown that @xmath35 is a curvature singularity .",
    "the event horizon @xmath36 is the largest root of equation @xmath37 .",
    "depending on the free parameters @xmath27 ( or equivalently @xmath26 ) , there can be two horizons ( inner and outer horizons ) , one degenerate horizon ( extreme case ) and naked singularity .",
    "the hawking temperature on the event horizon is @xmath38 it is not possible to give an analytical expression of @xmath36 .",
    "however , we can express the mass parameter @xmath17 in terms of @xmath36 by solving @xmath37 , which is @xmath39 with @xmath40 . substituting @xmath17 into eq .",

    "extremal case ) . in the latter case ,",
    "if we think of all the parameters but @xmath24 fixed , then the maximum value of @xmath24 corresponding to the extremal case can be obtained by solving @xmath45 , which is @xmath46}{n}\\right)^{2/(n-2)}-1\\right\\}^{-1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for more discussions on the thermodynamical properties of this black brane , see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "according to ads / cft , the above black brane solution is dual to a cft on the boundary with temperature given by eq .",
    "( [ temperature-1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the chemical potential @xmath47 of the boundary cft is related to the asymptotical value of the temporal part of @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath49 . by integrating eq .  ( [ phi_f ] )",
    ", we can obtain the expression of @xmath50 , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a constant corresponding to the electrostatic potential at @xmath53 , which is defined such that the gauge field vanishes at the horizon , i.e. , @xmath54 the precise relation between the chemical potential and the gauge field is subtle because there is a dimension mismatch between the chemical potential in the dual field theory and the gauge field @xmath48 defined in the action eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) .",
    "thus , one has to rescale the gauge field as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a scale with length unit that depends on the particular compactification . at this time",
    ", the chemical potential and the gauge field has the same unit and the duality relation is @xmath57 since the boundary field theory we considered is conformal , the only relevant parameter we can vary is a dimensionless ratio @xmath0 constructed from the chemical potential and the temperature , i.e. , @xmath58 , @xmath59 now we can see that if @xmath1 and @xmath17 are kept fixed , then by varying @xmath24 which is equivalent to varying the charge parameter @xmath18 , we can explore various values of the ratio @xmath0 in the dual field theory . for @xmath60 , when @xmath24 varies from @xmath61 ( vanishing @xmath52 ) to @xmath62 ( vanishing @xmath63 ) , @xmath0 spans the whole range of values , i.e. , from @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "however , for @xmath66 , the situation becomes complicated .",
    "as we will see later , in this case , as @xmath24 runs over the whole range of values , @xmath0 is bounded in a finite range of values .",
    "our goal is to investigate the thermalization process of the boundary field system under a quantum quench .",
    "according to ads / cft , this process can be holographically modeled by the process of a black hole formation in the bulk which can be described by a vaidya - like metric .",
    "thus , in this section , we would like to get the vaiya - like metric by generalizing the black brane solution to be time - dependent .",
    "it is more convenient to work with a new radial coordinate @xmath67 such that the ads boundary lies at @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the metric becomes @xmath69 introducing ingoing eddington - finkelstein coordinate @xmath70 the above metric becomes @xmath71 usually , the vaidya - like version can be obtained by using time dependent mass and charge parameters @xmath72 , that is , @xmath73 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the values of the corresponding parameters at late times .",
    "we can still introduce the parameter @xmath24 , which satisfies the relation eq .",

    "that is , the ingoing falling matter is a thin shell .",
    "thus , in the bulk gravity side , we consider the collapsing of an ingoing falling thin - shell to form a black hole . and",
    "this picture is dual to a sudden energy injection into the field system evolving towards thermal equilibrium .",

    "as we stated above , we mainly focus on the case with @xmath77 . in doing numerical calculations in the following",

    "considering the symmetry of the boundary , we can always choose coordinates such that the two points lie in the @xmath111-axis with coordinates @xmath112 respectively .",
    "other coordinates of the two points are identical . according to the ads / cft duality , in the saddle point approximation the two - point function",

    "the geodesic can be parameterized by only two functions : @xmath113 and @xmath114 , with other coordinates unchanged , where we simply denote @xmath115 .",
    "thus , the induced metric on the geodesic is @xmath116 the length functional of the geodesic is @xmath117 to minimize the length of the geodesic , we need to solve the two equations of motion for @xmath113 and @xmath114 respectively .",
    "the expressions are rather involved and we do not give them explicitly here . considering the symmetry",
    ", we have in mind the picture of the geodesic : starting from one of the two points on the boundary @xmath68 , the geodesic extends into the bulk and after reaching the turning point @xmath118 it turns back and finally ends at another point on the boundary . at the turning point @xmath119 , the derivatives vanish , that is , @xmath120 .",
    "it seems that one can impose the boundary conditions at @xmath119 to solve the two equations of motion .",
    "however , the two equations of motion are singular at @xmath119 , and in practice , to make our numerical calculations available , we would rather impose the boundary conditions at the neighborhood of the turning point @xmath119 , @xmath121 where @xmath122 is a small quantity , with typical order of @xmath83 .",
    "the @xmath123 terms are corrections terms and can be derived by solving the two equations of motion around @xmath119 order by order . in our calculations , we only calculate to order @xmath124 .",
    "the two free parameters @xmath125 and @xmath126 characterizing the turning point of the geodesics are determined by the constraint equations @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a uv - cutoff to make the length of the geodesic finite and @xmath109 is the boundary time .",
    "furthermore , note that the integrand in the length functional eq .",
    "( [ lengthfunctional ] ) does not depend on @xmath129 explicitly .",
    "so if we treat @xmath129 as a `` time '' variable then the corresponding hamiltonian is conserved , which yields the following equation @xmath130 by using it , the length functional can be rewritten as @xmath131    the length of the geodesic @xmath132 is a function of the boundary time @xmath109 . by calculating the length at different boundary times , we can get the time evolution of the two - point function . for convenience ,",

    "these features have been observed in various holographic models for thermalization and can be considered to be universal for strongly coupled field systems .    as we increase the charge @xmath18 , equivalent to increasing the ratio of the chemical potential over temperature @xmath0 of the dual field system for @xmath137 , the initial absolute value of @xmath138 decreases , meaning that the dual field system is initially closer to thermal equilibrium .",
    "however , larger @xmath18 makes the delay time longer and the growth of @xmath138 slower , thus the saturation time to reach thermal equilibrium increases .",
    "this means , for @xmath137 , when we fix the energy injected , that the saturation time increases as @xmath0 increases .",
    "also , we should emphasize that the dependence of the saturation time on @xmath0 is weak , as we can see from the figure .",
    "this dependence of the saturation time on the ratio of the chemical potential over temperature @xmath0 has been observed in the case with standard maxwell term  @xcite and also with non - linear born - infeld term  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , the entanglement entropy of a subregion of the boundary spatial space is dual to the area of a codimension - two extremal surface anchored on the boundary of the chosen subregion . using spherical coordinates @xmath146 and considering the spherical symmetry",
    ", the codimension - two extremal surface can be parameterized by only two functions , @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "thus , the induced metric on the surface is @xmath149 and the area functional is @xmath150 to get the extremal value of the functional , as done in previous two subsections , we need to solve the two equations of motion , not shown here .",
    "the same boundary conditions as eq .",
    "( [ bnycondition ] ) are imposed .",
    "we define a rescaled area @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the volume of the chosen subregion , and study its time evolution during thermalization .    in fig .",
    "6 , we plot the time evolution of the entanglement entropy for various values of @xmath1 and @xmath18 .",
    "the evolution shows a similar behavior as those of the other two non - local observables : for fixed @xmath1 , the saturation time increases as the charge @xmath18 increases . for @xmath137 ,",
    "this means the ratio of the chemical potential over temperature @xmath0 enhances the saturation time . while for @xmath3",
    ", the situation depends on the charge @xmath18 : when @xmath139 , the effect of @xmath0 on the saturation time is to enhance , while the effect is opposite when @xmath141 . moreover , we see once again that the dilaton - maxwell coupling constant @xmath1 has almost no influence on the saturation time , although it indeed affects the whole process .",
    "these results provide further support for the ones obtained from the other two observables .    however , there are some differences comparing to the results of other two non - local observables .",
    "first , the delay time for the entanglement entropy is the shortest .",
    "this is understandable , as entanglement entropy , among the three non - local observables involves most degrees of freedom of the field system and thus is the most sensitive to thermalization .",
    "second , now for all cases with different @xmath1 we show , the behavior of the initial absolute value of @xmath153 as @xmath18 increasing is the same : it decreases as @xmath18 increases .",
    "this is different from results of the other two observalbes , where the initial absolute value of @xmath153 is not a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath18 when @xmath154 .",
    "this is understandable , as the three observables relate to different amounts of degrees of freedom of the boundary field system , and thus may reflect different aspects of the system . as we stated above",
    ", the entanglement entropy involves more degrees of freedom and thus can can reflect more clearly the average state of the field system .",
    "thus it is expected that if all the degrees of freedom of the field system are taken into account , the initial state of the field system gets closer to the thermal equilibrium as @xmath18 increases .",
    "we studied the holographic thermalization process in the presence of a chemical potential and dilaton field .",
    "three non - local observables are used to probe the process , and they together show a rich and consistent picture of the thermalization .",
    "the effect of the chemical potential ( or the charge ) and the dilaton field on the thermalization is explored in detail .",
    "the saturation time increases as the charge @xmath18 increases , which means that the ratio of the chemical potential over temperature @xmath0 enhances the saturation time when @xmath137 .",
    "however , when @xmath1 is larger than @xmath89 , the situation becomes a little complicated : when @xmath18 is smaller than some critical value @xmath102 , the saturation time increases as the @xmath0 increases ; however , when @xmath141 , the behavior is inverse .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath0 is no longer a monotonically increasing function of @xmath18 for @xmath3 .",
    "this is different from cases with standard maxwell term  @xcite or non - linear born - infeld term  @xcite , where @xmath0 is always a monotonically increasing function of @xmath18 .",
    "we also investigate the effect of the dilaton - electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath1 on the thermalization process . this non - trival coupling yields great effects on the availabe background spactimes .",
    "however , it is remarkable to see that it nearly has no influence on the saturation time .",
    "as different @xmath1 in the action defines a different gravity theory and thus corresponds to a different dual field theory , it indicates the universality of the saturation time of this one - parameter field theories to reach thermal equilibrium under quantum quench .",
    "although it has no effect on the saturation time , it indeed leave imprints on the whole thermalization process .",
    "if we fixed the charge @xmath18 , increasing @xmath1 makes the initial state of the dual field system further away from thermal equlibrium , the delay time shorter and the growth of @xmath138 faster .",
    "it is interesting to see if an physical explanation on this point can be given .",
    "we have modelled the thermalization process via the naive gravitational collapse of a charged thin shell .",
    "it can also be modelled by the collapsing of a scalar field as done in refs .",
    "it is interesting to see if this more realistic model can give us more information about the thermalization process .",
    "we leave it for further investigations .",

    "<S> it is found that the saturation time is not always a monotonically increasing function of @xmath0 , the situation depends on @xmath1 . when @xmath2 , larger @xmath0 yields longer saturation time , while for @xmath3 , the situation becomes more complex . </S>",
    "<S> more interesting , we found that although @xmath1 indeed has influence on the whole thermalization process , it nearly does not affect the saturation time , which indicates the universality of the saturation time for the dual one - parameter field theories . </S>"
