    "due to highly nonlinear character of sigma and skyrme models , it is very difficult to build exact solution in both of them .",

    "ansatz_. for skyrme model one of the best known and mostly used is hedgehog _",
    "ansatz _ for spherically symmetric systems , which reduces field equations to a single scalar equation .",
    "it worth mentioning that recently this _ ansatz _ was generalized  @xcite for non - spherically - symmetric cases .",
    "use of hedgehog _",
    "ansatz _ allows study of self - gravitating skyrme models .",
    "in particular , it was demonstrated the potential presence of skyrme hair for spherically - symmetric black - hole configurations  @xcite .",
    "this is the first genuine counterexample to `` no - hair '' conjecture which appears to be stable  @xcite ; its particle - like  @xcite counterparts and dynamical configurations  @xcite have been studied numerically .",
    "after that , more realistic spherically- and axially - symmetric black - hole and regular configurations were studied  @xcite .    apart from spherically - symmetric configurations , of particular interest are cosmologically - type solutions .",

    "the paper  @xcite was a logical continuation of them , as the particular solution of the bianchi - ix cosmological model was described .",
    "the analysis suggests that , based on the static counterpart of this model , the construction of exact multi - skyrmion configurations composed by elementary spherically symmetric skyrmions with non - trivial winding number in four - dimensions is possible  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for possible generalization to higher @xmath10 models ) .    in this paper",

    "the structure of the manuscript is as follows : first we review einstein - skyrme system and derive basic equations , then we study asymptotic case both with and without @xmath7-term .",
    "after that we study general case , address linear stability of the obtained solutions and finally discuss and summarize the results .",

    "one can immediately see from the first of ( [ spec_a1 ] ) , that in @xmath64 case at small @xmath52 we have @xmath53 while at large @xmath52 it is negative , so the dynamics is limited and we have finite - time future singularity at some finite @xmath48 , similar to the @xmath2 , @xmath65 case . in case of negative @xmath7 it is true regardless of @xmath8 , so in the remaining part of the paper we consider @xmath50 only .",

    "so that we can see that in all @xmath49 cases we have oscillatory approach to the corresponding @xmath66 cases , described in the previous section .",
    "actual evolutions curves depends on the initial conditions a bit ( say , period and amplitude of oscillations depend on the initial conditions ) , but general behavior and late - time asymptotes are the same within the same case .",
    "final case to consider is general dynamical @xmath34 with @xmath73 .",
    "as we just saw , with @xmath49 , dynamical @xmath34 cases tend to their @xmath66 counterparts through oscillation  the same behavior have dynamical @xmath34 cases with nonzero @xmath7 .",

    "so for @xmath59 we always have exponential solutions with damping oscillations while for @xmath2 we have either recollapse or exponential solution depending on @xmath7  the same behavior we described in the previous section for @xmath66 case . in fig .",
    "[ pre01](d ) we presented typical behavior in the vicinity of separation of these two regimes  the lower regime experience recollapses while the upper reaches exponential regime ; both regimes experience oscillations .     and @xmath49 case on ( a)(c ) panels : @xmath2 on ( a ) panel , @xmath45 on ( b ) and @xmath6 on ( c ) . on",

    "generally @xmath82 , and actual values we present in fig .",

    "[ pre02](d ) we presented one - dimensional scan on @xmath80  one can see that @xmath79 could be orders of magnitude below @xmath81 .    and",
    "a short summary of this sections findings : we found that the @xmath49 case with generic @xmath34 have three distinct late - time regimes which coincide with those described in the previous @xmath66 section .",
    "so for @xmath2 we have a recollapse , for @xmath45 , the late - time regime is power - law @xmath67 and for @xmath6  it is another power - law @xmath68 . in the general @xmath50 , dynamical @xmath34 case ,",
    "again , similar to the @xmath66 case , we have either exponential solution or recollapse .",
    "the former of them takes place for @xmath59 while the latter for @xmath2 and @xmath65 .",
    "this @xmath82 defined from ( [ l1 ] ) and the actual value for @xmath79 heavily depends on the initial conditions , as presented in fig .",
    "[ pre02 ] .",
    "one can not miss the strong dependence of @xmath79 on @xmath80  more initial anisotropy ",
    "lesser value for @xmath7-term is needed to reach exponential expansion .",
    "now let us turn our attention to the stability of the solutions . in the course of paper we saw there are three nonsingular regimes : two power - law  @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and exponential @xmath92 ; all three regimes have @xmath9 .",
    "so that we perturb full system ( [ full ] ) around solution @xmath93 and with these three different @xmath94 .",
    "linear perturbations around @xmath93 read @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and the equations on perturbations take form    @xmath101    last of ( [ pert ] ) could be solved for stability in @xmath102-direction .",
    "substitution of exponential solution @xmath103 leads us to    @xmath104    using new variable @xmath105 , we can rewrite ( [ pert_exp_1 ] ) as    @xmath106    where @xmath107 could be treated as a perturbative force acting on a system described by homogeneous equation .",
    "the solution of the homogeneous equation from ( [ pert_exp_2 ] ) is    @xmath108    and then we can solve it for @xmath109 :    @xmath110    the solution of the general ( [ pert_exp_1 ] ) equation leads to an expression through m and w whittaker functions  @xcite and generally can not be expressed through elementary functions . but with an analysis performed in ( [ pert_exp_2])([pert_exp_4 ] ) we describe the general behavior as follows : @xmath107 acts as a perturbative force and generates oscillations around ( [ pert_exp_3 ] )  the solution of the homogeneous equation from ( [ pert_exp_2 ] ) .",
    "one can see that at @xmath111 we have @xmath112 so that at late times we can use ( [ pert_exp_3 ] ) as an exact solution , which leads to ( [ pert_exp_4 ] ) as a solution for original perturbation equation ( [ pert_exp_1 ] ) .",
    "one can note that the amplitude of perturbations does not damp to zero  as @xmath111 we have @xmath113 .",
    "the reason behind it is not clear , but as the perturbations do not grow , we treat this case as stable .",
    "our numerical analysis totally supports this description  at the beginning the solution is represented by damping oscillations , but after they decay the asymptote value is not zero but some small constant .",
    "this is the same for a wide variety of the initial conditions and the constant is also the same ; though it varies for different parameters .",
    "now let us turn our attention to the power - law regimes . in that case",
    "the solution of the last of ( [ pert ] ) could be written in terms of j and y bessel functions and is represented by oscillations with damping amplitude , which directly points to stability , as long as solution itself exists .",
    "solution for @xmath114 exists iff @xmath115 and solution for @xmath116 exists iff @xmath117 .",
    "to summarize , we found that the exponential solution behave a bit unusually , but we claim that we could call it stable  the perturbations experience damping oscillations and reach constant value afterwards .",
    "as they do not grow , we claim them to be stable .",
    "the power - law solutions are stable everywhere within their range of existence .",
    "in current paper we considered bianchi - ix cosmological model in einstein - skyrme system ( [ full ] ) .",
    "the original system was simplified and considered with growth of complexity , which allows us to build semi - analytical solution .",
    "purely analytical solutions are obtained for the simplest case with @xmath66 and @xmath40  in that case there are three possible solutions  one with recollapse for @xmath118 and two power - laws ",
    "@xmath3 for @xmath4 and @xmath5 for @xmath6 .",
    "all three are presented in fig .",
    "[ pre01a ] and one can not miss their similarity with three different friedmann solutions from classical cosmology  with spatial curvature @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the scales with time are different but the qualitative behavior is the same  in some sense @xmath121 plays a role similar to the spatial curvature .",
    "further complications of the system act as modifications of the obtained exact solution . turning @xmath34 dynamical ( but with still @xmath40 )",
    "leads to oscillatory behavior like presented in fig .",
    "[ pre01](a)(c ) .",
    "let us remind that oscillatory behavior is a part of early bianchi - ix universe , as discovered by belinskij , khalatnikov and lifshits  @xcite . if one keep @xmath66 but make @xmath50 , then power - law regimes turn to exponential while recollapse regime turn to exponential if ( [ l1 ] ) is satisfied ; if not , they remain recollapse . finally , if one combine both  dynamical @xmath34 with @xmath50 , the resulting trajectories have oscillations and exponential ( de sitter ) late - time asymptote for @xmath59 ; for @xmath2 one have oscillations and de sitter if @xmath122 and recollapse if @xmath65 ; the separation between these two cases is presented in fig .",
    "[ pre01](d ) .",
    "recollapse behavior is also encountered in anti de sitter case ",
    "when @xmath64  and in this case the result is independent on @xmath8 .",
    "the value for @xmath79 can not exceed @xmath81 from ( [ l1 ] ) but could be much less ( orders of magnitude ) , as our numerical investigation suggests . in fig .",
    "[ pre02 ] we provided the distribution of @xmath79 over initial conditions space for three different @xmath80 on ( a)(c ) panels and linear cut over @xmath80 on ( d ) .",
    "one can see that all nonsingular regimes have @xmath9 at late times . from metric ( [ bix ] )",
    "point of view , @xmath93 solution is the most symmetric one ( so that it has more killing fields then @xmath74 one ) , so that we can see that all nonsingular regimes have symmetry restoring dynamics , and all these solutions are stable .",
    "singular regimes , which do not possess this feature , are either @xmath2 cases with @xmath65 or @xmath64 ads cases ; for the latter the value for @xmath8 is irrelevant .    for more physical analysis we use real values for the skyrme coupling constants  @xcite .",
    "then one can immediately see that @xmath123 and so @xmath2 is the case .",
    "for @xmath2 from ( [ sol_nol ] ) one can derive the `` lifetime ''  with real values for couplings substituted , this time appear to be of the order of planck time , which means that without @xmath7-term or some other matter sources with sufficient density , bianchi - ix universe with skyrme would collapse immediately .",
    "on the other hand , on this time scales the space - time can not be described by classical means and additional investigation with involvement of quantum physics is required .",
    "finally , if we substitute coupling constants into ( [ l1 ] ) , the resulting value for the cosmological constant appears to be in agreement with other estimates from quantum field theory , treating it as vacuum energy , and is around 120 orders of magnitude higher than the observed value ( so - called `` cosmological constant problem '' , see e.g.  @xcite ) .    in a sense",
    "the results of current paper complement the results of  @xcite , where we studied bianchi - i and kantowski - sachs universes in einstein - skyrme system . in both papers the cosmological constant ( or probably some other matter field ) is necessary for viable cosmological behavior .",
    "but unlike  @xcite , where we demonstrated need for the upper bound on the value of @xmath7-term , in current paper we found the lower bound .",
    "it is interesting that different topologies in presence of skyrme source require either not too large or not too low values for the cosmological constant .",
    "this finalize our study of bianchi - ix skyrme - einstein system .",
    "we described its dynamics and derived conditions for different regimes to take place .",
    "generally , einstein - skyrme systems are very interesting and are not much considered , probably due to their complexity , so each new result improves our understanding of cosmological hadron dynamics . in particular",
    ", these systems offer the interesting possibility to study the cosmological consequences to have conserved topological charge .",
    "thus the present analysis is quite relevant as the energy - momentum tensor a skyrmions of unit topological charge .",
