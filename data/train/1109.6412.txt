    "in this work , we have investigated the behaviour of the dirac field in closed frw spacetime using np formalism - spinor analysis .",

    "it yields more tractable equations for the eigenfuctions compared to the conventional tensorial method .",
    "it appears to be more natural as it goes into very quantal nature of the fields as illustrated by its ability to explain the absence of super - radiance of neutrinos in kerr spacetime@xcite .",
    "another aspect is the solution of the field equations itself that have become more transparent in revealing the nature of the distributions of the particles and energy .",
    "ultimately all matter is fermionic , so behaviour of dirac field in expanding universe must reveal the unknown features of the universe and also unleash some facts about structure formation .",
    "while the free maxwell and dirac fields , in friedmann - robertson - walker spacetime were investigated using the newman - penrose method , all the variables were found to be separable , and the angular solutions were the spin - weighted spherical harmonics .",
    "the massless fields came to have the usual exponential time dependencies .",
    "all the radial parts reduced to the quantum mechanical barrier penetration problem , with well behaved potentials that are basically the centrifugal energies .",
    "the potentials seen by one component of the dirac field , @xmath130 , are interesting ; its lowest angular momentum state sees no potential in the flat universe , while it sees an attractive one throughout the open universe ; from afar , all angular momentum states of this component see attractive potential in the open universe .",
    "consequences of this effect may provide a means to determine whether the universe is flat , open or closed .",
    "all the radial equations are solved .",
    "we have looked into the properties of the massive dirac field in detail for closed frw spacetime .",
    "the radial dependence in the open universe is also the appropriate limit .",
    "the flat case can be considered to be the limit of either the closed or open cases for @xmath6 .",
    "thus , in the complexified @xmath7 , the closed universe lies along the real axis , open along the imaginary and flat near the origin .",
    "so , we may consider the proposition that , as an overall flat space expands , it fragments into under - density voids that develop locally as an open frw space along the imaginary axis , and the overdensity regions evolve locally into the large scale structures as the closed counterpart .",
    "hence the closed , open and flat universes represent different regions of a complexified space .",
    "the radial dependence is the same for both the massless and massive cases .",
    "the momentum is quantized in steps of unity from the minimum value of @xmath131 .",
    "the quantization condition for the comoving mementum of a gravitationally trapped dirac particle is _",
    "n + 1 , where n@xmath132 is an integer , and the total angular momentum _",
    "l _ is a half integer .",
    "the temporal solution ( eq . [ 2.5 ] ) gives us an important information , viz , . at late times of the evolution / expansion of the universe when @xmath93 , so @xmath94 and @xmath95 , showing that one of the solutions decays in time as the universe expands , while the other solution grows",
    "this leads us to conclude that the former one may be the negative energy solution while the latter is the positive energy solution .",
    "this will be confirmed in future work on the representation of the dirac matrices .",
    "the variations in number densities exist from the very initial time of the big - bang .",
    "there was indication from our early work @xcite that , although the comoving number density of the massless field is locally conserved at every spacetime point , it is not so for the massive case .",
    "even though the universe starts out with equal number of particles with @xmath133 , at late times the former goes down towards zero while the latter grows to unity keeping the sum conserved and equal to unity . as the universe expands and the particles lose their kinetic energy , the time dependence shows that the @xmath134 representing the number of particles in this model will decay while @xmath135 grows",
    "this may be mimicking the behavior of the massive dirac field in minkowski spacetime where the negative energy solutions exist only in the relativistic regime while the positive energy solution dominates in the non - relativistic regime.@xcite .",
    "this could be the source of the local particle current that exists at every point in the frw spacetime .",
    "nonetheless , the total comoving number within the whole volume is still conserved .",
    "further , the currents are set up in such a way that the over - densities are further enhanced while the under - densities get more depleted as the universe expands .",
    "the energy distribution also follows the number distribution .",
    "we find that the number and energy distributions that are setup have exactly the same form as required by the flat ratation curves of galaxies .",
    "the newtonian gravitational potential that is required for the flat rotation curve is that the square of the rotational velocity of the particles , @xmath136 .",
    "our results also show that the plots of the quantities @xmath137 become flat at a short distance from the origin as the figs .",
    "( [ numbercl ] and [ energy ] ) show .",
    "even the surface densities of particles and energy at a distance r show the same nature .",
