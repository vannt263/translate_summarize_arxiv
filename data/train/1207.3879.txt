    "one of the key goals in modern cosmology is to study the formation of the first stars and galaxies at the end of the cosmic dark ages , and how they shaped the subsequent evolution of the universe ( barkana & loeb 2001 ; bromm & larson 2004 ; ciardi & ferrara 2005 ; bromm et al .",

    "the first , so - called population  iii ( pop  iii ) stars are predicted to have formed at @xmath5 in minihalos with virial mass @xmath6 and temperatures @xmath7k ( haiman et al . 1996 ; tegmark et al .",

    "the pop  iii initial mass function ( imf ) is thought to be top - heavy ( bromm et al .",
    "1999 , 2002 ; abel et al . 2002 ) , possibly extending to @xmath8 , but recent simulations indicate that the pop  iii imf may be quite broad , also including a fraction of lower - mass stars ( stacy et al . 2010",
    "; clark et al . 2011b ; greif et al . 2011 , 2012 ) .",
    "the first bona - fide galaxies are expected to have formed at a later stage in hierarchical structure formation ( bromm & yoshida 2011 ) , when @xmath9 halos assembled at @xmath10 via the merging of progenitor minihalos ( wise & abel 2007 ; greif et al .",
    "these systems are often termed ` atomic cooling halos ' , because their virial temperature , @xmath11k , exceeds the threshold to enable efficient cooling via lines of atomic hydrogen ( oh & haiman 2002 ) .",
    "direct observations of the first galaxies at redshifts @xmath12 have so far been out of reach . in the coming decade , the _ james webb space telescope ( jwst ) _ promises to directly probe this critical period ( gardner et al .",
    "the detection of metal absorption lines in the afterglow spectrum of high - redshift gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , imprinted by enriched gas in the first galaxies , offers an unusual opportunity to study the physical conditions inside them",
    ". we may thus be able to derive constraints on the temperature , metallicity , ionization state , and kinematics in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of high - redshift galaxies , and in the surrounding intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "it is encouraging that such diagnostics can already be obtained for bursts at somewhat lower redshifts .",
    "an example is grb  081008 , where high - resolution spectroscopy with the vlt has probed the ism of a host galaxy at @xmath13 ( delia et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "long - duration grbs have been shown to be associated with the death of massive stars ( stanek et al . 2003 ; hjorth et al . 2003 ; woosley & bloom 2006 ) . their high luminosities make them detectable out to the edge of the visible universe ( ciardi & loeb 2000 ; lamb & reichart 2000 ; bromm & loeb 2002 , 2006 ; gou et al .",

    "the leading contender for the central engine of long - duration grbs is the collapsar model ( woosley 1993 ; macfadyen et al . 2001 ) . because of their predicted high characteristic mass",
    ", a significant fraction of pop  iii stars might end their lives as a black hole , potentially leading to a large number of high - redshift grbs .",
    "thus , pop  iii stars are viable progenitors of long - duration grbs , triggered by the collapsar mechanism , as long as they can lose their outer envelope and retain sufficient angular momentum in their center ( bromm & loeb 2006 ; belczynski et al . 2007 ; komissarov & barkov 2010 ; stacy et al . 2011 ) .",
    "it might even be possible for pop  iii collapsars to occur if the extended outer envelope were not lost ( suwa & ioka 2011 ) .",
    "the history of pre - galactic metal enrichment has several important consequences for structure formation ( madau et al .",
    "2001 ; karlsson et al . 2012 ) .",
    "an early phase of metal injection may qualitatively change the character of star formation , from a predominantly high - mass ( pop  iii ) mode to a normal , low - mass dominated ( pop i / ii ) one , once the enrichment has exceeded a ` critical metallicity ' of @xmath15 ( bromm et al .",

    "it is therefore important to explore the topology of early metal enrichment , and to determine when particular regions in the universe become supercritical ( tornatore et al . 2007 ; maio et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "absorption lines imprinted on the spectra of bright background sources , such as grbs or quasars , are one of the main sources of information about the physical and chemical properties of high - redshift systems ( oh 2002 ; furlanetto & loeb 2003 ; oppenheimer et al .",
    "these lines are due mainly to absorption by neutral hydrogen present in the low column - density ly@xmath16 forest , and by metals in low - ionization stages ( e.g. , , , , , ) which arise in the higher column - density gas associated with damped ly@xmath16 absorbers ( dlas ) .",
    "the analysis of the spectrum of distant grb  050904 ( totani et al .",
    "2006 ) has resulted in a wealth of detailed insight into the physical conditions within the host galaxy at @xmath17 , and salvaterra et al .",
    "( 2009 ) claimed that they identified two absorption lines ( and ) , although at poor signal - to - noise , in the spectrum of grb  090423 , the most distant spectroscopically confirmed burst at @xmath18 ( salvaterra et al .",
    "2009 ; tanvir et al .",
    "grbs as background sources offer a number of advantages compared to traditional lighthouses such as quasars ( bromm & loeb 2012 ) .",
    "their number density drops much less precipitously than quasars at @xmath19 ( fan et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the absence of a strong proximity effect , together with the near power - law character of their spectra , renders them ideal probes of the early igm .    in this paper , we discuss the observational signatures of pop  iii grbs and study pre - galactic metal enrichment utilizing absorption lines in the spectra of high-@xmath20 grbs which were imprinted by the first galaxies .",
    "recently , it has become feasible to study the formation of the first galaxies , including the metal enrichment from pop  iii supernovae ( sne ) , with highly - resolved cosmological simulations ( wise & abel 2008 ; greif et al .",
    "we here place a bright grb into the simulation box of greif et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , and derive the spectral signature as the afterglow light escapes from the first galaxy , thereby probing the partially enriched igm in its vicinity .",
    "the fluxes in the near - ir and radio bands may be detectable by the _ jwst _ and the very large array ( vla ) out to @xmath5 .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "we derive the circumburst density profile of pop  iii grbs , followed by a brief description of the underlying first galaxy simulation ( section  3 ) .",
    "we discuss the properties of the grb afterglow in section  4 , and the metal absorption line diagnostics in section  5 , followed by our conclusions .",
    "two different environments are currently discussed as pop  iii star formation sites , minihalos and atomic cooling halos ( bromm et al .",
    "the latter mode is often termed pop  iii.2 to indicate physical conditions , such as a higher degree of ionization , that differs from the canonical minihalo case , possibly resulting in somewhat lower masses ( mckee & tan 2008 ) . for normal grbs , either a constant number - density profile , or a power - law dependence , as might be expected in the stellar wind from the progenitor , is discussed in the literature ( bloom 2011 ) .",
    "the grb afterglow emission sensitively depends on the circumburst density ( ciardi & loeb 2000 ; gou et al .",
    "2004 ; inoue et al .",
    "2007 ) , and this is one of the crucial uncertainties in making predictions for pop  iii bursts .",
    "we next derive the likely circumburst conditions in the two possible pop  iii host systems .      for simplicity , we assume that pop  iii grbs are triggered in minihalos close to the cooling threshold for collapse , which is only weekly dependent on redshift ( yoshida et al . 2003 ) . for definiteness , we choose @xmath21 . to determine the pre - burst density , we need to consider the build - up of the region around the central pop  iii star , and how the density structure is modified through the strong photoionization - heating inside of it ( whalen et al .",
    "the production of ionizing photons strongly depends on the stellar mass , which in turn is determined by how the accretion flow onto the growing protostar proceeds under the influence of this radiation field ( e.g. , mckee & tan 2008 ; hosokawa et al .",
    "2011 ; smith et al . 2011 ; stacy et al .",
    "thus , the assembly of pop  iii stars and the development of an region around them proceed simultaneously and affect each other .",
    "the shallow potential wells in the host minihalos , with corresponding circular velocities of a few kms@xmath22 , are unable to retain photo - ionized gas , so that the gas is effectively blown out of the minihalo .",
    "the resulting photo - evaporation has been studied with 3d radiative transfer calculations ( alvarez et al .",
    "2006 ; abel et al . 2007 ; greif et al . 2009 ) ,",
    "where one massive pop  iii star at the center of the minihalo acts as an embedded point source , that also take into account the hydrodynamic response of the photo - heated gas .",
    "it is possible to understand the key physics of the photoevaporation from minihalos with the self - similar solution for a champagne flow ( shu et al .",
    "2002 ) . assuming a @xmath23 density profile , which describes the typical situation in minihalos outside a nearly flat inner core",
    ", one can reformulate the spherically symmetric continuity and euler equations for isothermal gas as follows : @xmath24{1 \\over \\alpha } { d \\alpha \\over d x }   =   \\left[\\alpha - { 2 \\over x}(x - v ) \\right](x - v ) , \\label{alpha}\\ ] ] @xmath24{d v \\over d x } =   \\left[(x- v)\\alpha - { 2 \\over x } \\right](x - v ) , \\label{vel}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the similarity variable , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 introduce the reduced density and velocity , respectively .",
    "@xmath28 is the sound speed of the ionized gas and @xmath29 the hydrogen mass fraction .",
    "the density globally decreases with time , after the ionizing source has turned on . to derive the immediate pre - explosion value",
    ", we will therefore set @xmath30 yr , the typical lifetime of a massive pop  iii star ( e.g. , bromm et al .",
    "2001b ) .",
    "different solutions are obtained depending on the ratio @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath28 are the initial and ionized isothermal sound speeds .",
    "we take @xmath33 k and @xmath34 , where the virial temperature is defined as @xmath35 the intuition behind the latter identification is that @xmath36 , the specific gravitational potential energy of the gas inside a halo , is a measure of how strongly the fluid is bottled up , before a champagne flow can occur . using table  1 in shu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we can obtain the density profiles at different redshifts as follow .",
    "first , the value of @xmath37 can be calculated at the given redshift .",
    "we then derive the corresponding reduced central density , @xmath38 , via interpolation . for the given @xmath38 we can numerically solve equations ( [ alpha ] ) and ( [ vel ] ) subject to the inner boundary conditions : @xmath39 to avoid the singularity near @xmath40 , shu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) provide the series expansion @xmath41 @xmath42 once the pop  iii star has turned on at @xmath43 , the photo - heating commences , putting in place a pressurized inner bubble which leads to an outward - flowing shock at @xmath44 .",
    "the shock obeys the usual isothermal jump conditions , written in terms of the reduced variables as @xmath45 where the subscript @xmath46(@xmath47 ) indicates the value of the reduced velocity and density upstream ( downstream ) of the shock .    in figure [ shu",
    "] , we show the resulting density profiles at the end of the pop  iii progenitor s life , and therefore at the completion of the photoionization - heating as well . as can be seen ,",
    "the circumstellar densities have dropped significantly from the high values , @xmath0@xmath4 , present prior to pop  iii star formation , and are nearly uniform at small radii .",
    "such a flat density profile is markedly different from that created by stellar winds .",
    "the absence of any wind around a pop  iii star is indeed predicted , as a consequence of very low metallicity ( baraffe et al .",
    "2001 ; kudritzki 2002 ) , and could serve as an indicator of a low-@xmath48 grb progenitor .",
    "the post - photoheating density evolves with redshift , approximately according to @xmath49 , normalized such that @xmath50@xmath4 at @xmath51 .",
    "this law differs from earlier estimates of the pop  iii circumburst evolution , where no @xmath20-dependence was assumed , or a scaling with the density of the background universe , @xmath52 ( e.g. , gou et al .",
    "2004 ) .    this relation can be understood as follows .",
    "prior to the onset of protostellar collapse , the baryonic density profile in the minihalo can be described by the lane - emden equation for an isothermal sphere @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the density at which the gravitational potential @xmath55 is set to zero .",
    "a simple analytical solution to this equation is the well - known singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) : @xmath56 , where @xmath57 .",
    "this law approximately describes the profile found in realistic simulations of first star formation ( e.g. , yoshida et al . 2003 ) , outside an inner core of radius @xmath58pc , the jeans length of the primordial gas ( bromm et al .",
    "the baryonic mass inside the shock radius , @xmath59pc , is about @xmath60 at the end of photoionization - heating , the mass in the flat inner core is about @xmath61 if we neglect any outflows at large radii , we have approximate mass conservation , such that @xmath62 , resulting in @xmath63 , as before .    our post - photoheating densities are consistent with simulation results ( kitayama et al .",
    "2004 ; alvarez et al . 2006",
    "; abel et al . 2007 ; greif et al . 2009 , 2010 ) . we also agree with whalen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , if we take into account that their halo had a somewhat lower mass , @xmath64 .",
    "empirical support is provided in chandra et al .",
    "( 2010 ) who found that the circumburst density of grb  090423 at @xmath18 was about @xmath65@xmath4 by fitting the radio , x - ray and infrared afterglow , although this burst almost certainly did not originate in a minihalo environment .",
    "star formation and radiative feedback inside atomic cooling halos is significantly less well - understood than the minihalo case ( e.g. , johnson et al .",
    "2009 ; safranek - shrader et al .",
    "2010 , 2012 ) , and there are no comparable high - resolution simulations yet . what is the character of star formation , in terms of imf and stellar multiplicity ( clark et al .",
    "2011a ) ? given current uncertainty , we here again use the formalism of the shu solution as developed above .",
    "we further assume for simplicity that either a single pop  iii star forms , or a small stellar cluster , with properties that would again heat the surrounding region to @xmath66k .",
    "we stress that the numbers derived here only provide us with rough guesses at best , and the hope is that simulations will eventually become available to firm them up .    if a cluster of pop  iii stars forms , the time where photoheating stops will be prolonged .",
    "we thus need to evaluate @xmath67 at @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the timescale over which star formation is ongoing , and @xmath70 again is the lifetime of a single pop iii star . we can estimate @xmath71 , because disruptive feedback effects will tend to terminate star formation when the first member stars die .",
    "the resulting densities at the end of photoheating are shown in figure  [ atomic ] .",
    "similar to the minihalo case , densities are nearly constant at small radii , but overall values are much higher .",
    "the reason is that here the potential wells are deeper , so that photoheated gas can more easily be retained .",
    "typical circumburst densities are @xmath72@xmath4 . because such large densities would correspond to high afterglow fluxes , pop  iii grbs originating in atomic cooling halos may be extremely bright , rendering them visible out to very high redshifts .",
    "for some of the most distant bursts known , such large circumburst densities have indeed been inferred .",
    "e.g. , gou et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have argued that fitting the grb  050904 afterglow at @xmath73 requires a circumburst density of a few @xmath74@xmath4 .",
    "similar values have been suggested for grb  080913 at @xmath75 ( greiner et al .",
    "2009 ; zhang et al .",
    "in order to predict afterglow spectra from pop  iii grbs , we consider explosions that are embedded in a realistic cosmological setting .",
    "specifically , we use the first galaxy simulation carried out by greif et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , where the assembly of an atomic cooling halo was tracked , resolving all prior pop  iii star formation in the progenitor minihalos , together with the radiative feedback from regions around those stars .",
    "in addition , the simulation allowed one of the pop  iii progenitor stars to explode as an energetic sn , explicitly following the transport and mixing of the ejected metals into the igm .",
    "we here summarize a few key aspects of the simulation , and refer the reader to greif et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for further details .",
    "the simulation is carried out in a cosmological box of size @xmath76 ( comoving ) , and is initialized at @xmath77 according to a concordance @xmath78 cold dark matter ( @xmath78cdm ) model with matter density @xmath79 , baryon density @xmath80 , hubble parameter @xmath81 , spectral index @xmath82 , and normalization @xmath83 ( spergel et al .",

    "nested , zoomed - in initial conditions , the dm and gas particle masses are @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively , the baryonic mass resolution , roughly given by the mass contained inside an sph kernel , is @xmath86 , close to the relevant jeans mass in the primordial star forming gas . to capture the chemical evolution of the gas",

    "all relevant cooling mechanisms are included , i.e. , h and he atomic line cooling , bremsstrahlung , inverse compton scattering , and collisional excitation cooling via h@xmath89 and hd ( johnson & bromm 2006 ) .    in figure  [ galsim ] , we show the hydrogen number density and metallicity averaged along the line of sight within the central @xmath92 kpc ( comoving ) at two different output times , from @xmath93 , briefly after the first star - forming minihalo has collapsed , to @xmath94 , closer to the virialization of the first galaxy .",
    "the distribution of metals produced by the first sn explosion is highly inhomogeneous , and the metallicity can reach up to @xmath95 , which is already larger than any of the values discussed for the critical metallicity , @xmath96 ( e.g. , bromm et al .",

    "our modeling of the grb broad - band afterglow emission follows standard prescriptions , and we here only briefly summarize the basic physics involved ( for general reviews , see mszros 2006 ; zhang 2007 ) . we specifically consider a relativistic shell ejected from the progenitor of a grb ( e.g. , kobayashi 2000 ) .",
    "the shell has a rest mass of @xmath99 , an observed thickness of @xmath100 , and exhibits an initial lorentz factor of @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the isotropic - equivalent explosion energy .",
    "the interaction between the shell and the surrounding medium with a density of @xmath103 produces a forward and a reverse shock . the shocks , in turn ,",
    "accelerate electrons to high energies , distributed according to a power - law : @xmath104 for @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the internal lorentz factor for the electrons .",
    "the minimum lorentz factor is set by assuming that a fraction @xmath107 of the post - shock energy is transferred to the electrons , resulting in : @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the lorentz factor of the shocked fluid ( e.g. , blandford & mckee 1976 ; sari et al .",
    "if one also assumes that a fraction @xmath110 of the post - shock energy is deposited into random magnetic fields , the gyration of the shock - accelerated electrons around the magnetic field will generate synchrotron radiation , thus giving rise to the afterglow emission .",
    "there is then a second characteristic lorentz factor , @xmath111 , determining the threshold below which electrons do not lose a significant fraction of their energy to radiation . equating the synchrotron cooling time with the expansion time of the shell ,",

    "once the observed frequency corresponds to an emitted frequency above the ly@xmath16 resonance , @xmath146hz , which occurs at @xmath147 for the k - band , all flux will be completely absorbed by the intervening , still largely neutral igm .",

    "the afterglow flux is only weakly dependent on redshift .",
    "the main reason is that cosmic time dilation implies that a given observed time after the trigger corresponds to successively earlier emission times , where intrinsic afterglow luminosities are much brighter ( ciardi & loeb 2000 ; bromm & loeb 2012 ) .",

    "[ radio ] , we show the flux at @xmath152ghz , again after @xmath153 minutes , 1 hour and 1 day . we calculate the sensitivity of the vla , using the following expression ( ioka & mszros 2005 ) @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the integration time , @xmath156 the bandwith , and @xmath157@xmath158k@xmath22 .",
    "the bandwidth of the expanded vla ( evla ) can be up to 8ghz . for a 2h integration in the 8ghz band",
    ", the evla can thus reach a sensitivity of up to 6.4 @xmath159jy , which is shown as a horizontal line in figure  [ radio ] .",
    "we can see that the radio afterglows are easily within reach for the evla , up to @xmath160 ( e.g. , chandra et al . 2010 ) .      according to hierarchical cosmic structure formation , the characteristic halo mass varies as a function of redshift .",
    "thus , the typical observed peak flux and wavelength of pop  iii grbs are also a function of redshift . in the following ,",
    "we derive ballpark estimates for these key quantities by considering @xmath161 overdensities ( e.g. , figure  4 in clarke & bromm 2003 ) .",
    "this provides us with the typical halo mass , @xmath162 , at a given redshift . in the @xmath161 case ,",
    "halo masses become less than @xmath163 at redshift @xmath164 .",
    "since this has dropped below the threshold mass for h@xmath165 cooling ( e.g. , yoshida et al . 2003 ) , pop  iii stars could not form in such low - mass halos . for higher - sigma peaks ,",
    "however , super - critical halos still exist at earlier times .",
    "therefore , for simplicity we adopt @xmath166 at @xmath164 .",
    "after the characteristic halo mass is thus determined , the virial temperature is fixed as well , and the ratio @xmath167 is known .",
    "the shu solution then gives the circumburst densities at a given redshift ( see section  2 ) , and grb afterglow spectra can finally be calculated .",
    "figure  [ fluxz ] shows the observed peak flux at observed time @xmath153 minutes , 1 hour and 1 day at @xmath168 .",
    "the peak flux varies from milli - jansky to sub - jansky .",
    "figure [ lambdaz ] gives the observational peak wavelength at the same observed times for the same redshift range .",
    "the observed peak wavelengths vary from millimeter to mid - infrared bands .",
    "early afterglows are best observed with facilities such as the _ jwst _ , or possibly adaptive - optics supported next - generation , extremely - large telescopes on the ground . at late times , radio facilities provide the optimal chance for detection",
    ". among them is alma , which will allow to probe the afterglow in the mm and sub - mm regime , where the peak of the emission is located about 1  day after the explosion for @xmath169 sources .",
    "as we have seen above , pop  iii grbs can in principle be detected out to very high redshifts .",
    "their afterglow spectra provide us with a unique probe into the state of the early igm , including its degree of ionization ( e.g. , totani et al .",
    "2006 ) and metal enrichment .",
    "the latter will be encoded in absorption lines imprinted on the smooth afterglow emission with a signature that depends on the nature of the pop  iii sne . here",
    ", we will consider for simplicity that prior to the grb only one nearby sn exploded beforehand , dispersing its complement of heavy elements into the otherwise pristine igm .",
    "such a scenario is consistent with the clustered nature of pop  iii star formation , as is expected for the high-@xmath170 peak host systems ( e.g. , greif & bromm 2006 ) .",
    "specifically , we here explore nucleosynthetic yields for type  ii core - collapse sne , and for pair - instability supernovae ( pisne ) . in table  1",
    ", we summarize the average yields per sn , @xmath171 , for select elements that are expected to dominate the spectral signature . for type  ii sne",
    ", we use the yields of woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) .",
    "these depend on the explosion energy , which introduces uncertainties of @xmath172 . for the pisn scenario",
    ", we utilize the yields of heger & woosley ( 2002 ; 2010 ) .",
    "table  1 also lists the properties of several key transitions , including their rest - frame wavelength , @xmath173 , and their oscillator strength , @xmath174 .",
    "we employ a simple model for the ionization structure of the metal - enriched gas .",
    "if the hydrogen in this region is substantially neutral , metals will reside in states typical of regions in the milky way ( , , , and for the elements of interest ) , because photons able to further ionize these elements will be absorbed by ( furlanetto & loeb 2003 ) .",
    "the ionization potential of is @xmath175 ev , and it remains locked in charge exchange equilibrium with ( oh 2002 ) . a modest extragalactic radiation background at frequencies below the lyman limit",
    "could easily maintain these metals in a singly - ionized state ( e.g. , furlanetto & loeb 2003 ) .",
    "we thus assume that c , o , si , and fe are predominantly in the ionization states typical for galactic clouds .      employing comoving coordinates ,",
    "the equation of cosmological radiative transfer is ( e.g. , abel et al . 1999 ) : @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the intensity of the radiation field , @xmath178 a unit vector along the direction of the ray , @xmath179 the hubble constant , and @xmath180 the ratio of cosmic scale factors separated by @xmath181 . here",
    "@xmath182 and @xmath183 denote the emission and absorption coefficient , respectively .",
    "equation  ( [ equ : crt ] ) can be simplified if the effects of cosmic expansion are negligible",
    ". this will be the case if the light - crossing time , @xmath184 , over the region of interest , here the ( physical ) size of our simulation box , @xmath185 , is small compared to the hubble time , @xmath186yr@xmath187^{-3/2}$ ] . since @xmath188 , the transfer equation reverts to its non - cosmological form : @xmath189 we further neglect any diffuse ( re-)emission of radiation , such that @xmath190 , and assume near steady - state conditions ( @xmath191 ) , resulting in the static transfer equation : @xmath192 if @xmath193 is the intensity of the central afterglow , approximately treated as a point source , we have the standard solution : @xmath194 , where @xmath195 is the optical depth along the line - of - sight ( los ) .    we can obtain the optical depth as follows . for a ( physical ) differential distance element , @xmath196 , along the given los , we have : @xmath197 , where @xmath198 is the frequency dependent absorption cross - section , and @xmath199 the number density of species x ( e.g. , , , , , ) .",
    "in the above equation , @xmath200 is the doppler width with parameter @xmath201 .",
    "the voigt function , @xmath202 , is given by @xmath203 here , the relative strength of natural ( damping ) to doppler broadening is described by the parameter @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the damping constant for transition @xmath206 ( morton & smith 1973 ) .",
    "the variables @xmath207 and @xmath208 are the frequency difference relative to the line center in doppler units , and the normalized particle velocity , with respect to the grb location , respectively .",
    "the total los value of the optical depth is then : @xmath209 .",
    "we note that we can neglect any wavelength differences between the grb source and the metal absorber , because of the very small expansion - generated redshift on the scale of our simulation box .",

    ", therefore , spectroscopy of pop  iii grb afterglows will be able to distinguish between different enrichment events , pisn vs. core - collapse .",
    "there is , however , a possible complication",
    ". the total enrichment level would be rather similar to that from one pisn for the case of 10 type  ii sne .",
    "such a situation is not implausible , given the number of pop  iii star formation sites , i.e. , minihalos , in the vicinity of the pop  iii grb ( see sec .",
    "however , we could then still discriminate between the cases using absorption line flux ratios , which remain quite different .    in table  2 , we list ranges for select flux ratios , as encountered along different loss .",

    ", there is an order of magnitude difference between the two imfs , allowing a robust identification . at later times , however , this clear - cut signature disappears again . in figure",
    "[ linesta ] , we show the cumulative ew distribution for 100 randomly selected sightlines at redshift @xmath94 . again , the resulting distributions are quite different for the two imf cases .",
    "it is , however , important to note that the statistical significance of this analysis is limited by the fact that it is based on only one simulation , and only one grb afterglow . in reality",
    ", observations will sample multiple explosion sites with respective los distributions that sample many clouds at various evolutionary stages along the way .",
    "our analysis should still provide a representative view of the typical situation , whereas a more complete study has to await the further increase in available computational power .",
    "in this paper , we develop a diagnostic to study pre - galactic metal enrichment in the vicinity of the first galaxies . specifically , we utilize the bright afterglow of a pop  iii grb as a featureless background source , and calculate the strength of metal absorption lines that are imprinted by the first heavy elements produced by pop  iii sne .",
    "to approximately derive the metal absorption line statistics , we use an existing highly - resolved simulation of the formation of a first galaxy which is characterized by the onset of atomic hydrogen cooling in a halo with virial temperature @xmath0k .",
    "the reverse shock initially dominates the afterglow flux a few hours after explosion , followed by the forward shock emission later on .",
    "the fluxes in the near - ir and radio bands may be detectable with the _ jwst _ and the vla out to @xmath225 .",
    "we predict that the afterglow emission peaks from near - ir to millimeter bands with peak fluxes from mjy to jy at different observed times .",
    "metal absorption lines in the grb afterglow spectrum , giving rise to ews of a few tens of  , may allow us to distinguish whether the first heavy elements were produced in a pop  iii star that died as a pisn , or a core - collapse sn .",
    "to this extent , the spectrum needs to be obtained sufficiently early , within the first few hours after the trigger .",
    "the absorption signature of the first sn events might allow us to constrain the underlying mass scale of pop  iii stars .",
    "this is the key input parameter to predict their evolution , nucleosynthetic yields , and modes of death , which in turn determine how the first stars impact subsequent cosmic history .",
    "the strength of the associated stellar feedback governs the assembly process of the first galaxies , in the sense that the stronger feedback from more massive stars shifts their formation to later stages in the hierarchical build - up of structure ( e.g. , ricotti et al .",
    "2002 ; greif et al . 2010 ; frebel & bromm 2012 ; ritter et al . 2012 ; wise et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "it will , however , be very challenging to directly probe the initial epoch of cosmic star formation .",
    "the reason is that even the _ jwst _ will not be able to detect individual first stars , but instead only more massive stellar systems or clusters that form later on in more massive host systems ( e.g. , pawlik et al .",
    "pop  iii grbs may thus afford us one of the few direct windows into the crucial epoch of first light , another one being the extremely energetic pair - instability sn or hypernova explosions that are predicted to end the lives of the most massive pop  iii stars ( e.g. , pan et al .",

    "<S> we explore high - redshift gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) as promising tools to probe pre - galactic metal enrichment . </S>",
    "<S> we utilize the bright afterglow of a population  iii ( pop iii ) grb exploding in a primordial dwarf galaxy as a luminous background source , and calculate the strength of metal absorption lines that are imprinted by the first heavy elements in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . to derive the grb absorption line diagnostics , we use an existing highly - resolved simulation of the formation of a first galaxy which is characterized by the onset of atomic hydrogen cooling in a halo with virial temperature @xmath0k . we explore the unusual circumburst environment inside the systems that hosted pop  iii stars , modeling the density evolution with the self - similar solution for a champagne flow . for minihalos close to the cooling threshold , </S>",
    "<S> the circumburst density is roughly proportional to @xmath1 with values of about a few @xmath2 . in more massive halos , corresponding to the first galaxies , </S>",
    "<S> the density may be larger , @xmath3@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting afterglow fluxes are weakly dependent on redshift at a fixed observed time , and may be detectable with the _ james webb space telescope ( jwst ) _ and very large array ( vla ) in the near - ir and radio wavebands , respectively , out to redshift @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that the maximum of the afterglow emission shifts from near - ir to millimeter bands with peak fluxes from mjy to jy at different observed times . </S>",
    "<S> the metal absorption line signature is expected to be detectable in the near future . </S>",
    "<S> grbs are ideal tools for probing the metal enrichment in the early igm , due to their high luminosities and featureless power - law spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the metals in the first galaxies produced by the first supernova ( sn ) explosions are likely to reside in low - ionization stages ( , , and ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if the afterglow can be observed sufficiently early , analysis of the metal lines may distinguish whether the first heavy elements were produced in a pair - instability supernova ( pisn ) , or a core - collapse ( type  ii ) sn , thus constraining the initial mass function of the first stars . </S>"
