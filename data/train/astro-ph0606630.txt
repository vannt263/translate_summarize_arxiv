    "the search for very high energy ( vhe , defined as @xmath4  gev ) @xmath0-ray emission from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is one of the major goals for ground - based @xmath0-ray astronomy .",
    "new detections open the possibility of a phenomenological study of the physics inside the relativistic jets in agns , in particular , to understand both the origin of the vhe @xmath0-rays as well as the correlations between photons of different energy ranges ( from radio to vhe ) .",
    "the number of reported vhe @xmath0-ray  emitting agns has been slowly increasing and is currently 12 ( 2006 june ) .",
    "six of them have been seen by magic : mrk  421 @xcite , mrk  501 @xcite , 1es1959 + 650 @xcite , 1es2344 + 514 @xcite , 1es1218 + 304 @xcite , and pg1553 + 113 @xcite .",

    "correlations between x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission have been found ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although the relationship has proven to be rather complicated , with @xmath0-ray flares also being detected in the absence of x - ray flares @xcite and vice versa @xcite .",
    "the optical - tev correlation has yet to be studied , but the optical - gev correlations seen in 3c  279 @xcite suggest that at least in some sources , such correlations exist . using this as a guideline , the magic collaboration has been performing target of opportunity observations whenever alerted that sources were in a high flux state in the optical and/or x - ray band .",
    "the agn mrk  180 ( 1es 1133 + 704 ) is a well - known high - frequency  peaked bl lac ( hbl ) object at a redshift of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of hbl objects exhibits a generic two - bump structure : one peak with a maximum in the x - ray band and the other peak located in the gev - tev band .",
    "the radiation is produced in a highly beamed plasma jet , which is almost aligned with the observer s line of sight .",
    "a double - peaked sed is normally attributed to a population of relativistic electrons , where one peak is due to synchrotron emission in the magnetic field of the jet and where the second peak is caused by inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of low - energy photons .",
    "the low - energy photons can be external to the jet ( external compton scattering ; @xcite ) or are produced within the jet via synchrotron radiation ( synchrotron self - compton [ ssc ] scattering ; @xcite ) .",

    "all of the up to now known agns with strong gev / tev @xmath0-emission belong to the hbl object class .    in many cases ,",
    "the second peak of the sed is not observable because of low sensitivity above a few times 100  mev of satellite - borne detectors and a too high energy threshold of ground - based @xmath0-ray detectors . in case of mrk  180 ,",

    "we estimate the systematic errors to be around 50% for the absolute flux level and 0.2 for the spectral index .",
    "the large systematic flux error is a consequence of the steep slope .",

    "in this letter we have presented the first detection of vhe @xmath0-ray emission from mrk  180 .",
    "the discovery was triggered by an optical flare , but no significant variations in the vhe regime were found .",
    "the short observation period and the small signal prevent us from carrying out detailed studies .",
    "it is therefore impossible to judge whether the detected vhe flux level represents a flaring or a quiescent state of the agn .",

    "a more detailed ssc model from @xcite ( _ solid line _ ) seems to describe the data more closely .",

    "the overall ic luminosity , however , is underestimated in this model : the observed integral flux above 300  gev is a factor 30 larger than predicted .",
