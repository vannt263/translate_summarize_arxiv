    "historically , the slavnov - taylor ( st ) identities @xcite have played an essential role in proving the renormalizability of non - abelian gauge theories @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to know the limitations or even the validity of these identities whenever new structures as algebra deformations and space noncommutativity are introduced .",
    "nowadays , this issue has aroused a deal of attention particularly due to results that seem to indicate that at the planck s scale the space may become noncommutative @xcite .",
    "in this situation the coordinates should satisfy @xmath4=i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu},\\ ] ] where for the most studied case , called canonical noncommutativity , @xmath5 is a constant , antisymmetric matrix . in general terms ,",
    "the unleashing of noncommutativity signals not only for the breaking of lorentz invariance but also leads to the appearance of an ultraviolet metamorphosis , the so called ir / uv mixing , which may destroy the perturbative scheme @xcite . besides these basic aspects the possible modifications of results linked to standard symmetries must also be investigated .",
    "it has been proved , for example , that cpt symmetry is preserved by the noncommutativity , in spite of its strong nonlocality @xcite .",
    "gauge symmetry seems also to be important to secure the presence of goldstone bosons for spontaneously broken symmetries @xcite . concerning the st identities , exploratory studies have been dedicated to the effects of the noncommutativity on the renormalization of the qed@xmath6 @xcite and also specific scattering processes in the tree approximation @xcite .",
    "these studies were complemented by a systematic analysis at the one loop level for qed@xmath6 in ref .",
    "such studies are relevant particularly taking into account the incoming lhc experiments to test possible extensions of the standard model .",
    "going further with these investigations , in this work we shall analyze the possible modifications on the st identities due to the noncommutativity of the underlying space in the context of the three dimensional cp@xmath7 model . when compared with qed@xmath6 ,",
    "the new feature in this model is the absence of a kinetic term for the gauge field , which however is generated by quantum corrections .",
    "this study is also a natural sequel of an earlier work on the noncommutative cp@xmath7 model in which , up to the leading order of @xmath3 , the absence of dangerous uv / ir mixing was proved @xcite .",

    "notice that , as indicated in the last line of ( [ eq3 ] ) , we are adopting a generic lorentz gauge fixing whereas the calculations performed in @xcite were restricted to the landau gauge . our gauge fixing together with the term for the ghost fields @xmath21 and @xmath24 signalize a formal symmetry associated with the invariance of the action under brst transformations which have the following form    [ eq4 ] @xmath25 a_{\\mu } & \\rightarrow & a_{\\mu}^{\\prime}=a_{\\mu}-\\frac{1}{e}\\,\\partial_{\\mu}c\\,\\epsilon+i[c , a_{\\mu}]_{\\star } \\,\\epsilon~,\\\\[5pt ] \\lambda & \\rightarrow & \\lambda'=\\lambda+i[c,\\lambda]_{\\star } \\,\\epsilon~,\\\\ c & \\rightarrow & c^{\\prime}=c - ic\\star c\\,\\epsilon~,\\\\[5pt ] \\bar{c } & \\rightarrow & \\bar{c}^{\\prime}=\\bar{c}-\\frac{1}{e\\alpha}\\,\\partial^{\\mu}a_{\\mu}\\,\\epsilon~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 is an infinitesimal grassmannian parameter . due to the presence of the moyal product , the implications of this invariance have to be examined anew .",
    "in particular we shall inspect the st identities characteristics of this invariance but , as the leading contributions in @xmath0 involve both the one - loop and two - loop diagrams whose analytic expressions are very intricate , we will focus directly on the asymptotic behavior for high momenta of the relevant green functions .    to derive the st identities , as usual , we add to the source terms for the basic fields the source terms associated to the brst transformations @xmath27_{\\star } ) \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\!\\!k_{\\mu}\\star \\big(-\\frac{1}{e}\\,\\partial^{\\mu}c+i[c , a^{\\mu}]_{\\star } \\big)+v\\star ( -ic\\star c)+\\omega^{\\dagger}_a\\star ( ic\\star \\phi_a ) + ( -i\\phi^{\\dagger}_a\\star c)\\star \\omega_a\\bigg{\\}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the invariance of the functional generator under the field transformations ( [ eq4 ] ) formally allows for the st identity @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the functional generator for the connected green functions .",

    "we begin the analysis of the above identities by proving that the longitudinal part of the gauge field propagator is not modified by radiative corrections , as it happens in @xcite .",
    "in fact , by functionally deriving ( [ eq7 ] ) with respect to the @xmath33 and @xmath34 sources , we get @xmath35 where henceforth a vertical bar is used just to remember that the function immediately to its left must be calculated with all sources equal to zero .",

    "we have verified that the @xmath74 functions are not uv divergent , therefore no counterterms are needed . however , as shown in @xcite , @xmath75 consists of divergent diagrams with one and two loops . in the two loop case ,",

    "less trivial result is obtained when we analyze the subleading order which receives loop corrections .",
    "as we will see , the identity in subleading order carries quantum corrections and establish a relation among the renormalization constants .",

    "furthermore , we obtain the relation involving the renormalization constants , @xmath88 .",
    "we have verified the st identity in the @xmath3 expansion for the noncommutative cp@xmath7 model .",
    "as is known , the diagrams of @xmath3 order involve one and two loops which are very intricate .",
    "therefore , we restricted ourselves to the verification of the matching of the uv divergent parts .",
    "besides these uv parts , we have also infrared ( ir ) singular parts coming from nonplanar parts of the functions .",
    "however , in @xcite it was shown that the leading ir singular parts are canceled due to diagramatic identities , leaving only logarithmic singularities , which are not problematic as they are integrable .",
