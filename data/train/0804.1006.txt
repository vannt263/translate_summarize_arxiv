    "asteroseismology provides a promising avenue to determine stellar masses.among the sdbs two classes of multi - mode pulsators are known , the v361  hya and v1093 her stars .",
    "the v361 hya ones are of short period ( 28min ) , while the v1093 her stars have longer periods ( 45 to 120min ) .",
    "the short period oscillations can be explained as acoustic modes ( @xmath2-modes ) of low degree @xmath3 and low radial order @xmath4 excited by an opacity bump due to a local enhancement of iron - group elements ( charpinet et al .",

    "they detected a very strong main mode together with about 20 other modes .",

    "the small @xmath9 implies that the star is quite evolved and has already left the extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) .",
    "radial velocity variations due to pulsation were detected for the first time by otoole et al .",
    "we organised a coordinated multi - site spectroscopic campaign to observe pg1605@xmath0072 with medium resolution spectrographs on 2 m and 4 m telescopes .",
    "during the multi - site spectroscopic telescope ( msst ) campaign , we obtained 151 hours of time - resolved spectroscopy on pg1605 + 072 at four observatories in may / june 2002 ( otoole et al .",
    "2005 , henceforth paper  i ) .",
    "the spectra obtained at steward observatory outnumber the data from the other observatories and are of much better s / n than the rest of the data sets .",

    "it is evident that all the observed h , he  i  and o ii  lines vary in the same way with phase .",
    "effective temperatures ( @xmath12 ) , surface gravities ( @xmath9 ) , and helium abundances ( @xmath13 ) were determined for every bin by fitting synthetic model spectra to all hydrogen and helium lines simultaneously , using a procedure developed by napiwotzki et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . a grid of metal line - blanketed lte model atmospheres with solar metal abundance was used .",
    "we start our analysis with the dominant mode in radial velocity , which is expected to also show the largest variation in temperature and gravity ( see fig .",

    "the variations of @xmath12 and @xmath9 are sinusoidal .",

    "this correction was applied to all of the @xmath18 individual spectra by subtracting the cleaning function for the corresponding phase of the dominant mode .",
    "all individual cleaned spectra were then summed into the appropriate phase bin for the corresponding periods of lower amplitude frequencies ( from @xmath19 onwards ) and were analysed for the atmospheric parameter variations as described above .",

    "is detected only marginally , whereas the gravity variation is pronounced ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_weakmodes ] and table  1 ) . in order to characterise pulsation modes ,",
    "it is also important to investigate the phase lags between temperature , gravity and radial velocity variations .",
    "these phase lags can be used to determine the deviations from an adiabatic change of condition .",
    "the radial velocities of individual spectra were taken from paper i.    the amplitudes of their variations were determined in the same way as the temperature and gravity variations using the phase binning and cleaning technique described in sect .  2 .",
    "phase lags between the variation of radial velocity and the atmospheric parameters can be derived directly by comparing the phases of their maxima . in order to determine the phase lags of the weaker modes",
    ", we used the temperature curves , and measured just the phase lags for two sine functions .",
    "as the formal fitting errors are unrealistically small , we use half the bin size ( @xmath34 ) as error estimate .",
    "it is worth noting that for all recovered modes ( except @xmath21 ) , the radial velocity variation reaches its maximum before the temperature variation .",

    "after that , we consider the phase lags between the radial velocity and the gravity , which are supposed to have a strict relationship , as they are both produced by the movement of the stellar surface ( i.e.  the @xmath11 variation should be in line with the derivative of the radial velocity curve ) .",

    "for the modelling we used a routine , authored and introduced by townsend ( 1997 ) . the adiabatic code _",
    "bruce _ has been developed to model non - radial pulsations for early - type main sequence stars . with a radiative shell and a convective core these stars have a similar structure as subdwarf b stars .",
    "therefore the routines should also be able to describe the pulsations in these smaller sdb stars . in order to model the surface variations by a certain pulsation mode",
    ", the stellar parameters have to be known accurately , e.g.  the polar values for radius , temperature , gravity and inclination as well as the equatorial rotation velocity . from these assumptions",
    "an equilibrium surface grid of the star , consisting of 51030 points , is calculated , taking into account any effects of the rotation on both surface geometry and surface temperature distribution .",
    "thereafter this grid is perturbed by one ( or several ) well defined pulsation mode(s ) to reveal the temporal propagation .",
    "the perturbation must be characterized through degree and order of a spherical harmonic and a perturbation velocity amplitude ( for more details see townsend 1997 ) .",
    "the inclination angle plays a very important role for cancellation effects except for radial modes .",
    "_ bruce _ provides us with all the parameters neccessary for a spectral synthesis such as temperature , gravity and the projected values for velocity , surface area and surface normal for every point grid point on the stellar surface .",
    "the _ kyle _",
    "routine is based on a code authored by falter ( 2001 ) and used to perform the spectral synthesis for every time step . for this purpose",
    "it interpolates in the same grid of lte synthetic model spectra used for the spectral analysis ( see sect .  2 ) to obtain a spectrum for every point on the stellar surface . in order to shorten the calculation time ,",
    "our model atmosphere grid was restricted to nine points , i.e. @xmath45k , @xmath46k and @xmath47k in temperature and @xmath9 of @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the synthetic spectra cover @xmath51 to @xmath52 at a resolution of @xmath53 .      falter ( 2001 ) used a simple wavelength independent limb darkening law in his code , which is the main drawback of this method according to townsend ( 1997 ) .",
    "so this approximation was regarded too crude and replaced by a quadratic law calculated for every wavelength of the synthetic spectra .",
    "intensity spectra for nine angels were calculated from the model atmosphere and quadratic functions were fitted for every wavelength .",
    "the set of limb darkening coefficients was then input to _",
    "kyle_. fig .",
    "[ fig_model ] ( _ top _ ) shows the theoretical line profile variation for a radial mode @xmath54 in pg1605@xmath0072 calculated with the _ bruce _ and _ kyle _ code .",
    "we then used the same fitting procedure described in sect .  2 to determine atmospheric parameters .",
    "to complete the set of stellar parameters we need to know the equatorial rotational velocity .",
    "heber et al .  ( 1999 ) determined the projected rotational velocity to @xmath55 from the observed spectral line broadening in a time integrated spectrum .",
    "however pulsational line broadening was not considered .",
    "as the rv amplitude of the dominant mode is large , it has to be corrected for .",
    "taking into account the projection factor ( montanes  rodriguez et al.2001 ) , we adopt a lower limit for the @xmath56 of about @xmath57 .",
    "+ based on these assumptions we tried two different models for pg1605 + 072 : model i is a slowly rotating star with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , model ii is a fast rotating one with @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in the following section",
    "we compare the surface variations of these very different models .",

    "this shows the reliability of our procedure . as can be seen from a comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig_f1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_model ] , the predicted variations for @xmath12 are much larger than observed for the dominant mode , while that of the first harmonic are consistent with the observed ones .",
    "the predicted gravity variations however are consistent with observations for both the dominant and the first harmonic . in their analysis of balloon 090100001",
    "stensen et al .",
    "( these proceedings ) showed that the temperature variations may be strongly affected by non - adiabatic effects , while the gravity and velocity variations are not .",
    "if we therefore rely only on the gravity variations we could conclude that the dominant frequency is the radial mode .    for the @xmath63 modes in the slowly rotating model i we do not see a node line any more and",
    "therefore the pattern is similar to a weak radial mode again .",
    "but now as we change sign on @xmath64 , the sinusoidal variation shifts with a factor of @xmath65 in phase ( see fig  [ fig_l1m+-1 ] ) .",
    "the amplitudes in the slow rotating model for @xmath66 are 1714k in @xmath12 and 0.057 in @xmath9 , while for @xmath62 they are 1840k in @xmath12 and 0.073 in @xmath9 .",
    "our result is that in a slowly rotating model the prograde and retrograde pulsation modes look quite the same , in terms of sinusoidal variation , except for a phase shift of @xmath65 .    in the fast rotating model",
    "ii we view the star almost pole on , therefore we see the node line , which divides the star into 2 areas of different size . either the hot part or the cold part of the star prevails and we obtain again a sinusoidal shape of the variations with a rather low amplitude .",
    "our modelling shows that this is true only for the temperature variations .",
    "for @xmath62 we measure amplitudes of 290k in @xmath12 and 0.017 in @xmath9 , while for @xmath66 the variations are 175k in @xmath12 and 0.001 in @xmath9 .",
    "hence , for a retrograde mode the gravity variation almost disappears , while for the prograde mode it does not . applying this method we derived a complete set of amplitudes for the modes @xmath67 ( tillich et al .",
