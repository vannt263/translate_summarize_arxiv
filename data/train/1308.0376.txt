    "in recent years , three dimensional ( 3d ) displays using computer - generated holograms ( cghs ) have been well studied , since cghs can faithfully reconstruct the light waves of 3d images @xcite .",
    "such 3d display is referred as to `` electroholography '' .",
    "electroholography can reconstruct 3d images by displaying cghs generated by diffraction calculations on a spatial light modulator ( slm ) such as amplitude or phase - modulated lcd panels . in electroholography ,",
    "several important issues must be considered : calculation cost for cgh , narrow viewing angle , small reconstructed images and color reconstruction .    as color reconstruction is an important issues ,",
    "many color reconstruction methods have been studied .",
    "for instance , color reconstruction methods using three slms to display three cghs corresponding to the red , green and blue components of a 3d image have been proposed @xcite .",
    "color reconstruction methods using a single slm have also been proposed : space - division @xcite and depth - division @xcite methods .",
    "another single slm method is the time - division method , which temporally switches rgb lights by synchronizing signals @xcite .",
    "regardless of the color reconstruction methods as mentioned above , we need to compute three diffraction calculations corresponding to the rgb components of a color image .",
    "we developed a calculation reduction method for color cghs using color space conversion .",
    "color cghs have been calculated on rgb space . in this paper",
    ", we calculate color cghs in other color spaces : for example , ycbcr color space , which is widely used in digital image processing like jpeg and mpeg formats . in ycbcr color space , a rgb image is converted to the luminance component ( y ) , blue - difference chroma ( cb ) and red - difference chroma ( cr ) components . in terms of the human eye , although the negligible difference of the luminance component is well - recognized , the difference of the other components is not . in this method ,",
    "the luminance component is normal sampled and the chroma components are down - sampled .",
    "the down - sampling allows us to accelerate the calculation of the color cghs .",
    "we calculate diffraction from the components , and then convert the diffracted result in ycbcr color space to rgb color space .    in section 2 ,",
    "we explain the calculation reduction method for color cgh using color space conversion . in section 3",
    ", we verify the proposed method on computer simulation .",
    "section 4 concludes this work .",
    "for simple notation we introduce diffraction operator @xmath0}}$ ] , where @xmath1 is the propagation distance , @xmath2 is the wavelength , @xmath3 is a source plane and @xmath4 is the position vector .",
    "for example , the angular spectrum method @xcite , which is a major diffraction calculation method , is expressed by the diffraction operator as follows : @xmath5 } }   = \\int { \\mathcal{f } \\biggl[u_1(\\bm x_1 ) \\biggl ] }   \\exp \\biggl ( 2 \\pi i z \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2 } - |\\bf f|^2 } ~ \\biggr )    \\exp(2\\pi i { \\bf f x_2 } ) d { \\bm f } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & { \\mathcal{f}^{-1 } \\biggl [ { \\mathcal{f } \\biggl[u_1(\\bm x_1 ) \\biggl ] }   \\exp \\biggl ( 2 \\pi i z \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2 } - |\\bf f|^2 } ~ \\biggr )   \\biggl ] } , \\label{eqn : fre}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the position vector in fourier domain , @xmath7 is a source plane , @xmath8 is a destination plane , @xmath9}$ ] is fourier transform , and @xmath1 is the propagation distance between the source and destination planes .",
    "if we calculate color cghs in rgb color space , we need to calculate three diffracted fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 from the corresponding components of the rgb images , @xmath12 and @xmath13 as follows : @xmath14 } } \\label{eqn : rgb_cgh1},\\\\ u_g(\\bm x_2)={{{\\rm d}^{z}_{\\lambda_g } [ g(\\bm x_1 ) ] } } \\label{eqn : rgb_cgh2},\\\\ u_b(\\bm x_2)={{{\\rm d}^{z}_{\\lambda_b } [ b(\\bm x_1 ) ] } } \\label{eqn : rgb_cgh3},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the wavelengths of rgb lights , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we call this the `` direct color cgh calculation '' .",
    "if there are spatial light modulators that are capable of displaying complex amplitudes @xcite , we can reconstruct a clear rgb image without direct and conjugated lights from eqs.([eqn : rgb_cgh1])-([eqn : rgb_cgh3 ] ) by the three slm method @xcite , time - division method @xcite and space - division method @xcite and so forth . when using the amplitude or phase - modulated slms , we need to convert the complex amplitudes of eqs.([eqn : rgb_cgh1])-([eqn : rgb_cgh3 ] ) to the amplitude cghs by taking the real part or phase - only cgh by taking the argument .    from here ,",
