    "for the last ten years , the mathematical formalism of quantum theory has been actively applied outside the domain of quantum physics .",
    "we have seen numerous applications in decision making ( both in cognitive and social science ) , economics and also finance .",
    "see for instance acacio de barros and suppes ( 2009 ) @xcite , asano et al .",

    "recently the _ quantum - like _ ( ql ) approach started to be explored in political science .",
    "some of the ql features of the * *  * * behavior of voters in the us political system were discussed in zorn and smith ( 2011 ) @xcite .",
    "the authors start with a * *  * * comparison of the notions of state separability in conventional models of party governance and in quantum information theory ( see * *  * * zorn and smith ( 2011 ) @xcite ) and they then show that the ql model might provide a more adequate description of the voters state space  ` mental space ' .",
    "the authors present a strong motivation of the usage of the complex hilbert space as the voters ` mental space . '    in this paper we present a ql - model describing the dynamics of the voters state ( as represented in the complex hilbert space ) .",
    "first , we consider what we could call * *  * * ` a free ql - dynamics ' , when a voter is not under the pressure of mass media and the social environment . by applying the quantum approach",
    "we describe the dynamics of her state by using an analogue of the schrdinger equation .",
    "a simple mathematical analysis implies that alice s preferences encoded in her state - vector ( ` mental wave function ' ) fluctuate _ without _ stabilization to the definite state .",
    "hence , such a dynamics can describe the unstable part of the electorate : those voters who have no firm preferences . in quantum physics , stabilization and damping of fluctuations",
    "is a typical consequence of interaction with the environment .",
    "we apply this approach to the problem of the stabilization of fluctuations of voters preferences .",
    "an essential part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of the applicability of quantum dynamics to a social system ( e.g. a voter ) which is coupled to the social environment .",
    "the main problem is that the exact quantum dynamics of a system coupled to the physical environment is extremely complicated .",
    "therefore , to simplify matters , typically a quantum markov approximation is applied .",
    "this approximation is applicable under a number of non - trivial conditions ( see ingarden et al .",
    "( 1997 ) @xcite ) .",
    "our aim is to translate these conditions into the language of social science and to analyze their applicability to the dynamics of voters preferences . in this connection",
    "the quantum markovian dynamics , especially via the quantum master equation , can model ( approximately ) voters preference dynamics .",
    "our approach is based on the quantum master equation which describes the interaction of a social system with a ` social bath ' .",
    "we use a very general framework which can be applied to a variety of problems in politics , social science , economics , and finance .",
    "the main problem of any concrete application is to analyze the conditions of applicability of the quantum master equation ( the quantum markov approximation ) to the corresponding problem in decision making .",
    "we remark that the work of fiorina ( 1996 ) @xcite played an important role in the motivation of the quantum model based on the use of entangled quantum states ( see zorn and smith ( 2011 ) @xcite for the two institutional choices in u.s .",
    "politics  the congress and the presidency ) .",
    "zorn and smith ( 2011 ) @xcite also present a detailed analysis of the inter - relation between classical and quantum models .",
    "such an analysis is very important to attract the interest of mainstream researchers in decision making to quantum models . for such researchers ,",
    "the applications of the quantum formalism to social science may on prima facie be considered as quite exotic .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we begin with an extended section in which we compare classical and quantum probabilistic approaches to decision making .",
    "our aim is not only to stress the differences , but also to find the commonalities .",
    "our findings argue for an important degree of similarity between quantum and subadditive probabilistic descriptions of decision making .",
    "we also emphasize the vital role of contextuality .",
    "one of the basic tools of probabilistic investigations in psychology , cognitive science , economics and finance is bayesian analysis ( see * *  * * de finetti ( 1972 ) @xcite and kreps ( 1988 ) @xcite ) which allows for a process of mental updating of probabilities ( objective or subjective depending on the interpretation ) on the basis of newly collected statistical data .",
    "bayesian probability can be distinguished to be objective ( independent of the individual who makes a decision ) or subjective , that is to say , related to the * *  * * personal belief of an individual ( see * *  * * de finetti ( 1974 ) @xcite ) .",
    "the objective probabilities represent the choice that rational agents should make in the light of an objective situation and updating occurs as a consequence of the appearance of any new event ( see chalmers ( 1999 ) @xcite ) . by this approach",
    "the agents are supposed to distribute the prior probabilities equally on the basis of some principle of indifference . in particular",
    ", the bayesian approach plays an important role in classical decision making ( see de finetti ( 1972 ) @xcite ) .",
    "we stress that this method is a part of conventional ( ` classical ' ) probability theory based on kolmogorov s axiomatics ( 1950 ) @xcite . the bayes formula for conditional probabilities is:@xmath0 where @xmath1 the law of total probability forms an integral part of the classical bayesian approach .",
    "let us consider the law of total probability in the simplest situation .",
    "consider an event @xmath2 and its complement @xmath3 and assume that the probabilities of both these events are positive .",
    "then , for any event @xmath4 the following formula ( of total probability ) holds : @xmath5 we note that for _ quantum probabilities _ , the law of total probability is violated ! in general , the difference between the left - hand and right - hand sides of ( 2 ) is nonzero .",
    "this difference is nothing else than the influence of the interference term , which plays a fundamental role in quantum theory ( as well as in classical physical wave theories ) .",
    "the quantum analog of the law of total probability has the form : @xmath6 depending on the sign of @xmath7 one observes constructive ( @xmath8 or destructive ( @xmath9 interference . in the first case",
    "the probability to observe some phenomenon increases so much that it can not be explained by the laws of classical probability theory . in the second case one",
    "similarly finds a ` mystical ' decreasing of probability ( e.g. , probabilities @xmath10 can result in a zero probability , @xmath11 in the case @xmath12 the quantum formula of total probability ( the formula containing thus an interference of probabilities ) is reduced to the classical law of total probability .",
    "this is a very important point of transition from usage of the classical probabilistic model to the quantum probabilistic model .    by decreasing the absolute value of interference coefficient , the latter",
    "can be transformed into the former ( as the coefficient vanishes ) .",
    "thus the quantum probabilistic models in cognitive science , psychology , and social science are natural extensions of the classical models .",
    "if the deviation of the left - hand side of equation ( 3 ) from the right - hand side is relatively small , we can ignore the interference contribution and proceed with the classical law of total probability .    in summary",
    ", we can think of the quantum approach of decision making as a natural generalization of the bayesian approach which is based on the transition from the classical formula of total probability to its quantum analogue .",
    "the following questions naturally arise when considering the use of equation ( 3 ) as a new tool in decision making :    1 .",
    "is the departure from equation ( 2 ) to equation ( 3 ) a totally new step in the development of probabilistic modeling in social science ? 2 .",
    "are there other conventional social models based on departures from the laws of classical probability ?",
    "surprisingly for those who argue for the exceptional novelty of the quantum approach to social problems , the answer is ` yes ' . in mainstream studies in cognitive science , psychology , behavioral economics and finance , non - classical probability has been actively used during many years .",
    "comparing the quantum approach with the traditional non - classical probabilistic approaches is not a straightforward task . in ql models",
    "the _ violation of the law of total probability _ is considered as the crucial point . however , the majority of traditional non - classical models are not based on the aforementioned violation of equation(2 ) , but rather on an * *  * * application of _ subadditive probabilities . _",
    "hence , the * *  * * _ violation of the law of additive probability _ has already been * *  * * actively discussed in social science .",
    "khrennikov and haven ( 2007 ) @xcite indicate ( p. 23 ) that * *  * * when experiment participants have to express their degree of beliefs on a [ 0 , 1 ] interval , probabilistic additivity will be violated in many cases and subadditivity obtains .",
    "see bearden et al .",
    "( 2005 ) @xcite for a good overview .",
    "khrennikov and haven ( 2007 ) @xcite continue as follows ( p. 23 - 24 ) : bearden et al .",
    "( 2005 ) @xcite also indicate that such subadditivity has been obtained with experiment participants belonging to various industry groups , such as option traders for instance ( fox et al .",
    "( 1996 ) @xcite ) .",
    "the key work pertaining to the issue of subadditivity in psychology is by * *  * * tversky and koehler ( 1994 ) @xcite and rottenstreich and tversky ( 1997 ) @xcite .",
    "their theory , also known under the name of ` support theory ' is in the words of tversky and koehler ( 1994 ) @xcite  ` ... a theory in which the judged probability of an event depends on the explicitness of its description . ' in other words , it is not the event which is important as such but its description . in tversky and koehler ( 1994 )",
    "@xcite the authors highlight the ` current state of affairs' ... on the various interpretations that subjective probability may have . amongst the interpretations",
    "is zadeh s ( 1978 ) @xcite possibility theory and the upper and lower probability approach of suppes ( 1974 ) @xcite .",
    "the paper of dubois and prade ( 1998 ) @xcite , also mentioned in tversky and koehler ( 1994 ) @xcite , provides for an excellent overview on non - additive probability approaches .     to couple ql models based on the violation of the law of total probability and bayesian probability , with traditional studies based on subadditive probabilities ,",
    "we need to recall that the mathematical derivation of the formula of total probability is based on the additivity of probability and the bayes formula for conditional probabilities .",
    "therefore there are two possible sources of violation of equation ( 2 ) : i ) subadditivity and ii ) the non - bayesian definition of conditional probability .",
    "both these sources exhibit themselves in ql - models .",
    "hence , the subadditivity of probability is an important common point of the ql and traditional ( based on non - classical probability ) approaches .",
    "moreover , many experts in quantum physics especially stress the role of subadditivity of quantum probability as the main source of quantum interference ( feynman and hibbs ( 1965 ) @xcite .",
    "the ql approach can be considered as a special mathematical model describing the usage of subadditive probability in social science .",
    "it is not clear whether any social science based model with subadditive probability can be embedded in the ql - approach .",
    "the quantum probabilities have a very special structure : they are based on complex probability amplitudes , vectors from a complex linear space and probability is obtained from a squared complex amplitude . _",
    "it is not clear whether any subadditive probability from the aforementioned social science based _ _ models can be represented in this way .",
    "_ nevertheless , even if it might imply the loss of generality , the use of the linear space representation simplifies the operation with probabilities .",
    "furthermore , it provides us with a possibility to use a powerful mathematical apparatus of quantum mechanics in an interdisciplinary way .    in this paper , we intend to explore quantum dynamical equations .",
    "we stress that the form of these equations depend very much on whether interaction with the environment is taken into account or neglected . here",
    "we are merely interested in the application of quantum dynamics to the modeling of the evolution of the mental state of a human being interacting with an extremely complex social environment .",
    "the complexity of the actual environment is so high that it strongly influences the decision making process of an individual , finally implying a resolution from superposition of his / her mental states .",
    "in quantum terms a decoherence takes place .      bayesian probability according to maher ( 2010 ) @xcite  ( p. 120 )",
    "explicates a kind of rationality we would like our choices to have ...  correspondingly , the ` absolute rational choice ' maher ( 2010 ) ( p.120 ) refers to , can be understood as the maximization of expected utility .",
    "the bayesian updating of probabilities and the validity of the law of total probability have a direct coupling with the problem of rationality in decision making .",
    "von neumann and morgenstern s ( 1944 ) @xcite expected utility theory , and savage s sure thing principle ( savage ( 1954 ) @xcite ) postulate a complete rationality ( i.e. a maximization of one s own payoff and the minimizing of one s own losses ) .",
    "savage ( 1954 ) @xcite ( p. 21 ) proposed the so called * *  * * sure thing principle ( stp) , denoting that : if a person would not prefer [ a decision ] @xmath13 to @xmath14 either knowing that the event @xmath2 obtained , or knowing that the event @xmath3 obtained , then he does not prefer @xmath13 to @xmath15 [ whether knowing or not if the event @xmath2 or @xmath3 happened ] .  savage ( 1954 ) @xcite * *  * * illustrate**s * * the validity of the principle with an example of a businessman , who considers whether to buy some property before the presidential elections or not .",
    "savage ( 1954 ) ( p. 21 ) describes the situation of a businessman who is uncertain if the republicans or democrats will win the election campaign .",
    "he decides that he would buy the property if the republicans win , but also he decides that he should buy the property * *  * * even if the democrats win . by taking the decision to buy in any case ( for example the decision @xmath15 ) ,",
    "it is natural to assume that the businessman will buy the property being uncertain of whether the republicans ( event @xmath16 or democrats will win ( event @xmath17 .",
    "the principle could be statistically represented with help of the formula of total probability ( equation ( 2 ) ) , where the events @xmath2 and @xmath3 are assigned some probability and the decision @xmath18 ( here depicted as @xmath14 to be consistent with savage s symbols ) would be a conditional probability of @xmath2 and @xmath19 so that the exact statistical probability for the possible decision @xmath15 could be obtained . in this illustration",
    "we see that the conditional probability of @xmath15 would be equal to one ( i.e. there is @xmath20 confidence about the purchase of a house ) . according to croson ( 1999 ) @xcite the event",
    "@xmath2 can be as well i ) * *  * * an exogenous risk : the uncertainty about the state of nature ( e.g. the property purchase ) as well as ii ) * *  * * a strategic risk : an uncertainty about the choice of a strategic opponent ( e.g. a competitor starts a price war ) .",
    "croson ( 1999 ) @xcite describes such a pattern of decision making as ` consequential reasoning ' , as the individual considers the consequences ( for instance the amount of the payoffs ) before considering a particular action .",
    "savage s sure thing principle has been regarded as a foundation axiom for decision making in economics .",
    "kreps ( 1998 ) @xcite ( p. 120 ) called savage s principle the crowning glory of choice theories .",
    "however , many experiments , such as allais ( 1953 ) @xcite , tversky and shafir ( 1992 ) @xcite , croson ( 1999 ) @xcite proved that economic decision makers in general tend to violate the savage sure thing principle and expected utility theory .",
    "for example , in a prisoner dilemma type game experiment , violation of the rationality postulate of savage s sure thing principle was found in experiments performed by tversky and shafir ( 1992 ) @xcite and later repeated by croson ( 1999 ) @xcite and busemeyer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) @xcite .",
    "traditionally , this game is played in three conditions . in the ` unknown ' condition the player acts without knowing the opponent s action . in the known ` defect condition ' , the player knows that the opponent has defected before he / she acted . in the known ` cooperate condition '",
    "the player knows that the * *  * * opponent has cooperated , before he / she acted .",
    "see also tversky and shafir ( 1992 ) @xcite and pothos and busemeyer ( 2009 ) @xcite .",
    "we cite tversky and shafir ( 1992 ) @xcite ( p. 309 ) the subjects ... played a series of prisoners dilemma games , without feedback , each against a different unknown opponent supposedly selected at random from among the participants . in this setup",
    "the rate of cooperation was 3% when subjects knew that the subject knew that the opponent has defected and 16% when they knew that the opponent has cooperated .",
    "however , when the subjects did not know whether their opponent had cooperated or defected ( as is normally the case of the game ) [ condition of uncertainty ] ) the rate of cooperation rose to 37% .",
    "this experiment showed that when the players are unaware of their opponents actions , they do not behave rationally as they are supposed to do in a conventional prisoners dilemma game .",
    "this anomaly in behavior occurred in other games of the prisoners dilemma type and also in hawaiian vacation experiments .",
    "the basic effect those experiments have in common is referred to by tversky and shafir ( 1992 ) @xcite and croson ( 1999 ) @xcite as the ` disjunction effect ' .",
    "busemeyer et al . ( 2006 ) @xcite show that the disjunction effect is equivalent to the * *  * * violation of the law of total probability .",
    "since this law is violated by ql models , all such models in social science exhibit the disjunction affect .      in the quantum community",
    "there is still no consensus on the basic roots of ` quantum mysteries ' ; in particular , the grounds for the violation of the laws of classical probability theory .",
    "one hundred years after the creation of quantum mechanics ( the 1920s-1930 s starting with the founders of quantum mechanics : bohr , heisenberg and einstein ) , the intensity of debates about its foundation have not abated .",
    "we may even claim the debates are more intense .",
    "one of the possible sources of the quantum mysteries is the notion of contextuality .",
    "the viewpoint that the results of quantum observations depend crucially on the measurement context was proposed by niels bohr , who emphasized that we are not able to approach the micro world ( with the aid of our measurement devices ) without bringing essential disturbances into its state .",
    "the quantum systems are too sensitive to the measurement apparata .",
    "the context of measurement plays an essential ( depending on the interpretation , even crucial ) role in forming the result of our measurement . according to the fundamental interpretation of quantum mechanics , the ` copenhagen interpretation '",
    ", quantum systems do not have objective properties which exist independently of ` questions ' asked to these systems in the context of measurement . says suppes ( 1974 ) @xcite ( p. 171 - 172 ) * : * any time we measure a microscopic object by using macroscopic apparatus we disturb the state of the microscopic object and , according to the fundamental ideas of quantum mechanics , we can not hope to improve the situation by using new methods of measurement that will lead to exact results of the classical sort for simultaneously measured conjugate variables .",
    "the contextual viewpoint is attributed to the origin of non - classical probabilistic behavior of quantum systems and is very attractive for those who already apply or aim to apply a quantum formalism in other domains outside physics .",
    "it is important to stress that the contextual interpretation of quantum mechanics is more ` innocent ' than other essentially more exotic viewpoints , such as the quantum non- locality concept or the ` many worlds ' interpretations .",
    "the majority of people working in cognitive science and psychology would not accept a possibility of non - local interactions between human beings , e.g. through a splitting of reality in many worlds .",
    "the concept of contextuality is a well known feature of cognitive systems .",
    "we also see the origin of non - bayesian ( ` irrational ' ) decision making in the contextuality of observations performed for mental quantities , including self - observations .",
    "hence , the value of the subjective probability does not exist independently of the measurement context , only whilst ` asking about someone s preferences ' including ourselves , we create them .",
    "for example , in semantics studies context is treated by representing it as cue words , or co- appearing words . this semantic contextuality ( well known and actively explored in traditional semantic models )",
    "was used as the starting point for the development of ql model**s * * of word recognition ( see bruza et al .",
    "( 2005 @xcite , 2009a @xcite , 2009b @xcite ) .",
    "we also remark that contextual models of reasoning play an important role in artificial intelligence ( see f.i .",
    "giunchiglia ( 1993 ) @xcite , mccarthy ( 1993 ) @xcite .",
    "we now come back to the problem of rationality in decision making .",
    "we remark that contextuality of reasoning is closely coupled with the so called ` framing effect ' .",
    "kreps ( 1988 ) @xcite remarks ( p. 197 ) that the way in which a decision problem is framed or posed can affect the choices made by decision makers .  according to tversky and kahnemann ( 1981 )",
    "@xcite the term ` decision frame ' refers ( p. 453 ) to the decision - maker s conception of the acts , outcomes and contingencies associated with a particular choice .",
    "one of the most important contributions of the ql approach to the problem of contextual reasoning is the recognition of the existence of incompatible contexts and the use of well developed quantum tools for testing incompatibility , such as heisenberg s uncertainty relation or the violation of bell s inequality ( see f.i .",
    "khrennikov and haven ( 2007 ) @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , in the * *  * * prisoner s dilemma game the contexts @xmath21 ( the decision of the partner is known ) , and @xmath22 ( information is absent ) , are incompatible .",
    "consequently , the ql approach is about :    1 .",
    "the violation of the sure thing principle , 2 .",
    "` irrational ' decision making , 3 .",
    "non - bayesian decision making , and 4 .   the usage of subadditive probability .",
    "all these problems have already been widely discussed in traditional approaches to cognitive science , psychology , behavioral economics and finance .",
    "the ql approach is just one of the mathematical models which accurately describes all of the above effects .",
    "finally , we point to one of the pioneer papers that assigned quantum - like contextuality to the measurement of belief in decision making theories .",
    "suppes ( 1974 ) @xcite conjectured that general concepts taken from quantum mechanics could provide for the measurement of belief .",
    "he also explained the importance of the particular measurement context , by asserting that ( p. 172 ) :  it is a mistake to think of beliefs as being stored in some fixed and inert form in the memory of a person .",
    "when a question is asked about personal beliefs , one constructs a belief coded in a belief statement as a response to the question . as the kind of question varies , the construction varies , and the results vary .     *",
    "* w**e could articulate that the notion of measurement context , borrowed from quantum mechanics can be regarded as one of the promising theories of measurement of belief .",
    "with the help of the above mentioned features of ql models we now attempt to describe the dynamics of the process of decision making within the problem setting of party governance in the us - type two party system .",
    "this system allows voters to cast partisan ballots in two contests : executive and legislative . by",
    "so doing they can thus choose for instance ` republican ' in one institutional choice setting and ` democratic ' in the other ( see zorn and smith ( 2011 ) @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known from physics that the quantum state dynamics are described by schrdinger s equation .",
    "this type of dynamics is unitary . roughly speaking it",
    "is combined of a family of rotations and in principle , this family can be infinite .",
    "pothos and busemeyer ( 2009 ) @xcite applied this equation to model the dynamics of the process of decision making in games of the prisoner s dilemma type .",
    "however , it is questionable whether we can describe the dynamics of voters expectation by the schrdinger s equation .",
    "this equation describes the dynamics of an isolated system , i.e. , a system which does not interact with the environment .",
    "a voter in the context of the election campaign definitely can not be considered as an isolated social system .",
    "she , say alice , is in permanent contact with mass media ( whether tv or internet ) .",
    "such an influence of the environment induces random fluctuations of opinions and choices in alice s mind .    for the purposes of our research ,",
    "we are interested in the ` unstable ' part of the electorate which is composed of citizens who have no concrete opinions and who will make their electoral choice  very close to the actual day of the elections ( see zaller and feldman ( 1992 ) @xcite ) .",
    "if alice could be considered as an isolated social system , then the only possibility to describe a transition from the mental state of superposition of choices to the state corresponding to the concrete choice was to use the projection postulate of quantum mechanics ( the so called ` von neumann postulate ' ) .",
    "this state reduction process , from superposition to one of its components , is called _ _ the state collapse__. such collapse is imagined as an instantaneous ( the jump - type ) transition from one state to another . the state collapse might be used to describe the situation in which alice makes her choice precisely at the moment of completing the voting bulletin .",
    "this type of behavior can not be completely excluded from consideration , but such a case is probably not statistically significant . moreover",
    ", mainstream quantum mechanical thought will tell us that the state collapse occurs when an isolated system driven by schrdinger s equation interacts practically instantaneously with a measurement device .",
    "thus when alice is totally isolated from the election campaign , she is suddenly asked to make her choice .",
    "it is evident that the process of decision making for the majority of the ` unstable population ' in the electorate differs in essential ways from this collapse - type behavior",
    ".    therefore , let us take more seriously the role which the social environment plays in the process of decision making .",
    "we apply to social science the theory of _ open quantum systems _ , i.e. , systems which interact with a large thermostat ( ` bath ' ) .",
    "since a bath is a huge physical system with millions of variables ( the complexity of the social bath  around an american citizen who will cast his / her vote in the election campaign is huge ) , it is in general impossible to provide a reasonable mathematical description of the dynamics of a quantum system interacting with such a bath .",
    "physicists proceed under a few assumptions which allow then for the possibility to describe those dynamics in an approximate way . in quantum physics",
    "the interaction of a quantum system with a bath is described by a quantum version of the master equation for markovian dynamics .",
    "the quantum markovian dynamics are given by the _ gorini - kossakowski - sudarshan - lindblad _",
    "( gksl ) equation .",
    "see e.g. ingarden et al .",
    "( 1997 ) @xcite for details .",
    "this gskl equation * *  * * is the most popular approximation of quantum dynamics in the presence of interaction with a bath .",
    "we briefly * *  * * remind the origin**s * * of the gksl - dynamics .",
    "the starting point is that the state of a composite system , a quantum system @xmath23 combined with a bath , is a pure quantum state , complex vector @xmath24 the evolution of * *  * * @xmath25 is described by schrdinger s equation .",
    "this is an evolution in a hilbert space of a huge dimension , since a bath has so many degrees of freedom .",
    "the existence of the schrdinger dynamics in the huge hilbert space has a merely theoretical value .",
    "observers are interested in the dynamics of the state @xmath26 of the quantum system @xmath27 the next fundamental assumption in the derivation of the gksl - equation is the markovian character of the evolution , i.e. the absence of long term memory effects .",
    "it is assumed that interaction with the bath destroys such effects .",
    "thus , the gksl - evolution is a markovian evolution .",
    "finally , we point to the condition of the ` factorizability ' of the initial state of a composite system ( a quantum system coupled with a bath ) , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the sign of the tensor product .",
    "physically factorization is equivalent to the absence of correlations .",
    "one of the distinguishing features of the evolution under the mentioned assumptions is the existence of one or few _ equilibrium points . _",
    "the state of the quantum system @xmath23 stabilizes to one of such points in the process of evolution : a pure initial state , a complex vector @xmath30 is transformed into a mixed state , a density matrix @xmath31 ( classical state without superposition effects ) .",
    "in contrast to the gksl - evolution , the schrdinger evolution does _ not _ induce stabilization .",
    "any solution different from an eigenvector of the hamiltonian will oscillate for ever .",
    "another property of the schrdinger dynamics is that it _",
    "always _ transfers a pure state into a pure state , i.e. , a vector into a vector : quantumness if it was originally present in a state ( in the form of superposition ) can not disappear in the process of a continuous dynamical evolution .",
    "the transition from quantum indeterminism to classical determinism can happen only as the result of the collapse of the quantum state .",
    "on the one hand , in our model of the decision making for party governance we would like to avoid the usage of the state collapse .",
    "on the other hand , to make a decision , alice has to make a transition from a quantum to a classical representation of her preferences .",

    "we now list the social conditions corresponding to the above mentioned physical conditions .",
    "this will allow us for a possibility to apply the gksl - equation :    * ( * compl * ) _  complexity : _ the social environment ( election bath ) influencing a voter has huge complexity * ( * free * ) _ freedom : _ the mental state of a society under consideration is a pure ql state , i.e. , * a * superposition of various opinions and expectations ; * ( * dem * ) _ democracy _ : the feedback reaction of a voter to the election bath is negligibly small , it can not essentially change the mental state of the bath ; * ( * sep * ) _ separability _ : before the start of the election campaign a voter was independent of the election bath ; * ( * mark * ) _ markovness _ : a voter does not use a long range memory on interaction with the election bath to update her state .",
    "we surely need to make some comments on those assumptions .    1 .",
    "the assumption ( * compl * ) , _ complexity _ , is definitely justified .",
    "nowadays an election campaign has huge information complexity : the richness of media sources accounts for such complexity .",
    "we can even speculate that the proposed ql model is more adequate than say 50 years ago : the phenomenal increase of information complexity makes the usage of the ( quantum , quantum - like ) open systems approach more reasonable .",
    "the ( * free * ) , _ freedom _ , can be interpreted as guaranteeing the freedom of political opinions .",

    "the ( * mark*)-assumption , _ markovness _ , also reflects the fact that voters under study are not that interested in politics .",

    "the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics implies that quantum markovean fluctuations stabilize to steady solutions . in physics , this theoretical prediction was confirmed by numerous experiments .",
