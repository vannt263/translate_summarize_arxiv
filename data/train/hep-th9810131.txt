    "in this paper , we investigate the quantum electromagnetic field in the vacuum region outside a half  space filled with a uniform , non  dispersive dielectric .",
    "we compute the expectations of the squares of the electric and magnetic fields in this region .",
    "we have two motivations for this .",
    "first , the problem is natural in the study of quantum optics . indeed",
    ", other workers have already investigated some aspects of this situation , for example , the effects of a nearby dielectric on atomic transition rates ( see , e.g. , khosravi and loudon 1991 , 1992 ) . here",
    "we compute the expectations of the squares of the electric and magnetic fields , thus providing predictions of the casimir  polder force on an ( electrically or magnetically ) polarizable atom near the dielectric .",
    "these predictions test the ultraviolet renormalization of the the theory at a deeper level than do the transition  rate ones .    our main motivation ,",
    "however , comes from the hypothesized uses of negative energy densities to fuel exotic general  relativistic and thermodynamic effects .",
    "serious workers have considered the possibility that negative energy densities might give rise to `` worm holes , '' `` warp drives '' and `` time machines . ''",
    "such predictions depend on being able to generate persistent negative energy densities . at present ,",
    "the only way that this might be achieved within reasonably well  understood physics is via casimir  type effects . in the original casimir ( 1948 )",
    "effect , for example , the energy density due to the quantum electromagnetic field between two perfect parallel plane conductors is predicted to be negative .",
    "it should immediately be remarked that this negative energy density has never been directly observed . of the stress ",
    "energy ( sparnaay 1957 , 1958 ; lamoreaux 1997 , bordag _ et al .",
    "the energy density is @xmath0 .",
    "these two operators do not commute .",
    "there is a connection between them , in that the long  time average of the force is minus the gradient of the energy , but present experiments seem far from being able to measure @xmath1 .",
    "this operator may as a matter of principle not be directly observable ; see helfer 1998 . ] still , it is this prediction which has generated an enormous amount of theoretical work , because the possible consequences are so spectacular .",
    "we wanted to know what would happen to the prediction of negative energy densities if the plates were no longer idealized as perfect conductors .",
    "a realistic treatment of this would require a theory of the quantum electromagnetic field in inhomogeneous absorptive and dispersive media at finite temperature .",
    "such theories are only now under development ( see , e.g. , matloob _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) , so it seems wise to consider as a first step the case of a non  absorptive , non  dispersive medium at zero temperature .",
    "thus we shall consider the case of a half ",
    "space filled with a material of ( frequency  independent ) dielectric constant @xmath2 . while the case of a perfect conductor is formally the limit @xmath3 of this , an imperfect conductor is not well represented by such a model with @xmath2 finite .",
    "so we shall not be able to make any positive predictions about the behavior of real conductors .",
    "still , our results are strong enough to bear on the case of conductors .",
    "we shall find that , for dielectrics , finite@xmath2 effects _ can not _ be neglected , especially in computations of the electromagnetic contribution to the energy density . in the case of two parallel half ",
    "spaces , these finite@xmath2 corrections do not alter the attractive nature of the casimir force , but may contribute a positive , separation  independent energy density which dominates the negative , separation  dependent , casimir energy density .",
    "this strongly suggests that only after a careful treatment of the physics of real conductors will we know whether the perfect  conductor idealization is adequate for computing the energy density in such cases .",
    "it is not easy to say accurately and briefly why a finite dielectric constant should modify the energy density to this degree , because the physics is non  local and depends on quantum interference .",
    "the presence of a polarizable medium in a region alters the field operators , by causing reflection and refraction of modes at the boundary .",
    "if the geometry is particularly simple ( a plane interface ) and the reflection sufficiently idealized ( a perfect conductor ) , one has a great deal of cancellation .",
    "small deviations from these idealizations can potentially lead to large effects .",
    "this is beacuse the energy density and the squares of the field strengths are defined by ultraviolet  divergent integrals ( and must be renormalized ) .",
    "to explain the situation more quantitativley , we first review some aspects of the casimir effect , and then discuss the idealizations that have been made and how they might be expected to be modified in a more realistic treatment .    between two perfect parallel plane conductors , one finds that the renormalized energy density is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the distance between the plates . that this is independent of position can be shown on invariance grounds ( and relies on the ideal , perfect  conductor boundary conditions ) .",
    "however , the electric and magnetic fields are _ not _ position  independent ; one finds @xmath6 at distance @xmath7 from one plate .",
    "near one plate , as @xmath8 , we find the asymptotic forms @xmath9 in other words , the renormalized expectations of @xmath10 and @xmath11 both diverge near a perfectly conducting plate , but there is a perfect cancellation between the divergent terms , leaving only a finite result .",
    "several commments on this are in order .",
    "first , the negative expectation of @xmath12 occurs because it is a renormalized quantity , and means that the fluctuations of @xmath13 are less than those of the minkowski vacuum .",
    "second , the divergences of @xmath14 and @xmath15 as @xmath8 are not expected to be physical , but rather arise from the idealized boundary conditions used .",
    "a real conductor would not be well approximated by a perfect conductor within atomic distances , and probably not within its plasma wavelength .",
    "thus the expressions ( [ ahab])([beelzebub ] ) are really only expected to be valid when one is sufficiently far from the conductor to neglect atomic structure and finite skin  depth .",
    "still , one is led to ask what would happen if the antisymmetry between the divergent parts of @xmath14 and @xmath15 could be disturbed .",
    "could one produce energy densities much greater in magnitude than the casimir expression ( [ casimir ] ) ? a natural way to try to do",
    "this is to replace the perfect conductor by a dielectric , and this is what we have done here . of course",
    ", our model is not expected to be accurate within atomic distances or even scales of the order of a skin  depth .",
    "still , we shall be able to draw some interesting conclusions .",
    "we are able to compute @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 explicitly , as functions of the distance @xmath7 from the dielectric boundary and of the dielectric susceptibility @xmath20 .",
    "the expressions have the form @xmath21 where the @xmath22s are transcendental functions of @xmath20 .",
    "( see equations [ dagobert ] , [ ephraim ] , [ fandango ] , [ gerard ] . )",
    "we find in particular that the energy density in the vacuum half ",
    "space has the form @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a positive function of @xmath20 .",
    "this means that the total energy per unit surface area of the electromagnetic field on the vacuum side , @xmath25 is divergent .",
    "this is unphysical and again can be ascribed to the oversimplification of our model , where all modes , of whatever frequency , are equally affected by the dielectric . in a more realistic model , the dielectric s atomic structure",
    "would be taken into account .",
    "this would mean that at small distances ( of the order of the skin depth probably and at the atomic scale certainly ) the energy density would not be given by @xmath26 , but by some other , presumably finite , expression .",
    "correspondingly , we ought really to think of our theory as an effective field theory valid only up to frequencies corresponding to wavelengths of order the skin depth or so .    in the next section ,",
    "we outline the technical details of the computations . in section 3 , we summarize the asymptotic behaviors of the squares of the @xmath22s for the squares of the fields , and present the graphs of these functions . section 4 summarizes the behavior of the expectation of the stress tensor .",
    "section 5 contains discussions of the significance of our results , and section 6 recapitualiates the main conclusions .",
    "the case of a half ",
    "space uniformly filled with a dielectric has been studied earlier , and we shall use the orthonormal eigenmodes as given by carniglia and mandel ( 1971 ) .",
    "we shall take the @xmath7 axis to be normal to the interface , with @xmath7 increasing in the vacuum region .",
    "we take advantage of the translational symmetries in time and in the @xmath27 directions to resolve all modes by fourier transforms in these variables , with fourier transform variables @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "these fourier transform variables thus retain their senses on both sides of the interface .",
    "the dielectric constant is @xmath30 .",
    "the wave number in the @xmath7direction is @xmath31 in the vacuum and @xmath32 in the dielectric .",
    "thus we have @xmath33 in what follows @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the unit vectors in the @xmath36 and @xmath7directions . in later sections",
    ", hats will indicate field operators , too , but no confusion should arise .",
    "we shall only need the modes on the vacuum side of the interface .",

    "another check is provided by the vanishing of @xmath77 , as will be discussed in section 4 .",
    "in the previous section , we found the expectations of the squares of the fields explicitly . in each case",
    "the result had the form @xmath78 , where @xmath7 was the distance to the interface and @xmath22 was a complicated transcendental function of the susceptibility @xmath20 . in this section",
    ", we present the graphs of the functions @xmath22 , as well as their limiting behaviors for @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the functions @xmath81 ( scaled to have a common limiting value ) are presented in figure  1 .",
    "they are in each case monotonic and approach a constant value asymptotically , but the approach is extremely slow .    for @xmath82",
    ", we have @xmath83 it is good to observe that all the above expectation values tend to zero as @xmath82 ( vacuum ) .    for @xmath84 ( that is , @xmath80 )",
    ", we find @xmath85 we note that in the limit @xmath80 , these quantities attain the values they would have in the case of the half ",
    "space outside a perfectly conducting plane ( see _ e.g. _ barton 1990 ) .",
    "this is in accord with the usual formal identification of perfect conductors with dielectrics of infinite susceptibility .",
    "however , the approach to this limit is rather slow .",
    "one needs @xmath86 for @xmath87 to be within 50% of its limiting value , and @xmath88 to be within 10% .    for completeness , we list the limiting behaviors of squares of the full fields : @xmath89 for @xmath79 , and @xmath90 for @xmath80 .",
    "by symmetry considerations , the expectation of the renormalized stress tensor must be diagonal .",
    "the ` @xmath7 ' component of the divergence constraint implies that @xmath91 must be independent of @xmath7 ; however , as all components must be multiples of @xmath92 , this component must be zero .",
    "( the verification that one does get zero using our values of the squares of the fields provides another check on our calculation . ) since the tensor is trace  free and the ` @xmath93 ' and ` @xmath94 ' components must be equal , there is only one algebraically independent component .",
    "we may take this to be the energy density @xmath95 , the other non  zero terms being @xmath96 .",

    "the expectation of the energy density has the following limiting behaviours : + for @xmath98 we have @xmath99 and for @xmath84 we have @xmath100    the graph of the coefficient @xmath24 is given in figure  2 .",
    "it has a single maximum with value @xmath101 at @xmath102 .",
    "the fall  off is again very slow , with @xmath24 still at 50% its maximum value for @xmath103 , and still at 10% its maximum for @xmath104 .",
    "we have found that the expectations of the renormalized squares of the components of the electric and magnetic fields at distance @xmath7 from a non  dispersive dielectric all have the form @xmath105 , where the coefficents @xmath22 depend on the susceptibility @xmath20 .",
    "these coefficients vary linearly near @xmath106 , and tend monotonically but very slowly to asymptotic constant values as @xmath80 . for the electric field components",
    ", one has @xmath107 ; while for the magnetic field one has @xmath108 .",
    "for the energy density , the corresponding coefficient @xmath24 rises linearly near @xmath106 , attains a maximum at @xmath102 , and then falls very slowly to zero as @xmath80 .",
    "previous authors have considered the quantum optical effects of a non  dispersive dielectric half ",
    "space on atomic transition rates ( e.g. khosravi & loudon 1991 , 1992 ) .",
    "those results are in some sense complementary to these : those test the field operators over a small range of frequencies ; whereas the present ones depend on integrating over all frequencies .",
    "the present results depend crucially on the successful ultraviolet renormalization of the theory .",
    "an immediate consequence of these formulas is a prediction for the casimir  polder force on a polarizable atom near a dielectric .",
    "if the polarizability is @xmath109 , then the induced dipole is @xmath110 , and the potential energy is @xmath111 .",
    "if in the regime in question we may neglect the frequencey  dependence of the polarizability , then , in the vacuum state of the electromagnetic field the potential energy is the vacuum state of the electromagnetic field , this becomes @xmath112 where @xmath113 . in principle",
    ", a parallel treatment applies to derive a ` magnetic casimir ",
    "polder ' force depending on magnetic polarizability .",
    "the casimir  polder force on a polarizable atom near a conductor has been measured in recent years ( sukenik _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) , although as yet there has been no measurement near a dielectric .",
    "one of our main motivations for studying this model was to uncover its limitations .",
    "we noted early on that a real physical dielectric can not be well approximated as a uniform medium on arbitrarily small scales .",
    "this means that we can not expect our model to accurately capture the physics of the field modes whose wavelengths are less than the atomic scale ( certainly ) or the skin depth ( probably ) . in particular , our predictions must break down as one gets within a distance of this order of the interface .",
    "one vivid manifestation of this is the electromagnetic field energy of the vacuum half  space , per unit surface area .",
    "this surface energy density is @xmath114 which is _ divergent _ at the lower limit .",
    "( for an earlier investigation of a closely related effect , see bordag and lindig 1996 . )",
    "it is not physically plausible that this energy density diverges ; rather , the divergence reflects an improper model of physics near the interface .",
    "a more correct version would have the form @xmath115 where @xmath116 is of the order of the skin depth .",
    "the energies we are considering here represent electromagnetic contributions to the constitutive energy of the medium .",
    "( in a more realistic treatment , it might not be meaningful to isolate one class of electromagnetic contributions from others , however . )",
    "it is plausible that these depend very much on the chemical physics of the material , and so the vagueness in the form ( [ hector ] ) is apt .",
    "the numerical value of the contribution from the second term in ( [ hector ] ) is quite modest for everyday materials . taking the rather small value @xmath117 and @xmath118",
    ", we find @xmath119 .      in this paper ,",
    "we have only treated the electromagnetic field in the vacuum half ",
    "space outside the dielectric .",
    "this case would seem to be of more interest than the field within the dielectric .",
    "still , it is natural to ask what would happen there .    in principle",
    ", techniques like ours should apply to compute the operators @xmath120 and @xmath13 within the dielectric .",
    "the integrals involved are more difficult than those on the vacuum side , though .    aside from technical difficulties in evaluating the integrals",
    ", there is another point which must be considered in the dielectric region . in that region ,",
    "the ultraviolet asymptotics of the two  point functions are different than in minkowski space .",
    "( because the two  point functions are singular on characteristics , and there is a different speed of light in the dielectric medium . ) this means that the renormalization can not be accomplished by subtracting the minkowski",
    " space vacuum quantities .",
    "one could presumably renormalize by subtracting the quantities associated to a uniform dielectric .",
    "if one does this , then the local energy density differs from that of minkowski space by an infinite amount .",
    "we believe the resolution to this point is the same as that discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "one can not accept the present model as an accurate picture of physics at all scales , and it is really only to be considered as an effective field theory , valid for frequencies below some cut  off .",
    "the difference in energy densities should be finite , with one contribution due to the effective field theory with a cut  off , and another due to the details of the chemical physics of the medium .",
    "one of our motivations for this work was to get a better understanding of the negative energy density occuring in the casimir effect .    the casimir effect  corresponding to two parallel plane conductors  is _ formally _ the limit as @xmath3 of two parallel dielectric half  spaces .",
    "however , this identification only holds at the limit , and only in the sense that in this case the reflections and refractions of the field modes at the dielectric interfaces approach the perfect  conductor boundary conditions as @xmath121 .",
    "a real conductor , with finite conductivity , has a dielectric function which is significantly dispersive and absorptive , and can not be modeled by a constant large real positive @xmath2 .",
    "thus our present model can not make any positive quantitative predictions about the casimir effect for conductors .",
    "however , we shall show that at least for dielectrics , the effects of a finite @xmath2 can not be ignored , and that in realistic situations it seems most likely that the total expected energy density , including separation  independent contributions from the half  spaces , is _",
    "positive_. this suggests strongly that we must investigate the real physics of conductors before we can conclude that the total expected energy density between the plates is negative .",
    "consider two non  dispersive half ",
    "space dielectrics , of the same susceptibility , parallel and separated by a distance @xmath5 .",
    "then the total energy ( per unit cross  sectional area ) will have the form @xmath122 the function @xmath123 has been computed by lifshitz ( 1956 ) . here",
    "@xmath124 is ( twice ) the energy of either dielectric in isolation .    for the energy density ,",
    "let @xmath7 with @xmath125 be a coordinate normal to the interface planes .",
    "then near either interface one expects the energy density to be dominated by the physics of that interface , and so to be @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the coefficient we computed previously , equation ( [ ichabod ] ) .",
    "we shall write these two contributions as @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "the total energy density will be @xmath130 where @xmath131 must on dimensional grounds have the form @xmath132 , and be less singular at the interfaces than @xmath133 , @xmath134 .",
    "indeed , the integral @xmath135 must be finite .",
    "thus @xmath136 has at most mild singularities at the interfaces .",
    "the form of the function @xmath136 is at present unknown . as a very rough approximation",
    ", we shall assume it is constant in @xmath137 , that is , the ` casimir ' contribution to the expected energy density is uniformly distributed between the half  spaces .",
    "we may ask if this value dominates the contribution @xmath138 from the dielectrics , that is , if @xmath139 is positive or negative .",
    "this question can be answered by comparing our results with those of lifshitz ( 1956 ) , who computed the force of attraction of the two dielectrics .",
    "we find numerically that the energy density @xmath140 dominates the average energy density unless @xmath141 .",
    "in other words , if the ` casimir ' contribution to the energy density is distributed uniformly , the total energy density would be everywhere positive between the half ",
    "spaces unless @xmath20 could be made to exceed @xmath142 .",
    "a real dielectric exhibits absorption and dispersion ; we can expect our model to be valid at distances of order @xmath7 if the dielectric susceptibility is ( nearly ) a real positive constant for several orders of magnitude of frequency bracketing @xmath143 .",
    "there seems to be nothing in the kramers  kronig relations preventing this from holding for the sorts of values of @xmath20 discussed above .",
    "still , the scales are extreme enough that one wonders whether such susceptibility functions are more mathematical curiosities than physical possibilities . in other words ,",
    "unless remarkable materials exist , with @xmath144 approximately a real positive constant @xmath145 for several orders of magnitude of @xmath28 , it seems unlikely the total expected energy density anywhere between the dielectric half ",
    "spaces will be negative",
    ".    we should like to emphasize that while the contributions from the dielectrics probably make the energy density positive , their separation  independence ensures that they do not alter the usual predictions of the attractive force between the dielectrics .",
    "indeed , we have used lifshitz s results in our argument , and we accept his values for the force .",
    "negative energy densities were first discovered in quantum field theory with casimir s prediction of an attractive force between two parallel perfect plane conductors . since then , there has been considerable speculation on what the physical consequences of these negative energy densities might be .",
    "the present model was introduced as a first step away from the idealization of boundary conditions induced by a dielectric of infinite susceptibility .",
    "it has been chosen for its relative mathematical simplicity , and it is unrealistic in that it neglects dispersion and absorption .",
    "still , we find that the effects of finite  susceptibility contributions go as @xmath146 and can be very significant : in the range that our model is likely to be valid , it seems that these contributions can make the _ total _",
    "energy density between two dielectric half  spaces positive , while preserving the attractive force found by lifshitz .",
    "one can not , from our model , draw any definite conclusion about the behavior of the energy density between two real conducting plates .",
    "what sorts of separation  independent corrections there are , due to finite conductivity , are at present unknown .",
    "but it does seem clear that we will only be justified in having confidence in theoretical predictions of the energy density between two real conducting plates if we take into account finite  conductivity effects ."
