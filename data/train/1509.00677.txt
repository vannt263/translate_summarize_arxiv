    "astrometry , that branch of observational astronomy that deals with the precise and accurate estimation of angular positions of light - emitting ( usually point - like ) sources projected against the celestial sphere , is the oldest technique employed in the study of the heavens @xcite .",
    "repeated measurements of positions , spread over time , allow a determination of the motions and distances of theses sources , with astrophysical implications on dynamical studies of stellar systems and the milky way as a whole . with the advent of solid - state detectors and all - digital techniques applied to radio - interferometry and specialized ground- and space - based missions , astrometry has been revolutionized in recent years , as we have entered a high - precision era in which this technique has started to play an increasingly important role in all areas of astronomy , astrophysics @xcite , and cosmology @xcite .",
    "current technology , based on two - dimensional discrete digital detectors ( such as _ charged coupled devices _ - ccds ) , record a ( noisy ) image ( on an array of photo - sensitive pixels ) of celestial sources , from which it is possible to estimate both their astrometry and photometry , simultaneously @xcite .",
    "the inference problem associated to the determination of these quantities is at the core of the astrometric endeavor described previously .",
    "a number of techniques have been proposed to estimate the location and flux of celestial sources as recorded on digital detectors . in this context , estimators based on the use of a least - squares error function ( ls hereafter ) have been widely adopted @xcite .",
    "the use of this type of decision rule has been traditionally justified through heuristic reasons and because they are conceptually straightforward to formulate based on the observation model of these problems .",
    "indeed , the ls approach was the classical method used when the observations were obtained with analog devices @xcite ( which corresponds to a gaussian noise model for the observations , different from that of modern digital detectors , which is characterized instead by a poisson statistics ) and , consequently , the ls method was naturally adopted from the analogous to the digital observational setting . ] .    in contemporary astrometry ( gaia , for instance )",
    ", stellar positions will be obtained by optimizing a likelihood function ( see , e.g. , @xcite , which uses the equivalent of our equations  ( [ eq_pre_5 ] ) and  ( [ log - like ] ) in sections  [ sub_sec_astro_photo ] and  [ subsec_achie ] respectively ) , not by ls . nevertheless , since ls methods offer computationally efficient implementations and have shown reasonable performance @xcite they are still widely used in astrometry either on general - purpose software packages for the analysis of digital images such as daophot @xcite , or on dedicated pipelines , such as that adopted in the sloan digital sky survey survey ( sdss hereafter , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , in daophot astrometry ( and photometry ) are obtained through a two - step process which involves a ls minimization of a trial function ( e.g. , a bi - dimensional gaussian , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation  6 ) , equivalent to our one - dimensional case in equation  ( [ eq_subsec_mse_of_ls_1 ] ) , section  [ subsec_achie ] ) , and then applying a correction by means of an empirically determined look - up table ( also computed performing a ls on a set of high signal - to - noise ratio images distributed over the field of view of the image , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation  8) ) .",
    "this last step accounts for the fact that the psf of the image under analysis may not be exactly gaussian .",
    "the sdss pipeline ( @xcite ) obtains its centroids also through a two - step process : first it fits a karhunen - love transform ( kl transform hereafter , see , e.g. , @xcite ) to a set of isolated bright stars in the field - of - view of the image , and then it uses the base functions determined in this way , to fit the astrometry and photometry for the object(s ) under consideration using a ls minimization scheme ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation  ( 5 ) ) ) .",
    "both codes , daophot and the sdss pipeline have been extensively used and tested by the astronomical community , giving very reliable results ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    considering that ls methods are still in use in astrometry , and driven by the increase in the intrinsic precision available by the new detectors and instrumental settings , and by the fact that ccds will likely continue to be the detector of choice for the focal - plane in science - quality imaging application at optical wavelengths for both space- as well as ground - borne programs , it is timely to re - visit the pertinence of the use of ls estimators . indeed ,",
    "in the digital setting , where we observe discrete samples ( or counts ) on a photon integrating device , there is no formal justification that the ls approach is optimal in the sense of minimizing the mean - square - error ( mse ) of the parameter estimation , in particular for astrometry , which is the focus of this work .",
    "the question of optimality ( in some statistical sense ) has always been in the interest of the astronomical community , in particular the idea of characterizing fundamental performance bounds that can be used to analyze the efficiency of the adopted estimation schemes . in this context",
    ", we can mention some seminal works on the use of the celebrated cramr - rao  ( cr hereafter ) bound in astronomy by @xcite ; and @xcite .",
    "the cr bound is a minimum variance ( mv ) bound for the family of unbiased estimators @xcite . in astrometry and photometry",
    "this bound has offered meaningful closed - form expressions that can be used to analyze the complexity of the inference task , and its dependency on key observational and design parameters such as the position of the object in the array , the intensity of the object , the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr hereafter ) , and the resolution of the instrument @xcite . in particular , for photometry , @xcite used the cr bound to show that the ls estimator is a good estimator , achieving a performance close to the limit in a wide range of observational regimes , and approaching very closely the bound at low snr . in astrometry , on the other hand , @xcite have recently studied the structure of this bound and have analyzed its dependency with respect to important observational parameters , under realistic astronomical observing conditions . in those works , closed - form expressions for the bound were derived in a number of important settings ( high spatial resolution , low and high snr ) , and their trends were explored across angular resolution and the position of the object in the array . as an interesting outcome , the analysis of the cr bound allows us to find the optimal pixel resolution of the array for a given setting , as well as providing formal justification to some heuristic techniques commonly used to improve performance in astrometry , like _ dithering _ for undersampled images ( * ? ? ?",
    "the specific problem of evaluating the existence of an estimator that achieves the cr bound has not been covered in the literature , and remains an interesting open problem . on this , @xcite have empirically assessed ( using numerical simulations ) the performance of two ls methods and the maximum - likelihood ( ml hereafter ) estimator , showing that their variances follow very closely the cr limit in some specific regimes . in this paper , we analyze in detail the performance of the ls estimator with respect to the cr bound , with the goal of finding concrete regimes , if any , where this estimator approaches the cr bound and , consequently , where it can be considered an efficient solution to the astrometric problem .",
    "this application is a challenging one , because estimators based on a ls type of objective function do not have a closed - form expression in astrometry .",
    "in fact , this estimation approach corresponds to a non linear regression problem , where the resulting estimator is implicitly defined . as a result",
    ", no expressions for the performance of the ls estimator can be obtained analytically .",
    "to address this issue , our main result ( theorem [ ls_performances_bounds ] , section  [ subsec_mse_of_ls ] ) derives expressions that bound and approximate the variance of the ls estimator .",
    "our approach is based on the work by @xcite , where the authors tackle the problem of approximating the bias and mse of general estimators that are the solution of an optimization problem . in @xcite",
    "another methodology is given to approximate the variance and mean of implicitly defined estimators , which has been applied to medical imaging and acoustic source localization @xcite .",
    "the main result of our paper is a refined version of the result presented in @xcite , where one of their key assumptions , which is not applicable in our estimation problem , is reformulated . in this process , we derive lower and upper bounds for the mse performance of the ls estimator . using these bounds ,",
    "we analyze how closely the performance of the ls estimator approaches the cr bound across different observational regimes .",
    "we show that for high snr there is a considerable gap between the cr bound and the performance of the ls estimator .",
    "remarkably , we show that for the more challenging low snr observational regime ( weak astronomical sources ) , the ls estimator is near optimal , as its performance is arbitrarily close to the cr bound .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec_pre ] introduces the problem , notation , as well as some preliminary results .",
    "section [ main_sec ] represents the main contribution , where theorem [ ls_performances_bounds ] and its interpretation are introduced .",
    "section [ subsec_empirical ] shows numerical analyses of the performance of ls estimator under different observational regimes .",
    "finally section [ final ] provides a summary of our results , and some final remarks .",
    "in this section we introduce the problem of astrometry as well as concepts and definitions that will be used throughout the paper . for simplicity , we focus on the 1-d scenario of a linear array detector , as it captures the key conceptual elements of the problem .",
    "the specific problem of interest is the inference of the position of a point source .",
    "this source is parameterized by two scalar quantities , the position of the object @xmath0 in the array , and its intensity ( or brightness , or flux ) that we denote by @xmath1 .",
    "these two parameters induce a probability @xmath2 over an observation space that we denote by @xmath3 .",
    "more precisely , given a point source represented by the pair @xmath4 , it creates a nominal intensity profile in a photon integrating device , typically a ccd , which can be generally written as :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 denotes the one dimensional normalized point spread function ( psf ) evaluated on the pixel coordinate @xmath7 , and where @xmath8 is a generic parameter that determines the width ( or spread ) of the light distribution on the detector ( typically a function of wavelength and the quality of the observing site , see section  [ subsec_empirical ] ) ( see @xcite for more details ) .    the profile in equation  ( [ eq_pre_1 ] )",
    "is not observed directly , but through three sources of perturbations : first , an additive background which accounts for the photon emissions of the open ( diffuse ) sky and the contributions from the noise of the instrument itself ( the read - out noise and dark - current @xcite ) modeled by @xmath9 in equation  ( [ eq_pre_2b ] ) .",
    "second , an intrinsic uncertainty between the aggregated intensity ( the nominal object brightness plus the background ) and the actual measurements , denoted by @xmath10 in what follows , which is modeled by independent random variables that obey a poisson probability law . and , finally , we need to consider the spatial quantization process associated with the pixel - resolution of the detector as specified by @xmath11 in equations  ( [ eq_pre_2b ] ) and  ( [ eq_pre_3 ] ) is sometimes referred to as the the `` pixel response function '' . ] . including these three effects",
    ", we have a countable collection of independent and not identically distributed random variables ( observations or counts ) @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , driven by the expected intensity at each pixel element @xmath14 , given by : @xmath15 and , @xmath16 where @xmath17 represents the expectation value of the argument , and @xmath18 denotes the standard uniform quantization of the real line - array with resolution @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath20 for all @xmath21 . in practice",
    ", the detector has a finite collection of measured elements ( or pixels ) @xmath22 , then a basic assumption here is that we have a good coverage of the object of interest , in the sense that for a given position @xmath23 : @xmath24 note that equation  ( [ eq_pre_3 ] ) adopts the idealized situation where every pixel has the exact same response function ( equal to unity ) , or , equivalently , that our flat - field process has been achieved with minimal uncertainty .",
    "it also assumes that the intra - pixel response is uniform .",
    "the latter is more important in the severely undersampled regime ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  1 ) ) which is not explored in this paper .",
    "however a relevant aspect of data calibration is achieving a proper flat - fielding which can affect the correctness of our analysis and the form of the adopted likelihood function ( see below ) .    at the end",
    ", the likelihood of the joint random observation vector @xmath25 ( with values in @xmath26 ) , given the source parameters @xmath27 , is given by : @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the probability mass function ( pmf ) of the poisson law @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that equation  ( [ eq_pre_5 ] ) assumes that the observations ( contained in the individual pixels , denoted by the index @xmath14 ) are independent ( although not identically distributed , since they follow @xmath30 ) .",
    "of course , this is only an approximation to the real situation since it implies , in particular , that we are neglecting any electronic defects or features in the device such as , e.g. , the cross - talk present in multi - port ccds @xcite , or read - out correlations such as the odd - even column effect in ir detectors @xcite , as well as calibration or data reduction deficiencies ( e.g. , due to inadequate flat - fielding @xcite ) that may alter this idealized detection process .",
    "a serious attempt is done by manufacturers and observatories to minimize the impact of these defects , either by an appropriate electronic design , or by adjusting the detector operational regimes ( e.g. , cross - talk can be reduced to less than 1 part in @xmath31 by adjusting the readout speed and by a proper reduction process , @xcite ) .",
    "in essence , we are considering an ideal detector that would satisfy the proposed likelihood function given by equation  ( [ eq_pre_5 ] ) , in real detectors the likelihood function could be considerably more complex .",
    "we can formulate the astrometric and photometric estimation task , as the problem of characterizing a decision rule @xmath32 , with @xmath33 being a parameter space , where given an observation @xmath34 the parameters to be estimated are @xmath35 .",
    "in other words , @xmath36 gives us a prescription ( or statistics ) that would allow us to estimate the underlying parameters @xmath4 ( the estimated parameters are denoted by @xmath37 ) from the available data vector @xmath34 .    in the simplest scenario ,",
    "in which one is interested in determining a single ( unknown ) parameter @xmath38 ( e.g. , in our case either @xmath23 or @xmath39 , assuming that all other parameters are perfectly well known ) , a commonly used decision rule adopted in statistics to estimate this parameter ( the estimation being @xmath40 ) is to consider the prescription of minimum variance ( denoted by @xmath41 ) , given by :    @xmath42    where `` @xmath43 '' represents the argument that minimizes the expression , while @xmath44 is a generic variable representing the parameter to be determined . note that in the last equality we have assumed that @xmath45 is an unbiased estimator of the parameter ( i.e. , that @xmath46 ) , so that under this rule we are implicitly minimizing the mse of the estimate with respect to the hidden true parameter @xmath38 .",
    "unfortunately , the general solution of equation  ( [ minvar ] ) is intractable , as in principle it requires the knowledge of @xmath38 , which is the essence of the inference problem .",
    "an additional issue with equation  ( [ minvar ] ) is that , by itself , it does not provide an analytical expression that tells us how to compute @xmath47 in terms of @xmath34 ( e.g. , a function of some sort ) which is trained with a ( `` good '' ) subset of the data itself ( thus approximately removing the ambiguity that the true parameter @xmath38 is , in fact , unknown ) .",
    "this heuristic approach is adopted , e.g. , in the sdss pipeline trough the use of the kl transform , which is a good approximation to a matched filter ( also known as the `` north filter '' , see e.g. , @xcite ) . ] .",
    "fortunately , there are performance bounds that characterize how far can we be from the theoretical solution in equation  ( [ minvar ] ) , and even scenarios where the optimal solution can be achieved in a closed - form ( see section  [ subsec_achie ] and appendix  [ proof_pro_achie_astrometry ] ) .",
    "one of the most significant results in this field is the cr minimum variance bound which will be further explained below .",
    "the cr bound offers a performance bound on the variance of the family of unbiased estimators .",

    "particularly , we highlight the following results , which will be used later on :    ( @xcite ) [ pro_fi_photometry_astrometry ] let us assume that @xmath68 is fixed and known , and we want to estimate @xmath39 ( fixed but unknown ) from @xmath69 in equation  ( [ eq_pre_5 ] ) . in this scalar parametric context , the fisher information is given by : @xmath70 which from equation  ( [ cr_scalar ] ) induces a mv bound for the _ photometry estimation problem_. on the other hand , if @xmath71 is fixed and known , and we want to estimate @xmath23 ( fixed but unknown ) from @xmath72 in equation  ( [ eq_pre_5 ] ) , then the fisher information is given by : @xmath73 which from equation  ( [ cr_scalar ] ) induces a mv bound for the _ astrometric estimation problem _ , and where @xmath74 denotes the ( astrometric ) cr bound .",
    "at this point it is relevant to study if there is any practical estimator that achieves the cr bound presented in equations  ( [ fi_photometry ] ) and  ( [ fi_astrometry ] ) for the photometry and astrometry problem , respectively . for the photometric case , ( * ? ? ? * their appendix a ) has shown that the classical ls estimator is near - optimal , in the sense that its variance is close to the cr bound for a wide range of experimental regimes , and furthermore , in the low snr regime , when @xmath75 , its variance ( determined in closed - form ) asymptotically achieves the mv bound @xmath76 in equation  ( [ fi_photometry ] ) .",
    "this is a formal justification for the goodness of the ls as a method for doing isolated photometry in the setting presented in section [ sub_sec_astro_photo ] .",
    "an equivalent analysis has not been conducted for the astrometric problem , which is the focus of the next section of this work .",

    "( the proof is presented in appendix [ proof_pro_achie_astrometry ] ) .",

    "however for the ( still independent ) but non - identically distributed setting of astrometry described by equation  ( [ eq_pre_5 ] ) , this asymptotic result , to the best of our knowledge , has not been proven , and remains an open problem .    on the other hand , a version of the ls estimator ( given the model presented in section [ sub_sec_astro_photo ] )",

    "in this section we explore the implications of theorem [ ls_performances_bounds ] in astrometry through the use of simulated observations .",
    "first , we analyze if the bounded condition over @xmath135 adopted in theorem  [ ls_performances_bounds ] is a valid assumption for the type of settings considered in astronomical observations . after that",
    ", we compare how efficient is the ls estimator proposed in equation  ( [ eq_subsec_mse_of_ls_1 ] ) as a function of the snr and pixel resolution , adopting for that purpose theorem [ ls_performances_bounds ] and proposition [ pro_fi_photometry_astrometry ] .",
    "to perform our simulations , we adopt some realistic design variables and astronomical observing conditions to model the problem @xcite . for the psf , various analytical and semi - empirical forms have been proposed , see for instance the ground - based model in @xcite and the space - based model in @xcite . for our analysis , we adopt in equation  ( [ eq_pre_3 ] ) the gaussian psf where @xmath136 , and where @xmath8 is the width of the psf , assumed to be known . this psf has been found to be a good representation for typical astrometric - quality ground - based data @xcite . in terms of nomenclature , the @xmath137 , measured in arcsec , denotes the _ full - width at half - maximum _ ( @xmath138 ) parameter , which is an overall indicator of the image quality at the observing site @xcite to a constant value .",
    "however , in many cases the image quality changes as a function of position in the field - of - view due to optical distortions , specially important in large focal plane arrays .",
    "for example , in the case of the sdss ( which consists of 30  ccds of 2048@xmath139 pix@xmath139 each , covering 2.3 on the sky at a resolution of 0.396  arcsec / pix ) , the @xmath138 may vary up to 15% from center to corner of _ one _ detector ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  4.1 ) ) .",
    "the impact on the cr bound of these changes has been discussed in some detail by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3.4 ) . ] .",
    "the background profile , represented by @xmath140 , is a function of several variables , like the wavelength of the observations , the moon phase ( which contributes significantly to the diffuse sky background ) , the quality of the observing site , and the specifications of the instrument itself .",
    "we will consider a uniform background across pixels underneath the psf , i.e. , @xmath141 for all @xmath14 . to characterize the magnitude of @xmath142",
    ", it is important to first mention that the detector does not measure photon counts ( or , actually , photo-@xmath143 ) directly , but a discrete variable in `` _ analog to digital units _ ( adus ) '' of the instrument , which is a linear proportion of the photon counts @xcite .",
    "this linear proportion is characterized by the gain of the instrument @xmath144 in units of @xmath143/adu .",
    "@xmath144 is just a scaling factor , where we can define @xmath145 and @xmath146 as the brightness of the object and background , respectively , in the specific adus of the instrument .",
    "then , the background ( in adus ) depends on the pixel size @xmath147 as follows @xcite : @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the ( diffuse ) sky background in adu / arcsec ( if @xmath150 is measured in arcsec ) , while @xmath151 and @xmath152 , both measured in @xmath153 , model the dark - current and read - out - noise of the detector on each pixel , respectively .",
    "note that the first component in equation  ( [ eq_subsec_empirical_1 ] ) is attributed to the site , and its effect is proportional to the pixel size . on the other hand ,",
    "the second component is attributed to errors of the integrating device ( detector ) , and it is pixel - size independent .",
    "this distinction is central when analyzing the performance as a function of the pixel resolution of the array ( see details in ( * ? ? ?",
    "more important is the fact that in typical ground - based astronomical observation , long exposure times are considered , which implies that the background is dominated by diffuse light coming from the sky ( the first term in the rhs of equation  ( [ eq_subsec_empirical_1 ] ) ) , and not from the detector ( * ? ? ?",
    "4 ) .    for the experimental conditions",
    ", we consider the scenario of a ground - based station located at a good site with clear atmospheric conditions and the specifications of current science - grade ccds , where @xmath154  adu / arcsec , @xmath155  @xmath153 , @xmath156  @xmath153 , @xmath157  arcsec and @xmath158  @xmath143/adu ( with these values @xmath159  adu for @xmath160  arcsec using equation  ( [ eq_subsec_empirical_1 ] ) ) . in terms of scenarios of analysis , we explore different pixel resolutions for the ccd array @xmath161 $ ] measured in arcsec .",
    "note that a change in @xmath147 will be reflected upon the limits of the integral to compute the pixel response function @xmath11 ( see equation  ( [ eq_pre_3 ] ) ) as well as in the calculation of the background level per pixel @xmath9 , according to equation  ( [ eq_subsec_empirical_1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , a change in @xmath150 is not only a design feature of the detector device , but it implies also a change in the distribution of the background underneath the psf .",
    "the impact of this covariant device - and - atmosphere change in the cr bound is explained in detail in ( * ? ? ?",

    "these different snr scenarios can be obtained by changing appropriately the exposure time ( open shutter ) that generates the image .      to validate how realistic is the bounded assumption over @xmath165 in our problem",

    "we adopt equation  ( [ eq_subsec_mse_of_ls_2b ] ) which provides an admissible range for the mse performance of the ls estimator . for that we use the critical @xmath168",
    "obtained in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "these curves for the different snr regimes and pixel resolutions are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] . following the trend reported in figure  [ fig2 ] ,",
    "the nominal value @xmath174 is a precise indicator for the ls estimator performance for strong signals ( matching the idealized conditions stated in remark [ rm_ideal_high_snr ] ) , while on the other hand , theorem [ ls_performances_bounds ] does not indicate whether @xmath174 is accurate or not for low snr , as we deviate from the idealized case elaborated in remark [ rm_ideal_low_snr ] .",
    "nevertheless , we will see , based on some complementary empirical results reported in what follows , that even for low snr , the nominal @xmath174 predicts the performance of the ls estimator quite well .    assuming for a moment the idealized case in which @xmath115 , we can reduce the performance analysis to measuring the gap between the nominal value predicted by theorem [ ls_performances_bounds ] ( equation  ( [ nominal ] ) ) , and the cr bound in proposition [ pro_fi_photometry_astrometry ] .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the relative difference given by @xmath175 . from the figure we can clearly see that , in the low snr regime",
    ", the relative performance differences tends to zero and , consequently , the ls estimator approaches the cr bound , and it is therefore an efficient estimator .",
    "this matches what has been stated in remark [ rm_ideal_low_snr ] . on the other hand for high snr",
    ", we observe a performance gap that is non negligible ( up to @xmath176 relative difference above the cr for @xmath177  @xmath143 , and @xmath178 above the cr for @xmath179  @xmath143 for @xmath180  arcsec ) .",
    "this is consistent with what has been argued in remark [ rm_ideal_high_snr ] .",
    "note that in this regime , the idealized scenario in which @xmath124 is valid ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) and , thus , @xmath181 , which is not strictly the case for the low snr regime ( although see figure  [ fig7 ] , and the discussion that follows ) .    to refine the relative performance analysis presented in figure  [ fig4 ] , figure  [ fig : inter ]",
    "shows the feasible range ( predicted by theorem [ ls_performances_bounds ] ) of performance gap considering the critical @xmath168 obtained in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "we report four cases , from very low to very high snr regimes , to illustrate the trends . from this figure",
    ", we can see that the deviations from the nominal value are quite significant for the low snr regime , and that , from this perspective , the range obtained from theorem [ ls_performances_bounds ] is not sufficiently small to conclude about the goodness of the ls estimator in this context . on the other hand , in the high snr regime , the nominal comparison can be considered quite precise .",
    "the results of the previous paragraph motivate an empirical analysis to estimate the performance of the ls estimator empirically from the data , with the goal of resolving the low snr regime illustrated in figure  [ fig : inter ] . for this purpose ,",
    "@xmath182 realizations were considered for all the snr regimes and pixel sizes , and the performance of the ls estimator was computed using the empirical mse .",
    "we used a large number of samples to guarantee convergence to the true mse error as a consequence of the law of large numbers @xcite .",
    "remarkably , we observe in all cases that the estimated performance matches quite tightly the nominal @xmath174 characterized by theorem [ ls_performances_bounds ] .",
    "we illustrate this in figure  [ fig7 ] , which considers the most critical low snr regime .",
    "consequently , from this numerical analysis , we can resolve the ambiguity present in the low snr regime , and conclude that the comparison with the nominal result reported in figure  [ fig4 ] , and the derived conclusion about the ls estimator in the low and high snr regimes , can be considered valid .",
    "our simulations also show that the ls estimator is unbiased .",
    "overall , these results suggests that theorem [ ls_performances_bounds ] could be improved , perhaps by imposing milder sufficient conditions , in order to prove that @xmath174 is indeed a precise indicator of the mse of the ls estimator at any snr regime .    for completeness",
    ", we show in figure  [ fig_behave ] the behavior of the log - likelihood function ( computed using equation  ( [ log - like ] ) ) and the ls function @xmath183 ( computed using equation  ( [ eq_subsec_mse_of_ls_1 ] ) ) for our two extreme snr cases of our numerical simulations , namely snr= 12 and snr= 230 .",
    "in these figures the true astrometric position is at @xmath184  arcsec (= 400  pix with @xmath147 = 0.2  arcsec ) .",
    "these figures clearly show ( particularly the one at low snr ) the non - linear nature of both objective functions .",
    "our work provides results to characterize the performance of the widely used ls estimator as applied to the problem of astrometry when derived from digital discrete array detectors .",
    "the main result ( theorem [ ls_performances_bounds ] ) provides in closed - form a nominal value ( @xmath114 ) , and a range around it , for the mse of the ls estimator as well as its bias . from the predicted nominal value",
    ", we analyzed how efficient is the ls estimator in comparison with the mv cr bound .",
    "in particular , we show that the ls estimator is efficient in the regime of low snr ( a point source with a weak signal ) , in the sense that it approximates very closely the cr bound . on the other hand",
    ", we show that at high snr there is a significant gap in the performance of the ls estimator with respect to the mv bound .",
    "we believe that this sub - optimal behavior is caused by the poissonian nature of the detection process , in which the variance per pixel increases as the signal itself .",
    "since the ls method is very sensitive to outliers , the large excursions caused by the large pixel intensity variance at high snr make the ls method less efficient ( from the point of view of its mse ) , than allowed by the cr bound .",
    "these performance analyses complement and match what has been observed in photometric estimation , where only in the low snr regime the ls estimator has been shown to asymptotically achieve the cr bound .",
    "while our results are valid for an idealized linear ( one - dimensional ) array detector where intra - pixel response changes are neglected , and where flat - fielding is achieved with very high accuracy , our findings should motivate the exploration of alternative estimators in the high snr observational regime .",
    "regarding this last point , we note that an inspection of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 3 ) suggests that either a ( poisson variance- ) weighted ls or a ml approach do not exhibit this loss of optimality at high - snr , and should be preferred to the unweighted ls analyzed in this paper .",
    "this effect is clearly illustrated in figure  [ fig_mlvsls ] , where we present a comparison between the standard deviation of the ls and ml methods derived from numerical simulations in the very high snr regime ( where the gap between cr and the ls is most significant ) .",
    "motivated by these results , a detailed analysis of the ml method will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
