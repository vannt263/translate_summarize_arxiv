    "the bose - einstein condensation of low density atomic samples @xcite provides one with a new paradigm in many - body theory , atomic physics , quantum optics , and nonlinear dynamics . below the critical temperature ,",
    "condensates are described to an excellent degree of accuracy by a scalar nonlinear schrdinger equation , the gross - pitaevskii equation describing the dynamics of the condensate wave function @xcite .",
    "the elementary excitations of the condensate evaluated from a bogoliubov linearization about the condensate solution are in good qualitative agreement with experiments @xcite , and so is the hartree mean - field energy of the system @xcite .",
    "nonlinear schrdinger equations are of course ubiquitous in physics , and have been studied in great detail in the past , in situations from fluid dynamics @xcite to phenomenological models of field theories @xcite and to nonlinear optics @xcite .",
    "they play an important role in the study of pattern formation in beam propagation @xcite , and their soliton solutions find applications in problems such as light propagation in fibers @xcite . from this work",
    ", it is known that the dynamical and stability properties of multicomponent nonlinear schrdinger equations can be vastly different from those of their scalar versions , and lead to a wealth of new effects @xcite .",
    "it would be of considerable interest to generalize these ideas to the case of matter waves and to have multicomponent condensates available .    while it is not generally possible to create two coexisting condensates inside a trap , exceptions are possible , as recently demonstrated in rubidium experiments by the jila group @xcite . however , this coexistence relies on a fortuitous coincidence of the scattering lengths for the two zeeman sublevels involved @xcite , a coincidence that can not be generally counted on .",
    "there are proposals to optically change the s - wave scattering length of ground state atoms @xcite , but whether this can be used to produce coexisting condensates remains to be seen .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to propose and analyze a method by which effective multicomponent condensates can be generated inside a high - q multimode optical resonator .",
    "the cavity photons dress the condensate , very much like atoms can be dressed by electromagnetic fields @xcite , and the various dressed condensate states are coupled , e.g. via an electric dipole interaction .",
    "hence , the condensate inside the cavity should be thought of as a coupled multicomponent system , each component subject to a nonlinear equation , and in addition coupled to its neighboring components .",
    "in contrast to the situation involving two ( or more ) atomic species or levels , the coupling between the various components of the dressed condensate is linear , rather than resulting from collisions and hence nonlinear .",
    "nonetheless , we submit that this method permits to generate and study `` coupled condensates '' in a controlable  and at least in principle simple  way .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section ii defines our model and uses a hartree variational principle to derive coupled nonlinear schrdinger equations describing the evolution of a dressed condensate in a two - mode cavity .",
    "section iii specializes to the case where only one photon is present inside the resonator , and thus only two dressed condensate components are of importance . in that case , the problem reduces to the so - called discrete self - trapping equations for a dimer familiar in nonlinear physics .",
    "these equations are integrable in free space , but not in the trap situation that we consider here .",
    "we solve them approximately in the thomas - fermi approximation and study the spectrum of elementary excitations .",
    "we predict the onset of instabilities in the system , and compare these analytical results with an exact numerical solution of the equations .",
    "finally , section iv is a summary and conclusion .",
    "our model system comprises a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) which interacts with two counter - propagating modes supported by a high - q ring cavity .",

    "we neglect the detailed mode structure of the field in the transverse plane perpendicular to the optical - axis @xmath9 , assuming that it is homogeneous on the spatial scale of the bec , and that it is unaffected by its presence .",
    "the atoms comprising the condensate are confined by an external trapping potential @xmath10 which binds the atoms on a sub - wavelength scale along the longitudinal axis @xmath9 .",
    "in addition they interact with the cavity field , which induces transitions between the ground and excited electronic states .",

    "we consider the case of large atom - field detuning for which the excited atomic state can be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "this results in the following effective single - particle hamiltonian ( see appendix a for details ) involving only the ground atomic state @xmath22 the four terms involving field mode operators in this effective hamiltonian describe virtual transitions involving the absorption of a photon from mode 1 followed by re - emission into mode 1 , the same but for mode 2 , absorption of a photon from mode 1 followed by re - emission into mode 2 , and vice versa .",
    "the last two of these processes are allowed since the length @xmath23 of the bec is taken to be less than an optical wavelength , yielding an associated momentum uncertainty @xmath24 .",
    "hence the momentum deficit involved in the transfer of a photon from one direction to the other around the cavity is within the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "we also note that the effective hamiltonian conserves the total number of photons @xmath25 which is then a good quantum number .",
    "proceeding now to include many - body interactions , the second - quantized hamiltonian describing our system is @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes a full set of quantum numbers , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the usual atomic field annihilation and creation operators , which for bosonic atoms satisfy the commutation relations @xmath30 = \\delta(\\ell-\\ell ' ) .",

    "the hartree approximation is therefore strictly valid at zero temperature , and for a weakly interacting bose gas as assumed here , so that the condensate fraction is close to unity @xcite . accordingly",

    "( [ sysbog ] ) is not available , to the best of our knowledge . to proceed we therefore use the consequence of the thomas - fermi approximation @xmath99 , which means that the profile of the dressed state solution is broad compared to the characteristic length scale of the trapping potential",

    ", the spectrum of the normal modes for the in - phase dressed - state is @xmath107 there are again two branches in the excitation spectrum , one of which , @xmath108 can become unstable , that is , @xmath106 can assume imaginary values .",
    "in particular , the region of instability is defined in terms of the index @xmath109 of the linear oscillator mode as @xmath110 a detailed analysis of the eigenmodes corresponding to the elementary excitations reveals that for the in - phase dressed state the unstable excitations have normal modes that are @xmath111 out of phase , that is , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , whereas the system is stable against symmetric perturbations , @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "this means that as the instability develops , the density profiles of the @xmath77 and @xmath78 components should display modulations which are @xmath111 out of phase .    from this analysis",
    "we can also estimate the index @xmath116 for the mode of largest growth rate , that is , the most negative value of @xmath117 the requirement @xmath118 then leads to the condition @xmath119 where the nearest integer value should be taken for @xmath116 .",
    "the corresponding growth rate is readily found to be @xmath120 .      in this section",
    "we present sample numerical simulations of the development of the predicted instability for the in - phase dressed state bec .",
    "the aim of these simulations is to validate the approximate stability analysis of the previous section , and to put its predictions in context using a concrete example .",
    "we have solved the coupled gross - pitaevskii equations ( [ sys3 ] ) using a standard beam propagation technique for the initial conditions @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the in - phase ground state . in the initial condition ( [ incon ] ) the parameter @xmath123 is included to provide a slight deviation from the exact in - phase solution .",
    "this deviation from the exact ground state of the trapping potential can be viewed as a wave packet of the normal modes , which triggers any instability present in the system .",
    "we numerically generated the in - phase ground state solution by evolving the thomas - fermi ground state ( 22 ) , which represents a symmetric perturbation of the system and is hence stable , until the density profile reached a steady - state .",
    "this evolution of the initial thomas - fermi solution towards the actual ground state occurs since in our numerical scheme an absorber is placed at the spatial grid boundaries to avoid unphysical reflections of high spatial frequencies : the absorber removes the high spatial frequencies present in the thomas - fermi solution leaving behind the actual ground state solution for which the absorber has a negligible effect .",
    "for the numerical simulations presented here we have set @xmath124 , and thus @xmath125 , so the approximations employed here should be valid .",
    "figure 1 shows the density profile @xmath126 for @xmath127 ( solid line ) and @xmath128 ( dashed line ) , and @xmath129 so there is no coupling . in this case",
    "the density profile remains close to the initial profile with no sign of any density modulations appearing , meaning that the system is stable against density oscillations .",
    "figure 2 shows the evolution of the central densities @xmath130 and @xmath131 for @xmath132 .",
    "initially , the densities show modulations resulting from the beating of the normal modes excited in the initial state , but this is followed by a region of exponential growth for one component and decay for the other .",
    "this is where the excitation of largest growth rate is expected to be dominant , and the predictions of the linear stability analysis can be tested . in particular , for the parameters used here we find @xmath133 from eq .",
    "( [ mumax ] ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the density profiles @xmath134 ( dotted line ) and @xmath135 ( dashed line ) , along with the initial profile ( solid line ) for comparison .",
    "here we have plotted the densities for @xmath136 in the region of exponential growth and density modulations signaling an instability are clearly seen . in particular , the density oscillations of the two components are @xmath111 out of phase as predicted , and the oscillations correspond precisely to those expected for the most unstable mode with @xmath133 .    these results clearly show that the linear coupling and associated quantum superposition of the system wave function have a large effect : in contrast to the stable bec shown in fig . 1 for @xmath137 , the introduction of linear coupling via a single cavity photon is sufficient to render the @xmath35-atom condensate spatially unstable .",
    "the density profiles shown in fig .",
    "3 are appropriate if we determine which cavity mode the photon occupies .",
    "for example , @xmath126 is the density given that there is one photon in mode 1 and none in mode 2 .",
    "in contrast , if no determination is made of which mode the photon occupies then the density profile is @xmath138 , and this is shown in fig . 4 where the density oscillations remain but with sufficiently reduced contrast .",
    "here we see the possibility for a delayed choice experiment with a many - body system : imagine that the system is left to evolve and then released from the trap after which it falls under gravity and its density profile is measured .",
    "if we measure which mode the photon occupies as the bec is dropping we expect the large contrast density oscillations , whereas if we do nt measure which mode the photon occupies we expect the low contrast density oscillations .",
    "in addition , the decision whether to measure the cavity photon or not can in principle be made after the bec has left the cavity when the bec and field no longer interact , thus providing a delayed choice experiment .",
    "care should be taken , however , that the time at which the measurement is performed is within the linear growth range illustrated in fig .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced the concept of dressed condensates , which permit to create a coupled , multicomponent macroscopic quantum system whose dynamics can be vastly different from that of a bare condensate . a number of immediate extensions of the ideas presented here can readily be envisioned .",
    "for example , one can easily imagine ways to create three - component systems , entangled condensates , etc .",
    "such systems will allow one to extend many of the ideas related to measurement theory that have been developed in recent years in quantum optics to truly macroscopic quantum systems .",
