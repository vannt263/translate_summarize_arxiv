    "after molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath0 ) , the molecules h@xmath0o , co , co@xmath0 , and ch@xmath5oh , are among the most abundant in the interstellar medium , as it has been inferred from observations of the gas and solid phase ( mumma & charnley 2011 , and references therein ) .",
    "the main elements , and their corresponding isotopes , which compose most volatile molecules in the interstellar medium , are h : d , @xmath6c:@xmath2c , @xmath7n:@xmath4n , and @xmath8o:@xmath9o:@xmath10o .",
    "deuterium enrichment can be the result of low temperature gas - grain reactions because of the differences in zero - point energies between deuterated and non - deuterated species ( wilson et al .",
    "observation toward prestellar cores indicates , in gas phase , that abundances of singly deuterated molecules are typically higher than the cosmic atomic d / h ratio of 1.5 @xmath11 10@xmath12(linsky 2003 ) , also , doubly and triply deuterated molecules have been observed with d / h ratios reaching @xmath13 30 % for d@xmath0co and @xmath13 3 % for cd@xmath5oh ( see , ceccarelli et al .",

    "deuterated methanol molecules were detected in the gas phase toward low - mass class 0 protostars with abundances up to about 60 % relative to ch@xmath5oh ( parise et al .",
    "d@xmath0o has been detected toward the solar - type protostar iras 16293 - 2422 ( butner et al .",
    "2007 ; vastel et al . 2010 ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the multiply deuterated isotopologues of h@xmath5@xmath14 can efficiently transfer deuterons to other neutral molecules in very cold ( @xmath15 20 k ) gas depleted of its co ( because the co molecules are frozen onto refractory dust grain mantles ) .",
    "isotopic substitution often alters the chemical and physical properties of atoms and molecules , resulting in differences in absorption spectra and reaction rates .",
    "therefore , measurements of the isotopic compositions of various species can be used to interpret the physico - chemical histories and the chemical reaction pathways in these environments .",
    "in particular , isotope effects in the non - dissociative photoionization region of molecular nitrogen play an important role in isotopic fractionation in planetary atmospheres and other environments ( e.g. , interstellar molecular clouds , the solar nebula , and in the atmospheres of earth , mars , and titan ) in which n@xmath0 and vuv radiation are present ( see , croteau et al .",
    "2011 , and references therein ) .",
    "carbon dioxide is an important constituent of quiescent and star forming molecular clouds ( gerakines et al .",
    "1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "it is primarily present in the solid state ( van dishoeck et al .",
    "the @xmath2co@xmath0 isotope has been detected with a two orders of magnitude lower abundance with respect to co@xmath0 ( dhendecourt et al .",
    "the stretching band of @xmath2co@xmath0 is an independent and sensitive probe of the ice mantle composition ( boogert et al .",
    "2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "studies in the gas phase have shown that the @xmath6c/@xmath2c ratio increases with galacto - centric radius ( wilson & rood 1994 ; keene et al .",
    "1998 ) . in the solid phase",
    ", the behavior of this ratio agrees with the gas phase studies ( boogert et al .",
    "2000 ) . also , determination of this ratio is an important input for evolutionary models of the galaxy , since @xmath6c is produced by helium burning by massive stars , which can be converted to @xmath2c in the cno cycle of low- and intermediate - mass stars at later times ( boogert et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the average cross section for a certain spectral range are useful when there is no information ( flux , photodesorption rate ) for each specific wavelength within that range .",
    "an example are the photodesorption rate values reported in the literature ( e.g. , berg et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ; muoz caro et al . 2010 ) , which correspond to the full continuum emission spectrum of the hydrogen vuv lamps ( an analog of the secondary uv emission in dense clouds ) . to estimate the photodesorption rate per absorbed photon in that case",
    ", what is used is the average photon energy and the average vuv absorption cross section in the same range .",
    "in addition , these average vuv absorption cross sections allow comparison with previous works that estimated those average values in similar spectral ranges in an indirect way ( i.e. , with no use of vuv spectroscopy ) , see e.g , cottin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "heavy isotopologues , in the context of laboratory astrophysics , are often used to study ice photoprocessing and , in particular ice photodesorption experimentally , to avoid problems with contamination ( e.g. , @xmath2co , @xmath4n@xmath0 ; see oberg et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ; fayolle et al . 2013 ) .",
    "in addition , it is interesting to search for differences in the absorption of these ices compared to those made of light isotopologues .",
    "the estimation of the vuv - absorption cross sections of molecular ice components allows to calculate the photon absorption of icy grains in that range .",
    "in addition , the vuv - absorption spectrum as a function of photon wavelength is required to study the photo - desorption processes over the full photon emission energy range .",
    "it is therefore important to study the physical and chemical properties of molecules containing heavy isotopes .",
    "this study focusses on the isotopic effects observed in the vacuum - ultraviolet ( vuv ) absorption spectra of three of the most abundant inter- and circumstellar species in the solid phase : h@xmath0o , ch@xmath5oh , and co@xmath0 . among the possible isotopologues ,",
    "the fully deuterated ones were selected , d@xmath0o and cd@xmath5od , in addition to @xmath2co@xmath0 .",
    "also @xmath4n@xmath4n , henceforth abbreviated as @xmath4n@xmath0 , was included in our study to explore the isotopic effects in a homonuclear diatomic molecule that was also observed in space ( bergin et al . 2002",
    "; belloche & andr 2003 ) .",
    "two recent papers report the vuv absorption cross sections of the light isotopologues in the ice ( cruz - diaz et al .",
    "2013a , 2013b ) , henceforth referred to as papers i and ii , respectively ) .",
    "the data in paper i and ii were used for comparison to this work . in addition , the vuv absorption spectra of the same molecules in the gas phase were also adapted to illustrate the differences between the gas and the solid phase samples .",
    "the measurements were conducted using the interstellar astrochemistry chamber ( isac ) . this set - up and the standard experimental protocol",
    "were described in detail in @xcite .",
    "isac mainly consists of an ultra - high - vacuum ( uhv ) chamber , with pressure typically in the range p = 3 - 4.0 @xmath11 10@xmath16 mbar at room temperature , where an ice layer is made by deposition of a gas species onto a cold finger at 8 k. the low temperature is achieved by means of a closed - cycle helium cryostat .",
    "the ice sample can be either uv - irradiated or warmed up to room temperature .",
    "the evolution of the solid sample was monitored with _ in situ _ fourier transform infrared ( ftir ) spectroscopy in transmittance and vuv spectroscopy .",
    "the chemical compounds used for the experiments described in this paper were : d@xmath0o(liquid ) , cambridge isotope laboratories , inc ( c.i.l . ) 99.9% ; cd@xmath5od(liquid ) , c.i.l . 99.8% ; @xmath2co@xmath0(gas ) , c.i.l . 99.0% ; and @xmath4n@xmath0(gas ) , c.i.l .",
    "the deposited ice layer was vuv irradiated using a microwave discharged hydrogen flow lamp ( mdhl ) , from opthos instruments .",
    "the source has a uv - flux of @xmath17 @xmath18 s@xmath19 at the sample position , measured by co@xmath3 @xmath20 co actinometry , see @xcite .",
    "the evenson cavity of the mdhl is refrigerated with air .",
    "the vuv spectrum was measured routinely _ in situ _ during the experiments with the use of a mcpherson 0.2 meter focal length vuv monochromator ( model 234/302 ) with a photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) detector equipped with a sodium salicylate window , optimized to operate from 100 - 500 nm ( 11.27 - 2.47 ev ) , with a spectral resolution of 0.4 nm .",
    "the characterization of the mdhl spectrum was previously reported ( chen et al .",
    "2010 ; paper i ) and was discussed in more detail by @xcite .",
    "vuv absorption cross sections were obtained for pure ices composed of d@xmath3o , cd@xmath1od , @xmath2co@xmath0 , and @xmath4n@xmath3 .",
    "these measurements were performed following the procedure described in paper i and summarized below .",
    "the column density of the deposited ice was calculated using ftir spectroscopy in transmittance , according to the formula    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the column density of the ice , @xmath23 the optical depth of the band , @xmath24 the wavenumber differential in cm@xmath19 , and @xmath26 is the band strength in cm molecule@xmath19 .",
    "the vuv absorption cross section was estimated according to the beer - lambert law    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the transmitted intensity for a given wavelength @xmath29 , @xmath30 the incident intensity , @xmath22 is the column density in @xmath18 obtained using eq .  [ 1 ] , and @xmath31 is the vuv absorption cross section in @xmath32 .    for each ice spectrum a series of three measurements was performed : i ) the emission spectrum of the vuv - lamp was measured , to monitor the intensity of the main emission bands , ii ) the emission spectrum transmitted by the mgf@xmath3 substrate window was measured , to monitor its transmittance , and iii ) the emission spectrum transmitted by the substrate window with the deposited ice on top was measured .",
    "the absorption spectrum of the ice corresponds to the spectrum of the substrate with the ice after subtraction of the bare mgf@xmath0 substrate spectrum .    a priori",
    ", the vuv absorption cross section of the ice was not known .",
    "therefore , several measurements for different values of the initial ice column density were performed to improve the spectroscopy .",
    "table  [ table1 ] provides the infrared band positions and band strengths of d@xmath3o , cd@xmath1od , and @xmath2co@xmath0 used to estimate the column density .",
    "solid @xmath4n@xmath3 does not display absorption features in the mid - infrared , therefore the column density of @xmath4n@xmath3 was thus measured using the expression    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the density of the @xmath35 ice , see table  [ table1 ] , @xmath36 is the molar mass of the @xmath35 molecule , @xmath37 is the avogadro constant ( 6.022 @xmath11 10@xmath38 mol@xmath19 ) , and @xmath39 is the ice thickness in cm .",
    "the latter was estimated following the classical interfringe relation    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the refractive index of the ice at deposition temperature , and @xmath42 is the wavenumber difference between two adjacent maxima or minima of the fringes observed in the infrared spectrum of the ice .",
    ".infrared band positions , infrared band strengths ( @xmath26 ) , column density ( @xmath22 ) in ml ( as in previous works , one ml is here defined as 10@xmath4 molecules @xmath18 ) , and refractive index ( @xmath41 ) of the samples used in this work .",

    ", @xmath4n@xmath0 ice seems to be similar or slightly more absorbing than n@xmath0 . for the first time",
    ", we report the vuv absorption cross section as a function of photon energy for d@xmath0o , cd@xmath5od , @xmath2co@xmath0 , and @xmath4n@xmath0 in the solid phase at 8 k.    all four molecules present a shift to shorter wavelengths in their vuv spectrum with respect to their corresponding light isotopologues . deuterated species experience the largest blue - shift among the molecules studied .",
    "this could be expected from previous works on deuterated species in the gas phase , but the shifts measured in the solid phase were larger in comparison .",
    "the average and the integrated vuv absorption cross section values are close for the different isotopologues",
    ". the relatively small variations between isotopologues may only play a minor role in the absorption of vuv radiation in space .",
    "large differences were found between the vuv absorption cross section spectra of solid and gas phase species ( papers i , ii , and ref . therein ; this work ) .",
    "this has important implications for the absorption of vuv photons in dense clouds and circumstellar regions .",
    "there is a clear correspondence between the photodesorption rates measured at different photon energies and the vuv absorption spectrum for the same photon energies .",
    "this indicates that photodesorption of some ice species like n@xmath0 and co is mainly driven by a desorption induced by electronic transition ( diet ) process ( fayolle et al .",
    "2011 , 2013 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the n@xmath0 and @xmath4n@xmath0 ice absorption spectra at photon energies higher than 12.4 ev , where photodesorption is efficient , have not been measured .",
    "but the low photodesorption rates measured at energies below 12 ev by @xcite ( no more than 4 @xmath11 10@xmath43 molecules per incident photon for @xmath4n@xmath0 ice ) is compatible with its low ice absorption cross section , reported here for the same spectral range . in addition , the observed photodesorption occurs in the same spectral range where the absorption bands of fig .",
    "[ 15n2 ] are present .",
    "the lower photodesorption reported by fayolle et al .",
    "2013 for the ly-@xmath44 wavelength at 121.6 nm , 1.5 @xmath11 10@xmath43 molecules per incident photon , coincides with a low absorption in fig .",
    "[ 15n2 ] , and the maximum in the photodesorption occurs approximately at @xmath13 135 nm , where the most intense absorption band is present , see fig .",
    "the photodesorption rate per absorbed photon in that range , @xmath45 , can be estimated as follows @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the total photon flux emitted ( fayolle et al .",
    "2013 reports 3 - 11.5 @xmath11 10@xmath6 photons @xmath18 s@xmath19 , in our experiments this flux is about 2.0 @xmath11 10@xmath7 photons @xmath18 s@xmath19 ) , @xmath49 is the total photon flux absorbed by the ice , @xmath50 is the photon flux emitted at wavelength @xmath29 , @xmath51 is the vuv absorption cross section at the same wavelength , and @xmath22 is the column density of the ice sample .",
    "@xmath52 corresponds to a photodesorption rate of @xmath15 4 @xmath11 10@xmath43 molecules per incident photon in the spectral range below 12.4 ev for @xmath22 = 60 @xmath11 10@xmath4 @xmath18 ( 60 monolayers ) from @xcite , while the average absorption cross section for @xmath4n@xmath0 ice that we measured in that range is @xmath31 = 8.7 @xmath53 1.9 @xmath11 10@xmath54 @xmath32 .",
    "the resulting photodesorption rate is thus quite high , @xmath45 @xmath15 7.7 molecules per absorbed photon , meaning that a very small fraction of the incident photons are absorbed in the ice but each absorbed photon led to the photodesorption of about 7.7 molecules on average ( this in fact is the maximum value because @xcite measured photodesorption rates , @xmath52 , that _ do not exceed _",
    "4 @xmath11 10@xmath43 molecules per incident photon ) .    in the case of co ice deposited also at 15 k",
    ", it was found that only the photons absorbed in the top 5 monolayers led to photodesorption with a rate of 2.5 co molecules per absorbed photon in those 5 monolayers ( based on muoz caro et al .",
    "2010 , but using an average cross section of co ice of 4.7 @xmath53 0.4 @xmath11 10@xmath55 @xmath56 adapted from paper i ) .",
    "this value for co ice is about 3.1 times lower than the maximum estimated above for the 60 ml of the @xmath4n@xmath0 ice experiment of @xcite .",
    "a more direct comparison between n@xmath0 and co ice photodesorption could be made if the number of n@xmath0 monolayers closer to the ice surface that truly contribute to the photodesorption was known ( in the case of co ice these are @xmath13 5 monolayers , this value has not been estimated for n@xmath0 ice and therefore the values of @xmath52 and @xmath45 correspond to the total ice column density of 60 monolayers in the experiment of fayolle et al .",
    "2013 ) . with this uncertainty still remaining",
    ", we can conclude that if the vuv absorption cross section of each specific ice composition is taken into account , it is possible to know what is the efficiency of the photodesorption per absorbed photon ; in the case of n@xmath0 and co , for vuv photon energies that do not lead to direct dissociation of the molecules in the ice , these values are higher than unity .",
    "the values of @xmath45 > 1 and the fact that the photons absorbed in ice monolayers deeper than the top monolayers ( up to 5 for co ) can lead to a photodesorption event , indicate that the excess photon energy is transmitted to neighboring molecules in the ice within a certain range ( this range may correspond to about 5 monolayers in the case of co ice , e.g. , rakhovskaia et al .",
    "1995 ; berg et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ; muoz caro et al . 2010 ) ; if a molecule on the ice surface receives sufficient energy , it may photodesorbs ( muoz caro et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "it should also be noted that ice photodesorption experiments performed with a continuum emission source ( like the mdhl ) , mimicking the secondary vuv field in dense cloud interiors , can lead to photodesorption rates that are intrinsically different from those obtained in experiments using a monochromatic source ( generally provided by a synchrotron beam ) , we refer to @xcite for the case of co ice photodesorption .",
    "this work , along with papers i and ii , provides essential data to attempt a more quantitative study of vuv absorption of molecules forming ice mantles , and the photon processes involved : photo - processing leading to destruction of molecules and formation of new species , and photo - desorption of molecules in the ice that are ejected to the gas phase .",

    "<S> this paper reports the first measurements of solid - phase vacuum - ultraviolet ( vuv ) absorption cross sections of heavy isotopologues present in icy dust grain mantles of dense interstellar clouds and cold circumstellar environments . </S>",
    "<S> pure ices composed of d@xmath0o , cd@xmath1od , @xmath2co@xmath3 , and @xmath4n@xmath4n were deposited at 8 k , a value similar to the coldest dust temperatures in space . </S>",
    "<S> the column density of the ice samples was measured _ in situ _ by infrared spectroscopy in transmittance . </S>",
    "<S> vuv spectra of the ice samples were collected in the 120 - 160 nm ( 10.33 - 7.74 ev ) range using a commercial microwave discharged hydrogen flow lamp as the vuv source . prior to this work , we have recently submitted a similar study of the light isotopologues ( cruz - diaz et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2013a ; cruz - diaz et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2013b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the vuv spectra are compared to those of the light isotopologues in the solid phase , and to the gas phase spectra of the same molecules . </S>",
    "<S> our study is expected to improve very significantly the models that estimate the vuv absorption of ice mantles in space , which have often used the available gas phase data as an approximation of the absorption cross sections of the molecular ice components . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that this work has also important implications for the estimation of the photodesorption rates per absorbed photon in the ice .    </S>",
