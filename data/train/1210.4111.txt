    "the theory of stochastic thermodynamics provides a consistent description of nonequilibrium thermodynamics for classical systems weakly coupled to their environments and described by markovian dynamics @xcite . in recent years",
    "fundamental characteristics of classical thermodynamics have been put under scrutiny in the quantum realm where a proper formulation of nonequilibrium thermodynamics seems a much harder task . in particular when considering low temperatures and non - vanishing couplings various difficulties arise , some of which are already present at equilibrium . an ubiquitous exactly solvable model to address these questions",
    "is the quantum brownian motion ( qbm ) model .",
    "it consists of a system with hamiltonian @xmath0 ( often an harmonic oscillator ) bi - linearly coupled via a term denoted @xmath1 to a bath of harmonic oscillators with hamiltonian @xmath2 .",
    "the total hamiltonian is thus of the form @xmath3 . in this model ,",
    "when the total system is initially in canonical equilibrium @xmath4 , the clausius formulation of the second law seems to be violated for a quasi - static change of the mass or of the frequency of the central oscillator @xcite . in this case , the heat flow is defined as the change in the averaged central system hamiltonian due to the bath and is found to be larger than the temperature times the change in the system entropy , defined as the von neumann entropy of the central system . to remain consistent with these definitions , work and free energy",
    "are also defined in terms of the system hamiltonian and as a result the thompson formulation of the second law is also violated @xcite .",
    "more work can be extracted from the system than the change in its free energy .",
    "one also intriguingly finds that , when the total system is in @xmath5 , the behavior of the heat capacity of the system at low temperature depends on its definition  @xcite .",
    "also , the von neumann entropy of the central oscillator does not vanish at zero temperature while the equilibrium entropy of the total system ( which coincides with the von neumann entropy of the total system ) does .",
    "these phenomena can be ascribed to quantum correlations between the central system and the bath @xcite .",
    "various attempts have been made in order to overcome these difficulties .",
    "some of them incorporate in thompson s formulation of the second law the work contribution required to couple the system to the bath at zero @xcite or arbitrary temperatures @xcite .",
    "others introduce different notions of effective temperature @xcite .",
    "ultimately , many of the difficulties are related to the fact that the equilibrium density matrix of the central oscillator is not the familiar canonical distribution @xmath6 defined in terms of the central system hamiltonian as is often the case in weak - coupling theories .    in this paper , we want to investigate the slightly different problem of transient relaxation to equilibrium in the qbm model .",
    "this means that we initially place the central oscillator in a nonequilibrium state and put it in contact with its bath at equilibrium . due to the interaction",
    ", the two parts of the system will exchange energy and if the bath is sufficiently large , the central oscillator will asymptotically reach an equilibrium state .",
    "for such a process we would like to identify a meaningful notion of entropy production . in stochastic thermodynamics",
    "the nonequilibrium version of the second law states that for such a relaxation process the entropy production is equal to the change in system entropy ( which is identified with the shannon entropy of the system ) minus the heat exchanged with the bath divided by the bath temperature .",
    "furthermore the entropy production can be proved to be an always positive quantity which only vanishes at equilibrium . for quantum systems",
    "the shannon entropy is replaced by the von neumann entropy of the system @xmath7 .",
    "an attempt to define entropy production for the qbm model was proposed in  @xcite and relied on defining the heat exchanged with the bath in terms of the system hamiltonian ( by integrating @xmath8 ) but with non satisfactory results , since a negative entropy production rate was obtained for non - vanishing system - bath coupling strength .",
    "a more satisfactory definition of entropy production has been recently introduced by esposito , lindenberg and van den  broeck  @xcite ( denoted here by elb ) in the form @xmath9 , where the heat is now defined as minus the energy change in the bath ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this quantum entropy production is positive definite even for finite bath sizes , notwithstanding recurrences .",
    "this definition applies on the assumption that the central system and the bath have uncorrelated density matrices at the initial time .    in this paper",
    ", we compare this definition of entropy production @xmath11 with a new definition @xmath12 , inspired by the one introduced in  @xcite in the context of markovian master equations .",
    "the corresponding heat definition is expressed in term of the averaged change of an effective hamiltonian which reduces to the system hamiltonian @xmath13 in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "we evaluate analytically both expressions of the entropy production for the qbm model and evaluate their difference .",
    "we consider only gaussian initial conditions , both for the bath and for the central oscillator , what guarantees that the density matrix remains gaussian at all times .",
    "we find that @xmath11 is positive definite but can present oscillations while @xmath14 is positive definite and has a positive time derivative only in the markovian high - temperature or weak - coupling limits .",
    "the difference between the two definitions sensibly depends on the coupling .",
    "we also study the behavior of the entropy production for finite - size thermal baths , where poincar recurrences characterize the time evolution of the system . the convergence towards a continuous relaxing behavior is studied as a function of the system size .",
    "it turns out that a lorentzian , rather than uniform , sampling of oscillation frequencies of the bath guarantees a better convergence .",
    "finally the evolution the von  neumann entropy of the bath is studied .",
    "it is found that , for fixed initial conditions , its asymptotic value does not depend on the coupling in the classical limit while it does in the quantum regime .",
    "however , in both cases the kullback - leibler divergence between the density matrix of the bath at time @xmath15 and at canonical equilibrium depends considerably on the coupling , making the usual approximation of the ideal bath problematic .      in section  [ model ] the quantum brownian motion model",
    "is introduced and solved .",
    "our protocol is defined in subsection  [ ic ] and the evolution of the system is described in section  [ me ] via its wigner quasi - distribution function . the approach to the thermodynamic limit",
    "is described in section  [ therm_limit ] .",
    "the different definitions of the entropy production are spelled out in section  [ def2law ] , while their explicit expressions for our model are reported in section  [ results ] .",
    "section  [ poi_rec ] is devoted to a study of the model with a finite - sized bath , where poincar recurrencies characterize its behavior .",
    "a discussion of the bath entropy , correlation entropy and of the distance of the bath density operator from its canonical form is reported in section  [ bath_entropy ] . in section  [ conclusions ]",
    "we conclude and summarize our results .",
    "a few technical details are relegated in several appendices .",

    "since the coupling strength ( [ u_strenght ] ) is an even meromorphic function , the integrals appearing in ( [ cm_sist ] ) can be evaluated by a contour integration in the complex plane .",
    "complete expression for the thermal correlation matrix in the large cut - off limit , which are exploited in the following for the calculation of the entropies , were derived in  @xcite and are reported in  [ num - cov - matr ] .",
    "their quantum features are due to the presence of the function @xmath145 , whose poles at @xmath146 with @xmath147 any integer , give rise to the thermal transients , i.e. , to terms which vanish on a time scale of order @xmath148 .",
    "these terms are also responsible for the time - dependence of the diffusion coefficients of the master equation  @xcite . in the high - temperature classical limit ,",
    "where @xmath145 approaches @xmath149 , all the thermal transients vanish and the expressions of the covariance matrix simplify .",
    "one can deduce from equations ( [ m_prop ] ) , ( [ w_s_fourier ] ) and ( [ a_local ] ) that , since @xmath150 , in the thermodynamic limit the system eventually loses all information on its initial conditions , and its distribution assumes the characteristic gaussian form corresponding to the late - time thermal covariance matrix , as described in the next subsection .",
    "an important feature of this model is the presence of initial slips in the momentum average , in the non - thermal part of the averaged square momentum and of the correlation between @xmath151 and @xmath152 . using the local propagator ( [ a_local ] ) from @xmath56 , implies neglecting an initial evolution of the system during a short time of order @xmath153 , in which the central oscillator is subjected to an initial kick  @xcite .",
    "one can easily observe , indeed , that @xmath154 our description will thus only be valid for @xmath131 .",
    "the effect of initial slips both on the moments and on the definitions of entropy production are discussed in [ sec : slips ] .      in the thermodynamical limit it is possible to evaluate the long - time behavior of the diffusion coefficients and of the covariance thermal matrix .",
    "they are related by @xmath155 thus the anomalous diffusion coefficients survive , since the right - hand side of the first equation of ( [ dqp ] ) does not vanish .",
    "this implies that equipartition does not hold in the general quantum case .",
    "interestingly , as observed in  @xcite , one obtains @xmath156 namely that the stationary form of the central oscillator density matrix at @xmath157 equals the traced canonical equilibrium one of the total system : @xmath158 this does not mean of course that the total system equilibrates : @xmath159  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown in  @xcite that @xmath160 where the equilibrium effective hamiltonian @xmath161 is given by @xmath162 the effective frequency @xmath163 and mass @xmath164 are respectively given by @xmath165 expressions for @xmath166 and @xmath167 can be found in @xcite and  @xcite , and are reported in ( [ q2-eq],[p2-eq ] ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that the traced canonical equilibrium density matrix ( [ rho_st_eq ] ) can be equivalently written in the form @xcite : @xmath168 where an hamiltonian of mean force @xmath169 has been introduced , which differs from the effective @xmath161 by the additive constant @xmath170 .",
    "both partition functions have a well known analytical expression @xcite . for the practical purpose of evaluating the breuer entropy flow ( [ ds_e_eq ] ) we will use the effective hamiltonian .",
    "however we emphasize that the use of the mean force hamiltonian leads to exactly the same entropy production ( since only the density matrix is involved ) and heat flow ( since only differences in energies are considered ) .",

    "the poised density matrix is constant in time and , if it is unique , coincides with the stationary one , which in turn corresponds to the asymptotic form of the density operator @xmath189 it follows from ( [ inequal ] ) and ( [ allthesame ] ) that the time derivative of @xmath12 is also positive : @xmath190 however , this result does not hold in general when @xmath182 depends on @xmath15 .    because in our model @xmath191 ( [ rho_st_eq ] ) , following breuer and petruccione @xcite we introduce the following definition of the entropy production : @xmath192 this expression has a straightforward physical interpretation , since it can be rewritten as @xmath193 i.e. , as the difference between the entropy change @xmath194 , and the entropy flow @xmath195 identified by the variation of the averaged effective hamiltonian of the central system : @xmath196 where @xmath161 is defined in ( [ h_s_eq ] ) .",

    "one observes in figure  [ bathent_uni_lor_q ] that in the quantum case the asymptotic value of the bath entropy change appears to grow with the coupling , which could be an effect of the entanglement or quantum correlations between the bath and the system .",
    "the dependence on the coupling is apparently weaker than that exhibited by the entropy flow .",
    "this means that also here the kullback - leibler distance between @xmath380 and @xmath381 is relevant and strongly increases with the coupling . due to the quantum contribution in the interaction term",

    "in this paper we studied the thermodynamic description of a process of transient relaxation in the qbm model where a central harmonic oscillator initially prepared in a gaussian nonequilibrium state is bi - linearly coupled with a bath of harmonic oscillators initially prepared at equilibrium .",
    "we compared two ways of defining entropy production during the ensuing relaxation process of the central oscillator .",
    "both definitions are expressed as the difference between the change is the von neumann entropy of the system minus an heat divided by the temperature of the reservoir .",
    "the ` elb ' one is based on defining this heat as minus the energy change in the bath and thus has a straightforward physical interpretation , while the ` poised ' one ( beyond non - markovian transients ) defines heat in a less transparent way in term of the change in an effective `` mean force '' hamiltonian .",
    "both expressions are positive by definition but in a general non - markovian quantum regime they both may exhibit oscillations .",
    "however , in the markovian limit , while the ` elb ' may still exhibit oscillations , the ` poised ' one becomes a monotonically increasing function of time .",
    "the two definitions coincide for vanishing coupling but we have shown that for finite coupling the ` elb ' is always larger than the ` poised ' one . their difference contains the expectation value of the interaction hamiltonian and can thus be made arbitrarily large . in the low - temperature limit the contribution due to the quantum corrections in the interaction term can make this difference order of magnitudes larger than in the classical case .",
    "finally , we showed that in the classical over - damped regime the ` poised ' one converges to the entropy production defined in stochastic thermodynamics .",
    "we numerically studied the exact dynamics of our system for a finite number of oscillators in the bath . using two different samplings of the bath frequencies , a uniform and a lorentzian ones . in both cases the period of the poincar recurrences increases with growing density of bath frequencies but the lorentzian sampling guarantees a faster convergence to the continuum limit curves as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "finally , we numerically studied the evolution of the von neumann entropy of the bath which results from the relaxation process of the central oscillator .",
    "this enabled us to calculate the evolution of the system - bath correlation entropy ( or minus the mutual information ) and the kullback - leibler divergence between the bath density matrix at time @xmath15 and its initial thermal equilibrium form .",
    "we observed that for a given initial condition of the central oscillator , the asymptotic value of the bath entropy change does not depend on the coupling in the classical limit , while it slightly does in the quantum regime . in the limit of vanishing coupling strength the correlation entropy vanishes ,",
    "what means that the change in the von neumann entropy of the bath becomes equal to minus the change in the central system entropy .",
    "we also observed that the kullback - leibler divergence of the bath density matrix never vanishes , thus indicating that the assumption of an ideal bath which always remains at equilibrium is not satisfied . as expected , this divergence grows significantly with the coupling , as the elb expression of the entropy production does .",
    "while our study revealed important features in the qbm model , it also indicates that no definite formulation of a consistent thermodynamics of out - of - equilibrium quantum systems in presence of non - vanishing coupling with the bath is yet available .",
