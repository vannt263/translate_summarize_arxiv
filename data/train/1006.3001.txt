    "the following frequently used feature of spectra of periodic second order ordinary differential operators in @xmath4 is well known and follows from the standard floquet theory @xcite : all edges of the spectral bands of such an operator on the whole axis can be found by considering the spectra of periodic and antiperiodic boundary value problems . in the multi - dimensional case ,",
    "the role of the periodic and anti - periodic problems is played by symmetry points of the brillouin zone .",
    "thus , until recently , there had been a rather wide spread belief that these were the only possible locations of the spectral edges .",
    "this belief was in most cases confirmed by numerics done for crystalline or photonic crystal media .",
    "it was , however , the experience of numerical analysts that in general this claim should be incorrect .",
    "this was shown analytically to be indeed the case in @xcite . however , after that , claims have been encountered that in the case of a single periodicity ( i.e. , with respect to the lattice @xmath2 ) , the spectral edges do occur at the periodic and anti - periodic spectra only . in this work",
    "we show that even in the simplest case of quantum graphs this is not true .",
    "namely , it is shown in theorem [ t : main ] that this is indeed true if the graph consists of a @xmath3 chain of finite graphs connected by single edges , while if the connections are formed by two or more edges , the spectral edges can already occur away from the periodic and anti - periodic spectra .",
    "thus , one has to be careful drawing conclusions about @xmath3-like spectral behavior when the medium is @xmath3-periodic .",

    "this means that the space of ( bounded ) solutions of the equation @xmath57 on @xmath5 is more than two - dimensional .",

    "re - defining @xmath58 as being equal to zero everywhere to the left of @xmath54 , one has a legitimate bounded solution , which we will denote by @xmath58 again .",
    "then the linear hull of the right shifts of @xmath58 is infinitely dimensional .",

    "suppose that @xmath46 is a band edge , i.e. an extremum of a band function @xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath64 , where @xmath50 is the set defined in the lemma , then the statement ( i ) of the lemma claims that this value @xmath46 is attained at all values of quasi - momentum @xmath47 , in particular for @xmath65 and @xmath31 that correspond to the anti - periodic and periodic problems .    let now @xmath51 .",
    "then the statement ( iii ) of the lemma implies that the corresponding value of @xmath47 can not be in the interior @xmath66 of the segment @xmath52 $ ] .",

    "one sees that the minimum of the third branch , as well as the maximum of the second one are attained inside the segment , and thus not at the points @xmath31 or @xmath65 .",
    "this numerical observation can be confirmed , as in @xcite , by a somewhat tedious explicit calculation of the dispersion relation and elementary analysis of its behavior .",
    "again , as in @xcite , one shows that this fact about the band functions of the discrete operator @xmath83 , in the case of all edges having equal length implies the same conclusion for the quantum graph hamiltonian @xmath19 on @xmath5 .",
    "this provides the required counter - example for @xmath67 .",
    "it is easy to figure out that now one can create examples of this kind for any @xmath45 , just by adding an unrelated structure to the example above .",

    "such compactly supported solutions are known not to exist for the second order elliptic operators .",
    "2 .   various spectral investigations and applications of periodic quantum graphs can be found , for instance , in @xcite ( see also references in these works ) .",
