    "the layered ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 is a peculiar example because of its highly unusual transport behaviors intimately related to the complicating magnetic properties .",
    "ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 consists of alternate stacking of two types of layered subsystems with different @xmath13-axis parameter ( fig .",

    "the anomalous charge transport of this compound is clearly seen in the non - monotonic temperature variations of the electrical resistivity and the seebeck coefficient @xcite , but an underlying origin for these behaviors remains unclear .",
    "for instance , below @xmath14  k , the resistivity increases with decreasing temperature like an insulator while the seebeck coefficient shows a metallic behavior , which has been discussed in terms of the variable range hopping @xcite , quantum criticality @xcite , and pseudogap opening @xcite associated with a spin - density - wave ( sdw ) formation @xcite . at higher temperature",
    ", the resistivity shows a fermi - liquid behavior varying as @xmath15 up to the coherence temperature @xmath16  k , above which an incoherent bad - metal state is realized .",
    "the seebeck coefficient reaches a large value of 130  @xmath17v / k at around 150  k , and becomes almost temperature independent up to 400  k , as described within the modified heikes formula in which the spin and orbital degrees of freedom of correlated co @xmath10 electrons are involved @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the seebeck coefficient again increases with increasing temperature above 400  k , suggested to be associated with a spin - state crossover @xcite , but the high - temperature spin - state nature of ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 remains puzzling @xcite .",
    "note that the similar issue regarding an excited spin state is greatly debated in the perovskite lacoo@xmath0 @xcite .",

    "the physical properties of polycrystalline samples of isovalent rh - substituted ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 have been recently examined for this purpose @xcite , however , the polycrystalline samples have an unavoidable extrinsic effect on the charge transport such as the boundary scattering . also note that the anisotropy of the resistivity in the parent compound is significantly large @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to experimentally investigate how an extended rh 4@xmath19 orbital affects the transport properties of ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 using single - crystalline samples .",
    "as claimed in the previous polycrystalline study @xcite , in the low - temperature fermi - liquid regime , the @xmath8 value in the resistivity is reduced by rh substitution , indicating that an electron - electron correlation effect is weakened by rh @xmath9 electrons with broad orbitals .",
    "we find that , in contrast to such a weak correlation effect , the low - temperature seebeck coefficient is unexpectedly enhanced in the rh - substituted single crystals , which may attribute to an enlargement of the pseudogap in the rh - substituted samples associated with the short - range order of sdw . in the incoherent transport regime above room temperature , the resistivity is reduced by rh substitution , which also stems from the extended @xmath20 orbitals of rh @xmath9 electrons with light effective mass .",
    "the seebeck coefficient of the rh - substituted single crystals is found to become almost temperature - independent at high temperatures , qualitatively understood from the spin state of rh ions , which favors the low - spin state owing to a large crystal field splitting for the @xmath9 electrons .",

    "figure 3(a ) shows the temperature variations of the electrical resistivity measured along the in - plane direction . around room temperature ,",
    "the in - plane resistivity is about 4  m@xmath43 cm for all the samples , which is the same as the single - crystalline result of the parent compound @xcite .",
    "below room temperature it is largely increased with increasing rh content @xmath3 . for @xmath44 samples ,",
    "the resistivity decreases with decreasing temperature down to around 100  k and then shows an upturn towards lower temperatures . in the metal - like regions around 120  k ,",
    "the resistivity exhibits a fermi - liquid behavior varying as @xmath15 , and the @xmath8 value decreases with rh content @xmath3 as displayed in the inset of fig .",
    "this behavior is also reported in the previous study on the polycrystalline samples @xcite , although the absolute value is quite different because of the single - crystalline nature in the present study .",
    "since @xmath8 can be scaled to @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the effective mass @xcite , this result indicates that the effective mass becomes small with rh substitutions , as is naturally understood from a weak correlation effect of rh @xmath9 electrons compared with co @xmath10 electrons . for @xmath4 sample ,",
    "such a fermi - liquid behavior is no longer observed .",
    "in contrast to the low - temperature results , the resistivity decreases with increasing rh content above room temperature .",
    "the resistivity is less than 2  m@xmath43 cm for @xmath4 sample at 600  k , which is beneficial for oxide thermoelectrics at high temperatures as discussed later . in the parent compound",
    ", the resistivity shows a broad maximum around 500  k and then decreases with heating . with increasing rh content , the broad peak shifts to the lower temperature , and disappears for @xmath4 sample , in which the resistivity shows an insulating behavior in the whole temperature range we measured .",
    "we infer that such an insulating behavior is ascribed not to the carrier concentration , which is essentially constant above room temperature , but to the mobility , as will also be discussed in the results of the seebeck coefficient .",
    "such a nonmetallic resistivity due to the mobility has also been observed in several oxide materials @xcite .",
    "figure 3(b ) displays the temperature dependence of the in - plane seebeck coefficient .",
    "below room temperature , the seebeck coefficient slightly but systematically changes with rh content ; in particular , below 100  k where the seebeck coefficient shows a metallic behavior , it is considerably enhanced by rh substitution .",
    "the present results are distinct from the previous report using polycrystalline samples which shows that rh substitution does not affect the seebeck coefficient @xcite , probably attributed to an extrinsic effect of averaging large transport anisotropy in the polycrystalline samples . above room temperature ,",
    "the enhancement of the seebeck coefficient seen in the parent compound is significantly suppressed with rh substitution . for @xmath4 sample , the seebeck coefficient becomes almost temperature independent up to 650  k , where the heikes formula with a constant carrier density looks applicable .",
    "let us discuss an origin of the transport behaviors in this system .",
    "we first focus on the low - temperature upturn of the resistivity coexisting with a metallic seebeck coefficient below 100  k. although it has been often discussed in terms of variable range hopping due to carrier localization @xcite , it is claimed that the temperature dependence of the resistivity is much milder than that of the variable - range - hopping transport @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) @xcite and that the fitting range is narrow .",
    "a scenario of quantum criticality is quite intriguing @xcite , but it is difficult to explain the seebeck coefficient of the rh - substituted samples in following reason ; as mentioned before , the @xmath8 value in the resistivity , a measure of strength of the correlation effect , decreases with increasing rh content , as is understood from a weak correlation of rh @xmath9 electrons .",
    "this indicates that the rh - substituted samples locate far from the quantum critical point . since the @xmath8 value is intimately related to the electronic specific heat and seebeck coefficient through the effective mass @xcite , the rh - substituted samples with lower effective mass should have a smaller seebeck coefficient than that of the parent ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 in the case of the quantum critical scenario",
    "this is , however , opposite to the present results in which the seebeck coefficient is increased by rh substitution at low temperatures .    as an origin of the low - temperature transport behaviors , we consider a formation of the pseudogap associated with the short - range order of sdw , which is suggested in bi - substituted ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals @xcite .",
    "at low temperatures , the seebeck coefficient in a two - dimensional metal is expressed as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the charge of carrier , @xmath51 the @xmath37-axis length , @xmath39 the carrier concentration @xcite .",
    "now the conduction carrier is hole , hence @xmath52 . using eq .",
    "( 1 ) , @xmath53 can be evaluated from @xmath54 as @xmath55 figure 4 depicts the temperature dependence of @xmath54 at low temperatures .",
    "hsieh @xmath56 @xmath57 have shown that the decrease of @xmath54 with lowering temperature originates from the decrease of the carrier concentration @xmath39 according to eq .",
    "( 2 ) @xcite , which is also supported from the results of the hall coefficient measurements @xcite , and proposed that this phenomenon is ascribed to an opening of the pseudogap caused by the short - range order of sdw below 100  k @xcite .",
    "we also note that such a reduction of @xmath54 below a pseudogap temperature is observed in other layered cobalt oxide @xcite and the kondo semiconductor cenisn @xcite .     of ca@xmath0co@xmath5rh@xmath6o@xmath2 single crystals ( @xmath41 ) at low temperatures .",
    "the inset depicts the rh content @xmath3 dependence of @xmath58 at which the resistivity takes the minimum value in the low - temperature range . ]",
    "we then discuss how the rh substitution affects the pseudogap behavior . in the present study",
    ", @xmath54 systematically decreases with rh substitution below 100  k. within the pseudogap scenario , the present result shows that @xmath39 decreases with increasing rh content , indicating that the pseudogap associated with sdw becomes large by rh substitution .",
    "now we stress that this is consistent with our resistivity results . in this system ,",
    "the resistivity minimum around 70  k is associated with an onset of sdw gap formation @xcite .",
    "therefore , according to above scenario , the onset temperature should increase with increasing rh content .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "4 displays the rh content dependence of @xmath58 at which the resistivity takes the minimum value in the low - temperature range .",
    "indeed , the onset temperature @xmath58 increases with increasing rh content , supporting the pseudogap scenario . on the other hand",
    ", it is an open question at present why the pseudogap is stabilized by rh substitution .",
    "an underlying mechanism should be examined by future microscopic measurements .",
    "next we remark the high - temperature transport in this system . in the parent compound ,",
    "the seebeck coefficient around room temperature is well explained by the modified heikes formula @xcite , which considers a hole hopping between co@xmath59 and co@xmath60 sites both of which take low - spin states @xcite .",
    "in contrast , an origin of the enhancement of the seebeck coefficient above 400 k is not clear .",
    "it is theoretically suggested that a mixture of low - spin and high - spin states may enhance the seebeck coefficient @xcite .",
    "thus , a thermally - induced spin - state crossover from low - spin into higher - spin state is suggested for the enhancement of seebeck coefficient @xcite , but the nature of spin states at high temperatures is still puzzling @xcite .    in the present study , the rh substitution suppresses such an enhancement , and the seebeck coefficient becomes almost temperature independent for @xmath4 sample .",
    "this behavior may be naively understood within a suppression of the spin - state crossover by rh substitution .",
    "in contrast to co ions , the spin state of which often dramatically varies with temperature , rh ions usually show the stable low - spin state owing to the large crystal field splitting between @xmath20 and @xmath61 manifolds @xcite .",
    "thus , at high temperatures , the number of the transition - metal ions with higher - spin states , which can enhance the seebeck coefficient , would be decreased in average by increasing rh content .",
    "this leads to a possible suppression of the high - temperature seebeck coefficient in rh - substituted crystals .",
    "let us discuss an origin of the reduction of the high - temperature resistivity in the rh - substituted samples . in the high - temperature range ,",
    "the seebeck coefficient is described by the heikes formula , indicating that the carrier concentration is temperature - independent .",
    "we also note that it shows almost the same value of 130  @xmath17v / k from 200 to 300  k for all the samples .",
    "this implies that the carrier concentration does not change with rh substitution , which is also supported by the isovalent substitution .",
    "therefore the decrease of the resistivity in rh - substituted samples originates from an increase of hole mobility by rh substitution . here",
    ", the hole hopping occurs in the @xmath20 manifolds of co / rh ions , and the effective mass of carriers becomes small with increasing rh content because of the weak correlation and the broad orbital of the rh @xmath9 electrons .",
    "this may lead to a higher mobility in the rh - substituted crystals .",
    "we also mention a bad - metal state above @xmath16  k realized in the parent compound . in a bad - metal state , a hallmark of strongly correlated electron systems @xcite , the resistivity is increased with increasing temperature beyond the mott limit . in the present study , as seen in the fermi - liquid parameter @xmath8 in the resistivity , the correlation effect is weakened in rh - substituted samples and consequently the bad - metal state disappears in @xmath4 sample . since the resistivity increases in the bad - metal state , the disappearance of bad - metal state , along with the increase of hole mobility discussed above , may lead to a reduction of the resistivity in @xmath4 sample .    finally let us comment on the thermoelectric energy - conversion efficiency of the present crystals .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "3(b ) shows the temperature variations of the power factor @xmath42 of the present crystals . for @xmath4 sample ,",
    "the power factor reaches a large value of @xmath62  w / mk@xmath63 at 600  k thanks to the low resistivity .",
    "it is interesting to enlarge the power factor by decreasing effective mass in contrast to the usual approach to the high thermoelectric performance @xcite .",
    "moreover , previous report using the polycrystalline samples shows that the rh substitutions strongly suppress the thermal conductivity in this system @xcite .",
    "thus the thermal conductivity of the single - crystalline samples should be investigated as a future issue .",
    "an importance of the thermoelectric study using single crystals is also highlighted by the discovery of the high thermoelectric efficiency in snse single crystals @xcite .",
    "we study the electrical and thermoelectric transport properties of the layered ca@xmath0co@xmath5rh@xmath6o@xmath2 single crystals in a broad temperature range from 10  k up to 650  k. in the metal - like region around 120  k , the fermi - liquid transport coefficient @xmath8 decreases with increasing rh content @xmath3 , indicating smaller effective mass in the rh - substituted samples because of the weak correlation effect of rh @xmath9 electrons compared with co @xmath10 electrons . at lower temperatures , in contrast to the weak correlation effect found in the rh - substituted samples , we observe that the seebeck coefficient increases with increasing rh substitution , which is also different from the results of the previous polycrystalline study .",
    "we suggest that this behavior is attributed to an enlargement of a pseudogap in the rh - substituted crystals , which is accompanied with the short - range order of the spin density wave below 100  k , as is supported from the increase of the spin - density - wave onset temperature by rh substitution .    at higher temperatures ,",
    "the resistivity is decreased with increasing rh content owing to a small effective mass of rh - substituted samples .",
    "such a low resistivity in rh - substituted crystal indeed enhances the power factor at high temperatures .",
    "the seebeck coefficient of ca@xmath0co@xmath30rh@xmath31o@xmath2 becomes almost temperature independent up to 650  k , possibly originating from a suppression of a spin - state crossover by the substitution of rh ions which favor the low - spin state .",
