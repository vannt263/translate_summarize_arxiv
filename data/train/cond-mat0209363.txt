    "the liquid - solid transition in two dimensional systems of particles under the influence of external modulating potentials has recently attracted a fair amount of attention from experiments @xcite , theory  @xcite and computer simulations  @xcite .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that well controlled , clean experiments can be performed using colloidal particles  @xcite confined between glass plates ( producing essentially a two - dimensional system ) and subjected to a spatially periodic electromagnetic field generated by interfering two , or more , crossed laser beams .",
    "one of the more surprising results of these studies , where a commensurate , one dimensional , modulating potential is imposed , is the fact that there exist regions in the phase diagram over which one observes reentrant  @xcite freezing / melting behavior . as a function of the laser field intensity",
    "the system first freezes from a modulated liquid to a two dimensional triangular solid .",
    "a further increase of the intensity confines the particles strongly within the troughs of the external potential , suppressing fluctuations perpendicular to the troughs , which leads to an uncoupling of neighboring troughs and to re - melting .",
    "our present understanding of this curious phenomenon has come from early mean field density functional  @xcite and more recent dislocation unbinding  @xcite calculations .",
    "the mean field theories neglect fluctuations and therefore can not explain reentrant behavior .",
    "the order of the transition is predicted to be first order for small laser field intensities , though for certain combinations of external potentials ( which includes the specific geometry studied in the experiments and in this paper ) the transition may become second order after going through a tricritical point . in general , though mean field theories are applicable in any dimension , the results are expected to be accurate only for higher dimensions and long ranged potentials .",
    "the validity of the predictions of such theories for the system under consideration is , therefore , in doubt .",
    "a more recent theory  @xcite extends the dislocation unbinding mechanism for two - dimensional melting  @xcite to systems under external potentials .",
    "for a two - dimensional triangular solid subjected to an external one - dimensional modulating potential , the only dislocations involved are those which have their burger s vectors parallel to the troughs of the potential .",
    "the system , therefore , maps onto an anisotropic , scalar coulomb gas ( or xy model )  @xcite in contrast to a _ vector _ coulomb gas  @xcite for the pure @xmath1 melting problem .",
    "once bound dislocation pairs are integrated out , the melting temperature is obtained as a function of the renormalized or `` effective '' elastic constants which depend on external parameters like the strength of the potential , temperature and/or density .",
    "though explicit calculations are possible only near the two extreme limits of zero and infinite field intensities , one can argue effectively that a reentrant melting transition is expected on general grounds quite independent of the detailed nature of the interaction potential for any two - dimensional system subject to such external potentials .",
    "the actual extent of this region could , of course , vary from system to system .",
    "in addition , these authors predict that the autocorrelation function of the fourier components of the density ( the debye - waller correlation function ) decays algebraically in the solid phase at the transition with an universal exponent which depends only on the geometry and the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "computer simulation results in this field have so far been inconclusive .",
    "early simulations  @xcite involving colloidal particles interacting via the derjaguin , landau , verwey and overbeek ( dlvo ) potential  @xcite found a large reentrant region in apparent agreement with later experiments . on closer scrutiny , though , quantitative agreement between simulation and experiments on the same system ( but with slightly different parameters ) appears to be poor  @xcite .",
    "subsequent simulations  @xcite have questioned the findings of the earlier computation and the calculated phase diagram does not show a significant reentrant liquid phase .    motivated , in part , by this controversy , in ref .",
    "@xcite we have recently investigated the freezing / melting behavior of a two dimensional hard disk system in an external potential .",
    "the pure hard disk system is rather well studied  @xcite by now and the nature of the melting transition in the absence of external potentials reasonably well explored .",
    "also , there exist colloidal systems with hard interactions  @xcite so that , at least in principle , actual experiments using this system are possible .",
    "finally , a hard disk simulation is relatively cheap to implement and one can make detailed studies of large systems without straining computational resources . by these calculations we obtained a clear signature of a reentrant liquid phase showing that this phenomenon is indeed a general one as indicated in ref .  .",
    "in the present paper we studied a system of particles interacting by a dlvo potential in a external periodic potential , motivated on one hand whether this reentrance scenario is dependent on the range of interaction , and on the other hand to compare it with experimental results @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram has been computed by an application of finite size scaling methods similar to the methods used in our study of the hard disk systems in external potentials  @xcite .",
    "the rest of our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we specify the model and the simulation method including details of the finite size analysis used . in section iii we present our results for both zero and non - zero external potential , in particular results for the order parameter and its cumulants with a discussion on finite size effects . we also present other quantities like order parameter susceptibility , correlation functions and heat capacity , which further illustrates the nature of the phase transitions in this system . in section",
    "iv we discuss our work in relation to the existing literature on this subject , summarize and conclude .",
    "we study a system of n soft disks in a two dimensional box of fixed volume interacting with the dlvo pair potential @xmath2  @xcite between particles @xmath3 and @xmath4 with distance @xmath5 ,    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the radius of the particles , @xmath8 is the inverse debye screening length , @xmath9 is the effective surface charge , and @xmath10 is the dielectric constant of water .",
    "we used @xmath11 and , unless otherwise indicated , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "additionally we chose a temperature of @xmath14 , and the particle density such that the particle spacing of an ideal lattice is @xmath15 .",
    "we then obtain different values for the reduced inverse screening length @xmath0 by varying @xmath16 as needed . in our simulation",
    "we set @xmath17 to be the unit length .",
    "the potential in eq .",
    "( [ interaction ] ) mainly depends on the value of @xmath0 , so all features found for this system should be valid also for slightly different values of the other parameters mentioned above .",
    "in addition a particle with coordinates @xmath18 is exposed to an external periodic potential of the form : @xmath19 the constant @xmath20 in eq.([field ] ) is chosen such that , for a density @xmath21 , the modulation is commensurate to a triangular lattice of disks with nearest neighbor distance @xmath22 : @xmath23 .",
    "the main parameters which define our system are @xmath24 and the reduced potential strength @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "all of the data ( unless otherwise indicated ) presented for @xmath27 are obtained by a simulation in a rectangular box of size @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) and periodic boundary conditions in x- and y - direction , i.e. exactly as in @xcite",
    ". we will refer to it as fixed box geometry in the rest of the paper .",
    "for @xmath30 the external potential modulates the structure of the fluid and the particles form troughs oriented in the @xmath31-direction . in order to avoid unphysical results , for @xmath32 we mainly used a box with periodic boundary conditions in x - direction and _ movable walls _ in y - direction , see fig .",
    "[ geometry ] , and we will call this variable box geometry. the simulation box volume is fixed as well as the side length @xmath33 , but in @xmath34-direction the box is divided into slabs of width @xmath20 , centered around the minima of the external periodic potential .",
    "the wall at the end of each slab can move at most @xmath35 upwards or downwards around its equilibrium position : @xmath36 , such that each slab has variable length between @xmath37 and @xmath38 in @xmath31-direction .",
    "the averaged box geometry still is @xmath29 as for the fixed one .",
    "the constraint for neighboring walls is to have a distance less than @xmath39 : @xmath40 .",
    "the walls are hard , so no particle can cross them .",
    "this is indicated as thick solid line in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] . to accommodate the particles in the box as well as possible , additional boundary particles were placed in center ( @xmath41 ) behind each wall at a distance of @xmath42 .",
    "the boundary particles interact with the particles in the box by the usual dlvo potential , but do not interact with each other .",
    "the motion of the walls is done with a monte - carlo procedure and keeps the volume constant , so we are still in the nvt ( but variable shape ) ensemble .",
    "the movable walls are chosen to give the system additional degrees of freedom to relax internal stress .",
    "we were lead to this geometry by some unphysical results when using the fixed box geometry and higher particle numbers ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "for a detailed discussion see end of section [ extsec ] .",
    "we perform nvt monte carlo ( mc ) simulations  @xcite for the system with interactions given by eqs .",
    "( [ interaction ] ) and ( [ field ] ) for various values of @xmath44 and @xmath24 .",
    "averages @xmath45 of observables have been obtained with the canonical measure . in order to obtain thermodynamic quantities for a range of system sizes",
    ", we analyzed various quantities within subsystems and used @xmath46 to denote averages in it .",
    "the subsystems are of size @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are chosen as @xmath50 and @xmath51 consistent with the geometry of the triangular lattice .",

    "[ g1 ] contains in average @xmath53 particles .",
    "most of the simulations described below have been done for a total system size of @xmath54 and @xmath55 particles , additional ones with @xmath56 .",
    "phase transitions have been studied in most cases by starting in the ordered solid and increasing @xmath24 for fixed @xmath57 .",
    "runs where @xmath24 is decreased were also performed for comparison .",
    "a typical simulation run with @xmath58 monte carlo steps ( mcs ) per particle ( including 3 @xmath59 mcs for relaxation ) took about 50 cpu hours on a pii/500 mhz pc .",
    "in addition to ordinary ( local ) mc moves we also used ` trough moves ' , by which particle placements in neighboring troughs are tried .",
    "besides producing faster equilibration , including such moves ensures that at high @xmath60 the formation of dislocations is not artificially hindered since particles can in effect bypass each other more easily  this is very unlikely with purely local mc moves .",
    "the potential energy of the system per particle @xmath61 is computed by : @xmath62\\ ] ] and the heat capacity per particle from the fluctuations of @xmath63 : @xmath64    the nature of the fluid - solid phase transition in two dimensions has been a topic of controversy throughout the last forty years  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that true long range positional order is absent in the infinitely large system due to low energy long wavelength excitations so that translational correlations decay algebraically . according to the dislocation unbinding mechanism  @xcite the two dimensional solid ( with quasi long ranged positional and long ranged orientational order )",
    "first melts into a `` hexatic '' phase with no positional order but with quasi long ranged orientational order signified by an algebraic decay of bond - orientational correlation .",
    "a second kt transition , driven by disclination unbinding , leads to melting of the hexatic into the liquid , where both the orientational and positional order is short ranged .",
    "therefore a useful order parameter in zero external field is the orientational order parameter . for a particle @xmath4 located at @xmath65",
    "we define the local orientational order : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the number of nearest neighbors , and @xmath68 the angle between the axis @xmath69 and an arbitrary reference axis . for the total system we use : @xmath70 and as orientational correlation function : @xmath71    in an external periodic field given by eq.([field ] ) , however , the bond orientational order parameter is nonzero even in the fluid phase  @xcite .",
    "this is because for @xmath72 we have now a `` modulated '' liquid , in which local hexagons consisting of the six nearest neighbors of a particle are automatically oriented by the external field .",
    "thus @xmath73 is nonzero both in the ( modulated ) liquid and the crystalline phase and it can not be used to study phase transitions in this system .",
    "the order parameters corresponding to a solid phase are the fourier components of the ( non - uniform ) density @xmath74 calculated at the reciprocal lattice points @xmath75 .",
    "this ( infinite ) set of numbers are all zero ( for @xmath76 ) in an uniform liquid phase and nonzero in a solid .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the star consisting of the six smallest reciprocal lattice vectors of the two - dimensional triangular lattice . in the modulated liquid phase that is relevant to our system , the fourier components corresponding to two out of these six vectors , viz .",
    "those in the direction perpendicular to the troughs of the external potential , are nonzero  @xcite .",
    "the other four components of this set consisting of the one in the direction @xmath77 ( as defined for the ideal crystal in fig .",
    "[ g1 ] ) , and those equivalent to it by symmetry , are zero in the ( modulated ) liquid and nonzero in the solid ( if there is true long range order ) .",
    "we therefore use the following order parameter : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the position vector of the @xmath80 particle . the corresponding susceptibility",
    "@xmath81 is : @xmath82\\ ] ] to measure the positional correlation , we chose the debye - waller correlation function which we define as follows : @xmath83 where @xmath84 points to the elementary cell of the ideal lattice , and @xmath85 is the deviation of the actual particle position from the ideal lattice : @xmath86 . in this case",
    "we have chosen the direction of @xmath84 to lie along the @xmath31 axis ( i.e. along the troughs of the potential ) . in the solid",
    "we expect this quantity do decay algebraically , i.e. @xmath87 @xcite , where @xmath88 depends on the elastic constants .",
    "@xmath89 is sensitive to the phase transition where positional order is lost .",
    "therefore , when decreasing @xmath60 we expect the phase boundary to converge to the corresponding transition at zero external potential .",
    "but in contrast to @xmath90 where the crystal is oriented by the external potential , at @xmath91 it is only weakly fixed by the boundary conditions and can start to rotate , so we can not apply @xmath89 there . for this purpose",
    "we use a slightly modified positional order parameter @xmath92 at @xmath91 : the phase information of @xmath93 ( of course , before taking the absolute value ) is used to determine the orientation of the crystal , and then a tilted coordinate system is used to compute @xmath92 .",
    "we applied the same method when calculating @xmath94 at @xmath91 .",
    "we have determined phase transition points by the order parameter cumulant intersection method .",
    "the fourth order cumulant @xmath95 of the order parameter distribution is given by @xcite : @xmath96 in order to distuingish between the cumulants of @xmath93 and @xmath89 , we denote them with @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively . in the liquid ( short ranged order ) @xmath99 and in the solid ( long range order ) @xmath100 for @xmath101 . in case of a continuous transition close to the transition",
    "point the cumulant is only a function of the ratio of the system size @xmath102 and the correlation length @xmath103 : @xmath104 . since @xmath103 diverges at the critical point the cumulants for different",
    "system sizes intersect in one point : @xmath105 .",
    "@xmath106 is a non - trivial value , i.e. @xmath107 and @xmath108 . even for first order transitions these cumulants intersect  @xcite though",
    "the value @xmath109 of @xmath95 at the intersection is not universal any more .",
    "the intersection point can , therefore , be taken as the phase boundary regardless of the order of the transition .",
    "this is useful since the order of the melting transition in @xmath1 either in the absence  @xcite or with  @xcite external potentials is not unequivocally settled .",
    "and there is also another aspect in our special case : since the positional order correlation is predicted to decay algebraically in the solid phase ( quasi long ranged order ) , the whole solid can be seen as consisting of a line or area of critical points with temperature- dependent critical indices @xmath110 @xcite . in that case",
    "we expect the cumulants to merge at a nontrivial value at the onset of the solid phase instead of intersecting , yielding a line of intersections .",
    "we indeed observed this behavior for hard disks in high external potentials @xcite .",
    "for the same reasons the same behavior is expected for the @xmath93-cumulants at the liquid - hexatic transition and in the hexatic phase@xcite .",
    "also the very similar 2d - xy - spin model shows this behavior when using the magnetization as order parameter @xcite .    note",
    "that though the order parameter @xmath111 decays to zero with increasing system size even in the 2-d solid ( assuming quasi long ranged order there ) , the cumulants will stay at the non - trivial value regardless of @xmath112 .",
    "so for @xmath101 there should be a jump from @xmath113 to this nontrivial value when crossing the phase boundary from liquid to solid , which underlines the usefulness of cumulants . in order to map the phase diagram we systematically vary the system parameters @xmath57 and @xmath24 to detect order parameter cumulant intersection- or merging points which are then identified with the phase boundary",
    "in this section we analyse the system properties for zero external field . in particular we present results for the order parameter , the cumulants , the correlation functions and the heat capacity for different values of @xmath24 . in these studies we used the fixed box geometry .    in fig .",
    "[ psi60 ] the cumulant of the @xmath114 order parameter versus @xmath24 is shown for different subsystem sizes .",
    "we identify the phase transition value of @xmath115 at about 14.42 by locating the cumulant intersection point .",
    "since the positional order is not well defined in two - dimensional systems , the positional order parameter @xmath116 shows a strong system - size dependency , see fig .",
    "[ psitg0 ] .",
    "the cumulants of @xmath116 intersect at a value of @xmath117 , which is slightly smaller than @xmath115 .",
    "this is in agreement with a kthny two stage melting scenario , in which the solid and the fluid phase are separated by a `` hexatic '' region in the phase diagram , in which the positional order is short ranged and the bond - orientational order is long ranged .",
    "both effects are detected by the two order parameters , @xmath114 being sensitive for the bond - orientational order and @xmath116 on the positional order .",

    "[ cv ] ( left ) we present the heat capacity data versus @xmath24 for different system sizes .",
    "it is obvious that the heat capacity does not show a singularity as would be expected in case of a first order or a conventional second - order transition .",
    "the peak maxima are not very sharp , but are roughly located close to the value of @xmath115 , where the @xmath114-order parameter cumulants intersect .",
    "the peak maxima thus do not agree with the cumulant intersection point of the @xmath116-order parameter , which is again in agreement with the kthny scenario .",
    "we note that the identification of the phase transition point by the heat capacity maxima may result in misleading results on the location of the transition points in the phase diagram .",
    "in particular , for a smaller system of n = 400 particles we find that configurations wherein the crystal is rotated by a tilt angle of @xmath124 ( @xmath125 extracted from the phase information of @xmath93 ) may be present . since this is incompatible with the box geometry it leads to a higher energy and a lower measured @xmath126 .",

    "we note that with increasing system size in fixed box geometry all transition points are slightly shifted to the solid region , whereas for the variable box this shift is towards the liquid region .",
    "one can see that the shift for the fixed box is much smaller at low @xmath60 , and for the variable box it is much smaller at medium and high @xmath60 .",
    "we also found that the cumulant intersection point smears out strongly if using the fixed box , @xmath163 and higher @xmath60 , probably for the same reasons as those mentioned in the discussion of the debye - waller correlation function . in the variable box",
    "there was no such problem .",
    "these features were the reason for us to use mainly the fixed box for @xmath27 and the variable box for @xmath32 . by the way",
    ", the same debye - waller problem also occurs when simulating hard disks in external periodic potentials , @xmath163 and @xmath60 medium or high , and can be solved again by using the variable box geometry .",
    "however , for all system sizes the structure of the phase diagram with a pronounced minimum at intermediate values of @xmath57 is not affected by the shifts .    the difference in the value of @xmath164 at the transition between the infinite and zero external potential cases , we find @xmath165 .",
    "this is not far away from @xmath166 which is a value predicted by @xcite .",
    "we have also done simulations with slightly altered parameters , i.e using particles with diameter @xmath167 , effective surface charge @xmath168 and @xmath169 , to match the experiments in @xcite .",
    "as expected , we only observe a slightly shift of the phase diagram of @xmath170 towards higher values of @xmath171 .",
    "the experimental phase diagram @xcite qualitatively has the same shape as our results , but shows larger freezing- and reentrance regions and is shifted to higher values of @xmath171 at about @xmath172 in average .",
    "the reasons for these differences are probably due to the particle interaction .",
    "we only use pairwise interaction , which is a good approximation for low particle densities @xcite .",
    "but for higher particle densities many body interactions play a role because of macroion screening , which results in an effective pair potential that has considerable deviations @xcite from a pure yukawa - like potential like ours .",
    "in particular , there could be an attractive part .",
    "we next try to determine the order of the phase transitions encountered in this system for two values of @xmath134 . in order to investigate this issue we studied the scaling behavior of the order parameter , susceptibility and the order parameter cumulant near the phase boundary for a small ( @xmath173 ) and a large ( @xmath174 ) @xmath175 .    from finite size",
    "scaling theory ( for an overview see ref .",
    "@xcite ) we expect these quantities to scale as  @xcite : @xmath176 @xmath177 @xmath178 here @xmath179 , @xmath180 ( for critical scaling ) , and @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 are scaling functions . defining @xmath184",
    ", we expect the correlation length @xmath103 to diverge as @xmath185 for an ordinary critical point , while for a kt - transition we have an essential singularity and @xmath186 when approaching the transition from the liquid side .    in fig .",
    "[ sca ] we have plotted the left hand sides of eqs.([scop ] ) , ( [ scchi ] ) and ( [ sccu ] ) versus @xmath187 for @xmath130 , where data points of the variable box geometry for @xmath188 have been considered and @xmath189 , obtained by cumulant intersection . in order not to introduce an unwarranted bias , we have separately considered ordinary critical scaling ( left column ) and a kt scaling form ( right column ) and adjusted the values of the parameters @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 , or @xmath193 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath194 , till we obtained collapse of our data onto a single curve determined by a least square estimator . and @xmath193 are relatively big because for example increasing @xmath194 and decreasing @xmath193 by an appropriate amount resulted in a nearly equally good collapse . ]",
    "good collapse of our data is observed for both scaling forms , the numerical values for @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 for kt scaling ( @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 ) are relatively close to the predicted values  @xcite ( @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 ) .",
    "the situation is similar for small @xmath203 , the quality of the collapse comparable to the one of @xmath204 .",
    "the critical parameters were obtained in this case for values @xmath205 , with @xmath206 .",
    "we have a good internal consistency between @xmath207 extracted from the debye - waller correlation function , and the values obtained from data collapsing : @xmath208 for @xmath204 , and @xmath209 for @xmath136 .",
    "our results for the numerical values of the parameters are summarized in table  i.    a more precise classification of the phase transitions with the present data and system sizes is not easy .",
    "this topic is left for future work , in particular we plan to compute the elastic properties of the system by a method recently developed for the hard disk system  @xcite and to test the kt predictions  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the phase diagram of a two dimensional system of soft disks , interacting via a dlvo potential , in an external sinusoidal potential .",
    "we find freezing followed by reentrant melting transitions over a significant region of the phase diagram in tune with results on hard disks @xcite , previous experiments on colloids  @xcite and with the expectations of a dislocation unbinding theory  @xcite .",
    "one of the main features of our calculation is the method used to locate phase boundaries . in contrast to earlier simulations  @xcite which used either the jump of the order parameter or specific heat maxima to locate the phase transition , we used the more reliable cumulant intersection method .",
    "it must be noted that the specific heat in this system does not show a strong peak at the phase transition density so that its use may lead to confusing results .",
    "this , in our opinion , may be the reason for part of the controversy in this field .",
    "it is possible that earlier simulations which used smaller systems and no systematic finite size analysis may have overlooked this feature of @xmath210 which becomes apparent only in computations involving large system sizes .",
    "we have shown that finite size scaling of the order parameter cumulants as obtained from subsystem or subblock analysis , on the other hand , yields an accurate phase diagram .    what is the order of the phase transition ?",
    "we know that  @xcite for the pure hard disk system in two dimensions this question is quite difficult to answer and our present understanding  @xcite is that this system shows a kthny transition .",
    "in our system of soft disks , for zero external potential we can rule out a strong first order transition , although smaller systems show a feature ( double peak in the internal energy ) which mimics such a behavior .",
    "we find several features which are consistent with the kt theory , but also one which is not . upon turning on the external periodic potential ,",
    "the difference between hexatic and liquid disappears , and an ( anisotropic ) kt transition  @xcite from the modulated liquid into the solid is expected .",
    "our results show several features which suggest that this is what we have , but there are still some ( not large ) deviations from theory . though we have discussed these observations in the rest of the paper , we list the important ones below for clarity :    * the behavior of the cumulants near the transition is similar to an earlier work  @xcite on the xy system which shows a kt transition . *",
    "the specific heat is relatively featureless and does not scale with system size in a fashion expected of a true first order or conventional continuous transition . *",
    "the decay of the correlation functions is similar to what is predicted  @xcite for an anisotropic scalar coulomb gas .",
    "* for two test values of @xmath60 , the scaling of the order parameter , the susceptibility and the cumulant may be reasonable described by the kt theory .    of course , in order to resolve this issue unambiguously yet larger simulations are required . also , we need to compute elastic properties  @xcite of this system in order to compare directly with the results of ref .",
