    "in recent years , there has been considerable interests focusing on quantum feedback control due to its applications in metrology , quantum optics , quantum computation , quantum communication and other quantum technologies [ 1]-[16 ] .",
    "moreover , it has been recognized that quantum feedback control plays a vital role in manipulating a quantum mechanical system to achieve some pre - required closed loop properties such as stability @xcite , @xcite , robustness @xcite , @xcite , entanglement @xcite or other performance requirement @xcite , @xcite . in particular , linear quantum optics",
    "are widely studied in control areas and a quantum optical system can often be described by a set of linear quantum stochastic differential equations ( qsdes ) @xcite .    in the conventional picture of quantum feedback control , digital or analog electronic devices",
    "are often implemented as controllers @xcite .",
    "however , this tends to destroy quantum coherence and involves the destruction of quantum information in the process of making measurements .",
    "hence , recent research has been focused on using a fully quantum system as a controller , which is referred to as a coherent controller , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "compared to measurement feedback control , the advantages of coherent control are to preserve quantum coherence , to achieve improved performance and to obtain a high speed processing bandwidth . however",
    ", when we consider coherent feedback control using the qsde description , the issue of physical realizability of controllers arises @xcite , @xcite .",
    "that is , in qsdes framework , the state space matrices defining the coherent controller are required to satisfy certain conditions in order that the controller represents a physically meaningful quantum system and we call these kind of conditions physical realizability conditions .",
    "however , in this paper , we use an @xmath0 framework to define quantum systems , where @xmath1 is a hamiltonian operator , @xmath2 is a vector of coupling operators and @xmath3 is a scattering matrix @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath2 describes the interface between the system and the field , and the operator @xmath1 defines the self - energy of the system . since the parameters @xmath0 already describe a physically realizable system , we do not need to be concerned about physical realizability conditions .",
    "quantum feedback controllers have been designed with a number of different techniques .",
    "for example , an @xmath4 synthesis approach @xcite and a lqg method @xcite have been used to design a quantum controller for a class of linear quantum stochastic systems ; @xcite used a transfer function method to analyze the robustness of feedback quantum systems .",
    "nevertheless , few papers have considered quantum controller design based on an @xmath0 description .",
    "based on the parameters @xmath0 , we are going to design a guaranteed cost coherent controller not only to robustly stabilize the uncertain quantum system , but also to guarantee a specific level of performance for any admissible value of the uncertainties . in the previous papers on quantum controller design @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "the coupling between the plant and the controller is via a field coupling which we call indirect coupling . in the controller design parts of this paper , we use two different methods .",
    "one is to add controller hamiltonian and the other is to construct a directly coupled quantum controller for the given system . here , direct coupling refers to that two independent quantum systems may interact by exchanging energy @xcite , @xcite and this energy exchange is often described by an interaction hamiltonian . in this paper ,",
    "the guaranteed cost coherent controller design is given in terms of lmi and nonlinear equality conditions .",
    "we use a nonlinear change of variables to convert the problem into a rank constrained lmi problem which can be solved using an alternating projections algorithm @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ problem statement ] , we define the nominal quantum system under consideration as a linear system using parameters @xmath0 .",
    "then an uncertain perturbation of the hamiltonian is introduced in terms of a commutator decomposition and sector bound conditions in section [ perturbation of the hamiltonian ] . in section",
    "[ performance analysis ] , the cost function for uncertain linear quantum systems subject to quadratic perturbation of the hamiltonian is defined and a small gain type performance analysis result is presented . in section [ static coherent controller ] , we introduce a controller hamiltonian and present a theorem to show the construction of this guaranteed cost quantum controller . in section [ dynamic coherent controller ] , a dynamic controller system is directly coupled to the uncertain quantum system . the corresponding controller design and numerical procedures are presented .",
    "an illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the coherent controller methods in section [ illustrative example ] .",
    "we also make a performance comparison between the static coherent controller and the dynamic coherent controller .",
    "some conclusions are presented in section [ conclusion ] .",
