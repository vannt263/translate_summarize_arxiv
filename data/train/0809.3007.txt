    "locally_. global calibration is a top - down technique where hadronic objects from specific physics processes are reconstructed relative to a fixed ( global ) electromagnetic scale .",
    "cells may be combined along the @xmath1-@xmath2 direction to form cell towers , out of which _ tower jets _ may be reconstructed after applying cell and calorimeter layer weights based on the deposited jet energy density .",
    "the local calibration method is a bottom - up approach which starts with the response of cells and cell clusters , to which sets of weights based on the ratio of the deposited energy to the signal reconstructed on the electromagnetic energy scale , as determined with simulations , are applied . from such calibrated topological clusters we reconstruct _",
    "topological jets_.    in what follows we present a simulation study designed to assess the atlas calorimeter performance through the jet energy scale ( jes ) determination from the top - antitop pair simulation .",
    "the work on the universal jes definition is still in progress . for the study presented here we use two simple formulas : @xmath3 the first of the two equations relates the energy @xmath4 of the true ( particle ) jet to that of the measured ( reconstructed ) jet @xmath5 .",
    "the scale factor @xmath6 depends on energy , pseudorapidity ( @xmath1 ) , jet resolution ( @xmath7 ) and instantaneous luminosity ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the second equation provides a transition from the true jet to the quark that gave rise to the jet .",
    "the true jet - parton scale factor @xmath9 depends on the parton energy , jet cone size @xmath10 and the pileup resulting from additional proton collisions in a bunch crossing , which is proportional to the instantaneous luminosity @xmath8 .",
    "the top - antitop events considered here ( fig . [ fig : feyn ] , left ) have been generated using mc@nlo @xcite and simulated with geant4 @xcite .",
    "four types of reconstructed events with various jet settings were compared : the seeded cone jet algorithm @xcite with parameter @xmath11 set at 0.4 and 0.7 , and the @xmath12 algorithm @xcite with @xmath13 of the @xmath12 algorithm is also commonly referred to as @xmath14 . ] and 0.6 . among the various cuts applied , events with at least 4 jets with @xmath15 gev/@xmath16 were chosen , and pairs of non-@xmath17-tagged jets are selected as the @xmath18 jet candidates .",
    "partons in this case are quarks from the @xmath18 decay . @xmath6 and @xmath9 may be extracted from fig .",

    "we find @xmath22 and @xmath23 .     and 0.7 and @xmath12 jets with @xmath13 and 0.6 were applied .",

    "the figures are used to extract @xmath6 and @xmath9.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0%,height=188 ]    from fig .",
    "[ fig : kttbar ] it is clear that the performance of the reconstructed jets relative to the true jets and true jets relative to the partons for the energy range shown is best for the seeded cone jet algorithm with @xmath24 and the @xmath12 algorithm with @xmath25 .",
    "we select the cone algorithm with @xmath24 as the default and use it on jets reconstructed from towers and from topological clusters ( fig .",
    "[ pic : jes_sys ] , left ) .",
    "we observe that , without pileup effects included , the resolution does not change with the reconstruction method and note that it varies between 8 and 19% for the energy range shown . in the same figure",
    "we also consider the effects of pileup , a consequence of the increased luminosity giving rise to the proportional number of multiple interactions . for a luminosity of @xmath0",
    "the expected average number of these pileup events is 2.3 .",
    "if pileup is included , topological clustering , which results in better noise suppression , yields better resolution , especially in the lower energy range .",
    "for example , for jet energies around 50 gev , average energy resolution is decreased by only 2.5% relative to the pileup - free events , whereas the tower method yields 10% worse resolution .",
    "cone algorithm with @xmath24 reconstructed from the topological clusters is thus the best choice for the jets in the top - antitop process .",

    "right : results of the fit to the @xmath18 mass from light jets for different gluon radiation settings.,height=181 ]    an applied @xmath26 cut on the measured jets biases the available momentum phase space toward higher @xmath26 values ( hence , higher energy values ) resulting in higher values of the jet energy scale ( fig .",
    "[ pic : jes_sys ] , center ) .",
    "the error bars correspond to uncertainties in @xmath26 if the resolution is varied by 20% ( roughly the worst case scenario according to the results above ) .",
    "the 40 gev/@xmath16 @xmath26 cut used throughout this analysis thus results in a 2% uncertainty .",
    "for a 40 gev/@xmath16 @xmath26 cut the bias on the @xmath18 mass was found to be about @xmath27 gev/@xmath28 .    in order to study the influence of initial and final - state radiation , three datasets with different showering settings",
    "were used : one set with mc@nlo + herwig @xcite@xcite and two sets with acermc + pythia @xcite@xcite ( fig .",
    "[ pic : jes_sys ] , right ) .",
    "the mean mass from the three measurements is slightly higher than the pdg value due to the @xmath26 cut bias .",
    "the spread between the maximum and the minimum values is about 1.7 gev/@xmath28 .",
    "in this work we have determined the values for @xmath6 , the measured jet - to - true jet scale , and @xmath9 , the true jet - parton energy scale , for the top - antitop channel .",
    "events were reconstructed using local calibration .",
    "the value of @xmath6 was found to be 1.032 for the top - antitop signal .",
    "we also considered jet resolution , shown to vary between 8 and 19% , and examined the effects of the @xmath26 cut , gluon radiation settings and pileup on the jet energy scale for the t - tbar signal .",
