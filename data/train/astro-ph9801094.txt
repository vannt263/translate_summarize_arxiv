    "the formation of galactic disks is one of the most important unsolved problems in astrophysics today . in the currently favored hierarchical clustering framework , disks form in the potential wells of dark matter halos as the baryonic material cools and collapses dissipatively .",
    "it has been shown ( fall & efstathiou @xcite , hereafter fe80 ) that disks formed in this way can be expected to possess the observed amount of angular momentum ( and therefore the observed spatial extent for a given mass and profile shape ) , but only on condition that the infalling gas retain most of its original angular momentum .    numerical simulations of this collapse scenario in a cosmological context ( e.g. , navarro & benz @xcite , navarro & white @xcite , navarro , frenk , & white @xcite ) , however , have so far consistently indicated that when only cooling processes are included the infalling gas loses too much angular momentum ( by over an order of magnitude ) and the resulting disks are accordingly much smaller than required by the observations .",
    "this discrepancy is known as the _ angular momentum problem _ of galaxy formation .",
    "it arises from the fact that gas cooling is very efficient at early times , leading to the rapid condensation of gas clouds which are then promptly slowed down by dynamical friction against the surrounding dark matter halo before they eventually merge to form the central disk .",
    "a mechanism is therefore needed that prevents , or at least delays , the collapse of protogalactic gas clouds and allows the gas to preserve a larger fraction of its angular momentum as it settles into the disk .",
    "( such a mechanism is also helpful in solving the _ overcooling problem _ , namely the observation ( white & rees @xcite ) that cooling is expected to be so efficient at early times that most of the gas should have been converted to stars well before the assembly of present - day galactic disks . )",
    "weil , eke , & efstathiou ( @xcite , hereafter wee98 ) have shown that if the cooling is suppressed ( by whatever means ) , numerical simulations can indeed yield more realistically sized disks .",
    "the physical mechanism by which cooling is suppressed or counteracted , however , is still uncertain .",
    "an early candidate was the extragalactic ionizing ultraviolet and soft x - ray ( uvx ) background which is thought to permeate the universe at least at redshifts @xmath2@xmath3 ( with quasars as an important source ) and maybe considerably earlier .",
    "such a field provides a natural explanation of the observed low optical depth in neutral hydrogen ( gunn & peterson @xcite , efstathiou @xcite ) and of the properties of the lyman  @xmath4 forest ( hernquist et  al .",
    "the effect of such a field on galaxy formation was explored by vedel , hellsten , & sommer - larsen ( @xcite , hereafter vhsl94 ) .",
    "these authors concluded that the uvx background does indeed affect the formation of both small and large galaxies .",
    "however , the uvx background is not in itself sufficient to solve the angular momentum problem : it is better at inhibiting the accretion of low - density gas at low redshift than the formation of high - density clouds at high redshift ( when inverse compton cooling is particularly efficient and capable of counteracting the uvx heating , even if one assumes that the uvx field is already strong at that time ) .",
    "this has been pointed out among others by navarro & steinmetz ( @xcite , hereafter ns97 ) , who even find that the uvx field exacerbates the angular momentum deficit .",
    "( this last detail is at variance with the result of vhsl94 .",
    "the broader fact that the uvx field alone does not solve the angular momentum problem , however , is much less controversial . )",
    "a different heating mechanism is therefore required . in this paper",
    "we explore and compare two candidate mechanisms : uniform reheating of the entire universe at @xmath5 ( as could have been caused by energy feedback from a pregalactic phase of star formation ) , and more conventional , localized feedback in the form of gas blow - out by supernova explosions in the first generation of collapsed subgalactic objects at a somewhat later epoch .",
    "we also compare the results to those of purely passive cooling simulations , with no heat sources other than the uvx background .",
    "we begin ( in section  [ s : scenarios ] ) with some plausibility arguments and estimates of relevant physical parameters for our two reheating scenarios . in particular , we derive (   [ s : trhmax ] ) an upper bound on the reheating temperature in the first scenario .",
    "section  [ s : methods ] briefly presents the numerical methods used , namely the numerical code and the model parameters and initial conditions .",
    "the simulations themselves are presented in section  [ s : simulations ] , and the results analyzed in section  [ s : results ] .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section  [ s : conclusions ] .",
    "consider the hypothesis that the universe was reheated and reionized at a relatively high redshift @xmath6 , when it was still fairly homogeneous on galactic scales .",
    "one way in which this could have come about is if at those redshifts a fraction of the gas was had collapsed into a dense , cold phase ( cf .",
    "tegmark et  al .",
    "@xcite ) out of which a small amount of stars formed . the more massive of these would quickly explode as supernovae , releasing enough energy to reheat the medium more or less uniformly to temperatures @xmath7  k , as we proceed to show .    assuming that a fraction  @xmath8 of the gas is turned into stars , that each unit of mass in stars gives rise ( over a short time scale of a few million years ) to @xmath9 type  ii supernovae each of which releases an energy @xmath10  erg , the energy released by supernovae per unit mass can be written as @xmath11 to account for radiative losses we further assume that the released energy is turned into thermal energy of the remaining ism with some efficiency @xmath12 .",
    "one can easily show that the temperature of the remaining gas then increases to @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the molecular weight ( which we take to be 0.6 ) , @xmath15 is the mass of the proton , @xmath16 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath17 is the stellar return fraction ( @xmath18 for `` standard '' initial mass functions ) , @xmath19 , and @xmath20  erg .",
    "in the last part of equation  ( [ q : t - rh ] ) we have assumed @xmath21 .",
    "we now give two reasons why @xmath22 must be small , resulting in an upper limit on @xmath23 .",
    "first , most of the stars that form at @xmath6 and are responsible for reheating the gas out of which disk galaxies later condense are expected to end up in the halos of these same galaxies ( cf .",
    "sommer - larsen et  al .",
    "@xcite ) ; as the mass of the stellar halo of the milky way is only about 1% of the total baryonic mass , @xmath24 . for a scalo ( @xcite ) `` best fit '' initial mass function ( imf ) , @xmath25 .",
    "so with @xmath26 one would expect , from equation  ( [ q : t - rh ] ) , that @xmath27  k. there are some indications ( kennicutt , tamblyn & congdon @xcite , sommer - larsen @xcite , tsujimoto et  al .",
    "@xcite ) that the global imf is more top - heavy than scalo s , implying @xmath28 . using this , and setting @xmath29 , a firm upper limit to @xmath23 is @xmath30  k. note , however , that if the early imf was extremely top - heavy ( and consequently @xmath31 ) the milky way stellar halo mass argument given above could be bypassed and one could in principle have @xmath32 and @xmath33  k.    the second , stronger argument is based on chemical evolution considerations , in particular the fact that oxygen is ejected only by type ii supernovae ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "beers & sommer - larsen ( @xcite ) found that the disk of the milky way extends down to very low metallicities : @xmath35 \\la -2 $ ] , or equivalently @xmath36",
    "\\la -1.5 $ ] as @xmath37 \\simeq 0.5 $ ] in galactic metal - poor stars .",
    "let @xmath38 be the mass of oxygen produced and ejected by a type ii supernova .",
    "its value is fairly insensitive to the imf : @xmath39 for a scalo imf and @xmath40 for a salpeter imf ( cf .",
    "pagel @xcite ) .",
    "these numbers are consistent with the observationally inferred value for sn 1987a .",
    "the oxygen abundance is then given by : @xmath41 where again we have made use of @xmath21 in the last part of equation  ( [ q : zi - o ] ) .",
    "it then follows that @xmath42 inserting this into equation  ( [ q : t - rh ] ) yields @xmath43 for @xmath14 = 0.6 and @xmath44 = 0.01 ( e.g. , pagel @xcite ) .",
    "this expression does not depend on the values of @xmath9 and @xmath17 , so it is a considerably more robust estimate of @xmath23 than what is obtained with the galactic stellar halo argument above .",
    "the existence of a very metal - weak tail of the galactic disk has been questioned ( ryan & lambert @xcite , chiba & yoshii @xcite ) , but there are other indications that the typical abundance produced by a ( hypothetical ) early phase of star formation ( `` population  iii '' ) is very low . in lyman",

    "there are even indications ( ostriker & gnedin @xcite , gnedin & ostriker @xcite , lu et  al .",
    "@xcite ) that population  iii enrichment is at least 1.5  dex lower than this .    at very high redshifts",
    "inverse compton cooling dominates .",
    "the cooling rate is given by ( ikeuchi & ostriker @xcite ) @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the number density of free electrons in units of @xmath51 .",
    "for a fully ionized , primordial plasma the inverse compton cooling timescale is given by @xmath52 which is independent of density and temperature .",
    "( @xmath53 is the hydrogen mass fraction ; we assume @xmath54 in our numerical estimates . ) for an @xmath55 , @xmath56   cosmology @xmath57 is comparable to the hubble time at @xmath58 . for @xmath59",
    "reheating is therefore ineffective .",
    "we consequently choose @xmath60 .",
    "an alternative to this diffuse reheating scenario is to assume that larger condensations do form early on , but that star formation activity is strong enough to expel the gas from these regions before they merge into larger objects ( dekel & silk @xcite ) .",
    "the gas then needs to cool and condense again , now more slowly and gradually since the mean density is lower .",
    "the most significant change is that the disk grows in a gentle cooling flow from a dilute , hot ( @xmath61  k ) corona rather than through mergers of inspiralling high - density clumps .",
    "the primary feedback process is supernova explosions , but stellar winds and uv radiation from massive stars also contribute to reheating the interstellar medium ( hellsten @xcite ) .    in this scenario",
    ", reheating occurs in a more patchy manner and radiative cooling is the main competing effect .",
    "unfortunately the balance between heating and cooling is very difficult to establish from first principles , since it depends strongly on the manner in which the energy from the stars is deposited into the ism .",
    "supernovae are thought to be largely responsible for maintaining the multiphase structure of the ism .",
    "this is an area of ongoing research , and best discussed in a separate paper .",
    "sommer - larsen , hellsten & vedel ( @xcite ) use a simplified treatment of the ism as a two - phase medium composed of a warm ( @xmath62  k ) and a hot ( @xmath61  k ) phase to show that supernova - driven hot gas outflows can be very efficient during the early stages of galaxy formation when the metallicity of the gas is low .    to illustrate why the multiphase structure of the ism can not be ignored for a proper treatment ,",
    "let us consider a schematic model similar to that used by various authors ( e.g. , katz @xcite , navarro & white @xcite , mihos & hernquist @xcite ) to represent star formation and feedback in numerical simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "let the star - formation rate in a dense gas cloud be given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 is an inverse star - formation efficiency parameter .",
    "the rate of sn explosion energy input into the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) is then given by @xmath67 in which @xmath9 and @xmath68 are defined as in equation  ( [ q : t - rh ] ) .",
    "the rate of radiative cooling per unit volume is written in terms of the _ cooling function _ @xmath69 as @xmath70 it is straightforward to show that the ratio of the rate of sn energy input to the rate of cooling in the gas cloud is @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is the hydrogen number density in units of @xmath51 .",
    "the balance @xmath76 between the rates of heating and cooling depends fairly sensitively on the mean effective density @xmath75 of the gas .",
    "katz ( @xcite ) found in his simulations that if the gas is treated as a single - phase medium ( of relatively high mean density in the star - forming regions ) that is heated more or less uniformly by feedback processes , then @xmath77 and the heat is quickly radiated away , resulting in no appreciable blow - out . on the other hand ,",
    "if the supernova energy is unevenly distributed and predominantly serves to heat a low - density gas phase , then it can only be radiated away over a much longer time scale , and the effect of multiple supernova explosions can be additive .    other mechanisms for local reheating have been proposed . for example , the radiation from a quasar located in the host protogalaxy could heat the surrounding gas . however , one can show that photoionization can not raise the gas temperature above @xmath78  k for any reasonable choice of quasar spectrum ( hellsten , private communication ) .",
    "compton heating has been discussed by krolik , mckee , & tarter ( @xcite ) .",
    "it might be important relatively close ( @xmath79  kpc ) to the quasar .",
    "more important , however , might be the effect of quasar winds , as discussed recently by silk & rees ( @xcite ) .",
    "note , however , that the comoving density of quasars peaks quite late , at @xmath80 ; it remains to be seen whether this is early enough for the reheating to be effective .",
    "we use the gridless lagrangian @xmath81-body and smoothed particle hydrodynamics code treesph described in vhsl94 , with only a minor change in the method by which the energy equation for the gas is solved .",
    "our treesph code is modeled after that of hernquist & katz ( @xcite ) .",
    "we include gas cooling and heating terms as in vhsl94 .",
    "the heating corresponds to a redshift - dependent , homogeneous and isotropic uvx background field .",
    "we assume a rather hard ( spectral index @xmath82 ) field @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the lyman limit frequency , with the redshift - dependent normalization @xmath85 ^ 4 } \\ ] ] of efstathiou ( @xcite ) . for",
    "greater realism one could build on the detailed study of haardt & madau ( @xcite ) , but our adopted background field is quantitatively not too dissimilar from theirs ( once allowance is made for our simplified spectral shape ) , at least at redshifts  @xmath2 , and should be adequate for the level of detail we can represent in the simulations .",
    "the code also incorporates inverse compton cooling ( equation  [ [ q : compton ] ] ) , which is also explicitly redshift - dependent .    due to the impossibility of properly representing the multiphase structure of the ism in an sph simulation at the level of resolution we can afford to run and to the lack of a clear physical basis ( or even of a reliable empirical calibration ) for schemes such as the kinetic energy feedback term of navarro & white ( @xcite ) , we do not attempt to follow star formation and feedback in the manner pioneered by katz ( @xcite ) .",
    "instead , we mimic feedback events occurring at well - defined epochs by instantaneously altering the state of the gas at that time , then continuing the simulation .",
    "this is adequate for our present purpose , which is to gain a qualitative insight into the effect of varying the epoch and manner of reheating rather than to pursue the much more ambitious and long - term goal of a fully realistic simulation .",
    "the simulations use artificial viscosity parameters @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "the smoothing length of each sph particle is adjusted so as to keep the number of neighbors close to  50 .",
    "our initial conditions are based on a standard ( @xmath55 , @xmath88 ) cold dark matter ( cdm ) model with hubble constant @xmath89 . on the scales of interest to us the effective index of the power spectrum is approximately  @xmath90 : @xmath91 . following eke , cole , & frenk ( @xcite ) we normalize the spectrum to @xmath92 , where as customary @xmath93 is the mass variance within spheres of comoving radius @xmath94  mpc , extrapolated from the linear regime of perturbation growth .",
    "we begin by performing a large - scale simulation within a sphere of comoving radius 40  mpc .",
    "individual halos are then selected from the final state and individually sampled at higher resolution .",
    "the original large - scale simulation is used to provide a tidal field acting on the resampled halos , which are evolved individually in a second round of simulations .",
    "approximately @xmath95 particles are initially placed on a cubic lattice within that sphere .",
    "position and velocity perturbations are then applied according to the zeldovich ( @xcite ) approximation .",
    "the perturbations consist of the superposition of @xmath96 plane waves sampling a gaussian random field with variance given by the power spectrum . following navarro & white ( @xcite ) we use an equal number of waves per logarithmic interval in @xmath97-space .",
    "the phases of these waves are random and only wavenumbers between the fundamental and nyquist wavenumber of the lattice are included .",
    "the initial redshift ( which determines the amplitude of the initial perturbations ) is @xmath98 .    the evolution of this system to @xmath99",
    "is then computed using a tree code .",
    "only gravitational forces are included in this first simulation . in the final state",
    "we identify four virialized , isolated halos with circular velocities between 200 and 260   in the innermost 20  mpc of the simulation .",
    "we expect that a significant fraction of such halos should host disk galaxies similar to the milky way since the circular velocities are in the same range and our halos were chosen to lie `` in the field '' , away from larger concentrations of mass .",
    "we adopt the customary working definition of the virial radius as the radius  @xmath100 of a sphere enclosing a mean density of 200 times the critical cosmic value . tracing the particles in these halos back to the initial conditions",
    ", we find that they all come from regions that fit within spheres of comoving radius @xmath101  mpc .",
    "each of these spheres at @xmath102 is then resampled with a lattice 4 times finer in each spatial dimension .",
    "each sphere contains about 7000 points of this new lattice .",
    "we assign one dark matter ( dm ) particle and two sph particles to each of these points .",
    "the sph particles are positioned at random within one gas gravitational softening length of their parent dm particle .",
    "note that at this redshift the dm particles are spaced by about 14  kpc , so that each sph particle is rather closely associated with its parent dm particle .",
    "table  [ t : np ] lists the precise number of sph and dm particles in each sphere .",
    "we adopt a baryonic mass fraction @xmath103 , consistent with nucleosynthesis constraints ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "this leads to masses of @xmath105 for the dm and @xmath106 for the sph particles .",
    "the sph particles are assigned an initial thermal energy corresponding to a temperature @xmath107  k. in order to include small - scale power that could not be sampled in the first simulation , we add shorter - wavelength plane waves in a way that preserves an equal number of waves per interval in  @xmath108 .",
    "we use stored intermediate results from the large cosmological simulation to provide a time - dependent tidal field acting on the resampled spheres .",
    "this is achieved by treating the original particles outside the resampled sphere as passive , interpolating their positions between successive snapshots of the original simulation and incorporating them into the particle tree that the code constructs on each step for the evaluation of gravitational forces .",
    "gravitational interactions between particles are softened according to the prescription of hernquist & katz ( @xcite ) , with softening lengths 3 kpc for the gas particles , 10 kpc for the dark matter particles , and 40  kpc for the `` passive '' dark matter particles that provide the tidal field from the original large - scale simulation .",
    "the gravitational softening lengths are kept constant in physical units throughout the evolution of the system .",
    "we carry out three sets of four simulations each . in what follows",
    ", the symbols @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 correspond to the four high - resolution spheres , and the subscripts @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 to the three sets of simulations .",
    "these subscripts stand respectively for `` passive '' , `` reheating '' , and `` blow - out '' .    in the @xmath113 simulations ,",
    "no stellar feedback is applied to the thermal history of the gas .",
    "the only non - adiabatic effects present ( aside from the usual shock - capturing artificial viscosity ) are radiative and inverse compton cooling , and heating through photoionization by the background uvx field .",
    "these simulations are meant to extend the results of vhsl94 to more realistic initial conditions than the uniform top - hat these authors used , as well as to provide a basis for assessing the effectiveness of our reheating experiments .    in the @xmath114 simulations ,",
    "the gas is reheated wholesale to a temperature of @xmath116  k at a redshift @xmath117 .",
    "( we have also performed a test simulation in which this reheating occurs at @xmath118 rather than @xmath117 , and found as expected that the heat was dissipated very quickly by inverse compton cooling .",
    "the final result was essentially indistinguishable from that of the corresponding `` passive '' simulation . )",
    "apart from this instantaneous reheating event , the system is evolved passively , exactly as in the @xmath113 runs .    in the @xmath115 simulations ,",
    "all cold ( @xmath119  k ) , relatively dense ( @xmath120 ) gas clumps are identified in the simulation at @xmath121 and their particles instantaneously redistributed uniformly within spherical shells between radii @xmath122 and @xmath123 around the center of mass of each clump . in other words , the gas is blown out but not blown away from the systems . here @xmath124 is the virial radius of the largest progenitor halo to the final object at that redshift ( @xmath125 ) , and @xmath4 a tuning factor of order unity .",
    "the results we present here were obtained with @xmath126 , but tests we have performed suggest that the results are not very sensitive to the precise value of this parameter . for robustness @xmath127 is not measured directly from the state of the simulation at @xmath121 but estimated from @xmath128 for the final halos ( at @xmath99 ) using the isothermal sphere approximation ( cf .",

    "no form of feedback is applied apart from this instantaneous event .",
    "the redshift @xmath121 is appropriate in our case because our simulations at that time contain a number of gas clumps of the requisite size ( namely the largest size of object for which blow - out can reasonably be expected to be significant ) , and these are about to merge into larger structures .",

    "it is closer to quadratic ( @xmath159 ) than linear .",
    "sommer - larsen , vedel , & hellsten ( @xcite ) interpret this as a consequence of the gravitational softening length being comparable to or larger than the extent of the disk .",
    "this indicates that the problem is actually even worse than figure  1 would imply , since the values of @xmath155 from the simulations are artificially inflated as an effect of gravitational softening .    in figure",

    "the angular momentum deficit is highly significant , and amounts to a factor of about 25 .",
    "this amount is broadly consistent with the findings of ns97 .",
    "( navarro , frenk , & white ( @xcite ) found a smaller factor of about 5 , but as discussed in ns97 this is probably due to resolution problems .",
    "the simulations we present here have nearly the same resolution as those of ns97 . )",
    "our `` reheating '' and `` blow - out '' simulations clearly reduce the gap with the observations ; the blow - out models are particularly encouraging .",
    "the deficit for the latter is only about a factor  5 , which can perhaps be accounted for by limitations in the numerical method . a detailed examination of the results of wee98 ( see especially their figures @xmath161 and  14 ) reveals that their stellar disks also lie below the observations by a similar factor .",
    "we are inclined to agree with them in considering this a success .",
    "besides the values of @xmath147 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 already mentioned , table  [ t : j ] lists our computed values for the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath164 ( column  4 ) evaluated at the _ infall radius _ @xmath165 ( column  6 ) .",
    "this radius is defined by @xmath166 , and is of order 100  kpc in all our runs .",
    "it represents the characteristic radius , at the present time , of the dark matter originally associated with the amount of gas currently in the disk . evaluating @xmath167 at @xmath100",
    "does not significantly affect the results .",
    "the spin parameters for our halos are consistent with the theoretical prediction of a broad distribution around @xmath168 ( barnes & efstathiou @xcite , heavens & peacock @xcite ) .",
    "the angular momentum deficit in our disks is therefore unlikely to be due to our having chosen an unrepresentative set of parent halos .",
    "the azimuthally averaged disk surface density profiles are shown in figure  [ f : sd - r - bo ] for the @xmath115 runs .",
    "the disks are close to exponential over a reasonable range of radii ( out to at least 4  kpc ) , with scale lengths of order 12  kpc .",
    "figure  [ f : vc - r - bo ] shows the rotation curves , recomputed from the particle distribution at @xmath99 under the assumption of negligible gravitational softening , for the same four runs . consistent with our previous observation that the angular momentum deficit has been reduced but not completely eliminated , there is still a hint of an excessive central concentration of mass in some of the runs , but the general behavior appears reasonably realistic otherwise .",
    "the most extended disk found in our simulations is that of @xmath169 .",
    "we show an edge - on view in figure  [ f : z - y - s4bo ] , and a face - on view ( with arrows to represent the velocity field ) in figure  [ f : y - x - s4bo ] .",
    "this disk extends beyond 10  kpc and exhibits a distinct warp in the outer regions .",
    "a spiral arm may even be discerned in the face - on view .",
    "we distinguish between a `` cold '' ( @xmath119  k ) and a `` hot '' ( @xmath170  k ) gas phase . in practice",
    "most of the `` hot '' gas in our simulations is much hotter ( @xmath61  k ) than our demarcation threshold , due to cooling times being short at intermediate temperatures and densities .",
    "the cold gas is in a rather dense state ( @xmath171 ) , while the hot gas is more dilute .",
    "we measure the amount of gas that has been accreted onto the central disk during each of the intervals @xmath172 $ ] between successive snapshots in our simulations .",
    "for the runs presented in this work the snapshots are evenly spaced with @xmath173 .",
    "the accreted material is classified as `` hot '' or `` cold '' according to its state at  @xmath174 .",
    "a quantity of interest is the fraction  @xmath175 of the total disk mass that was in the form of hot gas just before being accreted onto the existing cold disk . in figure",
    "[ f : jdisk - fhot ] we plot the specific angular momenta @xmath176 of the disks in the final state of our simulations against  @xmath175 .",
    "as one could have expected given the presence of an uvx background , @xmath175 is rather large for all our simulations ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "the simulations with reheating tend to have even higher values @xmath178 , reflecting the fact that the formation of cold clumps is suppressed at early times .",
    "while there is a clear trend in that on average the @xmath115 runs have both larger @xmath175 and larger @xmath179 than the @xmath114 runs , and the @xmath114 runs than the @xmath113 runs , the scatter in @xmath179 vs.  @xmath175 in each group of simulations is quite large . within each group",
    "there appears to be no correlation between @xmath179 and  @xmath175 .",
    "this reminds us that factors other than the thermodynamic state ( density and temperature ) of the accreted material play a role in determining the angular momentum of the disk .",
    "let us examine the history of angular momentum acquisition .",
    "in each time bin @xmath172 $ ] we compute the angular momentum of both the infalling material ( @xmath180 , where the @xmath181 s are unit vectors ) and the preexisting disk ( the unit vector of which at time  @xmath174 will be written  @xmath182 ) . in figure  [ f : jdisk - cos ] we plot the average @xmath183 over all time bins  @xmath184 for which data are available .",
    "the results are insensitive to whether only the hot gas ( filled symbols ) or all the accreted gas ( open symbols ) is used in determining  @xmath185 . as expected , the final angular momentum is larger in disks that have more coherent infall .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath115 runs appear to possess this property of experiencing coherent infall to a larger degree than the other sets of runs .",
    "the reason , we believe , is that much of the infalling material is material that has been `` blown out '' of a clump at some earlier time and retains the imprint of the orbital motion of its parent clump . in",
    "the @xmath113 runs , the same material would be accreted in a single event and cause an abrupt change in the angular momentum of the disk . in",
    "the @xmath115 runs , it is accreted over a longer period and thus @xmath186 already includes part of the realignment .",
    "figure  [ f : jdisk - sdcos ] shows the distribution of specific angular momenta  @xmath179 as a function of the dispersion @xmath187 in the angular momentum orientation of the infalling material .",
    "this dispersion is defined by @xmath188 with both means being taken over the time bins  @xmath184 , and measures the scatter in the orientation of @xmath185 .",
    "a perfectly isotropic distribution of @xmath185 would result in @xmath189 .",
    "this confirms the trend that the final angular momentum is reduced when the infall is disordered .    in two of",
    "the @xmath113 runs , the central object undergoes a major merger of cold gas , defined as an event in which the mass @xmath190 of cold gas gained during the last gyr is at least 30% of the current disk mass  @xmath191 .",
    "these runs are the ones that possess the smallest specific angular momenta .",
    "we plot the peak values of @xmath192 obtained during the evolution of each of our simulated systems in figure  [ f : jdisk - dmcold ] .",
    "the solid line on this plot shows the result of a linear least - squares fit , and confirms the visual impression that there is a ( negative ) correlation between major cold merger events and the final angular momentum of the disk .",
    "figure  [ f : jdisk - jinf ] shows @xmath179 versus the normalized total specific angular momentum of the infalling gas , @xmath193 , defined by @xmath194 if no angular momentum were lost or gained by the disk other than by accretion , we would expect @xmath163 to equal @xmath195 .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "the difference indicates that a significant part of the angular momentum is lost either during the last @xmath196  gyr before accretion or at the time of accretion .",
    "this happens even when almost all the gas is accreted as hot and dilute : the dependence of the angular momentum loss on the type ( @xmath113 , @xmath114 , or @xmath115 ) of model is much weaker than what we found in figure  [ f : jdisk ] for  @xmath179 .",
    "we suspect that this late loss of angular momentum is due to numerical transport effects as the sph particles get incorporated into the disk .",
    "if so , this contribution to the angular momentum loss ( a factor of about  4 ) is unlikely to have a physical counterpart .",
    "we should therefore consider our deficit of a factor of  5 in @xmath179 for the @xmath115 simulations ( figure  [ f : jdisk ] ) , and the similar result of wee98 , as a success in that no further unknown physical processes seem to be required .",
    "if instead of @xmath179 ( as in figure  [ f : jdisk ] ) we plot @xmath197 ( figure  [ f : jinf ] ) , the agreement in disk angular momentum between the simulated and observed systems becomes quite satisfactory for all of the @xmath115 runs and even for some @xmath114 and @xmath113 runs .",
    "one may wonder whether the large differences in @xmath195 between runs started from the same initial conditions is due to their somehow having accreted different material . to the extent that there are differences in the final disk masses @xmath138 ( table  [ t : mrv ] )",
    ", this must clearly be the case ; but as we have seen , the variation in @xmath138 does not show any discernible systematic trend . since most of the angular momentum is imparted by tidal torques in the course of the simulations ,",
    "it is not very instructive to compute the initial angular momentum of the gas that ends up in the disk .",
    "instead , we evaluate the analogue of @xmath195 for the dark matter initially associated with this gas , and ask whether this new quantity @xmath198 is in any way correlated with  @xmath199 .",
    "we plot @xmath200 against @xmath201 in figure  [ f : jinf - jinfdm ] .",
    "we find no evidence of a correlation .",
    "the same can be said of @xmath202 versus  @xmath201 in figure  [ f : jdisk - jinfdm ] .",
    "the connection between @xmath195 and  @xmath203 may of course have been washed out by angular momentum exchange between the dm particles in the halo , as well as by the divergence of orbits between dm and gas particles that were initially associated with each other .",
    "it is therefore equally instructive to compare @xmath197 to the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath167 of the final dark matter halo , computed both within  @xmath100 and within the baryonic infall radius  @xmath204 .",
    "we do this in figure  [ f : jdisk - lambda ] , and again find no signal .",
    "figure  [ f : jinfdm ] shows @xmath201 versus circular speed @xmath147 . as proposed by fe80",
    ", tidal torques appear to produce just enough specific angular momentum in the dark matter halos to be consistent with observations .",
    "this , however , requires that the gas associated with the dark matter contracted dissipatively to form galactic disks with at most a minor loss of angular momentum .",
    "figure  [ f : jinfdm - lambda ] shows @xmath201 ( computed for the dm associated with all infalling gas , both hot and cold ) versus the spin parameter @xmath167 of the dark matter halo evaluated at the baryonic infall radius .",
    "a trend of increasing @xmath201 with increasing @xmath167 is seen , supporting the proposal by fe80 that the spin parameter of a dark matter halo is an important parameter in determining the specific angular momentum of the disk galaxy formed in its central region .",
    "we have carried out treesph simulations of the formation of milky way - sized disk galaxies in a cosmological context .",
    "for the `` passive '' variant of such simulations , i.e. when the effects of stellar feedback processes are neglected , we confirm previous reports that the simulated disks are far too small ( by about a factor of  10 ) and poor in specific angular momentum ( by a factor of about  25 ) by comparison with observations of real galaxies . this is true even for simulations where 80% or more of the final mass of the disk is accreted from hot , dilute gas rather than mergers of cold clumps .",
    "these `` passive '' simulations are a natural extension of the work of vhsl94 , and by using cosmological initial conditions rather than isolated uniform spheres they remove an objection raised by ns97 against that work .",
    "uniform reheating of all the gas in the universe at @xmath1 , while reducing the angular momentum deficit to some extent , is not as effective as later blow - out of gas from a first generation of cold star - forming clouds , at least as long as the reheating temperature does not exceed @xmath116  k , which we estimate is a firm upper limit .",
    "this estimate is based mainly on chemical enrichment constraints , but it is worth noting that with some ( conservative ) assumptions on the initial mass function , one can get a similar bound from the mass of our galaxy s stellar halo .",
    "instantaneous blow - out ( at @xmath205 in our simulations ) , on the other hand , leads to a significant closing of the gap between observed and simulated values of the specific angular momentum .",
    "the remaining mismatch develops mostly in the late stages of gas infall and in the subsequent evolution of the disk , suggesting that it may be an artifact of artificial viscosity in the sph method .",
    "the success of the blow - out model appears related to the fact that the gas is accreted onto the central disk in a very gentle way , without abrupt changes of angular momentum orientation .",
    "there is no obvious difference in the angular momentum of the dark matter associated with the accreted gas between the different sets of simulations .",
    "there is still considerable room for improvement in our ability to simulate the formation of disk galaxies .",
    "some of it will depend on our ability to increase the numerical resolution .",
    "we have seen that the structure of the disks is affected by gravitational softening , and that much of the angular momentum is lost in the late phases of accretion .",
    "we plan to discuss this issue in detail in a future paper ; for now let us point out that the test of shear - free artificial viscosity presented in ns97 is incomplete , in that it only considers the abrupt collapse of cold gas , not the steady growth of the disk in a cooling flow ( which would be much more relevant to our simulations , and is also more in keeping with the widely held view that actual galactic disks formed by gradual accumulation of material ) .",
    "irregularities in the spatial arrangement of the sph particles in the transition region from the hot to the cold phase can also contribute to angular momentum transport , and shear - free artificial viscosity formulations are more vulnerable to such small - scale disorder ( in effect , the flow is more turbulent ) . while shear - free viscosity is undoubtedly helpful in preventing further secular evolution within an already settled disk , increased numerical resolution may be the only truly effective way of improving the solution in the transition region from the hot halo to the cold disk .",
    "it would also be very tempting to incorporate star formation into the simulations in a more direct way , as other authors have done , by converting some of the gas mass into new `` stellar '' collisionless particles whose orbits are then integrated explicitly . to be consistent with observations of the stellar content of our own galaxy ,",
    "the bulk of this conversion should only occur after the gas has settled into the disk .",
    "a natural expectation is that this conversion might allow more of the angular momentum in the disk to be retained , since the stellar component is not subject to artificial viscous effects .",
    "however , the results of steinmetz & navarro ( @xcite ) suggest to us that this effect is not sufficiently strong to make a significant difference to the results , at least in the situation they considered ( which did not include any particular mechanisms for delaying gas cooling and star formation ) .",
