    "antikaon - nucleon dynamics close to threshold ( @xmath8=1.43 gev ) appears rather complex .",
    "the @xmath9 channel in that regime couples both to inelastic channels ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and to baryon resonances located below and above threshold .",
    "the baryon resonances present below threshold [ @xmath4(1385 ) and @xmath5(1405 ) ] are strongly coupled to the hyperon - pion channels .",
    "the @xmath12 decays primarily into the @xmath13 channel [ ( @xmath14 and less significantly [ ( @xmath15 into the @xmath16 channel @xcite . the @xmath17 decays entirely into the @xmath16 channel @xcite .",
    "we propose to study the @xmath6 and @xmath7 amplitudes below threshold , in the region where they are dominated by the @xmath4(1385 ) and @xmath5(1405 ) resonances , by isolating a specific term arising from @xmath18 t - channel exchange in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions induced by 2 gev photons .",
    "this term is characterized by its analytic structure , a double pole linked to the @xmath18 propagator [ 1/@xmath19 , fulfills the requirement of gauge - invariance and seems to be important .",
    "this work is largely motivated by a new generation of experiments in which multihadron final states can be measured exclusively .",
    "section 2 is devoted to a brief review of these experimental projects .",
    "we describe in section 3 the calculation of the t - channel k@xmath20-exchange contribution to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions using the @xmath6 and @xmath7 amplitudes obtained in ref .",
    "we extract the gauge - invariant double @xmath18 pole contribution for both processes .",
    "a few numerical results for the @xmath21 and @xmath22 reactions based on the double k@xmath20 pole term are presented in section 4 .",
    "we conclude briefly in section 5 .",
    "this talk is based on a recent paper @xcite to which we refer for a more extensive account of our calculation and a broader presentation of the results .",
    "very little is presently known on the @xmath21 and @xmath22 reactions induced by real photons in the region where the invariant mass of the @xmath23 or @xmath24 pairs is close to the @xmath4(1385 ) or @xmath5(1405 ) mass .",
    "the only published data of relevance for these processes were obtained at desy thirty years ago with space - like photons , in electroproduction experiments where the scattered electron and the produced k@xmath25 were detected in coincidence @xcite .",
    "the differential cross sections for the @xmath26 reaction in these measurements characterize globally strangeness production processes for hyperon missing masses ranging from 1.35 until 1.45 gev .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath17 channel can not be separated , so that the published cross sections are associated with the production of both resonances .",
    "an interesting trend of these data is that the t - dependence of the cross section , for given photon energy and virtuality , seems to show a sharp drop as would be expected if the dynamics were dominated by t - channel exchanges .",
    "it is best fitted precisely by the double kaon pole [ 1/@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the mandelstam variable t is defined as the square of the 4-momentum transfer from the proton target to the @xmath12 or @xmath17 .",
    "we caution that these electroproduction data have very large error bars and should be viewed as an mere indication that our suggestion is not in contradiction with existing experimental information .",
    "there are on the other hand ongoing and future programs pertaining directly to the study of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 reactions , where the resonances will be separated .",
    "the @xmath12 decays into neutral ( @xmath2 ) and charged ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) channels ; its decay into a @xmath29 pair is forbidden .",
    "the @xmath17 decays into all @xmath24 channels ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) .",
    "the @xmath30 decay is therefore a unique signature of the @xmath17 .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath31 reaction is intended at elsa ( bonn ) where the @xmath30 pair could be detected through a multi - photon final state ( @xmath32 ) with the crystal barrel @xcite .",
    "similarly the @xmath12 could be studied by its @xmath13 decay into the @xmath33 channel .",
    "the charged channels were also studied at elsa with the saphir detector .",
    "the @xmath34 and the @xmath35 reactions ( where all charged hadrons are detected ) have been investigated in the energy range 1.3@xmath362.6 gev @xcite .",
    "the charged channels are also presently studied at spring-8/leps with incident photon energies in the range 1.5@xmath37 gev @xcite .",
    "the analysis of both the saphir and leps data is in progress .",
    "these data are dominated by effects arising from the presence of the @xmath17 resonance .",
    "we expect these data to be quite accurate and to unravel the dynamics underlying the @xmath12 and @xmath17 production for photon laboratory energies ranging from threshold kinematics until the 2 gev region addressed in this work .",
    "angular or t - distributions in successive energy bins should carry that information .",
    "the dynamics of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 reactions in the region where the invariant mass of the @xmath23 or @xmath24 pairs is close to the @xmath4(1385 ) and @xmath5(1405 ) masses reflects the nature of these resonances .",
    "the @xmath4(1385 ) arises as a member of the ground state decuplet of baryons in the large n@xmath38 limit of qcd .",
    "it is well described by quark models @xcite and has a breit - wigner shape @xcite .",
    "the @xmath17 is a complex baryonic state .",
    "its mass , in particular the large splitting between the @xmath39 and the @xmath40 , can not be understood in the constituent quark model with residual quark - quark interactions fitting the other low - lying baryonic states @xcite .",
    "sizeable @xmath41 components seem required @xcite .",
    "the @xmath17 has been described as a bound kaon - nucleon system @xcite , in particular as a kaon - soliton bound state @xcite .",
    "the @xmath42 nature of the @xmath17 was also inferred from the su(3 ) cloudy bag model description @xcite .",
    "extensive studies of the @xmath17 based on chiral lagrangians @xcite suggest that this resonance is generated by meson - baryon interactions .",
    "the spectral shape of the @xmath17 departs from a breit - wigner @xcite .",
    "it depends strongly on the initial and final states through which it is measured , emphasizing the need for a full understanding of the coupling of the @xmath17 to its different decay channels .",
    "we study the @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions with the idea of using future accurate data on these processes ( mainly t - distributions ) to gain understanding of the @xmath6 and of the @xmath7 amplitudes below the @xmath42 threshold , where they are dominated by the @xmath43 and @xmath17 resonances .",
    "this procedure requires that these reactions be significantly driven by the process in which the ingoing photon dissociates into a real k@xmath25 and a virtual k@xmath20 , the off - shell k@xmath20 scattering subsequently off the proton target to produce the @xmath13 or @xmath16 pair .",
    "the corresponding diagrams are displayed in fig .  1 .",
    "such dynamics would show in a sharp drop of the differential cross sections @xmath44 with increasing @xmath45 ( as suggested by the scarce data available @xcite ) .",
    "this drop can have both a double pole component behaving like 1/@xmath46 and a single pole dependence going like 1/@xmath47 .",
    "the new data expected in the near future should make it possible to separate these terms by expressing the differential cross sections @xmath44 as a superposition of double and single k@xmath20 pole terms and less singular contributions . to support further our t - channel approach",
    ", it should be noted that there are no reasons to expect significant s - channel contributions to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions at e@xmath48 gev .",
    "the corresponding total center of mass energy is @xmath49 gev .",
    "there are no baryon resonances in that mass range known to decay into the @xmath50 or @xmath51 channels .",
    "effects from u - channel contributions are not expected at low t.    0.4 true cm    0.4 true cm    we have computed the k@xmath20-exchange graphs of fig .",
    "1 using the chiral coupled - channel approach of kaon - nucleon scattering developed in ref . @xcite .",
    "the different nature of the @xmath43 and of the @xmath17 resonances is part of that picture .",
    "the baryon resonances belonging to the large n@xmath38 ground state baryon mutiplets ( hence the @xmath43 ) are introduced explicitly as fundamental fields of the effective lagrangian .",
    "the other baryon resonances ( in particular the @xmath17 ) are generated dynamically by meson - baryon coupled - channel dynamics .",
    "this effective field theory achieves an excellent description of the available data on @xmath52 elastic ( direct and charge - exchange ) and inelastic ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) processes up to laboratory @xmath18 momenta of the order of 500 mev .",
    "the interest of the present work is to offer the possibility of testing the amplitudes below the @xmath42 threshold , in the region where they are dominated by the @xmath5(1405 ) and the @xmath4(1385 ) .",
    "the specific spectral shape of these resonances is a particularly meaningful prediction of the description of ref .",
    "@xcite    we calculate the cross section for the @xmath57 , where y represents either the @xmath58 or the @xmath59 .",
    "the 4-momenta of the photon , the proton , the k@xmath25 , the pion and the hyperon are denoted by @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively .",
    "the photon , proton and hyperon polarizations are indicated by the symbols @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the total cross section reads @xmath68 factorizing the full amplitude @xmath69 into the photon - kaon vertex and the @xmath70 amplitude , we can express the @xmath71 cross section in terms of the @xmath70 cross section @xcite .",
    "the latter is frame - independent and calculated for simplicity in the @xmath52 center of mass .",
    "it is useful to define the invariant mass @xmath72 of the final @xmath73 pair by @xmath74    the expression for the total @xmath75 cross section is given by @xmath76 in which @xmath77 is the @xmath18 momentum in the @xmath78 center of mass , @xmath79 and the amplitudes @xmath80 are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the energy range under consideration ( e@xmath48 gev )",
    ", there are many possible diagrams contributing to the @xmath81 amplitudes and involving poorly known couplings and hence large uncertainties .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath69 obtained by calculating the graphs of fig .",
    "1 are not gauge - invariant . to obtain the full gauge - invariant amplitudes , a large class of diagrams of order @xmath82 leading to the same final state should be added .",
    "we do not attempt to calculate these graphs and resort instead to the pole scheme method @xcite .",
    "the idea of the method is to decompose the amplitude according to its pole structure and to expand it around the pole . to any order in perturbation theory ,",
    "the residues of the poles are gauge - invariant .",
    "we apply this method to derive the gauge - invariant cross section corresponding to the double k@xmath20-pole term .",
    "the key point is that the graphs of fig .",
    "1 are the only process which can contribute to the double k@xmath20-pole term",
    ". we will therefore decompose the corresponding cross section according to its pole structure , keep only the double k@xmath20-pole term and extract the gauge - invariant cross section associated with that pole structure by calculating the residue at the pole .    according to this procedure ,",
    "the gauge - invariant cross section corresponding to the double k@xmath20-pole term reads @xmath83    we stress that the double pole term is the only one which can be determined this way , because it does not get contributions from any other graph but the t - channel kaon - exchange diagram .    in order to be able to extract the double pole term from accurate t - distributions",
    ", it has to be reasonably large .",
    "we speculate so in view of the numerical results displayed in the next section . as mentioned earlier and discussed more thoroughly in ref .",
    "@xcite , the double pole behaviour is also compatible with the few data points available .",
    "we show first the quantity @xmath84 @xmath85 as function of the total center of mass energy in the @xmath86 system , renamed for clarity @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "the interest of displaying our results this way is to exhibit the behaviour of the @xmath89 cross section across threshold .",
    "we recall that the @xmath42 threshold is at @xmath901.435 gev .",
    "we present for example in fig .",
    "2 our predicted cross sections for the @xmath91 and @xmath92 reactions .",
    "they are compared to the data available on these processes above threshold @xcite .",
    "we recall that the @xmath93 channel reflects the @xmath5(1405 ) and the @xmath94 channel the @xmath4(1385 ) .",
    "the properties of the spectral functions of the @xmath4(1385 ) and @xmath5(1405 ) resonances are very apparent in fig .  2 .",
    "the shape of the resonant behaviour of the @xmath92 cross section below threshold is quite symmetric and close to a breit - wigner form .",
    "the s - wave contribution is small as expected for a process dominated by a p - wave resonance .",
    "in contrast , the spectral form of the @xmath91 cross section is asymmetric and largely given by s - wave dynamics , reflecting the @xmath5(1405 ) dominance .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "3 the double kaon pole term contributions to the differential cross sections for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions as functions of the @xmath95 total center of mass energy @xmath87 at @xmath96 gev .",
    "we see clearly the dynamical features discussed in commenting on fig .",
    "it is also interesting to note the absolute values of the double kaon pole cross sections .",
    "they are large on the scale of what is expected from other theoretical approaches . if we compare our results to the predictions of the model of ref .",
    "@xcite at @xmath97 gev , we notice that our calculated cross sections at that energy are roughly twice larger for the @xmath98 channels @xcite .",
    "it is not easy to trace the origin of this effect .",
    "our gauge - invariant double kaon pole term contains contributions which can not be mapped easily onto the feynman diagrams computed in ref .",
    "the cross section we obtain for the @xmath53 channel is about an order of magnitude larger than the result displayed in ref .",
    "a substantial part of this effect should be ascribed to the neglect of the @xmath4(1385 ) resonance in that work .",
    "we have studied the @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions in the kinematic region where the @xmath2(1116 ) and @xmath3(1192 ) pairs originate dominantly from the decay of the @xmath4(1385 ) and @xmath5(1405 ) resonances .",
    "we focus on laboratory photon energies around 2 gev , significantly above the threshold for producing the @xmath99(1385 ) ( e@xmath100=1.41 gev ) and the @xmath101(1405 ) ( e@xmath100=1.45 gev ) final states .",
    "we have calculated the t - channel @xmath18-exchange contribution to these reactions using the @xmath89 amplitudes of ref .",
    "@xcite , which have been shown to describe the data available at low kaon momentum . based on the pole structure of this contribution",
    ", we determined the gauge - invariant double kaon pole contribution to the @xmath102 cross sections by calculating the residue at the pole .",
    "the relevance of our work stems from the advent of detector systems able to measure exclusively multiparticle final states with great accuracy .",
    "three complementary experiments in the photon energy range considered in this paper are planned with leps at spring-8 @xcite , saphir at elsa @xcite and the crystal barrel at elsa @xcite , dealing for the first two with the charged [ @xmath28 and @xmath27 ] channels and for the latter with the neutral [ @xmath29 and @xmath2 ] final states .",
    "these accurate measurements should make it possible to extract the contribution of the double kaon pole and hence to study kaon - nucleon dynamics below threshold .",
