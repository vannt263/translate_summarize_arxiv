    "since the prediction of the existence of hot gas in the interstellar medium ( ism ) by spitzer ( 1956 ) and its subsequent detection by bowyer , field and mack ( 1968 ) in soft x - ray emission , a variety of models have been developed which attempt to explain the source of this gas , and how it evolves over time .",
    "the three dominant types of model , galactic fountain models ( @xcite ) , three phase models ( @xcite ) , and isolated supernova type models ( @xcite ) , all claim some measure of success in fitting the existing observations .    in the past several decades",
    ", measurements of interstellar absorption in the far ultraviolet ( fuv ) spectra of many stars using copernicus and iue ( jenkins 1978a&b , savage & massa 1987 ) have resulted in the detection of many highly ionized species .",
    "more recently the goddard high resolution spectrometer ( ghrs ) on the hubble space telescope , and the berkeley fuv / euv spectrometer on orfeus ( @xcite ) have provided additional data in this area .",
    "absorption measurements are fairly insensitive to the distribution of absorbing material along the line of sight and do not provide enough information to distinguish between various models of the ism .",
    "emission from the ism , though difficult to detect , has been the subject of various investigations .",
    "martin and bowyer ( 1990 ) investigated emission in the fuv between 1300 and 1800 using the space shuttle - borne uvx experiment .",
    "they detected civ 1548,1551 and oiii ] 1661,1666 emission along several lines of sight .",
    "several attempts have been made to measure diffuse line emission between 900 and 1200 .",
    "voyager observations made by holberg produced an upper limit of about @xmath2 for ovi   1032,1038 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , these voyager observations have recently been called into question by edelstein , bowyer and lampton ( 1997 ) .",
    "a similar limit for the ovi  doublet of @xmath3 was also reached by edelstein and bowyer ( 1993 ) .",
    "more recently dixon _ et al .  _",
    "( 1996 ) used the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) to search for diffuse fuv emission .",
    "they observed ten lines of sight at high galactic latitude and claim detections of ovi   emission along four of the ten lines of sight .",
    "_ determined that the ovi  they measured was consistent with temperatures and pressures which are as much as an order of magnitude higher than those determined by martin and bowyer s civ measurements .",
    "therefore they concluded that the ovi  they saw was produced by gas that is distinct from that which produces civemission .",
    "we have designed an instrument capable of measuring the important ovi   1032,1038 emission from the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "the instrument s small bandpass ( 150 ) around the ovi  lines also includes the potentially important ciii 977 , niii 991 , and cii 1037 lines .",
    "many problems need to be solved in the design of a diffuse spectrometer for this bandpass .",
    "the low predicted intensity of these emission lines requires that the spectrometer have a high effective area @xmath4 solid angle product .",
    "in addition , sources of instrument background and spectral contamination must be limited .",
    "we discuss , in turn , important sources of background and the techniques used to mitigate them .",
    "there are several bright airglow lines which could interfere with attempts to observe the faint ovi   1032,1038 lines .",
    "predictions of ovi  emission indicate the intensity of these line should be near 5000 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the airglow lines nearest to the ovi  doublet , hi 1025 and oi 1027 , have a combined intensity of about @xmath5 . assuming gaussian line profiles , it can be shown that a spectral resolution of 2.7 half - energy width ( hew ) is required if the contribution to a bin at 1032 is to contain less than 5000 equivalent background due to these lines .",
    "for this reason , high spectral resolution is required to prevent contamination of the faint interstellar emission lines .",
    "an even more troubling background source is the far brighter hi 1216 line . with an intensity of 5 kiloraleighs ( 4 ) , scattering within the instrument",
    "could easily swamp any signals .",
    "hi 1216 photons have to be rejected to a level of 5 per spectral bin or less to have an equivalent contribution of 5000 .",
    "unfortunately no filter material exists which is able to block hi 1216 while allowing ovi   1032,1038 to pass .",
    "a double spectrometer method was used to limit hi 1216 scattering as described below .",
    "another potential contaminant in the diffuse fuv spectrum is stellar flux .",
    "bright o , b , and a stars can be eliminated simply by not pointing the instrument near any known bright stars of this type .",
    "emission from later fuv emitting stars is more difficult to deal with .",
    "we designed our instrument with imaging along the slit to allow identification of stellar signals .",
    "we also used an additional detector which provided an fuv image of the spectrometer field .",
    "this allowed detection of stars too faint to be seen directly in the spectra .",
    "a background due to exospheric charged particles is potentially quite substantial .",
    "this background can range from 1 to upwards of for an open faced microchannel plate detector .",
    "it is highly dependent on orbital parameters , especially ram angle , solar angle , altitude and position over the earth s surface . in our instrument",
    ", the entrance aperture is covered with a fine mesh charged to + 28 volts to limit the number of exospheric charged particles that can reach the detector .",
    "in addition , an opaque shutter was employed to provide an in - flight determination of the entire non - photonic background .",
    "the instrument , designated duve , the diffuse ultraviolet experiment , is based on a spectrometer previously developed by edelstein and bowyer ( 1993 ) .",
    "however , the duve instrument s capability for studying diffuse radiation was substantially improved .",
    "the basic design is a two stage spectrometer which solves many of the background problems described above , yet provides a large area @xmath4 solid angle product when compared to alternative designs .",
    "a schematic of the instrument is shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the first stage of the spectrometer filters out unwanted wavelengths , most notably hi 1216 .",
    "light entering the spectrometer passes through a wire grid collimator with a full width of @xmath6 . after passing through the collimator ,",
    "the light strikes a diffraction grating in wadsworth configuration .",
    "first order light from the grating is focused toward a slit .",
    "the slit width defines the horizontal ( across the slit ) sky acceptance angle .",
    "contrary to intuition , this slit does not limit the instrument bandwidth .",
    "the collimator s angular width and the wadsworth grating ruling density define the width of the instrument bandpass . each individual wavelength accepted by the slit has entered the collimator at a slightly different angle .",
    "this has the unique advantage of limiting contamination by a bright star to a wavelength range much smaller than the overall bandpass .",
    "the second stage of the spectrometer is a dispersion stage .",
    "light entering through the slit strikes a holographically corrected diffraction grating in a rowland circle configuration .",
    "the second order diffracted light from the grating is focused onto a microchannel plate detector .",
    "use of second order light in the diffraction stage allows high dispersion without significantly increasing the line density required to achieve the required spectral resolution .",
    "the spectral resolution of the second stage is determined by properties of the diffraction grating and the width of the entrance slit .",
    "unwanted orders are blocked in this stage of the spectrometer through use of strategically placed baffles .",
    "they are specifically designed to eliminate all orders of hi 1216 which may have been scattered through the entrance slit .",
    "extensive calibration of the duve instrument was carried out using the euv / fuv calibration facilities at the space sciences laboratory ( @xcite ) .",
    "the details of this calibration are beyond the scope of this paper , but are described in detail by korpela ( 1997 ) . in brief , all the components needed to calculate the effective ( efficiency@xmath4area@xmath4solid angle ) product ( the instrument grasp ) were measured at a variety of wavelengths .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig9 ] .",
    "the spectral resolution was also measured .",
    "the instrument was found to have a hew of 3.5 at 1025 .",
    "however , the line profile was found to be asymmetric with a much steeper cutoff toward long wavelengths .",
    "consequently the contribution of hi 1025 into a spectral bin at 1032 is the same as an equivalent symmetric line with an hew of 2.3 .",
    "the imaging focus along the slit was also measured and was found to be @xmath7 arc minutes hew .",
    "the duve instrument was launched as a secondary payload attached to the second stage of a delta ii 7925 vehicle on 24 july , 1992 . as a secondary payload ,",
    "the parameters of the duve orbit were determined by the requirements of the primary payload , the geotail satellite .",
    "the orbital apogee was 1460 km which placed the instrument well above the majority of atomic oxygen airglow and above about half of the expected geocoronal hydrogen airglow",
    ".    due to safety requirements , the propellant and control gases of the second stage had to be depleted by the end of the first orbit .",
    "therefore the mission was conducted in two phases , a pointed phase for the first orbit , and a spin stabilized phase thereafter . because the duve data were telemetered through the second stage telemetry system , the mission lifetime for duve was limited by the battery power available to the telemetry system ( about 8 hours total ) .    during the first orbital night",
    ", the instrument was pointed at the primary target and a slow drift ( 0.1 min@xmath8 perpendicular to the slit ) was initiated .",
    "this phase continued until t+5000 seconds , at which time second stage spin up was begun .",
    "observations continued throughout this period , however , much of the data were contaminated by stars and bright airglow .",
    "the primary target was an area of low neutral hydrogen column density and enhanced soft x - ray emission near @xmath9 , @xmath10 . because of the spin and its precession throughout the orbit , @xmath11 steradians of sky was sampled during the observations .    in flight ,",
    "overall background rates ranged from 1 to 20 with a median value of 2 , indicating that the methods employed to reduce the background in the instrument were quite successful .",
    "overall , our backgrounds consisted of roughly equal parts charged particle background and intrinsic detector background .",
    "no scattered hi 1216 was detected .",
    "detector images ( 256 pixels spectral @xmath4 32 pixels imaging ) were telemetered from the spacecraft during ground station contacts .",
    "these images were telemetered multiple times over many ground station passes , hence , many data dropouts were able to be corrected .",
    "the end result was 19 images obtained from 4151 seconds of observation time .",
    "these images were examined for stellar contamination , uncorrected data dropouts and instrument anomalies and the affected portions were masked off or otherwise corrected . where no correction was possible , the images were discarded .",
    "the sky and shuttered background images are accumulated in an interleaved fashion , each sky image has a corresponding background image .",
    "the telemetered images were ordered in terms of count rate in the background image .",
    "we then determined whether adding the next higher background image to the summed low noise set would decrease the overall noise rate ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "fifteen of the images passed this test .",
    "the background level of those images ranged from 1.0 to 2.6 @xmath13 s@xmath8 .",
    "the background levels of those rejected ranged from 8.2 to 20 @xmath13 s@xmath8 .",
    "the resulting sum of the accepted images is shown in figure  [ fig11 ] .",
    "the top image is a sum of shutter opened images .",
    "the vertical stripe is hi 1025 airglow .",
    "the bottom is a sum of the corresponding shutter closed images .",
    "the image has not been corrected for distortions .",
    "the summed image was corrected for image distortions and shutter open / closed time , and the background image was subtracted from the data .",
    "the resulting image was histogrammed and convolved with a line spread function that was determined during calibration .",
    "the convolved histogram is shown in figure  [ fig12 ] .",
    "the dashed lines represent @xmath14 error levels as determined through count statistics and the error in the determination of the shutter open / closed time .",
    "this quantity is determined by : @xmath15 the quantities @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the number of counts ( post - convolution ) per wavelength bin in the sky and background images respectively .",
    "the values @xmath18 and @xmath19 represent the shutter open and shutter closed integration times ( 1582.6 and 1529.2 s ) and @xmath20 represents the uncertainty in those times ( 14.0 s ) .",
    "the hatched area near the baseline in figure  [ fig12 ]  represents the approximate fraction of the error that is due to potential errors in shutter timing .",
    "it can easily be seen that only one spectral line exceeds the @xmath21 significance level .",
    "that line is the geocoronal hi 1025 line . by dividing the count rate in this line by the duve grasp , we determined its intensity .",
    "the 1.31 counts per second detected corresponds to an intensity of @xmath22 as expected this value is between that measured at low altitude ( 600 km ) ( @xcite ) and the interplanetary value ( @xcite ) .",
    ".upper limits to line emission placed by the duve data [ cols=\"^,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the predicted ovi  intensities and the limits to mass flow rates in each of these models is shown in table  [ tab5 ] .",
    "although the duve data are able to place constraints to the models discussed above , it is important to note that the model parameters are sufficiently flexible , the duve data alone can not rule them out .",
    "the patchy distribution of the emitting gas in the galactic fountain and smith and cox models makes it possible , if somewhat unlikely , that the distribution of gas along the martin and bowyer lines of sight bears no resemblance to that sampled by the duve observations .",
    "observations of both civand ovi  emission along the same line of sight would be extremely useful .",
    "the predicted distribution of these emissions varies from highly pole brightened ( galactic fountain ) to fairly uniform ( mo models ) to plane brightened ( smith and cox ) , thus an all sky spectral survey of diffuse fuv emission would greatly enhance our understanding of the ism .",
    "we designed and built an instrument for the study of emission from the diffuse ism at wavelengths between 950 and 1080 .",
    "this instrument was flown on july 24 , 1992 attached to the second stage of a delta ii launch vehicle .",
    "it achieved orbit and operated as planned , providing 4151 seconds of observations during orbital night periods .",
    "observations made by the duve instrument did not detect emission from the hot phase of the interstellar medium .",
    "we were , however , able to place new upper limits to emission from ovi   1032,1038 , cii 1037 , ciii 977 , and niii 971 which significantly constrain the parameters of the hot ism .",
    "we have used these limits to determine constraints to the emission measure of both local and halo gas between @xmath2 and @xmath1 k.    we have modeled ovi  and civemission from scattered supernovae and compared the results to our observations .",
    "our model predicts emission at levels below the previously measured civvalues and the ovi  limits reported here .",
    "we have modeled ovi  and civemission from clouds in a standard mckee ostriker model .",
    "the produced emission in this model is also below the duve ovi  upper limits and the previously measured civvalues .",
    "we have placed limits to the filling factor of the hot medium versus its temperature .",
    "we are able to place limits to the base temperatures and isochoric transition temperatures in simple galactic fountain models .",
    "our observations are inconsistent with the i[ovi  ] /i[civ ] ratios predicted by simple galactic fountain models with base gas temperatures of above about @xmath23k .",
    "our observations are consistent with galactic fountain models with lower temperatures",
    ". our observations place limits to the mass flow rates of several galactic fountain models .",
    "we would like to thank michael lampton for his assistance with many aspects of this project , charlie gunn at nasa / ols for providing the opportunity for this mission , the staff of the space sciences lab and the mcdonnell douglas delta program office for their assistance .",
