    "in heavy ion collisions at very high energies , the matter created differs qualitatively from what is traditionally studied in nuclear and elementary particle physics . in the initial stages of the collision , copious production of gluons and quarks in a large volume",
    "leads to a rapid increase in the entropy , and the distinct possibility of a new phase of matter characterized by deconfined degrees of freedom .",
    "one therefore hopes that relativistic heavy ion experiments can provide insight into the structure of the qcd vacuum , deconfinement , and chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "the hot transient system eventually evolves into a gas of hadrons at high energy densities , whose properties may be studied theoretically using , for example , hadronic cascades @xcite . in principle , these models provide information on the early , dense phase by tracing the evolution of the system from hadronization to freeze  out .",
    "of course , in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions , most the of the produced secondaries are pions .",
    "for example , in central au+au collisions at center  of  mass energies of @xmath0 estimates from the fritiof event generator suggest that @xmath1 pions per isospin state might be produced .",
    "further , recent measurements @xcite at lower energies and comparison to simulations @xcite show that freeze  out source sizes probably deviate quite drastically from a simple multiplicity scaling law : present calculations indicate @xmath2@xmath3 au+au source radii at @xmath4 .",
    "in any event , these high energy collisions might well create highly degenerate bose systems , and even possibly bose  einstein condensates ( bec ) . since practical conclusions from dynamical simulations @xcite depend qualitatively on the effect of the medium on particle interactions @xcite , one needs to better understand the properties of such degenerate systems of pions within the environment of a relativistic heavy ion collision .",
    "non  relativistically , the problem of interacting , degenerate bose systems has been discussed extensively by several authors .",
    "evans and imry @xcite established the pairing theory of a bose superfluid in analogy to the bcs theory of superconductivity . for an attractive interaction ,",
    "the resulting gap equation may have a non  trivial solution .",
    "further , though , there appears the possibility of having a macroscopic occupation of the @xmath5 particle state when the corresponding bcs quasiparticle energy vanishes . in turn",
    ", this leads to a spectrum which is linear and gapless in the long wavelength limit @xcite . in a second paper , evans and rashid @xcite rederived the equations of ref .",

    "an extensive discussion on the boson pairing problem is also given by nozires and saint james @xcite .",
    "it has further been shown by stoof @xcite and , independently , chanfray _",
    "_ @xcite that the critical temperature @xmath6 for the transition from the normal phase to the phase with a non  vanishing gap ( the evans ",

    "we address the question of pion pair formation and the pion dispersion relation in a thermal medium , first in a qualitative way ( section ii ) , then in a more detailed numerical calculation with a realistic two pion interaction ( section iii ) .",
    "as we shall see in section iv , the in  medium @xmath10 propagator exhibits a pole above a certain critical temperature , signaling a possible instability with respect to pion pair formation .",
    "we conclude in section v with a discussion of the effect in high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "the effects we present here require rather large phase space densities for the pions , but are independent of whether full thermal equilibration has been reached . nonetheless , we choose to couch the discussion in terms of thermal language , because it is convenient , but also because the actual situation is probably not too far removed from it .",
    "dynamical calculations @xcite show that a high degree of thermal equilibration is quite reasonable .",
    "chemical equilibration , on the other hand , may well cease at later stages of the system s evolution and lead to a condensation of pions in the adiabatic limit .",
    "of course , the system actually expands rather rapidly , but nonetheless large chemical potentials ( @xmath11 ) may be built up by freezeout ( @xmath12 ) . one might thus expect large phase space occupation numbers at low momenta , which drive the pion pair formation that we discuss here .",
    "in order to treat the gas of interacting pions we will use the boson pairing theory of evans _ et al .",
    "in analogy to the fermion ( bcs ) case , they obtain a system of coupled equations for the gap energy and the density by linearizing the equations of motion . the usual thouless criterion for fermions",
    "can be established analogously for the bose system , and yields the critical temperature below which the gap equation begins to exhibit non  trivial solutions . however",
    ", in contrast to the fermion case , a second , lower , critical temperature appears at which the quasiparticle energy vanishes at zero momentum .",

    "we also see a threshold behavior in fig .  4 : as @xmath110 becomes larger , a resonance peak emerges from below the threshold which continues to shift up in energy and strengthen until it coincides with the free scattering peak .",
    "we shall see below that this is the continuation of an upward shift of the cooper pole in the @xmath7matrix with decreasing phase space occupation @xcite.[concern2 ]    we consider now the existence of poles in the @xmath7matrix , first for the special case of zero total momentum , @xmath104 @xcite , and define the determinant function @xmath111~ ~ ~. \\label{detfunc}\\ ] ] this function is shown in fig .  5 for five different temperatures ( solid lines ) at a fixed pion chemical potential of @xmath112 .",
    "the intersection of these curves with zero ( horizontal dashes ) below @xmath113 ( the bound state domain ) gives the pole position .",
    "we see that a pole always occurs provided the temperature lies above some critical value @xmath114 , for which the pole is at threshold and ceases to exist .",
    "this @xmath115 is close to the lower critical temperature for the gap , @xmath43 , where the excitation spectrum vanishes at @xmath40 and quasiparticles begin to condense as singles .",
    "thus , the bound state and gap solution disappear at a similar critical temperature ; differences are ascribable to the fact that we use free quasiparticle energies in the @xmath7matrix.[point1 ]    there is a second special temperature @xmath116 , for which a pole exists at @xmath117 ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "it is identical to the upper critical temperature @xmath27 at which the gap vanishes , as may easily be seen by rewriting the @xmath7matrix for @xmath118 near @xmath119 , @xmath120 in the non  relativistic limit , @xmath121 follows as ( see appendix ) @xmath122 which is precisely the same condition as for @xmath27 , eq .",
    "( [ thou1 ] ) . the gap equation ( [ gapeqn ] ) thus reduces to the @xmath7matrix pole condition at the particular energy @xmath117 . in fermion systems",
    ", this is the well  known thouless criterion @xcite for the onset of a phase transition to a pair condensate .",
    "we note that the thouless criterion is only approximately valid if relativistic corrections are included .",
    "several observations can be made .",
    "firstly , one always obtains a pole in the @xmath7matrix if the temperature lies above @xmath123 .",
    "thus , at fixed @xmath20 , no matter how weak the interaction strength is ( provided it is attractive in the neighborhood of the @xmath10 threshold ) , one always obtains a pole for sufficiently high temperatures ( for fermions at a sufficiently low temperature ) . in practice , @xmath115 ( and @xmath116 ) will exceed sensible values for pions as soon as @xmath20 drops below @xmath124 , since they are increasing functions of @xmath20 . secondly , for a fixed interaction strength ,",
    "the pole position shifts downward with increasing temperature ( for fermions : pole position moves up with increasing temperature ) . as a function of temperature , we therefore see a behavior for bosons opposite to that for fermions .    the fact that increasing temperature reinforces the binding is somewhat counterintuitive , but is an immediate consequence of the coth  factor associated with bose statistics in eq .",
    "( [ a : tmat2 ] ) .",
    "indeed , one realizes that the coth ",
    "factor increases with increasing temperature and thus effectively enhances the two  body interaction .",
    "we can therefore always find a bound state for arbitrarily small attraction : it suffices to increase the temperature or , equivalently , the density accordingly .",
    "this is opposite to the fermion case where the corresponding tanh  factor suppresses the interaction with increasing temperature .",
    "therefore , in the fermion case , even at the @xmath7matrix level there exists a critical temperature where the cooper pole ceases to exist . for bosons , on the other hand ,",
    "once one has reached @xmath125 , a bound state ( here @xmath126 ) exists and the bound state energy simply continues to decrease as the temperature increases .",
    "of course , this becomes unphysical as soon as the density of pairs becomes so strong that the bound states start to obstruct each other , and finally dissolve at an upper critical temperature ( mott effect ) .",
    "precisely this non  linear effect is very efficiently taken care of in the gap equation . in spite of the fact that we still have a coth  factor in the gap equation",
    ", there is now a crucial difference : the argument of the coth ",
    "factor is the quasiparticle energy , eq .",
    "( [ ek ] ) , ( over @xmath7 ) and thus , due to the presence of @xmath127 in @xmath24 , the origin of the coth is shifted to the right with respect to the @xmath7matrix case .",
    "now , as @xmath7 increases , the only way to keep the equality of the gap equation is for @xmath128 to decrease  this pushes the origin of the coth back to the left , counterbalancing its increase due to the increasing temperature .",
    "of course , this only works until @xmath129 , _",
    "i.e. _ , until the temperature has reached @xmath27 .",
    "this is precisely the temperature @xmath116 for which the bound state in the @xmath7matrix reaches an energy @xmath130 .",
    "we therefore see that in spite of the fact that the bosons prefer high phase space density , the formation of bound states ceases to exist beyond a critical temperature  just as for fermions .",
    "lastly , we return to the behavior of the pole for varying total momentum @xmath110 , and the threshold effect seen in fig .  4 . since @xmath131 becomes complex above threshold , we show in fig .  6",
    "its magnitude for fixed @xmath103 and @xmath80 , and various values of @xmath110 .",
    "as expected , for increasing @xmath110 ( _ i.e. _ , decreasing phase space occupation felt by the two pions in question ) the pole ( zero of @xmath132 ) moves up in energy until it dissapears at some critical momentum @xmath133 . for @xmath134 ,",
    "the now non ",
    "zero minimum of the determinant function continues to shift to higher energies , corresponding roughly to the similar shift in the resonance peak in fig .",
    "in the previous section , we investigated the effect of a thermal medium on the pion dispersion relation at low momenta @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , one finds a critical temperature @xmath43 at which the pion dispersion relation is linear ( phonon - like ) in @xmath13 for small @xmath13 .",
    "this result is independent of the details of the interaction and characteristic of any bose system ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of @xmath135he ) .",
    "such a change in the pion dispersion relation at low temperatures would influence the pion spectra at low momentum . for this to occur ,",

    "of course , as remarked in ref .",
    "@xcite , the use of this procedure is rather tenuous since the system is by definition still far from freeze  out . in a dynamical calculation , hard collisions would re  thermalize the system at ever decreasing temperatures .    in fig .",
    "7 , the thermal transverse momentum spectrum for pions with @xmath80 and @xmath144 is shown with ( solid line ) and without ( dashes ) the effect of the gap energy .",
    "essentially , the presence of a large chemical potential gives the spectrum the appearance of one for small  mass particles , and the gap energy , which causes @xmath145 for long wavelengths , strengthens this effect .",
    "we would like to mention here again that the use of our force , eq .",
    "( [ 0pv ] ) , which respects chiral symmetry constraints @xcite , considerably reduces the effect of binding with respect to a purely phenomenological interaction , fitted to the phase shifts ( see , for example , ref .",
    "this stems from the fact that the expression ( [ 0pv ] ) becomes repulsive sufficiently below the @xmath113 threshold .",
    "this is not the case for commonly employed phenomenological forces @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the effect we see in fig .",
    "7 is relatively weak , but one should remember that the force ( [ 0pv ] ) is by no means a definitive expression . it is well known that in a many body system screening effects should be taken into account . whereas in a fermi system this tends to weaken the force , it is likely that screening strengthens it in bose systems . in this sense",
    "our investigation can only be considered schematic .",
    "a quantitative answer to the question of bound state formation in a hot pion gas is certainly very difficult to give .",
    "qualitatively , the curves in fig .  7 agree with the trend in the pion data at sps @xcite to be `` concave  up , '' but this is mainly an effect from the finite value of the chemical potential @xcite . while the gap changes the spectrum by a factor of @xmath146 at @xmath147 , this region is not part of detector acceptances .    in summary , we have shown that finite temperature induces real poles in the @xmath10 propagator below the @xmath113 threshold , even for situations where there is no @xmath10 bound state in free space @xcite .",
    "the situation is analogous to the cooper pole of fermion systems , and we therefore studied the corresponding bosonic `` gap '' equation .",

    "such a region always exists , even in the limit of infinitesimally weak attraction .",

    "the final aim will be to obtain an equation of state for a hot pion gas within a brckner ",
    "hartree  fock ",
    "bogoliubov approach .",
    "also , the subtle question of single boson versus pair condensation must be addressed ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , the fact that we obtain two pion bound states in a pionic environment leads to the speculation that higher clusters , such as four  pion bound states , _ etc .",
