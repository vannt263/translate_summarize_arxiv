    "the star forming regions in the constellation cygnus are among the most active regions of star birth in our galaxy .",
    "an overview of these regions is presented in reipurth & schneider ( 2008 ) .",
    "these authors emphasized the confusion of regions as near as hundreds of parsecs with regions at 12 kpc and even well beyond , due to the fact that in the direction of cygnus one looks down a spiral arm .",
    "kinematical distances suffer from the fact that the radial velocity gradient up to 4 kpc is smaller than the typical velocity dispersion of interstellar gas . as a consequence ,",
    "even the need for the nine classical subgroups ob1 to ob9 in cygnus is still discussed , with for example a suggestion that ob1 , ob8 and ob9 might just form one single subgroup ( melnik & efremov 1995 ) .",
    "hence , distances derived from young eclipsing binary systems are of value to localise the star forming regions and stellar associations .",
    "a major study of binary stars in cygnus has focused on cyg  ob2 , the most famous and probably youngest subgroup .",
    "the cyg  ob2 radial velocity survey encompasses now twenty - five massive binaries ( kobulnicky et al.2012 ; kiminki & kobulnicky 2012 ) .",
    "another very recent study ( mahy et al .  2013 ) focus on bright o  type stars .",
    "274 spectra taken over three years reveal four spectroscopic binaries ( three in cyg  ob1 and one in cyg  ob9 ; none in cyg  ob3 and cyg  ob8 ) .",
    "earlier studies discuss binary stars in open clusters superposed on cyg  ob1 .",
    "zakirov ( 1999 ) presents three eclipsing binaries with early  b primary components which are plausible members of the open cluster ic  4996 , but @xmath8 photometry without orbital - phase resolved spectroscopy did not lead to precise fundamental parameters .",
    "boeche et al .",
    "( 2004 ) detect nine binaries out of sixteen stars in the direction of ngc  6913 , including seven binary stars ( one eclipsing ) among the 12 presumed cluster members .",
    "they adopt a distance of 1.6  kpc to ngc  6913 , but emphasize ( their fig .",
    "2 ) that the cluster distance can not be well constrained . very recently ,",
    "60 eclipsing systems in the field of the cygnus ob7 star forming region were identified by wolk et al .",
    "( 2013 ) from @xmath9 photometry in 100 nights spanning 1.5 year",
    ". a minority of them ( 23 ) are detached systems with orbital periods between @xmath10 and just over 13 days , and a majority ( 37 ) show continuous flux variations with periods ranging from 0.2 to 3 days .",
    "most of the latter are thought to be w  uma contact binaries .",
    "these stars have @xmath11 band magnitudes from 12.5 to 17.3 , and are identified as diskless field stars .",
    "w  uma type contact binaries are not observed in clusters younger than about 1  gyr .",
    "we did not find any literature on later - type binary stars unequivocally identified as members of the young associations .",
    "the stars discussed in this paper are situated in the ob1ob3ob9 region .",
    "two of them are suspected to be pre - main sequence systems with a - type components , based on photometric studies ( zakirov & eshankulova 2005 ; 2006 ) .",
    "they suggest the stars are connected to cyg ob9 ( v443 cyg ) and to a group of ob - stars in the direction of cyg ob1 ( v456 cyg ) .",
    "nelson ( 2011 ) points out the lack of spectroscopic knowledge for v456 cyg and leaves open the question whether the primary component of this system is an early  a or a late  a star .",
    "the third object , v2107 cyg ( hd  191473 ) , is an early - b system at the end of or slightly off the main sequence with a primary component of luminosity class iii to iv ( b0.5iii , roman 1951 ; b0iv , morgan et al .",
    "1955 ; b1iii , walborn 1971 ) , and thus a particularly interesting age calibrator .",
    "their position in the cygnus region , relative to the stellar subgroups , is shown in fig .  1 .    in this paper , we summarize first the characteristics of the observations , and the analysis methodology applied (   2 & 3 ) .",
    "thereafter , each of the three binary systems is discussed in turn (   4 to 6 ) and the general conclusions are presented in   7 .",
    "for each object , spectra at 11 to 15 orbital phases were obtained , and the light curve was covered completely in thousands of ccd frames obtained from 2009 to 2011 using various broad - band filters .",
    "the journal of the observations is given in table  1 ( spectroscopy ) and table  2 ( photometry ) .",

    "2005 for technical details ) .",
    "the chelle spectrograph hermes ( raskin et al . , 2011 ) at the 1.2m mercator telescope was used in high - resolution mode ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "it covers the wavelength range from 3700 to 9000 angstrm in 55 chelle orders , with small gaps between the extreme - reddest orders .",
    "five to six consecutive exposures of 600 seconds keep the doppler shifts during a single exposure below 1 ( 2 ) kms@xmath23 for the primary ( secondary ) , respectively , and summed provide a signal - to - noise ratio near 150 over a broad range .",
    "the data reduction pipeline of the spectrograph was used with the calibration frames available in standard operation mode , complemented by personally written programmes in the esomidas package for continuum definition and removal of weaker cosmic rays by intercomparison of the subsequent exposures .",
    "photometry was performed at the ulupinar observatory of anakkale onsekiz mart university ( @xmath24",
    "n , @xmath25 e , altitude 410-m ) .",
    "the schmidt - cassegrain type telescopes and the alta back - illuminated ccd detectors ( apogee @xmath26 ) were used .",
    "bias and dark frame subtraction and flat field division was done using the iraf platform .",
    "the c - munipack software was used to perform aperture photometry with the size of the apertures three times the nightly fwhm values of the stellar images .",
    "initially , several comparison and check stars were measured and those giving the lowest standard deviations in their differential magnitudes were selected for final differential photometry .",
    "orbital periods are taken from the literature ( v443  cyg and v456  cyg ) or determined by combining our data with published measurements ( v2107  cyg ) in order to gain precision by exploiting much longer time baselines than covered by our own data alone . as a preliminary step",
    ", radial velocities were measured on the spectra for few individual lines , as far as line blending and component intensity allow .",
    "together with published radial velocities , they were used with the purpose to obtain initial orbital parameters for the fourier spectra disentangling code @xmath27 ( hadrava , 1995 ) and @xmath28 ( iliji , 2003 ; see also ) .",
    "these codes solve for the pure keplerian orbit , and deliver component spectra that are used to determine spectral types and , in particular , the temperature of the primary component .",
    "thereafter , the light curves of the eclipsing systems are modeled , using the phoebe lc package ( pra & zwitter , 2005 ) which uses the wilson - devinney code ( wilson & devinney , 1971 ) , inclusive the stellar atmosphere model ( kurucz , 1993 ) and a detailed reflection treatment ( wilson , 1990 ) .",
    "circular orbits represent well the data for v443  cyg and v456  cyg .",
    "the orbit of v2107  cyg is very slightly eccentric .",
    "the photometry puts a lower limit to @xmath29 and the spectroscopic solution must be tuned for consistency in the time of periastron passage (  6 ) .",
    "the mass ratio for the three systems was fixed to the value obtained from the spectroscopy .",
    "the light curve models used albedos @xmath30 and gravity darkening coefficients @xmath31 set to the generally adopted values ( rucinski , 1973 ; lucy , 1967 ) .",
    "two - dimensional logarithmic limb - darkening coefficients were interpolated from the values given by van hamme ( 1993 ) .",
    "the temperature of the primary components were set to the spectroscopically estimated values .",
    "semi - detached and detached configurations were tested .",
    "all three systems turn out to be well inside their roche lobes .",
    "the orbital period of v443  cyg is @xmath32 ( zakirov & eshankulova , 2005 ) .",
    "the spectra disentangling codes converge to solutions with mass ratio close to unity ( table 3 ) , both in the @xmath33 and the @xmath344400 regions .",
    "we used the jackknife method ( see e.g. bissell & ferguson 1975 ) to estimate the uncertainties and bias in the parameters , leaving out one spectrum at a time .",
    "it reveals that the size and orbital phase distribution of the present set of spectra is near the lower limit required for a robust orbital solution .",
    "for example , in the @xmath344400 region including h@xmath35 and mgii@xmath344481 , we have nine instead of eleven useful spectra ( the two additional ones being too noisy in the blue due to high airmass ) and the orbit solution is instable in the sense that leaving out one more spectrum may change the mass ratio by 15 per cent .",
    "thus , the precision of the orbit solution relies on the redder part of the spectrum .",
    "a significant gain in precision could be obtained by doubling the dataset .",
    "for example , allowing for ( unexplained ) subpixel shifts in two spectra that are least consistent with the whole set reduces the uncertainties by a factor of two .",
    "this gives an impression of the sensitivity of the present solution to data reduction or / and calibration issues ( or to the assumption of the doppler shifts reflecting a purely keplerian orbit ) .",
    "the orbit derived from the spectra disentangling is given in table  4 .",
    "the component spectra obtained in the two mentioned wavelength regions ( fig .",
    "2 ) indicate f - type components , in contrast to the expectation of zakirov & eshankulova ( 2005 ) whose photometric analysis pointed to young a  type stars .",
    "the brightest component of v443cyg is similar to hd128167 , while the faintest component is similar to hd38393 ; but , apparently , @xmath33 is partly filled - in with emission ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "hd128167 ( @xmath36 boo ) is a f2v star .",
    "most studies agreed on @xmath37 , @xmath38 and [ fe / h ] @xmath39 -0.4 dex ( edvardsson et al . 1993 ; gratton et al . 1996 ; cunha et al .",
    "2000 ; cenarro et al .",
    "2007 ) . in view of its spectral type f2/3v ,",
    "the effective temperature of the primary is fixed to 6700  k in the light - curve analysis .",
    "hd38393 is classified f6.5v ( gray et al .",
    "most studies agree on @xmath40 , @xmath38 and [ fe / h ] @xmath39 -0.1 dex ( edvardsson et al .",
    "1993 ; gray et al . 2006 ; cenarro et al . 2007 ) .",
    "hence , v443cyg contains an early - f and a mid / late - f star .",

    "7 shows the best - fitting lc models and table  5 the associated parameters .",
    "table  6 lists the characteristics of the components and the orbit , as derived from the combined spectroscopic - photometric analysis .",
    "the masses and radii are , within the substantial uncertainties , compatible with the spectral types .",
    "the system is significantly less massive than the @xmath41 mentioned by zakirov & eshankulova ( 2005 ) , and has a mass ratio much nearer to unity .",
    "component masses are of the order of 1.1 to 1.2 @xmath42 .",
    "the difference in spectral type and temperature is better compatible with a mass ratio around 0.9 ( that is within the error bars of the present analysis ) than with the best nominal value @xmath43/@xmath44  =  0.98 ( see fig .",
    "for such a light system still near the zero - age main sequence , the exact age is largely uncertain .",
    "isochrones derived from the tracks of bertelli et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , where initial rotation velocity for tracks and isochrones is not taken into account , show that the system might be either as young as 2@xmath45 years or more than one gy old .",
    "the system is at a distance of @xmath46  kpc .",
    "in accordance with nelson ( 2011 ) , we used an orbital period of @xmath47 .",
    "zakirov & eshankulova ( 2006 ) suggested a parabolic trend in the o ",
    "c diagram of v456  cyg .",
    "however , this assumption leads to less consistency between our light and rv data that were obtained at different epochs .",
    "moreover , we notice that the more recent orbital period published in hoffman et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , @xmath48 , based on the nsvs photometry ( wozniak , vestrand , akerlof et al .",
    "2004 ) , is an alias of the true period , @xmath49 .",
    "it is in disagreement with the extensive list of eclipse timings in the literature .",
    "this is also the case for several other stars in that paper .",
    "the rvs given by nelson ( 2011 ) , shifted by @xmath50  kms@xmath23 , were used together with ours to determine the initial parameters for the spectra disentangling codes .",
    "this shift was determined comparing for both data sets the linear relation between the rvs of both components , with the gradient giving the mass ratio @xmath51 ( identical for both sets ) and the zero - point defined by @xmath52 .",
    "while not stated explicitly in his paper , we suspect that the velocities of nelson , by the use of templates , are relative to the systemic velocity of the system rather than on an absolute velocity scale .",
    "the applied shift is estimated to be uncertain by 1.5  km / s .",
    "the orbit derived from the spectra disentangling is given in table  4 . when analysed separately , the nelson rvs give 5 percent lower velocity amplitudes .",
    "therefore , the formal uncertainties ( 1 percent ) on @xmath53 and @xmath54 should be interpreted with caution .",
    "uncertainties of 2.5 percent on the masses may be more realistic .",
    "the reconstructed component spectra of v456  cyg ( fig .",
    "3 ) definitely rule out ` model 1 ' of nelson ( 2011 ) .",
    "the hydrogen lines of the primary are consistent with late  a type stars , with @xmath33 suggesting a9 and h@xmath35 rather a7 .",
    "the balmer lines do not show the strongly stark broadened wings of early  a type stars , and the dynamical analysis does not leave space to consider higher luminosity . however , the ratios of @xmath344417 ( feii and tiii blend ) and tiii@xmath344444 to mgii@xmath344481 suggest a4 , and cai@xmath344227 and the caiik line ( the latter not disentangled , but when the secondary component is eclipsed ) suggest a2 .",
    "thus , one is tempted to classify v456  cyg  a as a slightly metal - weak star , a2ha7ma4 .",
    "its rotation velocity is @xmath55  kms@xmath23 . with the hydrogen lines being the most sensitive temperature parameter , the temperature of v456  cyg",
    "a is fixed at @xmath56k for the light curve analysis .",
    "+   +    the mgii@xmath344481 line is stronger than fei@xmath344383 , and the mgii line does not show a greater weakening than the general metallic - line spectrum with respect to the hydrogen lines . as both of these criteria are contrary to what is seen in _ most _ @xmath34 bootis stars ( see e.g. gray 1988 ) , the star very probably does not belong to this class . whether the hydrogen lines are in a subtle way peculiar , as seen in @xmath34 bootis type stars , is not easily evaluated on the reconstructed spectrum .",
    "the secondary component rotates significantly slower , but a precise estimate is hard at the tfosc resolution .",
    "we put an upper limit of 50 kms@xmath23 to @xmath57 .",
    "the star shows a general resemblance with the degraded high - resolution uves spectra of hd164259 , a f2iv star , although not perfectly .",
    "the noise level in the reconstructed spectrum of the fainter companion and the restricted resolution do not permit to confirm independently a slightly low metallicity as seen in the primary .",
    "the system certainly deserves a more detailed analysis at higher resolution . in conclusion ,",
    "the reconstructed spectra show a system consisting of a late  a and early  f spectrum , with at least the primary being somewhat metal - weak .",
    "7 shows the best - fitting lc models and table  5 the associated parameters .",
    "table  6 lists the characteristics of the components and the orbit , as derived from the combined spectroscopic - photometric analysis .",
    "our solution is near to nelson s ( 2011 ) ` model 2 ' , but in some aspects different .",
    "nelson s problem of disparate ages related to the radius of the less massive star and its @xmath58 being larger than for the primary does not survive in our solution ( @xmath59 ; @xmath60 ) .",
    "we find also masses 8% higher ( while agreeing on the mass ratio ) , and the luminosity of the primary exceeds nelson s by 30% .",
    "the system is at a distance of @xmath61  kpc .    with the precision obtained for this system ,",
    "a discussion of its position in the hertzsprung - russell diagram is interesting .",
    "the stars are slightly too cool and too small for their masses , unless a metallicity as high as @xmath62 is assumed .",
    "the least we can state is that the photosphere does not provide arguments for an enhanced metallicity .",
    "therefore , it appears worthwhile to investigate the option that the system might be young , near to but still on its way to the main - sequence . a comparison with the tracks of bertelli et al .",
    "( 2009 ) shows an encouraging agreement ( see fig .  8) , although the less massive component is predicted further from the main - sequence than observed . in order to discern",
    "whether the system is arriving at the zero age main sequence ( 25 myr ) , or older ( 315 myr ) with higher metallicity , more detailed spectroscopy is required .",
    "any age between the quoted extremes is presently still an option .",
    "phasing our photometry together with the hipparcos satellite photometry , the orbital period was fixed to @xmath63 .",
    "an earlier spectroscopic study ( mercier 1957 , further m57 ) suggested an orbit with small eccentricity ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "lucy & sweeney ( 1971 ) , further ls71 , in a paper rejecting low - eccentricity orbits for many systems after considering the bias in the determination of @xmath65 ( towards larger @xmath65 for low @xmath65 ) , confirmed that the orbit of v2107  cyg is probably not circular ( @xmath66 ) and updated the orbital parameters , inclusive @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , a discussion of the reality of a non - circular orbit despite the 4day period is presented in   6.2 .",
    "since the secondary star is occulted completely during six hours around phase 0.5 , the spectrum of the hotter component ( a ) is observed directly .",
    "the spectrum of the secondary is not readily visible in any of the observed spectra , even after ( scaled ) subtraction of the observed pure component  a spectrum .",
    "the light curve suggests a contribution of the secondary to the total light of only 6 per cent .",
    "hence , a large range of @xmath54 must be explored in the spectral disentangling . a further complication in identifying the signal of the secondary is posed by the line profile variability in the primary .",
    "hence , we discuss in subsequent subsections first the spectrum of v2107cyg  a and the character and cause of the variable metal line profiles .",
    "then , we evaluate the need for a non - circular orbit . and finally , the orbit and the fundamental parameters of the stars are presented .      the spectrum of the hotter component ( a ) is observed directly near phase 0.5 . comparison with pure rotation profiles ( gray , 1992 , @xmath68 ) for ten sufficiently unblended metal lines between 4260 and 5740 angstrm , mainly due to siiii and oii , suggests an apparent rotation velocity of @xmath69 kms@xmath23 . this value should be interpreted as an upper limit to @xmath57 as other velocity fields ( macroturbulence , pulsations , etc . )",
    "were not considered . a comparison of hydrogen and helium lines with model calculations ( lte line - blanketed models with depth dependent non - lte line formation computations , as described in vrancken et al . , 1997 )",
    ", fixing @xmath70 cgs as derived from the analysis of the binary , suggests @xmath71  k. the uncertainty takes into account that better models are required as lines or line cores formed in higher photospheric layers are inadequately represented ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "such detailed analysis is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "most metal lines show asymmetric line cores .",

    "the check was performed on the highest - quality data , with estimated rms uncertainties of 0.005 to 0.008 mag .",

    "data in ingress and egress of eclipses were avoided .",
    "the photometric data are suggestive of short - term light variability , either multi - periodic or irregular .",
    "a period search did not single out any dominant frequency , although several peaks ( many of them aliases of each other ) are above the noise level .",
    "test computations with artificial data and combinations of two frequencies with peaks in the observed power diagram indicate that the noise level and the observed time windows may be insufficient to retrieve the true frequencies uniquely .",

    "the uncertainties mentioned in our solution are computed with the formalism developed in ls71 . in view of the evidence for non - radial pulsations that would influence the line position measurements in a non - random way",
    ", we used also the jackknife method to estimate bias in the orbital parameters and uncertainties .",
    "the bias does not exceed the 1-@xmath36 level , but , more importantly , the jackknife method suggests larger uncertainties , by a factor of about 2 , for @xmath76 and @xmath65 .",
    "adopting these uncertainties suggest not to reject a circular orbit ( if we use the ls71 criterion @xmath84 ) .",
    "hence , the m57 data may not be sufficient to reject a circular orbit .",
    "using our set of spectroscopic data does not lead to a stronger conclusion .",
    "however , the light curve provides a completely new piece of evidence . fitting a circular orbit leaves in ingress and egress of the secondary eclipse systematic residuals that can be removed for a phase separation between the eclipses that is slightly different from half a period , in the sense that",
    "the secondary eclipses seen in the @xmath85 data occur slightly earlier than half a period after primary eclipse , requiring @xmath86 .",
    "notice that the hipparcos data indicate an opposite effect , if any .",
    "however , these data are less straightforward to interprete , both because the eclipses are sparsely covered ( from observations in different orbital cycles ) , and because a significant part of the data in eclipse tends to have larger than average uncertainty estimates in the hipparcos catalogue .",
    "taken at face value , a varying time separation between the eclipses might indicate motion of the line of apsides .",
    "therefore , we searched for solutions that would represent as well our photometric data , as the hipparcos ones , and the mercier spectroscopy .",
    "the search was made for @xmath87 taking into account that @xmath88 may change with time . towards the larger eccentricities in this interval ,",
    "the @xmath88 value at the time of the recent photometry is nearer to ( as compared with the m57 epoch ) but larger than 90 degrees .",
    "however , we were unable to constrain the eccentricity in this way , as the hipparcos photometry requires @xmath88 somewhat below 90 degrees , but not that much that almost one full apsidal motion period would have elapsed from m57 to the present time .",
    "higher - precision data are needed to pinpoint the small eccentricity . from the available data we conclude @xmath89 . in order to show the need for a non - circular orbit , fig .",
    "7 , lower panel , shows the solution for @xmath64 and @xmath90 , as well as for a circular orbit .    using the @xmath33 region of our spectroscopy",
    ", we do not find support for combinations ( @xmath65 , @xmath88 ) as derived from photometry for @xmath91 , in the sense that such combinations do not lead to solutions with lower chi - square than with a circular orbit .",
    "however , in view of the restricted number of spectra and their phase distribution we prefer not to use this argument to exclude firmly slightly higher eccentricity .",
    "fortunately , @xmath53 depends on the assumed value @xmath65 only at the @xmath92  kms@xmath23 level .",
    "the value of @xmath53 is consistent with radial velocity measurements obtained directly from specific lines ( but this classical method leads to larger uncertainty in @xmath53 ) .",
    "the dependency of @xmath54 on @xmath65 is negligible in view of the much larger uncertainty associated with the fact that the signature of the doppler movement of the faint secondary component is detected only marginally .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of the @xmath93 spectroscopy is insufficient to reconstruct any specific feature in the spectrum of the secondary .",
    "only the integrated doppler signal is detected . in view of the marginal detection",
    ", an effort was made to map the multi - dimensional chi - square space in the neighbourhood of the deepest minima , for a circular orbit ( fig .",
    "test computations for slightly eccentric orbits shows that details of the geometry in chi - square space change with @xmath65 , but not the global structure .",
    "the detailed gridding reveals the existence of various chi - square minima similar in depth for @xmath94  kms@xmath23 , while @xmath53 and the phase of maximum velocity are well - determined .",
    "we constructed the grid up to far outside of this @xmath54 range , for @xmath95 , but found no similar minima outside the range quoted above .",
    "the most prominent minima are suspiciously narrow , in view of the width of the core of the @xmath33 line , and possibly linked to structure in the noise or in the spectra ( telluric lines , pulsation ? ) .",
    "therefore , the right - hand side panel of fig .",
    "8 presents a smoothed version of the chi - square space .",
    "the uncertainty quoted for the final spectroscopic orbit ( table 4 ) and the fundamental parameters of the components ( table 6 ) take into account the location of the multiple minima , rather than selecting quite arbitrary one of the narrow minima .",

    "<S> the age of both systems , on or very near to the main sequence , remains uncertain by an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> v2107  cyg is a more massive system ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) at @xmath5  kpc and , also kinematically , a strong candidate - member of cygob1 . </S>",
    "<S> the more massive component is slightly evolved and appears to undergo non - radial @xmath6type pulsations . </S>",
    "<S> the doppler signal of the secondary is barely detectable . </S>",
    "<S> a more extensive study is important to fix masses more precisely , and an asteroseismological study would then become appropriate . nevertheless , the position of the primary in the hr - diagram confines the age already reasonably well to @xmath7  myr , indicating for cygob1 a similar extent of star formation history as established for cygob2 . </S>"
