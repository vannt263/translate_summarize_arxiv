    "practically all late - type galaxies share one common property : an approximately exponential stellar surface density profile @xcite which extends over several scale lengths . as observations reached fainter surface brightness limits , a more diverse picture of late - type morphologies has become apparent : a major portion of such galaxies actually exhibit broken exponential profiles @xcite .",
    "first , truncated or down - bending discs were discovered @xcite .",
    "these discs profiles feature a break at a radius outside of which the surface brightness profile is still exponential steeper . by contrast , @xcite observed anti - truncated or up - bending profiles in barred s0-sb galaxies .",
    "the breaks in these galaxies have the opposite behaviour : the slope of the exponential profile outside of the break is shallower than its inner counterpart .",
    "thus stellar disc profiles fall into three different categories :    type - i : :    pure exponential profiles type - ii : :    truncated or down - bending profiles type - iii : :    anti - truncated or up - bending profiles    several studies investigated the abundance of each type of disc breaks in different observational samples @xcite with the result that the relative abundances vary with morphological type .",
    "@xcite found that pure exponential ( type - i ) discs are rather rare ( 10 % ) .",
    "@xcite find that more than 70% of the galaxies with broken discs have a bar .",
    "they claim that the origin of anti - truncated discs in particular is related to bars . another possible cause for anti - truncated profiles , dubbed _ disc fading _ , are stellar halos which outshine the stellar disc at large radii , although @xcite found that this can only explain a minor fraction of observed type - iii light profiles .",
    "the formation of type - ii discs has been studied in many numerical models of isolated galaxies @xcite .",
    "the size of the inner disc , the radial position of the disc break , is related to an upper limit of gas angular momentum in a rotationally supported star forming gaseous disc @xcite . in this picture , stars that populate the regions outside the break radius must have been born inside the break .",
    "@xcite proved that radial migration induced by transient spiral arms can move a sufficient number of stars outside the break radius .",
    "an important diagnostic of this mechanism is that the migrated stars stay on circular orbits .",
    "this mechanism predicts positive stellar age gradients outside the break in truncated discs @xcite .",
    "the existence of such breaks has been confirmed by spectroscopic observations of ngc 6155 @xcite .",
    "recent work by @xcite found that positive age gradients in galaxy outskirts are not unique to type - ii discs .",
    "they claim that these age profiles are not linked to truncations in the light profiles but do not rule out stellar migration as their formation mechanism .",
    "the origin of type - iii breaks is still poorly understood .",
    "most of the proposed mechanisms resort to external forces @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite found no dependence of a galaxy s disk break type on its environment .",
    "this disfavours an external origin of breaks in stellar disks .",
    "the first successful attempt to produce anti - truncated discs in simulations of isolated galaxies was put forward in a preceding letter ( * ? ? ?",

    "in paper i we found that the type of the profile break correlates with initial host halo spin by analysing a set of controlled simulations of isolated galaxies .",
    "low - spin halos produce anti - truncated stellar discs , high - spin halos yield truncated discs . in a sharp transition between these two regimes ( intermediate spin ) pure exponential profiles formed ( see section [ sec : results ] for more details ) . in the present paper we present results of a more thorough analysis of the low - spin simulations that were the subject of paper i , the simulations that formed anti - truncated stellar discs .",

    "we seek a more analytic understanding of how anti - truncated discs may form . in section [ sec : simulations ] we quickly review the simulations from paper i. the simulations with the lowest spin will be analysed in more detail and with a particular focus on stellar orbit evolution and bar properties in section [ sec : results ] .",

    "an important signature of this mechanism is that the migrated stars in the outer disc are predominantly on circular orbits , rotationally supported .",

    "second , the mass of stars ending up outside the break region ( the area under each histogram ) increases as @xmath0 decreases . ]",
    "given the substantial radial mass redistribution in anti - truncated discs , we are now going to explore what mechanism is most important in driving this redistribution .",

    "[ fig : star_orbit ] presents the evolution of orbital parameters of a sample star particle from the outer disc ( thus a particle on an eccentric orbit ) .",

    "the times of pericentric passage are marked by vertical dashed lines .",
    "the star gains or loses energy ( second panel ) and angular momentum ( third panel ) each time it passes through its pericentre .",
    "as it moves away from pericentre , its energy stays constant , but it loses angular momentum , which reduces the circularity of the star ( bottom panel ) .    the binding energy evolves approximately following a step function .",
    "the steps occur when the star is at pericentre . if the star gains energy @xmath3 at pericentre its semi - major axis increases and vice versa .",
    "the pericentre , however , stays more or less constant at approximately 2 kpc .",
    "this particular star has a net gain in energy which is not surprising as it has been selected from the outer disc in the final simulation output . in general it",
    "is also possible for a star to have a net loss of energy .",
    "such stars migrate towards the galaxy centre and , therefore , can not be found in the outer disc .    before 4.5 gyr ,",
    "the star in fig .",
    "[ fig : star_orbit ] has a rather small semi - major axis ( @xmath37 ) and the evolution of its binding energy does not follow a step function but behaves rather arbitrarily .",
    "this indicates that the binding energy of the star is constant when it is far away from the centre but varies when it is in the centre .",
    "thus , we expect the source of the variation of binding energy to be in the centre of the galaxy .",
    "as we will show later ( sections [ sec : bar_star ] and [ sec : toy_model ] ) the source is the central bar .",
    "-component of specific angular momentum .",
    "while the star s apocentre is still small ( @xmath38 ) its binding energy is almost permanently changing .",
    "after approximately 4.5 gyr its apocentre growths significantly and the star s binding energy turns into a step function with steps occurring only at pericentres .",
    "the star particle instantaneously gains energy and angular momentum during many pericentre passages . in between these passages",
    "its energy stays constant but it looses angular momentum which causes the particles circularity to decrease steadily . ]      since particle orbits seem most affected in the centre of galaxies near a possible bar , we characterize the bar using @xmath39 fourier modes of the galaxy centre : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are mass and azimuth angle of the stars .",
    "the sum is over all stars in the considered region of the galaxy .",

    "[ fig : bar_strength ] we present the time evolution of the relative @xmath39 amplitude @xmath45 in the innermost kpc for a selection of simulations .",
    "the lowest spin simulations ( the ones with anti - truncated discs ) have a bar strength that exceeds that of all other simulations for a continuous period of 4 or more gyr .",
    "this is another indication linking a bar to the formation of an anti - truncated disc .",
    "fourier mode of all stellar particles inside 1 kpc as a function of time .",
    "while the values for intermediate and high spin are rather low , there is an excess in bar strength for the lowest spin ( @xmath46 ) simulations for a period of about 4 gyr . ]",
    "[ fig : bar_profile_ev ] shows the relative bar strength in different radial bins at different output times for the @xmath16 galaxy .",

    "it ends at @xmath47 , so it makes sense to look for possible effects on star particles inside that region .",
    "mode in radial bins of the stars in the simulation at different times .",
    "we see that the bar forms after 2 - 3 gyr ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : bar_strength ] ) and that it extends out to just outside 2 kpc . ]",
    "the pattern speed of the bar is the time derivative of the bar s position angle .",
    "[ fig : pattern_speed ] presents the pattern speed of the low spin ( @xmath16 ) simulation as a function of time .",
    "once the bar formed its pattern speed is remarkably constant .",
    "the constancy of the pattern speed will be important when we discuss the interaction of stellar particles and the bar in section [ sec : bar_star ] .",

    "the bottom left panel is a lindblad diagram .",
    "the dashed line in this diagram indicates a slope of p.    in the top panels of the figure we see that the star and the bar have the same sense of rotation and that the azimuthal phase of the star lags behind that of the bar . during the period that is shown in these images , the star gains a significant amount of binding energy @xmath3 ( bottom right panel ) .",
    "the slope of the star s trajectory in the lindblad diagram ( bottom left panel ) is remarkably similar to p , particularly for @xmath49 which is the time period in which the time evolution of binding energy @xmath3 is the strongest .",
    "this is a strong hint that the bar is dominating this gain in binding energy since the work by @xcite predicts such a behaviour in a rotating potential ( see also section [ sec : lindblad ] ) .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : vel_diff_bar_kick ] we compare the actual velocity of the star particle to that which it would have , if its binding energy would stay constant during the interaction with the bar .",
    "the vertical lines mark the times of the snapshots in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bar_star ] .",
    "we see that the velocities start to differ just inside the range marked by the vertical lines , during the interaction of the star with the bar , an before the star reaches its pericentre ( velocity maximum ) .",
    "the difference still increases after pericentre .    as the top panel of figure [ fig : bar_star ] shows the star and the bar share their sense of rotation and the star s azimuthal phase angle lags behind that of the bar ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "thus the tip of the bar is moving away from the star s trajectory . in a reference frame",
    "that is corotating with the bar this introduces an extra force @xmath51 that drives the star away from the bar and thus in the direction of a positive potential gradient ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the star is gaining potential energy that is not due to its acceleration by the galaxy s potential , the star is ` _ _ surfing in the bar s potential _ _ ' . in section [ sec : phase_dependence ]",
    "we will illustrate that this mechanism depends strongly on the relative phase of the star and the bar .     during the same time period ( solid line ) .",
    "it is compared to the hypothetical velocity the star particle would have if its binding energy @xmath53 was held constant at the value it had just before the interaction with the bar ( dashed line ) .",
    "the vertical lines indicate the times of the snapshots in the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : bar_star ] and thus mark the time span of the interaction of the star with the bar . ]",
    "so far we investigated the behaviour of a single star .",
    "however , finding a mechanism that drives a single star s migration out into the outer disc does not explain the existence of the outer disc . in order to show that the behaviour of that star is typical we use the signature of the bar : a slope of p in the lindblad diagram .",
    "[ fig : lindblad_evolution ] shows the trajectories in the lindblad diagram during the period of 4 - 5 gyr for eight randomly selected stars from the outer disc .",
    "we see that stellar trajectories with slope p in the lindblad diagrams are typical .",
    "the bar pattern speed p is constant ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pattern_speed ] ) and thus , any interaction with the bar should drive the trajectories in the lindblad diagram along a common slope of p. remarkably , any significant change in orbital energy of all the stars occurred with the same slope of @xmath54 .",
    "this immediately implies that the bar is indeed the driving mechanism to have migrated the stars that are in the outer disc . at the same time",
    ", there is also some change in angular momentum at constant orbital energy which we assume to take place away from pericentre passage ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : star_orbit ] ) .",
    "simulation that reside outside the break region in the final snapshot .",
    "the time span shown is @xmath55 .",
    "the squares and circles indicate the stars location at 4 and 5 gyr respectively .",
    "the thick black dashed line indicates a slope of p. the dashed and solid grey lines represent the locus of corotatiing orbits at @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "the region below those lines is inaccessible .",
    "it is striking that every change in orbital energy occurs parallel to p indicating that the bar is driving the energy gain of these stellar particles . ]",
    "in order to prove that the mechanism we proposed in section [ sec : bar_star ] , is capable of driving a growth of stellar orbit s semi - major axes , we created a very simple toy model . in this model",
    "the potential of the galaxy and its bar is analytic and time dependent .",
    "we chose an nfw @xcite potential with a minimum comparable to that of the low spin simulations .",
    "on top of this potential we introduce a rotating non - axisymmetric perturbation which mimics the effects of a rotating bar on the dynamics of test particles in this scenario .",
    "in such a model it is much easier to disentangle the influence of the bar s potential on a test particle from that of the total potential since we know its analytic expression .",
    "as this model is computationally extremely cheap , it allows us to study the problem at arbitrarily high time resolution .",
    "it gives us more control over the relative position of the test particle to the perturbing potential and thus allows us to understand the role of the relative azimuthal phase which we found to be important earlier .      in this model , a test particle moves in a nfw potential @xmath58 with a rotating non - axisymmetric gaussian perturbation @xmath59 \\label{eq : pot_pert}\\ ] ] in the centre , where @xmath60 in the above equations @xmath61 is the minimum unperturbed potential , @xmath62 the scale radius of the nfw potential , @xmath63 the relative strength of the perturbation , @xmath64 the extent of the perturbation in @xmath65 and @xmath66 direction ] , @xmath67 the rotation matrix for rotation by an angle @xmath68 , @xmath69 the perturbation s pattern speed and @xmath70 the initial phase of the perturbation s position angle .",
    "the total potential then is @xmath71 this yields a static nfw potential superimposed with a 2d - gaussian perturbation that is rotating with an angular speed of @xmath69 in the positive sense of rotation .      in this section",
    "we describe technical details of our toy model that are necessary for reproducing the results .",
    "the reader that is only interested in the results should bear in mind that the test particle in our model is initially already on an eccentric orbit with a moderate semi - major axis and may continue reading in section [ sec : toy_model_results ] .    for the following example we chose the following parameters : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "we investigated the trajectory of a particle in such a potential with these initial phase space coordinates : @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath77 .",
    "we evolved the test particle s coordinates with a leap - frog integration scheme for @xmath81 .",
    "we restricted the treatment to the @xmath82 plane for simplicity .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : toy_model_rad_e ] we show the evolution of the test particle s radial position ( black ) and its binding energy ( orange ) .",
    "the test particle experiences significant evolution in its semi - major axis ( maxima of the black line ) and its binding energy ( orange line ) .",
    "the growth of the semi - major axis during a single orbit can be as large as 1 kpc in this example .",
    "generally even larger growths are possible .",
    "the changes in binding energy occur at small radii , when the particle is affected by the rotating potential perturbation ( equations and ) . at larger",
    "radii the particle s binding energy is constant .",
    "consequently the evolution of the binding energy is similar to a step - function which is slightly smoothed .",
    "overall the evolution ( radius and binding energy ) of the test particle in the rotating potential is very similar to the evolution of the sample particle from the simulation which we presented in the two top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : star_orbit ] .",

    "]    in the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : perturbation_trajectory ] the trajectory of the test particle ( orange ) in the potential perturbation ( grey - scale ) is shown at the pericentre which is highlighted by the shaded area in fig .",
    "[ fig : toy_model_rad_e ] . in the bottom panel we plotted the evolution the amount of the particle s potential energy that is due to the perturbation ( black @xmath83 ) and the particle s binding energy @xmath3 ( orange ) relative to it s value before the encounter with the perturbation .",
    "the plot shows the time span that is shaded in fig .",
    "[ fig : toy_model_rad_e ] .",
    "we see that the particle s binding energy changes as soon as it starts to ` fall ' into the potential perturbation and stops changing when the particle leaves the perturbation .",
    "based on fig .",
    "[ fig : perturbation_trajectory ] we can spot three different independent effects :    1 .   in the bottom panel",
    "one can see that the particle spends more time on the falling edge than on the rising edge of its potential evolution indicating that the particle is being accelerated for a longer time than it is decelerated .",
    "however , this effect is not necessarily due to rotation of the perturbation but can in principle also occur in non - axisymmetric potentials that do not rotate .",
    "2 .   while the particle is approaching the centre , it is moving more or less parallel to the perturbation s minor axis ( top left panels ) .",
    "as the system evolves , the perturbation rotates and thus the particle s trajectory gradually aligns with the perturbation s major axis .",
    "consequently the particle feels a stronger acceleration as it is falling into the potential perturbation compared to its deceleration when it climbs out of the perturbation because the slope of the potential is locally steepest parallel to the perturbation s minor axis .",
    "combined with the first effect the particle experiences stronger acceleration for a longer time and weaker deceleration for a shorter time yielding a gain in binding energy .",
    "probably the cause of the former two effects is the fact that the azimuthal phase of the test particle lags behind that of the perturbation during the entire encounter .",
    "this is evident in the top panels . figuratively speaking",
    "this means that the potential well of the perturbation is trying to keep up with the test particle as the particle is falling into the potential well .",
    "this is an analogous behaviour to that of a surfer who is riding down a wave , constantly being accelerated by gravity without actually losing a lot of potential energy as the wave is moving along with the surfer .",
    "when the particle is climbing out of the potential well , the moving perturbation is pushing it up the potential well .",
    "this is again analogous to a surfer who is doing a bottom turn to try to regain height riding up the wave . in this case",
    "the surfer gains potential energy without losing much of his kinetic energy .",
    "we emphasize that the situation in fig .",
    "[ fig : perturbation_trajectory ] is very similar to that of the star from the simulation which is presented in fig . [ fig : bar_star ] .",
    "we note that the top panels show the stellar surface density in fig .",
    "[ fig : bar_star ] but the potential in fig .",
    "[ fig : perturbation_trajectory ] .",
    "however , the surface density serves as a fair proxy for the potential as both quantities are linked through poisson s equation . in both cases the azimuthal phase of the particle lags that of the bar or the perturbation respectively .",
    "if it was ahead of the bar , the opposite effect would occur : the particle would lose binding energy as the particle would try to ride the receding wing of the potential well . in the analogy with the surfer this would correspond to a surfer who is trying to catch up with the wave .",
    "of course this is bound to fail as the deceleration of gravity would increase the gap between the surfer and the wave .",
    "so far we have only shown a case in which a star predominantly gains energy as it interacts with a central perturbation .",
    "this scenario ( in particular the initial azimuthal phase of the perturbation ) has been constructed to yield a gain in energy . in order to understand whether this mechanism is capable of driving a substantial amount of mass to large radii",
    "it is important to determine how common such a scenario is .",
    "we evolved a system with different initial azimuthal phases of the perturbation but otherwise identical initial conditions .",
    "for the single orbit we chose the initial conditions described in section [ sec : toy_model_parameters ] . for integrating over many orbits , we chose the initial conditions to be a test particle on a circular orbit at @xmath84 ( that corresponds to a tangential velocity of @xmath85 ) .    the dependence of the change in binding energy is shown in fig .",

    "after a single orbit there is a well defined but rather strong dependence on the initial phase difference ( left panel ) .",
    "after many orbits the dependence is chaotic ( right panel ) .",
    "this is not very surprising given that there is a strong dependence on the initial phase for a single orbit already and that non - circular orbits are generally not closed . in terms of the surfing analogy , unlike a surfer , that test particle has no control on having the correct phase relative to the next wave because its orbit is governed by the potential it feels .",
    "thus , it is rather arbitrary whether it will be accelerated or decelerated during its next encounter with the central perturbation .",
    "therefore , the phase dependence is expected to become chaotic after only a few orbits .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_dependence ] also shows that quite a significant fraction of the integrated particles gain a large amount of binding energy ( @xmath86 ) . under the assumption",
    "that the azimuthal phases of stars in a galactic disc are evenly distributed , this demonstrates the capability of the bar to drive a significant number of stars to large radii that potentially comprise the outskirts of an anti - truncated stellar disc .",
    "in this section we will give some observational signatures of the anti - truncated discs which have formed in our simulations , by the mechanism that we described above .",
    "[ fig : disk_flatness ] shows the mean volume density in bins in the @xmath87 plane for a low and a high spin galaxy at 8 gyr . in the figure",
    "we see , that both galaxies are indeed in a disc - like configuration .",
    "the high spin galaxy has a slightly more boxy shape as the isodensity contours show .",
    "plane of the lowest spin galaxy ( @xmath16 , upper panel ) and a high spin galaxy ( @xmath28 , lower panel ) at 8 gyr .",
    "the cyan lines represent log - spaced isodensity contours .",
    "the dashed white line indicates the position of the break in the surface density profile .",
    "note that the x- and y - axis are scaled identically such that the aspect ratio is non - distorted .",
    "the figure shows that the stars in the low spin simulation are in a disc - like configuration , even in the outer disc , as their radial extent exceeds their vertical extent .",
    "note that the configuration in the low spin case is less boxy than in the high spin case . ]",
    "we have shown that the eccentricity distribution of the outer discs in truncated and anti - truncated discs is significantly different ( section [ sec : outer_discs ] ) .",
    "this leads to distinct dynamical properties of the discs that can be observed . in this section",
    "we will compare the disc dynamics of a simulated anti - truncated disc ( low - spin , @xmath16 ) and a truncated disc ( high - spin , @xmath28 ) .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rotcurves ] shows the mean tangential velocity profile @xmath88 of the stellar discs ( dashed lines ) for the @xmath16 and @xmath28 galaxies .",
    "they are compared to the expected tangential velocities for circular orbits ( solid lines ) .",
    "as the stellar discs host stars on non - circular orbits , we expect the mean tangential velocity to be smaller than the circular velocity in the respective galaxies as stars at apocentre have low velocities .",
    "however , the effect is much stronger for the @xmath16 galaxy which exhibits a discrepancy by a factor of 4 in the entire outer disc . for the @xmath28 galaxy ,",
    "the mean tangential velocity is only off by a factor of up to 2 .",
    "this trend of decreasing tangential velocities in the outer discs with decreasing @xmath0 is expected as the distribution of circularity parameters shift towards more eccentric orbits for low @xmath0 .",
    "the difference between the tangential velocity profile and the circular velocity curve is difficult to observe , as the circular velocity curve can not be observed easily .",
    "a better diagnostic for both types of discs ( truncated or anti - truncated ) is the velocity dispersion profile as these can be observed .",
    "the velocity dispersion profiles in each direction are presented in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rotcurves ] . the radial , tangential and vertical velocity dispersion",
    "are shown as the solid , dashed and dotted lines respectively .",
    "the prominent difference between both simulations is that the radial velocity dispersion in the @xmath16 ( anti - truncated ) disc is much higher than the tangential and vertical component . this is a signature of the large amount of eccentric orbits in these discs which cause large radial velocities in random directions at all radii . in the truncated disc ,",
    "all velocity dispersion components are comparable as it hosts a much smaller number of stars on eccentric orbits .",
    "the different dispersion profiles can in principle be measured .",
    "we will discuss the observational feasibility in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we have presented a thorough analysis of stellar orbit evolution in the simulated anti - truncated discs of paper i. the goal was to identify a mechanism that produces anti - truncated stellar discs via secular evolution .",
    "we chose a simple simulation set - up of disc formation within non - cosmological isolated halos to have full control over the halo spin and to facilitate the identification of secular , internal , mechanisms .",
    "we showed that the stars that make up the outer parts of anti - truncated discs were born on circular orbits well inside the final break radius ( * ? ? ? * fig .",
    "[ fig : rxy_hist ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the stars in the outer parts of anti - truncated discs have very eccentric orbits .",
    "therefore , the mechanism that produces anti - truncations can not be classical radial migration which plays a key role in the formation of truncated discs @xcite . instead , there has to be a mechanism that is able to drive stars to larger radii and that can turn those stars orbits from circular to eccentric .",
    "we find that the increase of orbital radii ( or more accurately their semi - major axes ) is driven by an increase in orbital energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : star_orbit ] ) which , in turn , is driven by encounters of the stars with the bar potential at their pericentres ( fig . [",
    "fig : bar_star ] and [ fig : lindblad_evolution ] ) .",
    "generally , stars can gain or lose energy when they interact with the rotating potential of a central bar .",
    "stars that gain energy have to have an azimuthal phase that is slightly lagging behind that of the bar .",
    "in that case the test particle can surf in the rotating potential well of the bar which causes the particle to have a positive net acceleration after the encounter .",
    "if the particle s phase is ahead of the bar s phase , the opposite happens : the particle experiences a net deceleration .    as of now the literature only provided models that associate environmental effects with the formation of anti - truncations .",
    "as this work presents a mechanism that is capable of producing these discs in simulations of isolated galaxies , we show that galaxies can form anti - truncated discs purely via secular evolution .",
    "this does not preclude that external forces @xcite play a role .",
    "the simulation set - up was deliberately designed to be simplistic , at the cost of being less realistic .",
    "we find that the initial halo spin matters as it sets the density with which stars form , and therefore the strength and longevity of any bar at centre .",
    "this effect can not be explored in simulations with prepared discs @xcite . for high spin parameters",
    "the gaseous disc is very extended but the gas surface density is comparatively low .",
    "this leads to more extended star formation at a rather low rate . in low spin halos",
    "the opposite happens .",
    "due to the large amount of low angular momentum gas a large portion of this gas is able to settle at low radii forming a concentrated massive gas disc with a high star formation rate . in this case",
    "a massive and concentrated disc forms which is highly susceptible to disc instabilities and thus very prone to bar formation .",
    "since the stellar mass density in the centre is very large , the bar is also very massive . as we had shown in this work",
    ", this massive bar is driving the formation of anti - truncated stellar discs .",
    "the eccentric orbits of the stars that comprise the outskirts of anti - truncated discs give rise to very unusual properties of a stellar disc : while being flat the outer disc rotates very slowly and its velocity dispersion is dominated by the radial component .    in principle",
    "these kinematic signatures provide a possible observational test for our model . however , the outskirts of such anti - truncated discs are very faint ( @xmath89 ) and thus not observable via techniques like integral field spectroscopy . a possible way to measure the kinematics of the outskirts of such discs would be to observe planetary nebulae .",
    "planetary nebulae have been used previously to measure velocity dispersions of galaxies at very low surface brightness @xcite and , thus , would provide a possible tool to observe an excess of radial velocity dispersion , the smoking gun of stars surfing in the bar s potential .",
