    "new and high quality data on galaxies belonging to nearby groups have improved considerably estimates of masses and mass - to - light ratios ( m / l ) of these systems .",
    "searches on the poss ii and eso / serc plates ( karachentseva & karachentsev 1998 ; 2000 ) as well as  blind \" hi surveys ( kilborn et al .",
    "2002 ) lead to the discovery of new dwarf galaxies , increasing substantially their known population in the local universe .",
    "moreover , in the past years , using hst observations , distances to individual members of nearby groups have been derived from magnitudes of the tip of the red giant branch by karachentsev and collaborators ( karachentsev 2005 and references therein ) , which have permitted a better membership assignment and a more trustful dynamical analysis .",
    "previous estimates of @xmath9 ratios for nearby groups were around @xmath10 ( huchra & geller 1982 ) .",
    "however , virial masses derived from the aforementioned data are significantly smaller , yielding @xmath9 ratios around 10 - 30 @xmath11",
    ". if these values are correct , the local matter density derived from nearby groups would be only a fraction of the global matter density ( karachentsev 2005 ) .",
    "however , for several groups the crossing time is comparable or even greater than the hubble time and another approach is necessary to evaluate their masses , since dynamical equilibrium is not yet attained in these cases .",
    "lynden - bell ( 1981 ) and sandage ( 1986 ) proposed an alternative method to the virial relation in order to estimate the mass of the local group , which can be extended to other systems dominated either by one or a pair of galaxies .",
    "their analysis is essentially based on the spherical infall model .",
    "if the motion of bound satellites is supposed to be radial , the resulting parametric equations describe a cycloid .",
    "initially , the radius of a given shell embedding a total mass m expands , attains a maximum value and then collapses . at maximum , when the turnaround radius r@xmath12 is reached ,",
    "the radial velocity with respect to the center of mass is zero . for a given group ,",
    "if the velocity field close to the main body , probed by satellites , allows the determination of r@xmath12 , then the mass can be calculated straightforwardly from the relation    @xmath13    where t@xmath12 is the age of the universe and g is the gravitational constant .",
    "data on the angular power spectrum of temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background radiation derived by wmap ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) and on the luminosity - distance of type ia supernovae ( riess et al . 1998 ; perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ) , lead to the so - called  concordant \" model , e.g. , a flat cosmological model in which @xmath14 = 0.3 and @xmath15 = 0.7 .",
    "the later density parameter corresponds to the present contribution of a cosmological constant term or a fluid with negative pressure , dubbed  quintessence \" or dark energy .",
    "the radial motion leading to the aforementioned @xmath16 relation neglects the effect of such a term , which acts as a  repulsive \" force .",
    "this repulsive force is proportional to the distance and its effect can be neglected if the zero - velocity surface is close to the center of mass .",
    "turnaround radii of groups are typically of the order of 1 mpc ( karachentsev 2005 ) , while the characteristic radius at which gravitation is comparable to the repulsion force is r@xmath17 = 1.1m@xmath18 mpc , where m@xmath19 = m/(10@xmath20 ) and the hubble parameter @xmath21 was taken equal to @xmath22 .",
    "this simple argument suggests that the effect of the cosmological term can not be neglected when deriving masses from the @xmath23 relationship .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the velocity - distance relationship when a dark energy term is included in the dynamical equations and calculate the resulting @xmath24 relation .",
    "the presence of the dark energy term has been also invoked as a possible explanation for the smoothness of the local hubble flow ( chernin 2001 ; teerikorpi , chernin and baryshev 2005 ) being a further reason to investigate its effects on the @xmath23 relation . for a cosmological density parameter associated to the  vacuum \" energy @xmath25 ( our preferred solution ) ,",
    "numerical computations indicate that the  zero - energy \" surface , beyond which galaxies will never collapse onto the core , is located at about 2.3@xmath26 . in order to illustrate our results",
    ", some applications are made to the local group and the virgo cluster .",
    "as we shall see , values of the hubble parameter resulting from fits of the actual data to the velocity - distance relation including a cosmological term , are in better agreement with recent estimates then those derived from the relation obtained either by lyndell - bell ( 1981 ) or sandage ( 1986 ) . in section 2",
    "the relevant equations are introduced , in sections 3 and 4 the results are applied to the local group and the virgo cluster and finally , in section 5 the concluding remarks are given .",
    "the evolution of a self - gravitating zero - pressure fluid with spherical symmetry was first considered by lematre ( 1933 ) and tolman ( 1934 ) .",
    "the lematre - tolman model describes quite well the dynamics of an extended halo around a bound central core , asymptotically approaching a homogeneous friedmann background . in this situation ,",
    "three main distinct regions can be distinguished : i ) the central core , in which the shell crossing has already occurred , leading to energy exchanges which transform radial into transverse motion ; ii ) the zero - velocity surface , boundary which separates infalling and expanding bound shells and iii ) the  marginally \" bound surface ( zero total energy ) , segregating bound and unbound shells .",
    "density profiles resulting from the lematre - tolman model were examined by olson & silk ( 1979 ) and application of this model to the velocity field close to the virgo cluster were made by hoffman et al .",
    "( 1980 ) , tully & shaya ( 1984 ) , teerikorpi et al . ( 1992 ) among others .    if displacements of galaxies , here associated to the outer halo shells , develop mainly at low redhsifts when the formation of the mass concentration around the core is nearly complete ( see , for instance , peebles 1990 ) , then the equation of motion for a spherical shell of mass @xmath27 , moving radially in the gravitational field created by a mass @xmath28 inside a shell of radius r , including the dark energy term is @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the scale parameter ( the present value is taken as @xmath32 = 1 ) .",
    "the latter satisfies the hubble equation @xmath33\\ ] ] here , the common assumption that the dark energy can be modeled as being a fluid with an equation of state @xmath7 was adopted and in the two equations above , the dependence of the dark energy on the scale parameter was obtained by solving the energy conservation for such a component .",
    "( 2 ) is intended to describe the motion of shells in the halo , excluding the central region where shell crossing effects have probably already occurred .",
    "defining the dimensionless variables @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) can be rewritten as @xmath37\\ ] ]    and    @xmath38    where we have introduced the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "these equations were solved numerically by adopting the following procedure . for a given redshift",
    ", the initial value of the scale parameter is derived as well as the corresponding instant of time from the hubble equation .",
    "if initially , at high redshifts ( here taken around @xmath41 ) , the dark energy term is negligible , then using a taylor expansion of the standard lematre - tolman solution , when the angle parameter @xmath42 ( see , for instance , peebles 1980 ) , the initial values of @xmath43 and its derivative @xmath44 can be estimated . for a given value of @xmath45 ,",
    "the parameter @xmath46 is varied until the condition defining the zero - velocity surface , e.g. , @xmath44 = 0 at @xmath43 = 1 is satisfied .",
    "for the case @xmath8 , we have obtained @xmath47 and for the particular case @xmath48 , representing a cosmological constant , @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , the mass inside the zero - velocity radius @xmath26 is    @xmath50    where @xmath51 and @xmath26 is in mpc . in the case",
    "@xmath8 , the numerical coefficient is slightly smaller ( 1.705 instead of 1.827 ) . comparing with eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we notice that the inclusion of the dark energy term represents , for a given @xmath26 , an _ increase _ of about 28 - 38% on the mass derived by such a procedure .    once the parameter @xmath46 is known , the velocity - distance relation , v = v(r ) , for different shells at a _ given time _ is obtained by varying their energy .",
    "shells with negative energy will expand , halt and fall back toward the center , while shells with positive energy expand forever , according to the aforementioned characterization of regions @xmath52 and @xmath53 . at a given time , there is a critical energy @xmath54 which defines the zero - velocity radius .",
    "shells having @xmath55 have already crossed the turnaround point and are collapsing .",
    "consequently , they have _ negative _ velocities . shells with @xmath56 are still expanding and thus have _ positive _ velocities .",
    "for the case @xmath48 , which gives a good representation of actual data , as we shall see in the next sections , the resulting numerical values are quite well fitted by the relation    @xmath57    with @xmath58 .",
    "notice that from the condition @xmath59 , eq .",
    "( 6 ) is recovered .",
    "it is worth mentioning that solutions with negative energies are possible up to @xmath60 , which defines the marginally bound surface . beyond this critical radius ,",
    "only unbound shells exist .",
    "the solution for @xmath61 differs only marginally and will not be considered in further analyses",
    ".    for comparison , the velocity - distance relationship derived for the case @xmath62 is    @xmath63    which has a slightly flatter dependence on the distance than the precedent equation .",
    "an immediate application of the velocity - distance relationship is the determination of the local group mass , concentrated mainly on m31 and the milky way , as well as the hubble parameter itself as we shall see later .",
    "moreover , the velocity - distance relation gives also an indication of the dispersion of the peculiar velocities over the hubble flow .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the local velocity dispersion is known to be quite small ( giraud 1986 ; schlegel et al .",
    "1994 ) , a fact referred usually as the  coldness \" of the local flow",
    ". an investigation of the dynamics of the local group and its environment by using numerical simulations was performed by governato et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who concluded that cold dark matter models ( @xmath64 ) are unable to produce candidates embedded in regions having  cold \" flows .    as a first step ,",
    "we have searched to check the accuracy of eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) by using numerical simulations .",
    "we have performed n - body simulations using the adaptive particle - particle / particle - mesh @xmath65 code hydra ( couchman et al .",
    "1995 ) , with cosmological parameters h = 0.65 , @xmath14 = 0.3 , @xmath15 = 0.7 and @xmath66 = 0.9 .",
    "the simulation was performed in a periodic box of side 30@xmath67 mpc including 256@xmath68 particles , corresponding to a mass resolution of @xmath69 .",
    "the simulation started at z = 49 and ended at the present time .",
    "halos were initially detected by using a friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm and , in a second step , unbound particles were removed by an iterative procedure .",
    "thus , all halos in our catalog are gravitationally bound objects . for further details ,",
    "the reader is referred to peirani et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .    in our mock halo catalog , several examples of pairs with physical characteristics similar to the mw - m31 pair can be found . however , most of them have nearby ( within 3 - 5 mpc ) halos of comparable mass or even higher , which perturb considerably the velocity field . here , for illustration purposes only , we consider one case in which the main halos have masses respectively equal to @xmath70 and @xmath71 solar masses and are separated by a distance of 0.69 mpc , parameters comparable to those of the m31-mw pair .",
    "about 73 subhalos were detected within 3 mpc of this pair , but satellites situated at distances larger than 2 mpc are clearly perturbed by other nearby structures , since the velocity dispersion increases considerably at those distances .",
    "velocities and distances with respect to the center of mass were computed for all these objects .",
    "a simple fitting of these simulated data gives @xmath72 mpc and using eq .",
    "( 6 ) with h = 0.65 ( adopted in the simulations ) a total mass of @xmath73 is obtained . in spite of the excellent agreement with the actual total mass of the pair ,",
    "this result is somewhat fortuitous since the velocity dispersion of the simulated satellites is rather high . in practice , besides random motions , errors in distances or velocities increase considerably the uncertainty in the determination of the zero - velocity radius .",
    "these difficulties can be alleviated by searching the best fit of the v = v(r ) relation to data . by varying the mass in order to minimize the velocity dispersion and giving a higher weight to the inner satellites , one obtains @xmath74 .",
    "this result seems to be more confident to evaluate the uncertainties of the method .",
    "it is worth mentioning that quoted errors are estimates based on the spread of values derived from the fitting procedure and not formal statistical errors . in figure 1",
    "we show the simulated velocity - distance data for satellites with @xmath75 1.8 mpc and the best fit solution for eq .",
    "the derived 1-d velocity dispersion for this simulated data is 73 kms@xmath76 , a value lower than that derived by governato et al .",
    "( 1997 ) but in quite good agreement with the @xmath77cdm simulations by macci et al .",

    "recent data on neighboring galaxies of the local group were summarized by karachentsev et al .",

    "( 1 ) a total mass of @xmath79 for the m31/mw pair .    here , eq . ( 7 ) was fitted to the data by karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , but varying now both the mass and the hubble parameter in order to minimize the velocity dispersion .",
    "we have obtained @xmath80 and @xmath81 , where the quoted errors are again estimates based on the uncertainties of the fitted parameters .",
    "figure 2 shows data points and the velocity - distance relation defined by the previous parameters .",
    "had we used eq .",
    "( 8) instead of eq .",
    "( 7 ) in the fitting procedure , a similar result for the mass would have been obtained , but with a _ higher _ hubble parameter , e.g. , @xmath82 .",
    "we shall return to this point latter .",
    "the zero - velocity radius is located at @xmath83 mpc , which is about 10% higher than the value estimated by karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and the  marginally \" bound surface ( zero - energy ) is at a distance of about 2.3 mpc . from our fit",
    "it results a 1-d velocity dispersion of 39 kms@xmath76 , which should be compared with the value of 73 km / s found from our simulated data for a similar scale .",
    "macci et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have also revisited the  coldness \" of the hubble flow and , according to their final results , within a sphere of radius 3 mpc , the expected velocity dispersion is 38 kms@xmath76 , in rather good agreement with our figure .",
    "dynamical models for the virgo cluster based on the lematre - tolman model were , for instance , developed by hoffman et al .",
    "they have modeled the projected velocity dispersion as a function of the angular distance and , from comparison with data , derived a mass of @xmath84 contained inside a sphere of @xmath85 radius , which corresponds approximately to the central relaxed core of the cluster . using the virial relation , tully & shaya ( 1984 ) obtained a mass of @xmath86 for this central core .",
    "more recently , fouqu et al . ( 2001 ) using the lematre - tolman model derived a mass of @xmath87 inside a radius of @xmath88 .    in this section , the derived velocity - distance relation ( eq .",
    "7 ) , including effects of the cosmological constant , will be applied to galaxies outside the inner core of the virgo cluster .",
    "galaxies with virgocentric distances higher than 1.7 mpc , corresponding approximately to the core radius , and less than 15 mpc , were selected from the list by teerikorpi et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , constituting a sub - sample of 27 objects .",
    "distances derived from the tully - fisher relation were taken from the aforementioned source .",
    "heliocentric velocities were corrected with respect to the local group according to the prescription by courteau and van den bergh ( 1999 ) .",
    "velocities and distances with respect to virgo center were calculated by assuming a distance to the cluster of 16.8 mpc ( tully & shaya 1984 ) and an observed velocity of 967 km / s ( kraan - korteweg 1981 ) .",
    "the best fit of eq .",
    "( 7 ) to data gives @xmath89 and @xmath90 , corresponding to a velocity dispersion @xmath91 km / s for the flow .",
    "figure 3 shows the velocity - distance data for the galaxies of our sample and the theoretical v = v(r ) relation computed with the derived parameters .",
    "the higher mass derived in the present analysis confirms some early results based on models of the velocity field in the vicinity of the virgo cluster using the lematre - tolman equations , as those performed by tully & shaya ( 1998 ) and fouqu et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "the resulting zero - velocity surface is located at @xmath92 mpc , which at the assumed distance corresponds to an angle @xmath93 .",
    "this should be compared with the analyses by hoffman et al .",
    "( 1980 ) , tully & shaya ( 1984 ) or teerikorpi et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , who estimated @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively .",
    "( 7 ) , with the above parameters , predicts that at the level of the local group the observed velocity should be 988 km / s , which compares quite well with the observed value .",
    "this indicates that the projection of the peculiar velocity of the local group in the virgo direction is about 190 km / s , compatible with the values found by de freitas pacheco ( 1985 ) , tamman & sandage ( 1985 ) and federspiel et al .",
    "the marginally bound surface is located at about 19.8 mpc , implying that the local group is bound to the cluster .",
    "the contribution of a dark energy term in the mass - energy budget of the universe seems to be well established at the present time . in this study ,",
    "the usual velocity - distance relation based on the lematre - tolman model , was revisited in order to include effects due to such a cosmological term .",
    "the dynamical equations were solved numerically and the relation @xmath96 , defining the mass inside the zero - velocity surface was recalculated . for a given @xmath26 ,",
    "the resulting masses are about 35 - 38% _ higher _ with respect to the original relation derived from the lematre - bondi model ( @xmath62 ) , if the dark energy is modeled by a fluid with an equation of state @xmath97 or by a cosmological constant respectively .",
    "the resulting v = v(r ) relation ( @xmath48 case ) was applied to the local group and to the virgo cluster . from the best fitting procedure ,",
    "a mass of @xmath98 was derived for the m31-mw system , which corresponds to a m / l ratio of about 25 @xmath11 .",
    "the zero - velocity surface and the  marginally \" bound surface are located at about @xmath83 mpc and 2.3 mpc respectively .",
    "the later defines in fact the boundaries of the local group .",
    "more sophisticated analyses of the local group based on the action principle were performed by peebles ( 1990 ) . in this method , orbits are reconstructed in order to reproduce the observed radial velocities , maintaining the action stationary .",
    "peebles ( 1990 ) preferred solution implies a mass of 6.4@xmath99 for the local group , a factor 2.5 higher than our result , but a comparison of these results could be meaningless since a different cosmology ( @xmath100 = 0.1 ) was adopted in that work .",
    "the same procedure applied to the virgo cluster gives a mass of about @xmath101 inside a radius of @xmath102 mpc .",
    "this mass is higher than the virial value ( tully & shaya 1984 ) or values derived from velocity dispersion profiles computed from models based on the lematre - tolman model ( hoffman et al .",
    "however , recent studies of the velocity field based on the lematre - tolman formulation also lead to masses compatible with our result .",
    "our velocity - distance relation predicts a peculiar velocity of the local group towards the virgo cluster of about 190 km / s , compatible with different estimates .",
    "the  marginally \" bound surface encloses the local group , which in the future may attain its zero - velocity surface and then fall onto the cluster",
    ". however this prediction is based on a model in which the local group is considered as an  isolated \" system . in reality",
    "the motion of the local group is much more complex , being strongly affected by large mass concentrations in the direction of hydra - centaurus ( great attractor ) and the shapley supercluster .",
    "some numerical simulations predict that within @xmath103 30 gyr the local group will get closer to the virgo center ( in comoving coordinates ) , but then will be pulled away(in physical coordinates ) due to the accelerated expansion of the universe ( nagamine & loeb 2003 ) .",
    "the introduction of a cosmological constant term modifies the velocity - distance relation in comparison with that derived from the lematre - tolman model . nevertheless both descriptions of the velocity field near the local group or the virgo cluster yield masses comparable to within a factor of two .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that errors still present in distance estimates mask differences between both models .",
    "however , when searching for a best fit of both models to data , there is a substantial difference in the resulting hubble parameter .",
    "the lematre - tolman model requires h in the range 0.87 - 0.92 in order to fit adequately the local group and virgo data respectively , whereas eq.(7 ) requires h in the range 0.65 - 0.74 , more consistent with recent determinations and with the  concordant \" model . in this sense",
