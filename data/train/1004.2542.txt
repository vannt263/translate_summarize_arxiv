    "currently , direct - sequence code division multiple access ( ds - cdma ) wireless networks is widely deployed @xcite , such as in ieee @xmath0b . at the link layer of such networks , the automatic repeat request ( arq )",
    "protocol is usually used to ensure the reliable delivery of packets with cyclic redundancy check ( crc ) to check whether the received packet has errors .",
    "if the error in the received packet is detected by crc , the erroneous packet is discarded and retransmission is requested by the receiver .",
    "there are many possible causes for errors , such as a non - ideal state of channel between the transmitter and receiver , collision of packets in random access networks and so on . to address the packet collision problem , ieee @xmath0 wireless networks employ carrier sense multiple access(csma ) and the request - to - send(rts)/clear - to - send(cts ) mechanisms at the mac layer @xcite .",
    "however , retransmissions are not completely avoided because erroneous receptions still happen .",
    "therefore , arq is employed to guarantee quality of service ( qos ) .",
    "arq with a limit on the maximum number of retransmissions , called truncated arq , is applied to reduce the delay and buffer size @xcite . in truncated arq ,",
    "if a packet still has errors after being retransmitted for the maximum number of times defined , the packet will be discarded and a packet loss is announced .",
    "the truncated arq can improve the packet error rate ( per ) , but it can not achieve throughput gains . this is because more transmission time is required for better per performance .",
    "moreover , if the channel between source and destination is in a poor state , the performance of throughput can not be improved with the increases in number of retransmissions . recently",
    ", a partial packet recovery scheme was proposed to improve the throughput performance in @xcite . in the traditional arq scheme ,",
    "the entire packet is retransmitted even though there may be only one error in the packet .",
    "the basic idea behind partial packet recovery is to retransmit only the erroneous bits if a received packet can not pass the crc . in the partial packet recovery scheme ,",
    "the receiver knows probably error bits position in the received packet with a unreliable decoded bits detection .",
    "the threshold method can be applied in the unreliable decoded bits detection . according to the results of unreliable decoded bits detection",
    ", the receiver feeds back a request message to the transmitter so that the transmitter is aware of which part of the packets needs retransmission .",
    "the size of request message feedback from the receiver to the transmitter is a key issue for the partial packet recovery .",
    "when the request message costs too many bits to feed back from the receiver , the throughput will decrease . a feedback strategy based on the cost evaluation",
    "is used to solve the feedback request issue .",
    "cooperative transmission techniques can provide diversity gains through relays in the fading wireless channel @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a cooperative packet recovery scheme is proposed .",
    "it requires retransmission of the entire packet , and combines confidence information across multiple copies of a packet from multiple access points which are connected by wired ethernet .",
    "in fact , this is equivalent to a multiple antenna receiver scheme without the assistance of relay . in @xcite ,",
    "the truncated cooperative arq scheme is proposed to obtain throughput gains by the relay - assisted method , where sources and relays use an orthogonal space - time block code ( stbc ) to retransmit the entire packets .",
    "however , this scheme requires close synchronization of the source and relays for stbc to work , and coordinating different transmitters in the wireless network can be difficult .    to overcome the synchronization challenge , interleave - division multiple - access ( idma ) has the advantage that it works in an asynchronous cooperative communication network scenario @xcite .",
    "idma provides a good interference cancellation performance .",
    "moreover , the multi - user detection ( mud ) in idma has a linear complexity , implying a lower cost than the mmse - based mud which has polynomial complexity in cdma @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a scenario is described where multiple source - destination pairs are assisted by multiple common relays based on idma .",
    "the work in @xcite shows that idma relays at different locations provide different diversity gains for the multiple source - destination pairs .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a relay - assisted partial packet recovery scheme . in our scheme ,",
    "idma is applied as a partial packet recovery method .",
    "we not only bring diversity gains into the partial packet recovery with relays , but also take advantage of idma for recovering multiple erroneous packets .",
    "the proposed idma partial packet recovery can be used to recover the erroneous packet under the following scenario : a wireless network that is under heavy load may have to handle more than one corrupted packet at the same time slot .",
    "an example of this scenario is when csma and rts / cts fail to avoid the collision between two source packets .",
    "if both source packets are intending for the same destination , the receiver at the destination will be required to handle the partial packet recovery for more than one packet at the same time .",
    "hence , more than one packets need to recover at the destination in the partial packet recovery scheme . to recover the multiple erroneous packets ,",
    "the idma mud may concurrently receive and separate all retransmitted partial packets from multiple relays for multiple source s packet .",
    "in addition , the asynchronous property of iterative chip - by - chip mud mechanism in our proposed idma scheme enables the receiver to extract multiple partial packets of different sizes . because the size of different retransmitted partial packets may be different in the case of multiple partial packets recovery .",
    "the simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperform the traditional arq .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we introduce the system model . in section iii , we present the proposed idma - based partial packet recovery scheme .",
    "section iv , we show the simulation result . in section",

    "the roles of all nodes are fixed in the network , i.e. , relay nodes will not act as a source node at different time slot .",
    "each node works in the half - duplex mode and bpsk is used for the modulation .",
    "the relay - assisted partial packet recovery protocol divides the operation into three time slots . in the first time slot ,",
    "source nodes transmit their signal to a group of relays and the destination .",
    "all transmissions in the first time slot are based on cdma .",
    "this assumes that csma and rts / cts have not prevented more than one active source to transmit at the same time in the network . in the second time slot , the destination uses crc to check whether the received packets have errors . if no error is found , the destination broadcast an ack message to the sources and the group of relays . in the third time slot , after seeing the ack message , sources will proceed to transmit the next packet in their queues , and relays will erase the packet received during the first time slot and proceed to receive the next packet . on the other hand ,",
    "if crc error is detected at destination in the second time slot , the destination broadcasts a feedback request message on the feedback channel .",
    "this request message includes the information describing which part of the packet needs retransmission .",

    "the unreliable bits detection block in figure [ partialidmareceiver ] uses the confidence information to detect unreliable bits in the received packet .",
    "it then feeds back a retransmission request for these unreliable bits .",
    "multiple partial packets retransmitted by multiple relays are received by the idma partial packet receiver , which utilizes the chip - by - chip multiuser detection to separate the different sizes of partial packets , denoted by @xmath21 and @xmath22 blocks .",
    "the received partial packets will be input to the error bits repair block , where the unreliable bits will be replaced by the retransmitted bits and the multiple partial packets recovery is finally completed .",
    "the partial packet recovery with idma method is activated only if the received packet is detected to have the error in crc .",
    "the improvement of throughput brought by partial packet recovery is due to save the time to retransmit the correct bits .",
