    "i.e. , _ the tetrahedrally surrounded fe sites are occupied by @xmath7 atoms , whereas the octahedrally coordinated fe sites are occupied by @xmath8 atoms . the latter form a pyrochlore lattice , which consists of a network of corner sharing tetrahedra .",
    "ferrimagnetism is stable in @xmath1 , with magnetic moments of @xmath7 sites antiparallel to those of @xmath8 sites .",
    "@xmath1 undergoes a first order metal - insulator transition ( called verwey transition ) at around 120 k , where the resistivity of @xmath1 increases by two orders of magnitude .",
    "@xcite this phase transition accompanies a change in the crystal structure of @xmath1 , from cubic to monoclinic symmetry .",
    "verwey proposed that the metal - insulator transition originates from a charge ordering at the @xmath8 sites ( @xmath9_{b}o_{4}^{2-}}$ ] ) , similar to strongly correlated hole - doped manganites .",
    "@xcite a full charge localization with ideal @xmath10 and @xmath11 does not occur , since the charge disproportionation is much smaller than the ideal 3+/4 + ionic picture , due to strong covalency effects .",
    "anderson pointed out that , when putting two @xmath12 and two @xmath13 on each @xmath8 tetrahedron , the number of @xmath12 and @xmath13 pairs is maximized and this gives rise to the lowest energy from the coulomb repulsion point of view .",
    "@xcite however , the anderson criterion for low temperature @xmath1 are inconsistent with recent experiment results . @xcite as such , the charge ordering occurring at the verwey transition in @xmath1 is still under discussion .",
    "ferroelectricity has been recently observed at low temperatures in @xmath1 and attracted great scientific interests .",
    "@xcite khomskii _ et al .",

    "@xcite    in contrast to our previous study , in this paper we focus on noncentrosymmetric @xmath2 ( no.3 ) structure in order to realize the picture proposed by khomskii , where the ferroelectric polarization arises from the fe@xmath16/fe@xmath17 dimerization .",

    "@xcite according to their idea , when either site - centered or bond - centered charge orderings happen individually , a system does not have a net dipole moment : however , if the site - centered and bond - centered charge orderings occur simultaneously in a system , the inversion symmetry is broken so that the system shows a net dipole moment , therefore becoming ferroelectric ( _ cf_. fig.[dimmer ] ) .",
    "@xcite based on this scenario , khomskii _ et al .",
    "_ have proposed that @xmath1 could become ferroelectric , with the monoclinic @xmath4 axis as polarization direction .",

    "this situation indeed corresponds to the site / bond - centered charge ordering proposed by khomskii _",
    "et al _ @xcite . , the so called `` zener polaron '' .    generally , the origin of bond dimerization in other multiferroic materials is the spin configuration , _",
    "e.g. , _ in @xmath20 the bond lengths between antiparallel ( parallel ) mn ions are expanded ( contracted ) so as to optimize the double exchange mechanism .",
    "@xcite there is , however , no correlation between the dimerization process and the spin configuration in @xmath1 , since all the spin directions of @xmath8 sites are the same .",
    "et al . _ have proposed the bond length modulation to be due to the simple classical inter - site coulomb repulsion between charge ordered @xmath10 and @xmath11 sites , _",
    "i.e. , _ below the verwey temperature the corner sharing @xmath8 tetrahedra are constructed by three @xmath11 and one @xmath10 ions or by three @xmath10 and one @xmath11 ions ( 3 - 1 charge order ) , at variance with the anderson criterion in which the configurations of two @xmath10 and two @xmath11 ions ( 2 - 2 charge order ) are most stable @xcite , as shown in fig.[tetra_inter ] .",

    "as shown in the upper part of table [ table3 ] and fig.[tetra_inter ] , there are alternations of @xmath50 and @xmath51 bond lengths between @xmath8 sites , leading to the @xmath12/@xmath13 bond dimerization along the @xmath4 axis , so that the corner sharing tetrahedra formed by @xmath8 sites are strongly distorted from ideal regular tetrahedra .",

    "@xcite we note that , when @xmath3 is set to zero , there is neither charge order nor bond dimerization of @xmath8 sites , due to metallicity .",
    "the key point here is the @xmath3 dependence of charge separations between @xmath8 sites .",
    "our results indicate that , upon increasing @xmath3 , the charge separation in @xmath8 sites increases , due to the fact that electrons are more localized for large @xmath3 . therefore , upon increasing the charge separations in @xmath8 sites , one expects the inter - site coulomb interactions to more strongly distort the @xmath8 tetrahedra , implying a larger tendency towards bond dimerization between @xmath8 sites .",

    "this large difference is due to strong enhancement of dipole moments by the wannier centers displaced from atomic centers .",
    "such enhancement of polarization is of course not taken into consideration in the point charge model .",
    "additionally , calculated polarizations decrease when increasing the @xmath3 value .",
    "the obtained results are consistent with the @xmath56/@xmath57 bond dimerizations discussed in sec.[dimerization ] . as increasing @xmath3 ,",
    "the @xmath10/@xmath11 dimerizations are suppressed , so it can be easily understood that if the bond dimerization between @xmath10 and @xmath11 sites disappears , polarization caused by the site / bond - centered charge ordering vanishes .",
    "another important point here is the polarization with large @xmath3 values . as shown in fig.[polarization ] , polarizations calculated by the point charge model and the berry phase method for large @xmath3 approach the same value .",
    "this can be understood as follows : upon increasing @xmath3 , electrons are more localized on fe ions .",
    "therefore , since the wannier centers get closer to @xmath8 sites and there is no enhancement of dipole moments by the displacements of the wannier centers , the point charge model and the berry phase method have similar values for large @xmath3 .",

    "<S> based on _ ab initio _ density functional theory , we have investigated a microscopic mechanism that leads to @xmath0 dimerization and consequent ferroelectricity in charge ordered @xmath1 with @xmath2 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the simple inter - site coulomb repulsion , quantum hybridization effects are invoked to explain the @xmath0 bond dimerization . </S>",
    "<S> our results , based on the generalized gradient approximation + hubbard @xmath3 ( gga+@xmath3 ) method , indicate that noncentrosymmetric @xmath2 magnetite shows a finite and sizeable ferroelectric polarization along the @xmath4 crystalline axis . from the @xmath3 dependence of polarization </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude that the origin of ferroelectricity in @xmath2 @xmath1 lies in the recently proposed  intermediate site / bond - centered charge ordering \" . </S>"
