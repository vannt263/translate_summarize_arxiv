    "it has been almost a decade since observations of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) were first found to support the notion that our universe is currently undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion @xcite . since that time , evidence in favour of this accelerated expansion has strengthened significantly as the result of further sne ia observations @xcite , improved measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and surveys of large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite .",
    "the precise cause of this late - time acceleration , however , remains unknown .",
    "if general relativity is accurate on astrophysical scales , then the assumptions of large - scale homogeneity and isotropy require that the agent responsible for the universe s acceleration , dubbed ` dark energy ' , behave cosmologically as a fluid with negative pressure .",
    "the standard model of particle physics predicts only one such fluid : the vacuum energy , or cosmological constant , for which the pressure , @xmath7 , is always equal to minus the energy density , @xmath8 .",
    "however , if the vacuum energy density is indeed non - zero then it is generally expected to be of the order of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the planck - mass .",
    "this is some @xmath11 orders of magnitude larger than the observed dark energy density .",
    "a number of proposals have therefore been made in the literature for models in which dark energy is dynamical and associated with some new form of energy @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the present small size of the effective cosmological constant is by - product of the age of universe .",
    "the acceleration of the universe might alternatively be explained by modifying general relativity rather than postulating a new form of energy ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it also been suggested that the universe is not accelerating at all , but that a large local inhomogeneity prevents the sne ia data from being correctly interpreted in terms of a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model @xcite .",
    "this said , dynamical dark energy ( hereafter dde ) is by far the most popular candidate to explain the current astronomical data . in the simplest dde models , known as quintessence",
    ", dark energy is associated with the energy density of a scalar field with a canonical kinetic structure .",
    "if dark energy does indeed exist then astronomical observations presently provide us with only hints as to its nature . we know that today it represents about @xmath12 of the total energy density of the universe , and that its equation of state ( eos ) parameter , @xmath13 , is fairly close to @xmath14 : @xmath15 for @xmath16 , @xcite",
    "furthermore , if matter dominates the expansion of the universe for @xmath17 then @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "hence , dark energy has negative pressure at higher redshifts with a @xmath19 confidence .",
    "these bounds on @xmath20 are entirely consistent with a pure cosmological constant .",
    "whilst detecting either @xmath21 or @xmath22 would rule out a cosmological constant , in many dde models significant deviations from @xmath23 only occur at early times and as such would be difficult to detect .",
    "the late time , background cosmology predicted by many dde models is therefore very similar to that of a universe with a true cosmological constant .",
    "dde models generally cease to mimic a cosmological constant in inhomogeneous backgrounds or when one considers cosmological perturbation theory . in particular , a number of authors have studied the effect of dde on the formation of large scale structure @xcite . in the vast majority of these works the energy density of dark energy",
    "is taken to be homogeneous i.e. it is assumed that dde does _ not _ cluster .",
    "the extent to which this assumption of homogeneity is valid has been the subject of some interest and much debate in the literature . in an inhomogeneous background ,",
    "the dde energy density and eos parameter should exhibit some spatial variations .",
    "the key issue of how large these variations should be is however far from settled , particularly when the matter perturbation goes non - linear @xcite . in this paper",
    "we attempt to settle this issue for uncoupled quintessence models by deriving an analytical expression for the dark energy contrast , @xmath4 , in by presence of a matter perturbation .",
    "importantly , we do _ not _ constrain the matter perturbation to be small ( i.e. linear ) .",
    "clustering of dde over scales smaller than about @xmath24 has been the subject of a number of recent articles @xcite .",
    "most attention has been focussed on models in which the dde couples to baryonic and/or dark matter since dde clustering is expected to be strongest in such theories @xcite .",
    "in other works , a more phenomenological approach has been taken and the observables associated with dde clustering have been parametrized .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that inhomogeneities in dark energy could produce detectable signatures on the cmb @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite considered the growth of spatial dde perturbations in the _ absence _ of any matter coupling .",
    "they considered only those circumstances where both the density contrast of matter , @xmath25 , and that of the dde , @xmath4 , were small enough to be treated as a linearized perturbations about a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological background .",
    "they studied the simplest class of quintessence models where dark energy is associated with the slow - roll of a scalar field @xmath26 down a potential @xmath27 ; @xmath26 is minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "the authors linearized the full field equations for @xmath26 , the matter and the metric and solved the resulting system numerically .",
    "intriguingly they found that , at late times , a local overdensity of matter corresponded to a local under - density , or void , of dark energy .",
    "conversely , a void in the matter was seen to produce a local dde overdensity . although the dde density contrast , @xmath4 , is initially very small compared to the matter density contrast , @xmath25 , they found that , when @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath4 was also observed to be growing more quickly than @xmath25 at late times .",
    "their results suggest that dde clustering may induce a positive correction to the value of @xmath30 of more than @xmath31 at the centre of an inhomogeneity with properties similar to that of the local supercluster ( hereafter lsc ) . if accurate",
    ", the results of @xcite imply that any deviations from @xmath32 would be significantly amplified by the presence of a local overdensity of matter .",
    "furthermore , they suggest that dde clustering might be relatively strong when the matter perturbation goes non - linear .    @xcite studied dde clustering when the matter perturbation is growing in the linear regime , which is only accurate when @xmath33 .",
    "they considered the evolution @xmath4 for a cluster of matter with initial density profile ( at @xmath34 ) of @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the initial value of the hubble parameter .",
    "however , in the absence of any dde , the linear approximation would generally cease to be accurate when @xmath39 ; additionally the perturbation would be expected to turnaround when @xmath40 and virialise when @xmath41 .",
    "it is therefore far from clear whether or not the sharp late - time growth in @xmath4 found by @xcite is indeed a physical effect , or just a result of using linearized field equations outside of realm in which they are valid .",
    "although one might well expect there exist some mapping between the linear and non - linear regimes as it happens in an einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "in this paper we investigate a similar problem to that considered by @xcite , i.e. the clustering of uncoupled quintessence on sub - horizon scales .",
    "there are , however , two important differences between our approach to this problem and the one taken by @xcite :    1 .",
    "firstly , we do _ not _ use numerical simulations but instead use the method of matched asymptotic expansions ( maes ) to develop a analytical approximation to @xmath4 .",
    "2 .   secondly , we do _ not _ require the density contrast of the matter perturbation , @xmath25 , to be small .",
    "indeed , our analysis and results remain valid even after the virialisation of the matter overdensity .",
    "our approximation for @xmath4 is accurate provided that @xmath42 is only non - linear ( @xmath43 ) on sub - horizon scales .",
    "this provision is consistent with observations . for simplicity",
    "we take the matter perturbation to be spherical symmetric .",
    "we also require that gravity is suitably weak whenever the inhomogeneity is non - linear i.e. @xmath44 .",
    "we restate these requirements in a rigorous fashion later , however they are essentially equivalent to the statement that gravity is approximately newtonian over scales smaller than @xmath45 .",
    "since dde clustering in the linear regime has been dealt with in great detail by @xcite , our main focus in this paper is on what occurs when the matter perturbation goes non - linear .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we describe our model for an inhomogeneous spacetime and the dde .",
    "we state the equations that must be satisfied by the metric quantities and the dark energy scalar field @xmath26 . in section [ sec : small ] we introduce the method of matched asymptotic expansions ( maes ) .",
    "this method relies the existence of locally small parameters , and we state what these are for our model and interpret them physically .",
    "we also note what constraints the smallness of these parameters places upon our analysis . in section [ sec : evo ] we apply the method of maes to the evolution of dynamical dark energy perturbations .",
    "we derive a simple equation for the dde density contrast , @xmath4 , in terms of the peculiar velocity of matter particles , @xmath46 , and the matter density contrast , @xmath25 .",
    "importantly this equation is equally as valid for @xmath47 ( ` the non - linear regime ' ) as it is when @xmath48 ( ` the linear regime ' ) . in section [ sec : ddeclust ]",
    "we use our results to study the evolution of @xmath4 in the linear ( @xmath49 ) , quasi - linear ( @xmath50 ) and fully non - linear ( @xmath51 ) regimes .",
    "we compare our analytical results with those found numerically in the linear regime by @xcite .",
    "in section [ sec : app ] we consider the spatial profile of the dde density contrast for realistic astrophysical inhomogeneities such as voids , supervoids , clusters and superclusters .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : con ] with a discussion of our results and their observational implications .",
    "we also note how our analysis might be extended to include even more general dde models .    throughout the paper",
    "we use units where @xmath52 .",
    "our aim in this paper is to derive an expression for the dde density contrast , @xmath53 , inside an over - density , or under - density , of matter .",
    "henceforth we use @xmath54 to represent the energy density of a component @xmath55 .",
    "we are particularly interested in those cases where the matter perturbation is non - linear i.e. @xmath56 .",
    "although we aim to remain suitably general in our treatment of the density perturbation , we do make the following simplifying assumptions :    * we assume spherical symmetry .",
    "we briefly discuss the extent to which the relaxation of this assumption would affect our results in section [ sec : con ] below , and conclude that the qualitative nature of our findings would be unaffected .",
    "* we define a ` physical radial coordinate ' , @xmath57 , by the requirement that a spherical surface with physical radius @xmath57 has surface area @xmath58 .",
    "we assume that all curvature invariants are regular at @xmath59 i.e. we do not consider those cases in which there is a central black hole .",
    "we argue below , however , that our results are still accurate even when there is a central black - hole , provided they are only applied at radii that are large compared to the schwarzschild radius of the black hole . *",
    "finally we assume that for radii smaller than some @xmath60 gravity is suitably _ weak _ in the inhomogeneous region ; @xmath61 is the hubble parameter of the background spacetime .",
    "we define what we mean by _ weak _ rigorously in section [ sec : small ] . for radii @xmath62",
    ", we require that the matter density contrast is @xmath63 .",
    "this assumption holds for most realistic models of collapsing overdensities provided that the radius the overdense region is less than about @xmath64 .",
    "we take the matter content of the universe to be a mix of irrotational dust and dynamical dark energy , which is described by a scalar field @xmath26 . for simplicity",
    "we restrict ourselves to considering only spherically symmetric spacetimes for which the most general line element in comoving coordinates is : @xmath65 we make the definitions @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this coordinate choice is unique up to @xmath68 , and @xmath69 . with these definitions the 2-spheres @xmath70 have surface area @xmath71 , and in this sense @xmath72 represents the ` physical radial coordinate ' .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of pressureless dust is given by @xmath73 and the energy - momentum tensor of the scalar field , @xmath26 , is @xmath74 the einstein equations for this metric read : @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",

    "if we define @xmath86 so that @xmath87 for some @xmath88 , then @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the mass inside a shell of radius @xmath86 at @xmath91 .",

    "( [ phieqn ] ) is subject to the boundary conditions : @xmath94 at @xmath59 , and @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the solution of eq .",
    "( [ phieqn ] ) in the cosmological background .",
    "we make the following definitions : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is defined by @xmath99 .",
    "we also define : @xmath100 integrating eqs .",
    "( [ tteqn ] ) and ( [ rreqn ] ) and using eqs .",

    "one can think of the small parameters approach and the matched asymptotic expansions as an expansion in the newtonian potential .",
    "although it is perhaps fairer to say that is closest to the context of general relativity .",
    "the differences are not obvious at leading order but at next to leading order one will see that what appears in the equation for the acceleration is not necessarily what one would expect to appear in the non - relativistic regime .    as stated above in section [ sec : geo ] , we require that gravity is ` suitably weak ' inside the density perturbation . by suitably weak we mean that @xmath109 where @xmath110 physically @xmath111 is the velocity of a particle of dust in @xmath112 coordinates , where @xmath57 is the physical radial coordinate , and @xmath113 is the velocity that such a particle would have in the cosmological background . the small parameter @xmath114 is therefore the peculiar velocity of a matter particle with respect to the cosmological background . recall that we use units where @xmath115 , hence the first expression above is in fact the dimensionless quantity @xmath116 .",
    "our assumption requires that whenever @xmath117 , we have @xmath118 . this condition is equivalent to requiring that the mean matter density contrast , @xmath119 , inside the sphere with radius @xmath120 or greater , is small enough that it may be treated as a linear perturbation about the cosmological background .",
    "the mean matter perturbation is however allowed to be non - linear , @xmath121 , when @xmath122 provided @xmath123 .",
    "we also define @xmath124 we require @xmath125 .",
    "this again require that @xmath126 only when @xmath122 i.e. the matter perturbation is only non - linear on sub - horizon scales .",
    "we note that @xmath127 , and so generally @xmath128 provided @xmath129 .    in what follows",
    "we assume that @xmath130 and @xmath131 are small _",
    "everywhere_. these assumptions can be checked once one specifies initial conditions for the matter overdensity , but they generally hold very well whenever the scale of the inhomogeneous region is @xmath132 .",
    "we now define two over - lapping regions which we shall refer to as the interior and the exterior .",
    "the _ interior region _ is defined by @xmath133 we define the _ inner limit _ of a quantity @xmath134 to be @xmath135 .",
    "the inner limit can be imagined as the limit in which the cosmological background density of matter is taken to zero , and the cosmological horizon is taken to infinity . in the interior we construct asymptotic approximations to quantities in the limit @xmath136 .",
    "we also expand in @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "we refer to this as the _ inner approximation_.      in the _ exterior region _ , spacetime is required to be homogeneous and isotropic at leading order . in other words ,",
    "the matter perturbation must be linear in the exterior : @xmath137 from the form of @xmath111 , it is clear that @xmath138 implies @xmath139 .",
    "we define the _ exterior limit _ of a quantity @xmath134 to be @xmath140 . as in the interior limit",
    "we also expand in @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "we construct asymptotic approximations to quantities in the exterior region in this exterior limit and refer to them as the _ outer approximations_.      we are primarily concerned with the behaviour of the dde in the interior region . in section [ sec : evo ] , we find the inner approximation to @xmath26 by solving eq .",
    "( [ phieqn ] ) order by order in the interior limit .",
    "we can not , however , apply both of the boundary conditions on @xmath26 directly to the inner approximation .",
    "this is because the condition @xmath141 must be applied at @xmath142 , a point that is very clearly in the exterior and _ not _ in the interior region . as a result",
    ", the inner approximation will contain ambiguous constants of integration .",
    "fortunately , this ambiguity can be lifted by matching the inner and outer approximations to @xmath26 if there exists some _ intermediate region _ where both approximations are simultaneously valid .",
    "this matching of the inner approximation to the outer one is referred to as the method of matched asymptotic expansions ( maes ) .",
    "it relies on the fact that , in any given region , the asymptotic expansion of a quantity is unique ( for a proof see * ? ? ?",
    "thus if the inner and outer approximations of @xmath26 are both valid in the intermediate region , they must be equal in that region . for the method of mae to be applicable we must , of course , require that an intermediate region exists .",
    "a necessary condition for an intermediate region to exist is that for some range of @xmath57 : @xmath143 this becomes a necessary and sufficient condition if the only boundary of the interior region is in the exterior one , and vice versa ( see figure [ figillu ] for an illustration ) . if the scale of the inhomogeneity , @xmath144 , is taken to be the largest value of @xmath57 for which @xmath145 , and then then an intermediate region generally exists provided that @xmath146 .    in resume , in this section we have considered spherically symmetric backgrounds and far from black hole horizons .",
    "we have basically performed an expansion in the newtonian potential at leading order , at least as far as the evolution of scalar field perturbations are concerned .",
    "notice , however , that this method can be straightforwardly extended to allow for deviations from spherical symmetry @xcite .    to be clear , we should point out that the expansion in @xmath130 and @xmath131 , which is a lot like expanding in the newtonian potential , is not really the key to our method .",
    "that is just a simplification .",
    "the key is that we take : @xmath147 in the interior region and @xmath33 in the exterior region .",
    "that is , everything is linear in those two regions .",
    "we then assume that there is an intermediate region where both of these conditions hold . which implies that in the intermediate region : @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "so the assumption that @xmath150 everywhere ensures that we have an intermediate region .",
    "we could in fact relax this but the calculations would become more difficult : often still doable , but in almost all physically interesting cases totally unnecessary .",
    "for instance the relaxation to @xmath151 and @xmath152 , is very straightforward and allows one to go all the way up to a black hole horizon @xcite .",
    "in this section we find an asymptotic approximation to the dde density contrast , @xmath4 .",
    "the discussion is fairly technical , and readers more interested in the results than the machinery used to derive them may prefer to focus on the statement , discussion and application of our results in section [ sec : evo : dis ] and following .",
    "the dde is described by the field @xmath26 which satisfies : @xmath153 we solve this equation by constructing an asymptotic approximation to @xmath26 in the small parameter @xmath154 .",
    "we write : @xmath155 where @xmath156 . before solving for @xmath26",
    ", we make the dependence of the metric on @xmath154 explicit by transforming to a new radial coordinate , @xmath157 , where @xmath106 is the scale factor of the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmological background . in @xmath158",
    "coordinates the metric is : @xmath159 consider @xmath160 in this metric : @xmath161 where @xmath162 is evaluated at constant @xmath86 as opposed to constant @xmath8 or @xmath57 and is thus given by eq .",
    "( [ treqn ] ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath163 satisfies : @xmath164 we now solve for @xmath163 in both the interior and exterior regions .",
    "we note that @xmath165 , and that @xmath166 , so that @xmath167 in many cases @xmath163 is small enough so that @xmath168 and @xmath169 so that @xmath96 evolves over cosmological time - scales . in these cases",
    "it is clear that : @xmath170 and so this term can be dropped at leading order . although it will often be the case that @xmath171 we do not have to require such a strong assumption in order to justify ignoring the effect of the potential to leading order in the interior approximation .",
    "instead , we make the far weaker assumption that : @xmath172 a physically - viable dde theory for which this requirement does not hold would be difficult to construct . for instance , if this condition did not hold then even if , at one instant , @xmath173 or smaller , as must be required for @xmath174 to evolve over cosmological time scales , shortly afterwards small changes in @xmath175 would cause @xmath176 to grow to be many orders of magnitude greater than @xmath177 .",
    "this would result in @xmath175 evolving over time - scales that are much shorter than the hubble time .",
    "the only dde theories that we can imagine that could accommodate this and still be compatible with observations would involve @xmath26 being held almost completely fixed at a minimum of @xmath178 , in which case the dde would be almost entirely indistinguishable from a cosmological constant .    to leading order in the interior , we would actually be justified in setting @xmath179 as @xmath180 . however , since it might not be completely clear that these terms may be ignored , and because we can solve the @xmath163 equation without having to ignore them , we continue to include them .",

    "we assume that there exists some @xmath190 , in the interior region , such that for @xmath191 in the interior region , @xmath154 decreases faster than @xmath192 as @xmath103 ; @xmath193 then decreases faster than @xmath194 for @xmath191 .",

    "our key assumption in deriving our formula for @xmath4 was that the matter density contrast is only @xmath530 or greater on scales that are small compared to the hubble length , @xmath45 .",

    "we also made a number of simplifying assumptions :    * we assumed spherical symmetry .",
    "although our interest is in dark energy rather than varying - constants , the sub - horizon dynamics of perturbations in the dde scalar field are very similar to those of the scalar fields in varying - constant models provided one sets the matter coupling in such theories to zero .",
    "@xcite studied the evolution of a light scalar field in an inhomogeneous background in the context of varying - constant . both spherically symmetric backgrounds and ones without any symmetries were considered , and it was found that deviations from spherically symmetry did not alter the leading order behaviour of the scalar field perturbations when the matter coupling vanishes .",
    "therefore , whilst the assumption of spherical symmetry can be relaxed , we do not expect it to greatly alter our results .",
    "* we assumed that we were not near a black hole horizon .",
    "this assumption allowed us to take @xmath44 on sub - horizon scales .",

    "moreover since we have require @xmath668 and in most quintessence models @xmath669 , it is for most models generally true that @xmath670 .",
    "if @xmath671 or larger , then we expect that it will result in a smaller dde density contrast , i.e. smaller values of @xmath672 .",
    "one of the main motivations for this work was the recent work of @xcite .",
    "they studied the clustering of a subclass of the dde models which we have looked at in this work .",
    "they numerically evolved the linearized field equations for both @xmath26 and the metric . in the regime",
    "where the linearized equations are valid ( i.e. @xmath49 ) , our analytical results agree with theirs : shortly after the collapse begins , @xmath397 is positive , but then as the dying mode of an overdensity of matter becomes small , @xmath397 changes sign and becomes negative . at late times in the linear regime",
    "an overdensity of matter corresponds to a dde void , and vice versa .",
    "we saw in this paper that this correspondence continues to hold in the quasi - linear regime , @xmath673 , that is appropriate for superclusters and voids of matter .",
    "when @xmath665 , dutta and maor found that @xmath672 could grow to be relatively large ( of the order of @xmath674 ) , and that this could lead to corrections to the equation of state parameter , @xmath20 , of the order of a few percent .",
    "however , as we noted in the introduction , the @xmath530 values of @xmath25 for which this effect was found fall outside the regime where the linearized field equations which they used are actually valid . one should point out however , that in a matter dominated universe ( @xmath675 ) , there is a clear mapping between the the linear regime of an overdensity and the exact fully developed non- linear overdensity .",
    "presumably , such mapping should occur also in the presence of a scalar field , though the multiple change of sign of the dde perturbation complicate things considerably and this relation is not straight forward .",
    "we also saw that at late times in the linear and quasi - linear regimes @xmath337 grows faster than @xmath391 .",
    "if it were not for the onset of truly non - linear behaviour in the evolution of @xmath25 , this would indeed lead to large values of @xmath343 seen at late times by @xcite .    in our study",
    "we found that @xmath397 for realistic astrophysical objects is very small , indeed it is generally @xmath676 . the fast growth in @xmath4 seen by @xcite for @xmath665 should therefore been interpreted as resulting from applying linearized field equations outside their realm of validity , rather than a true physical effect .",
    "furthermore , at very late times when the matter perturbation has virialised and accretion onto the core has all but ceased , we found that @xmath519 , and that @xmath677 , where @xmath190 is the smallest radius for which @xmath250 decreases as quickly as @xmath678 , @xmath679 is the mass inside @xmath190 .",
    "whilst it is possible with highly non - linear potentials , in general it seems improbably that @xmath680 values of @xmath4 , which in turn result in order @xmath680 values for @xmath681 will result in any pronounced non - linear effects especially over sub horizon scales .",
    "it is fair to say though that the conditions might be on the brink of breaking down for a @xmath682 mpc void , since @xmath683 .",
    "but for smaller objects provided the conditions we place on the potential hold ( which essentially preclude small changes in @xmath26 from resulting in huge changes in @xmath684 , @xmath685 or @xmath686 ) then there is no particular reason to think that perturbations in @xmath20 will result in @xmath687 or greater corrections to @xmath4 .",
    "one should also point out that in the case where the scalar field is strongly coupled to matter ( e.g. as in @xcite ) , then the dark energy perturbations might not be small . since it is natural to expect that when matter starts to infall into the nonlinear regime it will drag along the dark energy field .",
    "we also used our analytical expression for @xmath397 to calculate the integrated sachs wolfe ( isw ) induced by the dde density perturbations .",
    "we found that the isw due to the dde perturbations is always much smaller than the isw effect due to the matter perturbation in these dde models by a factor of roughly @xmath688 . indeed ,",
    "even the isw effect due to the clustering of dde near an extremely large @xmath646 is found to result in a temperature anisotropy no larger than @xmath689 . for smaller objects the isw effect due to dde clustering scales as @xmath652 ( where @xmath551 is the radius of the cluster ) .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that , if dark energy is described by a simple uncoupled quintessence theory , dde perturbations will be detected through the isw effect .    in summary :",
    "we have derived an analytical expression for the dde density contrast in uncoupled quintessence models and used it to make quantitative predictions for dde clustering .",
    "our results should also apply to fields with very weak matter coupling .",
    "this analysis could also be straightforwardly extended to models that are coupled to matter but we leave this to a later work .",
    "if the mass of the scalar in these models is @xmath690 , then @xmath397 is , to leading order , independent of the specifics of the underlying theory .",
    "as opposed to what has been suggested elsewhere , we found that @xmath397 is always small compared to the matter density contrast , and that even when the matter perturbation goes non - linear , @xmath397 remains @xmath691 for typical astrophysical objects . if we define the radius , @xmath551 , of a matter over / under - density by the condition that at @xmath485 , the mean matter density contrast drops off like @xmath192 , then we found that @xmath692 .",
    "dde clustering could potentially be detected through the isw effect or measurements of the peculiar velocity field of matter .",
    "roughly , the magnitude of the dde clustering contribution to these effects is a factor @xmath693 times the contribution from the clustering of ordinary matter . for realistic astrophysical objects , we found that voids and super - voids correspond to local overdensities in dark energy , with @xmath0 for clusters and average voids , and @xmath1 for super - voids .",
    "if voids with radii of @xmath3 exist within the visible universe then @xmath4 may be as large as @xmath5 .",
    "linear overdensities of matter and super - clusters generally correspond to local voids in dark energy ; for a typical super - cluster : @xmath6 .",
    "astronomical observations indicate @xmath694 for @xmath695 , and so we conclude that if dark energy is described by an uncoupled quintessence model , then today dark energy is almost homogeneous on sub - horizon scales with perturbations generally of order of @xmath696 ; the largest perturbations will be @xmath697 and associated with very large voids of matter .",
