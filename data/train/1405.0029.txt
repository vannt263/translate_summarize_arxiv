    "interference is a fundamental bottleneck in wireless communication networks whose spectrum is shared among multiple users .",
    "unmanaged interference results in diminishing data rates in wireless networks . with a recently developed network coding strategy , however , it was demonstrated that interference is no longer adverse in communication networks , provided that it can sagaciously be harnessed .",
    "this approach of exploiting interference has opened the possibility of better performance in the interference - limited communication regime than was previously thought possible .",
    "for example , in multi - hop wired networks , it was shown that a network coding strategy achieves the capacity of the multicast network @xcite . physical layer ( analog ) network coding @xcite provides a generalization of network coding to wireless networks . in certain topologies",
    ", it was shown that physical layer network coding can achieve higher rates over routing - based strategies .    in this paper",
    ", we advance the idea of interference exploitation .",
    "the prior physical - layer network coding approaches exploit the self - interference signal as the main source of side - information .",
    "we introduce a new physical - layer network coding strategy , which exploits overheard interference signals as side - information in addition to self - interference signals for fully - connected multi - way relay networks",
    ".    * related work : * multi - way communication using intermediate relay nodes is found in cellular networks , sensor networks , and device - to - device ( d2d ) communication . the simplest multi - way relay network model is the two - way relay channel @xcite where a pair of users wish to exchange messages by sharing a single relay .",
    "although the capacity of this simple channel is still unknown in general @xcite , physical layer network coding @xcite and analog network coding @xcite are key techniques for showing how to improve the sum - rates of two - way relay channels by allowing users to exploit their transmit signal as side - information .",
    "the two - way relay channel has been generalized in a number of ways to consider multiple users @xcite and multiple directional information exchange @xcite .",
    "for example , for the multi - pair two - way relay channel where multiple user pairs exchange messages with their partners by sharing a common relay , the capacity of multi - pair two - way relay network was characterized for a deterministic and gaussian channel model in @xcite .",
    "for the multi - user multi - way relay channel with unicast messages exchange , the multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) y channel was introduced in @xcite where three users exchange independent unicast messages with each other via an intermediate relay .",
    "the key to deriving the degrees of freedom ( dof ) of the mimo y channel was the idea of _ signal space alignment for network coding_. subsequently , this idea was applied to characterize the the sum - dof of a @xmath0-user y channel @xcite and multi - way mimo relay channel with asymmetric antennas @xcite , mixed ( unicast and multicast ) information flows @xcite , and direct links between users @xcite .",
    "the main limitation of the aforementioned studies on multi - way relay channels @xcite is that they rely layered network connectivity that ignores direct links among users .",
    "for example , in the two - way relay channel @xcite-@xcite , it was assumed that users can not communicate with each other without using a relay between them because they are very far apart . due to the broadcast nature of the wireless medium and the mobility of users ,",
    "however , it is possible that a wireless node is able to listen to the other node s transmission through a direct path ; thereby all nodes in the network can be directly connected with each other .",
    "this motivates us to consider a fully - connected multi - way relay network in which @xmath0 users with a single antenna exchange unicast messages with each other via @xmath1 relays ; each of them has @xmath2 antennas for @xmath3 .",
    "* contribution : * the completely - connected property of the multi - way relay networks brings a new challenge in managing interference . when networks are fully - connected , a node receives signals arriving from different paths , which creates a more sophisticated interference management problems than those of partially connected networks . to overcome this challenge",
    ", we propose a new interference management approach inspired by physical - layer network coding , called space - time physical layer network coding ( st - pnc ) .",
    "st - pnc involves two key steps : 1 ) side - information learning and 2 ) space - time relay transmission .",
    "in the first phase of side - information learning , subsets of users in the network spread out information symbols in the network over multiple time slots .",
    "then , the non - transmitting nodes in the network overhear the information symbols sent by the multiple transmitting nodes and store linear combinations of them to exploit later in decoding . in the second phase , relays send out the superposition of obtained symbols using space - time precoding over multiple channel uses .",
    "the core concept of space - time precoding at the relays is to effectively control the multi - directional information flows so that all users can exploit their side - information : i ) what they sent and ii ) what they overheard in the phase of side - information learning .",
    "we explain the concept of st - pnc using two simple fully - connected multi - way relay networks . in those networks",
    ", it was shown that st - pnc provides increased sum - dof of the networks compared to a relay - aided multi - user precoding technique @xcite and interference alignment @xcite . from this result",
    ", we verify the intuition that efficiently harnessing both transmitted and overheard signals as side - information brings significant performance improvements to fully - connected multi - way relay networks .",
    "then , applying st - pnc and relay - aided interference alignment @xcite , we establish an inner bound of the sum - dof for the @xmath0-user fully - connected multi - way relay network with @xmath1 relays , each with one or more antennas . one interesting observation obtained from this sum - dof characterization",
    "is that if there are not enough antennas at the relays in the multi - way relay network , then the one - way communication protocol method using relay - aided interference alignment achieves a better sum - dof of the network .",
    "whereas , when the number of antennas at the relays are enough to control multi - directional information flows , the multi - way communication protocol using the proposed st - pnc outperforms than the existing interference management techniques . leveraging the cut - set outer bound result in @xcite , we provide a sufficient condition of relays antenna configurations for obtaining the optimal sum - dof of the network .",
    "further , by comparing with a generalization of orthogonalize - and - forward method in @xcite , we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed st - pnc in terms of the sum - dof .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , a general system model of the fully - connected multi - way relay network is described .",

    "<S> a space - time physical - layer network coding ( st - pnc ) method is presented for information exchange among multiple users over fully - connected multi - way relay networks . </S>",
    "<S> the method involves two steps : i ) side - information learning and ii ) space - time relay transmission . in the first step , </S>",
    "<S> different sets of users are scheduled to send signals over networks and the remaining users and relays overhear the transmitted signals , thereby learning the interference patterns . in the second step , </S>",
    "<S> multiple relays cooperatively send out linear combinations of signals received in the previous phase using space - time precoding so that all users efficiently exploit their side - information in the form of : 1 ) what they sent and 2 ) what they overheard in decoding . </S>",
    "<S> this coding concept is illustrated through two simple network examples . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that st - pnc improves the sum of degrees of freedom ( sum - dof ) of the network compared to existing interference management methods . </S>",
    "<S> with st - pnc , the sum - dof of a general multi - way relay network without channel knowledge at the users is characterized in terms of relevant system parameters , chiefly the number of users , the number of relays , and the number of antennas at relays . </S>",
    "<S> a major implication of the derived results is that efficiently harnessing both transmitted and overheard signals as side - information brings significant performance improvements to fully - connected multi - way relay networks . </S>"
