    "the mathematical and computational study of inverse coefficient problems to the radiative transport equations have attracted extensive attentions in recent years ; see for instance the reviews  @xcite and references therein .",
    "the main objective of these inverse problems is to reconstruct physical parameters in the radiative transport equation from partial information on the solution to the equation .",
    "these inverse problems have important applications in many areas of science and engineering , such as ocean , atmospheric and interstellar optics  @xcite , radiation therapy planning  @xcite , diffuse optical tomography and quantitative photoacoustic tomography  @xcite , molecular imaging  @xcite and many more  @xcite .",
    "we consider here the application of inverse transport problems in biomedical optical imaging techniques such as diffuse optical tomography ( dot )  @xcite and fluorescence optical tomography ( fot )  @xcite where radiative transport equations are often employed as the model for light propagation in biological tissues . to setup the problem ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) the tissue of interest , with sufficiently regular surface @xmath2 .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 the unit sphere in @xmath4 , and @xmath5 the unit vector on the sphere .",
    "we denote by @xmath6 the phase space and define the boundary sets of the phase space , @xmath7 , as @xmath8 with @xmath9 the unit outer normal vector at @xmath10 .",
    "the radiative transport equation for the phase - space density distribution of the photons in the tissue can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the density of photons at @xmath13 traveling in direction @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the light source .",
    "the positive functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the absorption coefficient and the scattering coefficients respectively .",
    "the total absorption coefficient is given by @xmath18 .",
    "the scattering operator @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 where the scattering kernel @xmath21 describes the probability that photons traveling in direction @xmath22 getting scattered into direction @xmath14 .",
    "note that to conserve the total mass , we have normalized the surface measure @xmath23 on @xmath3 and the scattering kernel @xmath21 such that @xmath24 in biomedical optics , the scattering kernel is often taken as the henyey - greenstein phase function  @xcite : @xmath25 which is a one - parameter function that depends only on the angle between the two directions @xmath14 and @xmath22 for a given anisotropy factor @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath27 is determined by the normalization condition  .",
    "the function @xmath28 models the illumination source used in imaging experiments . in practical application of biomedical imaging , for instance in dot and fot ,",
    "it is often technically difficult to construct angularly - resolved illumination sources .",
    "this is the main reason for us to employ an isotropic source function ( referring to the fact that @xmath28 does not depend on the angular variable @xmath14 ) in the the transport model  .",
    "the measured data in biomedical optical imaging is usually a functional of the solution to the transport equation . once again , due to the fact that it is difficult to measure angularly - resolved quantities , angularly - averaged quantities are usually measured .",
    "here we consider applications ( for instance dot and fot ) where the measurement is the photon current on the surface of the tissue .",
    "the current is defined as @xmath29 the objective of the biomedical imaging problems here is to reconstruct the optical absorption and scattering coefficients of biological tissues , @xmath30 and @xmath31 from data encoded in the albedo operator : @xmath32    there are two major issues with diffuse optical imaging .",
    "the first issue is its low resolution due to the multiple scattering of light in tissues .",
    "mathematically , this is manifested as the instability of the inverse transport problem  @xcite . by instability",
    "we mean that the noise in the data are significantly amplified in the inversion process , assuming that the problem admits a unique solution to start with . to stabilize the inverse problem , one can incorporate additional _ a priori _ information into the computational inversion algorithms .",
    "commonly - used _ a priori _ information including , for instance , the smoothness or non - smoothness of the unknown  @xcite and the shape of the regions of interests  @xcite .",
    "the second issue with diffuse optical tomography is that there is no analytical inversion formulas for the image reconstruction problem , even in very academic geometrical configuration  @xcite .",
    "computational reconstruction algorithms based on the radiative transport model are in general extremely slow .",
    "fast reconstruction algorithms are actively sought by researchers in the field .",
    "the instability of the inverse transport problems implies that when there is no available _ a priori _ information , only low - frequency components of the unknowns can be reconstructed stably .",
    "one should thus not spend too much efforts trying to reconstruct high - frequency components of the unknowns .",
    "based on this observation and the idea of subspace minimization  @xcite , we propose here a fast computational reconstruction method for the aforementioned inverse transport problems .",
    "our method relies on the fact that we can explicitly factorize out some unstable components of the albedo operator @xmath33 defined in  .",
    "the unstable components of the albedo operator then impose a natural limit on the highest - frequency components of the unknown that can be reconstructed stably from the data .",
    "the factorization of @xmath33 is not unique in general . for our purpose",
    ", we follow the ideas in  @xcite to reformulate the transport problem into the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an operator that _ does not depend on the unknowns _ , and @xmath36 is an operator that only depends on the unknowns .",
    "the intermediate quantity @xmath37 can be either the transport solution @xmath38 , or a functional of it , or a functional of both @xmath38 and the unknown coefficient , depending on the setup of the inverse problem .",
    "we will focus on the derivation of this formulation in the next two sections .",
    "once the forward problem is put into this form , we can split the inverse problem into two steps . in the first step , we `` invert '' the first equation to find @xmath37 while in the second step , we `` invert '' from @xmath37 the unknown coefficients . by construction",
    ", @xmath35 can not be inverted or not stably inverted .",
    "this means that there are many small or even zero singular values of @xmath35 .",
    "noise in the data can easily ruin the reconstruction of @xmath37 on these components of the small singular values .",
    "we thus split the eigenspace of @xmath35 into two subspaces , one spanned by eigenvectors corresponding to large singular values @xmath39 ( say @xmath40 ) that we call signal subspace , and the other spanned by eigenvectors corresponding to small singular values ( @xmath41 ) that we call noise subspace , following terminologies in  @xcite . the unknown coefficient functions and the intermediate quantity @xmath37 can be then be written as summations of two components that correspond to their projections into the two subspaces .",
    "this explicit splitting allows us to focus on the components of the unknowns corresponding to signal subspace while pay less attention to , and sometimes completely throw away , the components corresponding to noise subspace .",
    "the price we have to pay is that we have to be able to construct the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of the operator @xmath35 in a computationally inexpensive way so that the whole algorithm is computationally feasible . indeed , as we will see later , due to the fact that @xmath35 is independent of the unknowns , the svd of @xmath35 can be pre - computed and do _ not _ need to be updated in the nonlinear minimization process .",
    "this is the main reason why the reconstruction algorithm can be efficient .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : cont form ] , we reformulate , on continuous level , the radiative transport equation into the form of system   and   for both the reconstruction of the absorption coefficient and the reconstruction of the scattering coefficient .",
    "we then present in section  [ sec : disc form ] the discretization of the continuous formulations .",
    "the details of our subspace - based minimization algorithm is then presented in section  [ sec : som ] with some numerical experiments to demonstrate its performance in section  [ sec : num ] .",
    "concluding remarks are then offered in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "it is well - known in inverse transport theory that with the types of data encoded in the albedo operator @xmath33 defined in  , only one of the two optical coefficients can be uniquely reconstructed  @xcite when no further information are available .",
    "we will thus work on the reconstruction of one coefficient assuming that the other is known .",
    "let us first consider the case of reconstructing the absorption coefficient @xmath30 assuming that the scattering coefficient @xmath31 is known .",
    "we first introduce the adjoint boundary green function @xmath42 as the solution of the following adjoint free transport equation : @xmath43 thus @xmath42 is the solution of the adjoint transport problem with an isotropic point source on the outgoing boundary @xmath44 . later on in this paper , @xmath45 is considered as the location of the detector used to measure the current data @xmath46 .",
    "we now multiply   by @xmath42 , subtract it by the multiplication of   and @xmath12 , and then integrate over phase space @xmath47 , we have @xmath48 the left hand side can be simplified using integration - by - part .",
    "we find , after splitting the boundary integral into an integral on @xmath49 and another integral on @xmath44 , that @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the surface measure on @xmath2 .",
    "we combine   and   to obtain @xmath52    let us now introduce the adjoint volume green function @xmath53 as the solution of the following adjoint free transport equation : @xmath54 if we multiply   by @xmath53 , subtract it by the multiplication of   and @xmath12 , and then integrate over phase space @xmath47 , we have @xmath55    it turns out that we can rearrange equations   and   into the form of the system   and   after introducing an intermediate variable . to do that ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath56 a smooth extension of @xmath15 ( which does exist ; see for instance  @xcite for justifications ) , and @xmath57 a smooth extension of the vector @xmath58 in the neighborhood of @xmath2 .",
    "we define @xmath59 then we can rewrite   as : @xmath60 and   as @xmath61 using  , we can rewrite   as : @xmath62 equations   and   then form a system of exactly the same form as system   and  .",
    "this is the foundation of the algorithm that we will develop later .",
    "note that the intermediate variable @xmath37 that we introduced here is a functional of both the unknown coefficient @xmath30 to be reconstructed and the solution @xmath38 of the radiative transport equation with this coefficient .",
    "we now assume that the absorption coefficient @xmath16 is known and we intend to reconstruct the scattering coefficient @xmath17 . in this case , the adjoint boundary green function @xmath63 that we need solves the following transport equation @xmath64 following the same procedure as before , we multiply   by @xmath65 , subtract it by the multiplication of   and @xmath12 , and then integrate over phase space @xmath47 , we have @xmath66 an integration - by - part on the left hand side then leads to @xmath67 we now define @xmath68 which then enabless us to rewrite   as @xmath69    to derive the equation for @xmath37 , we introduce the volume adjoint green function @xmath70 as the solution to the adjoint transport equation : @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "this green function allows us to derive the following result , following exactly the same procedure as before : @xmath73 plugging   into  , we can obtain the state equation : @xmath74    equations   and   then form a system of exactly the same form as the system of   and  . as in the previous case ,",
    "the intermediate variable @xmath37 that we introduced here is a functional of both the unknown coefficient @xmath31 to be reconstructed and the solution @xmath38 of the radiative transport equation with this coefficient .",
    "let us mention that the idea of splitting of streaming ( including the absorption ) with the rest of the operator has been explored by bal and monard in  @xcite where they constructed an accurate solver for the streaming operator based on numerical rotations",
    ".      the formulation we presented above can be easily generalized to the case when the measured data take another form .",
    "one typical type of data assumed in the literature is given as , see for instance  @xcite , @xmath75 in this case , we follow exactly the same procedures as before to get the formulation   and  , and   and  .",
    "the only change needed would be to replace the @xmath76 terms in the equations for the boundary adjoint green functions @xmath77 and @xmath78 , i.e   and  , with @xmath79 .",
    "the same idea apply to the cases where the illumination source is angularly resolved , assuming it can be constructed .",
    "we remark , however , that when data encoded in measurements of the form   or in illumination of the form @xmath80 are available for , the inverse problem can be less ill - posed or even well - posed ; see for instance  @xcite and references therein . in practice , however , one can access only a very limited number of directions .",
    "inverse problems in these settings can still be very ill - posed and the method we propose in section  [ sec : som ] are still useful there .",
    "we now construct the discrete version of the system   and  .",
    "to do that , we need to discretize the radiative transport equation . due to the fact that the unknown @xmath38 is posed in phase space , we need to discretize in both spatial and angular variables .",
    "there are many existing methods to perform such a discretization , see for instance  @xcite and references therein .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a first - order finite - volume discrete - ordinate discretization that we proposed in our earlier work  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the spatial domain of interest , @xmath81 , is discretized into a total number of @xmath82 finite volume cells that centered at @xmath83 respectively . the angular domain , @xmath3 is discretized into @xmath84 directions @xmath85 .",
    "the discrete ordinates method approximate the integral on the sphere @xmath3 with the following quadrature rule @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the quadrature weight associated with direction @xmath88 .",
    "following the same spirit , the scattering term @xmath89 is approximated by : @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "the normalization conditions , which are necessary to ensure the conservation of photons , take the following forms in discrete case : @xmath92    in a first - order cell - centered finite - volume discretization , we approximate the spatial integration by : @xmath93 where @xmath94 represents the volume of the @xmath95-th finite volume whose center is @xmath96 .    in the presentation",
    "below , we assume that we have @xmath97 detectors in the setup , with the location of the @xmath98-th detector denoted by @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "the data we measured are collected in the data vector @xmath101 : @xmath102 where @xmath103 .      with the discretization method introduced above ,",
    "we get the discretized form field equation   as : @xmath104 we then collect this datum for all detectors to have the following system @xmath105 where @xmath106 represents the direct product of two matrices .",
    "the vector @xmath107 contains the discrete values of @xmath108 and is arranged as : @xmath109 where the superscript @xmath110 is used to denote the transpose operation .",
    "the matrix @xmath111 , coming from the green function , takes the form @xmath112 this means that the elements of the matrix @xmath113 are @xmath114 the diagonal matrices @xmath115 and @xmath116 are defined respectively as @xmath117    similarly , the discretized version of the state equation given by   is : @xmath118 where @xmath119 , @xmath120",
    ". we can write it in vector form as @xmath121 where @xmath122 is a matrix contains the discretized scattering kernel , with elements @xmath123 and @xmath124 denotes the identity matrix .",

    "can also be used to recover the unknown scattering coefficient if the absorption coefficient is known .      using the same discretization as in the previous section",
    ", we can transform the field equation   into the discretized form : @xmath137 we then collect this datum for all detectors to arrive at the following algebraic system : @xmath138 where @xmath139 has the same format as @xmath140 defined in  , while @xmath141 and @xmath142 are given in  .",
    "the discretized version of the state equation   can now be written as , @xmath119 ,  @xmath120 : @xmath143 in matrix form , this is : @xmath144 where @xmath145 , @xmath136 are defined as before .",
    "the matrix @xmath146 has exactly the same structure as the matrix @xmath147 .",
    "the two algebraic systems   and   are in the form of   and   if we define @xmath148 note that the matrix @xmath134 in this case depends only on the scattering coefficient ( @xmath149 , i.e. , the discretized form of @xmath31 ) that we are interested in reconstructing .",
    "it does not depend on the absorption coefficient .",
    "this is different from the matrix @xmath134 we introduced in  .",
    "we remark finally that even though the discretized formulation in this section is based on a first - order finite - volume discrete - ordinate method for the radiative transport equation , the reconstruction method we introduce in next section is not limited to this discretization .",
    "let us recall that to solve the inverse problem of reconstructing the optical parameters , the data we are given are encoded in the map @xmath33 .",
    "this means that for each illumination source @xmath15 , we have the corresponding current data @xmath150 . in practice , we have a finite number , say @xmath151 , of sources to use .",
    "the total data available to us are thus : @xmath152 where @xmath153 denote the quantity @xmath154 associated with source @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "the construction in the previous sections can thus be conducted for data collected from each illumination source .",
    "we have the following system of equations : @xmath157 it is critical to realize that both matrix @xmath158 and matrix @xmath134 are independent of the illuminations ( i.e. independent of the index @xmath155 ) .",
    "otherwise the computation will be very expensive as we will need to compute the svd of @xmath158 .",
    "let us first briefly recall the singular value decomposition of a non - symmetric matrix @xmath159 .",
    "we denote by @xmath160 the singular values , arranged in nonincreasing order @xmath161 , where it is assumed that there are a total number of @xmath162 large singular values .",

    "the singular value decomposition of @xmath158 can then be represented as : @xmath171 the matrix @xmath172 $ ] consists of the left singular vectors and the matrix @xmath173 $ ] consists of the right singular vectors .",
    "the diagonal of the rectangular diagonal matrix @xmath174 contain the singular values .",
    "due to the instability of inverse transport problems , the matrix @xmath158 defined in   has many small ( and zero when @xmath158 is not invertible ) singular values .",
    "high - frequency noise in the data @xmath175 can easily ruin the reconstruction of @xmath176 ( @xmath156 ) through these small singular values .",
    "the resolution in the reconstruction of the coefficients is thus limited by the smallest singular value , which we denote by @xmath177 , that is not significantly ruined by noise .",
    "we assume that there are @xmath162 large ( i.e. @xmath178 ) singular values , i.e. @xmath179 .",
    "we decompose the matrix @xmath180 into @xmath181 $ ] where @xmath182 and @xmath183 are matrices that contain the first @xmath162 and the last @xmath184 columns of @xmath180 respectively",
    ". then @xmath182 and @xmath183 decompose the column space of @xmath180 into two subspaces : the signal subspace and the noise subspace , following the terminologies in  @xcite .",

    ", @xmath187 is the orthogonal complement of @xmath188 and vice versa .",
    "now for any known vector @xmath176 as a solution to the system   and  , we can decompose it into a summation of its projection to the signal subspace , @xmath189 , and its projection to the noise subspace , @xmath190 : @xmath191 where @xmath192 and @xmath193 are the corresponding coefficient vectors for the projections , with @xmath194 ( @xmath195 ) .      to solve the inverse transport problems to find the optical coefficients , we first need to propagate information contained in the current data @xmath175 @xmath196 to the intermediate quantity , @xmath176 , by `` solving '' the equation  .",
    "due to the the existence of small singular values ( @xmath197 ) for the discrete operator @xmath158 , the high - frequency components of @xmath176 , i.e. , the components in the noise subspace , can not be stably reconstructed in the inversion process without additional _ a priori _ information .",

    "moreover , we do not need to store the whole matrix @xmath158 but only the first @xmath97 left and right singular vectors .    in practical applications of optical imaging ,",

    "when there is no obvious jump of singular values of @xmath158 , @xmath162 should be selected mainly according to the noise level in the data .",
    "our principle is to look at the project of the data @xmath241 on @xmath242 .",

    "the `` measurements '' that we use in the reconstructions are synthetic data that are generated by solving the radiative transport equation for _ known _ optical coefficients .",
    "to reduce the degree of `` inverse crimes '' , we use two different sets of finite volume meshes when generating the synthetic data and when performing the numerical reconstructions . in general , the meshes for generating data are twice as fine as the meshes used in the inversion . for the noisy data , we added multiplicative random noise to the data by simply multiplying each datum by @xmath245 ` random ` ) with ` random ` a uniform random variable taking values in @xmath246 $ ] , @xmath247 being the noise level in percentage . in each case",

    ", our method will out - perform traditional methods since we only construct one svd and use it for the rest of reconstructions .",
    "to summarize , we proposed in this work a subspace - based minimization reconstruction strategy for solving inverse coefficient problems for the radiative transport equation , for applications in optical imaging techniques such as diffuse optical tomography . in this strategy , we factorize the map from the unknown coefficient to the observed data into the composition of a map from the coefficient to an intermediate variable ( which is also unknown ) with a map from the intermediate variable to the data .",
    "we then perform a spectral decomposition ( svd ) of the second map which enable us to decompose the intermediate variable into a low - frequency part , which can be stably reconstructed , and a high - frequency part , which can not be stably reconstructed due to noise in the data . in the reconstruction , we reconstruct the low - frequency component of the intermediate variable analytically and the high - frequency component with an inexpensive minimization algorithm .",
    "we then reconstruct the coefficient by inverting the map from the coefficient to the intermediate variable using another inexpensive minimization algorithm .",
    "numerical simulation results based on synthetic data demonstrated that this reconstruction strategy can be efficient and robust once the computationally expensive spectral decomposition have been computed off - line .",
    "even though we use the terminology `` subspace - based minimization '' following the work of chen and collaborators  @xcite , there are several critical differences between our strategy and these in  @xcite as we have emphasized in the presentation of section  [ sec : som ] .",
    "the main difference is the reduction of unknowns in the reconstruction following the philosophy in one of our previous work  @xcite .",
    "in fact , it would be very interesting to combine the current algorithm , in which the intermediate variable is parameterized , with the algorithm in  @xcite , in which the unknown coefficient is parameterized .",
    "there are also strong connections , in terms of algorithm philosophy , between our algorithm , the algorithms based on optimal grid and networks  @xcite in which the measurement setup of the problem is used to determine an optimal parameterization of the unknowns for the reconstruction algorithm , and the algorithms based on sparsity  @xcite .",
    "essentially , all the aforementioned strategies share the same philosophy , that is , for these severely ill - conditioned inverse problems , only low - frequency contents in the unknowns can be stably reconstructed when no extra _ a priori _ information are available .",
    "it is thus more efficient to simply attempt to reconstruct these low - frequency contents parameterized under a good basis .",
    "the difference between the algorithms lies in their strategies to obtain that good basis .",
