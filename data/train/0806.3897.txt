    "membranes are essential components of all biological cells @xcite .",
    "in addition to their biological importance , lipid bilayers and biomembranes have also attracted considerable attention from physicists due to their fascinating and unusual properties @xcite .",
    "one particularly well studied system is the human red blood cell ( rbc ) membrane .",
    "the rbc membrane is a composite structure , consisting of a lipid bilayer adhered to an underlying network of filamentous cytoskeletal proteins ( spectrin ) via integral membrane protein anchors ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mesh ] ) .",
    "the spectrin network is observed to be quite regular @xcite , with an approximate hexagonal symmetry extending over the entire cell surface .",
    "( it is worth emphasizing that the spectrin based cytoskeletal network of rbcs is completely different from the three dimensional actin networks common to other types of animal cells @xcite . )",
    "given the apparent simplicity of the rbc membrane , it is tempting to attempt modeling with elementary elastic models .",
    "indeed , there is a rich history of elastic rbc models to be found in the literature @xcite . without attempting a full historical review here ,",
    "we comment that no single elastic model has yet been identified that is capable of reproducing the full set of experimental data available for rbc membranes . for example , while the work of lim , wortis and mukhopadhyay @xcite is capable of capturing the range of observed rbc shapes ( stomatocyte , discocyte , echinocyte and non - main - sequence shapes as well ) seen under various chemically induced stresses ( e.g. ph , salt , atp , etc . ) , this model has not been applied to explain the thermal fluctuation amplitudes observed in rbc membranes . and , while the models of gov , zilman and safran @xcite and fournier , lacoste and raphael @xcite appear to do a good job fitting thermal fluctuation data @xcite , these models do not appear capable of explaining mechanical deformation experiments on rbcs @xcite .",
    "the failure of simple models to consistently explain both thermal fluctuations and mechanical deformation experiments has been recognized for years @xcite .",
    "one recent model does explain both types of data within a single elastic model @xcite , however this model treats the spectrin network as an incompressible and homogeneous viscoelastic plate coupled to the lipid bilayer .",
    "it remains unclear why such an approximation should suffice for the sparse cytoskeletal network present in rbcs .",
    "additionally , this model seems too simplistic to capture the full range of shape behaviors explained in reference @xcite .",
    "the models mentioned in the preceding paragraph make no mention of the role of energy expenditure in the behavior of rbc membranes .",
    "this despite the fact that it is known that rbc membranes possess kinase and phosphatase activities capable of altering the properties of spectrin and other network associated proteins via ( de)phosphorylation @xcite . and , certain measurements of rbc fluctuation amplitudes show a correlation between atp concentration and fluctuation magnitude @xcite .",
    "one might argue that the difficulty in fitting all rbc behavior to a single elastic model stems from the fact that a truly comprehensive model must incorporate the effects of energy expenditure by the cell in a realistic fashion .",
    "gov and safran @xcite are the first to seriously consider active energy expenditure within the rbc from a theoretical standpoint . they have proposed that atp induced phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the rbc cytoskeletal network leads to a continual dynamic evolution of the integrity of the spectrin network . while this picture remains hypothetical , without direct proof , it is consistent with the general observations relating atp concentration to membrane fluctuation amplitudes .",
    "gov and safran ( gs ) @xcite have used this picture to motivate a simple picture for rbc fluctuations under the presence of atp .",
    "local breaking and reforming of the spectrin network is captured via non - thermal forces imparted on an elastic membrane model .",
    "this model has provided the first plausible explanation for the viscosity dependence of rbc fluctuations @xcite .",
    "while elastic models with proper accounting for non - thermal energetics may eventually prove adequate in describing the long wavelength physics of the rbc , it is clear that wavelengths near or below the spectrin mesh size ( @xmath0 ) must be considered within a more microscopic picture . a recent model by dubus and fournier ( df )",
    "@xcite has extended the traditional elastic modeling of rbc membranes to explicitly include the cytoskeletal network at a molecular level of detail . within this model ,",
    "the spectrin network is considered as a completely regular hexagonal network of phantom entropic springs attached to a fluid lipid bilayer . over wavelengths significantly longer that the spectrin mesh size , the network so modeled becomes mathematically equivalent to an imposed surface tension on the fluid bilayer . at wavelengths comparable to and shorter than network spacing",
    ", the system behaves differently from a simple membrane with applied tension .",
    "this model was used to compute the spectrum of thermal fluctuation amplitudes for the rbc membrane , but made no attempt to account for non - thermal consumption of energy and only computed thermal ( non - dynamic ) observables .    in this paper , we extend the df entropic spring model of the cytoskeleton meshwork to include dynamic evolution of the entire system .",
    "we allow the anchor points between spectrin and membrane to laterally diffuse and we allow for dynamic dissociation and association of spectrin links as a molecular level manifestation of the non - thermal energetic picture proposed by gs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snap ] ) .    one important consequence of the gs picture is that sufficiently high atp concentrations lead to an appreciable fraction of dissociated spectrin links at the membrane surface . depending upon the timescales for spectrin ( re)association , the effective long - wavelength elastic properties of the membrane interpolate between two limiting cases . if spectrin ( re)association kinetics are much slower than all other timescales in the problem , the effective tension imposed by the network ( as inferred by out - of - plane bilayer undulations ) is well predicted by a simple percolation - theory argument ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : perco ] ) . in the opposite limit of fast spectrin kinetics ,",
    "the effective tension is well predicted by assuming each link in the network has a reduced spring constant proportional to the probability of the link being intact at steady state . at intermediate rates ,",
    "simulations are seen to interpolate between the two extreme cases .",
