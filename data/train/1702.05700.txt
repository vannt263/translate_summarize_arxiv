    "[ b3lyp_tran_cond_coherent ] points to the fact that if the fermi energy is shifted by as small as 50 mev ( say due to environmental fluctuations , location of contact atoms and so on ) , the conductance can change by as much as 5 - 10 times .",

    "a few groups @xcite have suggested that decoherence due to electron s interaction with the surrounding environment plays a large part in determining dna conductance .",
    "we now study the influence of decoherence on charge transport through gc8 and gcm8 via the b@xmath0ttiker probes approach to see if our conclusions in the above section change .",
    "we first set the decoherence rate to be 5 mev , a typical value in carbon nanotubes at room temperature @xcite for both strands .",

    "[ b3lyp_tran_cond_deocherent ] .",
    "we find that for both gc8 and gcm8 , after including decoherence , the peaks of the transmission become wider and the transmission values at the peaks are smaller compared to that in phase - coherent transport , due to the broadening of the localized energy levels , while away from the peaks the transmission values increase .",
    "we also note that decoherence can decrease the difference between gc8 and gcm8 for both transmission and conductance .",
    "this effect is more obvious in the homo - lumo ( here , lumo refers to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ) gap .",
    "for example , the transmission of gcm8 with 5 mev decoherence is only 1.2 times larger in the homo - lumo gap , compared to 5 times in the coherent transport .",
    "similarly , the conductance of gcm8 with the inclusion of 5 mev decoherence is 1.5 times larger than gc8 throughout the interested energy region .",
    "as has been pointed out by several groups , the addition of the methyl groups in the cytosine bases can increase the molecular polarizability and help stabilize the dna structure @xcite .",
    "using dft calculation with b3lyp/6 - 31 g , we find that the hydrogen bonding for a single methylated g : c base pair is 23 mev stronger than the unmethylated one .",
    "this indicates that the methylated dna has a more rigid structure and undergoes less fluctuations in the presence of the water molecules , counter ions and other impurities , which may result in a smaller decoherence rate than the native dna strand . to investigate the effect of the change in molecular stability",
    ", we study the transport in terms of the decoherence rate for gcm8 . since the precise value of the decohrence rate due to the structural alteration is hard to determine , we treat it as a variable . the transmission and conductance for gcm8 with decoherence rate ranging from 1 mev to 4 mev",
    "are shown in a series of dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ b3lyp_tran_cond_deocherent ] .",
    "interestingly , as the decoherence rate of gcm8 drops below 5 mev , the transmission of gc8 is larger than gcm8 by a few times , which is in qualitative agreement with the experimental observation that the conductance of gc8 is 1.2 times larger than gcm8 on average .",
    "take the energy point at -4 ev for example . as the decoherence rate of gcm8 decreases from 5 mev to 4 mev , the transmission of gc8 is now 1.2 times larger than gcm8 . as the rate further decreases to 3 mev ,",
    "2 mev and 1 mev , the transmission is 2.1 , 4.4 , 15.7 times larger , respectively . for the conductance plots in the inset of fig .",
    "[ b3lyp_tran_cond_deocherent ] , we find the similar trend . with these analysis",
    ", we suggest that the lower conductance for gcm8 in the experimental measurement is due to the enhanced stability of the molecular structure induced by the methyl groups .",
    "note that the method adopted in this paper to include decoherence can qualitatively handle aspects of energy level broadening introduced by electron - vibrational coupling @xcite but can not model energy gain / loss or polaron formation @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath1 calculations of vibrational energies and the strength of their coupling to electrons is a computationally very challenging problem for large aperiodic systems such as dna .",
    "this field has seen some welcome progress using dft inspired tight - binding approaches @xcite , which may eventually lead to a more fundamental treatment of transport by accounting for self - consistency , dna - contact coupling , electron - vibrational coupling and electron - environment coupling .      as dft calculations are sensitive to the choice of the xc functionals , it is crucial to investigate this effect on transport .",
    "in addition to b3lyp , we consider cam - b3lyp @xcite based range - separated functional .",
    "the choice of the latter is motivated by recent advances in range - separated dft @xcite , where the range - separation parameters are tuned to obey the koopmans theorem , i.e. making the homo as close as possible to the ionization potential ( ip ) of the neutral molecule .    rather than using the default parameters for cam - b3lyp in gaussian 09",

    "it is reasonable to assume that , in the weak molecule - lead coupling limit , the misaligned molecular levels ( for example , from a b3lyp calculation ) with respect to the leads would result in an incorrect molecular response as charge is transferred from the leads into the molecule which should be observable .",
    "however , our transmission results with both b3lyp and the tuned cam - b3lyp yield almost identical results in the vicinity of the homo irrespective of the strength of the contact coupling even though the delocalization and self - interaction errors are minimized in tuned range - separated xc forms @xcite .",
    "we find similar results for gcm8 .",
    "the natural follow - on question is how large is this effect ? , and if it is observable in realistic systems .",
    "the other factor could be the inherent approximations within the green s function - dft approach itself . in order to quantify these effects , a systematic study of charge transport through well - characterized molecular junctions with different xc potentials and range - separation in the weak and strong coupling limits",
    "is needed .",
    "in summary , we have studied the possibility of detecting a methylated dna strand using its electronic properties from a theoretical perspective , based on dft calculations and the landauer - b@xmath0ttiker approach .",
    "we explore the electronic structures and charge transport properties through an eight base - pair methylated dna strand and its native counterpart used in the experiment of ref . .",
    "we first look at the tight - binding parameters of the homo level for the two strands and find that the methylation has a large influence on the on - site energies of cytosine bases and hopping integrals between two nearest neighboring guanine and cytosine bases .",
    "the on - site energies of the methylated cytosine bases are approximately 200 mev higher than that of native cytosine bases .",
    "the intra - strand hopping integrals between two nearest neighboring guanine and cytosine bases from 5 to 3 ends for a methylated strand are about 30 mev stronger than that of native strand , and 15 mev stronger from 3 to 5 ends .",
    "we then carry out transport calculations in both phase - coherent and decoherent cases .",
    "our calculations show that in phase - coherent transport , the transmission of electrons close to the homo band of the two strands are very similar . at energies away from homo , the transmission of gcm8 is larger than gc8 .",
    "the linear response conductances of gc8 and gcm8 are also close to each other , with the conductance of gcm8 being slightly higher than gc8 .",
    "the calculations also show that the conductance of these molecules can change by 5 - 10 times if there is a small shift ( 50 mev ) in the fermi energy due to environmental variations from experiment to experiment . in the phase - decoherent case , we find that the transmission and conductance trends occuring in the phase - coherent limit also hold in the homo vicinity if the decoherence rates for the two strands are the same . however , if the decoherence rate of the methylated strand is lower , we observe that the transmission and conductance of the methylated strand is also lower than the native strand , which is consistent with the experimental findings .",
    "our results show that the effect of the two different functionals is to alter the on - site energies of the dna bases at the homo level , while the transport properties do not depend much on the two functionals .",
    "the authors thank professor joshua hihath at university of california , davis for extensive discussions on experimental conductance measurements of dna strands .",
