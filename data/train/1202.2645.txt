    "the basic question raised by the recent observation of a 1.97-solar - mass ( @xmath0 ) neutron star , psr j1614 - 2230 , using shapiro delay with green bank telescope @xcite , is whether the new degree of freedom such as hyperons , meson condensations ( pions , kaons , ... ) , strange quark matter , and the multitude of other phases are relevant in explaining the existence of high mass compact stars .",
    "the density of the central core is found to be much higher than the normal nuclear density , @xmath1 , up to @xmath2 .",
    "up to @xmath1 , the role of strange degrees of freedom is not significant , but they must figure at some density above @xmath1 in the form of strange mesons ( kaons ) and strange baryons ( hyperons ) . in addressing this issue , we will take a simplified effective field theory approach . instead of treating both kaons and hyperons at the same time",
    ", we will take an effective lagrangian consisting of kaons coupled to nucleons in the sense that the hyperons are integrated out .",
    "it has been first suggested by kaplan and nelson  @xcite that the kaons figure in a condensate state .",
    "we find that kaon condensation will play a role of a  doorway \" to quark matter in a smooth manner@xcite .",
    "hence we can consider compact stars with three phases , nuclear matter ( nm ) in the outer - layer region , kaon condensed nuclear matter ( knm ) , and ( 2 ) strange quark matter ( sqm ) in the inner most region .",
    "we explore how the structure with knm and sqm in the core region affects the microscopic observables [ e.g. , density - dependent electron ( or kaon ) chemical potential ] and macroscopic observables ( e.g. , mass and radius ) of the compact stars .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the simplified model for kaon condensation that we use is described .",
    "we also discuss in detail the microscopic properties of nucleonic matter with kaon condensation and the eos . in sec .",
    "iii , the stellar structure with sqm driven by kaon condensation obtained by integrating the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov ( tov ) equation is discussed . throughout this work",
    ", we set @xmath3 and assume zero temperature .",
    "finally , the results are summarized and discussed in sec . iv .",
    "we consider the simplest effective lagrangian relevant for kaon condensation in the form  @xcite = l_kn + l_nn [ leff]where _ kn & = & _ 0 k^- ^0 k^+ - m^2_k k^+ k^- + _ kn(n^ n + p^p ) k^+",

    ", the amplitude of kaon condensation , @xmath11 , and kaon chemical potential , @xmath12 , are defined by the ansatz k^ = k e^i _ k t. the kaon condensation condition for @xmath13 is obtained by extremizing the classical action , m_k^2 - _",

    "the underlying physics for having kaon condensation , which has relatively lager vacuum mass , is the decrease of the effective mass denoted as @xmath14 , which is basically a function of @xmath18 owing to the kaon - nucleon interactions : m_k^*= _ k(m_k , n , x , ... ) .",

    "we now turn to the possibility that kaon condensation can drive the dense system to a sqm at the critical density @xmath22 defined by the condition , @xmath23 . from @xmath20 up to the critical density for chiral restoration @xmath22 , the weak equilibrium condition reads = 4(1 - 2 x)s_n(n_c ) + ( k,,n_c ) . as the kaon chemical potential ",
    "equivalently effective mass  approaches 0 at the critical density , the solution @xmath24 appears naturally at the phase boundary , provided @xmath25 , which is assumed to be valid for the range of density we are concerned with .",

    "kaon condensed nuclear matter will naturally go over to the sqm in @xmath28 symmetric phase in the massless limit . in this simple picture ,",

    "here @xmath30 denotes the perturbative qcd correction  @xcite , which takes the value @xmath31 .",
    "the equality holds for sqm without qcd corrections .",
    "the possibility of the confinement - deconfinement phase transition to occur at @xmath22 depends on whether the phase boundary matching condition p_knm(n_c ) = p_sqm(n_c^q ) [ pmatch ] is satisfied .",
    "in fact it depends on the parameters used in this work .",
    "if we take @xmath32 mev , the pressure matching can be satisfied at the critical density @xmath33 .",
    "the kaon threshold density is also obtained as @xmath34 . using chemical equilibrium conditions we get the critical quark number densities , @xmath35 .",
    "one can see that @xmath36 are not much different from @xmath22 .",
    "given the critical densities , we can find a possible set of parameters , @xmath30 and @xmath37 .",
    "for example , with @xmath38 , we get @xmath39 .",
    "with the parameter set discussed in the previous section , we can consider a triple - layered structure shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ nkqpre ] consisting of nm , knm , and sqm from the outer layer to the core part .",
    "in contrast to the case considered above , there will be an unstable region between @xmath20 and @xmath40 , for which we have to resort to maxwell or gibbs construction . in the maxwell construction",
    ", it turns out to be impossible to match the chemical potential , which signals instability . in the gibbs construction",
    ", however , there appears a mixed phase of nm and knm . in this work",
    ", we take a rather simple approach , namely , allow the discontinuity of density and chemical potential by assuming that nm with the density @xmath20 changes into knm with the density @xmath41 at the phase boundary defined by p(n_t ) = p(n_t ) .",
    "we use eqs .",

    "[ mr- ] the resulting mass - radius relation is plotted .",
    "there is no sharp jump in density at the phase boundary of sqm and knm , which implies that the kaon - driven sqm transition is a rather smooth transition in this scenario .",

    "strange quark matter can appear as a result of confinement - deconfinement phase transition at higher density .",
    "this phase transition is basically a strong interaction process .",
    "we discuss the characteristics of the phase change when kaons are present in the form of condensate .",
    "then there is already non - vanishing strangeness in the nm up to the phase boundary . in this case",
    ", we can imagine the confinement - deconfinement phase transition taking place constrained by the weak equilibrium in the kaon condensed matter , leading to sqm .",
    "it leads to the scenario in which kaon condensation joins smoothly a sqm .",
    "this scenario was predicted a long time ago by a @xmath48 bound to a skyrmion embedded in hypersphere  @xcite .    for kaon - nuclear interactions , we take the simplest chiral effective lagrangian at tree order . as for nuclear interactions ,",
    "we take lck s empirically parameterized form for the energy density and symmetry energy .",
    "although there are potentially serious effects that are missing in this simple treatments , we take it as a viable basis of our analysis @xcite . we illustrate that the compact star with an nm - knm - sqm structure is possible with the parameters that are not excluded by theory or phenomenology .    with @xmath49 mev ,",
    "the three - layer structure of nm , knm , and sqm with an appropriate bag constant is possible beyond the critical density , @xmath50 . and the maximum mass of a neutron star with the three - layer structure can be made consistent with the recent observation of psr j1614 - 2230 .",
