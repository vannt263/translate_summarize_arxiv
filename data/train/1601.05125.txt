    "lotka - volterra models , that describe the predator - prey interaction , and epidemic models , that describe the spread of transmissible diseases among some population , are two major subjects of study in mathematical biology .    in the natural world , infected individuals become weaker and easier to be predated . thus , in the predator - prey interaction , diseases can not be ignored .",
    "models that describe the spread of a disease in ecological systems are seldom referred to as eco - epidemiological models and are obtained by adding infected compartments to a lotka - volterra system .",
    "several works concerning eco - epidemiological models have appeared recently : existence of hopf bifurcations was studied in  @xcite and , for a model with stage structure , stability and existence of hopf bifurcations were discussed in  @xcite ; for models with impulsive birth , it was established the existence of positive periodic solutions assuming that the birth pulse is strong enough in  @xcite and the existence of a globally stable prey eradication solution when the impulsive period is less than some critical value as well as a sufficient condition for permanence of the disease were obtained in  @xcite ; for a model with distributed time delay and impulsive control , conditions for the local and global asymptotical stability of the prey eradication periodic solution and the permanence of the disease were discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that all the works above refer to models with constant parameters .    in this work",
    "we will consider the periodic version of the non - autonomous eco - epidemiological model already considered in  @xcite : @xmath1 this model assumes that the total prey population is divided in two population classes : the class @xmath2 of susceptible prey and the class @xmath3 of infected prey .",
    "the remaining class , @xmath4 , corresponds to the predator population .",
    "the parameters in the model are the following : @xmath5 is the recruited rate of the prey population ( including newborns and migratory ) , @xmath6 is the natural death rate of the prey population , @xmath7 is the death rate among the infected prey population and includes the natural death rate and the disease - related death rate ( naturally , @xmath8 for all @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 is the incidence rate , @xmath11 is the intrinsic birth rate of the predators , @xmath12 is the predation rate and @xmath13 is the rate of converting prey into predator",
    ".    several assumptions , reflected in the model s equations , were made .",
    "it was assumed that , in the absence of disease , the growth rate of the prey population is given by the solutions of @xmath14 and that the predator population grows according to a logistic curve .",
    "another assumption is that the infected prey is removed by death or by predation before having the possibility of reproducing .",
    "additionally , it is also assumed that the disease is not transmissible to the predator population , that the disease is not genetically inherited and that the infected population do not recover or become immune .    in  @xcite ,",
    "conditions for the permanence and extinction of the infective prey as well as sufficient conditions for the global stability of the model were obtained .",
    "also in that paper , in the end of section 4 , the authors leave a conjecture .",
    "namely , the authors conjecture that , if the parameter functions in   are @xmath15-periodic , continuous and bounded functions on @xmath16 ( with all but @xmath17 being nonnegative and all but @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 having positive average ) and if @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the unique positive periodic solutions of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , then model   has a positive periodic solution which is globally attractive in the interior of first octant .",
    "in what follows we will prove the existence part of this conjecture .",
    "additionally , we will also consider the extinction situation .",
    "it follows from the results in  @xcite that , in the periodic context , if @xmath26 , the infected prey in system   is permanent and , if @xmath27 , the infected prey in system   goes to extinction .",
    "thus @xmath28 is a sharp threshold between permanence and extinction of the disease . in this work",
    "we prove that , in the periodic context , @xmath28 is also a sharp threshold between existence of exactly two disease - free periodic orbits that contain the @xmath15-limit of all solutions and the coexistence of the referred disease free orbits ( that become unstable ) with at least one endemic periodic orbit .",
    "the prove of our result on existence of periodic orbits relies on the famous mawhin continuation theorem  @xcite . to obtain our sharp result instead of a non - optimal condition ,",
    "it is fundamental to use the permanence of the infectives already established in  @xcite . to discuss the stability of the disease - free orbit",
    ", we use the theory developed in  @xcite .",
    "given a continuous and @xmath15-periodic function @xmath29 , we define @xmath30 } f(t ) \\quad \\text{and } \\quad f^\\ell=\\min_{t \\in [ 0,\\omega ] } f(t)\\ ] ]    we assume that the following conditions hold :    1 .   [",

    "[ eq : cond-2 ] @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "these solutions have period @xmath15 .",
    "thus , it is easy to check that @xmath47 and @xmath48 are disease - free periodic solutions of system   and have period @xmath15 .    using the theory developed in  @xcite",

    "in fact , it follows from corollaries 1 and 2 in  @xcite that when @xmath20 the infected prey is permanent and , when @xmath58 the infected prey goes to extinction .",
    "it follows from theorem 2.2 in  @xcite and corollary 2 in  @xcite that the periodic orbit @xmath43 is locally asymptotically stable when @xmath59 and unstable when @xmath26 .",
