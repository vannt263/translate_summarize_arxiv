    "the control of molecular dynamics by laser pulses has been a long - standing goal in the field of molecular physics , both from experimental and theoretical points of view ( for a recent review , see @xcite and references therein ) . molecular alignment or orientation induced by an intense laser field",
    "is one of the most challenging processes , with applications extending from chemical reactivity to nanoscale design @xcite . in this context",
    ", many efforts , based on physical intuition or on optimal control strategies , have been made to construct control schemes , but with a limited success .",
    "for this reason , several works @xcite have pointed out the connection between these results and tools of control theory .",
    "in particular , they have established kinematical bounds and determined the controllability of both pure and mixed - state molecular systems . more precisely , since the time - evolution operator is a unitary operator , only target states ( corresponding to a pure or a mixed - state ) which are unitarily equivalent to the initial state are kinematically attainable .",
    "this constraint is crucial since it determines the upper and lower bounds of the time - evolution of the expectation value of an arbitrary observable .",
    "however , it is important to remark that kinematical attainability is not synonymous with dynamical realizability , i.e. the possibility of finding a path of unitary operators , which satisfy the time - dependent schr@xmath0dinger equation and bring the initial state to the target state within a class of physically realizable interactions . for control - linear processes ( i.e. for hamiltonians depending in a linear way on the control functions ) of non - dissipative finite - level quantum systems , the dynamical realizability of the process depends on the dimension of the lie algebra generated by the unperturbed hamiltonian and the coupling operator @xcite .",
    "we have recently proposed a laser control strategy @xcite , for a molecular system initially in a pure quantum state , aiming at the maximalization ( or minimalization ) of the expectation value of a given observable , which does not commute with the field - free hamiltonian .",
    "this control scheme consists in applying sudden pulses each time a given quantity ( such as the expectation value of the observable under consideration ) reaches its maximum .",
    "we notice that there are several other methods for controlling molecular dynamics using , for instance , adiabatic passage techniques @xcite , factorizations of unitary operators @xcite or optimal control schemes @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to extend our control scheme to mixed - state quantum systems .",
    "our concern is twofold : the identification of a well defined target density operator and the determination of a control scheme for reaching this target .",
    "both steps are very general in their principle and their usefulness , such that the overall procedure may be extended to different control objectives .",
    "alignment / orientation dynamics of a diatomic molecule are taken as examples , emphasizing the effects of non - zero temperature @xcite .",
    "the drastic decrease of alignment / orientation with temperature basically results from an initial superposition of rotational states with @xmath1 ( @xmath2 being the projection of the total molecular angular momentum on the field polarization axis ) , which tends to misalign / misorient the molecule .",
    "the identification of a target state as presented in this paper , together with the control strategy to reach it , is actually a very powerful tool .",
    "the analysis of the target state by itself may be also very instructive .",
    "an interesting counterintuitive example is the alignment / orientation of a diatomic molecule using differently polarized lasers .",
    "the simple examination of the two target states attainable by linear ( no modification of @xmath2 ) or elliptical ( inducing modifications of @xmath2 ) polarized lasers shows that they lead to alignment / orientation properties that are very close to each other , rendering the use of elliptical polarizability unnecessary for diatomic systems . as for the control strategy , for non - dissipative systems ( considered in this paper ) the perturbations , described by unitary operators applied at given time intervals , yield spectacular results : the target state may be quite accurately and robustly reached within only a few perturbations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we outline the principles of the control strategy in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] .",
    "section [ section3 ] is devoted to the control of the alignment / orientation processes , taken on a parallel footing .",
    "concluding remarks and prospective views are presented in sec .",
    "[ section4 ] .",
    "some details of the discussion are reported in appendixes [ appb ] and [ appc ] .",
    "this section outlines the principles of our control scheme in terms of a target state and the strategy to reach it .",
    "this has roughly an overall similitude with the scheme followed for a pure quantum state @xcite , but the two approaches have to be contrasted at the level of the target state . in the pure - state case",
    ", it is a specific linear combination of rotational states , constituting a wavepacket evolving through the schr@xmath0dinger equation . in the mixed - state case ,",
    "the target is a density operator whose evolution is determined by the von neumann equation .",
    "the specific properties of the target density matrix can not be inferred from a boltzmann superposition of wavefunctions , separately time - propagated , i.e. it can not be obtained from the analysis of refs @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we consider a mixed - state quantum system whose elements , the density operators @xmath3 , act on the hilbert space @xmath4 .",
    "a density operator can be written as : @xmath5 where the @xmath6 s are the eigenvalues of @xmath7 which fulfill the following conditions : @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath10 s are the normalized eigenstates of @xmath7 . using atomic units ( @xmath11 )",
    ", @xmath3 evolves according to the von neumann equation : @xmath12 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "the control being exerted through the application of a time - dependent external field , @xmath13 is taken of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are , respectively , the field - free hamiltonian and the coupling operator .",
    "@xmath17 is a real control function that can be turned on or off at will . for a given self - adjoint operator @xmath18 , which does not commute with @xmath15 , and an initial state @xmath19 , the goal of the control is to maximize or minimize the expectation value @xmath20 \\ .\\ ] ] more precisely , the goal is to find a path of unitary operators @xmath21 , which satisfy the time - dependent schr@xmath0dinger equation [ with an hamiltonian of the form ( [ math2 ] ) ] and bring @xmath19 to the target state @xmath22 , for which @xmath23 is a maximum or a minimum .",
    "+ the set up of the control strategy consists of four steps .",
    "the first step is the reduction of the original physical hilbert space @xmath4 ( possibly infinite ) to a finite @xmath24-dimensional subspace @xmath25 . from the physical point of view",
    ", this reduction can be qualitatively justified by the fact that moderate perturbations , i.e. a finite number of applied pulses with moderate amplitude , can only transfer finite amounts of energy to the system , which stays thus essentially confined in a finite - dimensional subspace @xcite .",
    "this reduction drastically simplifies the study of both kinematical constraints and dynamical realizability as we will show below . in the subspace @xmath25 ,",
    "we consider the reduced operator @xmath26 , which is defined by @xmath27 @xmath28 being the projector on @xmath25 . to simplify the notation",
    ", we omit the superscript @xmath29 for the operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the rest of the paper .",
    "finally , we also assume that the field - free evolution is periodic with period @xmath30 , which means that all the fundamental frequencies of @xmath15 in @xmath25 are commensurate and integer multiples of a fundamental frequency @xmath31 .",
    "we next define the initial state .",
    "we assume that the system is initially in thermal equilibrium with a bath at temperature @xmath32 .",
    "the initial density operator @xmath19 is then the canonical density operator , written here in the basis of the eigenvectors @xmath33 of @xmath15 : @xmath34=\\frac{1}{z}\\sum_{n=1}^n \\exp\\left[-\\frac{e_n}{k_b t}\\right ] |n\\rangle\\langle n| \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath35 $ ] is the partition function , @xmath36 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath37 .",
    "the difference of treatment between pure and mixed - state quantum systems at this first step is that , while the initial state of a pure quantum system is usually a single eigenstate of @xmath15 @xcite , that of a mixed - state system is a density operator involving a thermal average of all eigenstates of @xmath15 .",
    "the second step consists in determining a target state @xmath22 which both maximizes ( or minimizes ) the expectation value @xmath38 and is unitarily equivalent to the initial state .",
    "the general characterization of this target state is adapted from a recent work of girardeau and co - workers @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the density operator which maximizes @xmath39 commutes with @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "these two operators can therefore be simultaneously diagonalized .",
    "moreover , due to the constraint of unitary evolution , @xmath19 and @xmath40 have the same eigenvalues @xmath41 with the same multiplicity .",
    "the expectation value @xmath42 $ ] can thus be written as follows : @xmath43=\\sum_{k=1}^n \\chi_k\\omega_{\\sigma_k } \\ , \\ ] ] where the @xmath44 s are the eigenvalues of @xmath26 and the @xmath45 s the optimal permutation of the eigenvalues @xmath41 s of @xmath19 , which is defined as the permutation which associates the highest eigenvalue of @xmath22 with the highest one of @xmath26 , the second highest with the second one , and so forth .",
    "we denote @xmath46 the resulting density operator which maximizes @xmath26 and which is precisely our target in the reduced space @xmath25 .",
    "this density operator is not unique if the spectrum of @xmath26 is degenerate .",
    "here again , we emphasize that the target to be reached in our control scheme of mixed - state quantum systems is a specifically build density operator , as opposite to the case of a pure - state quantum system where the target corresponds to the eigenvector of @xmath26 associated with the highest eigenvalue @xcite .    the third step deals with the dynamical realizability of the target state .",
    "in other words , an initial density operator and a target being given , the question is to know if there exists a path of unitary operators that bring the system from one to the other .",
    "a sufficient condition to ensure the dynamical attainability of the target is the complete controllability of the system .",
    "we recall that a control - linear system is completely controllable if the dynamical lie algebra @xmath47 generated by the skew - hermitian operators @xmath48 and @xmath49 is @xmath50 .",
    "however , it is noted that this condition is a strong requirement which is not necessary .",
    "a less strong condition is the notion of connectivity where a non - zero amplitude of the evolution operator between the initial and the target states only is required @xcite .",
    "here , in order to clarify the discussion in the general context we assume the complete controllability of the process .",
    "the last step of the control strategy consists in explicitely finding a control scheme which allows us to attain this target .",
    "we devise two control strategies which are in the spirit of our analysis for pure - state quantum systems @xcite , while they differ in the definition of the targets .",
    "more precisely , they consist respectively in applying pulses each time @xmath51 ( strategy @xmath52 ) or @xmath53/\\textrm{tr}[(\\rho^{(n)}_f)^2]$ ] ( strategy @xmath54 ) reaches a global maximum within a period @xmath30 of the field - free dynamics .",
    "the unitary operator @xmath21 satisfying the schr@xmath0dinger equation can then be written as a product of terms of the form : @xmath55u_{\\tilde a } \\ , \\ ] ] the first factor @xmath56 $ ] corresponding to the field - free motion and the second one to the application of the pulse .",
    "@xmath57 is here the time delay between pulses and @xmath58 a real control parameter .",
    "moreover , we assume that @xmath59 commutes with @xmath26 or with @xmath46 ( depending on the strategy @xmath52 or @xmath54 ) so that its application does not alter @xmath51 or @xmath60 . more precisely , denoting the operator @xmath61 as @xmath26 or @xmath62 , we have @xmath63=\\textrm{tr}[u_{\\tilde{a}}\\rho(t)u_{\\tilde{a}}^{-1}\\mathcal{b } ] \\ , \\ ] ] which proves the claim .",
    "as opposed to the value of the function @xmath64 $ ] , its derivative can be altered by the application of the pulse .",
    "indeed , the slope given , before the excitation , by @xmath65|_{t_0 - 0}=\\textrm{tr}[\\rho(t_0)[h_0,\\mathcal{b}]]=0 \\ , \\ ] ] changes into @xmath66|_{t_0 + 0}=\\textrm{tr}[\\rho(t_0 ) u_{\\tilde{a}}^{-1}[h_0,\\mathcal{b}]u_{\\tilde{a } } ] \\ , \\ ] ] when a pulse is applied at time @xmath67 .",
    "we next notice that the two functions @xmath51 and @xmath68 are periodic , continuous and differentiable ( under field - free evolution ) , leading thus to an increasing ( possibly constant ) , bounded and therefore convergent sequence of maxima .",
    "the limit of this sequence is a fixed point , i.e. a density operator @xmath69 such that @xmath70=\\textrm{tr}[u_{\\tilde{a}}\\rho_fu_{\\tilde{a}}^{-1}\\mathcal{b } ] \\ , \\ ] ] is a global maximum within a period @xmath30 , for any value of @xmath58 . in other words , for the mixed state @xmath69",
    "this means that one can not find a value of @xmath58 such that the dynamics passes through ( under free evolution ) a maximum strictly larger than the one just before the pulse .",
    "we denote by @xmath71 the set of the fixed points . due to the difficulty to determine @xmath71 exactly",
    ", we consider a larger set @xmath72 , defined as the set of density operators @xmath7 which fulfill the following requirements : @xmath73=0 \\ , \\ ] ] and @xmath74u_{\\tilde{a}}]=0 \\ , \\ ] ] for all values of @xmath58 .",
    "if the slope of @xmath75 $ ] at time @xmath67 undergoes a change from zero before the pulse : @xmath76|_{t_0 - 0}=\\textrm{tr}[\\rho(t_0)[h_0,\\mathcal{b}]]=0 \\ , \\ ] ] to a finite value : @xmath65|_{t_0 + 0}=\\textrm{tr}[\\rho(t_0 ) u_{\\tilde{a}}^{-1}[h_0,\\mathcal{b}]u_{\\tilde{a}}]\\neq 0 \\ , \\ ] ] then , @xmath64 $ ] being periodic and continuous , it will reach a maximum that is strictly larger within a period @xmath30 . in this way , we can therefore conclude that @xmath77 and that @xmath72 contains @xmath71 .",
    "straigthforward calculations ( see appendix [ appb ] for details ) show that a density operator @xmath78 if @xmath7 commutes with @xmath61 .",
    "we can then ask the conditions on @xmath15 , @xmath59 and @xmath26 such that these density operators be the only elements of @xmath72 and the unique fixed points of the strategy .",
    "appendix [ appb ] provides a sufficient condition on these operators .",
    "however , this condition does not completely justify the control strategy and several open questions are in order : what is the domain of attraction of each fixed point , how large is the domain of the target state ....    as a conclusion , we claim that the formulation of this control scheme for mixed - state quantum systems is general and powerful in the sense that it emphasizes the mathematical definition of a target density operator that maximizes the expectation value of the observable @xmath18 and a systematic strategy to reach it through a set of unitary perturbations applied at determined time intervals . in particular , the construction of the target constitutes the real originality of the previous scheme in comparison with the one for pure - state quantum systems .",
    "the application of this control scheme to molecular alignment / orientation dynamics will be the subject of the next section , where the definition of the target will be highlighted and the efficiency of the preceding strategies will be shown numerically .",
    "this section is devoted to the application of the strategy for controlling the alignment / orientation dynamics of polar diatomic molecules .",
    "we consider a molecule described in a rigid - rotor approximation interacting with a linearly polarized electromagnetic pulse .",
    "the following molecular hamiltonian @xmath79 , already investigated in a previous paper @xcite dealing with the control of pure - state quantum systems , will serve as an illustration .",
    "the time - dependent schr@xmath80dinger equation which governs the dynamics can be written as : @xmath81\\psi(\\theta,\\phi ; s ) \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the angular momentum operator , @xmath83 and @xmath84 denoting respectively the polar angle and the azimuthal angle .",
    "the operators @xmath85 , corresponding to the radiative interaction terms for the alignment / orientation processes , are defined respectively as follows : @xmath86 and @xmath87 @xmath88 and @xmath89 being the dimensionless interaction strength .",

    "we also recall that , due to the cylindrical symmetry , the projection @xmath2 of the total angular momentum @xmath100 on the field polarization axis is a conserved quantum number .    from the practical point of view , we are interested in short duration pulses , the duration of the pulse being compared with the molecular rotational period @xmath101 .",

    "in the different figures , time is indicated in fractions of the licl rotational period .    in this section , we are interested in the dynamical behavior of the two quantities @xmath173 $ ] and @xmath160/\\textrm{tr}[(\\rho_{lin}^{(8)})^2]$ ] , which correspond respectively to the expectation value of the observable @xmath109 and to the projection on the target state @xmath165 . except for figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] , it is noted that all results are displayed for times starting at the first pulse ( taken thus at the origin ) and extending up to one rotational period @xmath174 after the last pulse .",
    "this helps in showing the complete field - free behavior of the dynamics and the well - known revival structures .",
    "the results of the strategy @xmath52 for the alignment and orientation processes are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "as could be expected , the alignment dynamics presents a more strongly oscillating structure as compared with the orientation one .",
    "this difference explains the different choice of parameters @xmath175 , @xmath24 and the number of kicks in these two processes . in all cases , panels ( b )",
    "show that the density operator @xmath3 gets close to the target state @xmath165 , which also shows that the rotational dynamics roughly resides within @xmath161 .",
    "it can furthermore be checked that the postpulse dynamics lead to very good results in terms of efficiency and duration .",
    "indeed , an efficiency of about 0.75 and a duration of about 1/20 of the rotational period ( that is about 1 ps for a light molecule like licl ) is obtained for the orientation . to our knowledge , this is the largest duration and efficiency achieved up to date for such a thermal ensemble .    in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we display the mean values @xmath173 $ ] and @xmath160/\\textrm{tr}[(\\rho_{lin}^{(8)})^2]$ ] computed with the strategy @xmath54 for the case of orientation .",
    "it is seen that very close results are obtained with respect to figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and the strategy @xmath52 , which shows the similarity between the two control schemes .",
    "note that a smaller number of pulses , i.e. 9 , is used for @xmath54 .    finally , the evolution after the last kick for the alignment / orientation processes are plotted in figs . [ fig6 ] , which , in addition , also display the dynamical behavior of the two optimals , @xmath165 and @xmath164 .",
    "we notice that the control strategy allows us to obtain a density operator with free dynamics very close to the optimal one , both in efficiency and duration . once again",
    ", these results stress the importance of the target states since they give a clear insight into the free dynamics of the molecule .",
    "a precise mathematical definition of a target provides a completely new insight to the control issue of a system using a time dependent external field .",
    "complementary to what is done for pure - state quantum systems @xcite where the target is an eigenvector of a given observable projected onto a finite dimensional hilbert subspace , the target in the mixed - state case is a non - trivial density matrix constructed as a specific combination of the eigenvectors of a given observable through weighting factors related with the initial statistics of the mixed system .",
    "once the target is identified and its attainability established , two possible strategies to reach it are thoroughly analyzed .",
    "they amount to apply a series of unitary perturbations each time @xmath176 $ ] or @xmath177 $ ] reaches a global maximum ( or minimum ) under free evolution .",
    "an illustration is given by considering the laser control of molecular alignment / orientation in thermal equilibrium .",
    "although some previous works have already used the strategy of applying trains of short laser pulses , the originality resides here in the practical construction of the target density matrix and in comparing the optimal alignment / orientation actually obtained to the ones which are the best theoretically possible within the reduced subspace supporting the dynamics .    as a prospect ,",
    "an important open question in this field is the applicability of the present method to more complicated systems involving , for instance , an interaction with a physical environment or a dissipative system @xcite .",
    "the answer is not obvious because the strategy would involve non - unitary evolution and special attention has to be paid to decoherence @xcite .",
    "moreover , for an important class of dissipative systems such as laser cooling , the dissipation can increase the purity of the state @xcite . in this case",
    ", the optimal target state would be the one defined in ref .",
    "@xcite for pure - state quantum systems .",
