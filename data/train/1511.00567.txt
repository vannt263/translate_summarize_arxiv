    "access networks are communication networks that interconnect private local area networks , such as the networks in the homes of individuals , with public metropolitan and core networks , such as those constructed by service providers to connect paying subscribers to the internet .",
    "private local area networks often employ high speed wired and wireless communications technologies , such as ieee 802.3 ethernet ( up to 1 gbit / sec ) and ieee 802.11 wifi ( up to 600 mbit / sec ) .",
    "these high - speed communications technologies are cost effective in private local area networks due to the short distances involved and subsequent low installation costs .",
    "public metropolitan and core networks employ a variety of communication technologies that include dense wavelength division multiplexed technologies over fiber optic transmission channels ( up to 1 tbit / sec ) .",
    "these high - speed communication technologies are cost effective due to the cost sharing over many paying subscribers .",
    "access networks require significantly higher installation costs compared to private local area networks due to larger distances that must be covered . at the same time , access networks have significantly smaller degrees of cost sharing compared to public metropolitan and core networks ; thereby increasing cost per paying subscriber . as a result",
    ", access network technologies must keep installation costs low  @xcite . utilizing existing bandwidth - limited copper wire or shared optical fiber",
    "will keep installation costs low  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present our study of hybrid access networks that utilize both copper wire and shared optical fiber .",
    "the shared optical fiber extends from the service provider s central office to a drop - point whereby the final few hundred meters to the subscriber premise are reached by existing twisted - pair copper wire .",
    "figure [ fig : pondslnet ] illustrates this hybrid access network architecture that leverages the installation cost benefits of existing copper wire and the latest advances in digital subscriber line ( dsl )  @xcite technology that can realize up to 1 gbps over short distances of twisted - pair copper wire .",
    "the optical fiber segment of this hybrid access network is organized as a shared passive optical network ( pon ) , whereby multiple optical network units ( onus ) share a single optical fiber connected to an optical line terminal ( olt ) at the service provider central office .",
    "the copper segments begin at each onu whereby the fiber is dropped and existing copper wires are utilized via dsl transmission technology to reach each subscriber premise .",
    "each onu is coupled with a dsl access multiplexer ( dslam ) at the fiber drop - point .",
    "this so - called drop - point device is active and therefore requires electric power to operate .",
    "however , service providers want these devices to maintain the _ deploy - anywhere _ property of the optical splitter / combiner in a typical pon . to maintain this property ,",
    "each drop - point device is reverse powered using a subscriber s power source .",
    "for this reason , it is of critical importance to reduce the energy consumption of this device .",
    "reducing the memory capacity of the drop - point is an option for reducing its energy consumption .",
    "a drop - point with a small memory capacity translates into a design with a smaller memory device that contains fewer transistors and capacitors that consume energy .",
    "however , reducing the memory capacity of a drop - point can result in significant packet loss if measures are not taken to back - pressure the buffering into either the olt in the downstream direction , or the dsl customer premise equipment ( cpe ) in the upstream direction .",
    "the magnitude of buffering that can occur at the drop - point is quite large due to the transmission bit rate mismatch between the dsl line and the pon .",
    "flow control mechanisms are , therefore , required to avoid significant packet loss . in this paper we specifically examine several upstream polling strategies for controlling the flow of upstream data from each cpe to its associated drop - point device  @xcite .",
    "the objective of these strategies is to minimize the maximum buffer occupancy required at each drop - point with very low or no packet loss .      providing digital data communication through the access network emerged with digital subscriber loop or line ( dsl ) technology in the late 1970s and early 1980s  @xcite . at that time , researchers identified mechanisms to aggregate digital data signals with analog telephony signals and identified effective power levels and coding mechanisms to tolerate the transmission impairments of the copper loops used for analog telephony .",
    "these impairments included signal reflections , cross - talk , and impulse noise  @xcite .",
    "recent efforts exploit multiple - input - multiple - output ( mimo ) or vectoring techniques to cancel the crosstalk impairment  @xcite .",
    "systems using these techniques can achieve approximately 1 gbps transmission using four twisted pairs across distances up to 300 meters  @xcite .",
    "the recently developed g.fast  @xcite dsl standard utilizes vectoring techniques to achieve up to 1 gbps speeds over these short distances .",
    "passive optical networks were envisioned in the late 1980s and early 1990s as an alternative to copper transmission between service provider central offices and subscriber premises  @xcite .",
    "a pon utilizes a shared fiber optic transmission medium shared by up to a few dozen subscribers thereby reducing per - subscriber installation costs .",
    "further , pons employ passive devices between the service provider s central office and the subscriber premises to also reduce recurring operational costs .",
    "standardization of pon technologies began around the early 2000s ( e.g. , ethernet pons  @xcite ) and have subsequently achieved widespread deployment in the past few years .",
    "each of the various pon standards has considered the dynamic bandwidth allocation ( dba ) algorithms that decide how various subscribers share the bandwidth of the optical fiber out of scope . as a result ,",
    "research activity on dba algorithms started around the time the standards were being developed  @xcite .",
    "hybrid access network designs combine several transmission media types ( e.g. , fiber , copper , free space )  @xcite to reach subscribers .",
    "hybrid fiber and copper access networks  @xcite provide a good balance between the increased bandwidth of fiber optic transmission and the cost benefits of using already deployed copper transmission lines .",
    "wireless technologies in access networks add both a very low - cost installation option by using free space transmission as well as mobility features for users .",
    "although there is significant literature on the integration of pons with wireless transmission media , e.g. , woban  @xcite and fiwi  @xcite , there is a dearth of literature on the integration of pons with copper transmission media .    around the time",
    "the various pon standards were being developed , researchers proposed developing hybrid pon / xdsl access networks",
    ". these hybrid access networks would utilize dsl transmission technologies with existing twisted - pair copper wire in conjunction with pons . in @xcite an early pon standard called itu - t 983.1 broadband pon ( bpon )",
    "was coupled with vdsl to reach subscribers in a cost - effective manner .",
    "specifically , an architecture for a combined onu / vdsl line card ( drop - point ) device that bridged a single vdsl line onto the pon was described in  @xcite .",
    "a full demonstration system for transferring mpeg-2 video through a bpon / vdsl network using the onu / vdsl line card  @xcite was presented in  @xcite . in @xcite , a mathematical model of the number of vdsl subscribers that can be serviced by a single onu as a function of a few vdsl parameters ( e.g. , symmetric operation and bit rates ) was presented .",
    "this model can help service providers design their pon / xdsl networks to support the desired number of subscribers . in a study on qos - aware intra - onu scheduling for pons  @xcite ,",
    "hybrid pon / xdsl access networks were noted as a promising candidate for cost - effective broadband access . this early work on hybrid pon / xdsl access networks demonstrated its feasibility and provided some analysis for capacity planning but ignored detailed design elements of the drop - point device that bridges the pon with the various dsl lines connecting to subscribers .",
    "two physical - layer systems to bridge vdsl signals over a fiber access network were proposed in  @xcite .",
    "individual vdsl signals are converted to be spectrally stacked into a composite signal that modulates an optical carrier . in the first system the optical carrier is supplied by a laser at the onu and in the second system the optical carrier is supplied by a laser in the olt that is reflected and modulated by a reflective semiconductor optical amplifier ( rsoa ) at the onu .",
    "the optical carrier provides 1 ghz of spectral width accommodating 40 vdsl lines without guard bands and 25 vdsl lines with guard bands .",
    "although , this approach to a hybrid pon / xdsl allows the drop - point device to avoid buffering as well as contain simple logic by pulling the dslam functionality into the olt , the design requires the pon to carry the full bandwidth of each vdsl line even when idle .",
    "designs that operate at the link layer rather than physical layer can avoid transmission of idle data on the pon thereby increasing the number of subscribers that can be supported by capitalizing on statistical multiplexing gains .",
    "the coaxial copper cable deployed by cable companies represents another existing copper technology that can be used in conjunction with pons to create a hybrid access network .",
    "such a hybrid access network combining an ethernet pon with an ethernet over coax ( eoc ) network was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the proposed network uses epon protocols on the eoc segment in isolation from the epon segment without any coordination between the segments .",
    "a similar network was examined in  @xcite in terms of the blocking probability and delay for a video - on - demand service .",
    "none of these studies discussed the design of the drop - point device or explored dba algorithms for these types of networks .    in november 2011 ,",
    "the ieee 802.3 working group initiated the creation of a study to extend the epon protocol over hybrid fiber - coax cable television networks ; the developing standard is referred to as epon protocol over coax ( epoc )  @xcite .",
    "developing bandwidth allocation schemes for epoc has received little research attention to date .",
    "in particular , a dba algorithm that increases channel utilization in spite of increased propagation delays due to the coaxial copper network was designed in  @xcite .",
    "mechanisms to map ethernet frame transmissions to / from the time division multiplexed channel of the pon to the time and frequency division multiplexed coaxial network have been studied in  @xcite .      in this paper",
    "we contribute the first hybrid pon / xdsl drop - point design providing lowered energy consumption by means of reduced buffering requirements .",
    "we mitigate the packet loss effects of the small drop - point buffers by defining and evaluating several polling strategies that contain flow control .",
    "although we focus on xdsl as the copper technology in the hybrid access networks , our proposed flow control polling protocols can be analogously employed with other copper technologies , such as coax cable .",
    "we define polling mechanisms that place the dsl cpes under the control of the pon olt . with this flow control mechanism",
    "the polling mac protocols that have been designed for pons are extended to a second stage of polling in the dsl segments .",
    "we call this mechanism gated flow control as the olt on the pon not only grants transmission access to onus on the pon but determines when dsl cpes transmit upstream to their attached onus . as far as we know , we are the first to explore joint upstream transmission coordination for hybrid pon / xdsl access networks .",
    "the work presented in this paper provides significant extensions to the work we presented at two conferences  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", we presented a preliminary form of one of the two gated flow control mechanisms along with some initial simulation results . in  @xcite , we present simulation results for one dba algorithm , namely ( online , limited )  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in this article we comprehensively specify two gated flow control protocols through detailed analysis of the cpe transmission timing ( scheduling ) and present extensive simulation results that include the ( online , gated ) and ( online , excess ) dba algorithms .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the pon / xdsl network architecture and outline flow control based on conventional pon polling in conjunction with the standard ethernet pause frame .      as illustrated in figure [ fig : pondslnet ] , a pon / xdsl hybrid access network connects multiple cpe devices @xmath0 , each via its own dsl , to a drop - point device .",

    "we explore reducing buffering at the drop - point to reduce energy consumption . by reducing the _ maximum buffer occupancy _ ,",
    "the drop - point can be designed with a reduced memory capacity that will translate into fewer energy consuming transistors and/or capacitors .",
    "we utilize flow control strategies through mac polling to control buffering at each drop - point .",
    "we introduce three upstream polling strategies that provide flow control :    1 .",
    "onu polling with pause frame flow control 2 .",

    ", each cpe continuously transmits upstream on its attached dsl . to control the flow of upstream traffic so as to reduce the maximum buffer occupancy , we utilize the standard ethernet pause frame flow control : when an ethernet receiver s buffer reaches a certain threshold that ethernet node transmits a pause frame to the attached node in a point - to - point configuration . upon receipt of the pause frame , an ethernet transmitter squelches its transmission for the time period indicated in the pause frame . in the pon / xdsl network ,",
    "the drop - point monitors its upstream dsl buffer and once its occupancy reaches a certain threshold , the drop - point transmits a pause frame downstream to the dsl cpe . when the dsl cpe receives the pause frame it squelches its transmission for the time period indicated in the pause frame .",
    "our proposed upstream onu : cpe polling strategies extend the olt mac polling  @xcite to each dsl cpe .",
    "a dsl cpe transmits upstream only when explicitly polled by the pon olt with a gate message .",
    "the pon olt conducts two stages of polling , the first stage polls each onu and the second stage polls each cpe .",
    "more specifically , in a given cycle , the olt sends a gate message to the onu to grant the onu an upstream transmission window for the data and bandwidth requests ( reports ) from the attached cpes as well as @xmath10 gate messages for the onu to forward to the attached @xmath10 cpes .",
    "we denote @xmath11 for the downstream transmission time of a gate message on the pon and @xmath12 for the downstream transmission time of a gate message on a dsl .",
    "moreover , we denote @xmath13 for the size [ bit ] of the upstream transmission window granted to cpe @xmath3 . by controlling the transmission of each dsl cpe ,",
    "the pon olt can exercise tight control over the magnitude of buffering that occurs at the drop - point .      in onu :",
    "cpe polling , the olt can apply any of the existing onu grant sizing strategies  @xcite to assign each onu an upstream transmission window duration ( grant size ) according to the reported bandwidth requests . in turn",
    ", the olt allocates a given onu grant size to grants to the attached cpes and other ( non - xdsl traffic ) at the onu .",
    "when making a grant sizing decision for an onu , the olt knows the bandwidth requests from all cpes attached to the onu .",
    "thus , the olt can employ any of the grant sizing approaches requiring knowledge of all bandwidth requests , i.e. , so - called offline approaches  @xcite , for sizing the cpe grants .",
    "as specified by the vdsl standard  @xcite , ethernet frames are encapsulated in a continuous stream of packet transfer mode ( ptm ) 65  byte codewords , see  ( * ? ? ? *",
    "annex n ) .",
    "each codeword contains one synchronization byte for every 64 bytes of data as well as control characters and idle data bytes .",
    "the vdsl cpe under study has been designed to suppress ptm codewords that contain all idle data bytes .",
    "however , ethernet frames can be encapsulated in ptm codewords that contain idle data bytes .",
    "the number of bytes to be transmitted to release a certain number of intended ethernet frames from the cpe depends on how the individual ethernet frames expand within the ptm codewords due to the inclusion of both ptm control characters and idle data bytes . modeling the exact number of bytes consumed by ptm codewords for a given number of ethernet frames requires knowledge of the individual ethernet frame sizes .",
    "that information is not available at the olt .",
    "therefore , we estimate the cpe grant size to accommodate the pon grant size with one synchronization byte for every 64 data bytes .",
    "we then assume one extra codeword to contain control characters and idle data bytes .",
    "due to the cpe grant size estimation , it is possible that the cpe grant is too small and therefore does not allow all of the ptm codewords containing the intended ethernet frames to be transmitted . in this case , an intended ethernet frame will only be partially received at the onu with the other part left at the cpe . with the next grant ,",
    "the remainder of this ethernet frame will be transmitted , along with the other ethernet frames intended for that grant .",
    "the resulting extra ethernet frame at the onu will not be accommodated by the current pon upstream grant . that ethernet frame becomes residue that stays at the drop point until it can be serviced in the next pon upstream grant .",
    "we also note that if we increased our cpe grant size estimate , then the grant would be too large and result in one or more ethernet frames left as residue at the onu because the pon upstream grant would not accommodate them .    in the subsequent analysis of onu cpe polling in this section  [ onucpe_poll : sec ] ,",
    "we neglect the drop point buffer residue . the simulations in section  [ sec : experiment ] consider the full xdsl and pon framing details and thus include the effects of the residue .",
    "we note that due to neglecting the residue , the pon delay analysis in section  [ pondelay : sec ] is approximate .",
    "however , we emphasize that the timing ( scheduling ) analyses in sections  [ cpesepspec : sec ] and  [ onucpemux : sec ] are accurate for the grant sizes determined by the olt .      in this subsection",
    "we examine the timing of the polling of a single cpe @xmath3 attached to an onu .",

    ", we must consider that the last bit of a packet must have arrived at the drop - point device from a cpe before the first bit of that same packet can be transmitted by the onu to the olt .",
    "we let @xmath14 denote the maximum packet size [ in bit ] and conservatively consider maximum size packets in the following analysis . focusing on the last packet of the cpe upstream transmission",
    ", we note that the end of the last packet , i.e. , the end of the cpe upstream transmission must be received by the drop - point before the onu can forward this last packet over the pon to the olt .",
    "we denote @xmath16 for the time instant when the cpe upstream transmission begins to arrive ( and occupy buffer space ) at the drop point , i.e. , @xmath28    after complete receipt of the last packet at time instant @xmath29 the onu can immediately transmit this last packet to the olt .",
    "we denote @xmath19 for the time instant when the last packet is completely transmitted by the onu , i.e. , when the cpe transmission stops to occupy buffer in the drop - point . clearly , @xmath30 the end of the last packet reaches the olt after the pon propagation delay , resulting in the cycle duration @xmath31 .    for the last packet to be able to start onu transmission at time instant @xmath32 ,",
