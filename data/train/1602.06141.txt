    "it is remarkable that the occurrence of the long wave - short wave resonance is connected to a disappearance of the modulational instability of the upper branch : as one can see from fig .",

    "this corresponds to the so - called lighthill - benjamin - feir criterion of modulational instability @xcite , which can be given the following intuitive interpretation : one assumes that a wave - train of finite amplitude @xmath250 corresponds to the renormalized dispersion relation @xmath257 the initial carrier wave at angular frequency @xmath248 and wave - vector @xmath51 may decay into two side bands according to the following process : @xmath258 where @xmath254 as given by enforces the energy and momentum conservation relations in the process , as can be checked analytically ( by an expansion in @xmath254 ) and is graphically demonstrated in fig .",

    "an expansion of @xmath265 at second order in the vicinity of @xmath51 shows that ( i ) the white point is the middle of the two black points ( and this automatically implies momentum and energy conservation in the process ) and that ( ii ) @xmath254 defined by the above construction verifies eq .  .",

    "[ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is appropriate to discuss if the different regimes identified in table [ table1 ] can be reached with current days experimental realization of spin - orbit coupled becs . the references @xcite consider the two states @xmath413 of a @xmath414rb bose - einstein condensate in the @xmath415 hyperfine structure .",
    "the @xmath416-wave scattering lengths are ( in units of the bohr radius ) @xmath417 and @xmath418 .",
    "since @xmath419 the simplifying assumption of a common value of the nonlinear coupling @xmath420 in is legitimate ( in this expression @xmath421 is the angular frequency corresponding to a tight harmonic radial trapping which ensures a quasi-1d behavior of the condensate @xcite ) . besides , if necessary",
    ", the present formalism can be extended to take into account the fact that @xmath422 and @xmath423 are not equal , see ref .",
    "note that the recoil energy is typically @xmath424  khz ( it is monitored by the wavelength and the relative angle of the raman lasers ) , whereas the interaction energy @xmath425 is of order @xmath426  khz ( it depends on the value of the radial trapping frequency and on the linear atomic density ) .",
    "one has @xmath427 , hence @xmath428 , and it seems from the discussion in the beginning of section [ gardner_regime ] that one can never reach the interesting regime where @xmath358 and where the nonlinear modulations of an excitation formed in the lower branch is described by gardner equation .",
    "however , @xmath429 is small ( since @xmath430 and @xmath431 are so close ) and , as explained in appendix [ app2 ] , generalizing the present approach by taking into account the small detuning @xmath432 from the raman resonance  not considered in the main text ",
    "one can show that , even with a positive @xmath429 , it is possible to reach a regime where the nonlinearity coefficient @xmath386 cancels by correctly fixing the value of @xmath432 .",
    "however , for keeping the discussion simple we will only consider here the case of a small negative @xmath429 .",
    "the more relevant case of a small positive @xmath429 in the presence of a small detuning is presented in appendix [ app2 ] .",

    "we recall however that for the system to remain in the good side of the boundary between phase iii and phase ii one needs to impose @xmath434 , which is verified by the above choice of @xmath305 , but not by a large extend .",
    "hence , one can reach a regime where the lower excitation branch is described by gardner dynamics , but this is obtained at the expense of getting close to the phase iii  phase ii boundary .",
    "away from this boundary , the lower branch has a kdv dynamics .",
    "in the present paper we have described how nonlinearity affects the dynamics of elementary excitations of a coherently coupled bose - einstein condensate .",
    "excitations in the upper branch of the spectrum display a modulational instability .",
    "as discussed in the text , this instability is stabilized by a low wave  short wave resonance : the momentum imparted by the wave train formed in the upper branch to excitations in the lower branch has a stabilizing effect when it has the same sign that the velocity of the wave train .",
    "we also showed that the system can experience second harmonic generation , and that this mechanism may be inhibited by symmetry effects ( namely by the complete separation between density and polarization modes which occurs when @xmath39 ) .",
    "excitations in the lower branch are stable . in the long wave length limit",
    "they are affected by nonlinear effects in a manner which can generically be described by kdv dynamics .",
    "for some specific configuration of the system s parameters ( close to the phase ii ",
    "phase iii boundary ) one has to use gardner equation instead .",
    "it is interesting to note that the gardner regime is realized in the lower branch which is a mode mainly corresponding to density waves : hence the wide range of nonlinear excitations of gardner s equation ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) can be generated by means of a simple scalar potential , whereas for non - coherently coupled two component condensates , where the gardner regime is obtained for a polarization mode @xcite , this can be achieved only thanks to a polarization potential @xcite .",

    "in this appendix we rapidly present the treatment of the lower excitation branch for a spin - orbit coupled condensate ( @xmath194 ) in the case where the system experiences a finite detuning @xmath442 from the raman resonance .",

    "one has now @xmath445 where @xmath446 is a variational parameter . minimizing the energy per particle one obtains @xcite",
    "@xmath447 the same result can be obtained in a different manner , by using dynamical arguments : one keeps @xmath446 as a free parameter , and one studies the linear excitations of the system . by demanding that the system is dynamically stable , i.e. , that the frequency of elementary excitations remains real , one obtains the result .    in the presence of a finite @xmath432 ,",
    "the ground state value @xmath448 is no longer exactly equal to @xmath449 as in and @xmath450 is not given by eq .  .",
    "instead one has [ from and ] @xmath451 and @xmath452 eq .",
    "determines the value of @xmath448 .",
    "depending on the system s parameters it has either four or two solutions . in the first case",
    ", only one corresponds to the minimum of the energy per particle ( the other is the maximum ) and the system can be considered to be in the single minimum phase iii . in the second case",
    "there are two non equivalent minima and the system is in phase ii . in the regime where @xmath453 is larger than @xmath454 and where @xmath455 , one can show that the boundary between these two regimes corresponds to @xmath456 in the case @xmath457 the solution of is @xmath33 if @xmath458 and corresponds to the standard transition line between phases ii and iii which is reproduced in figure  [ fig.phases ] .",
    "it is important to stress that in the presence of a finite detuning @xmath432 the second order phase transition from phase iii to phase ii strictly speaking disappears because the system does not cross any phase transition line when @xmath305 varies @xcite .",
    "for instance , the velocity of sound vanishes at the transition region when @xmath457 ( cf .",
    "eq .  ) , whereas it remains finite when @xmath459 ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig.sound-omega ] ) . also , when @xmath459 , even in what has been identified above as the single minimum phase , the system has a small spin polarization and condensates into a state with a small but finite momentum .",
    "the matrix @xmath335 of eq . now reads @xmath460 where , for gaining space , we have written @xmath461 and @xmath462 instead of @xmath463 and @xmath464 . in formula",
    "the sound velocity @xmath168 is not given by : it now depends on @xmath432 .",
    "it can be determined through the computation of the dispersion relation in the system , or more simply just by imposing the cancellation of @xmath465 . for non zero @xmath432 the ground state breaks galilean invariance and in our 1d configuration one obtains two velocities of sound , one for each direction of propagation .",
    "the first one  denoted as @xmath466  corresponds to waves propagating in the same direction as the ground state ( for which @xmath467 ) and the other ( @xmath468 ) propagates in the opposite direction .",
    "a typical case is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig.sound-omega ] .",
    "note that this figure is interrupted at low values of @xmath305 in order to prevent the system to get into phase i.     as a function of @xmath305 .",
    "the system s parameter are are @xmath306 , @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "when @xmath457 , the transition from phase iii to phase ii occurs at @xmath469 , and above @xmath470 one is in phase iii with a single sound velocity . when @xmath459 one can show that @xmath471 and @xmath472",
    "this is the reason why the sign of @xmath432 is not specified in the figure . ]",
    "following the procedure exposed in section [ kdvregime ] one can determine the form of the kdv equation which describes how long wavelength excitations propagating along the lower branch of the spectrum are affected by nonlinearity when @xmath459 .",
    "in this case the nonlinear parameter @xmath386 is different from the value given by expression ( which corresponds to the @xmath457 case ) .",
    "we do not write the explicit form of @xmath386 when @xmath459 because it is too cumbersome . instead , we rather plot @xmath386 as a function of @xmath305 for different values of @xmath432 in figure  [ fig.gamma1-delta ] .     as a function of @xmath432 for several values of @xmath305 .",
    "the system s parameter are @xmath306 , @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "the curve is discontinuous when @xmath473 because in this case the system meets a first order phase transition at @xmath457 . for the present choice of parameters",
    "@xmath474 can be canceled by changing the value of @xmath432 when @xmath475 or 2.5 , but not when @xmath65 . ]    as for the sound velocity , the value of the nonlinear coefficient depends of the direction of propagation of the wave .",
    "we denote as @xmath474 ( @xmath476 ) the value of @xmath386 corresponding to wave - trains propagating in the same ( the opposite ) direction than the momentum of the ground state .",
    "one has the symmetry relation @xmath477 . when @xmath478 the nonlinear coefficient is discontinuous at @xmath457 , as @xmath448 and @xmath446 are , and this corresponds to the crossing of the first order transition line in the plane @xmath479 @xcite .",
    "one sees in the figure that there exist values of @xmath432 for which the nonlinear coefficient cancels even for @xmath480 , provided @xmath305 is not too large .",
    "it is important to notice that this cancellation of @xmath386 is obtained for a positive @xmath429 , contrarily to what occurs when @xmath457 .",
    "note however that for @xmath65 the non - linear coefficient can not be canceled by imposing a finite value of the detuning @xmath432 .",
    "when @xmath386 cancels , the effective nonlinear dynamics of the system is no longer described by a kdv equation , but rather by a gardner equation .",
