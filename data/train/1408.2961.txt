    "in recent years , tailored lattice systems of ( artificial ) atoms have turned into a thriving field of experimental and theoretical research across many different subdisciplines of quantum optics .",
    "still , the typical questions and problems addressed in the context of atomic lattice systems interacting with light often relate to basic and generic properties .",
    "physical realizations of artificial atomic lattice systems cover a wide range of technologies with which light ",
    "matter interactions can be studied . to name just a few , these include cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite , fiber - based settings @xcite , atom  cavity networks and on - chip photonics @xcite , or cold polar molecules @xcite .",
    "one particular line of research involves static and dynamic properties of the system in the few - excitation subspace  @xcite .",
    "in particular few - excitation eigenstates in one dimension are also connected to the topic of more `` exotic '' eigenstates such as two - body bound states on a lattice @xcite .",
    "these represent a nice example for how a `` historical '' prediction originally put forward by bethe @xcite is investigated today by means of cutting - edge experimental techniques @xcite .",
    "however , oftentimes , related experiments are very demanding in that they require _ in situ _ tuning of parameters and/or rely on single - site manipulation .",
    "this motivates alternative approaches such as the coupling to a probing light field  @xcite .",
    "essentially , the key question here is about how much information on the eigenstates of an atomic lattice system can be inferred from the scattered light in the far field when the system is probed optically .",
    "( color online ) general structure of the analysis . ( a ) shows the basic setup .",
    "the two - level atoms ( bare transition energy @xmath0 ) are arranged on a one - dimensional lattice ( lattice constant @xmath1 ) along the @xmath2 direction .",
    "the atoms dipole moments are uniformly aligned and lie in the @xmath3-@xmath2 plane ( in this sketch , we have exemplarily chosen an angle between the dipole moments and the atomic chain of @xmath4 ) .",
    "the whole chain is coupled to a common reservoir indicated by the shading . in ( b ) , the first considered pump - field configuration is shown , with an incoherent pump rate @xmath5 applied at an excitation angle @xmath6 .",
    "the pump s electric field polarization vector lies in the @xmath3-@xmath2 plane and is perpendicular to the driving field s wave vector @xmath7 . to separate the scattered field from the driving field , a detection out - of - plane ( , in the @xmath8-@xmath2 plane )",
    "could be performed .",
    "( c ) two - pump setup with excitation angles @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the ratio of the driving fields pump rates is @xmath11.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    a recent addition to the zoo of lattice systems arises from the emerging field of x - ray quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "nuclear transitions driven , e.g. , by synchrotron light  @xcite , are a particularly promising implementation , fueled by a number of recent theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite works .",
    "typically , the nuclei are embedded in a solid state target , which may exhibit a crystalline structure .",
    "facilitated by the mbauer effect  @xcite , suitable nuclei such as @xmath12fe have the additional benefit of offering recoil - less absorption or emission of light .",
    "nanostructuring of the target , e.g. , into thin - film waveguide structures  @xcite or nano - wires  @xcite , allows one to explore lower - dimensional geometries .",
    "furthermore , in state - of - the - art experiments , source limitations naturally restrict the nuclei to the low - excitation subspace .",
    "finally , since the nuclei are probed via scattered light observed in the far field , again the question arises , how much this light reveals about the system .",
    "motivated by this question , here , we study the far - field signatures that emerge in the collective emission from dipole  dipole coupled two - level atoms on a one - dimensional lattice ( see ) . to this end",
    ", we develop an analytical framework reminiscent of spin physics , which allows us to discuss the relevant physical mechanisms in a broader context .",
    "we start by deriving the dissipative few - excitation eigenstates of the coupled atoms subject to a common reservoir .",
    "next , we determine the collective dipole moments and related branching ratios for transitions between the eigenstates of the atomic chain . as a key result of this analysis , we identify a connection between the momentum distribution of the collective atomic states wavefunctions and these branching ratios .",
    "this analysis further enables us to determine the relevant level space for the spontaneous emission from an excited eigenstate , as well as under the influence of weak incoherent driving fields .",
    "we then study the dynamics within this relevant level space by means of a master equation .",
    "relating the electric far field operator to the collective atomic eigenbasis , we can evaluate far - field observables such as the emitted intensity , the emission spectrum , and an intensity correlation function .",
    "this approach is of interest since it does not require single - atom addressability or manipulation techniques , and it is compatible with recent experiments in nuclear quantum optics .    in our analysis , we particularly contrast the two extreme cases of non - interacting and strongly interacting atoms . for the latter case ,",
    "the two - excitation submanifold comprises not only scattering states but also two - body bound states of atomic excitation .",
    "we further find that the two cases lead to different dynamics , involving characteristic branching ratios between the eigenstates .",
    "these differences also manifest themselves in all optical far - field observables . as an application",
    ", we discuss different driving field setups to characterize the collective eigenstates wavefunctions via the scattered light . finally , as an outlook",
    ", we calculate second - order correlation functions of the light in the far field .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in",
    ", we introduce our model and discuss it s static properties .",
    "furthermore , we determine the electric far - field operator in the collective atomic eigenbasis and define our observables . based on a lindblad master equation , we analyze in the angle - dependent far - field pattern emerging from the spontaneous emission of the system s eigenstates . in , we discuss the far - field properties in the presence of external driving fields .",

    "photons can be exchanged between nearby atoms via the common electromagnetic reservoir by virtue of dipole  dipole coupling .",

    "explicit calculation reveals that @xmath126 where the quantity @xmath127 ( for details , we refer to ) can be interpreted as a collective dipole moment .",
    "this quantity ( which will be discussed later in this section ) can be used to define the branching ratio @xmath128 for the decay @xmath129 via @xmath130 in the second last step , we have exploited that the coupling strength is practically constant over the spectral range that corresponds to the wavenumbers involved .",

    "in particular , we started in with the static properties of the underlying model system .",

    "we then showed that characteristic key quantities such as the collective dipole moments , branching ratios , and , most importantly , the momentum distribution of the collective states relative wavefunctions are intimately linked to each other .",
    "moreover , an expansion of the operator for the electric far field in terms of the collective atomic eigenbasis allowed us to construct operators for the emitted intensity , the emission spectrum , and an intensity correlation function .    in , we continued with the angle - dependent far - field pattern emerging from the spontaneous emission of the system s eigenstates .",
    "we especially discussed the characteristic differences of the light emitted by two - body scattering states and bound states , arguing that the emission patterns can serve as a distinct fingerprint for identifying and proofing the existence of certain eigenstates on the lattice .",
    "in the course of the discussion , we also contrasted the differences between the two cases of non - interacting atoms and strong atom  atom interactions .",

    ", we were able to extract signatures for the existence of a two - body bound state from the steady - sate intensity and emission spectrum in the far field .",
    "still , this scheme failed to reveal detailed information on the characteristics of the involved scattering states .",
    "as another approach to inferring information on the collective atomic eigenstates from the far field , we therefore extended the scheme to a special two - pump setup , where detectors were chosen such that they exclusively detect photons from driven transitions . with regard to the detected steady - state intensity and emission spectrum",
    ", the hilbert space accessible to the external fields now not only results in a distinct signature for the existence of a bound state . unlike for a single pump",
    ", we were also able to identify features that stem from the scattering states momentum distribution and which are related to the decay channels which we termed `` background fluorescence '' and `` direct fluorescence '' .",
    "however , due to the spectral overlap of scattering states with different relative wavenumbers it is not possible to extract the momentum distribution of a single scattering state and we were instead left with far - field observables resulting from the superposition of different scattering states .",
    "moreover , we also contrasted the results for the two cases of non - interacting atoms and strong atom ",
    "atom interactions , which exhibit very different far - field patterns .",
    "in addition to that , we showed that in the framework of such a two - pump setup , an angle - dependent intensity correlation function represents another tool for analyzing the scattering states properties for both interacting and non - interacting atoms .",
    "future studies might include the dynamics induced by one or more coherent driving fields , requiring a description beyond the rate equations utilized in this work . in the context of coherent fields , an analysis of how interference effects modify the far - field emission patterns discussed in this paper would be highly interesting .",
    "this would also address whether these signatures may reveal additional or complimentary information on the properties of the collective few - excitation wavefunction .",
    "besides that , going from weak driving fields to higher pump powers would in principle open up a way to probe the more complicated hilbert space beyond two - excitations , which is still largely unexplored in detail . finally , our analysis provides a promising approach to the theoretical modeling and understanding of recent experiments in nuclear quantum optics on a microscopic level .",
