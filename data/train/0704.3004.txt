    "a goal of contemporary hadron physics is to relate the confined quark and gluon degrees of freedom and parameters related to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) to the comprehensive hadronic spectrum .",
    "lattice qcd and chiral effective field theory are suitable tools to accomplish this and other goals in exploring the structure of low - energy qcd and properties of hadrons .",
    "another - though not so direct - but successful approach is given by qcd sum rules , originally formulated by shifman , vainshtein and zakharov @xcite to describe masses of light vector mesons for example @xcite .",
    "the method since then gained attention in numerous applications , e.  g.  to calculate masses and couplings of low - lying hadrons , magnetic moments , etc .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "its particular meaning is that numerous hadronic observables are directly linked to a set of fundamental qcd quantities , the condensates and moments of parton distributions .",
    "hadrons are excitations from the ground state .",
    "changes in this state are expected to reflect in a change of hadronic properties , especially in spectral functions and moments thereof related , e.g. , to masses of hadrons .",
    "measurements of  mass modifications  of hadrons in a finite temperature , strongly interacting medium or when situated inside nuclear matter , that means embedded in a bulk of protons and neutrons and baryonic and mesonic resonances , then probe the qcd vacuum ( cf .",
    "@xcite for an experimental overview ) .",
    "the properties of the qcd ground state are mapped to and quantified by a number of condensates , like intrinsic material constants , which partially carry information on symmetry features of the theory . besides the chiral condensate @xmath0 , up to mass dimension 6 the gluon condensate @xmath1",
    ", the mixed quark - gluon condensate @xmath2 , the triple gluon condensate @xmath3 and structures of the form @xmath4 contribute in vacuum .",
    "( @xmath5 denotes all possible structures formed by dirac and gell - mann matrices . )",
    "we emphasize here the specific role of the latter class of hitherto poorly known condensates , the four - quark condensates .    within the realm of hadron spectroscopy the explanation of the actual numerical value of the nucleon mass is crucial as ingredient for understanding macroscopic matter .",
    "the nucleon represents as carrier of mass the hard core of visible matter in the universe and thus is an important source for gravitation .",
    "our investigations here are to be considered in line with previous investigations  @xcite for nucleons inside cold nuclear matter , which are also discussed in  @xcite and continuously explored in  @xcite .",
    "the possible extension to further effects at finite temperatures lies beyond the present scope .",
    "an advantage of applying qcd sum rules is that effects of small finite baryon density @xmath6 are described systematically by the change of condensates and the advent of new structures which are absent at zero density .",
    "for the nucleon an important dependence of self - energies on four - quark condensates was found .",
    "comparisons with results of chiral effective field theory  @xcite , where nucleon self - energies show strong cancellation effects ( i.  e.  they change with the same magnitude but have opposite signs ) suggest that the relevant four - quark condensates should be weakly density dependent  @xcite . for the @xmath7 meson , however , we recently deduced in  @xcite evidence for a significant density dependence of a particular combination of four - quark condensates appearing there .",
    "this was based on the experimentally found shift of the spectral strength of @xmath7 to lower invariant masses inside nuclear matter , as measured by the cb - taps collaboration  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will spell out explicitly the four - quark condensates in nucleon sum rules in medium , which up to now are usually given in the factorization approximation or are determined by special models .",
    "so one can directly distinguish the four - quark condensate structures in sum rules for vector mesons and baryons .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the operator product expansion for the nucleon and the hadronic model to write out the qcd sum rule equations .",
    "the four - quark condensates are discussed in section 3 where an exhaustive list is presented and relations among these condensates are given .",
    "afterwards we present a numerical analysis of their influences in a nucleon sum rule evaluation and compare to other results ( section 4 ) .",

    "combining fierz rearrangement of the dirac contractions of pure four - quark operators with the rearrangement of the color structures , one derives the transformation equation @xmath126 which relates the two different color combinations .",
    "this transformation can be brought in matrix form @xmath127 with @xmath128 @xmath129 we emphasize that the inverse transformation @xmath130 exists .",
    "however , structures for baryon sum rules typically are combinations of two color contractions , dictated by eq .  , which form components of the vector @xmath131 the matrix @xmath132 has the fivefold eigenvalues 0 and 2 , and the corresponding eigenspaces both have dimension 5 , especially the kernel of @xmath132 spanned by the eigenvectors to eigenvalue 0 .",
    "the fact that the kernel contains more than the null vector implies that @xmath132 has no inverse .",
    "the transformation of this equation into the basis of eigenvectors yields a new vector @xmath133 where 5 elements are to be zero .",
    "written in components of @xmath134 these relations are @xmath135 the first three conditions occur already in the vacuum set , the latter two ones are additional in the medium case .",
    "of course , the conditions can be written differently , e.g. , the second and third line may be conveniently combined to @xmath136 for applications .",
    "an alternative derivation of these relations is presented in appendix  [ ap : constraints ] .",
    "the relations  ( [ eq : fqcconstraints1])-([eq : fqcconstraints5 ] ) have two important consequences : firstly , they allow to simplify pure flavor four - quark condensates in baryon sum rules ; secondly , since eq .",
    "( [ eq : fqcmatrixequation ] ) can not be inverted , they forbid a direct translation from pure flavor four - quark condensates in baryon sum rules at the order @xmath137 to those which occur e.g.  in sum rules for light vector mesons in the order @xmath138 .      we have now provided all prerequisites to specify the four - quark condensates which occur in the sum rule  ( [ eq : exactfullsumrule ] ) .",
    "the full expressions for the four - quark condensates in the order @xmath137 , abbreviated in   so far symbolically , are @xmath139 @xmath140 @xmath141 here , additional polynomials which express the mixing of interpolating fields are @xmath142 these expressions extend the non - factorized four - quark condensates for the nucleon in vacuum listed in  @xcite .      up to now we have introduced all possible four - quark condensates in the light quark sector and written out explicitly the structures which appear in the nucleon sum rule . in such a way the sum rule equations of the type employed , e.g.  in  @xcite , are equipped with complete four - quark condensates .",
    "we evaluate now the sum rule equations with the focus on these particular combinations of four - quark condensates .",
    "so we are faced with the common problem of the poor knowledge of four - quark condensates . usually assuming the vacuum saturation hypothesis or resorting to the large @xmath115 limit the four - quark condensates are factorized into products of condensates with two quark operators .",
    "the factorization of four - quark condensates allows to set the proper units , however its reliability is a matter of debate . for instance , @xcite state that the four - quark condensates in the nucleon sum rule are the expectation value of a chirally invariant operator , while @xmath143 is not invariant and thus a substitution by the factorized form would be inconsistent with the chiral perturbation theory expression for the nucleon self - energy .",
    "the four - quark condensates breaking chiral symmetry might have a meaningful connection to the chiral condensate but for the chirally invariant structures such a closer relation to @xmath0 is not clear  @xcite .",
    "moreover , for nucleon sum rules at finite temperature @xmath144 ( and vanishing chemical potential ) it was argued in  @xcite that the four - quark condensates are @xmath144 independent quite different from the behavior of @xmath145 which is why a naive factorization would lead to artificial temperature effects in the nucleon mass .    for numerical purposes",
    "it is convenient to correct the values deduced from factorization by factors @xmath146 and examine the effect of these correction factors on predictions from qcd sum rules . in this section",
    "the four - quark condensates classified so far in general are spelled out and the parametrization with a set of quantities @xmath146 is defined . in doing",
    "so one includes a density dependent factor @xmath147 in the factorized result @xmath148 where @xmath146 and the following parametrization depend on the specific condensate structure . in linear density approximation",
    "this product ansatz obtains contributions both from the expansion @xmath149 with @xmath150 and from the linearized , factorized four - quark condensate expression @xmath151 if @xmath152 , then @xmath153 recovers the usual factorization , which means the four - quark condensate behaves like the product of two two - quark condensates ; @xmath154 represents a stronger density dependence with respect to the factorization and vice versa .",
    "inserting both expansions one can also describe the total density dependence of the condensates by the combination @xmath155 , @xmath156 such that for @xmath157 the condensate is ( in first order ) independent of density . for condensates with vanishing @xmath158 or @xmath159 in factorization",
    "we choose @xmath160 and @xmath161 as scale to study deviations from zero and denote these instances by @xmath162 .",
    "the classification of possible four - quark condensates is collected together with the specific @xmath146 parametrization in tabs .",
    "[ tab : listnonmixingfqc ] and  [ tab : listmixingfqc ] .",
    "the condensates which contain only one flavor are listed in tab .",

    "parity and time reversal invariance only @xmath163  @xmath164 dirac and lorentz scalar four quark operators remained in vacuum ( medium ) .",
    "further , these structures carry color indices and must be projected on colorless objects for which there are two ways .",
    "however , since the same flavors occur , both color combinations can be alternatively rearranged via fierz transformation .",
    "hence , there are only @xmath163  @xmath164 independent @xmath146 parameter sets in the tab .",
    "[ tab : listnonmixingfqc ] , although both color alternatives are listed .",
    "the parameter sets with indices @xmath165 are related by the transformation  .      here",
    "the condensates containing two quark operator pairs are distinguished by flavor .",
    "the numbering is as for the pure flavor structures .",
    "however , the conversion of the two color contractions is not possible due to different flavors . compared to the non - flavor mixing case the missing exchange symmetry of @xmath166 contractions due to different flavors allows additional placements of dirac matrices and thus leads to 4 additional condensate structures in medium ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : listmixingfqc ] ) .",
    "therefore , 10 ( 24 ) flavor - mixed four quark condensates and thus @xmath146 parameter pairs appear in vacuum ( medium ) .      hence , there exist in medium \\{vacuum } for @xmath167 flavors without flavor symmetry taken into account @xmath168 \\{@xmath169 } independent four - quark condensates being lorentz invariant expectation values of hermitian products of four quark operators constrained by time and parity reversal invariance .",
    "symmetry under flavor rotation reduces these numbers to @xmath170 \\{@xmath171 } , respectively .",
    "finally note that these are also the numbers of necessary @xmath172 parameters . since the four - quark condensates in operator product expansions obtained from the medium projections in the limit of vanishing baryon density @xmath6 should coincide with the vacuum result , this leads by contraction of vacuum and medium projections of four - quark condensates to the relations @xmath173 , which have already been included in tabs .",
    "[ tab : listnonmixingfqc ] and  [ tab : listmixingfqc ] .",
