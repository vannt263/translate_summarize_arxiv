    "the study of neutron - proton pairing especially in the t=0 channel is a particularly prominent topic these days . while the number of journal articles are far too numerous to reference one might begin to make some headway into the varied approaches by starting from the references found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in",
    "so doing one will find a field of study filled with disagreement and occasionally strife .",
    "the approach here is to study the effects of the t=0 portion of the neutron - proton interaction by removing it altogether . in this way it is hoped that we can understand where in nuclear structure",
    "this portion of the interaction is found to play a large role .",
    "this would in turn suggest where t=0 pairing might most clearly reveal its presence or absence . in this work",
    "we will examine the yrast spectra of the even - even @xmath4 nuclei @xmath0ti,@xmath1ti , @xmath2cr , and @xmath5 with two sets of interaction parameters .",
    "first we have the full fpd6 interaction  @xcite , and then we use the same interaction for the two - body t=1 matrix elements while setting all the t=0 two - body interaction matrix elements to zero . we shall denote this interaction as t0fpd6 .",
    "( this modification of an effective interaction is along the same lines of that used by satula et al . to examine wigner energies a few years ago  @xcite . )",
    "we have used this modification of fpd6 in the past to study a variety of things and in particular the full fp spectrum of @xmath0ti  @xcite .",
    "we found to our surprise and to the surprise of many others that one could obtain a fairly decent spectrum for the levels of @xmath0ti with the second interaction here labeled t0fpd6 .",
    "this is surprising because the t=0 interaction is by no means small .",
    "the only bound two nucleon system is the t=0 combination of two nucleons , the deuteron .",
    "moreover the largest valued matrix elements in the fpd6 interaction tend to be those in the t=0 channel .    with the one nucleus @xmath0ti shown in a full fp space calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite we have the first clue that the spectra of even - even nuclei are relatively insensitive to the t=0 two - body interaction matrix elements . to make this more conclusive however we need to examine more nuclei .",
    "we have expanded the examination of the even - even nuclei to those listed above .",
    "the sample we have chosen consists of nuclei with the same collective properties - ground state bands which have some rotational properties but are not extremely rotational .    also we now look at transition rates - perhaps these will prove more sensitive to the presence of t=0 two - body matrix elements than the spectra",
    ". this will be our interest in a few sections .",
    "it should be noted that in refs .",
    "@xcite a wide range of topics is addressed beyond the spectra of even - even nuclei .",
    "these topics include a partial dynamical symmetry that arises when one uses the t0fpd6 interaction in a single j shell for @xmath6sc and @xmath0ti . also while using the t0fpd6 interaction a subtle relationship between the t=@xmath7 states in @xmath6sc and t=@xmath8 states in @xmath6ca likewise between the the t=@xmath9 states in @xmath0ti and t=@xmath10 states in @xmath0ca .",
    "we also considered even - odd nuclei and addressed the topic of how the t=0 two - body matrix elements affect b(m1 ) transitions - both spin and orbital components , and gamow - teller transitions . in many cases the transition rates were very sensitive to the presence or absence of the t=0 matrix elements .",
    "this was especially the case for some orbital b(m1 ) s and the gamow - teller transitions .    here",
    "things will be kept simple and we focus on the spectra and b(e2 ) s of the yrast levels of selected even - even nuclei .",
    "we will examine the sensitivity of these observables on the t=0 two - body interaction matrix elements by setting them to zero and comparing the results thus obtained with those when the t=0 matrix elements are reintroduced .",
    "as mentioned in the introductions we perform calculations of even - even nuclei with and without the t=0 two - body matrix elements of the fpd6 interaction .",
    "thus each of the figures [ fig : first ] to [ fig : last ] corresponding to the nuclei @xmath0ti , @xmath1ti , @xmath2cr , and @xmath3cr will consist of three columns .",
    "the first column is the yrast spectra calculated with the full fpd6 interaction , the second column with the t0fpd6 interaction , and the third column shows the levels from experiment .",
    "we have previously discussed @xmath0ti so we will start with @xmath1ti , but before dissecting the details of the spectra , note the exceptional results in column 2 of figure [ fig : second ] . there",
    "we see that the results found when all the t=0 two - body interaction matrix elements are set to zero ( t0fpd6 ) in this complete fp calculation that the resulting spectra looks quite reasonable in comparison with both the full fpd6 and the known experimental levels .",
    "indeed it is difficult to choose between t0fpd6 and fpd6 as to which yields a better fit to experiment .",
    "a closer look shows some differences .",
    "the odd spin excitation energies come down by about 1 mev when the t=0 matrix elements are set to zero .",
    "experimentally some odd spin excitation energies are known ( j=1@xmath11 and j=11@xmath11 ) but not as many as the even spins .",
    "the even spin spectrum is slightly more spread out in the full fpd6 calculation that is to say there is more of a tendency towards a rotational spectrum .",
    "the low lying spectrum is fit somewhat better with the full fpd6 interaction but there is a better fit to the j=14@xmath12 state using the t0fpd6 interaction .",
    "there are similar stories for @xmath2cr ( figures [ fig : third],[fig : fourth ] ) and @xmath3cr ( figures [ fig : fifth ] and [ fig : last ] ) .",
    "( these nuclei are of some interest as they both display backbends  @xcite-  @xcite . ) in @xmath0ti there is a bigger difference between fpd6 and t0fpd6 perhaps results from the greater deformation in @xmath0ti .",
    "as is the case for @xmath1ti and indeed many of the even - even nuclei in the region very few odd spin states are known .",
    "if these were to be made available experimentally it might be easier to demonstrate more clearly the preference between the full fpd6 or the modification t0fpd6 .",
    "the fact that one can even think of offering into competition an interaction in which all the t=0 two - body interaction matrix elements are set to zero is quite remarkable and perhaps a bit disturbing .",
    "the b(e2 ) rates for @xmath0ti , @xmath1ti , @xmath2cr , and @xmath3cr are listed in tables [ tab : first ] to [ tab : last ] .",
    "we allow up to t nucleons to be excited from the f@xmath13 shell to the rest of the fp shell .",
    "the values of t used are 4,3,2 , and 2 respectively .",
    "the effective charges used are the standard @xmath14 for the proton and @xmath15 for the neutron .",
    "the difference in the effective charges from 1 and 0 is intended to take care of the fact that the @xmath16 and higher excitations are not present in this model space .",
    "the results for fpd6 and t0fpd6 are shown .",
    "we also display the ratios of the results for the 2 interactions .",
    "for @xmath1ti the reintroduction of the t=0 two - body matrix elements causes an increase ( relative to t0fpd6 ) of a factor of two or more for all the transitions considered .",
    "so there is evidence here that the t=0 matrix elements contribute to the collectivity .",
    "this is not seen by looking at just the excitation energies in @xmath1ti where fpd6 and t0fpd6 give very similar results .    in @xmath2cr and",
    "@xmath3cr a more interesting behavior evolves . in t=2 calculations , the b(e2 ) s for low spin transitions",
    "get and enhancement with the reintroduction of the t=0 two - body matrix elements but for some of the higher spins we get a suppression .",
    "the suppression occurs when backbending occurs as in @xmath3cr in the j=8 @xmath17 10 transition .    in summary ,",
    "in studying the problem of the t=0 neutron - proton interaction in a nucleus , it may prove more fruitful to begin by removing this channel altogether as was done here by setting all the t=0 two - body matrix elements elements to zero and then reintroducing them , rather than adopting the more common approach of investigating the effects of a pairing interaction separated from the rest of the interaction .",
    "this may be especially true in the shell model as the suggestion has been made by satula and wyss that it may not be appropriate to separate out a pairing interaction from the rest of the hamiltonian in a shell model context  @xcite ."
