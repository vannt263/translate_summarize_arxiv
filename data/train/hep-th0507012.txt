    "despite recent progress @xcite , little is known about the ultimate configuration space of quantum gravity on which its nonperturbative dynamics takes place .",
    "this makes it difficult to decide which ( auxiliary ) configuration space to choose as starting point for a quantization . in the context of a path integral quantization of gravity ,",
    "the relevant question is which class of geometries one should be integrating over in the first place . setting aside the formidable difficulties in  doing the integral \" , there is a subtle balance between including too many geometries  such that the integral will simply fail to exist ( nonperturbatively ) in any meaningful way , even after renormalization  and including too few geometries , with the danger of not capturing a physically relevant part of the configuration space .    a time - honoured part of this discussion is the question of whether a sum over different spacetime topologies should be included in the gravitational path integral .",
    "the absence to date of a viable theory of quantum gravity in four dimensions has not hindered speculation on the potential physical significance of processes involving topology change ( for reviews , see @xcite ) . because such processes necessarily violate causality , they are usually considered in a euclidean setting where the issue does not arise .",
    "even if one believes that euclidean quantum gravity _ without _ a sum over topologies exists nonperturbatively as a fundamental theory of nature  something for which there is currently little evidence  , insisting on including such a sum makes it all the more difficult to perform the path integral and extract physical information from it .",
    "this happens because the number of ways in which one can cut and reglue a manifold to obtain manifolds with a different topology is very large and leads to uncontrollable divergences in the path integral .",
    "formal path integrals involving nontrivial topologies are either semiclassical and assume that a ( usually small and hand - picked ) class of such configurations dominates the path integral , without being able to check that they are indeed saddle points of a full , nonperturbative formulation ( see @xcite for a recent example ) , or otherwise postulate a separation of scales between the fundamental quantum excitations of the geometry and a ( larger ) length scale characteristic for the topology changes , for example , the size of wormholes @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of any evidence from nonperturbative approaches that would support either of these assumptions . on the contrary ,",
    "as already mentioned , path integrals including a sum over topologies tend not to exist at all .",
    "furthermore , as is clear from studies of both euclidean @xcite and lorentzian @xcite sums over geometries in two dimensions , once topology changes are allowed dynamically , they occur everywhere and at all scales .",
    "a new idea to tame the divergences associated with topology changes in the path integral was advanced in @xcite and implemented in a model of two - dimensional nonperturbative lorentzian quantum gravity .",
    "the idea is to include a sum over topologies , or over some subclass of topologies , in the state sum , but to restrict this class further by certain _ geometric _ ( as opposed to topological ) constraints .",
    "these constraints involve the causal ( and therefore lorentzian ) structure of the spacetimes and thus would have no analogue in a purely euclidean formulation . in the concrete two - dimensional model considered in @xcite , the path integral is taken over a geometrically distinguished class of spacetimes with arbitrary numbers of  wormholes \" , which violate causality only relatively mildly ( see also @xcite ) . as a consequence , the nonperturbative path integral turns out to be well defined .",
    "this is an extension of the central idea of the approach of causal dynamical triangulations , namely , to use physically motivated causality restrictions to make the gravitational path integral better behaved ( see @xcite for a review ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will present a complete analytical solution of the statistical model of two - dimensional lorentzian random geometries introduced in @xcite , whose starting point is a regularized sum over causal triangulated geometries _ including _ a sum over topologies . for a given genus ( i.e. number of ( worm)holes in the spacetime ) not all possible triangulated geometries",
    "are included in the sum , but only those which satisfy certain causality constraints .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this makes the statistical model well defined , and an unambiguous continuum limit is obtained by taking a suitable double - scaling limit of the two coupling constants of the model , the gravitational or newton s constant and the cosmological constant .",
    "the double - scaling limit presented here differs from the one found in @xcite , where only the partition function for a single spacetime strip was evaluated .",
    "we will show that when one includes the boundary lengths of the strip explicitly  as is necessary to obtain the full spacetime dynamics  the natural renormalization of newton s constant involves the boundary  cosmological \" coupling constants conjugate to the boundary lengths .",
    "although the holes we include exist only for an infinitesimal time , and we do not keep track of them explicitly in the states of the hilbert space , their integrated effect is manifest in the continuum hamiltonian of the resulting gravity theory .",
    "as we will see , their presence leads to an effective lowering of the cosmological constant and therefore represents a concrete and nonperturbative implementation of an idea much discussed in the late eighties in the context of the ill - defined continuum path integral formulation of euclidean quantum gravity ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly describe how a nonperturbative theory of two - dimensional lorentzian quantum gravity can be obtained by the method of causal dynamical triangulation ( cdt ) , and how a sum over topologies can be included . for a more detailed account of the construction of topology - changing spacetimes and the geometric reasoning behind the causality constraints we refer the reader to @xcite . the main result of sec .",
    "[ discretesection ] is the computation of the laplace transform of the one - step propagator of the discrete model for arbitrary boundary geometries . in sec .",
    "[ continuumsection ] we make a scaling ansatz for the coupling constants and show that just one of the choices for the scaling of newton s constant leads to a new and physically sensible continuum theory .",
    "we calculate the corresponding quantum hamiltonian and its spectrum , as well as the full propagator of the theory . using these results",
    ", we compute several observables of the continuum theory in sec .",
    "[ sec_observ ] , most importantly , the expectation value of the number of holes and its spacetime density . in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] , we summarize our results and draw a number of conclusions . in appendix",
    "a , we discuss the properties of alternative scalings for newton s constant which were discarded in the main text .",
    "this also establishes a connection with a previous attempt @xcite to generalize the original lorentzian model without topology changes . in appendix b",
    ", we calculate the spacetime density of holes from a single infinitesimal spacetime strip .",
    "our aim is to calculate the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional gravitational path integral @xmath0 e^{i      s(g_{\\mu\\nu})}\\ ] ] nonperturbatively by using the method of causal dynamical triangulations ( cdt ) .. the sum in ( [ contpi ] ) denotes the inclusion in the path integral of a specific , causally preferred class of fluctuations of the manifold topology . the action @xmath1 consists of the usual einstein - hilbert curvature term and a cosmological constant term .",
    "since we work in two dimensions , the integrated curvature term is proportional to the euler characteristic @xmath2 of the spacetime manifold , where @xmath3 denotes the genus ( i.e. the number of handles or holes ) and @xmath4 the number of boundary components .",
    "explicitly , the action reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the inverse newton s constant and @xmath7 the cosmological constant ( with dimension of inverse length squared ) .    just like in the original cdt model @xcite ( which from now on we will also refer to as the  pure \" model , i.e. without topology changes )",
    ", we will first regularize the path integral ( [ contpi ] ) by a sum over piecewise flat two - dimensional spacetimes , whose flat building blocks are identical minkowskian triangles , all with one space - like edge of squared length @xmath8 and two time - like edges of squared length @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a real positive constant .",
    "the cdt path integral takes the form of a sum over triangulations , with each triangulation consisting of a sequence of spacetime strips of height @xmath11 in the time direction .",
    "a single such strip is a set of @xmath12 triangles pointing up and @xmath13 triangles pointing down ( figure [ figure01 ] ) .",
    "because the geometry has a sliced structure , one can easily wick - rotate it to a triangulated manifold of euclidean signature by analytically continuing the parameter @xmath10 to a real negative value @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we will set @xmath14 in evaluating the regularized , real and wick - rotated version of the path integral ( [ contpi ] ) .",
    "$ ] of two spacetime strips of a triangulated two - dimensional spacetime contributing to the regularized path integral without topology changes.,width=480 ]    in the pure cdt model the one - dimensional spatial slices of constant proper time @xmath15 are usually chosen as circles , resulting in cylindrical spacetime geometries . for our present purposes , we will enlarge this class of geometries by allowing the genus to be variable .",
    "we define the sum over topologies by performing surgery moves directly on the triangulations to obtain regularized versions of higher - genus manifolds @xcite .",
    "they are generated by adding tiny wormholes that connect two regions of the same spacetime strip .",
    "starting from a regular strip of topology @xmath16\\times s^1 $ ] and height @xmath11 , one can construct a hole by identifying two of the strip s time - like edges and subsequently cutting open the geometry along this edge ( fig .",
    "[ figure02 ] ) . by applying this procedure repeatedly ( obeying certain causality constraints @xcite ) ,",
    "more and more wormholes can be created .",
    "once the regularized path integral has been performed , including a sum over geometries with wormholes , one takes a continuum limit by letting @xmath17 and renormalizing the coupling constants appropriately , as will be described in the following sections .",
    "note that our wormholes are minimally causality- and locality - violating in that they are located within a single proper - time step ( the smallest time unit available in the discretized theory ) and the associated baby universes which are born at time @xmath15 are reglued at time @xmath18  without twist \" @xcite . in a macroscopic interpretation",
    "one could describe them as wormholes which are instantaneous in the proper - time frame of an ensemble of freely falling observers .",
    "note that this is invariantly defined ( on minkowski space , say ) once an initial surface has been chosen .",
    "such a restriction is necessary if one wants to arrive at a well - defined unitary evolution via a transfer matrix formalism , as we are doing . to include wormholes",
    "whose ends lie on different proper - time slices , one would have to invoke a third - quantized formulation , which would very likely result in _ macroscopic _ violations of causality , locality and therefore unitarity , something we are trying to avoid in the present model .",
    "one could wonder whether the effect in the continuum theory of our choice of wormholes is to single out a preferred frame or coordinate system .",
    "our final result will show that this is not the case , at least not over and above that of the pure gravitational model without topology changes .",
    "the effect of the inclusion of wormholes turns out to be a rather mild  dressing \" of the original theory without holes .",
    "we believe that the essence of our model lies not so much in how the wormholes are connected , because they do not themselves acquire a nontrivial dynamics in the continuum limit .",
    "rather , it is important that their number is sufficiently large to have an effect on the underlying geometry , but on the other hand sufficiently controlled so as to render the model computable .",
    "a similar type of wormhole has played a prominent role in past attempts to devise a mechanism to explain the smallness of the cosmological constant in the euclidean path integral formulation of _",
    "four_-dimensional quantum gravity in the continuum @xcite .",
    "the wormholes considered there resemble those of our toy model in that both are non - local identifications of the spacetime geometry of infinitesimal size .",
    "the counting of our wormholes is of course different since we are working in a genuinely lorentzian setup where certain causality conditions have to be fulfilled .",
    "this enables us to do the sum over topologies completely explicitly .",
    "whether a similar construction is possible also in higher dimensions is an interesting , but at this stage open question .",
    "for the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional lorentzian gravity model including a sum over topologies , the partition function of a single spacetime strip of infinitesimal duration with summed - over boundaries was evaluated in @xcite and @xcite . in the present paper , we will extend this treatment by calculating the full one - step propagator , or , equivalently , the generating function for the partition function of a single strip with given , fixed boundary lengths .",
    "this opens the way for investigating the full dynamics of the model .",
    "the discrete set - up described above leads to the wick - rotated one - step propagator @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the bare inverse newton s constant and @xmath21 the bare ( dimensionless ) cosmological constant , and we have omitted an overall constant coming from the gauss - bonnet integration .",
    "the sum in ( [ transferlaplacedef ] ) is to be taken over all triangulations with @xmath12 space - like links in the initial and @xmath13 space - like links in the final boundary .",
    "note that the number of holes does not appear as one of the arguments of the one - step propagator since we only consider holes that exist within one strip .",
    "consequently , the number of holes does not appear explicitly as label for the quantum states , and the hilbert space coincides with that of the pure cdt model .",
    "nevertheless , the integrated effect of the topologically non - trivial configurations changes the dynamics and the quantum hamiltonian , as we shall see .",
    "the one - step propagator ( [ transferlaplacedef ] ) defines a transfer matrix @xmath22 by @xmath23 from which we obtain the propagator for @xmath15 time steps as usual by iteration , @xmath24 for simplicity we perform the sum in ( [ transferlaplacedef ] ) over triangulated strips with periodically identified boundaries in the spatial direction and one marked time - like edge . by virtue of the latter , @xmath25 satisfies the desired composition property of a propagator , @xmath26 where the sums on the right - hand sides are performed over an intermediate constant - time slice of arbitrary discrete length @xmath27 .    performing the fixed - genus part of the sum over triangulations in ( [ transferlaplacedef ] ) yields @xmath28 } \\binom{n}{{l_{in}}}\\binom{n}{2{{\\mathfrak g}}}\\frac{(2{{\\mathfrak g}})!}{{{\\mathfrak g } } !

    "we will use the generating function formalism with @xmath30 where we have defined @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",

    "<S> we show that the presence of infinitesimal wormholes leads to a decrease in the effective cosmological constant , reminiscent of the suppression mechanism considered by coleman and others in the four - dimensional euclidean path integral . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , in the continuum limit we obtain a finite spacetime density of microscopic wormholes without assuming fundamental discreteness . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that one can in principle make sense of a gravitational path integral which includes a sum over topologies , provided suitable causality restrictions are imposed on the path integral histories . </S>"
