    "quantum phase transitions between two fermi liquids , one of which spontaneously breaks translational symmetry and so reconstructs its fermi surface , have been of longstanding theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "important new examples of experimental realizations have emerged in the past few years,@xcite and so a full theoretical understanding is of some urgency .",
    "next to immediate relevance for a class of strongly correlated electron materials , the spin - fermion model has evolved into a minimal model for itinerant lattice electrons with strong , commensurate magnetic fluctuations that are believed to destroy the fermi liquid behavior when tuned to the critical point .",
    "how the compressible electron liquid , without lorentz symmetry and without particle - hole symmetry , behaves when its correlations become singular , could provide some direction in the search for new universality classes beyond , for example , the better - known gross - neveu model of dirac fermions which enjoys more symmetries .",
    "however , despite several decades of theoretical work , key questions remain open especially in the important case of two spatial dimensions .",
    "early theories @xcite for such quantum phase transitions focused on effective models for the quantum fluctuations of the order parameter , while treating the fermi surface reconstruction as an ancillary phenomenon .",
    "however , it has since become clear @xcite that such an approach is inadequate , and the fermi surface excitations are primary actors in the critical theory .",
    "reference postulated a critical theory for fermi surface reconstruction , in which the fermi surface excitations and the bosonic order parameter were equally important and both acquired anomalous dimensions .",
    "these excitations were strongly coupled to each other by a `` yukawa '' coupling of universal strength , and their correlators scaled with a common dynamic critical exponent , @xmath0 .",
    "explicit computations were performed in the context of a @xmath1 expansion , where the physical number of fermion flavors is generalized to @xmath2 .",
    "taking @xmath2 large , one can formally reorganize wick s theorem in powers of @xmath1 and then extrapolate results to the physical number of fermion flavors .",
    "for the hot - spot field theory at the onset of spin - density wave order , no such critical theory appeared at the two - loop level .",
    "indeed , it was pointed out that at higher loops @xcite there is a breakdown of the @xmath1 expansion , and so it remained unclear whether the postulated fixed point existed .    here",
    "we address the problem of fermi surface reconstruction at the onset of spin - density wave order by an analysis based on a formally exact functional renormalization group ( frg ) approach.@xcite this rg approach allows a computation of correlation function as a function of a continuous cutoff scale @xmath3 ; from the `` uv '' at energies of the order of the bandwidth down to `` infrared '' excitations at and in the vicinity of the fermi surface .",
    "nonuniversal quantities and crossover scales can be extracted from the same solution which also yields the critical exponents in the limit @xmath4 . combined with the potential to resolve the momentum ( and frequency ) dependence or correlators along the fermi surface ,",
    "the frg offers much more than the field theoretic rg or conventional @xmath5 expansion which is typically used to extract the leading singularities only .    in this paper",
    ", we solve a set of coupled flow equations which treats the electrons on equal footing to the collective , order - parameter fluctuations .",
    "we truncate the flow equations to a set of discrete points on the fermi surface .",
    "when projecting our correlators onto the hot spot as a function of momenta , we establish the existence of a fixed point with the scaling structure postulated in ref .  , describing the quantum phase transition between two fermi liquids : from the metal with preserved @xmath6 spin symmetry to the metallic antiferromagnet which spontaneously breaks spin symmetry .",
    "a significant feature of our truncation is that it ties the parameters controlling the order parameter fluctuations to those associated with the fermion excitations , and this is important for a proper description of the scaling structure .",
    "we present numerical estimates for the critical exponents of the boson and fermion spectral functions , and for the variation in the fermionic quasiparticle residue around the fermi surface . during our computations",
    ", we keep the shape of the fermi surface fixed . in principle",
    ", one would have to allow for a flowing fermi surface and consequently a flowing hot spot .",
