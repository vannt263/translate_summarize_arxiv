    "one of the severe consequences of the plasma disruptions in tokamaks is the generations of the runaway electron ( re ) beams ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "the prevention of such re beams is of a paramount importance in future tokamaks , especially in the iter operation , since it may severely damage a device wall @xcite .    at present",
    "there are several proposals to mitigate res generated during plasma disruptions .",
    "the mitigation of res by the gas injections has been discussed ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "suppression of res by the resonant magnetic perturbations ( rmps ) has been also intensively discussed since late 1990s ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "however , up to now there is no a regular strategy to solve this problem .",
    "one of the reasons is that the physical mechanisms of the formation of res during plasma disruptions is still not well  known .",

    "there were numerous dedicated experiments to study the problem of runaway current generation during plasma disruptions triggered by massive gas injections ( mgi ) in the textor tokamak ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , in kstar tokamak @xcite , the jet tokamak @xcite , in diii - d @xcite , alcator c - mod @xcite , and others . in these works",
    "the dependencies of re generation on the toroidal magnetic field , on the magnetic field fluctuations , on the species of injection gases have been investigated .",
    "particularly , in kstar tokamak @xcite it has been found that there is no the toroidal magnetic field threshold @xmath8 t as was indicated by previous experiments in other tokamaks . in ref .",
    "@xcite mhd simulations have been performed to study the confinement res generated during rapid disruptions by mgi in diii - d , alcator c - mod , and iter .",
    "such simulations with two different mhd codes have been carried out by @xcite to analyze shot  to  shot variability of re currents in diii - d tokamak discharges .",
    "these numerous experiments show the complex nature of plasma disruption processes especially the formation of re beams , and its evolution .",
    "one of the important features of this event is its irregularity and variability of re beam parameters from one discharge to another one .",
    "this indicates the sensitivity of disruption processes and re beam formations on initial conditions which is the characteristic feature of nonlinear processes , particularly , the deterministic chaotic system",
    ". therefore , _ ab initio _ numerical simulations of these processes may be not always successful to understand their mechanisms because of the complexity of computer simulations of nonlinear processes @xcite .",
    "the problems of numerical simulations of plasma disruptions is comprehensively discussed by @xcite .    in this work",
    "we intend to approach to this problem from the point of view of hamiltonian chaotic systems , mainly the magnetic stochasticity in a magnetically confined plasmas @xcite . based on the ideas of these systems and analyses of numerous experimental results , mainly obtained in the textor tokamak we propose possible mechanisms of formation and evolution of re beams created during plasma disruptions . since a self  consistent theoretical treatment of all these processes is very complicated we developed theoretical models for each stages of a plasma disruption .",
    "these models are used to estimate the characteristic times of the thermal and current quenches , the spatial size of runaway plasma beam and their decay times , the speed of re radial drifts , the effect of magnetic perturbations .",
    "it is believed that the plasma disruption starts due to a large  scale magnetic stochasticity caused by excited of mhd modes with low poloidal @xmath9 and toroidal @xmath10 numbers , ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the heat and particle transports in the strongly chaotic magnetic field causes the fast temperature drop and ceases the plasma current .",
    "however , at the certain spectrum of magnetic perturbations , for example , at the sufficiently small amplitude of the @xmath5 mode the chaotic field lines may not extend to the central plasma region due to the creation of an intact magnetic surface . in the case of plasmas with the safety factor @xmath0 at magnetic axis",
    "@xmath13 the intact magnetic surface can be located between magnetic surface @xmath1 and the nearest low  order rational surface @xmath3 [ or @xmath4 ,  ] .",
    "this intact magnetic surface confines particles in the central plasma region and serves as a transport barrier to particles during the current quench .",
    "electrons in the confined region are accelerated due to large toroidal electric field and forms the relatively stable of re beams .",
    "this occurs , for instance , when the plasma disruption initiated by the heavy ar gas injection which does not penetrate deep into the plasma , therefore it does not excite the @xmath14 mode with the sufficiently large amplitude . in contrary",
    ", the injection of the lighter noble gases neon and helium does not generate runaways .",
    "the reason is that light gases penetrate deeper into the plasma and excite the large ",
    "amplitude ( @xmath5 ) mode .",
    "the existence of an intact magnetic surface and its location depends on the radial profile of the safety factor and the spectrum of magnetic perturbations .",
    "the latter sensitively depend on the plasma disruption conditions and vary unpredictably from one discharge to another during plasma disruptions .",
    "this makes re formation process unpredictable and may explain a shot  to  shot variability of the parameters of re beams .",
    "the role of the safety factor profile in the formation of re beams can be pronounced during disruptions of plasmas with the reversed magnetic shear . in the plasmas with the non - monotonic radial profiles of the safety factor it has been observed an improved confinement of energy and particles due to the internal transport barrier located near the minimal value of the safety factor , i.e. , near the shearless magnetic surface @xcite . during disruptions",
    "this magnetic surface acts as a robust magnetic barrier that separates a chaotic magnetic field formed in outer region from the penetration into the central plasma region .",
    "electrons confined by the shearless magnetic surface can form a stable re beam with a relatively large transversal size .",
    "recently published results of the disruption experiments in the tftr tokamak with the reversed magnetic shear indeed show the formation of a large re beam with long confinement times @xcite .",
    "based on this mechanism we study the main three stages of the post  disruption plasma evolution : the fast thermal quench ( tq ) , the current quench ( cq ) , and the re beam evolution .",
    "the physical processes during each of these stages will be studied by theoretical models .",
    "these processes are the formation of stochastic magnetic field , heat and particle transport in a stochastic magnetic field , the acceleration of electrons by inductive electric field , the lost mechanisms of res , and the effect of internal and external magnetic perturbations .",

    "this agrees with the observation that the runaways are only seen in the inner half of the torus while they are obviously quickly lost from the outer part .",
    "* one observes a short tiny spike during the energy quench ; we have described this spike previously ; this spike is attributed to the loss of runaways born at the start up of the discharge from the ergodic zone . * in the case of disruptions caused by injection of light he and ne gases the energy quench is due to processes directly related to the penetration of neutral impurity into the plasma ; if heavier argon is injected fast electron transport in stochastic magnetic field is of more importance .",
    "stochastic motion of plasma particles is also responsible for the current decay ; however due to the ambipolarity of particle losses the ion motion essentially affects the duration of the cq stage .",
    "the estimations of the energy quench and the current decay times based on the models presented agree well with observations . * the slow decay of the re current in the plateau phase is explained by the loss of runaways due to two effects : ( @xmath6 ) an outward shift of the runaways due to their continuous acceleration and the subsequent loss at the wall ; ( @xmath7 ) by the formation of a stochastic layer of high  energy res at the beam edge in the presence of the @xmath5 mhd mode . *",
    "the effect of the external resonant magnetic perturbations on low - energy electrons ( up to 5 - 10 mev ) is weak and does not cause their loss .",
