    "contemporary x - ray space observatories , like chandra , xmm - newton and their predecessors , have collected a considerable amount of observational data of the thermal emission coming from surface layers of neutron stars which are characterized by enormous magnetic fields @xmath7 g ( see @xcite,@xcite ) . in particular , the observation of absorption features in the x - ray spectrum of some isolated neutron stars ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) has suggested possible models of atmospheres which allow the presence of coulomb systems  @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen atom is the simplest and most studied coulombic system in weak and strong magnetic fields ( see for example the early review  @xcite and references therein , and for more recent studies ) .    in the present",
    "study our goal is to apply a physics recipe ( described in full generality in  @xcite ) for choosing variational trial functions to the study the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field and its electromagnetic transitions between the lowest bound states @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the study is intended as a test of the methodology developed in  @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic transitions in the hydrogen atom in the absence of a magnetic field is a widely described subject ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . in a strong magnetic field",
    "such electromagnetic transitions have been studied by a number of authors , specially focusing on the effects of the transverse motion across the magnetic field direction ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "our consideration is non - relativistic , based on a variational solution of the schroedinger equation .",
    "thus , the magnetic field strength is restricted by the schwinger limit @xmath11 g .",
    "our study is also based on the born - oppenheimer approximation of zero order : the proton is assumed to be infinitely massive .",
    "thus we neglect the effects of the cm motion _",
    "i.e. _ the effects of the transverse motion of the atom with respect to the magnetic field orientation .",
    "the study is realized in two steps : ( i ) a variational calculation of the states @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is done with suitable trial functions ( selected according to the physics recipe ) , and ( ii ) with the variationally obtained approximate wavefunctions we calculate the allowed radiative transitions among these states in the electric dipole approximation ( see below ) .",
    "atomic units are used throughout ( @xmath12=@xmath13=@xmath14=1 ) , albeit energies are expressed in rydberg ( ry ) .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath15 is given in a.u . with @xmath16 g , although frequently we will also use magnetic fields strengths given in gauss for convenience .",
    "the hamiltonian which describes the coulomb system formed by an infinitely massive proton and one electron @xmath17 placed in a homogeneous constant magnetic field directed along the @xmath18-axis , @xmath19 is given by@xmath20 where @xmath21 is the electron momentum , @xmath22 is the distance between the electron and the proton fixed at the origin , and @xmath23 is a vector potential corresponding to the magnetic field @xmath24 .",
    "a contribution to the energy coming from the coupling between the electron intrinsic magnetic moment and the magnetic field @xmath25 , being constant , has been dropped from ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "now , if we choose the vector potential in the symmetric gauge @xmath26 the hamiltonian acquires the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the laplacian operator , and @xmath29 is the conserved @xmath18-component of the electron angular momentum .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham - h ] ) is also invariant with respect to the @xmath18-parity @xmath30 ( _ i.e. _ reflections @xmath31 ) .",
    "thus the eigenstates can be classified by @xmath32 : the magnetic quantum number @xmath33 , corresponding to the conservation of @xmath29 , and the @xmath18-parity quantum number @xmath34 .",
    "the procedure which we use to explore the problem , is the variational method with a well defined recipe for choosing trial functions .",
    "this recipe is based on physical arguments , described in full generality in @xcite .",
    "the basic ingredients are ( i ) for a given trial function @xmath35 , the potential @xmath36 , for which such function is an exact eigenfunction , should reproduce as many as possible the basic properties of the original potential , _",
    "e.g. _ in the present case it should reproduce the coulomb singularities and the harmonic oscillator behavior at small and large @xmath22 distances respectively , and ( ii ) the trial function @xmath35 should include the symmetries of the problem .",
    "for example , if the ground state is studied , the trial function @xmath35 has to be a nodeless function . adhering to this recipe , in  @xcite it was proposed the following function for the hydrogen ground state @xmath37 @xmath38   & &   e^{-\\sqrt { \\gamma_{1 } r^{2 } + ( \\gamma_{2}r^{3 } + \\gamma_{3}\\rho^{2}r+ \\gamma_{4}\\rho^{3}+\\gamma_{5}\\rho r^{2})b^2   + \\frac{\\gamma_{6}b^{2}\\rho^{4}}{16 } + \\frac{\\gamma_{7}b^{2}\\rho^{2}r^{2}}{16 } } } \\nonumber\\ , ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 are variational parameters .",
    "the potential associated with the function ( [ trialgs ] ) reproduces the coulomb singularity at @xmath40 as well as the harmonic oscillator for @xmath41 of the original hamiltonian ( [ ham - h ] ) .",
    "the function ( [ trialgs ] ) has no nodes . in the following",
    "we will use the function ( [ trialgs ] ) for the variational study of the ground state @xmath8 .    for the lowest excited states @xmath9 ,",
    "@xmath10 the presence of the magnetic field does not modify the nodal structure of the field - free exact eigenfunctions . ] .",
    "a hint for this can be obtained in first order degenerate perturbation theory in @xmath42 , where one can see that the states @xmath9 , @xmath10 are not mixed .",
    "thus the following variational functions for the @xmath9 , @xmath10 states are proposed    @xmath43    where the functions @xmath44 have the same functional form as ( [ trialgs ] ) but with their own @xmath45-parameters .",
    "thus , in the functions ( [ trial2pm1 ] ) , ( [ trial2p0 ] ) we keep the same polynomial prefactor as in the corresponding field - free wavefunctions and multiply them by a nodeless function .",
    "it is easy to check that the functions ( [ trialgs ] ) , ( [ trial2pm1 ] ) and ( [ trial2p0 ] ) are orthogonal .",
    "these functions describe the lowest energy states , @xmath46 , among the states with quantum numbers @xmath47 respectively , in all the range of magnetic fields studied .",
    "in a magnetic field the @xmath33-degeneracy of the hydrogen energy levels is fully removed and electromagnetic transitions depend explicitly on the magnetic quantum numbers of the initial and final states in the transition .",
    "a consideration of electromagnetic transitions in the electric dipole approximation is valid even in the case of high magnetic fields as long as transitions occur among states with the same landau quantum number ( in this case the characteristic wave lengths are always much larger than the ( longitudinal or transverse ) _ size _ of the system ( see @xcite ) ) .",
    "all the states considered in the present study belong to the same ground landau - level and thus the electric dipole approximation is justified .",
    "relevant formulas for the electromagnetic transitions in the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field were given in @xcite .",
    "in the electric dipole approximation we are interested in the square of the matrix element ( called dipole strength ) @xmath48 where @xmath49 label the final and initial states in the transition , and @xmath50 are the spherical components ( @xmath51 ) of the electric dipole operator .",
    "the oscillator strength of the transition is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the ( binding ) energy difference of the initial and final states .",
    "the transition probability is calculated according to the relation @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "we have two selection rules implicit in the matrix element @xmath56 ( eq .  ( [ dtautau ] ) ) _ viz .",
    "_ , parity change and @xmath57 which implies @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the transitions with @xmath59 are characterized by a linearly polarized radiation along the magnetic field direction with @xmath60 , while the transitions with @xmath61 are characterized by circularly polarized radiation with @xmath62 ( for right polarization ) , or @xmath63 ( for left polarization ) .",
    "the results of the variational calculations of the total @xmath64 and binding and the total energy @xmath65 , _ i.e. _ @xmath66 ( for states in the ground landau - level ) . ] @xmath67 energies for the lowest @xmath37 , @xmath9 and @xmath68 states of the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field ranging @xmath69 g are presented in tables  ( [ tabla:1s0 ] ) , ( [ tabla:2p-1 ] ) and ( [ tabla:2p0 ] ) respectively was analyzed in @xcite with the trial function ( [ trialgs ] ) . however , in order to have precise numerical information of the variational parameters appearing in the trial function , we repeated the calculations done in @xcite for all the magnetic fields quoted there . ] .",
    "results for binding energies of these lowest states are also summarized in fig .",
    "( [ fig:1 ] ) . in this figure",
    "one can immediately see that the binding energy grows steadily as the magnetic field increases for all three states @xmath37 , @xmath9 and @xmath68 .",
    "in particular , the ionization energy reaches @xmath70kev for a magnetic field at the schwinger limit where @xmath71 g . the increasing in binding energy as the magnetic field grows",
    "is _ faster _ ( and comparable ) for the bound states @xmath37 , and @xmath9 ( increasing in @xmath72 times for the domain @xmath73 g ) as compared with the rate of increase of the binding energy for the bound state @xmath68 ( increasing only in @xmath74 times for the domain @xmath73 g ) .",
    "in fact the binding energy of the state @xmath68 approaches asymptotically to the value @xmath75ry as @xmath76 ( see  @xcite and table  ( [ tabla:2p0 ] ) )",
    ".    for all states studied the results of the binding energies given by the simple trial functions ( [ trialgs ] ) , ( [ trial2pm1 ] ) , ( [ trial2p0 ] ) are , in general , in very good agreement with the approaches of ruder _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and kravchenko _ et al .",
    "_  . for small to moderately high magnetic fields ( @xmath77a.u . )",
    "the relative differences between our binding energies and those of are found to be @xmath78 .",
    "it is worth to emphasize the remarkable coincidence in 9 digits for the ground state binding energy given by ( [ trialgs ] ) and the today s most accurate results of in the domain of magnetic fields @xmath79a.u .",
    "the agreement of the binding energies with the corresponding perturbative results @xmath80 , obtained with a logarithmic perturbation theory ( see @xcite and references therein ) , is also very good .",
    "however , the results for the binding energies of the three states studied obtained with the variational functions ( [ trialgs ] ) , ( [ trial2pm1 ] ) and ( [ trial2p0 ] ) show that the accuracy gradually decreases as the magnetic field increases and the relative differences for such binding energies ( when compared with the corresponding results of references @xcite and ) reach values @xmath81 for @xmath82a.u .",
    "( see tables  ( [ tabla:1s0 ] ) , ( [ tabla:2p-1 ] ) , ( [ tabla:2p0 ] ) ) .",
    "it indicates that the adiabatic separation of the transverse and longitudinal degrees of freedom is slightly delayed in the functions ( [ trialgs ] ) , ( [ trial2pm1 ] ) and ( [ trial2p0 ] ) .",
    "a comparison of the binding energies of the two lowest states @xmath37 ( @xmath83 ) and @xmath9 ( @xmath84 ) with the asymptotic ( adiabatic ) formulas @xmath85 ( see _ e.g. _  ) shows that , in both cases , the results given by this asymptotic formula are still far from the more accurate variational calculations , being different in about 3 times for the highest magnetic fields studied .",
    "for instance , at the magnetic field @xmath86a.u .",
    "the adiabatic formula gives @xmath87ry and @xmath88ry , while the present numerical results are @xmath89ry and @xmath90ry , respectively ( see tables  ( [ tabla:1s0]),([tabla:2p-1 ] ) ) .",
    "even the asymptotic binding energy difference @xmath91ry is about 1.5 times larger than the variational one @xmath92ry for such a magnetic field .    in practice , a full variational calculation",
    "is easily done in a standard desktop computer , it takes few minutes of cpu time .    .      with the approximate wavefunctions ( [ trialgs ] ) , ( [ trial2pm1 ] ) and ( [ trial2p0 ] ) found in the variational procedure described above",
    ", we carried out a study of the electromagnetic transitions between the states @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the ground state @xmath8 , _ i.e. _ @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "the transition @xmath2 occurs by absorption ( emission ) of circular - right - polarized radiation ( @xmath62 ) , while the transition @xmath3 occurs by absorption ( emission ) of linearly - polarized ( along the magnetic field direction ) radiation ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "neither @xmath9 , nor @xmath10 have a excitation ( de - excitation ) mode to the ground state via left - polarized radiation .",
    "the first remarkable observation concerning the electromagnetic transitions is the fact that , if for small magnetic fields the transition probabilities for both transitions are comparable in magnitude , for strong magnetic fields the ( circularly polarized ) transition @xmath2 is strongly suppressed in comparison to the corresponding transition probability for the ( linearly polarized ) transition @xmath95 ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig : w ] ) ) .",
    "this phenomenon is a consequence of the strong deformation of the electronic distribution due to the enourmous lorentz force acting on it , being elongated in the direction of the magnetic field , thus , enhancing the longitudinal polarization transition mode @xmath60 with respect to the transverse transition modes @xmath96 .    in the other extreme of small magnetic fields ,",
    "perturbative results for the dipole and oscillator strengths and transition probabilities are given by @xcite : @xmath97 for the @xmath98 transition , and @xmath99 for the @xmath100 transition , where the magnetic field strength @xmath15 is in a.u .",
    "these results show different behaviors for both transitions . while for the @xmath101 transition all quantities @xmath102 and @xmath103 are growing functions of @xmath42 , in the case of the @xmath98 transition the oscillator strength @xmath104 and the transition probability @xmath105 slightly decrease for small increasing magnetic fields reaching a minimum for @xmath106a.u . , and @xmath107a.u . respectively . for larger magnetic fields @xmath108a.u .",
    "all quantities @xmath109 and @xmath110 are growing functions of @xmath42 . as we go to higher ( non - perturbative ) magnetic fields the results obtained with the variational functions ( [ trialgs ] ) , ( [ trial2pm1 ] ) and ( [ trial2p0 ] ) show that the dipole strengths and the oscillator strengths of both transitions eventually reach a maximum as the magnetic field grows after which they start to decrease monotonously in the region of high magnetic fields @xmath111a.u . for the @xmath112 transition",

    "it is important to mention that if for the variational binding energies there exists a criterion to decide which results given by different approximate wavefunctions are better ( since variational binding energies approach from below to the true binding energies ) , there exists no similar criterion for other expectation values or matrix elements .",
    "thus , it is not clear so far which results for dipole strengths are better .",
