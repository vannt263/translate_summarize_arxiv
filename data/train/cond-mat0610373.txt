    "quantum well infrared photodetectors ( qwips ) have become widely used quantum heterostructures for thermal imaging application during the last ten years @xcite .",
    "thanks to the very recent introduction of quantum cascade detectors ( qcds ) @xcite , qwips exist now in two modes of electronic transport : photoconductive and photovoltaic . for the first type",
    "( the regular qwip inserted today in focal plane arrays ) , an external bias is necessary to drift the electrons .",
    "they are characterized by a dark current and so they operate at low temperature .",
    "the second type of detectors uses a photovoltaic mode : no external bias is applied .",
    "no dark current exists in these devices and they are promising for applications at higher temperature , larger wavelengths  @xcite and smaller pixel areas . in all these structures , however , the electronic transport is a very complex issue and the performances of the devices are finally governed by fundamental physics problems .",

    "the diffusion of electrons from 3d to 2d states ( and vice versa ) is a particularly difficult theoretical problem@xcite .",
    "that is why most models use adjustable parameters such as the capture time @xcite or the capture probability , affecting the photoconductive gain @xcite . in quantum cascade lasers , on another side , significant electric fields are applied , resulting in charge transfers .",
    "the description of the electronic transport has to involve schrdinger and poisson equations self - consistantly , which is a source of difficulty as well .",
    "with respect to these two devices , the qcd structure is rather simple since it involves only 2d states ( and therefore matrix elements can be calculated without difficulty ) and no bias is applied : there is no need for poisson equation , and the flat band condition is an excellent approximation , also because the doping levels are low .",
    "for all these reasons , the qcd appears as an archetype of complex quantum heterostructures , a model system for the experimental study of the electronic transport in a complex multiple quantum well structure together with its modeling .",
    "this will be shown in this paper , in which the mechanisms of electronic transport in quantum cascade heterostructures are described .",
    "for the first time , electronic transport in such a complex structure is calculated ab initio . by this expression , we mean that the current is calculated without any other adjustable parameters than standard effective masses and band offsets found in the general literature on semiconductors .",
    "the details of the qcd structure and the principle of detection are described in sec.ii . in sec.iii , the model describing the electronic transport",
    "is presented in details , relying on the calculation of all the transition rates between different subbands due to an electron - optical phonon hamiltonian . through an analytical derivation of the sum of the different paths that an electron can follow to cross the structure , the resistance of the complex multiple quantum well structure",
    "is expressed in a very simple form ( sec .",
    "the analogy between this expression and the einstein relation will be underlined .",
    "the qcd considered in this paper is a gaas / algaas heterostructure composed of 40 periods of 7 quantum wells .",
    "the quantum wells are made in gaas .",
    "the first quantum well of each period is n - doped in order to populate its first energy level @xmath0 in the conduction band with electrons ( the nominal doping concentration is about @xmath1 ) .",
    "barriers are made in @xmath2 .",
    "the quantum wells ( respectively the barriers ) have the following widths : 68 , 20 , 23 , 28 , 34 , 39 and 48 @xmath3 ( respectively 56.5 , 39.55 , 31 , 31 , 31 , 31 , 22.6 @xmath3 ) .",
    "these dimensions have been optimized in order to create the quantum cascade of levels shown in figure 1 .",
    "figure 1 ( a ) presents wave functions associated with each energy subband , in one period of the device .",
    "wave functions associated with each energy subband are delocalized through the heterostructure .",
    "absorption of a photon brings electrons from the first energy level to energy @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "the first and the second quantum wells are coupled . in this way , electrons are transferred from level @xmath4 or @xmath5 towards energy level @xmath6 mostly through the longitudinal optical phonon interaction . because of the coupling between the second and the third quantum well , electrons will be relaxed to energy level @xmath7 and so on .",
    "electrons are relaxing from the left to the right of the structure step by step ( see figure 1 ( b ) ) .",
    "finally the net result under illumination is the transfer of electrons from energy level @xmath0 of one period to energy level @xmath0 of the following period . in this way",
    ", the structure acts as a photovoltaic infrared detector .",
    "as usual with this kind of device , the resistance will be presented in terms of @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the resistance of the pixel and @xmath10 the area of the pixel ) .",
    "hypotheses about electronic transitions between the different energy levels have to be made for the determination of the @xmath8 of such a structure .",
    "considering the well and barrier widths , only interactions between electrons and optical phonons ( lo - phonons ) have been taken into account .",
    "the differences between the energy levels are indeed sufficiently high to neglect the influence of the interaction between electrons and acoustical phonons@xcite .",
    "all other possible interactions have been neglected too .",
    "interface roughness has low influence on intersubband scattering , although it was possible to measure its influence at very low temperature  @xcite ( 4 k ) .",
    "electron - electron interaction is efficient for electrons thermalization inside a subband  @xcite , but negligible for intersubband scattering in our cascade scheme with many subband separations greater than @xmath11 mev which corresponds to the energy of the optical phonons  @xcite .",
    "the transition rates due to the interaction between electrons and optical phonons will be evaluated first following ferreira et al .",
    "@xcite . starting from an initial state of wavevector @xmath12 and energy @xmath13 in the subband @xmath14 , the transition rate @xmath15 towards the subband @xmath16 ( in s^-1^ ) is obtained through the integration of a matrix element involving a standard electron - optical - phonon hamiltonian .",

    "this evaluation is made in the parabolic approximation of the energy bands .",
    "transitions rates @xmath21 and @xmath22 are linked by the following equation : @xmath23 finally , the global transition rate @xmath24 between the subband @xmath14 and subband @xmath16 is the sum of the two transition rates for absorption of lo - phonons ( @xmath25 ) , and emission of lo - phonons ( @xmath26 ) . in order to calculate the global transition rates @xmath25 and @xmath26 ,",
    "all the initial states of energy @xmath13 are filled at thermal equilibrium by the fermi - dirac occupation factor @xmath27 .",
    "let us first consider the electronic promotion from a subband @xmath14 to a higher subband @xmath16 ( i.e. @xmath28 ) .",

    "of course , similar expressions can be written in the case of electronic transfers from a subband @xmath14 to a lower subband @xmath16 .",

    "the bias can then be introduced as a perturbation , and therefore we will suppose that the matrix elements and the @xmath35 transitions rates do not depend on the voltage .",
    "indeed , the electronic wavefunctions given by the weakly perturbed potential can be supposed non dependant on the arbitrary small voltage . in the frame of this approximation , the current results only from the variation with the applied bias of the distribution of the population as a function of the energy which affect the @xmath36 through the occupation factors @xmath27 . + as an illustration of the exchanges of electrons between subbands occurring in the structure , figure 3 represents the main transition rates at thermodynamical equilibrium at 80 k. in addition , these transfer rates are indicated in table i. transition times @xmath37 can be deduced from the global transition rate @xmath24 by : + @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the two dimensional carrier density associated with the subband @xmath14 .",
    "two consecutive cascades a and b are represented in figure 3 .",
    "for sake of clarity , transitions between two levels in the same cascade have been represented separately from transitions between two levels in consecutive cascades . on figure 3(a ) , most significant intra - cascade transitions are represented .",
    "the typical value of transitions rates between two neighboring levels are between a few @xmath40 , corresponding to transition times between a few ps and a few tens of ps for a temperature of 80 k. on figure 3(b ) , the inter - cascade transitions are reported .",
    "again , the solid line arrows represent the main transfer rates between one cascade and the following one , but these transitions are now limited to a few @xmath41 at the same temperature ( and a corresponding transition time greater than 1 @xmath42 due also to the low amount of electron promotion to higher subbands for satisfying fermi dirac distribution ) .",

    "the resistance of a qcd is completely determined at 80 k by a few inter - cascade cross transitions , namely @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the optimization of a qcd requires decreasing these transitions rates , thus increasing the resistance and decreasing the noise figure .",
