    "furthermore , the hadon - hadron collision facilities such as lhcb at cern and btev at fermilab as well as the lepton - hadron collision facility such as hera - b at desy emerge as the powerful tools to investigate a lot of detailed b - decays  @xcite .",
    "certainly , an important motivation to study b - physics is to make a precision test of standard model especially associated with the unitarity of ckm mixing matrix .",
    "one of the burning questions in physics is whether the complex phase is really the only source of the cp - violation or not . to make such a precision test",
    ", the accurate analyses of exclusive semileptonic b - decays as well as rare b - decays are strongly demanded . as we will discuss in this talk ,",
    "an effective use of light - cone ( lc ) degrees of freedom in those analyses seem crucial to make the calculations more accurate .",
    "this also makes the model - building more scrutinized .",
    "our talk is presented with the following outlines .",
    "the theoretical overview of b - physics is given in the next section , section 2 .",
    "especially , we will discuss the processes determining each ckm - matrix element and the profile of unitary triangle .",
    "we ll also try to make a very brief survey of theoretical development in the last twenty years history of b - physics .",
    "because of enormous works that people have done in b - physics , this survey would be in no way complete but very brief and limited . in any case",
    ", the purpose of section 2 will be to motivate why the exclusive semileptonic b - decays are very important to constrain the ckm mixing matrix . in section 3 ,",
    "then exclusive semileptonic decays are discussed .",
    "some general remarks on the weak form factors will be made and the role of lc degrees of freedom in the exclusive semileptonic decays will be discussed . especially , the difficulties associated with the time - like processes such as the exclusive semileptonic decays in the lc formulation .",
    "we will first identify the embedded states necessary to restore the covariance of the amplitudes and then present a way of handling the embedded states .",
    "some preliminary numerical results are also presented in the exclusive semileptonic decays for @xmath1 with our new way of treating the embedded states .",
    "conclusions follow in section 4 .",
    "in the standard model , the only interaction relevant to the ckm mixing matrix @xmath2 is the weak charged - current interaction given by the lagrangian @xmath3 , where @xmath4 in the standard model , @xmath2 is unitary , i.e. @xmath5 , and all the matrix elements of @xmath2 can be written in terms of three real angles @xmath6 and one real phase - angle @xmath7 as explicitly shown in the particle data group  @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath8 is the usual cabbibo mixing angle .",
    "wolfenstein  @xcite realized the pattern of order of magnitude in each element and parametrized @xmath2 in the orders of @xmath9 .",
    "up to the order of @xmath10 , @xmath2 is given by @xmath11 where four real wolfenstein s parameters are given by ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the unitarity condition leads to the definition of various unitarity triangles : @xmath13 where each off - diagonal element @xmath14 with the unequal quark - flavors @xmath15 and @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath17 , is given by the addition of three complex numbers due to the multiplication of two 3@xmath183 complex matrices , e.g. @xmath19 , while the diagonal elements are given by the sum of three real numbers .",
    "since the off - diagonal element @xmath14 ( @xmath20 ) is zero ( i.e. the sum of three complex numbers is zero ) , it can be given as a triangle in the complex plane .",
    "thus , each off - diagonal element @xmath14 corresponds to a unitarity triangle and there are six independent ones .",
    "only four out of eighteen angles in the six triangles are independent and the area of all triangles is identical measure of cp - violation , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "also , the magnitude of each mixing matrix element @xmath22 is independent of parametrization .    now , let s focus on the current magnitude  @xcite of each mixing matrix element and the corresponding experimental processes used for the determination .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath23 has been determined by the superallowed @xmath24 nuclear @xmath25-decay , the nucleon @xmath25-decay ( @xmath26 ) and the pion @xmath25-decay ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the current average value is given by @xmath28 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath29 and @xmath30 is almost equal to the sine of the cabbibo angle , i.e. @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "@xmath33 is determined by the semileptonic kaon decay @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) and the hyperon semileptonic decays such as @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , while @xmath38 is determined by the semileptonic @xmath39-meson decays of @xmath40 , @xmath41 as well as the leptonic decays @xmath42 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath43 is also determined by the @xmath39-meson semileptonic decays @xmath44 .",
    "the analysis of heavy - to - heavy semileptonic @xmath45-decays such as @xmath46 and @xmath47 has been constrained by the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet )  @xcite and the small value of @xmath48 was determined as @xmath49 .",
    "the hqet has also played the role of constraining the model building .",
    "even smaller value of @xmath50 was determined by the heavy - to - light semileptonic @xmath45-decays of @xmath51 as well as the leptonic decays of @xmath52 . in this way",
    ", the top two rows of @xmath2 matrix were determined mostly by the direct measurements of experimental processes",
    ".    however , the direct measurements are not feasible for the bottom row elements of @xmath2 matrix involving @xmath53-quark .",
    "since the @xmath53-quark mass is so heavy ( @xmath54 gev ) and the lifetime of @xmath53-quark is much shorter than the strong interaction time scale , the @xmath53-quark does nt have any time to form a bound - state meson but quickly decays into @xmath55-quark and @xmath56 .",
    "nevertheless , the rough magnitudes of @xmath57 are consistent with the semileptonic decays of @xmath53-quark @xmath58 measured at cdf and d@xmath59 in the fermilab where the @xmath53-quark evidence was confirmed . especially , the constraint given by @xmath60 is well satisfied by these magnitudes . while the direct measurements are not feasible for @xmath61 , the virtual transition through  penguin \" process will give more informations .",
    "the first evidence of  penguin \" process was seen at cleo ii  @xcite , where the branching ratio of radiative @xmath45-decay was determined as br(@xmath62 ) = ( @xmath63 .",
    "the most interesting and promising unitarity triangle to be measured is ( db ) ; @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "dividing the l.h.s .",
    "( [ eq : triangle ] ) , one gets @xmath66 where each term can be written in terms of wolfenstein s parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 in the complex plane of ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the first term in eq.([eq : triangle - prime ] ) corresponds to the vector from ( 0,0 ) to ( @xmath70 ) and the last term does the vector from ( @xmath70 ) to ( 0,1 ) .",
    "the second term @xmath71 corresponds to the vector from ( 0,1 ) to ( 0,0 ) .",
    "the main interest in determining the profile of the unitarity triangle is then to find the exact location of the apex ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the allowed region of the apex is given by the overlapping region in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) .",
    "the length between the two apices ( 0,0 ) and ( @xmath70 ) is mainly determined by the measurement of ratio @xmath72 .",
    "the allowed region for this length is given by the rainbow around ( 0,0 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) .    also , the length of the adjacent side connecting ( @xmath70 ) to ( 1,0 ) is essentially determined by the measurement of @xmath73 mixing that can provide the value of @xmath74 .",
    "since the value of @xmath75 is very close to that of @xmath76 , one can further constrain this length between ( @xmath70 ) to ( 1,0 ) by measuring the @xmath77 mixing . the rainbow around ( 1,0 )",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) corresponds to the allowed region for this length .",
    "the overlap of the two rainbows is further constrained by the measurement of cp - violation parameter @xmath78 in @xmath79-@xmath80 mixing .",
    "since @xmath78 is a direct measure of the complex phase in @xmath2 , the constraint from @xmath79-@xmath80 mixing is drawn as a horizontal band in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) depending mostly on the value of @xmath68 . the final overlap yields then the allowed region for the apex ( @xmath70 ) of the triangle as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) .",
    "the three angles of the triangle denoted by @xmath81 are given by @xmath82 it is very interesting to note that these angles can also be determined from the cp - asymmetry measurement  @xcite .",
    "the cp - asymmetry is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 . from the experimental measurements of @xmath88 ,",
    "it may be possible to determine the values of angles @xmath89 .",
    "for example , the value of @xmath25 may be determined by the measurement of @xmath90 .",
    "more examples of process to determine each angle are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:1](b ) also shows other processes to fix the profile of the unitary triangle .",
    "the theoretical efforts in the @xmath45 physics have also been very extensive in the last twenty years and we can not summarize all the developments in this talk . perhaps , here we are just content with a very brief survey . in early 80 s ,",
    "the value of @xmath75 was investigated significantly with the qcd improved spectator model developed by altarelli et al .",
    "@xcite . in the middle of 80 s , a model wavefunction due to wirbel",
    ", stech and bauer called wsb model  @xcite was introduced for the heavy quark system .",
    "then , in the late 80 s , the heavy quark symmetry was extensively studied by many authors  @xcite .",
    "perhaps , the most quoted work has been done by isgur and wise  @xcite introducing the isgur - wise function now frequently referred in the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) .",
    "the basic idea of heavy quark symmetry is to realize the hidden symmetry of qcd that can be revealed only in the limit of infinitely heavy quark masses .",
    "the analogous observation in the opposite extreme of zero quark mass limit is the chiral symmetry .",
    "whether the quark masses are heavy or light may be categorized by the qcd scale @xmath91 .",
    "the current quark masses of @xmath92 are much smaller than @xmath91 , while the masses of @xmath93 quarks are much larger than @xmath91 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath94 .",
    "thus , in the limit that @xmath95 and @xmath96 go to zero , the qcd reveals the chiral symmetry @xmath97 and the symmetry is spontaneously broken to @xmath98 due to the non - trivial qcd vacuum .",
    "similarly , in the limit that @xmath99 and @xmath100 go to infinity , the heavy quark symmetry @xmath101(or @xmath102 ) is revealed in qcd .    in the early 90 s",
    ", the hqet was applied extensively in the heavy quark systems . at the same time , the constituent quark model(cqm ) was built by isgur , scora , grinstein and wise and named as isgw model  @xcite .",
    "this model emphasizes the importance of resonance contribution near the small invariant mass of final states in the inclusive semileptonic decays .",
    "in the case of semileptonic @xmath45 decay such as @xmath103 , the invariant mass square @xmath104 of the final state , continuum @xmath105 and @xmath106 quarks , is bound by @xmath107 , where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the four - momenta of electron , neutrino and the @xmath45 meson , respectively .",
    "isgw criticized the early qcd improved spectator model by altarelli _ et .",
    "@xcite because the region of @xmath110 is dominated by the resonances rather than the continuum . in the middle of 90 s , isgw model was extended to a relativistic version and called isgw2 model  @xcite . throughout 90 s ,",
    "the lattice qcd  @xcite was also extensively used to analyze the heavy quark systems . in 90 s , the perturbative qcd(pqcd )  @xcite approach was used mainly to analyze the hadronic decays of heavy mesons .",
    "then , in the later part of 90 s , dispersion relation was used for the analysis of timelike region using the inputs from cqm  @xcite , lattice data  @xcite , hqet and pqcd  @xcite .",
    "the light - cone quark model(lcqm ) was developed around this time .",
    "perhaps , we may categorize the lcqm into four different versions .",
    "first , the isgw2 model was extended to the lc formalism  @xcite .",
    "however , the same input parameters as the isgw2 model were used in this lcqm .",
    "second , the lc version of hqet was developed  @xcite . in this development ,",
    "the wsb model developed in the middle of 80 s was ruled out because the wsb model does nt satisfy the constraint from the heavy quark symmetry .",
    "third , the lc model wavefunction was also introduced  @xcite . however",
    ", modelling the lc wavefunction did nt give any information about the hadron spectra .",
    "finally , we have implemented the variational principle to the qcd motivated effective lc hamiltonian to enable the analysis of meson spectra as well as many wavefunction - related observables such as the form factors , decay constants and electroweak decay rates , etc .",
    "@xcite . in late 90 s ,",
    "also other approaches such as the light - cone qcd sum - rule  @xcite , the dyson - schwinger equation  @xcite and the bethe - salpeter equation  @xcite were used to analyze the heavy quark systems .",
    "more recently , the quark - meson model  @xcite utilizing both hqet and chrial perturbation ( @xmath111 ) theory was used to analyze the heavy - to - light meson decays such as @xmath112 . in the twenty years of @xmath45-physics history , we may note that one of the focal point in most analyses has been the accurate prediction of exclusive semileptonic decays such as @xmath113 and @xmath114 . in the next section",
    ", we now present some more details of exclusive semileptonic decays .",
    "the current matrix element of the semileptonic pseudoscalar to pseudoscalar ( ps@xmath115ps ) meson decays involve the two form factors : @xmath116 + f_0(q^2)\\frac{m_1 ^ 2-m_2 ^ 2}{q^2}q^\\mu\\\\ \\nonumber & = & \\sqrt{m_1 m_2}[h_+(q^2)(v_1+v_2)^\\mu + h_-(q^2)(v_1-v_2)^\\mu],\\\\ \\label{eq : ps to ps}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath117 in the limit of @xmath118 , the only one form factor remains , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath119 and @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is known as the isgur - wise function . also , due to the ademello - gatto theorem  @xcite , @xmath122 .",
    "note here that @xmath123 corresponds to the charge form factor in the @xmath124 limit .",
    "the similar decomposition of the matrix element of the semileptonic pseudoscalar ( ps ) to vector ( v ) meson decays can be made with the four transition form factors .",
    "again in the heavy quark mass limit , only one form factor @xmath125 is needed .",
    "also , the luke theorem  @xcite applies in the zero recoil limit .",
    "however , because of the limited space , we wo nt discuss the details of ps@xmath115v semileptonic decays in this presentation but here focus only on the ps@xmath115ps semleptonic decays .",
    "the analysis of exclusive processes can be made efficiently in the lc formalism with the rational energy - momentum relation . in the lcqm calculations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath126 frame has been used to calculate the weak decays in the timelike region @xmath127 , with @xmath128 and @xmath129 being the initial ( final ) meson mass and the lepton ( @xmath130 ) mass , respectively . however ,",
    "when the @xmath126 frame is used , the inclusion of the nonvalence contributions arising from quark - antiquark pair creation (  z - graph \" ) is inevitable and this inclusion may be very important for the heavy - to - light and light - to - light decays .",
    "nevertheless , the previous analyses  @xcite in the @xmath126 frame considered only valence contributions neglecting the nonvalence contributions .    in this work ,",
    "we treat the nonvalence state using the schwinger - dyson equation to connect the embedded - state shown as the black blob in fig .",
    "[ fig : embed ] to the ordinary lc wave function ( white blob in fig .",
    "[ fig : embed ] ) . to make the program successful , we need some relevant operator connecting one - body to three - body sector shown as the black box in fig .  [",
    "fig : embed ] .",
    "the relevant operator is in general dependent on the involved momenta .",
    "our main observation is that we can remove the four - body energy denomenator @xmath131 using the identity @xmath132 of the energy denominators and obtain the identical amplitude in terms of ordinary lc wave functions of photon and hadron ( white blob ) .",
    "for the small momentum transfer , perhaps the relevant operator may not have too much dependence on the involved momenta and one may approximate it as a constant operator . in contact interaction case , we verified that our prescription of a constant operator in fig .",
    "[ fig : embed](d ) is an exact solution of fig .",
    "[ fig : embed](a ) . in our previous analysis",
    "@xcite for the exclusive ps@xmath115ps semileptonic decays , the form factor @xmath133 obtained from @xmath134 in @xmath135 frame is not only immune to the zero - mode contribution but also in good agreement with the experimental data as well as other theoretical results . in order to obtain the form factor @xmath136 in @xmath137 frame , one has to use another component ( i.e. @xmath138 or @xmath139 ) of the current in addition to the @xmath134 .",
    "however , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , those @xmath138 and @xmath140 are not immune to the zero - mode contributions , which are not easy to be identified in lcqm .",
    "thus , we use @xmath126 frame to determine the constant operator by equating the slope of @xmath141 at @xmath142 in @xmath126 frame to that in @xmath137 frame .",
    "then , we apply the same operator to the calculation of @xmath136 .",
    "we present here some preliminery results for @xmath143 using the approximation of constant operator to illustrate our method .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table  [ kpi ] , we summarize the experimental observables for the @xmath143 decays , where @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "we use our linear potential parameters given by refs .",
    "@xcite in this analysis . as one can see in table  [ kpi ] , our results for the slope @xmath146 of @xmath147 at @xmath142 and @xmath148=@xmath149 are now much improved and comparable with the data .",
    "especially , our result of @xmath146= 0.025 obtained from our effective calculation is in excellent agreement with the data , @xmath150=0.025@xmath1510.006 .",
    "more theoretical details on our effective method as well as heavy - to - heavy and heavy - to - light semileptonic processes will be presented in the future communication .",
    "with the wealth of new or upgraded experimental facilities , precision test of standard model is ever more promising .",
    "we presented a theoretical overview of b - physics and noted that the exclusive semileptonic b - decays and rare b - decays are very important to determine @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath74 , @xmath76 , and @xmath154 stringently .",
    "as we discussed , an effective use of lc degrees of freedom seems crucial to make predictions consistent with many other exclusive processes .",
