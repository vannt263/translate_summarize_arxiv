    "weak  absorbers are also found to have high metallicity ; at least 10% solar , but in some cases even solar or supersolar @xcite .",
    "this is a striking result because , as noted above , luminous galaxies are rarely found within a @xmath17 kpc impact parameter of the quasar .",
    "furthermore , some absorbers have /  ratios that do not allow for @xmath19-enhancement solely from type ii supernovae , suggesting that metals are also produced `` _ _ in situ _ _ '' by type ia supernovae and not ejected by nearby , luminous galaxies .",
    "it is possible that some weak  absorbers arise in areas of intergalactic star formation , or are related to supernovae remnants in dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "their incidence is therefore likely to be related to global star formation rates and supernovae activity in these environments .",
    "@xcite have found that a flattened geometry for weak  absorbers is most consistent with their number statistics and kinematics , and suggest that such structures could be part of the cosmic web .",
    "photoionization modeling suggests that the  absorption arises in a region @xmath20 pcs thick @xcite .",
    "this thin region that produces  absorption is most likely surrounded by a lower density region that produces high ionization  absorption , with both regions centered at the same velocity @xcite .",
    "components offset in velocity by tens of @xmath21  also often exist in  and could represent additional surrounding low density filaments @xcite .",

    "the findings of @xcite for @xmath7 weak  absorbers are consistent with cosmological evolution of the @xmath10 weak  absorber population , based upon @xmath24cdm cosmology @xcite .",
    "however , when the effect of the evolution of the extragalactic background radiation ( ebr ) on the absorber population is taken into account , @xmath25 is expected to be higher at @xmath26 than observed .",
    "this is partly because the less intense ionizing background ( compared to @xmath10 ) leads to an increase in the low - ionization  phase , i.e. absorbers that were below the equivalent width threshold at @xmath10 are detectable at @xmath26 .",
    "also , there is a significant contribution at @xmath26 from  absorption in a lower density phase that gave rise only to higher ionization absorbers at @xmath10 @xcite .",

    "determining the evolution of @xmath25 at higher redshifts is an important step toward identifying the formation processes of weak  absorbers , and thus served as the motivation for this work .    in order to push observational measurements of @xmath25 for weak  absorbers to higher redshifts",

    "sec : conc ] we summarize our findings and end with a discussion .",
    "the 18 uves / vlt qso spectra used for our survey of weak  absorption were obtained from the eso archive .",
    "the spectra typically covered a wavelength range of @xmath27 , though there were usually gaps in coverage from @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( see figure [ fig : redcovplot ] ) .",
    "the resolution was @xmath30 , or @xmath31 .",
    "data reduction procedures are described in @xcite .",
    "continuum fitting followed standard procedures using the irafsfit task .",
    "a cubic spline function was used , typically of order 7 - 9 .    though the spectra were of extremely high quality",
    ", there were some complicating issues .",
    "as already mentioned , there were some small breaks in the coverage in many of the spectra .",
    "the dense  forest made a @xmath32 mg0.1emii  @xmath15  doublet survey impractical for some quasars , but this was not a concern since the @xcite survey also covered this range .",
    "there was also significant contamination from telluric absorption features , making a survey of affected wavelengths impractical , as well .",
    "our general philosophy was to exclude troublesome regions rather than to risk missing  doublets in our survey .      for our survey , we first assumed that every line detected above a @xmath33 significance level was  @xmath34 .",
    "it was then determined if the corresponding  @xmath35 line was present at the expected location with at least a @xmath36 significance level .",
    "if this was the case , the line profiles were checked for similarity in shape by visual inspection , and for consistency with a 2:1 optical depth ratio . in all cases",
    "some supporting lines at the redshift of our  candidate were found ( such as , , , and/or ) .",
    "once the detection of a  absorber was confirmed , we measured the rest frame equivalent width . in order to be accepted as a weak absorber , a rest - frame equivalent width of @xmath5 was required .",
    "we note that our survey could have extended to a much lower equivalent width limit .",
    "the @xmath3 limit was chosen for comparison to previous surveys .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath37 $ ] for a typical doppler parameter of @xmath38 , for an unsaturated line .",
    "fortunately , above this limit interference by telluric absorption did not affect our survey in our selected wavelength regions ( i.e. telluric features were weaker than @xmath3 ) .    for the purpose of the present survey , we focused on absorbers whose redshift fell in the range @xmath1 .",
    "several quasars had coverage at @xmath39 , but the path length was not significant at that @xmath40 .",
    "the large wavelength coverage of these spectra also allowed us to search for weak  absorbers to significantly lower redshifts in most spectra .",
    "therefore , we also considered absorbers with redshifts in the range @xmath9 for comparison with the results of @xcite .",
    "the excellent s / n of these spectra allowed our survey to be nearly 100% complete if we eliminated wavelength ranges with heavy atmospheric absorption .",
    "the telluric features in the eliminated regions acted as `` effective noise '' which made unambiguous detection of a @xmath5  @xmath34 line at a @xmath41 significance level difficult , if not impossible .",
    "figure [ fig : redcovplot ] shows the redshift coverage for the mg0.1emii  @xmath15  doublet in each of our spectra . because we excluded certain redshifts from our search and because not every qso spectrum covered the mg0.1emii  @xmath15  doublet up to @xmath42 , our average redshift does not coincide with the center of our redshift range .",
    "considering these factors , the average redshift is given by @xmath43    in order to verify that we have nearly 100% completeness in the spectral regions that we surveyed , we randomly added two artificial  doublets to each of our spectra , in the redshift range @xmath44 .",
    "simulated lines were not placed in regions of the spectra that were not searched , i.e. the  forest , telluric absorption regions , or coverage gaps .",
    "the artificial lines were all assigned the minimum equivalent width for our survey , @xmath3 .",
    "lines were added , beginning with the observed flux and convolving it with the line spread function for the simulated line .",
    "this allowed us to retain a realistic representation of noise in the region , making artificial lines indistinguishable from real ones .",
    "the spectra were searched for these artificial lines in the same manner that we searched for real lines .",
    "all the artificial lines were found even though they were at the minimum equivalent width for our survey .",
    "therefore , we are confident that we effectively have 100% completeness in the regions we searched .",
    "survey completeness as a function of redshift was calculated according to the formalism given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the total redshift path covered in the 18 qso spectra over the range @xmath1 is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the function that gives the number of lines of sight along which the mg0.1emii  @xmath15  doublet could have been detected at a redshift _ z _ and with a rest frame equivalent width @xmath47 at greater than or equal to a @xmath33 significance level .",
    "_ r _ is the expected ratio of equivalent widths between  @xmath34 and  @xmath35 , which , according to atomic physics , is two for unsaturated lines . as described in ",

    "their  @xmath34 and  @xmath35 profiles are shown in figures [ fig : he2347a]-[fig : he0940 ] .",
    "we find 9 systems over a redshift path of @xmath2 at @xmath51 in the 18 spectra surveyed .",
    "because our survey is 100% complete to @xmath52 , we can simply divide the number of systems by the redshift path to obtain a redshift number density @xmath4 .",
    "figure [ fig : dndzplot ] shows our result , along with the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also show our survey results for the redshift range @xmath9 , separated into the same bins as in @xcite , for which we find agreement to within @xmath53 .",

    "the solid curve shows the no - evolution expectation for @xmath25 in a @xmath24cdm universe ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) normalized to @xmath59 at @xmath60 .",
    "the number density of weak  absorbers changes with redshift for a variety of reasons .",
    "since we expect weak  absorption to arise in small - scale regions , the process of hierarchical structure growth could destroy the absorbers through mergers or collapse . as the metallicity of the universe increases ,",
    "we expect to see an increase in the number of metal - rich systems",
    ". also , the cumulative effects of supernovae , causing superbubbles and superwinds , will redistribute gas in the universe .",
    "the ionization state of weak  absorbers is also expected to change as the ebr evolves .",
    "the ebr is known to change with redshift because of the change in the number density of bright quasars and in the rate of global star formation @xcite .",
    "this changing ebr will have an effect , even on an otherwise static population of absorbers , because of their changing ionization state .",
    "we explore this effect in the following sections .",
    "models by @xcite and @xcite suggest that weak  absorbers consist of a high density region of  and a lower density  phase .",
    "typical densities are on the order of 0.1 @xmath61  for the region that gives rise to the majority of the  absorption and 0.001 @xmath61  for the  region .",
    "we conduct a thought experiment to explore how these absorbers evolve .",
    "let us assume that a given absorber is stable over time , i.e. there is no gravitational collapse , fragmentation , mergers , evaporation , or pressure changes .",
    "in other words , assume that the absorber is subject to no changes except for the evolving ebr .",
    "the total hydrogen column density , @xmath62 , the electron number density , @xmath63 , and the metallicity , @xmath64 , are all constant .",
    "one may ask how the ionization state of the absorber will change as a result of the changing ebr , between @xmath11 and @xmath12 . at @xmath12",
    "the ebr is @xmath65 dex more intense than at @xmath11 , though the shape of the spectrum is similar .",
    "this increase in the photon number density , @xmath66 leads to a change in the ionization parameter , @xmath67 . for a given cloud we can fix @xmath62 and calculate the change in @xmath68 and @xmath69 . at higher redshift",
    ", we find that the increased ebr causes the equivalent width to be larger for the high ionization state  and smaller for the low ionization state , compared to intermediate redshifts .      to illustrate the evolution of weak  absorbers , we simulate the appearance at @xmath12 of three systems modeled by @xcite at @xmath70 subject to the changing ebr and cosmological evolution .",
    "we applied photoionization models using the code cloudy ( version 94.00 ; @xcite ) with an ebr of the form prescribed by @xcite .",
    "we adopted their model including quasars and star forming galaxies , with an escape fraction of 10% and including absorption by the intergalactic medium .",
    "the results are presented in figures [ fig : sim1 ] - [ fig : sim3 ] .",
    "each of the three systems has only a single cloud detected in , but their  absorption profiles differ in strength , kinematic spread , and number of clouds .",
    "the @xmath71 ( figure [ fig : sim2 ] ) and @xmath72 ( figure [ fig : sim3 ] ) systems have offset  components in addition to those centered on the .    each system was evolved to @xmath12 subject to the changing ebr .",
    "once the column density of each component was found , we created a synthetic , noise - free spectrum . for the @xmath72 system",
    ", the  profile evolves below the equivalent width cutoff for our survey ( see figure  [ fig : sim3 ] ) .",
    "the overall trend for all three systems is for weak  absorbers to be less prevalent at @xmath12 than at @xmath73 , while  absorption , which traces the high ionization state , becomes stronger .",
    "we apply a simple physical model to predict @xmath25 at @xmath12 using the results of @xcite as a referemce point .",
    "this model only takes the evolving ebr into account but is useful for exploring which factors affect the evolution of @xmath25 for weak  absorbers .",
    "based on the previous measurement of @xmath25 at @xmath11 by @xcite , we now consider what @xmath25 would be expected at @xmath12 subject to the changing ebr .",
    "we first determine the @xmath47 of a @xmath11 absorber whose ionization state has increased just enough from @xmath11 to @xmath12 that it falls below the detection threshold of our survey .",
    "we compute the column density of  for an absorber with the threshold @xmath3 to be @xmath74 $ ] , assuming a typical doppler parameter , @xmath38 .",
    "models of weak absorbers @xcite have yielded a range of metallicities , @xmath75 , and a range of densities @xmath76  @xmath61 . to illustrate our method we first choose the values that yield the",
    "smallest predicted @xmath25 value at @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and solve for the total column density @xmath80 $ ] subject to the haardt - madau ebr at @xmath12 , again using cloudy .",
    "we then compute the @xmath47 of an absorber with this same total column density subject to the ebr at @xmath11 .",
    "we find @xmath81 .",
    "this is the lowest equivalent width  absorber at @xmath11 that would have been observed as a weak  absorber at @xmath12 .",
    "a similar procedure was followed to find an upper limit on @xmath47 for absorbers that exceed the 0.3  threshold for weak absorption at @xmath11 but were weak at @xmath12 .",
    "such an absorber will have a total column density @xmath82 $ ] , which will produce a @xmath83 absorption at @xmath11 .",
    "once an upper and lower limit on equivalent width at @xmath11 have been obtained , we may integrate over the equivalent width distribution function at this redshift to estimate the number of absorbers per unit redshift that we would expect to observe at @xmath12 .",
    "the equivalent width distribution follows a power law form : @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "the expected ratio of @xmath25 at @xmath12 to @xmath25 at @xmath11 , due only to the changing ebr , is given by @xmath87 cosmological evolution of the absorber population must also be taken into account .",
    "for a model with @xmath58 and @xmath57 , cosmological evolution alone would predict a factor of 1.33 more absorbers at @xmath12 .",
    "thus , when we combine evolution due to the ebr and cosmology , we find a predicted @xmath88 at @xmath12 .",
    "if we vary the input cloud properties , such that @xmath89 and @xmath90 , we find a predicted @xmath91 at @xmath77 . in that case",
    ", the electron density change dominates , and the metallicity change only has a small effect . for this estimate we assumed that typical weak  doublets",
    "are resolved so that @xmath92 is a typical value",
    ". there may be some unresolved saturation in some of the lines in our sample , since the doublet ratios of weak lines are not equal to @xmath93 ( see table [ table : sysprop ] ) .",
    "assuming @xmath94 , we see no significant change in our predicted @xmath25 .",
    "also , @xmath94 implies @xmath95  k , somewhat smaller than the equilibrium temperature cloudy finds for our assumed density and metallicity .",
    "an even smaller @xmath96 , which we consider unlikely , would result in somewhat smaller @xmath25 predictions , but would also require a very cold cloud .",
    "thus we believe that @xmath92 provides a realistic estimate .",
    "the predicted @xmath25 of @xmath97 is significantly higher than the observed value of @xmath98 for weak  absorbers at @xmath99 .",
    "this implies that the population of objects that give rise to weak  absorption are becoming more common at @xmath100 than they were at @xmath77 .",
    "this could occur either through gradual formation of these objects , assuming that they are not destroyed , or through an increase in the importance of processes that generate a non - static population .",
    "we have conducted a survey of 18 qso spectra in the eso archive obtained with the uves on the vlt , searching for weak  absorbers with @xmath5 . in order to test our survey completeness",
    "we randomly added simulated mg0.1emii  @xmath15  transitions to the spectra .",
    "these simulated lines were at the low end of the equivalent width limit . because the spectra have high signal - to - noise , the survey is nearly 100% complete in the regions that we searched , having eliminated regions strongly affected by telluric absorption .",
    "we found 9 systems in a redshift path length of @xmath2 over the range @xmath1 .",
    "this yields a number density per unit redshift of @xmath4 at @xmath99 . for comparison ,",
    "@xcite find @xmath6 at @xmath101 and @xcite find @xmath102 at @xmath70 .",
    "we conclude that the weak  absorber population peaks at @xmath10 , and that the objects that generate this type of absorption are less common both at higher and at lower redshifts .    a decrease in @xmath25 from @xmath77 to @xmath100",
    "would be expected simply on the basis of cosmological evolution .",
    "the strength of  absorption coming from a population of objects is also expected to change subject to the changing ebr . in order to understand the balance of these effects , we calculated the expected @xmath25 at @xmath12 based upon the known population at @xmath11 . for the purpose of this estimate",
    ", we assumed that the absorber population was static or that destruction was balanced by the formation processes between these two epochs , i.e. we only accounted for evolution due to the changing ebr and due to cosmological evolution .",
    "our prediction of @xmath103 is markedly higher than our observed value .",
    "therefore , we conclude that one of two general scenarios must apply . first , the structures that give rise to weak  absorption could be long - lived , and there could be a gradual build - up of these structures over time , such as through hierarchical structure formation .",
    "second , the structures could be transient , such that the rate of their formation process determines @xmath25 .",
    "an obvious example of such a process is star formation .",
    "this second possibility was advocated by @xcite who considered the evolution of @xmath25 from @xmath100 to @xmath104 . in that case , starting with the observed @xmath100 population of weak  absorbers , the evolving ebr along with cosmological evolution would predict a significantly larger population at @xmath104 than is observed .",
    "this issue was complicated by the incidence of a new type of low redshift weak  absorber descended from absorbers from which only  absorption was observed at @xmath100 .",
    "nonetheless , the trend for an overall decrease in the weak  absorber population is consistent with the decrease in the global star formation rate over that redshift interval .",
    "this suggests a possible relationship between star formation and weak  absorbers , which is also consistent with their high metallicities and ( in at least some cases ) iron abundances @xcite .",
    "we should therefore consider how the global star formation rate relates to the results of our @xmath99 survey .",
    "the global star formation rate is roughly constant over the redshift range @xmath105 , and then decreases to lower redshifts ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "if production of weak  absorbers was directly correlated with the global star formation rate we would expect a @xmath25 at @xmath77 consistent with a constant creation rate , subject to the ebr and to cosmological evolution .",
    "our observation of a smaller @xmath25 than this expectation would suggest that the global star formation rate should be smaller at @xmath77 than at @xmath100 .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "however , we need to consider that weak  absorbers are preferentially found in certain environments .",
    "theoretically , in the context of hierarchical structure formation and empirically on the basis of the morphology  density relationship , it is expected that star formation peaks later in low mass galaxies @xcite .",
    "more directly , @xcite found a shift over the range @xmath106 in the relative contributions of low and high mass galaxies to the global star formation rate , with low mass galaxies contibuting more at low redshift .",
    "although measurements of the dwarf galaxy contribution have not yet extended to higher redshifts , it seems likely that the star formation rate in dwarfs peaks at a lower redshift than that for giants .",
    "given the constant global star formation rate at @xmath107 @xcite , if the giants are contributing relatively more at high redshift , the dwarfs must contribute less .",
    "given previous suggestions that weak  absorbers are related to dwarfs , it is intriguing that the peak epoch of weak  absorbers may coincide with the peak of star formation in the dwarf environment .",
    "@xcite estimate that weak  absorbers account for approximately 25%-100% of  forest clouds with @xmath108^{-2}$ ] at @xmath13 . at first glance",
    "it seems surprising that the redshift path density for  forest clouds would sharply decrease with decreasing @xmath40 until @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) @xcite , while we find the weak  absorber population to increase over the same interval .",
    "however , if the weak  absorbers are closely related to star formation in dwarfs , as we have suggested , then there is no reason to expect a direct correlation of their evolution with the evolution of the  forest , the latter which is explained by cosmological expansion .",
