    "studying the properties of neutron stars , which are among the most mysterious objects in the universe , allows us to test our knowledge of matter under extreme conditions .",
    "theoretical studies have shown that neutron stars are expected to have a liquid core surrounded by a solid inner crust  @xcite , which extends outward to the neutron drip - out region . while the neutron drip - out density @xmath6 is relatively well determined to be about @xmath7 g/@xmath8 or @xmath9  @xcite , the transition density @xmath10 at the inner edge is still largely uncertain mainly because of our very limited knowledge on the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) , especially the density dependence of the symmetry energy ( @xmath11 ) of neutron - rich nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "these uncertainties have hampered our understanding of many important properties of neutron stars  @xcite and related astrophysical observations  @xcite .",
    "recently , significant progress has been made in constraining the eos of neutron - rich nuclear matter using terrestrial laboratory experiments ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the most recent review ) .",
    "in particular , the analysis of the isospin - diffusion data @xcite in heavy - ion collisions has constrained tightly the @xmath11 in exactly the same sub - saturation density region around the expected inner edge of neutron star crust .",
    "the extracted slope parameter @xmath12 in the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy was found to be @xmath13 mev , which has further been confirmed by a more recent analysis  @xcite . with this constrained nuclear symmetry energy ,",
    "we have obtained an improved determination of the values for the transition density and pressure at the inner edge of neutron star crusts .",
    "this has led us to obtain significantly different values for the radius of the vela pulsar from those estimated previously .",
    "also , we have found that the widely used parabolic approximation ( pa ) to the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter gives much larger values for the transition density and pressure , especially for stiff symmetry energies .",
    "the transition density at the inner edge of neutron star crusts can be determined using the dynamical  @xcite and the thermodynamical approaches  @xcite as well as the approach based on the random phase approximation ( rpa )  @xcite .",
    "our study was based on the dynamical and thermodynamical approaches .    in the dynamical approach",
    ", the stability condition for a homogeneous @xmath14 matter against small periodic density perturbations can be well approximated by bps71,bbp71,pet95a , pet95b , oya07 @xmath15where @xmath16 is the wavevector of the spatially periodic density perturbations and @xmath17with @xmath18 being the chemical potential of particle type @xmath19 .",
    "the three terms in eq .",
    "( [ vdyn ] ) represent , respectively , the contributions from the bulk nuclear matter , the density - gradient ( surface ) terms , and the coulomb interaction . for the coefficients of density - gradient terms , we use the empirical values of @xmath20 mev@xmath21@xmath22 , which are consistent with those from the skyrme - hartree - fock calculations  oya07,xclm09 . at @xmath23^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath24 has the minimal value of @xmath25  @xcite , and @xmath10 is then determined from @xmath26 .    in the thermodynamical approach ,",
    "the stability conditions for the @xmath14 matter are  @xcite @xmath27 in the above , @xmath28 is the total pressure of the @xmath14 matter with @xmath29 and @xmath30 being the contributions from baryons and electrons , respectively ; @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the volume and charge per baryon number ; and @xmath33 is the chemical potential of the @xmath14 matter .",
    "it can be shown that the first inequality in eq .",
    "( [ ther1 ] ) is equivalent to requiring a positive bulk term @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ vdyn ] )  @xcite , while the second inequality in eq .",
    "( [ ther1 ] ) is almost always satisfied .",
    "therefore , the thermodynamical stability conditions are simply the limit of the dynamical one for @xmath35 when the surface terms and the coulomb interaction are neglected .",
    "we have used in our study a momentum - dependent mdi interaction that is based on the modified finite - range gogny effective interaction @xcite .",
    "this interaction , which has been extensively studied in our previous work  @xcite , is exactly the one used in analyzing the isospin diffusion data from heavy - ion reactions  @xcite .     as a function of the slope parameter @xmath36 of the nuclear symmetry energy from the dynamical and thermodynamical approaches with and without the parabolic approximation in the mdi interaction . taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . ]    shown in fig .",
    "[ rhotl ] is the transition density @xmath10 as a function of the slope parameter @xmath36 of the symmetry energy from the mdi interaction . for comparisons ,",
    "we have included results from both the dynamical and thermodynamical approaches with the full eos and its parabolic approximation , i.e. , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the isospin asymmetry , from the same mdi interaction . with the full mdi eos , @xmath10 is seen to decrease almost linearly with increasing @xmath36 in both approaches consistent with the results obtained in rpa  @xcite .",
    "both dynamical and thermodynamical approaches give very similar results with the former having slightly smaller @xmath10 than the later ( the difference is actually less than @xmath3 @xmath1 ) , and this is due to the fact that the density - gradient and coulomb terms in the dynamical approach make the system more stable and thus lower the transition density .",
    "the small difference between the two approaches implies that the effects of density - gradient terms and coulomb term are , however , unimportant in determining @xmath10 . on the other hand , significantly larger transition densities are obtained in the parabolic approximation , including the predictions by kubis using the mdi eos in the thermodynamical approach  @xcite , especially for stiffer symmetry energies ( larger @xmath36 values ) .",
    "the large error introduced by the parabolic approach is understandable since the @xmath39-stable @xmath14 matter is usually highly neutron - rich and the contribution from the higher - order terms in @xmath40 is thus appreciable .",
    "this is especially the case for the stiffer symmetry energy which generally leads to a more neutron - rich @xmath41 matter at subsaturation densities .",
    "furthermore , because of the energy curvatures involved in the stability conditions , larger factors are multiplied to the contributions from higher - order terms in the eos than that multiplied to the quadratic term .",
    "these features agree with the early finding @xcite that the transition density @xmath42 is very sensitive to the fine details of the nuclear eos . according to results from the more complete and realistic dynamical approach , the constrained @xmath36 limits the transition density to @xmath0 @xmath43 @xmath2 @xmath1 as shown in fig .",

    "again , it is seen that the pa leads to huge errors for large ( small ) @xmath36 ( @xmath10 ) values . for the full mdi eos ,",
    "the @xmath46 decreases ( increases ) with increasing @xmath36 ( @xmath10 ) while it displays a complex relation with @xmath36 or @xmath10 in pa . from the constrained @xmath36 values",
    ", the value of @xmath46 is limited between @xmath3 mev/@xmath4 and @xmath47 mev/@xmath4 .",
    "the constrained values of @xmath10 and @xmath46 have important implications in many properties of neutron stars  @xcite . as an example",
    ", we have examined their effect on constraining the mass - radius ( @xmath48-@xmath49 ) correlation of neutron stars .",
    "the crustal fraction of the total moment of inertia @xmath50 of a neutron star can be well approximated by  @xcite @xmath51 ^{-1 } ,   \\label{di}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath52 is the baryon mass and @xmath53 with @xmath54 being the gravitational constant . as stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath50 depends sensitively on the symmetry energy at subsaturation densities through @xmath45 and @xmath55 , but there is no explicit dependence on the higher - density eos .",
    "so far , the only known limit of @xmath56 was extracted from studying the glitches of vela pulsar @xcite .",
    "this together with the upper bounds on @xmath45 and @xmath55 ( @xmath57 @xmath1 and @xmath58 mev/@xmath4 ) sets approximately a minimum radius of @xmath59 km for the vela pulsar .",
    "the radius of vela pulsar is predicted to exceed @xmath60 km should it have a mass of @xmath61 .",
    "we notice that a constraint of @xmath62 km for this pulsar has previously been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite by using @xmath63 @xmath1 and @xmath64 mev/@xmath4 .",
    "however , the constraint obtained in our study using for the first time data from both the terrestrial laboratory experiments and astrophysical observations is more stringent .",
    "-@xmath49 of static neutron stars from the full eos and its parabolic approximation in the mdi interaction with @xmath65 and @xmath66 . for the vela pulsar",
    ", the constraint of @xmath56 limits the allowed masses and radii .",
    "see text for details .",
    "taken from ref .",
    "@xcite with small modifications . ]",
    "the above constraints are shown in fig .",
    "[ mr ] together with the m@xmath67r relation obtained by solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation . in the latter ,",
    "we have used the well - known bps eos @xcite for the outer crust . in the inner crust with @xmath68 the eos is largely uncertain and following ref .",
    "@xcite , we use an eos of the form @xmath69 with the constants @xmath70 and @xmath71 determined by the total pressure @xmath72 and total energy density @xmath73 at @xmath74 and @xmath10 .",
    "the full mdi eos and its parabolic approximation with @xmath65 and @xmath66 are used for the uniform liquid core with @xmath75 . assuming that the core consists of only the @xmath14 matter without possible new degrees of freedom or phase transitions at high densities , the pa leads to a larger radius for a fixed mass compared to the full mdi eos .",
    "furthermore , using the full mdi eos with @xmath65 and @xmath66 constrained by the heavy - ion reaction experiments , the radius of a canonical neutron star of @xmath61 is tightly constrained within @xmath76 km to @xmath77 km .",
    "using the mdi eos of neutron - rich nuclear matter constrained by recent isospin diffusion data from heavy - ion reactions in the same sub - saturation density range as the neutron star crust , we have determined the density and pressure at the inner edge , that separates the liquid core from the solid crust of neutron stars , to be @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath1 and @xmath3 mev/@xmath4 @xmath5 mev/@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "these constraints have allowed us to determine an improved mass - radius relation for neutron stars .",
