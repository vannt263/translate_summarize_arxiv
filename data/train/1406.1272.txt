    "casimir effect plays an important role in various areas of physics and mathematics such as quantum field theory , gravitation and cosmology , atomic physics , condensed matter , nanotechnology and mathematical physics ( see e.g. @xcite ) . from the perspective of quantum field theory ,",
    "casimir effect is closely related to the one - loop effective action @xcite . since the beginning of the last century ,",
    "physicists have explored higher dimensional spacetime models to solve some fundamental problems such as the unification of fundamental forces and the dark energy and cosmological constant problem .",
    "this has motivated the study of casimir effect in spacetime with arbitrary dimensions @xcite .    before the turn of this century",
    ", the studies of casimir interaction were concentrated on the parallel plate configuration due to the lack of machineries to compute the casimir interactions between arbitrary objects . for other configurations such as the sphere - plate configuration which is a popular experimental setup ,",
    "proximity force approximation was employed to compute the approximation to the casimir interaction when the separation between the objects is very small compared to the diameter of the objects . however , the situation changed drastically in the beginning of this century .",
    "various approaches have been proposed to compute the casimir interaction between two objects in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional minkowski spacetime which can either be classified as worldline method @xcite , multiple scattering approach @xcite or mode summation approach @xcite .",
    "generalizing the prescription in @xcite to arbitrary dimensions , we have been able to compute the zero temperature casimir interaction between a sphere and a plate @xcite and between two spheres @xcite in @xmath0-dimensional minkowski spacetime .",
    "motivated by the work @xcite which shows that the high temperature limit of the dirichlet casimir interaction of the sphere - plate and sphere - sphere configurations can be computed exactly , we have computed the high temperature limit of the dirichlet sphere - plate interaction in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we generalize both the works @xcite and @xcite and consider the casimir interaction between two dirichlet spheres at finite temperature in @xmath0-dimensional minkowski spacetime . in the high temperature limit , we show that the casimir interaction can also be computed exactly .",
    "we then proceed to compute the the leading order term and next - to - leading order terms of the small separation asymptotic expansions of the casimir interaction at any temperature .",
    "explicit formulas were derived for the low temperature , medium temperature as well as high temperature regions .",
    "we use units where @xmath2 .",
    "in this work , we consider the finite temperature casimir interaction between two spheres with radii @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively . without loss of generality",

    "in this section , we derive an alternative expression for the classical casimir interaction energy using similarity transforms of matrices .",

    "the small separation asymptotic expansion of the casimir interaction is in general not easy to compute .",
    "one usually expects that the leading term would coincide with the proximity force approximation .",
    "however , the computation of the next - to - leading order term is often tedious , but it captures important information of the casimir interaction such as the response of the system to the curvature of the surfaces , and it also gives a rough idea of how accurate the leading term is .",

    "<S> we consider the finite temperature casimir interaction between two dirichlet spheres in @xmath0-dimensional minkowski spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> the casimir interaction free energy is derived from the zero temperature casimir interaction energy via the matsubara formalism . in the high temperature region , </S>",
    "<S> the casimir interaction is dominated by the term with zero matsubara frequency , and it is known as the classical term since this term is independent of the planck constant @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> explicit expression of the classical term is derived and it is computed exactly using appropriate similarity transforms of matrices . </S>",
    "<S> we then compute the small separation asymptotic expansion of this classical term up to the next - to - leading order term . </S>",
    "<S> for the remaining part of the finite temperature casimir interaction with nonzero matsubara frequencies , we obtain its small separation asymptotic behavior by applying certain prescriptions to the corresponding asymptotic expansion at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this gives us a leading term that is shown to agree precisely with the proximity force approximation at any temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the next - to - leading order term at any temperature is also derived and it is expressed as an infinite sum over integrals . to obtain the asymptotic expansion at the low and medium temperature regions , we apply the inverse mellin transform techniques . in the low temperature region , we obtain results that agree with our previous work on the zero temperature casimir interaction . </S>"
