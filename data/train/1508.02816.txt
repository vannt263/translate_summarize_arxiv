    "massive star and star cluster formation are key processes for understanding galaxy evolution , since massive stars are vital sources of feedback for regulating the interstellar medium ( ism ) and further star formation activity , while star clusters are the basic building blocks of galactic stellar populations . despite this importance , we understand massive star and star cluster formation only very poorly because the regions forming such objects are relatively rare and thus typically far away ( at least a few kpcs for most galactic sources ) and also deeply embedded inside dense molecular clouds .    a better understanding of massive star and star cluster formation should result if we can find and characterize the initial conditions of these processes .",
    "two key methods to achieve this involve studying the amount of ir extinction and sub - mm / mm emission of dust grains in cold , dense regions of molecular clouds in order to measure mass surface densities and thus masses of cloud structures ( see , e.g , tan et al .",
    "2014 , for a review , hereafter t14 ) . to do this accurately",
    ", one needs to know the opacities and emissivities of the dust grains , including potential systematic evolution in these properties .",
    "this is the goal of our study .",
    "a better understanding of dust properties will also be important for modeling heating and cooling in the clouds , astrochemistry , and the ionization fraction , which affects dynamics by enabling coupling of the mostly neutral gas to magnetic fields .",
    "the nir to fir properties of dust extinction ( from 1 to 25  @xmath7 ) have been measured in the lupus molecular cloud using background stars by boogert et al .",
    "they found evidence for water ice ( presumably forming on dust grains ) on sightlines with @xmath8  mag and that with increasing @xmath9 the @xmath10 continuum extinction increases relative to @xmath9 .",
    "the most extincted line of sight that they probed had @xmath11  mag ( @xmath12  mag ) .",
    "these are relatively low mass surface density conditions compared to the clouds that are thought to form massive stars and star clusters ( t14 ) .",
    "lutz et al . ( 1996 ) studied the mir extinction law ( from 2.5 to 9  @xmath7 ) towards the galactic center using hydrogen recombination lines .",
    "they found a relatively flat extinction law , e.g. , compared to bare grain models of draine ( 1989 ) .",
    "this sightline has @xmath13  mag , but is essentially probing diffuse ism conditions that are not likely to be close to initial conditions for star formation .",
    "mcclure ( 2009 ) studied 5 to 20  @xmath14 dust extinction properties on sightlines through molecular clouds with @xmath15 towards background stars , finding systematic evolution with increasing @xmath9 that was attributed to ice - mantle mediated grain coagulation ( see also flaherty et al .",

    "they are occasionally opaque at far - infrared wavelengths , up to @xmath18 , against the galactic diffuse background emission ( e.g. , lim & tan 2014 , hereafter lt14 ) due to their very high mass surface densities @xmath19 ( @xmath20  mag ) and cold @xmath21  k temperatures . being massive clouds with such physical conditions , irdcs are likely to be representative of the initial conditions for massive star and star cluster formation ( t14 ) .",
    "butler and tan ( 2009 , 2012 ; hereafter bt09 , bt12 ) studied mass surface densities , @xmath22 , of 42 starless cores inside 10  irdcs via mir extinction ( mirex ) mapping by utilizing _",
    "spitzer_-irac @xmath3 data of the glimpse survey ( churchwell et al .",

    "the advantages of such mirex mapping are high angular resolution ( 2@xmath23 ) , a near - fully sampled image ( except in regions of bright mir emission ) and an independence to dust temperature ( except , again , in very warm regions that are sources of mir emission ) .",
    "a major uncertainty is the need to estimate the background intensity by interpolation from regions around the cloud .",
    "the background intensity can also have significant small scale fluctuations , which however can be assessed from the off - cloud regions , but which are an inherent random uncertainty .",
    "another major issue is the need to estimate the level of the mir foreground intensity from the diffuse ism , since irdcs are typically at several kpc distances .",
    "the key method to estimate the foreground is to measure it empirically in spatially independent `` saturated '' regions of the irdc where essentially negligible background light makes it through the cloud ( as long as such regions exist ) , and then assume it is spatially invariant across the irdc or some local region ( bt12 ) .",
    "the accuracy of measuring the saturated intensity level depends on the photometric precision of the image and sets a maximum @xmath24 that can be probed in the map .",
    "mirex mapping does require knowing the @xmath25 opacity per unit mass : different dust models , such as the thin and thick ossenkopf and henning ( 1994 , hereafter oh94 ) moderately coagulated models or the weingartner & draine ( 2001 ) bare grain models , show only modest variation at the level of @xmath26 .",
    "then a ( refractory)-dust to gas mass ratio also needs to be assumed ( 1:142 ) is our adopted fiducial value ( draine 2011 ; note bt09 and bt12 assumed 1:156 ) .",
    "overall , bt09 , bt12 and btk14 adopted the oh94 thin ice mantle model ( @xmath27  years of coagulation at density @xmath28@xmath29 ) as a fiducial , which has @xmath30 ( averaged over the irac band ) @xmath317.5",

    "such behavior is consistent with an evolution from the oh94 thin ice mantle model to the thick ice mantle model , in which there is a growth of the volume of the ice cover from 0.5@xmath40 that of the refractory component to 4.5@xmath40 .",

    "the firex results at @xmath146 suggest this flattening extends out to these long wavelengths and is also stronger in higher density environments .",
    "comparison with oh94 and o11 dust models suggests that this may require some combination of water ice mantle growth and grain coagulation .",
    "one implication of these results is that there could be very significant grain growth on large scales within irdcs , so that pre - stellar cores should be modeled with such large grains .",
