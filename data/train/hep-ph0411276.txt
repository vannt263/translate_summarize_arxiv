    "we live in exciting times for particle physics .",
    "the tevatron run ii program is producing new physics results , which will be followed by the startup of the lhc in three years .",
    "these machines have a rich physics menu of new physics searches , precision measurements , qcd studies , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 quark physics , and much more .",
    "we are in an enviable position .",
    "we have an electroweak theory which is consistent with all data , but which predicts new physics waiting to be discovered at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "when the lhc begins accumulating data , the physics landscape will change dramatically : the number of observed top quark pairs will jump from @xmath4 at the tevatron to @xmath5 in the first @xmath6 at the lhc .",
    "similarly , the number of @xmath7 pairs in our world data set will increase from @xmath8 from the @xmath9 factories at slac and kek to @xmath10 at the lhc .",
    "we are confident in our predictions that the wealth of new data at the lhc will guarantee new discoveries .    in this note , we begin by reviewing new measurements of the top quark and @xmath11 boson masses and their implications for electroweak physics .",
    "we continue by discussing the emergence of the tevatron as a machine for precsion studies .",
    "finally , we conclude by emphasizing our certainty that new physics discoveries are just around the corner .",
    "two of the most interesting results of the last year were the new values for the top quark and the @xmath11 boson masses .",
    "a review of other electroweak measurements at the tevatron can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in 2003 , we had for the world average for the top quark mass@xcite , @xmath12 the d0 collaboration improved their run i analysis to include matrix element calculations , and this analysis dominates the new world average . in 2004 , we have the new combination of run i results@xcite , @xmath13 this value for @xmath14 is most sensitive to the d0 lepton plus jets result .",
    "as the tevatron run ii program continues , we expect ever more accurate measurements of the top quark mass@xcite .",
    "the top quark mass plays a special role in the standard model . in qed ,",
    "the running of @xmath15 at a scale @xmath16 is not affected by heavy quarks with @xmath17 .",
    "the decoupling theorem tells us that diagrams with heavy virtual particles do nt contribute to experimental observables at scales @xmath18 if two conditions are met :    * coupling constants do nt grow with @xmath19 , and * the gauge theory with the heavy quark removed is still renormalizable .",
    "the spontaneously broken @xmath20 gauge theory violates both conditions and we expect large effects from virtual diagrams involving the top quark , with effects from virtual top quarks growing quadratically with @xmath21 .",
    "a small change in the top quark mass therefore has large effects in the inferred predictions of the standard model .",
    "the @xmath11 boson is produced at the tevatron through the partonic sub - process , @xmath22 , and the leptonic decays of the @xmath11 can be used to determine the @xmath11 mass and width to good precision through a measurement of the transverse @xmath11 mass or the @xmath23 of the lepton .",
    "the run i value for the @xmath11 mass from a combination of cdf and d0 data is @xmath24@xcite . at lep2 ,",
    "the @xmath11 boson was pair produced through the process , @xmath25 , ( see fig .",
    "[ eeww_fig ] ) , and a value for the @xmath11 mass was found of @xmath26 .",
    "the run i and lep2 values have been combined to give a new world average for the @xmath11 mass of@xcite @xmath27 this is slightly lower than the previous value , @xmath28",
    "the result of the new top quark mass is to shift the best fit value for the higgs boson mass as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fg : higsfit]@xcite , @xmath29 the small shift in the top quark mass , @xmath30 shifted the @xmath31 confidence level limit on the higgs mass by roughly @xmath32 .",
    "the best fit for the higgs mass is now and @xmath14 from the tevatron are included in the fit .",
    "a fit to the higgs mass without the @xmath11 mass measurement gives a best fit value of @xmath33 , while a fit which does not include @xmath14 or @xmath34 as measured at the tevtraon gives @xmath35.]@xcite @xmath36 it is reassuring to see that the best fit value is not in the region excluded by the direct search experiments at lep .",
    "( the best fit value of 2003 was @xmath37 , a value which is excluded by the direct search experiments . )    the global fit of the experimental data to the parameters of the standard model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : globfit ] and is in spectacular agreement with the predictions of the standard model .",
    "the fits have been redone using the new value of @xmath14 and only the high @xmath38 data is included in the 2004 fits .",
    "the results of the low energy experiments such as atomic parity violation in cesium , neutrino - nucleon scattering ( nutev ) , and moller scattering ( @xmath39 ) are now predicted results .",
    "the prediction of the global fit for @xmath40 is in good agreement with the value of eq .",
    "[ topeq ] , while the best fit value for @xmath34 ( with the experimental value of @xmath14 included in the fit ) is slightly lower than the experimental value@xcite , @xmath41    the puzzles of the global fit from previous years remain .",
    "the extracted value of @xmath42 still has the problem that measurements from experiments with leptons and from experiments with hadrons disagree by @xmath43@xcite .",
    "using the value of @xmath42 found from leptons at sld ( @xmath44 ) , @xmath45 a value of the higgs boson mass in conflict with the direct search experiments is predicted . on the other hand , using @xmath42 from the forward backward @xmath2 asymmetry at lep ( @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 one obtains a prediction in disagreement with the measured value of @xmath34 .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fg : swfit ] .",
    "it is extremely difficult to construct models which explain this feature .",
    "measurements at low energy test our understanding of the energy scaling of the theory .",
    "the best fit values for the parameters of the standard model which are given in fig .",
    "[ fg : globfit ] can be used to make predictions for moller scattering , for the value of @xmath48 which is extracted from nutev experiment , and for atomic parity violation in cesium , and then compared with the experimental values .",
    "the energy dependence of the weak mixing angle @xmath48 is predicted in the standard model and is shown as the solid line in fig .",
    "[ ee ] and we see that the results of the low energy experiments are in reasonable , although not perfect , agreement with the predictions of the standard model except for the nutev result@xcite .    the nutev collaboration has published its result for the ratio of neutral currents to charged currents in neutrino - nucleon scattering . when the measurement is interpreted in terms of @xmath48 ,",
    "it is @xmath49 away from the global fit@xcite : @xmath50 the nutev experiment is under intense theoretical scrutiny since connecting the experimental observables with theoretical predictions requires a detailed understanding of theory .",
    "a number of possible solutions to the discrepancy between theory and experiment have been proposed , including an asymmetry in the strange / anti - strange parton distributions@xcite , and the effects of higher order @xmath51 corrections@xcite    the situation with atomic parity violation has improved since the 2002 global fit showed a @xmath52 deviation of the experiment from the global fit .",
    "there is a new calculation of qed corrections which is now in good agreement with the best fit value@xcite @xmath53    moller scattering ( @xmath54 ) provides a clean measurement of the weak mixing angle since it is a purely leptonic process .",
    "a cominbination of the e158 experiment at slac run i , ii and iii data gives the result@xcite , @xmath55 in good agreement with the theoretical prediction , @xmath56    the inclusion of the low @xmath38 results into the fit has very little effect on the higgs mass limits .",
    "the conclusion from the electroweak fits is that electroweak physics is in even better shape this year than last year !",
    "the standard model continues to be tested at the tevatron . in the coming few years",
    ", we can expect that the properties of standard model particles will be measured with high precision . @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath57 gauge bosons have large cross sections at the tevatron , so high statistics and precision measurements will dominate : @xmath11 and @xmath57 masses and width measurements , production cross sections , and gauge boson pair production cross sections .",
    "measurements of the top quark mass and top quark properties will continue to unfold , along with higgs searches , new physics searches , @xmath2 physics , and qcd studies , to name just a few areas .",
    "this conference saw a large number of new results in these areas from the d0 and cdf collaborations .",
    "the top quark plays a leading role in many models with physics beyond the standard model , so measurements of top quark properties play an especially important role in constraining these models .",
    "one particularly important measurement which we look forward to in the future is single top production .",
    "single top production at the tevatron has a total rate of roughly @xmath58@xcite , approximately half that of top pair production , and can serve to measure the ckm mixing parameter , @xmath59 .",
    "d0 has looked for single top production in @xmath60 and @xmath61 of run ii data and finds the @xmath62 limits@xcite , @xmath63 while cdf finds the corresponding @xmath62 limits@xcite , @xmath64    the production of @xmath11 and @xmath57 bosons tests the qcd production mechanism , while the ratio of the production cross section times the leptonic branching ratios can be used to extract the @xmath11 boson total width . figs .",
    "[ figw ] and [ figz ] show the results of @xmath65 of data from d0 , and @xmath66 from cdf , for @xmath11 production with the decay @xmath67 and for @xmath57 production followed by the leptonic decay , @xmath68 , along with a comparison to the standard model prediction .",
    "there is good agreement with the standard model predictions .    a particularly interesting set of results concerns two gauge boson production , which is sensitive to the three gauge boson vertices , and hence to the non - abelian nature of the theory . the results from lep2 for @xmath69 ( fig .",
    "[ eeww_fig ] ) show that the three gauge boson couplings are very close to their standard model values . in an effective theory where",
    "there is new physics at a higher energy scale , the non - standard model contributions to the three gauge boson couplings would grow like @xmath70@xcite and we can expect enhanced couplings at the tevatron and lhc .",
    "preliminary measurements@xcite of the @xmath71 pair production cross section at the tevatron show good agreement with next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd predictions and no indication of non - standard model gauge couplings@xcite , @xmath72      advances in theory go hand in hand with higher statistics measurements at the tevatron .",
    "the strong coupling constant is not small : @xmath73 emission of soft gluons and multi - particle states are important , along with large effects from higher order perturbative qcd corrections .",
    "understanding precision measurements at the tevatron and the lhc requires new tools and the systematic inclusion of higher order qcd effects .",
    "this in turn requires new techniques for computing the higher order corrections .",
    "many processes are now calculated at next - to - next - to leading order ( nnlo ) .",
    "not only total cross sections@xcite , but also kinematic distributions for a few processes are becoming available at nnlo .",
    "for example , predictions for the drell - yan rapidity computed to nnlo in perturbative qcd at the lhc are shown in fig .",
    "[ drellyan_fig]@xcite ,    we see the very small error bar due to the scale dependence at nnlo .",
    "this suggests that it may be possible to use drell yan production to measure parton distribution functions at nnlo .",
    "understanding the precise data from the tevatron and future data from the lhc will require monte carlo programs which incorporate physics at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in perturbative qcd .",
    "there are several programs on the market .",
    "the mc@nlo program matches parton showering calculations at low @xmath23 with exact nlo matrix element calculations at high @xmath23@xcite .",
    "an example of the importance of properly incorportating higher order effects is the @xmath2 production cross section at the tevatron , which has been a long standing puzzle . by including the higher order qcd corrections in both the production and the fragmentation functions",
    ", the theoretical prediction now agrees quite well with the data , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ bfig]@xcite .",
    "another approach to including higher order qcd corrections is the mcfm monte carlo program@xcite .",
    "this program includes exact matrix element calculations for both the signal and background processes for a number of processes at hadron colliders . for most processes , the matrix elements are included to next - to - leading order and",
    "the full set of spin correlations is included for the decays .",
    "despite the successes of the standard model , the arguments for new physics at the @xmath0 scale have never been stronger .",
    "many of the questions particle physicists seek to answer become even more pressing as accelerators approach the @xmath0 energy scale :    * the question of naturalness : why is @xmath34 so much smaller than @xmath74 ? * dark matter : what is it ?",
    "why is there so much of it ?",
    "* neutrino masses : where do they come from",
    "? why are they so small ? * what mechanism restores unitarity to the @xmath75 scattering amplitude : is there a light higgs ?",
    "is there some other mechanism ?",
    "extensions of the standard model which have been proposed in various attempts to answer these questions almost uniformly predict physics beyond that of the standard model at the @xmath0 energy scale@xcite .",
    "so even though current results from lep and the tevatron support the experimental validity of the standard model , we are confident that there is new physics just around the corner .    furthermore , the higgs sector of the standard model is unsatisfactory to theorists .",
    "light scalar particles , such as the higgs boson , are unnatural in the sense that the scalar higgs mass depends quadratically on new physics which may exist at a higher energy scale . in order to have a higgs boson mass below @xmath76 ( as suggested by the precision electroweak measurements ) , large cancellations between various contributions to the higgs boson mass are required .",
    "attempts to avoid this problem have led to an explosion of model building in recent years@xcite .",
    "models of new physics are highly constrained by precision measurements .",
    "new physics effects can be parameterized in a model independent fashion by adding a tower of dimension six operators to the standard model : @xmath77 precision measurements place significant limits on many possible operators .",
    "for example , current data requires@xcite , @xmath78 a more complete list of constraints on dimension 6 operators is given in ref .",
    "operators which violate flavor conservation are even more tightly constrained , often requiring scales @xmath79 .",
    "the fact that physics at the @xmath80 scale may already be excluded experimentally is termed the `` little hierarchy '' problem .",
    "* remove the higgs boson completely : models of this type include models with dynamical symmetry breaking@xcite and higgsless models in extra dimensions@xcite . * lower the cut - off scale @xmath81 of eq .",
    "[ ops ] : examples of this class of models are models with large extra dimensions@xcite . * force cancellations between contributions to the higgs boson mass",
    ": supersymmetric models are the favorite of this type , while little higgs models are a new entrant into the theory game ( although they have difficulty being consistent with precision measurements@xcite . )",
