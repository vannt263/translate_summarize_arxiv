    "in the last years , a new kind of magnetic compounds , the magnetic molecules , has been drawing the attention of physicists as well as chemists @xcite .",
    "such molecules each contain a large number ( typically , 10 to 20 ) of paramagnetic ions ( such as mn , fe or cu ) coupled by exchange interactions .",
    "each molecule , therefore , presents a mesoscopic system that is neither totally microscopic , nor totally macroscopic , but where micro- and macroscopic behavior coexist .",
    "these materials are promising for various practical applications @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the coexistence of quantum and classical behavior in the clusters makes them very suitable objects for study of macroscopic quantum effects in spin systems @xcite .",
    "these studies , clarifying many problems of quantum theory of measurements @xcite , are also important for development of a physical basis for practical implementation of powerful algorithms of quantum computations , quantum cryptography and quantum searching @xcite .",
    "particularly , the @xmath1 molecules ( below referred to as mn@xmath0 ) recently became a subject of great interest .",
    "each molecule @xcite contains a cluster of twelve manganese ions surrounded by acetate radicals and water molecules .",
    "the ground state of the clusters corresponds to a large total spin @xmath2 .",
    "the clusters possess a strong easy - axis anisotropy : the zero - field splitting between the states with @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the value of @xmath6-projection of the total cluster spin ) is 14.4 k. being stacked into a crystal , the molecules form a tetragonal lattice ; in so doing the magnetic interactions between different clusters are very small ( of order of 10@xmath7 t ) .",
    "thus , the crystal consisting of these molecules can be considered as an assembly of ideal noninteracting superparamagnetic entities , each being identical to the others .",
    "these clusters have been successfully used for the study of mesoscopic quantum effects . in particular ,",
    "resonant magnetization tunneling has been unambigously registered in experiments on mn@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "moreover , there are experimental results @xcite supporting the hypothesis of `` ground state - to - ground state '' tunneling in mn@xmath0 below 2 k ( for more detailed discussion , see sec .  [ sectrelax ] ) .",
    "however , the progress in understanding the physical properties of mn@xmath0 is greatly hampered by the lack of an adequate description of these clusters .",
    "indeed , the description of mn@xmath0 as a single spin @xmath2 entity has been the starting point in most works devoted to this subject .",
    "we know of only a few theoretical attempts to account for the internal spin structure of the cluster @xcite , but even in these the relativistic anisotropic interactions have not been taken into account . in view of recent experiments",
    "@xcite showing that the single - spin model is seriously deficient , it is worthwhile reconsidering the many - spin aspects of mn@xmath0 .",
    "in this paper we focus on the many - spin interactions in mn@xmath0 clusters .",
    "we account for not only isotropic exchange interactions between ions in the cluster , but also various anisotropic interactions possibly present in mn@xmath0 .",
    "based on the results , we propose a spin hamiltonian for these clusters .",
    "we show that this hamiltonian can reproduce satisfactorily most recent experimental results , such as positions of neutron scattering peaks , high - frequency epr data and the experimental dependence of the magnetic susceptibility on temperature .",
    "we note that the account of anisotropic interactions , especially the dzyaloshinsky - morya interaction ( which has been missing up to now ) , is crucial for a detailed description of the experimental data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sectham ] we derive and discuss the spin hamiltonian for this model .",

    "the cluster mn@xmath0 , schematically shown in fig .   [ figmn1 ] , consists of eight mn@xmath8 ions having the spin 2 and four mn@xmath9 ions having the spin 3/2 .",
    "the ions are coupled by exchange interactions , indicated in fig .",
    "[ figmn1 ] by different lines connecting the ions .",
    "the values of the exchange integrals are not known , but estimates are given in ref .",
    ": @xmath10 @xmath11 ( afm exchange ) , @xmath12 @xmath11 and @xmath13 @xmath11 .",
    "these values are rough , but describe correctly the scale of exchange interactions in mn@xmath0 .",
    "recent experiments @xcite show that the excitations with spin values @xmath14 are rather close to the ground state : the distance is 4060 k ( values differ in different reports ) .",
    "this is less than the energy of some states with the spin @xmath2 ( namely , the states @xmath15 ) , i.e.  the lower states of the manifold @xmath16 are lower than the higher states of the manifold @xmath2 .",
    "thus , an adequate description of mn@xmath0 should account for the excitations with @xmath14 ; i.e.   the cluster should be considered as a many - spin system .",
    "the total number of spin states in mn@xmath0 is large even for modern computers .",
    "but we can employ the fact that the exchange antiferromagnetic interactions @xmath17 ( see fig .  [ figmn1 ] ) are much larger than all the others @xcite , so corresponding pairs of ions mn@xmath8 and mn@xmath9 form dimers with the total spin @xmath18 ( one of this pairs is designated in fig .",
    "[ figmn1 ] , it includes ions @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) . this model has already been successfully used for description of spin states of the cluster @xcite . its validity is proven by megagauss - field experiments @xcite : the states of dimers with the spin @xmath21 higher than 1/2 ( excitations of dimers ) come into play when the external magnetic field is about 400 t , i.e.  the excitations of dimers have energy about 370 @xmath11 .",
    "analogously , the dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of the cluster versus temperature @xcite shows that the dimer excitations contribute when temperature becomes as high as 150200 k.    based on these data , we can analyze the domain of validity of the `` dimerized '' model . to do this",
    ", we note that the exchange interactions @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 mix the ground state of a dimer with the dimer excitations , and the approximation of spin-1/2 dimers corresponds to the zeroth order perturbation theory with @xmath25 as an expansion parameter ( similar approach has been used in ref .  ) .    to clarify this point , let us consider the level @xmath26 having , to the zeroth order , the energy @xmath27 with respect to the ground state .",
    "let us denote the distance between the ground state and the excitation of dimer as @xmath28 @xmath11 .",
    "the first - order correction to the energy of the level @xmath26 is of the order of @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the magnitude of exchange interactions between dimers and nondimerized spins ( see below ) .",
    "thus , accounting for the first - order corrections , the distance between the ground state and the level @xmath26 becomes @xmath31,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is a factor of order of unity , depending on the specific level @xmath26 . as will be shown below",
    ", @xmath30 is of order of 70 @xmath11 ; so the first - order correction for the levels with energies about 70 @xmath11 is already considerable , of order of 4 @xmath11 .",
    "this estimate , though being rough , gives the correct order of magnitude of the error introduced by the dimerized 8-spin model .",
    "moreover , this error restricts the region of temperatures where the dimerized model can be successfully applied .",
    "e.g. , as our calculations show , to obtain the correct value of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath33 at the temperature @xmath34 , we need to account for the levels with energies about @xmath35 .",
    "obviously , the error in positions of these levels will introduce corresponding error in the dependence @xmath36 .",
    "its analytical evaluation is difficult , and the comparison of the results of calculations with the experimental data , performed in sec .",
    "[ sectparam ] is the better way to understand the temperature domain of validity of the dimerized model .",
    "as our results show , the dimerized model gives reasonable results for temperatures lower than about 50 k.    recalling that the temperatures below 30 k are of most interest , we conclude that the dimerized model is satisfactory for present needs of experimentalists .",
    "thus , we consider the mn@xmath0 cluster as consisting of four `` small '' dimer spins @xmath18 and four `` large '' spins @xmath37 ( corresponding to the four non - dimerized ions mn@xmath8 ) , coupled by exchange interactions ( see fig .  [ figmn2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we have to account for the anisotropic relativistic interactions in the cluster , so the hamiltonian of the system can be written as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the spin operators of small dimer spins @xmath18 , @xmath40 are spin operators of large spins @xmath37 , and @xmath41 denotes the part of the hamiltonian describing relativistic interactions in the cluster .",
    "summation in ( [ ham ] ) is over pairs of spins coupled by exchange interactions . in the first term of the hamiltonian we took into account that each small dimer spin is coupled with all the other small spins , so @xmath42 up to an insufficient additive constant .",
    "to zeroth order in @xmath17 , the exchange integrals of the dimerized models are connected with the initial exchange parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 as follows : @xmath43 since the values of @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are not known , the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath30 are to be determined from experimental data ( see sec .  [ sectparam ] ) .    furthermore , different types of relativistic anisotropic magnetic interactions possibly present in mn@xmath0 clusters should be included in the hamiltonian .",
    "a large easy - axis anisotropy in the cluster is one of most important features to be taken into account .",
    "generally , this anisotropy arises due to the single - site anisotropy of large spins ( spins of mn@xmath8 ions ) and various kinds of anisotropic exchange .",
    "we performed calculations for three basic types of easy - axis anisotropy in the cluster :    @xmath45    where summations in ( [ b ] ) and ( [ c ] ) are over exchange - coupled pairs of spins .",
    "anisotropy parameters ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 or @xmath48 ) have been chosen to give a correct value of the zero - field splitting between the states @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( 14.4 k ) .",
    "all three types of anisotropy give rather close energies of low - lying excitations ( of energy less than 40 k ) , but higher excitations are reproduced best if the anisotropy is assumed to be of single - site type ( [ a ] ) , so we can conclude that the easy - axis anisotropy is primarily of single - site type .",
    "this result agrees with the conclusion drawn in ref .  .",
    "we will consider only this kind of anisotropy .",
    "another potentially important sort of relativistic interaction is an in - plane anisotropy of large spins , i.e.  @xmath41 can include a contribution of the form : @xmath49,\\ ] ] where the presence of fourth - order symmetry axis in the cluster is directly taken into account .",
    "the small spins @xmath18 are excluded since @xmath50 for pauli matrices @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 ; and only spins of non - dimerized mn@xmath8 ions give a nontrivial contribution .",
    "these ions are surrounded by eight oxygen ions forming a distorted octahedron .",
    "the axes of oxygen octahedra are significantly tilted from the @xmath54-axis of the cluster , therefore , this term can be relatively large , even comparable to the easy - axis anisotropy .",
    "but , surprisingly , our results show that this kind of interaction gives negligible effect , except for trivial renormalization of the easy - axis anisotropy constant @xmath46 in ( [ a ] ) .",
    "if we account for this renormalization , the positions and the wave functions of excited levels remain almost unaffected even for @xmath55 ( i.e. , for the in - plane anisotropy three times larger than the easy - axis one ) .",
    "thus , this kind of interaction can be excluded from further considerations .",
    "another important interaction is dzyaloshinsky - morya ( dm ) antisymmetric exchange . to our knowledge",
    ", the possible presence of dm - interactions in mn@xmath0 was first suggested in ref .  , but little attention has been paid until now .",
    "our results show that these interactions are , indeed , very important and have rather large magnitude .",
    "a pair of ions coupled by dm - interaction is described by the hamiltonian @xmath56,\\ ] ] and the magnitude of the dm - vector @xmath57 can be estimated as @xcite @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the isotropic ( nonrelativistic ) exchange coupling between ions and @xmath60 is the spin - orbit coupling constant ( which is rather small for transition ions ) . for comparison ,",
    "the magnitude of easy - axis anisotropy is estimated as @xmath61 , i.e.  is of next order of smallness in comparison with @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the dm - interactions in mn@xmath0 can be expected to be important .    in the 8-spin model of the cluster",
    "there are dm - interactions of two kinds :    @xmath62\\\\ \\label{dmb } h^1_{\\text{dm}}&=&\\sum_i\\sum_j { \\bf d}_1^{i , j } \\cdot    [ { \\bf s}_i\\times { \\bf s}_j].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    summation in ( [ dma ] ) is over exchange - coupled pairs of spins ; summation in ( [ dmb ] ) is over all pairs of dimer spins , since all dimer spins interact with each other .",
    "we studied both kinds of dm - interaction and found that the second kind , i.e. @xmath63 involving small spins can be neglected .",
    "therefore , we can neglect the interactions of the type ( [ dmb ] ) .    the crystal field in mn@xmath0 , governing the dm - interactions , possesses certain symmetry elements , thus imposing restrictions on the values of @xmath64 .",
    "it is reasonable ( and rather standard @xcite ) to assume that the crystal field is determined mainly by the oxygen octahedra surrounding manganese ions in the cluster ; so the symmetry of the crystal field is governed by the mutual arrangement of the oxygen octahedra .",
    "the following two symmetry elements are of interest for us .",
    "the first one is the fourth - order rotary - reflection axis @xcite parallel to the @xmath54-axis of the cluster .",
    "this symmetry is obviously preserved in the 8-spin model of the cluster , so the two dm - vectors @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( see fig .  [ figmn2 ] )",
    "define all the other @xmath64 .",
    "the other element of symmetry is the mirror plane @xmath67 parallel to the @xmath6-axis passing through the ions @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( see fig .",
    "[ figmn1 ] ) .",
    "the oxygen octahedra surrounding the ions @xmath59 and @xmath68 ( see fig .",
    "[ figmn1 ] ) are invariant with a good degree of accuracy @xcite with respect to reflection in the plane @xmath67 ( inspection of the structure data supplied in refs",
    ". shows this ) ; this symmetry is also preserved in the 8-spin model .",
    "thus , the vector @xmath66 ( fig .",
    "[ figmn2 ] ) defines all the other dm - vectors in the hamiltonian ( [ dma ] ) :    [ dmvec ] @xmath69    obviously , any other vector @xmath64 can be taken as a basis instead of @xmath66 .",
    "no other symmetry elements allow for further reduction , so dm - interactions in mn@xmath0 are described using three parameters : @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "below , these parameters are denoted simply as @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .    as our results show , in the dm - hamiltonian ( [ dma ] ) the terms proportional to @xmath74 produces negligible matrix elements ( a few percent in comparison with other terms ) .",
    "it occurs due to symmetry reasons : the inspection of the relations ( [ dmvec ] ) shows that the components @xmath73 and @xmath75 transform antisymmetrically with respect to reflection in the plane @xmath67 , but the component @xmath74 transforms symmetrically .",
    "the matrix elements of the terms proportional to @xmath74 nearly cancel each other , leading to negligible matrix elements .",
    "therefore , these terms are excluded from consideration and we set @xmath76 with negligible error .    finally , having studied all the interactions described above , we can write down the hamiltonian of the cluster in the following form : @xmath77,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dm - vectors @xmath64 obey the relations ( [ dmvec ] ) with the parameter @xmath78 .",
    "at present , data of various experiments on magnetic molecules mn@xmath0ac are available , including the temperature dependence of the effective magnetic moment of the cluster @xmath79 @xcite , the results of epr experiments @xcite , dynamic susceptibility measurements @xcite , inelastic neutron scattering data @xcite and specific heat data @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , only few of these data can be used for determining the parameters of the 8-spin hamiltonian for mn@xmath0 clusters .",
    "recent high - frequency epr experiments @xcite refined the description of the easy - axis anisotropy of the cluster and showed that the anisotropy hamiltonian in the single - spin model can be approximated as follows : @xmath80 where @xmath5 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 denote the operators of the total spin of the cluster .",
    "it means , in terms of a many - spin approach , that the energies of the low - lying levels with spin @xmath2 obey eq .",
    "( [ hfappr ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the derived values of quartic corrections @xmath83 and @xmath84 are rather large and , as our calculations show ( see below ) , seem to be poorly explained using the single - spin description of mn@xmath0 , i.e.  when accounting only for the states belonging to the @xmath2 manifold .",
    "our results show that the excited levels with @xmath14 are necessary to give reasonable values for the quartic corrections .",
    "another set of results , very useful for elucidating the many - spin interactions in mn@xmath0ac , is the neutron scattering results supplied in ref .  .",
    "the experiments have been performed at very low temperatures ( mostly , 1.5 k to 2.5 k ) , where only the lowest levels @xmath3 are populated .",
    "since the selection rule for neutron scattering is @xmath85 , only the levels with @xmath4 can give rise to scattering peaks ( the levels with @xmath86 have too large energies @xcite and can be excluded ) .",
    "results of these experiments can be summarized as follows .",
    "a prominent peak of spin origin at about 0.3 thz has been detected and attributed to the transitions to the levels with @xmath87 , in excellent agreement with all previous data ( 0.3 thz corresponds to about 14.4 k ) . at higher energies ,",
    "two sets of peaks have been detected around 1.2 thz and 2.0 thz .",
    "the fitting proposed in ref .",
    "gives two peaks in the first set ( at energies about 57 k and 66 k ) and three peaks in the second set ( at energies 90 k , 96 k and 105 k ) ; but authors indicate clearly that possibly more peaks are present ( most likely , three peaks in the first set and four or five in the second )",
    ". another interesting detail of the neutron scattering spectra is a very broad mode situated at about 0.2 thz ; this mode disappears when the temperature is less than about 2 k.    the authors have not managed to interpret these features , except for the peak at 0.3 thz .",
    "they pointed out that there is particular difficulty in interpretation of the peaks at 1.21.3 thz : the model they used for susceptibility fitting gives two degenerate levels @xmath16 at about 33 k , an obvious contradiction with the neutron scattering spectrum .",
    "we show below that the 8-spin model developed here can overcome these difficulties and gives correct positions for neutrons peaks at 1.2 thz along with a correct description of the susceptibility data .",
    "thus , we found the following experimental results to be relevant for the purpose of a quantitative description of the mn@xmath0 clusters .",
    "the distance between the ground state and the first excited level(s ) is 14.4 k. the energies ( the anisotropy splittings ) of the low - lying levels , belonging to the @xmath2 manifold , obey formula ( [ hfappr ] ) .",
    "there are two or three neutron peaks around 6070 k , two of them are situated at 57 k and 66 k. also , there are up to five peaks around 100 k , three of them are at 90 k , 96 k and 105 k. the temperature dependence of the susceptibility ( or , equivalently , the dependence @xmath79 ) has the form displayed in refs .   and fig .",
    "[ figsusc ] .",
    "the other experimental results , though providing important information about mn@xmath0 , are much less suitable for our purposes ( to a large extent , because different , _ a priori _ equally probable , interpretations are possible ) .",
    "having derived the spin hamiltonian for the 8-spin model of mn@xmath0 , we attempted to extract its parameters from the relevant experimental data .",
    "we used the following two - step numerical scheme . at the first step ,",
    "the relativistic term @xmath41 has been neglected resulting in an isotropic exchange hamiltonian .",
    "the eigenstates of this hamiltonian are degenerate with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "thus , it is sufficient to take into account only the states with @xmath88 , so the exchange hamiltonian ( represented by a matrix 1286@xmath891286 ) has been diagonalized within the subspace spanned by these states . then",
    ", at the second step , the relativistic anisotropic interactions have been taken into account . among the states obtained at the first step ( having @xmath88 ) ,",
    "we retain only those with the energy less than @xmath90 ( a sufficiently large value for this parameter has been chosen ) and generate the corresponding states with different @xmath5 ( basis states ) .",
    "then the complete hamiltonian ( [ hamilton ] ) has been diagonalized within the subspace spanned by the generated basis states .",
    "calculations with different values of @xmath90 have been performed to assure that the positions of lower levels are obtained with desired accuracy .",
    "typical values of @xmath90 were about 250 k : the levels with higher energies are not worth including due to the limited accuracy of the 8-model itself ( see sec .",

    "at present , having rather limited number of the relevant experimental data , it is hard to distinguish between the parameter sets a , b and c. the easy - axis anisotropy parameters @xmath112 and @xmath83 are obtained with good precision in epr experiments , but the magnetization measurement data @xcite suggest other values for these parameters ; so , comparison of the experimental values of @xmath112 and @xmath83 with our results can not serve as a definitive basis for judgement . also , the quality of the description of the high - energy neutron peaks can not be decisive , since the disagreement can be attributed to the limited accuracy of the dimerized 8-spin model itself .",
    "megagauss - field experiments @xcite , along with careful measurements of the low - energy peaks ( around 1.2 thz ) and fitting of their amplitudes seems to be a promising strategy for future investigations .",
    "nevertheless , the results already obtained provide new important information about the role of many - spin interactions in mn@xmath0 clusters . in this section",
    "we focus our attention on the qualitative consideration of the results obtained and discuss the interpretation of the experimental data .",
    "first , it is worthwhile to note that the consideration of states with spin @xmath134 less than 10 leads to rather large quartic corrections to the energy of easy - axis anisotropy .",
    "if these excited states are not taken into account , i.e.  if only the states with @xmath2 are included , the value of @xmath83 is of order of 10@xmath135 k.    another",
    "important fact is the large magnitude of the dzyaloshinski - morya ( dm ) interactions in the cluster mn@xmath0 . in our opinion",
    ", this can be attributed to the low symmetry of the cluster .",
    "indeed , the strength of the dm - interaction is governed to a large extent by asymmetry of crystal field acting on the interacting ions @xcite .",
    "an instructive example is provided in ref .",
    ": the dm - interaction can emerge for ions located at the surface of a magnet , even though these interactions are prohibited for ions in the bulk of the magnet . in some sence",
    "the mn@xmath0 molecule possesses `` surface '' everywhere , and the symmetry of the crystal field is rather low .",
    "the presence of the large dzyaloshinsky - morya term in the hamiltonian provides a key to an explanation of the neutron scattering data .",
    "first , the dm - terms lead to the appearance of the two neutron peaks around 1.2 thz .",
    "if these terms are absent , there are two degenerate levels with @xmath109 around 1.2 thz . among all the interactions we considered ( see sec .",
    "[ sectham ] ) , only the dm - interaction can lift this degeneracy and provide a large splitting ( about 9 k ) , as observed in experiments . similarly , according to our calculations , several peaks around 2 thz appear only due to dm - interactions .",
    "the origin of the peak at 0.3 thz has been completely explained in ref .  : it appears because of easy - axis anisotropy splitting the levels with different @xmath5 .",
    "our results agree with this conclusion .",
    "an interesting feature in the neutron scattering data is the broad mode situated at 0.2 thz .",
    "no states of this energy have been observed , e.g. , in epr - experiments @xcite .",
    "our calculations also show no states with the energy 0.2 thz ( or , equivalently , about 10 k ) . in our opinion , this mode is caused by an interaction of mn@xmath0 clusters with the dissipative environment . due to this interaction , each level broadens ( nonuniform broadening ) , forming a quasiband of finite width @xmath136 ( see refs .   for details ) . the value of @xmath137 k can be estimated from the single - crystal hysteresis measurements @xcite .",
    "transitions between the two quasibands take place , so , along with the peak at 0.3 thz ( 14.4 k ) , a broad mode of inter - quasiband transitions appears .",
    "it happens when different states in the quasibands are populated , i.e.   at the temperatures of order of @xmath137 k , which agrees with experiment .",
    "energies of the inter - quasiband transitions are reduced by the value about @xmath138 k , so the corresponding neutron scattering mode is situated around @xmath139 k , or , equivalently , around 0.2 thz , in agreement with experiment . at increasing temperatures , the occupancy of quasibands becomes more uniform , so the intensity of the broad mode increases along with the decrease in intensity of the peak at 14.4 k. this behavior also agrees with experiment .",
    "however , this qualitative explanation can not be considered as sufficient , and a rigorous quantitative treatment is necessary .",
    "such a treatment constitutes a separate physical problem to be investigated in the future .",
    "strong dzyaloshinsky - morya interactions can play an important role in relaxation of magnetization in mn@xmath0 clusters .",
    "the possible importance of dm - interactions for the relaxational properties of mn@xmath0 was already mentioned in ref .  , but no analysis was made .",
    "below , the relation between the dm - interaction and relaxation is analyzed qualitatively .",
    "the relaxation time in mn@xmath0 is very long , about 2 months at 2 k. at relatively high temperatures the magnetization relaxation time @xmath140 follows the arrhenius law @xmath141 with @xmath142 sec and the effective barrier @xmath143 k @xcite . at low temperatures",
    "the situation changes : the experimental results presented in refs .",
    "show that @xmath140 saturates below the crossover temperature @xmath144 k , which is attributed to the onset of `` ground state - to - ground state '' tunneling .",
    "such a high value of the crossover temperature poses certain problems , since at present the nature of magnetic relaxation in mn@xmath0 is unknown .",
    "important information has been supplied by hysteresis measurements @xcite : it has been directly shown that the relaxational mechanism in mn@xmath0 should allow for transitions between the states @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "the relaxation of magnetization has been extensively studied @xcite within the single - spin model of mn@xmath0 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hfappr ] ) of this model provides transitions with @xmath147 only , and an external transversal field @xmath148 is necessary to allow the @xmath149 transitions .",
    "different sources of this field have been considered : a hyperfine field induced by nuclear spins @xcite and a dipole - dipole field induced by other clusters @xcite .",
    "there are certain difficulties facing these interpretations .",
    "e.g. , as reported in refs .",
    ", the relaxation rate increases on dilution of mn@xmath0 in solution , although the dipole - dipole interactions between the clusters decreases ; this seems to be difficult to explain with the relaxation mechanism based on intercluster dipole - dipole interactions @xcite .",
    "the other mechanism , based on the hyperfine fields @xcite can not easily explain the high value of the crossover temperature .",
    "strong dzyaloshinsky - morya interactions constitute another source of magnetic relaxation in mn@xmath0 .",
    "it obviously allows the @xmath149 transitions . on solution ,",
    "the dipole - dipole fluctuating fields between the clusters decrease , thus decreasing the decohering influence of the environment , so the relaxation rate increases .",
    "this agrees with experimental results @xcite .",
    "relatively large magnitude of dm - interactions can , in principle , explain the high value ( 2 k ) of the crossover temperature .",
    "this shows that the quantitative study of dm - based relaxation in mn@xmath0 is important .    nevertheless , we emphasize that , to our knowledge , current information is not sufficient for judgement in favor of some single relaxation mechanism . at present , all of them can be considered as equally probable , and the possibility of a combination of different mechanism exists .",
    "independent of the problem of relaxation in mn@xmath0 , dm - interactions present an interesting and important mechanism for magnetic relaxation .",
    "it can be significant , for example , in nanosized particles , where large dm - interactions can arise due to reduced symmetry at the surface @xcite .",
    "the relaxation based on this interaction is rather unusual : it is related not to the potential barrier created by easy - axis anisotropy , but to the barrier created by isotropic exchange .",
    "the point is that the dzyaloshinsky - morya term @xmath150 couples the states with different values of total spin @xmath134 , i.e.   @xmath151 this feature differs drastically from standard consideration of relaxation in small particles , where only the anisotropy barrier is usually taken into consideration .",
    "isotropic exchange interactions are usually rather strong , but it does not necessarily means that the dm - based relaxation is negligible .",
    "e.g. , in spin - frustrated systems the height of the exchange barrier can be considerably reduced .",
    "moreover , it can be significant in certain non - frustrated systems .",
    "for the relaxation based on dm - interactions , the relaxation time should be governed by the ratio @xmath152 , where @xmath20 is the absolute value of dzyaloshinsky - morya vector and @xmath59 is the exchange integral . on the other hand , for `` conventional '' relaxation mechanism ,",
    "when the anisotropy barrier is overcome , the ratio @xmath153 governs the relaxation rate , where @xmath154 is the anisotropy constant and @xmath155 is the strength of the interaction between the spins and their dissipative environment ( e.g. , spin - phonon coupling constant )",
    ". situations with @xmath156 are not impossible .",
    "therefore , quantitative investigations of relaxation mechanisms based on dm - interactions is of great interest and importance .",
    "in the present work , we have performed an extensive study of spin excitations in mn@xmath0 , explicitly accounting for its many - spin internal structure .",
    "the dimerized 8-spin model of the mn@xmath0 clusters @xcite has been used . along with isotropic exchange coupling , various kinds of anisotropic relativistic interactions",
    "have been studied : anisotropic exchange coupling between the cluster ions , single - site anisotropies of easy - axis and in - plane type , and various kinds of dzyaloshinsky - morya ( dm ) interactions .",
    "surprisingly , most of these interactions play only a minor role .    as a result",
    ", we propose a basic many - spin hamiltonian which includes isotropic exchange couplings , single - site anisotropies of easy - axis type and dm - interactions between the cluster spins .",
    "three possible sets of parameters are determined from the relevant experimental data .",
    "the results of our calculations reproduce satisfactorily various experimental results , such as positions of neutron scattering peaks , high - frequency epr data and the experimental dependence of the magnetic susceptibility on temperature .",
    "in particular , our results suggest rather strong dzyaloshinsky - morya interactions are present in the mn@xmath0 cluster .",
    "we have discussed qualitatively the possible relation of these interactions to the unusual magnetic relaxational properties of mn@xmath0 .",
    "we emphasized that dm - interactions present interesting relaxation mechanisms worth further investigations .",
