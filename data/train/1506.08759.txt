    "we are interested in , the transferred momentum @xmath9 is such that the de broglie wavelength ( @xmath10 ) of the probe is much smaller ( @xmath11 fm ) than the typical radial extension of a high-@xmath6 nucleus ( about 6 - 7  fm for lead ) . for a correct description of the high - angle tails of the scattering angle distribution",
    "it is thus mandatory to precisely take into account the effect of the nuclear charge distribution as well as the contribution of scattering off individual protons .    in sect .",

    "multiple scattering has been an active field of theoretical and experimental efforts since very early days of particle physics .",
    "goudmit - saunderson  @xcite and lewis  @xcite developed a theory which allows to calculate the exact distribution of the angle in space ( @xmath13 ) due to multiple scattering after a given path @xmath14 .",
    "the problem was tackled by formulating it in terms of a transport equation solved by expanding the angular dependence in legendre polinomials ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the angular distribution is found to be given by : @xmath16 with the transport mean free paths defined as : @xmath17 the theory does not assume any particular form of the single scattering differential cross section @xmath18 and provides exact solutions . it can also deal with arbitrary nuclear form factors provided that integrals are evaluated numerically . nevertheless for large scattering angles",
    "the calculation requires the evaluation of high order legendre polinomials which are difficult to treat .",
    "this limitation is also relevant for the present case and hence this approach was not considered further .",
    "another interesting theoretical study was performed in  @xcite by meyer .",
    "the theory by molire  @xcite is there extended to take into account a generic nuclear form factor .",
    "the general distribution of the scattering angle @xmath13 is derived and , for a point - like nucleus , it reads as : @xmath19d\\chi   \\label{eq : eq1}\\ ] ] @xmath20 being equal to @xmath13 apart for numerical constants which depend on the parameters of the problem ( incoming momentum , particle , target thickness , density etc . ) which are made explicit in appendix a. the other quantities are either constants @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 or simple functions of the system parameters as for @xmath24 ( see appendix a for more details ) .",
    "the component having the form @xmath25 results from multiple consecutive scattering in the target thickness while the tail at higher @xmath20 arises from the occurrence of single high angle scattering . for a finite nucleus with a charge density distribution @xmath26 the @xmath27 coefficients in eq .",
    "[ eq : eq1 ] are replaced by other coefficients @xmath28 involving integrals of the form factor @xmath26 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "if we approximate the charge density of the nucleus as a uniform sphere the resulting form factor takes this form : @xmath29 \\label{eq : eq3}\\ ] ] as a further simplification we can approximate @xmath26 with a gaussian function @xmath30 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath28 can then be expressed analitically as simple functions of @xmath6 , @xmath31 and the nuclear radius ( appendix a ) .",
    "unfortunately also this method faces numerical limitations that we will discuss in sect .",
    "[ sec : g4theo ] .",
    "it will anyway be used for small scattering angles as a validation for the monte carlo approach which we are about to describe in sect .",
    "[ sec : mcsim ] .",
    "multiple coulomb scattering can be simulated numerically using different approaches :    * _ detailed simulations _ : each track is simulated at microscopic level as a succession of connected straight segments ( free - flights ) , changes of direction are determined by sampling the polar deflection @xmath32 from the single scattering distribution , and the azimuthal scattering angle uniformly in [ 0 , 2@xmath33 .",
    "the length @xmath34 of the free - flight is sampled from the exponential distribution @xmath35 .",
    "the simulated angular and spatial displacements are `` exact '' , i.e. they coincide with those obtained from a rigorous solution of the problem ( i.e. by mean of the transport equation introduced in the theories of goudsmit - saudersons  @xcite and lewis  @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless detailed simulations are in practice not possible computationally except for specific cases involving very low energies and thicknesses . * _ condensed simulations _ :",
    "the global effects of the collisions during a macroscopic step are simulated using approximations .",
    "usually the theories of goudsmit - saundersons  @xcite , molire  @xcite and lewis  @xcite are used to predict the angular and spatial distributions after each step . at energies where condensed algorithms are required ,",
    "the great majority of elastic collisions are `` soft '' collisions with very small deflections . especially the spatial distributions might present significant dependencies on the choice of the macroscopic step which has to be carefully studied . * _ mixed algorithms _ : hard collisions , with scattering angle @xmath13 larger than a given value @xmath36 , are individually simulated and soft collisions ( with @xmath37 ) are described by means of a multiple scattering approach .",
    "it is clear that , by selecting a conveniently large value for the cutoff angle @xmath36 , the number of hard collisions per electron track can be made small enough to allow their detailed simulation .",
    "the value of the mean free path between the simulation of hard collisions , @xmath38 , is given by @xmath39 .",
    "as the fluctuations in the spatial displacement after a certain path length are mainly due to hard collisions , a mixed procedure ( with a suitably small value of @xmath36 ) yields spatial and angular distributions that are more accurate than those from a condensed simulation .",
    "since we are interested in rare high-@xmath9 events a mixed algorithm approach has been preferred . furthermore in this scheme",
    "the inclusion of nuclear effects can be easily taken into account when sampling the angular distribution at single - scattering level .",
    "the version of geant4 used for this study is 4.9.6.p02 with the ` standardss ` physics list option to enable the treatment of single scattering above a certain angular threshold .",
    "the simulation of single - scattering is dealt with by the routine ` g4wentzelokandvixsection.cc ` .",

    "[ fig : steps ] for 2  gev / c muons on 1  mm thick lead target .",
    "the slope of the exponential distribution corresponds to a value of @xmath40 m such that the single - scattering code is invoked on average about 7000 times for each muon crossing the 1 mm thick lead target .",
    "the event sampling is done according to the model by wentzel  @xcite in the formulation of  @xcite .",
    "the model adopts a modified coulomb potential to take into account the effect of the screening of the electron cloud : @xmath41 .",
    "a slightly modified version of the molire screening angle @xmath42 is used whose @xmath6 and energy dependence is parametrised as ( cfr .",

    "if we define @xmath46 the differential cross section @xmath47 in presence of screening is proportional to @xmath48 .",
    "the inverse transform method leads to the following sampling formula : @xmath49 with @xmath50 . in the multi - gev regime",
    "the screening parameter @xmath51 is found to be of @xmath52 and hence the sampled distribution effectively reduces to a rutherford law @xmath53 .",
    "the single scattering angular distribution generated from eq.[eq : sampling ] is then corrected for effects related to the atomic electrons , the nuclear recoil and the nuclear charge density by introducing a function @xmath54 . a random number @xmath55",
    "is thrown between 0 and 1 and the scattering is discarded if @xmath56 . the atomic correction reads @xmath57 while the recoil correction follows the term found in the mott scattering formula @xmath58 .    in the standard implementation nuclear charge effects",
    "are implemented through a dipole form factor with @xmath59 in mev .",
    "the nuclear extension is parametrised as @xmath60 giving @xmath61  fm for the @xmath62pb nucleus .",
    "dipole form factors arise from an exponentially decreasing nuclear charge density and are thus not appropriate to describe the charge distribution of large nuclei .",
    "we have then modified the simulation program by introducing an ad  hoc form factor for lead based on the saxon - woods parametrisation of the charge density which is known to produce a much more realistic description : @xmath63 the saxon - woods form factor has been fitted on precise electron scattering data available in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we have used @xmath64 fm and as in  @xcite .",
    "the dipole form factor predicts a largely overestimated contribution of high-@xmath9 scatterings due to the assumption of a charge density being much more concentrated with respect to what is actually observed .",
    "it is hence only appropriate for small @xmath9 .",
    "the form factor @xmath65 has been then extracted numerically by taking the squared fourier transformation of the charge density @xmath66 .",
