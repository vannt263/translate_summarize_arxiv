    "the  emission observed adjacent to ( @xmath32 , @xmath16 ) most likely arises from portions of the circum - nuclear ring beyond their map .",
    "at 2.2 @xmath24 m , the emission from the galactic center is attenuated by interstellar material in the foreground ( `` foreground extinction '' , mostly 4 - 8 kpc from the galactic center ) and by material in the galactic center itself ( `` galactic center extinction '' ) .",
    "catchpole et al . ( 1990 ) mapped the extinction toward the galactic center by observing the near - ir reddening of giant stars in the central few hundred parsecs .",
    "along our h@xmath3 strip at b= 005 ( for 06@xmath33 + 06 ) , the extinction is fairly uniform with a value a@xmath342.5 mag .",
    "although most of this extinction is in the foreground , some of it could occur within the galactic center since catchpole et al .",
    "( 1990 ) were able to identify patches in their maps with a@xmath352.5 with known molecular clouds in the galactic center ( see plate 4 in glass et al .",
    "1987 ) . based on this work , we adopt a@xmath36=2.5 for the foreground extinction .",
    "the galactic center extinction greatly exceeds the foreground extinction .",
    "typical @xmath37co j=1@xmath380 linestrengths along the strip we have surveyed in h@xmath3 are 1500 kkms@xmath39 ( oort 1977 ) .",
    "this line strength implies an a@xmath36 of 1040 mag , depending on the co / h@xmath3 and a@xmath36/h@xmath3 ratios in the galactic center ( sodroski et al .",
    "the extinction through individual clouds may also be substantial ( a@xmath341030 for a 10 pc long cloud with n@xmath40=10@xmath41 @xmath42 ) .",
    "the relevance of the galactic center extinction depends on the source of the h@xmath3 emission .",
    "any h@xmath3 emission originating within the clouds will be highly extincted .",
    "if the h@xmath3 emission arises on the cloud surfaces , however , we only miss the h@xmath3 flux from the back side of each cloud .",
    "clouds lying in front of other clouds will further reduce the flux reaching us from the front surfaces . if , in the galactic center , the velocity integrated area filling factor of clouds , _",
    "f _ , is substantially greater than unity , extinction by overlapping clouds will reduce the h@xmath3 flux observed from the front surfaces by a factor @xmath43 in addition to the foreground extinction and to the loss of emission on the opposite sides of the clouds . typical clouds in the galactic center disk have kinetic temperatures @xmath670 k and linewidths @xmath620 km s@xmath39 ( gsten 1989 ) . an ensemble of such clouds could produce the observed @xmath37co j=1@xmath380 lines in the galactic center with f@xmath61 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the extinction of any h@xmath3 emission from cloud surfaces facing the sun beyond the foreground extinction of a@xmath36= 2.5 discussed above is not substantial .",
    "since the extinction of emission from within the clouds or from the sides facing away from us is difficult to estimate and since no correction is usally made for such effects in giant molecular clouds and galactic nuclei , we make no additional extinction corrections here .",
    "if one ignores the region immediately around @xmath15 , the de - reddened ( @xmath1  mag , see section  [ sec : extinction ] )  surface brightness along the galactic plane has a roughly constant value of @xmath44 .",
    "any excitation mechanism for the  must be able to explain both the absolute intensity and the uniformity and extent of the emission .",
    "the excitation of the  @xmath45 , @xmath46 state can result either from radiative decay from uv - excited electronic states or from energetic collisions .  can absorb 91123 nm photons in the @xmath47 lyman and @xmath48 werner bands .",
    "about 90% of the time , the excited  decays to some ro - vibrational level of the ground electronic state .",
    "the relative line intensities arising in uv - excited are insensitive to density or to uv field strength if @xmath49  ( black and van dishoeck 1987 ) . at densities @xmath50",
    ", uv - excited gas can become hot enough that collisions populate states with @xmath45 ( sternberg and dalgarno 1989 ) .",
    "collisional excitation can also result from shocks which abruptly heat the gas to @xmath51  k ( e.g. hollenbach , chernoff , & mckee 1989 ) .",
    "several observational results lead us to believe that uv excitation can explain the  emission in the galactic center .",
    "the denser parts of clouds like orion and ngc 2024 produce  emission with an intensity close to that observed in the galactic center . in orion and ngc 2024",
    ", the degree - scale h@xmath3 emission has a typical surface brightness @xmath52  ( luhman et al . 1994 ) . along the molecular ridges in these clouds ,",
    "the h@xmath3 surface brightness is 3 - 5 times higher .",
    "observations of  transitions arising from higher - lying states indicates that , in these sources , the  emission is a result of uv fluorescence .",
    "if large - scale  emission arises in the surface layers of the clouds where uv photons can excite the molecules , the dust , which absorbs the bulk of the incident flux , ought to radiate in the far - ir continuum as well .",
    "luhman & jaffe ( 1996 ) have compared the  observations of clouds in the galactic disk with iras far - ir continuum results and derived a relation between the  line and far - ir continuum intensities .",
    "we can use this relationship and the measured far - ir intensities in the galactic center to see if uv - excitation is plausible for our observed  emission . in most of the region along our galactic center h@xmath3 cut , the iras 100 @xmath24 m band detectors were saturated . in order to compare the galactic center h@xmath3 data to far - ir continuum measurements with comparable angular resolution ,",
    "we have combined the un - saturated iras measurements from the outer ends of our h@xmath3 strip with the 40250 @xmath24 m continuum measurements of odenwald and fazio ( 1984 ) . to make the two data sets comparable , we have first converted the iras 60 @xmath24 m and 100 @xmath24 m fluxes into a total far - ir flux ( the fir parameter of fullmer and lonsdale 1989 ) .",
    "the iras total far - ir flux agrees well with the far - ir flux derived by odenwald and fazio in the regions where their data and the unsaturated iras data overlap .",
    "we then converted the combined datasets into integrated far - ir intensity for comparison with our h@xmath3 strip .",
    "we used the luhman & jaffe galactic disk dataset to re - derive their h@xmath3/far - ir relation in intensity units .",
    "we obtain , @xmath53 where both intensities are in .",
    "the dispersion of the galactic disk cloud  intensities about this relation is log(@xmath54 ) = 0.23 .",
    "if we de - redden the galactic center h@xmath3 observations by  = 2.5  mag ( _ but otherwise do nothing to fit the data to the galactic disk relation _ ) , the galactic center intensities have a dispersion log(@xmath54 ) = 0.26 about this relation .",
    "the galactic center results are therefore completely consistent with the empirical far - ir vs.  relationship derived for the uv - excited surfaces of clouds in the galactic disk .",
    "we can also compare the h@xmath3 line intensities predicted by models of photon - dominated regions to the observed intensities .",
    "the models use indirect observations of the far - uv field in the galactic center ( radio and far - ir continuum fluxes ) as inputs .",
    "for the radio , we predict the far - uv field using emission from extended , low - density ( eld )  regions because the molecular cloud column densities , and therefore the extinction at the wavelength of , tend to be high ( and uncertain ) toward the discrete  regions . away from discrete h",

    "@xmath57  k as the uv source , the 2.3@xmath5810@xmath59 lyman continuum photons imply @xmath62.3@xmath5810@xmath59 photons in the range which can excite the  ( 91 - 123 nm ) , or a luminosity of @xmath60  ( black & van dishoeck 1987 ) . from our observations ,",
    "the average  flux in a 33 beam is @xmath61  .",
    "the corresponding total  luminosity in the 8.2  pc ( 33 ) region is @xmath62  , if we correct for an extinction of @xmath1  mag and use the pdr model of black & van dishoeck ( 1987 ) to extrapolate to the  cooling in all lines ( @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 ) .",
    "the ratio of the near - ir  luminosity to the luminosity in the far - uv band that is effective in exciting  is 0.028 , which is close to the value of 0.034 from an appropriate pdr model for the galactic center ( model 19 in black & van dishoeck 1987 , which has n@xmath66 = 10@xmath41 and a uv field i@xmath67 = 10@xmath68 ) .",
    "the far - ir continuum intensities along our galactic center strip are typically 0.8  ( odenwald and fazio 1984 ) .",
    "if all of this emission arises from a single molecular cloud surface filling the beam , it corresponds to a far - uv flux @xmath69 times the mean interstellar radiation field in the solar neighborhood ( draine 1978 ) .",
    "given the likely number of clouds along each line of sight and various geometric effects , the likely far - uv field is @xmath70 times the solar neighborhood value .",
    "for this range of uv field strengths and densities between 3@xmath5810@xmath68 and 3@xmath5810@xmath41 , black and van dishoeck ( 1987 ) predict  line intensities in the range @xmath71 , bracketing our typical observed , de - reddened value .",

    "such thermal line ratios can also occur , however , in uv - excited gas if the uv fields and densities are sufficiently high ( sternberg and dalgarno 1989 ; luhman et al .",
    "since the typical hydrogen density in the circum - nuclear disk is large , i.e. , @xmath75 , and the uv field is intense in the central 3  pc , ( the number of total lyman continuum photons absorbed by the gas is @xmath76 , lacy et al .",
    "1980 ) , the strength and character of the  emission from the circumnuclear disk are also consistent with uv - excitation .",
    "shock excitation of the  transition must take place , at some level , in the inner 400 pc of the galaxy .",
    "a large variety of dynamical activity may give rise to shocks with appropriate characteristics .",
    "outflows around newly formed stars and shocks caused by supernova remnants impinging on molecular clouds in the galactic disk both produce  emission and should be observable in the galactic center .",
    "bally et al ( 1987 ; 1988 ) surveyed the galactic center region in the @xmath37co and  @xmath77 , and cs @xmath78 lines .",
    "the gas distribution is highly asymmetric about the center , and some negative velocity gas is seen at positive longitudes , which is `` forbidden '' to gas in circular orbits .",
    "this gas and other clouds with eccentric orbits may collide with material in more circular orbits .",

    "( 1994 ) suggested that a dense ( @xmath79 ) , @xmath80 `` clump '' has collided with the extended less dense `` shell '' of the cloud complex producing a @xmath81 shock .",
    "finally , the internal velocity dispersion of the molecular clouds is in the range of @xmath82 ( bally et al .",
    "if the internal collisions efficiently dissipate the relative kinetic energy by radiative cooling following shocks , there should be  emission throughout the molecular clouds , much of it , however , heavily extincted .",
    "depending on the context , shock - excited  emission could result either from dissociative j - shocks ( colliding clouds , supernova remnants ) , or from c - shocks ( outflows , dissipation of turbulence ) .",
    "the j - shocks give rise to  intensities in the range of 3@xmath5810@xmath83 ",

    "for a@xmath36 = 2.5  mag , the predicted intensity matches what we observe in the galactic center fairly well . in order to explain the distribution of observed  emission",
    ", however , the number of shock fronts times the area covered per beam must roughly equal the beam area along virtually every line of sight through the inner 400 pc of the galaxy , an unlikely picture at best .",
    "c - shocks can produce  intensities in the range of those observe in the galactic center . a single c - shock with n = 10@xmath41 @xmath42 and v = 20 km s@xmath39 gives i@xmath90 @xmath91 3@xmath5810@xmath83  ( draine , roberge , & dalgarno 1983 ) . the emergent intensity , however , is extremely sensitive to the shock velocity , varying ( at n@xmath66 = 10@xmath41 @xmath42 ) by 3 orders of magnitude from v@xmath92 = 18 to v@xmath92 = 40  . a model making use of c - shocks to produce the observed uniform  distribution would have to be somewhat contrived .",
    "while there may be some shock - excited  emission from the galactic center , it is difficult to argue away the expected pdr emission and then construct a reasonably simple shock model capable of explaining the observations .",
    "a reliable test of the excitation mechanism would be to observe transitions arising higher above ground than the  line .      to estimate the total  luminosity of the galactic center",
