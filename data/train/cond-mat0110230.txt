    "to answer basic questions with simple models is the favorite topic in the work of bob dorfman .",
    "this contribution , dedicated to him on the occasion of his 65th anniversary , concerns the force relaxation in a model for granular media .",
    "the model is certainly simple but whether the question we answer is a basic one , we leave to his judgment .",
    "the first idealization of granular media is to consider them as a pack of equally sized beads .",
    "the second idealization is to put the beads on a regular lattice , with periodic boundary conditions horizontally in order to avoid boundary effects .",
    "the problem is the propagation of the force exerted on the top layer downwards to the deep lower layers of the bead pack .",
    "now it might seem that all randomness , characteristic for granular media , has been lost in this idealization .",
    "however the forces which the beads exert on each other are supposed to be transmitted in a random way .",
    "let @xmath3 be the force in the downward direction on the @xmath4th bead in a layer .",
    "this bead makes contact with a number of @xmath5 beads in the layer below , which we indicate by the indices @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath7 s are displacement vectors in the lower layer as shown in fig .",
    "[ qmd ] ( a ) for a 2dimensional triangular packing and in ( b ) for a 3dimensional fcc packing .",
    "bead @xmath4 transmits a fraction @xmath8 of the force @xmath3 to the bead @xmath6 underneath it .",
    "the random element in the model is that the fractions @xmath8 are taken stochastically from a uniform distribution satisfying the constraint @xmath9 this is the q  model as introduced by liu et al . @xcite .",
    "the problem we consider is : given the force distribution @xmath10 in the top layer , what is the force distribution in the lower layers and in particular how does the distribution approach its asymptotic value ?",
    "recent studies @xcite addressed the relaxation of the second moments for general @xmath11 distributions on a triangular lattice . restricting ourselves to the uniform @xmath11 distribution",
    ", we investigate the relaxation of the full distribution for arbitrary lattices .    in order to write the equation for the force distribution we consider the force @xmath12 on the @xmath13th bead in layer .",
    "it is composed of forces @xmath14 from the layer on top of it as @xmath15 we have left out the so - called injection term representing the weight of the particles . as a consequence of the regularity of the lattice ,",
    "a bead is supported by @xmath5 beads in the next layer and reciprocally a bead in the lower layer also has @xmath5 beads pressing on it .",
    "note that , due to the fluctuations in the @xmath11 s , the sum over the @xmath16 in ( [ a2 ] ) does not add up to 1 , which means that even a set of equal @xmath14 will lead to fluctuations in the @xmath12 .",
    "the transformation of the force distribution from one layer to the next layer can be written as @xmath17 where we have introduced a vector notation for the forces in one layer @xmath18 , and for the integrations we use the abbreviations @xmath19 as one sees from the integration over the @xmath8 , we have taken a uniform and normalized distribution over these stochastic variables .",
    "the restriction to a uniform @xmath11distribution simplifies the mathematics while it still reproduces important experimental observations @xcite .",
    "the recursive relation ( [ a3 ] ) between two successive layers contains the problem of force relaxation from top to bottom of the bead pack . for a number of properties it is more convenient to work with the laplace transform of the distribution",
    ", @xmath20 the laplace transform of ( [ a3 ] ) leads to @xmath21 the sum in the exponent can be rewritten as @xmath22 by changing the summation variable @xmath13 to @xmath23 .",
    "so we can express the right hand side of ( [ a6 ] ) also in the laplace transform and we get @xmath24 with @xmath25 the projection of the full distribution @xmath26 to the single ",
    "site force distribution @xmath27 is particularly simple in the laplace language @xmath28 since @xmath29 means a full integration over @xmath30 .",
    "either ( [ a3 ] ) or ( [ a8 ] ) completely defines the propagation of the forces for boundary conditions @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the number of sites in a layer and @xmath33 the number of layers , ( both assumed to be large ) . for the ultimate asymptotic behavior one has @xmath34 , but the @xmath35 case is physically more relevant and therefore the main focus of this paper .",
    "it is also not sensitive to the ( periodic ) boundary conditions that we have chosen .",
    "coppersmith et al .",
    "@xcite derived a stationary state of ( [ a3 ] ) , @xmath36 it is a product state without any correlation between sites .",
    "they provided numerical evidence that it is indeed the asymptotic force distribution .",
    "this paper concerns the decay towards the stationary state , which turns out to be algebraic rather than exponential , as is implicit in @xcite .",
    "we will show how `` diffusion of correlations '' accounts for this slow relaxation .",
    "furthermore , we will pay attention to the question of which initial distributions evolve to the stationary state ( [ a10 ] ) and in what sense the approach has to be understood .    the first part of this paper deals with the decay of the distribution on the level of its moments .",
    "we start out by showing that the distribution of the total force in a layer is invariant under the recursion .",
    "then we illustrate the propagation of forces in the system by considering the evolution of the first few moments of the force distribution . in the second part of this paper",
    "we construct solutions of the recursion relations , which dominate the asymptotic decay towards the stationary state ( [ a10 ] ) , with an emphasis on the relaxation of the single  site force distribution . in the concluding",
    "remarks we comment on the results that we have obtained and discuss which of these can be generalized to arbitrary @xmath11 distributions .",
    "there is one obvious invariant in the problem : the total force on the particles of one layer @xmath37 this can be seen by summing ( [ a2 ] ) over all @xmath13 @xmath38 by again changing the summation variable @xmath13 to @xmath39 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath40 is irrelevant for the problem since , due to the linearity of the force law ( [ a2 ] ) , an overall scaling of the forces is possible without changing the physics of the problem .",
    "thus we could fix the value of @xmath40 and only consider distributions having strictly this value , but that is mathematically not very convenient .",
    "the distribution of the total force is obtained from the distribution of the forces as @xmath41 since relation ( [ x2 ] ) holds for any set of @xmath11 s , one finds from ( [ a3 ] ) that @xmath42 is invariant .",
    "so the initial distribution @xmath43 dictates that of the asymptotic state .",
    "this seems a strong restriction on the relaxation of the distribution function , but in practice it is rather a warning on what quantities to inspect . as an example consider the total force distribution of the stationary state ( [ a10 ] ) , which reads @xmath44 it is a sharp distribution with a mean and variance @xmath45 note that fixing the total force @xmath40 excludes ( [ a10 ] ) as the stationary state ! the distribution ( [ x6 ] ) is very reminiscent of the energy distribution in the canonical ensemble .",
    "indeed this analogy , also mentioned in @xcite , is illuminating . for large @xmath32 the total force distribution ( [ x6 ] )",
    "is narrow , in the same way as the total energy distribution in the canonical ensemble .",
    "now it is well known that the correlation functions of the canonical ensemble and the micro ",
    "canonical ensemble ( in which the energy is fixed ) , coincide for all distances ( to order @xmath46 ) . but",
    "integrals over the correlation functions over all distances differ in the two ensembles .",
    "a similar subtlety arises here .",
    "as long as we consider spatial correlations between forces , the distribution of the total force is unimportant , if it is sharp in the sense of ( [ x7 ] ) .",
    "however , for sums over the correlations , differences will appear .",
    "consider for instance the force correlations between two sites , defined as @xmath47 summing @xmath48 over @xmath4 and @xmath49 yields @xmath50 if @xmath40 is allowed to fluctuate , this sum clearly differs from the result obtained for fixed values of @xmath40 .",
    "the fluctuations which we allow in the total force are limited to @xmath51 with @xmath52 of order 1 .",
    "then they are unimportant in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "forces applied to one bead in the top layer will diffuse into a wider region in the lower layers . to see this ,",
    "consider the first moments @xmath53 of the distribution for an inhomogeneous initial distribution .",
    "the relaxation of these moments is given by @xmath54 integrals over the @xmath55 s are elementary , but this one is trivial as each @xmath56 gives the same answer , and with ( [ a1 ] ) it must be equal to @xmath57 .",
    "so the result becomes @xmath58 this simple recursion law tells us that a distribution with only a non  vanishing moment on one site in the top layer gradually spreads over the lower layers like a diffusion process .    in order to understand the role of system size it is useful to inspect the fourier",
    "transform @xmath59 which relaxes from layer to layer as @xmath60 with the transmission function @xmath61    in accordance with the conservation of the total force we see that the mode @xmath62 is conserved as @xmath63 .",
    "all the other modes decay exponentially since @xmath64 .",
    "so we find asymptotically @xmath65 with @xmath66 the average of the ( initial ) total force .",
    "translating it back to space yields @xmath67 i.e. all sites feel the same average force regardless of the initial distribution .",
    "clearly this result holds in the limit @xmath34 . in the other limit @xmath35",
    "we may replace the summation over @xmath68 by an integration over the brillouin zone ( bz ) of the layer and one gets the standard diffusion process from the integral @xmath69.\\ ] ] in the limit of large @xmath33 the integral can be evaluated by the saddle point method , using the fact that the dominant contribution comes from small @xmath68 .",
    "this allows us to approximate @xmath70 by @xmath71 \\simeq \\log [ \\,1 - \\sum_\\alpha ( { \\bf k \\cdot r}_\\alpha)^2/2\\ , ] \\simeq -d\\ , k^2,\\ ] ] which renders the integration effectively a gaussian . the diffusion constant @xmath72 depends on the latttice structure of the layer , with @xmath73 for the triangular packing and @xmath74 for the fcc packing .",
    "thus one sees that the ratio of @xmath75 decides whether we should take a discrete sum over the @xmath68 variables ( @xmath34 ) or whether we should integrate over the brillouin zone ( @xmath76 . in the first case , only @xmath62 matters and we have diffusion crossing the periodic boundary conditions in the layer . in second case",
    ", a region around @xmath77 has an influence and there are no effects from the finite size of the layer",
    ".    having seen the washing out of spatial inhomogeneities by diffusion , we now concentrate on translational invariant initial conditions and on the case @xmath35 .",
    "as we are free to put @xmath78 , the relaxational properties show up only in the higher moments of the force distribution .",
    "we therefore examine how these moments evolve under the recursion .",
    "the transformation of second moments @xmath79 is obtained by combining ( [ new1 ] ) and ( [ a3 ] ) as @xmath80 the @xmath11-integrals can be worked out and yield @xmath81 inserting this into ( [ z2 ] ) gives the following recursion scheme @xmath82 the function @xmath83 incorporates all corrections due to the kronecker @xmath84 s in ( [ z3 ] ) and the only non  zero terms are @xmath85 the index @xmath86 denotes a nearest neighbor position .",
    "it is easily checked that the difference of two unequal displacement vectors @xmath7 and @xmath87 points to a nearest neigbor position .",
    "it is a matter of counting to verify that correlations of the type @xmath88 are fixed points of relation ( [ z4 ] ) for arbitrary @xmath89 .",
    "this conclusion was also derived by lewandowska et al .",
    "@xcite for the specific case of a 2-dimensional triangular lattice and @xmath90 , ( corresponding to ( [ a10 ] ) ) . for @xmath91 one has long  ranged correlations since , for large @xmath49 , the average of the product does not approach the product of the averages ( set equal to 1 ) .",
    "@xmath89 is related to the scale of the forces as one sees from ( [ new2 ] ) .",
    "this relation implies for ( [ z6 ] ) @xmath92 for a sharp distribution of the total force in the sense of ( [ x7 ] ) and normalization of the average @xmath93 , there is little room for @xmath89 to differ from 1 , allowing only deviations of order @xmath46 .",
    "so we take @xmath90 corresponding to the stationary state ( [ a10 ] ) and come back to the issue in the appendix .    to study the relaxation in more detail we consider the difference with respect to values of the stationary distribution @xmath94 which will of course relax according to the same relation ( [ z4 ] ) .",
    "as an example , the flow diagram for the @xmath95 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ flow ] for the triangular lattice .",
    "=    the advantage of taking the difference is that its fourier transform is well behaved for distributions which have only short range correlations , since both the initial correlation function and the stationary values approach 1 for large distances @xmath49 .",
    "the fourier transforms are defined as @xmath96 and @xmath97 transforms as @xmath98 the correction function @xmath99 can be written as @xmath100.\\ ] ] note that @xmath101 is invariant , which implies @xmath102 as it should be according to relation ( [ new2 ] ) .",
    "the recursion ( [ z9 ] ) can be solved by introducing the generating function @xmath103 where the sum extends over all layers @xmath2 .",
    "multiplying ( [ z9 ] ) by @xmath104 and summing over @xmath2 gives an algebraic equation for the generating function @xmath105,\\ ] ] where the auxiliary function @xmath106 is defined as @xmath107 @xmath106 is our prime interest as it contains the center coefficients @xmath108 , giving information about the relaxation of the single ",
    "site force distribution .",
    "the other @xmath109 contain correlations between two sites . using ( [ z10 ] ) , we write the solution of ( [ z13 ] ) as @xmath110 the first term",
    "will be shown to give purely diffusive behaviour .",
    "this can be understood from the recursion of ( [ z4 ] ) : without the corrections @xmath83 , it becomes a regular random walk in a layer of dimension @xmath111 .",
    "the second term , which originates from the @xmath83 , contains a correction to the asymptotic amplitude and a term ( proportional to @xmath112 ) representing a transient .",
    "hence , we anticipate diffusive relaxation @xmath113 .    using eq .",
    "( [ z8 ] ) , the function @xmath106 satisfies @xmath114 inserting expression ( [ z15 ] ) into ( [ z16 ] ) gives a closed equation for @xmath106 .    as we shall see , the large @xmath2 behaviour is dominated by the behavior at small @xmath68 .",
    "we have assumed the initial correlation to be short  ranged such that @xmath115 is a regular function of @xmath68 at the origin .",
    "therefore we may as well continue by considering first the _ uncorrelated _ initial distributions .",
    "then only the value @xmath116 gives a contribution and we have initially @xmath117 as depicted in fig .",
    "@xmath118 sets the overal amplitude of the relaxation process .    before discussing the asymptotics of the general case we begin by giving the results for the triangular packing with @xmath119 . in this case",
    "all the integrals can be carried out explicitly by writing them as contour integrals in the complex @xmath120 plane . for ( [ z16 ] ) and ( [ z15 ] ) we get @xmath121 this relation for @xmath106",
    "can readily be solved as @xmath122 we have made the expansion in powers of @xmath123 because each higher term leads to a weaker singularity and therefore to a faster decay .",
    "tracing back these features to the form ( [ z15 ] ) , we indeed see that the first term is responsible for the leading singularity , that the second modifies the amplitude by a factor 3/2 and that the third leads to higher powers and thus to transient behavior .",
    "the leading singularity gives an expansion @xmath124 note that these are precisely the binomial coefficients one expects from the random walk described by the first term in ( [ z4 ] ) .",
    "using stirlings formula for the factorials yields as the leading term for the @xmath125 @xmath126    so we see that the singularity at @xmath127 contains the asymptotic behaviour .",
    "this is also true for the general case . defining the integral @xmath128 we get for @xmath129 @xmath130.\\ ] ]",
    "we again have not written the solution in closed form in order to see the origin of the terms .",
    "the first term contains the diffusive singularity at @xmath127 .",
    "this follows from the integral for @xmath131 which develops a singular denominator for @xmath127 at the point @xmath62 .",
    "the type of singularity depends on the dimension @xmath111 of the @xmath68 integral and thus on the dimension of the system .",
    "the singularity can be obtained by the saddle point method using the approximation ( [ y15 ] ) for @xmath70 and reads @xmath132 , where the power 0 means a logarithm ( for the fcc packing ) . consequently the decay is as @xmath1 for large @xmath2 .",
    "the other terms in ( [ z23 ] ) give a modification of the amplitude by a factor @xmath133 and a faster decay term ( due to a weaker singularity ) .",
    "in setting ( [ z17 ] ) we have made the restriction to initial states in which the second moments of the forces are uncorrelated . from the analysis it is clear that for the asymptotics it is a justified substitution for any initial state with short  ranged correlations .",
    "thus the conclusion of this section is that for arbitrary initial distributions with short  ranged initial correlations the second moment of the force correlations relax towards the stationary distribution ( [ a10 ] ) . to be more precise",
    ", the approach is not perfect in view of the restriction ( [ z11 ] ) .",
    "the values of all @xmath108 saturate at a level @xmath134 when @xmath2 starts to exceed the value @xmath135 .",
    "then the diffusion of the initial deviation goes around the periodic boundary conditions and the system will approach a state ( [ z6 ] ) with @xmath136 of the order @xmath46 .",
    "this is the subtlety to which we alluded in section [ total ] .",
    "the total sum over the @xmath95 corresponds to @xmath137 and when @xmath138 is not perfectly equal to @xmath139 , the system will never fully relax to @xmath140 .",
    "coppersmith et al . @xcite have determined a stationary state of eq .",
    "( [ a8 ] ) , which is special in the sense that it is a product of single  site distributions . since the proof of the stationary distribution is vital for the decay of deviations , we briefly repeat its construction .",
    "it is based on the following identity which holds for uniform @xmath11 distributions @xcite @xmath141 now if we apply this identity to the ( normalised ) distribution @xmath142 we see that each @xmath5th power of the factor splits up into @xmath5 single powers of the neighboring sites .",
    "the product over all sites in a layer then restores the @xmath5th power of the denominator , which makes @xmath143 an invariant . putting the mean force equal to 1 requires that @xmath144 .",
    "so we have a stationary distribution @xmath145 translating this back to the force distribution we get ( [ a10 ] ) .",
    "further information is deduced by differentiation of the identity ( [ b1 ] ) with respect to @xmath146 giving @xmath147 this allows us to construct another invariant @xmath148 inserting this expression into the recursion relation ( [ a8 ] ) , we encounter the integral ( [ b1 ] ) for all sites , except for site @xmath4 where we have to perform the integral of the left hand side of ( [ b4 ] ) . that produces for a set of surrounding sites factors with the power @xmath149 and the numerics is such that adding them together yields again a sum as in ( [ b5 ] ) .",
    "it is not surprising that this additional invariant exists since we showed that ( [ b2 ] ) was invariant for arbitrary @xmath146 or scale of the forces .",
    "thus the invariance of ( [ b5 ] ) is nothing else than expressing this scale invariance of the recursion .",
    "in fact ( [ b5 ] ) follows directly from differentiating ( [ b2 ] ) with respect to @xmath146 .",
    "it is tempting and indeed rewarding to continue to differentiate the identity ( [ b1 ] ) .",
    "differentiation of ( [ b4 ] ) with respect to @xmath146 yields @xmath150 now the distribution @xmath151 is not invariant since the right hand side of ( [ b6 ] ) produces terms with powers @xmath149 of the denominator on two sites .",
    "we will show in next sections that ( [ b7 ] ) leads to the `` slowest mode '' decaying towards to the stationary state .",
    "the fact that the distribution ( [ b2 ] ) is stationary for arbitrary values of @xmath152 leads to a multitude of other stationary distributions by differentiation of ( [ b2 ] ) with respect to @xmath152 .",
    "the distribution ( [ b5 ] ) is an example . in the appendix we comment on the relevance of these stationary states . from this section",
    "the main message is :    * in the transformation from layer to layer , the total power of the factors remains the same .",
    "this implies that we can select classes of perturbations which transform into themselves . *",
    "the sum of the coefficients of the terms is invariant under the transformation .",
    "let us now investigate how a deviation from @xmath153 will decay under recursion .",
    "we take an initial distribution of the type @xmath154.\\ ] ] in the spirit of the previous section we consider deviations of the form @xmath155 where the @xmath156 are products of two factors .",
    "@xmath157    it is clear from the previous section that a @xmath158 of the form ( [ g5 ] ) is after the transformation again a sum over the @xmath159 @xmath160 the transformed coefficients @xmath161 are expressed in terms of the @xmath95 of the previous layer , using the formulae of the previous section , as @xmath162 on purpose we have chosen the same notation for the coefficients in the representation ( [ g5 ] ) and in section [ corr ] for the correlations in the forces .",
    "as one sees from comparing ( [ g7 ] ) with ( [ z7 ] ) and ( [ z4 ] ) the coefficients in both cases obey exactly the same recursion relation .",
    "this means that we can take over the conclusions of section [ corr ] .",
    "the first one is that we can construct a stationary state of the form @xmath163 the nature of this stationary state , having long  ranged correlations , will be discussed in the appendix .",
    "the other relevant conclusion concerns the case where only @xmath164 .",
    "this is a minimal disturbance of the stationary state with only a modification of the single  site probability distribution and no correlations between sites .",
    "this is precisely the same initial condition as for the case of the second moment starting with an uncorrelated initial state .",
    "thus the development of this deviation ( [ g5 ] ) is exactly the same as that of the second moment of an arbitrary deviation from the stationary state .",
    "the difference is that we now have the development of the full force distribution . projecting this joint distribution onto a single - site distribution , by putting all @xmath165 except for one",
    ", one finds @xmath166 so on the level of the single  site distribution the shape of the deviation remains invariant , but the amplitude decays as @xmath167 .",
    "this means that not only the second moment , but the whole single ",
    "site distribution relaxes towards the stationary state ( [ a10 ] ) with a characteristic shape of the single  site distribution given by ( [ new5 ] ) .",
    "in this section we show that higher moments lead to slower modes .",
    "let us start by looking at the third moment of the forces .",
    "the linearity of the force relation ( [ a2 ] ) guarantees that the third moments transform as a closed set @xmath168 the @xmath11 integral is complicated but elementary , with several exceptional cases due the equality of the lower indices .",
    "the general trend is however clear .",
    "one gets a relation of the form @xmath169 the correction terms refer to the cases where the indices @xmath170 and @xmath171 are either equal or nearest neighbors .",
    "consider now the class of uncorrelated distributions which coincide with the stationary state ( [ a10 ] ) up to the second moment but start to deviate at the level of the third moment .",
    "the difference of the third order correlations with respect to the stationary state then only has a value for @xmath172 .",
    "such a disturbance gradually spreads over the @xmath173 dimensional space of the indices @xmath49 and @xmath174 .",
    "the decay rate is therefore as @xmath175 which is faster than the @xmath1 of the slowest mode .",
    "the correction terms in ( [ h2 ] ) mildly modify the spreading of the correlations described by the first term on the right hand side of ( [ h2 ] ) .",
    "they do no change the power of the decay but change the amplitude in front of the power .",
    "the same story holds for the construction of the higher modes . by further differentiation of relation ( [ b6 ] ) one derives the transformation law of the functions which have 3 factors of the type @xmath176 extra over the stationary state .",
    "such functions do not modify the normalisation , the mean force and the second moment and therefore couple to the decay of the third moment as we have described above . on the level of the single ",
    "site distribution the mode takes the form @xmath177,\\ ] ] with the @xmath178 .",
    "the generalization to higher moments and faster modes is evident . on the level of the single site distribution",
    "it simply means a change of the power of the last factor in ( [ h3 ] ) .",
    "the coefficient in front of a power @xmath174 decays as @xmath179 .",
    "the question that emerges is : can one observe these modes in the relaxation of an actual simulation ?",
    "this question is related to the problem of whether an arbitrary initial distribution can be decomposed as a superposition of these modes .",
    "already on the level of the single site distribution one observes that our modes do not form a complete set in the mathematical sense .",
    "all modes start with a power @xmath180 in the force distribution ; hence the modes form a poor basis for the small @xmath181 behavior .",
    "nevertheless , the modes that we have constructed do describe the asymptotic decay .",
    "we should realize that before the asymptotic regime sets in , a fast process takes place .",
    "if we start out with a distribution with a finite probability density for small forces , this probability will be supressed rapidly in the region of small forces by the recursion relation , due to the available phase space . for a small resultant force @xmath12 to occur , all the components @xmath16 have to be small .",
    "already after one recursion step , a finite probability density ( in the single  site distribution ) will be replaced by a probability density starting as @xmath182 ( modulo logarithmic factors , which move to higher orders in the next recursion steps ) .",
    "thus after a few steps , the decay of the probability distribution can be well described by the above constructed modes .    in order to test the mode picture",
    "we have performed numerical simulations on a 2dimensional triangular lattice and a 3dimensional fcc lattice .",
    "we took the initial condition @xmath183 for each site @xmath4 , which also means @xmath184 .",
    "this initial distribution is a substantial deviation from the stationary state ( [ a10 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ mds ] we have compared the observed single ",
    "site distributions with the analytical results . in the first figure",
    ", we show the single  site force distribution of the @xmath185th layer in the triangular packing , after subtracting @xmath186 .",
    "the analytical curve is the slowest mode ( [ new5 ] ) , whose amplitude has been computed from the recursive scheme ( [ g7 ] ) , with the initial value @xmath187 , corresponding to the initial second moment @xmath184 . as the comparison does not involve any free parameters the correspondence is remarkable ;",
    "the more so since the deviations bear the signature of the next slowest mode ( [ h3 ] ) . in the second figure ,",
    "the simulation data is shown for the fcc packing with the same initial distribution and @xmath188 . in line with the fact that the modes decay faster in a higher dimension ,",
    "the agreement is even more impressive .",
    "we have calculated the decay towards the stationary state ( [ a10 ] ) of initial force distributions which have short  ranged force correlations and a sufficiently sharp distribution of the total force ( [ vn1 ] ) . since we can fix the average force",
    ", the relaxation occurs for the second and higher order force correlations .",
    "the short  ranged correlations become longer ranged while their amplitudes diminish in a diffusion process in correlation space .",
    "this accounts for the slow algebraic relaxation of the second moments of the force .",
    "these moments also dictate the slowest modes of relaxation of the full distribution function . for arbitrary initial conditions",
    "we find the asymptotic form ( [ new5 ] ) for the relaxation of the single  site distribution .",
    "we have focussed on the triangular and the fcc packing as examples , but the results can be easily extended to other packings and other connections between layers .",

    "the stationary state ( [ a10 ] ) is not the only stationary state as can already be seen from the fact that each initial distribution of the total force stays invariant . if we exclude , however , long  ranged correlations in the initial state and restrict ourselves to sharp distributions of the total force in the sense of ( [ vn1 ] ) , the stationary state can only marginally differ from ( [ a10 ] ) as is explained in the appendix .",
    "it is not remarkable that the product stationary state ( [ a10 ] ) results also from a mean  field approximation .",
    "however , it is interesting that the single  site distributions ( [ new5 ] ) etc",

    "yet it would be misleading to conclude that the mean  field approximation is accurate .",
    "the mean  field modes decay exponentially as a consequence of ignoring correlations in the system . an initially uncorrelated state develops correlations which get longer in range and smaller in amplitude .",
    "the long persistence of these correlations explains why the mean  field approximation does not accurately describe the relaxation .    in our calculations",

    "the slow approach to the stationary state is a robust property which holds for arbitrary @xmath11 distributions .",

    "@xcite have found a countable set of @xmath11 distributions for which the stationary state is uncorrelated , on the basis of a generalization of ( [ b1 ] ) .",
    "for these distributions the construction of the modes is completely similar to what we have done for the uniform distribution . in general",
    ", the asymptotic distribution will exhibit correlations , albeit in higher moments than the second .",
    "the question how the correlations in the asymptotic state are related to the properties of the @xmath11 distribution remains intriguing , even if the correlations are of higher order and likely to be small in magnitude .",
