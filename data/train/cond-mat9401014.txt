    "an interesting property of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( ybco ) is that one may replace yttrium with almost any rare earth and still obtain a high - t@xmath5 superconductor,@xcite isostructural with ybco .",
    "however , there are two rare earths that do not form a high - t@xmath5 superconductor when attempts are made to substitute them onto the y site : cerium and praseodymium.@xcite attempts to substitute with ce have not produced the ybco structure , even in small concentrations .",
    "praseodymium , however , substitutes readily onto the y site , with t@xmath5 dropping monotonically with pr concentration .",
    "therefore , prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( pbco ) is a unique material in that it has the ybco structure , with a rare earth instead of y , yet is not superconducting .",
    "in contrast , substitution by gd , for example , has essentially no change in t@xmath5 or in the crystal structure.@xcite there has been a large effort to explain this reduction in t@xmath5 as a new avenue in the search to explain why ybco is superconducting in the first place .",
    "pbco is interesting in its own right , however , as an insulating layer between layers of ybco in multilayer films , or as a well matched substrate for epitaxial films of ybco .",
    "there are many related explanations for the decrease in t@xmath5 in y@xmath3pr@xmath4ba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( ybco : pr ) , mostly involving the localization of holes through valence change or magnetic pair breaking mechanisms .",
    "the earliest arguments note that ce , pr and tb are the only rare earths that can exist in either a + 3 or + 4 valent state.@xcite since y only exists in a + 3 valent state , one explanation for the decrease in t@xmath5 with pr concentration is that some fraction of the pr exists in its formal + 4 state , filling a hole state in the cu - o planes and localizing it onto the pr site .",
    "there is some experimental evidence to support this view , notably the measured magnetic susceptibility of 2.7 @xmath12 per pr ion in pbco,@xcite which may be compared to the pr@xmath9 ion ( 3.58 @xmath12 ) and the pr@xmath10 ion ( 2.54 @xmath12 ) .",
    "however , this result should be considered in light of some model systems that give moments significantly different than the ionic moments , such as the moment of bapro@xmath1 ( 0.7 @xmath12),@xcite where pr@xmath10 is presumably the natural state .    another possible mechanism for suppressing t@xmath5 in this material",
    "utilizes the fact that , except for ce , the pr@xmath9 ion is the largest of all the rare earth + 3 ions .",
    "the 4_f_@xmath13 electrons are far enough extended to hybridize with the o 2_p _ electrons , and thus interfere with the conduction band.@xcite in fact , crystal field measurements can be reconciled with pr in a completely + 3 state,@xcite with broad transitions that can be attributed to hybridization between the cu 5_d_-o 2_p _ states and the pr 4_f _",
    "states.@xcite    x - ray absorption near - edge structure studies ( xanes ) also indicate that pr is primarily trivalent .",
    "comparisons of the pr l@xmath14-edge of pbco to that for pro@xmath0 and pr@xmath0o@xmath1 indicate a valence close to + 3,@xcite or slightly above it.@xcite the latter studies suggest that a small amount of pr + 4 is present ; horn _ et al . _",
    "@xcite give a mean valence of + 3.1 , while lytle _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite find that the valence decreases from + 3.45 for ybco : pr 20% to + 3.25 for ybco : pr 60% with all of the pr@xmath10 on the cu(2 ) site ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for structural notation ) .",
    "m - edge studies @xcite and electron - energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) studies @xcite also find that the pr valence is close to + 3 .",
    "these same studies show that the number of holes in the cuo@xmath0 planes does not change with pr concentration , while normal - state hall effect measurements @xcite show a decrease in the number of mobile charge carriers with x , indicating that the holes are being localized rather than filled .",
    "photoemission experiments also find that the pr valence is close to + 3 and that there is significant hybridization of the pr 4_f _ states with other valence states.@xcite in addition , thin films of y@xmath15tb@xmath15ba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 have recently been produced , with a t@xmath5 of 92 k.@xcite such a high t@xmath5 for a 50% terbium sample brings into question the argument that the suppression of t@xmath5 arises solely because two valence states can exist .    a theory which combines many of these ideas , proposed by fehrenbacher and rice,@xcite shows that three electronic configurations are favored : a pr@xmath9(4_f_@xmath13)-o state , a pr@xmath10(4_f_@xmath16)-o state , and a pr@xmath9(4_f_@xmath13@xmath17)-o , where the pr@xmath9(4_f_@xmath18 ) indicates that the hole does not reside within the praseodymium s electronic structure ; rather , the hole is in the ligand . the low - energy ligand hole is obtained via a superposition of o 2_p_@xmath19 orbitals with _ f _ symmetry .",
    "the most energetically favorable configuration has pr@xmath9 60 - 70% of the time , with the remaining pr - o bonds split between the other two configurations .",
    "they reason that such a mixture would be consistent with all the above measurements , since ionic pr@xmath10 would only exist 15 - 20% of the time , even though formally the pr is in a + 4 state 30 - 40% of the time .",
    "there is also some structural evidence from neutron and x - ray diffraction for a mixed pr valency .",
    "diffraction results show that pbco is isostructural with ybco .",
    "the diffraction result for the average pr - o nearest - neighbor distance of 2.45  @xcite is reasonably consistent with pr@xmath9-o bond lengths in other pr oxides , such as in bixbyite pr@xmath0o@xmath1 , which has a range of pr - o bond lengths from 2.33  to 2.66 .@xcite it has been noted , however , that both the cu - o plane separation @xcite and the pr - o(2 ) and cu(2)-o(3 ) bond lengths@xcite are more consistent with a valence in the range of + 3.3 - 3.4 , as determined by interpolating trends in these bond lengths with rare - earth ionic radius .",
    "however , this interpolation argument has at least two possible flaws .",
    "first , just because the trend with ionic radius is no longer linear for pr does not necessarily mean pr is in a mixed valence state .",
    "the pr@xmath9 ion is the largest ion anyone has been able to place between the cu - o planes in this structure , so new forces , including more oxygens bonding to the pr than , say ,",
    "y , may be coming into play .",
    "in addition , there are several compounds that show a wide range of pr@xmath9 bond lengths , such as bixbyite pr@xmath0o@xmath1 . secondly",
    ", if three pr - o states exist , as suggested by fehrenbacher and rice,@xcite then one would expect to see two , and perhaps three , different pr - o bond lengths ; pr@xmath10-o bonds range in length from 2.18  in bapro@xmath1 to 2.32  in pro@xmath0 .",
    "therefore the three pr - o states should have bond lengths made up of a long pr@xmath9(4_f_@xmath13)-o , a short pr@xmath10(4_f_@xmath16)-o , and a pr@xmath9(4_f_@xmath13l)-o ( formally , pr@xmath10-o ) , whose bond length should be closer to pr@xmath10(4_f_@xmath16)-o .",
    "diffraction would not be sensitive to such a distribution .",
    "it will either see the dominant bond length ( perhaps the pr@xmath9(4_f_@xmath13)-o ) , or an average bond length consistent with a mixed valency , depending on the degree of disorder .",
    "likewise , trends in the local o environment around the pr with pr concentration are only obtainable with large pr concentrations .",
    "if trends exist in the concentration region where ybco : pr is still superconducting , that is , pr concentrations @xmath20 55% , diffraction may not see them . therefore diffraction results do not rule out disorder and/or distortions of the o around the pr . a distortion in the pr local structure",
    "could indicate the presence of some formal or ionic pr@xmath10 , but other disorder may also exist .",
    "for instance , there is experimental evidence from x - ray diffraction to show that the cu(2)-o(4 ) distance is anomalously short,@xcite and therefore may impede charge transfer between the planes and the chains .",
    "the length of this bond is consistent with the trend with ionic radius of pr@xmath9,@xcite but it is still the shortest cu(2)-o(4 ) bond measured in the ybco - type materials .",
    "any of these results could produce some localization of charge carriers .",
    "since local distortions and/or disorder in the oxygen environment around praseodymium may indicate the presence of some pr with a formal valence of 4 + , we have conducted x - ray absorption fine structure ( xafs ) experiments on several concentrations of y@xmath3pr@xmath4ba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 , at the cu , y , and pr k - edges ( e@xmath21 9 kev , 17 kev , and 42 kev , respectively ) .",
    "( a preliminary version of this work has recently appeared in the literature.@xcite ) xafs is ideally suited to this problem , because it can give us precise information about the local structure around the absorbing atom , including average bond distances and harmonic broadening factors .",
    "in particular , we should be able to determine exactly which site the pr is occupying and observe changes in the xafs compared to ybco . by taking data at three different absorption edges",
    ", we can further constrain our results for the cuo@xmath0 planes and get more information regarding the o(4 ) site .    in sec . [",

    "all the samples were prepared by the same procedure as described in ref . .",
    "stoichiometric amounts of cuo , baco@xmath1 , y@xmath0o@xmath1 , and pr@xmath22o@xmath23 were mixed , ground , and heated at 920@xmath24c in air for 20 hours .",
    "they were then reground , pressed into pellets , calcined at 940@xmath24c in an oxygen atmosphere , and slowly cooled at 60@xmath24c / h to room temperature .",
    "all the y@xmath3pr@xmath4ba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath25 samples were characterized by x - ray diffraction using cu k@xmath26 radiation .",
    "the patterns indicate that all the samples with x @xmath27 0.6 are essentially single phase .",
    "the 100% pr sample may have small amounts of phase impurities , but they are too small to be seen in the xafs ( see sec .",
    "[ fits ] ) .",
    "oxygen content was analyzed by an improved gaseous volumetric technique and found to be within the range of 6.95@xmath280.02 for all samples .",
    "in all the compounds t@xmath5 was determined by a standard four - probe method .",
    "superconducting phase purity was checked using an ac mutual inductance bridge .",
    "only one step was observed for all superconducting samples .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows t@xmath5 as a function of pr concentration and table [ table1 ] gives the lattice parameters and the oxygen content measurements for these samples .",
    "xafs scans were performed on the 0 , 30 , 50 , and 100% pr samples at about 80 k for the pr k - edge and about 50 k for the cu and y k - edges . to prepare the samples for these transmission experiments , we reground the pellets and sifted the powder through a 30 @xmath29 m filter onto pieces of scotch tape .",
    "the tape was then cut and stacked into multiple layers to obtain samples of thickness , t , such that @xmath29 t @xmath30 at the absorption edge , where @xmath29 is the absorption coefficient .",
    "all xafs experiments were performed at ssrl on beamlines 7 - 3 and 10 - 2 . measurements of the incident and transmitted intensities were made with gas - ionization chambers .",
    "si ( 111 ) monochromator crystals were used for the cu and y k - edge experiments , while si ( 400 ) crystals were required for the pr k - edge .",
    "y , pr , and cu k - edge data for @xmath31(k ) = ( @xmath29 - @xmath32)/@xmath32 show xafs oscillations beyond 16 @xmath33 for all k - edges .",

    "the photoelectron wave vector k is given by k= @xmath35 , where e@xmath36 is the k - edge threshold energy .",
    "this procedure was modified somewhat for the pr k - edge data , as detailed in part b of this section .    the most striking difference between the y and the pr k - edge xafs in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is the overall drop in amplitude of the pr k - edge xafs , particularly in the low k part of the spectrum .",
    "the amplitudes of the high - k xafs are similar .",
    "the cu k - edge xafs are comparable to data we have previously obtained on ybco",
    ".    the fourier transform ( ft ) of the data yields peaks in r - space corresponding to different radial distances from the excited atom .",
    "the peaks in the ft of k@xmath31(k ) are shifted in distance due to phase shifts at the scattering and absorbing atoms , and must be compared to standard compound xafs to obtain the bond lengths . in the figures showing ft data , the shifted position of the peaks",
    "are given by vertical lines . in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a and [ fig3]b , the ft of k@xmath31(k ) for data collected on pbco at the pr k - edge and for ceo@xmath0 at the ce k - edge are compared .",
    "ft s for several concentrations of pr in ybco : pr for the y , pr , and cu k - edges are presented in fig . [ fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] , and [ fig6 ] .    by comparing the ft of the xafs from the various edges , we can quickly ascertain the dominant substitution site for pr . from the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ( pbco , pr k - edge ) and the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( ybco , y k - edge ) we can see by the location of the first two peaks that the oxygen ( first peak ) and copper ( second peak ) environment around pr in pbco is very similar to that around y in ybco .",
    "in contrast , a simulation using feff5 @xcite of the ba k - edge xafs in ybco puts the oxygen and copper peaks at very different positions than observed in the pr k - edge data .",
    "similarly , the cu k - edge data for ybco ( fig . [ fig6 ] ) also has a very different environment .",
    "this indicates that most of the pr substitutes at the y site .",
    "we can also compare the pr k - edge xafs for the first pr - o peak to the ce k - edge xafs for the first ce - o peak in ceo@xmath0 .",
    "both sites should be 8-fold coordinated , and since ce and pr are neighbors in the periodic table , their xafs amplitudes and phases should be comparable .",
    "however , the ft of k@xmath31(k ) shows a 60% drop in amplitude in the pr - o peak in the 100% pr sample when compared to the ce - o peak ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the pr - o peak amplitude decreases with increasing concentration ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the pr - cu peak in pbco shows little change with concentration , suggesting that the praseodymium is occupying a well ordered site in the unit cell while the oxygen is not .",
    "changes in the oxygen environment around the yttrium in the y k - edge xafs , if any , are below the resolution of the experiment ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "changes in the further neighbor peaks are only evident in the y - ba , y - y , y - pr regime where the double hump at 3.6  becomes less lopsided toward the lower side with increasing pr concentration .",
    "there is no visible changes in the y - cu peak .",
    "the cu k - edge xafs of pbco show a 10% reduction in the oxygen peak amplitude compared to ybco indicating that some disorder in the oxygen environment exists ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "changes in the cu - ba , cu - y , cu - pr multi - peak",
    "( between 2.6  and 3.4  ) are complicated , with the large peak at 3.15  breaking into two humps at 3.0  and 3.3  .",
    "the peak due to the [ cu(1)-cu(2)]@xmath37 and the ab plane cu - cu bonds ( centered at about 3.65  ) decreases monotonically with pr concentration .",
    "this multi - peak includes the forward scattering due to the co - linear or nearly co - linear oxygens along most of these copper - copper paths .",
    "since the forward scattering amplitude is strongly dependent on small deviations from co - linearity , the changes in this peak probably indicate small displacements of the o atoms .",
    "a preliminary ft of the pr k - edge data which uses a simple spline or polynomial for @xmath32 indicates an anomalous hump near 1  . by fitting the data above 6",
    "@xmath33 to the pr - o and pr - cu peaks , and then subtracting the extrapolated fit from the original data , clear features in @xmath32(e ) emerge which can not be reconciled as an xafs signal ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the position of the feature roughly 115 ev above the absorption edge is consistent with a multielectron excitation , as estimated from the z+1 model , i.e. , with the n@xmath38 transition of nd . as pointed out by holland _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite a ramsauer - townsend - like effect can also lead to significant structure in the atomic background absorption .",
    "such background features arise when the wavelength of the photoelectron is comparable to the dimension of an `` embedded '' absorbing atom in a solid and are essentially an xafs of atomic origin .",
    "the effect appears to be larger in atoms of higher atomic number .",
    "calculations by j. rehr ( private communication ) show that this structure can occur at energies comparable to those of possible multielectron excitations .",
    "the background structure for pr k - edge data is indeed much larger than features we have seen in previous work.@xcite we have removed the background structure using the iterative procedure discussed in ref . .",
    "similar features were removed from the ce k - edge data for the standard compound ceo@xmath0 .",
    "our work on these background features will be the subject of a future paper .",
    "all fits to the xafs data are carried out in r - space on the ft of k@xmath31(k ) .",
    "we typically choose an appropriate range in k for the transform , and only fit it in some desired range in r. in the r - space fitting procedure , we vary the xafs from standard compounds in amplitude , a debye - waller - like broadening @xmath39 , position , and the k - edge threshold energy e@xmath36 to obtain a good fit . we have developed experimental standards for many pairs of atoms . for pairs which we have no experimental standards , the theoretical standards calculated by feff5@xcite were used .",
    "fits to the pr k - edge data used the theoretical standards , while cu k - edge data were fit with experimental standards . since we did not obtain standard compounds containing pr , we evaluated the quality of the theoretical standards for pr by comparing the ce - o standard generated by feff5 to experimental data obtained from ceo@xmath0 , with good agreement for the ce - o peak ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) .",
    "the non - linear fitting routine minimizes a fit parameter , c@xmath13 = @xmath40 @xmath41ft(k@xmath31(k ) ) - fit@xmath42ft(k@xmath31(k))@xmath43 , which is roughly proportional to the statistical @xmath44 .",
    "each fit can include some constraints , such as setting the number of neighbors in one peak equal to some fraction of the number of neighbors in another peak .",
    "such constraints are necessary to restrict the number of independent parameters@xcite and can be used to test a model , or to control correlations between fit parameters .",
    "for instance , correlations between amplitude and broadening factors can be controlled by , say , constraining the sum of the number of neighbors for two peaks to be some fixed value .",
    "the constraints are generally self - consistent , i.e. , various atomic pair distances and number of neighbors are related and must have the same results for measurements at different k - edges .",
    "a fit to feff5 theoretical xafs standards that includes a mix of pr at the y site and at the ba site indicates that , at most , the pr exists on the ba site 8% of the time .",
    "this non - zero result could only be obtained if the fit allowed the energy of the pr k - edge ( e@xmath36 ) to be significantly different ( 10 ev ) for pr in the y site and pr in the ba site .",
    "such a small concentration of pr at the ba site in these fits is consistent with all pr substituting onto the y site .",
    "more information regarding this issue from the other k - edges is difficult to obtain , because the backscattering amplitudes of both the pr ( z=59 ) and ba ( z=56 ) atoms are very similar .",
    "a similar fit that allows some pr to reside on the cu(2 ) site is not as simple to interpret . for this discussion",
    ", we will refer to pr at the cu(2 ) site as pr@xmath45 , and pr at the y site as pr@xmath46 .",
    "we can obtain a fit to the pr k - edge data that includes 20% of the pr residing on the cu(2 ) site , with a lengthening of the pr@xmath45-o bonds by 0.25  and of the pr@xmath45-pr@xmath46 bonds by 0.13  .",
    "such a distortion in the oxygen environment is consistent with both the pr k - edge and the cu k - edge data .",
    "however , a distortion in the pr@xmath45-pr@xmath46 bond should effect how the pr@xmath46 sits in the unit cell , and should thus be reflected in the pr@xmath46-cu bond .",
    "this effect should be large even for small ( @xmath6 20% ) pr@xmath45 concentrations , because the shift in the pr@xmath45-pr@xmath46 bond length is large enough to cause nearly a complete cancellation of the distorted pr@xmath46-cu peaks .",
    "the data ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) and the fits ( see sec .",
    "[ levelpr ] ) show very little change in the pr - cu peak",
    ". therefore , these data are not consistent with pr at the cu(2 ) site within the amplitude limits of xafs spectra ( @xmath6 10% ) , for all pr concentrations measured",
    ".      fits to the y k - edge data were performed , without any constraints , on the 0 , 30 , and 50% pr samples .",
    "results for the oxygen and copper peaks are in table [ table2 ] . further peaks , such as the y - ba , y - pr , and the y - y peak were fit but are not reported , because they are all at similar distances , and the y - ba , y - pr peaks are almost exactly out of phase with the y - y peak .",
    "this situation allows changes in amplitude to be mimicked by changes in position , and thus does not give reliable results .    the number of oxygen neighbors shown in table [ table2 ] changes very little with concentration ( about 5% up to 50% pr ) , while the copper peak shows a slight increase .",
    "such small changes are not within the resolution of this experiment , and the data are therefore consistent with no change in the number of o atoms surrounding y. the y - o distance remains constant .",
    "the y - cu distance does increase monotonically with pr concentration , as one would expect from the diffraction results ( table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "fits to the pr k - edge xafs spectra were performed with and without a variety of constraining models and initial conditions .",
    "each model has an associated c@xmath13 value for its fit , which should give the reader a feel for the range of models that may give plausible results .",
    "table [ table3 ] gives fits to the 100% pr sample with a variety of constraints imposed on the fits that simulate different models .",
    "none of the models constrain the pr - cu peak , and none of the fits to these models show any significant differences in this peak .",
    "model 1 assumes a single pr - o bond , with no constraints , and gives a good quality of fit .",
    "this fit shows an oxygen deficiency around pr , with only 4.8 of the expected 8 oxygens . since this result is inconsistent with the fit results of the y k - edge ( sec .",
    "[ levely ] ) , the cu k - edge ( sec .",
    "[ fits , levelcu ] ) and the volumetric measurements of the oxygen concentration in these samples ( table [ table1 ] ) , we constrained the next fit to give 8 oxygens .",
    "model 2 , which has one pr - o distance and does not allow for an oxygen deficiency , yields a poor fit with a substantially larger @xmath39 and an increase in the goodness - of - fit parameter ( c@xmath13 ) by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "it is therefore highly unlikely that simple harmonic disorder of the pr - o bond can explain the reduction in the pr - o peak in the ft of k@xmath31(k ) .",
    "next we considered several models that allow the first peak to be composed of two different pr - o harmonic distributions . since for k - edge data any shift due to differences in valence should be small , all of these models constrain any e@xmath36 shifts in the pr - o bonds to be the same .",
    "model 3 allows for a double pr - o bond , with no further constraints .",
    "this fit has the best c@xmath13 of any of the models .",
    "it indicates a total number of oxygens which is still low ( 5.7 ) .",
    "a fit to model 4 , which constrains the total number of nearest - neighbor oxygens to sum to 8 , gives an c@xmath13 which is only 30% higher .",
    "two other models were tested to see if the fits in models 3 and 4 can be distinguished from similar models .",
    "all these fits have a good quality of fit parameter , but shift certain parameters outside a reasonable range . a fit which constrains the length of the two bonds to be equal and the total number of oxygens to be 8 ( model 5 ) , but allows for different @xmath39 s gives a very large @xmath39 of 0.287  for the short pr - o bond , with 3.5 o neighbors ( roughly 36% of the o ) . however , a peak this broad has a tiny xafs amplitude , and therefore this fit is essentially the same as the single pr - o peak fit in model 1 .",
    "consequently we do not consider this possibility further .",
    "constraining the @xmath39 s to be equal ( rather than the bond lengths ) , with 8 total oxygen neighbors ( model 6 ) gives a fit with a short pr - o bond length of 2.15  and an increase in c@xmath13 by less than a factor of two over model 4 . in this fit ,",
    "only 15% of the pr - o bonds are short .",
    "such a short bond length is not unreasonable , given that the short pr - o bond in bapro@xmath1 is 2.18 ,@xcite although pr is only 6-fold coordinated with respect to oxygen in that compound .",
    "models 3 , 4 , and 6 all indicate that the radial distribution of pr - o bond lengths is not a symmetric distribution ; the major weight is near 2.45  but there is clearly some weight in a broad peak centered near 2.27@xmath8  .",
    "fits that allow for three pr - o distributions ( as suggested by ref . )",
    "are not conclusive , because the number of parameters required for such a fit exceeds the maximum number of parameters allowed by our fitting range.@xcite however , the two peak fits described above giving large @xmath39 s for the shorter pr - o distribution may mimic a situation with three distances .",
    "the peaks that allow for two pr - o distributions give the most consistent results .",
    "therefore , fits that allow the pr - o peak to be composed of two different harmonic distributions ( models 3 through 6 ) suggest 15 - 40% of the nearest - neighbor pr - o bonds are either disordered and/or shifted ( @xmath47 0.18  ) compared to a more populated , ordered site .",
    "table [ table4 ] summarizes the results of a two - peak fit with the constraint that there be 8 oxygens in the first peak for all measured pr concentrations .",
    "debye - waller factors for the disordered site increase linearly with pr concentration , and are as much as 150% higher than for the `` normal '' site in pbco .",
    "the fits show no appreciable change in the cu environment around praseodymium with concentration , apart from the expected lengthening of the pr - cu bond due to the slight expansion of the lattice ( table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the number of copper neighbors around the praseodymium remains the same for the 100% pr sample compared to the other pr concentration samples .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the effect of the small fraction of other phases in the pbco sample @xcite on the xafs is below the resolution of the experiment .",
    "cu k - edge fits to the 0% and 100% pr samples were also carried out . fits to partial concentrations of pr are difficult to obtain because of the known distortions caused by the two sub - lattices .",
    "several constraints were placed on the fits to maintain certain symmetries in the system .",
    "for instance , the cu(1)-o(4 ) distance plus the cu(2)-o(4 ) distance is constrained to equal the cu(1)-cu(2 ) distance obtained from diffraction.@xcite the ba position is constrained to be in the center of the ab - plane of the unit cell , while the y or pr position is constrained to be in the middle of all planes in the unit cell , consistent with the cu(2)-y and the cu(2)-cu(2 ) ( c - axis ) bond lengths .",
    "other constraints on the number of neighbors have been imposed to maintain the number of atoms at certain sites while still allowing for overall shifts in amplitude .",
    "the proximity of the cu(1)-o(1 ) , cu(2)-o(2 ) , and cu(2)-o(3 ) peaks makes an accurate determination of their relative amplitudes difficult .",
    "consequently , measurements of changes in their relative amplitudes is beyond the resolution of our fits .",
    "we have treated the cu(1)-o(1 ) , cu(2)-o(2 ) , and the cu(2)-o(3 ) as one peak ( the cu - o@xmath48 peak ) , and constrained the relative amplitudes of this peak to the cu(1)-o(4 ) and the cu(2)-o(4 ) peaks .",
    "the fits to the cu k - edge data are summarized in table [ table5 ] .",
    "fit parameters for ybco are typical of fits we have obtained in previous work .",
    "there are several differences between the ybco and the pbco results .",
    "bond length changes are , of course , expected , and will be dealt with in some detail in the next section .",
    "number of neighbor values are 15% different for the combined ba and pr peak compared to ybco , which is usually considered to be outside the expected error ( 10% ) for xafs amplitudes .",
    "however , the amplitude of this combined peak is very sensitive to the individual positions of the ba and the pr , as well as to the position of the cu(2)-cu(2)@xmath37 peak , and are therefore not very reliable .",
    "the broadening factors are slightly larger for the planar oxygens and the cu(1)-o(4 ) bond in pbco , as are the @xmath39 s for the ba and pr peaks .",
    "the cu(2)-o(4 ) bond in pbco is much narrower than in the ybco .",
    "again , the @xmath39 s for the ba and pr peak suffer from the same problems as their amplitudes , but the change in @xmath39 for the oxygen peaks is probably real .",
    "since each absorption edge gives us information about the oxygen environment within ybco : pr , we can constrain our results to give a consistent picture .",
    "y k - edge data show little if any change in the structure of ybco : pr up to 50% pr , except ( possibly ) in the expected lengthening of the y - cu bond .",
    "even this expansion of the y - cu distance is at the edge of the accuracy of this experiment .",
    "these data therefore show that up to 50% pr , the oxygen and copper environment around yttrium in ybco : pr is essentially the same as in pure ybco .",
    "more specifically , there is little evidence of a loss of oxygens or of disorder in the oxygen or copper environment .",
    "the pr k - edge data and fit results indicate that either there are missing oxygens in the cu - o planes or that there is a large amount of disorder and/or distortion in these planes .",
    "the former is inconsistent both with the measured oxygen content and with the number of neighbors for the cu - o and the y - o peaks in the xafs data , and is therefore ruled out .",
    "the data is best fit by two pr - o distributions , separated in pure pbco by about 0.18  , with one distribution less populated and more disordered than the other .",
    "the cu k - edge data is more complicated because of the two copper sites .",
    "nevertheless , the oxygen environment as seen from the coppers should be consistent with ( and therefore can help constrain ) the pr k - edge results .",
    "the fit results to the oxygen peaks show essentially no change in the number of nearest - neighbors , but indicate a broadening in the cu - o@xmath48 peak consistent with the 10% decrease in the peak height .",
    "if the pr - o distortion is completely radial , then a shortening of 0.18  would correspond to only a 0.04  lengthening of @xmath630% of the cu(2)-o(2,3 ) bonds , which is not resolvable in the fits .",
    "however , such a distortion will contribute to a broadening of the cu- o@xmath48 peak , and therefore the measured broadening is consistent with the proposed radial distortion in the pr - o bond .",
    "the small change in the number of y - o neighbors ( which can also be modeled as a slight increase in @xmath39 ) is also consistent with a radial distortion in the pr - o bonds .",
    "the fit results to the first oxygen peak from all three edges are consistent with a distortion of the pr - o bond in the radial direction of approximately 0.18  .",
    "this distortion may be due simply to a hybridization of the o 2_p _ and pr 4_f _ electrons .",
    "however , the magnitude of the shift is very consistent with some pr@xmath10 ; the best fit gives a pr - o@xmath49 bond length ( 2.27  ) which is close to the nearest - neighbor bond length in 8-fold coordinated pro@xmath0 . by constraining the broadening factors , we can obtain a much shorter bond length ( 2.15  ) which is more consistent with 6-fold coordinated bapro@xmath1 .",
    "the comparison to the 8-fold coordinated pro@xmath0 makes the most sense , since pr in pbco is 8-fold coordinated , although it is possible that not all the oxygens participate in pr - o bonds .",
    "if we assign all of the short pr - o bond lengths to the formal pr@xmath10 state , our fit results indicate that the pr is in that state 15 - 40% of the time , corresponding to a formal valence of + 3.33@xmath11 .",
    "such an assignment is reasonable for the shortest measured pr - o bond length , but if the bond length is closer to @xmath62.3  , then some could still include pr@xmath9 , as in bixbyite pr@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the upper limit on the valence range may be too high .",
    "likewise , the lower limit was obtained by forcing the broadening factor of the short bond to be much lower than in the best fit , which may not be reasonable .",
    "the possible disorder in the shorter pr - o bond could cause localization of charge carriers , and could be a byproduct of a 4_f_-2_p _ hybridization",
    ". on the other hand , since the disorder is greatest for the pbco sample , the disorder could be due to the less common pr@xmath10-pr@xmath10 combination , which will probably have different pr - o bond lengths than either the pr@xmath9-pr@xmath9 or the pr@xmath9-pr@xmath10 combinations .",
    "our measured dominant pr - o distance of 2.45@xmath280.01  is in excellent agreement with diffraction results@xcite that give a mean pr - o distance of 2.4539@xmath280.0038  .",
    "we see no evidence of a longer distance ( @xmath47 2.5  ) as suggested by the pr - o bond length trend with ionic radius.@xcite .",
    "fits that include such a peak invariably shift the peak back to the values we report .",
    "therefore , we must conclude that the discrepancy of this bond length with ionic radius is not directly due to a mixed valency .",
    "indeed , given the existence of a short pr - o bond , the long pr - o bond seems to be entirely pr@xmath9(4_f_@xmath13)-o .",
    "the range for the valence is in approximate agreement with the electronic studies mentioned in sec .",
    "[ introduction ] that give the valence of pr to be close to 3 + .",
    "however our results clearly suggest a higher formal valence than 3.0 , as was found in pr l - edge studies of horn _",
    "( 3.1 + for pbco)@xcite and lytle _ et al . _",
    "( 3.45 + for 20% pr and 3.25 + for 60% pr).@xcite in addition , our structural results show that the number of short pr - o bonds , that is , formal pr@xmath10 , increases with increasing pr concentration , and that any pr@xmath10 that may be present resides on the y site .",
    "both of these results are in contrast to the lytle _ et al .",
    "_ results .",
    "our result is in striking agreement with the 4 + / hybridization model put forth by fehrenbacher and rice,@xcite which predicts that the pr@xmath9 state will exist 60 - 70% of the time .",
    "a ligand hole localized on the pr - o(2)/o(3 ) bond would remove a hole from the conduction band and yield a formal pr@xmath10 site",
    ". the resulting pr@xmath10-o bond length would likely be significantly shorter than the pr@xmath9-o bond , based on the observed bond lengths in other materials . although we can not give a precise estimate of the number of short bonds present , our results are consistent with their prediction .",
    "the cu k - edge data for pbco are consistent with the diffraction results of lowe - ma and vanderah @xcite which show the axial oxygen ( o(4 ) ) to be pushed toward the planar cu site when compared to the ybco structure ( table [ table4 ] ) .",
    "the comparison to ybco is properly made by taking the differences in the lattice parameters a , b , and c into account .",
    "therefore , we also show the bond - lengths for `` pseudo - ybco '' which is calculated using the lattice parameters for pbco from lowe - ma and vanderah@xcite and the relative atomic positions of ybco from beno _",
    "et al._@xcite the difference in cu(2)-o(4 ) distance between the diffraction and the xafs results can be explained by comparing the cu(2)-o(4 ) distance as a function of oxygen concentration for r123-type materials . in all these materials that have been measured , the cu(2)-o(4 ) distance decreases with increasing oxygen concentration .",
    "our result is consistent with this trend ( see ref . ) .",
    "an extrapolation of the measured cu(2)-o(4 ) distance as a function of oxygen concentration in pbco,@xcite to an o content of 6.98 , yields a bond length of 2.23  , in excellent agreement with our result of 2.22  .",
    "an interesting property of r@xmath3pr@xmath4ba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 is that the larger the rare - earth radius , the lower the pr concentration required to completely suppress t@xmath5 .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that this is evidence for clustering of pr in ybco : pr ( where the ionic - size difference is comparatively large ) , thereby maximizing the superconducting y - y pairs of cells within a crystal .",
    "we had expected that both the pr and y k - edge data would be very sensitive to this clustering , by giving the number of neighboring y and pr atoms . the data in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] show a significant change in the structure near 3.5  where the y or pr neighbor peak occurs , compared to the pure materials ybco and pbco .",
    "this means that in the 30 and 50% samples there are both y and pr neighbors at each y / pr site .",
    "if large scale clustering were present , these significant changes in the xafs would not occur .",
    "unfortunately , fits that try to precisely determine the ratio of pr to y neighbors are plagued by the interference effects from the y - ba and y - y peaks , as described in sec .",
    "[ levely ] , which reduces our sensitivity .",
    "consequently , we can not differentiate between a random distribution and small clusters .",
    "in summary , we have collected xafs data on samples with several different concentrations of pr in y@xmath3pr@xmath4ba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 and on ceo@xmath0 at the y , pr , cu , and ce k - edges .",
    "the main result of this investigation is that the xafs data and analysis show that disorder in the oxygen environment around the praseodymium clearly exists .",
    "this disorder is most obvious when comparing the first oxygen peak in ceo@xmath0 to the first oxygen peak in prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 , which shows a 60% reduction in the pr - o peak .",
    "the amplitude of this peak clearly shrinks with increasing pr concentration .",
    "this pbco data is best fit by two harmonic radial distributions for the pr - o bond , which are centered at 2.27@xmath8  and 2.45@xmath280.01  in pbco .",
    "the shorter bond may be broader than the longer one by as much as a factor of 3 .",
    "the magnitude of this distortion agrees well with the change in bond length in other pr oxides between pr@xmath10-o ( 2.18  - 2.32  ) and pr@xmath9-o ( 2.33  - 2.66  ) and is therefore the first structural evidence of a split in the pr - o bond lengths , and strong evidence for a mixed valent state of pr in y@xmath3pr@xmath4ba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "we have also verified some results of previous measurements . by comparing the pr k - edge data to feff5 simulations of prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 with pr at the y site and at the ba or cu(2 ) site ,",
    "we see very little evidence for any of the pr existing on the ba or the cu(2 ) site ( upper limits of 8 and 10% , respectively ) .",
    "in addition , cu k - edge data indicate the o(4 ) site has moved closer to the cu(2 ) site ( in agreement with ref . ) and therefore may impede charge transfer between the planes and the chains .",
