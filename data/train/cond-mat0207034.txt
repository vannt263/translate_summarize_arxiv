    "it is customarily accepted that the system is an isotropic heisenberg ferromagnet with an extremely small anisotropy field@xcite@xcite .",
    "the tdae molecule , a strong electron donor , transfers one electron to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) of c@xmath0 in a similar way to that found in alkali metal c@xmath0 compounds .",
    "it has been established that the single - charged c@xmath0 alkali salts , a@xmath4c@xmath0 ( a= k , rb , cs ) , reveal metallic properties in a wide temperature range@xcite .",
    "although , analogously to the alkali metal c@xmath0 compounds , the valence band in tdea - c@xmath0 originates from the triply degenerated @xmath5 orbital of the c@xmath0 molecule , the tdae - c@xmath0 system was found to be non - metallic@xcite@xcite .",

    "magnetic susceptibility measurements@xcite@xcite@xcite as well as electron spin resonance ( esr ) results@xcite@xcite showed that the tdae - c@xmath0 system has only one @xmath6 magnetic moment per chemical formula unit . from the @xmath7-factor analysis",
    "it was concluded that the spins are mainly localized on c@xmath8 ( ref .",
    "the tdae@xmath2 donors should also carry non - paired electrons .",
    "however , these centers remain esr silent , which is probably due to the mechanism of the spin - singlet pairing resulting from the dimerization shift of the neighboring tdae@xmath2 molecules@xcite .",
    "two magnetic variants of tdae - c@xmath0 were discovered . as grown crystals ( @xmath9-phase )",
    "reveal the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) behavior , whereas annealed crystals ( @xmath10-phase ) show the transition to the ferromagnetic ( fm ) state@xcite .",

    "this reflection is not observed in the afm phase , which suggests the existence of a disordered ( glassy ) state of the c@xmath0 orientations .",

    "the sac is ruby - calibrated ; thus the hydrostatic pressure can be monitored in situ by detecting the pressure - induced shift of the red fluorescence of cr@xmath19 ions in a small crystal of ruby .",
    "the commercially available `` daphne '' oil was used as a pressure - transmitting medium . in this work ,",
    "the maximum applied pressure was of 9 kbar . for performing low temperature measurements ,",

    "the details of the dr - based high - pressure esr probe will be published shortly elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the esr line intensities and the @xmath7-factor were calibrated using an additional reference sample , a polycrystalline mno / mgo , which was positioned in the active zone of the microwave resonant structure ( close to the gasket of the sac ) .",
    "figure  [ figure1 ] shows the temperature evolution of the esr - probed spin susceptibility and the esr linewidth of the ferromagnetic phase of tdae - c@xmath0 measured at ambient pressure . in the ferromagnetic region , below @xmath21 k , the linewidth can not be determined precisely due to the strong distortion of the esr line shape .",
    "the line shape distortion is probably due to the non - homogeneity of the local internal fields in different ferromagnetic domains of the crystal .",

    "then , at @xmath25 kbar , a transition to the polymeric phase is clearly seen as a sudden drop in the esr linewidth ( fig .",
    "[ figure2]a ) .",
    "this is also accompanied by an abrupt change ( increase ) in the @xmath7-factor ( fig .",
    "[ figure2]b ) .",

    "these results are in a partial agreement with the esr measurements performed at lower microwave frequencies by mizoguchi et al.@xcite .",
    "the major difference is , however , that the critical pressure of suppression of the ferromagnetic transition in our measurements is rather lower and coincides with the pressure of the complete polymerization .    in the monomeric tdae - c@xmath0",
    "the esr linewidth is defined by dipolar interaction with additional narrowing introduced by the exchange interaction . accordingly , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figure2]a , the monomer s linewidth slowly narrows with pressure approaching 7 kbar .",
    "this is due to the larger overlap of the electronic wave functions , which leads to an enhanced exchange interaction . at ambient pressure ,",
    "the @xmath7-factor value for the monomeric phase of tdae - c@xmath0 is 2.0006 and is distinctively closer to the @xmath7-factor of the fullerene anion c@xmath8 ( @xmath26 ) than to the @xmath7-factor value that is characteristic for the tdae@xmath2 cation ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the esr signal originates from the electrons that are mainly localized on the c@xmath0 balls .",
    "the spins on the tdae@xmath2 radicals are esr - silent , which is probably due to a slight dimerization of tdae molecules , thus yielding a spin - singlet configuration . with increasing pressure , the @xmath7-factor linearly increases towards the value of the tdae@xmath2 cation .",
    "this implies that the unpaired spin density is spreading towards the tdae molecule with increasing pressure .    at @xmath28 7",
    "kbar , a sudden narrowing of the esr line is visible due to polymerization . the linewidth drops by two orders of magnitude , reaching @xmath22(polymer)= 0.5 g. the narrow linewidth and the currie type temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility at this pressure suggest that the polymeric phase is non - metallic . upon polymerization",
    "the @xmath7-factor value rises reaching 2.0024 and becomes almost pressure independent .",
    "mizoguchi et al.@xcite suggested that the polymerization process decouples the previously esr - silent spins related to the tdae@xmath2 , which should lead to an effective doubling of the total number of spins .",
    "the observed pressure dependence of esr susceptibility at room temperature ( fig .",
    "[ figure2]c ) does not support this suggestion . at this stage , a small increase ( of @xmath29 ) of the esr susceptibility upon polymerization can be explained by the differences in the weiss temperatures between the two phases .",
    "figure  [ figure3 ] shows the temperature dependence of the esr linewidth and the @xmath7-factor for three different pressures .",
    "the temperature dependence of the linewidth and the @xmath7-factor at applied pressure of @xmath30 2.6 kbar is shown in fig .",

    "[ figure3]a , below the characteristic temperature , @xmath31 k , in addition to the esr line of tdae - c@xmath0 monomer ( full circles ) , a new line appears ( open circles ) .",
    "this new esr line can be assigned to the polymeric phase while taking into account the @xmath7-factor and esr linewidth evolution with pressure .",
    "the intensity of the polymeric line does not exceed 15% of the intensity of the monomeric line .",
    "the temperature dependence of the @xmath7-factor and esr linewidth at @xmath30 4.7 kbar is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3]c and fig .",
    "[ figure3]d , respectively . at this pressure , a partial polymerization starts at higher temperatures , around @xmath32 k. the intensity of the polymeric line is now much more pronounced . for both applied pressures , the monomeric phase undergoes the ferromagnetic phase transition , whereas the polymeric phase does not . at pressure of @xmath30 7.0 kbar ,",
    "the sample is fully polymerized already at room temperature ( fig .",
    "[ figure3]e and fig.[figure3]f ) .",
    "no ferromagnetic phase transition is visible down to 5 k. at this applied pressure , the esr susceptibility follows a simple curie law , without a detectable weiss constant .",
    "the esr linewidth is very narrow ( @xmath33 g ) and is almost independent of temperature , whereas the @xmath7-factor slightly changes with temperature .",
    "= 0.45    the stability of the polymer phase in the @xmath1 parameter space is depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] .",
    "the polymerization temperature ( @xmath34 ) has a linear dependence with applied pressure , where the proportionality constant .",
    "the ratio of the polymeric and monomeric esr line intensities depends not only on pressure , but also on temperature . to deduce the exact structural dynamics of the polymer formation an additional structural study is needed .",
    "the pressure dependence of the ferromagnetic transition temperature ( @xmath35 ) of the monomeric phase is depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] . to determine @xmath35",
    ", we can not compare the resonance field shift with the conventional bloch s law , because the resonance field has pronounced temperature dependence even above @xmath35 ( see fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] ) .",
    "this shift is due to the demagnetization effects , which depend on the sample shape@xcite .",
    "concomitantly , we define @xmath35 as the onset temperature of the broadening of a linewidth distribution of the monomer - related esr features ( see : inset to fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] ) .",
    "this linewidth distribution broadening is due to the growth of an internal field below @xmath35 and the mosaicity of the crystal .",
    "the observed pressure dependence of @xmath35 is similar to the parabolic dependence reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , in contrast to their esr data acquired at low microwave frequencies and fields , the ferromagnetic transition observed in this work vanishes simultaneously with polymerization .",
    "this result can be expected and explained in the framework of the theory by kawamoto and coworkers@xcite , because the onset of polymerization prevents the antiferro ordering of the orbital of the jtd fullerene molecules .",
    "the polymeric phase remains stable even after the pressure is released .",
    "for the polymeric phase , the temperature dependences of the esr parameters are shown in fig .",

    "[ figure3]b , the low - temperature properties of the polymeric phase at ambient pressure are very similar to those observed at @xmath30 7 kbar .",
    "the temperature dependence of the inverse esr susceptibility , @xmath36 , of the polymeric phase is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure6]a .",
    "since we are dealing with localized spins , this type of plot ( @xmath36 vs. t ) is the most informative , directly yielding information on the curie constant and the weiss temperature of the system .",
    "the spin susceptibility below the room temperature reveals one spin @xmath37 1/2 per chemical formula unit ( @xmath38 1 ) and a simple curie behavior .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ figure6]a , the inverse susceptibility departs from the simple curie behavior at 260 k. this transition region is relatively broad and extends up to ca .",
    "320 k. above 320 k , the esr susceptibility reveals the doubling of the number of spins per chemical formula .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood in terms of re - appearance of the previously hidden spins of the tdae@xmath2 radicals .",
    "the weiss temperature does not vanish anymore , having the value of @xmath39 k. this change of behavior at high temperatures is also seen in the temperature dependence of the linewidth ( fig .",
    "[ figure6]b ) . at lower temperatures",
    "the @xmath22 is almost constant , with a slight tendency to decrease with increasing temperature , whereas above the room temperature it changes its slope and starts to increase more rapidly .",
    "the temperature dependence of the @xmath7-factor ( fig .  [ figure6]c ) reveals a similar , distinctive change of behavior above the room temperature .",
    "= 0.40    the polymeric phase remains stable up to the depolymerization temperature , @xmath40 k. above this temperature , both the @xmath22 and the @xmath7-factor recover their characteristic values for the ferromagnetic phase ( fig .",

    "the depolymerization process is an irreversible transition . at the depolymerization temperature ,",
    "both polymeric and ferromagnetic esr features are present , thus pointing to the coexistence of the two phases .",
    "it also suggests that this phase transition does not seem to be an abrupt one . as in the case of ferromagnetism ,",
    "the polymerization process might be influenced by percolation mechanism , as the samples of apparently lesser quality exhibit a bit lower depolymerization temperature .    at low temperatures ,",
    "the depolymerized crystals reveal the same temperature dependences of the esr parameters as those observed for the ferromagnetic crystals .",
    "the @xmath7-factor shifts remarkably below 15 k , which indicates that the depolymerized crystal undergoes the ferromagnetic phase transition .",
    "in the intermediate pressure range , below @xmath25 kbar , the tdae - c@xmath0 monomer partially polymerizes on cooling .",
    "both the polymerization temperature ( @xmath34 ) and the relative ratio of the polymeric to the monomeric fractions depend on pressure ( fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ) .",
    "preliminary analysis@xcite has suggested that the polymer would have a linear [ 2 + 2 ] cycloadduct bonding structure with a similar intra - chain ball distance as in the case of rb@xmath41c@xmath0 ( ref .",
    "the most prominent difference between the systems is a much larger inter - chain distance in the case of tdae - c@xmath0 , which is due to the large size and anisotropic ( steric ) properties of the tdae interstitials .",
    "= 0.40    rich phase diagrams have already been reported for several c@xmath0-related compounds .",
    "in particular , interesting phase transitions were found for rb@xmath41c@xmath0 .",
    "depending on cooling rate and quenching , it can form either monomeric , dimeric@xcite or polymeric phases@xcite@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the coexistence of the two phases has never been observed for rb@xmath41c@xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , the coexistence of two phases at low temperatures was observed in the case of single - bonded linear polymers of na@xmath42rbc@xmath0 system@xcite . in that case , the partial polymerization can be explained by steric effects and by disorder resulting from different possible directions of the bond formation .",
    "in contrast , tdae - c@xmath0 is a strongly anisotropic structure with the only one possible direction of the bond formation ( c - axis ) .",
    "hence , the partial polymerization is probably governed by the orientation disorder of jtd - c@xmath0 molecules .",
    "the polymerization temperature , @xmath34 , is much lower than the freezing temperature of the c@xmath0 molecule rotation for a given pressure .",
    "this suggests that the freezing of molecular orientations is not sufficient for initiating the polymerization process and there exists a kinetic barrier for this phase transition .",
    "it seems to be natural that different kinetic barriers can characterize various relative orientations of the jtd - c@xmath0 molecules . as the remaining monomeric phase still shows a pronounced ferromagnetic order , most probably , the fm molecular configuration has the highest energetic barrier .",
    "it follows from our measurements that the depolymerization of tdae - c@xmath0 occurs at the higher temperature than in the case of one - dimensional a@xmath41c@xmath0 polymers ( a= k , rb , cs ) , where , depending on the compound , @xmath43 varies in the range of @xmath44 k ( ref .",
    "it seems that @xmath43 of tdae - c@xmath0 is rather comparable to that found for the two - dimensional polymer na@xmath45c@xmath0 ( @xmath46 k)@xcite .",
    "therefore , the polymeric chains of tdae - c@xmath0 seem to form much more stable structures than the double - bonded polymeric chains of the rb@xmath41c@xmath0 system .",
    "if the intra - chain bounds of both tdae - c@xmath0 and rb@xmath41c@xmath0 were of the same nature ( isostructural ) , one would expect for them similar temperature stability .",
    "the observed discrepancy in the temperature stability can be ascribed to a potential structural difference in the two polymeric structures .",
    "alternatively , the previously not investigated effects of dopant molecule and the inter - chain coupling can be important for the polymeric chain stability .",
    "a precise structural analysis is needed to answer these questions .",
    "below room temperature ( @xmath47 k ) , the esr spin susceptibility of the polymerized @xmath48phase follows a simple curie law with one spin @xmath6 per chemical formula .",
    "this indicates that spins probed by the esr experiment are localized .",
    "moreover , in this temperature range , the esr linewidth for the polymerized @xmath48phase is very narrow ( @xmath33 g ) and almost temperature independent , which suggests strong exchange interactions between the spins .",
    "the theoretical band calculations , however , predict that in the absence of electron correlations , the isolated single - charged , double - bonded linear polymer should be metallic with a half - filled band@xcite . also , the same property holds well for single - bonded linear polymers encountered in na@xmath42ac@xmath0 systems@xcite .",
    "indeed , all the other charged linear polymers of the c@xmath0 compounds , discovered to date , are metallic in a wide temperature range , with possible ground - state instabilities , such as spin - density wave@xcite .",
    "therefore , the tdae - c@xmath0 polymeric phase seems to be unique .",
    "the inter - chain coupling is very important in alkali fullerides a@xmath41c@xmath0 , influencing their dimensionality .",
    "however , according to erwin et al .",
    "@xcite , a direct inter - chain coupling interaction can be neglected in tdae - c@xmath0 based on the large inter - chain separation found in these systems .    assuming a simple model",
    ", one would expect the tdae - c@xmath0 polymer should be a strongly anisotropic metal .",
    "the effective strong localization observed in the @xmath48phase of tdae - c@xmath0 might suggest that its actual polymer topology essentially differs from that of rb@xmath41c@xmath0 . alternatively",
    ", the localization effect might originate from the possible enhancement of the effective coulomb repulsion at c@xmath0 sites , due to the influence of the tdea@xmath2 radicals . in such a mott - hubbard localization scheme",
    ", one would expect a non - vanishing weiss constant .",
    "in contrast , the presence of the weiss constant has not been detected in the low - temperature @xmath48phase .",
    "mizoguchi et al.@xcite suggested that the absence of the weiss parameter could be explained by re - activation of the positive exchange coupling with the spins of tdae@xmath2 radicals .",
    "this , in turn , would fortuitously cancel the negative inter - c@xmath0 spin coupling leading to a diminishing weiss constant .",
    "nevertheless , in this work , we did not observe the complete recovery of the tdae@xmath2 spins in the polymeric phase at the room temperature , as claimed by mizoguchi et al .",
    "indeed , the appearance of tdae - spins at elevated temperatures is accompanied with development of the antiferromagnetic weiss constant .    assuming that polymeric chains in the @xmath12-tdae - c@xmath0 have rather small sizes and are disordered",
    ", one can apply a model of the random - exchange afm heisenberg 1d chains . in this case , the weiss temperature would be absent , whereas the esr susceptibility should be proportional to @xmath49 , where @xmath50 . fitting this model to our data yields @xmath51 .",
    "clearly , this result does not support the above - mentioned model . for right now , a plausible reason for non - appearance of the weiss temperature in the polymer phase remains unclear .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figure6]a , in the polymeric @xmath48phase , a complete recovery of the tdae@xmath2-related spins is not observed at ambient temperature .",
    "the recovery of the spins occurs rather at higher temperatures , with full development at 320 k. the dynamics of the tdae@xmath2-related spins is probably connected to small movements of the tdae@xmath2 molecules leading to the dimerization shift@xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the polymerization mechanism in tdae - c@xmath0 ferromagnetic system and the physical properties of the polymeric @xmath12-phase .",
    "the complete polymerization at room temperature is observed at the pressure of 7 kbar . at the same pressure ,",
    "the ferromagnetic transition is suppressed .",
    "partial polymerization is observed at lower pressures and temperatures , and the stability of the polymeric phase was established in the @xmath1 parameter space .",
    "the high depolymerization temperature suggests that the polymeric chains are much more stable than in the case of double - bonded linear polymers of the rb@xmath41c@xmath0 systems . to deduce the exact structural properties of the polymer , an additional high - resolution x - ray diffraction study is needed .    moreover , the observed strong localization of spins in the polymeric tdae - c@xmath0 is in contradiction with conclusions from a simple theoretical reasoning and it is not comparable to any other charged linear polymer of the c@xmath0 . above 320 k ,",
    "the previously silent spins on the tdae - c@xmath0 are revealed .",
    "the observed decoupling of the tdae@xmath2 spins is accompanied by the appearance of the weiss constant .    in summary ,",
