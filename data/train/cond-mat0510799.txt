    "a considerable number of attempts have been made at clarifying the phase structure of the surface model of helfrich , polyakov , and kleinert @xcite ; henceforce we will refer to this as the hpk model . tethered surface models are defined on triangulated fixed connectivity surfaces representing polymerized biological membranes or membranes in the gel phase @xcite , and they are classified into a major class of the hpk model @xcite .",
    "fluid surface models are considered a different class of the hpk model defined on dynamically triangulated surfaces representing these biological membranes in the fluid phase , however , we will not discuss the fluid surface model in this paper @xcite .    an interesting problem that remains unanswered at present",
    "is whether the tethered self - intersecting ( or phantom ) surface model undergoes a continuous transition or a discontinuous one .",
    "the model is expected to undergo a phase transition separating the smooth phase in the limit @xmath0 from the crumpled one in the limit @xmath1 .",
    "the mean field analysis predicts that the model undergoes a discontinuous phase transition @xcite , whereas the large-@xmath2 expansion predicts a continuous transition @xcite .",
    "biological membranes including artificial vesicles were thought to undergo the crumpling transition .",
    "however , we currently have no experimental evidence for such a transition in biological membranes , except for an investigation on artificial vesicles @xcite .    in a recent numerical study",
    ", it was reported that the tethered model of hpk undergoes a first - order phase transition on spherical surfaces relatively larger than those used so far @xcite .",
    "the bending energy and the gaussian term used in @xcite are those widely accepted as standard discrete hamiltonians in numerical studies on the hpk model .",
    "the bending energy is of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the unit normal vector of the triangle @xmath5 .",
    "the gaussian term is given by the sum of bond length squares .",
    "however , it has not yet been clarified whether the order of phase transition depends on the discretization of the hamiltonian .",
    "if the order of phase transition changes depending on the choice of the discretization , the phase transition might be seen only in the lattice models , and as a consequence we can obtain no information on the phase transition of the continuous model by using the numerical simulations .",
    "hence , it is natural to consider that the order of the transition depends on the discretization of hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to investigate further the tethered model defined by hamiltonian which is different from the above - mentioned bending energy and gaussian term .    in this paper , we studied three types of tethered models on triangulated spherical surfaces , which are obtained by dividing the icosahedron as in @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the first model contains the ordinary gaussian energy and a bending energy , which is defined by the normal vector of vertices .",
    "hence , the discretization of the bending energy in the first model is slightly different from that of the standard bending energy .",
    "it was previously reported that the first model undergoes a discontinuous transition on voronoi lattices @xcite .",
    "however , it remains unclear whether the discontinuous transition can be seen on any other lattices .",
    "thus , we can also check that the discontinuous transition is independent of the lattice structure by investigating the first model defined on lattices constructed from the icosahedron .",
    "the second model is called the nambu - goto surface model @xcite . at present , it is unclear whether the nambu - goto model undergoes a discontinuous phase transition when the model is defined on surfaces with extrinsic curvature .",
    "the area energy , which is given by the sum of the area of the triangles , corresponds to the gaussian energy in the first ( hpk ) model .",
    "it is well - known that the nambu - goto model without the bending energy term is not well - defined due to the lack of the smooth phase and the appearance of spikes on the surface @xcite .",
    "the area term imposes a constraint only on the area of the triangles , and hence allows the appearance of spiky configurations made up of oblong triangles . on the contrary",
    ", some additional terms in the hamiltonian can make the model well - defined .",
    "in fact , it was reported recently that the nambu - goto model with a deficit angle term , which is an intrinsic curvature , is well - defined and undergoes a discontinuous transition between the smooth phase and a tubular phase @xcite .",
    "the second model in this paper is also well - defined @xcite , because the hamiltonian includes a bending energy , which is an extrinsic curvature defined according to the dual lattice formulation of the discrete mechanics by lee @xcite .",
    "the third model is a tensionless model whose hamiltonian contains the standard bending energy and a hard - wall potential which gives an upper bound on the bond length .",
    "there is no gaussian term in the hamiltonian .",
    "the bending energy of the model is identical to the one in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the discretization of the third model is the same as in @xcite .",
    "however , it is not yet clear whether a tensionless tethered model undergoes a discontinuous transition .",
    "it is nontrivial whether those three discrete models lead to the same result on the order of the transition .",
    "the standard bending energy for the hpk model is not equivalent to the above mentioned bending energy for the nambu - goto surface model .",
    "in fact , the nambu - goto model with the standard bending energy is ill - defined because of the lack of the smooth phase and the appearance of spikes in the whole region of the bending rigidity @xcite .",
    "thus , it is worthwhile to study numerically whether these three models have the same continuous limit for the order of the transition .",
    "we will see that the three models undergo a discontinuous transition on spherical surfaces relatively larger than those used to date , and then we will understand that the discontinuous transition of the model is independent of the discretization of the hamiltonian . therefore , the results obtained in this paper together with those in @xcite lead us to conclude that a first - order phase transition can be observed in a spherical tethered surface model defined by hamiltonian that includes a bending energy term .",

    "this paper aimed to show that the first - order transition of the tethered surface model for biological membranes is independent of the discretization of the hamiltonian .",
    "three types of tethered surface models were investigated . the first model ( model 1 )",
    "is a discrete model of helfrich and polyakov - kleinert , the second ( model 2 ) is that of nambu - goto , and the third ( model 3 ) is a tensionless model of helfrich and polyakov - kleinert .",
    "the first and the second models are closely related to each other in the context of the string model .    the canonical mc simulations were carried out on spherical surfaces of size up to @xmath85 for model 1 , @xmath91 for model 2 , and @xmath98 for model 3 , where the lattices were constructed by dividing the icosahedron",
    ". a discrete form of the hamiltonian of model 1 is a linear combination of the gaussian term and a bending energy term , which is defined by using a normal vector of vertices .",
    "the hamiltonian of model 2 contains an area term and a bending energy term , which makes the model well - defined .",
    "the hamiltonian of model 3 contains a bending energy term and a hard - wall potential , which gives an upper bound on the bond length .",
    "the first - order transition of models 1 , 2 , and 3 were observed on lattices of size @xmath218 , @xmath219 , and @xmath220 , respectively .",
    "we have shown in this paper that the first - order crumpling transition is universal on spherical surfaces of the extrinsic curvature models for biological membranes .",
    "in fact , we have found that the first - order transition is independent of a choice of hamiltonian of the tethered surface model , if it is discretized on a sphere .",
    "therefore , the results obtained in this paper together with those in @xcite lead us to conclude that a first - order phase transition can be observed in a spherical tethered surface model whose hamiltonian includes a bending energy term .",
    "it is also found that the hausdorff dimension @xmath221 in the smooth phase at the transition point is almost identical to the topological dimension @xmath149 and is also independent of the discretization of the hamiltonian . on the contrary , a choice of discretization of the hamiltonian influences the scaling property of @xmath99 in the crumpled phase at the transition point .",
    "nevertheless , we consider that the crumpled state of the model is not a phantom one but a real physical one , because the hausdorff dimension of the crumpled phase in model 2 is @xmath222 , which is less than the physical bound and is also comparable to the result in @xcite .    finally , we emphasize that our results suggest that biological membranes can exhibit the crumpling transition .",
    "experimental investigations on the crumpling transition are expected .",
