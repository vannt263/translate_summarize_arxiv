    "still , we caution that this is an approximate cross - check only , because various caveats are unaccounted for ( e.g. ,  can not resolve the nucleus with its nominal 65 beam ; and , the w3 bandpass is broad enough to be affected by various emission and absorption features ) .",

    "one important difference is that the obscuring column density of gas to the nucleus of cen a is significantly lower and compton - thin ( @xmath010@xmath141 @xmath5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the question of the origin and abundance of dust in early - type galaxies remains to be settled .",
    "detailed photometric analyses have revealed the presence of extended dust lanes , filaments or disks in _ most _ systems with high quality observational data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this sfr is a few times higher than that of the milky way , and about an order of magnitude larger than in typical early - type systems @xcite . in order to estimate",

    "would increase the mass by a further factor of 3 .",
    "but high columns of hot _ nuclear _ dust and associated obscuring gas in typical early - type systems remain rare .",
    "only about 3%  of bat agn are hosted in ellipticals @xcite , with none identified as being ct thus far .",
    "thus , confirmation of the exact morphological class of 565  is important .",
    "if it turns out to be of e - type , it would be the first of its kind .",
    "565  is a member of a wide pair with eso  565g018 @xcite , separated by a projected distance of @xmath2717  kpc .",
    "[ fig : esor ] shows that eso  565g018 appears to be elongated along their separation line .",
    "if the nuclear activity in 565  is a result of neighbor interaction , this is not accompanied by significant morphological disruption of its host .",
    "simulations of galaxy mergers show that pronounced star formation and nuclear activity can follow close encounters between the merging pair ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this means that eso  565g018 and eso565g019 have likely undergone at least one close passage already .",
    "we have discussed the elevated sfr in 565  as inferred from its high total ir luminosity .",
    "its neighbor eso  565g018 is about a factor of 10 fainter in the optical and ir , and has remained undetected with both  and  in the far - ir .",
    "[ fig : sed ] compares the broadband seds of the two galaxies .",
    "so , if a close interaction is ongoing , it appears to have triggered elevated star formation in one system but not the other .    in this respect , the interaction may be similar to that of m81 and m82  the nearest galaxy pair where a close interaction has led to a well - studied nuclear starburst and pronounced morphological distortion in m82 ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) but not its neighbor",
    ". a perigalactic approach of @xmath021 kpc between the pair occurred about 0.5 gyr ago ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) , triggering a burst of star cluster formation at that time @xcite .",
    "the present starburst is associated with later nuclear infall of tidally disrupted interstellar material ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if the two pairs of galaxies were similar , then we may expect to find tidal signatures in the eso  565 pair in deep multi - wavelength imaging .",
    "but unlike m82 which is dominated by its disk , eso  565g019 is bulge - dominated .",
    "this may well render it more resilient to interaction - induced morphological changes ( see , e.g. , the simulations by @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , one may also expect agn activity in m82 , similar to that seen in eso  565g019 . but",
    "despite long efforts to locate ongoing accretion onto any super - massive black hole , none has been identified so far @xcite , which perhaps emphasizes importance of supernova feedback in disrupting continuous accretion onto any agn in m82 over the past 0.5 gyr .",
    "finally , we also mention the study of @xcite , who investigate the co - evolution of starbursts and agn in a large sample of ir - selected galaxy mergers . according to their optical spectral line diagnostics ,",
    "565  is strongly agn - dominated ( @xmath145 in their terminology ) .",
    "overall , agn dominance and total ir luminosity increase with the progression of a merger in their sample , but 565  is unusual in being highly agn - dominated despite its wide binary separation and moderate ir luminosity .",
    "this suggests that even if an interaction with eso  565g018 is ongoing , additional influences ought to be examined .",
    "the early - type morphological classification of 565  suggests that it may already be in the final stages of a past major merger , with a mature spheroid being the end product and the remnants of the merger now providing the gas which obscures and feeds the nucleus . in this scenario , however , 565  would not follow the now - popular merger and feedback - driven evolutionary scheme of symbiotic agn and galaxy growth ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which energetic feedback from accretion can clear away accreting gas and results in a dead  super - massive black hole at the nucleus .",
    "the nucleus of 565  is obviously surrounded by plentiful gas and growing at a radiatively - efficient rate at present .    instead",
    ", perhaps a more likely possibility is that a recent minor merger of a small system with eso  565g019 may have triggered enhanced nuclear activity , especially if the merger was wet  and brought in a large amount of gas",
    ". such mergers should be quite common , a hypothesis supported by simulations and observations , though they are not easy to identify .",
    "for instance , in simulations carried out by @xcite , it was found that a typical 10:1 merger of a disk system with a dwarf galaxy can briefly elevate sfrs by factors of a few , as appears to be the case for eso  565g019 . with regard to observational evidence",
    ", @xcite recently discovered a highly compact agn pair in the spiral galaxy ngc  3393  thought to be the result of a minor merger in which both agn of the pair are hidden by ct obscuration .",
    "simulations by @xcite have shown that in minor mergers , the smaller system of the pair undergoes distinct episodes of enhanced accretion that greatly promote its growth as compared to the growth of the larger black hole .",
    "this implies that many more such minor merger pairs with both black hole components actively accreting ought to be widely detectable .",
    "[ fig : esor ] shows an apparent asymmetry in the nuclear regions of 565 , which could be disruption related to minor merger activity .",
    "if so , this would be the first minor - merger  driven reflection - dominated agn in an early - type galaxy .",
    "a double agn may then also be present .",
    "high angular resolution optical , x - ray and ir imaging in the future should be able to help distinguish between the various possibilities discussed above and also shed light on the relevance of any secular processes involved in triggering the observed nuclear activity .",
    "we have presented the first x - ray spectrum of 565  below 10 kev , as well as broadband x - ray spectral modeling . a reflection - dominated nuclear continuum and prodigious fe fluorescence emission",
    "have been revealed with .",
    "the line - of - sight obscuring column density is greater than 1.6@xmath310@xmath4 @xmath5 ( 90% confidence ) and the fe k@xmath1 equivalent width with respect to the observed continuum is close to 1 kev .",
    "there is evidence of hard x - ray variability when comparing our  data with the long - term /bat average spectrum .",
    "this object is one of the few bona fide reflection - dominated agn known to be hosted in an early - type galaxy .",
    "mid- and far - infrared detections point to the likely presence of massive quantities of large - scale dust and on - going star - formation in the host .",
    "the most likely scenario for triggering nuclear activity is a minor merger , though there may also be an ongoing interaction with its neighbor eso  565g018 .",
    "our work shows that other reflection - dominated agn will be uncovered in the nearby universe once the sensitivity of hard x - ray selection increases .",
