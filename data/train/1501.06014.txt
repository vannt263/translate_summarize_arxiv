    "diatomic ultralong - range rydberg molecules consisting of a rydberg atom whose electron , upon frequent scattering off a ground state atom , binds the atom , localized at large distances ( @xmath1 bohr radii ) , to the ion core of the rydberg atom were predicted theoretically in ref .",
    "a subset of these rydberg molecules with s - wave dominated electronic orbitals were later observed @xcite .",
    "this initial experimental work was followed by a flurry of new observations of rydberg molecules with a variety of electronic and rovibrational structures @xcite . for electronic @xmath0-wave scattering of the rydberg electron from the ground state atom ,",
    "two types of ultralong - range molecular states can be distinguished : the non - polar , low angular momentum quantum defect states and the polar , high angular momentum `` trilobite '' states .",
    "theoretically , some aspects of these high angular momentum states have been explored , notably the semiclassical nature of the rich oscillatory structure in the adiabatic potential energy surfaces @xcite , their large permanent electric dipole moments @xcite , as well as the precise control over their electronic properties and molecular orientation by static electric and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "further emphasis has been laid on polyatomic systems consisting of a rydberg atom bound to two or more ground state atoms @xcite or to a diatomic polar perturber @xcite .",
    "theoretical approaches to describe ultralong - range rydberg molecules can be divided into two categories : methods using the fermi pseudopotential@xcite and methods using the quantum defect approach @xcite- for a recent overview , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "although the two approaches are expected to be equivalent , they indeed differ in numerical implementation @xcite and are even used alternatively @xcite .    in this work we therefore aim at a concise analysis of the origin of the discrepancies obtained from these two approaches .",
    "we thereby point out the interconnection and limitations in both approaches which should be taken into consideration in future studies of ultralong - range rydberg molecules .",
    "specifically , we show that a pseudopotential modeled by a bare delta function potential leads to non - converging molecular potential energy curves in basis set diagonalization of the electronic hamiltonian .",
    "modeling the pseudopotential instead by a regularized delta function reproduces potential energy curves which agree exactly with those obtained by the quantum defect theory approach . throughout our analysis",
    "we not only give limits of the bare delta function potential but also its validity as an approximation in first order perturbation theory .",
    "this ultimately links the two approaches .",
    "we consider a rydberg atom whose ionic core is located at the origin and a neutral ground state atom located at the position @xmath2 within the rydberg electron orbit . in the born - oppenheimer ( bo )",
    "approximation , the electronic hamiltonian for this rydberg molecule reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the hamiltonian describing the rydberg electron in its ionic core potential and @xmath5 is the interaction between the rydberg electron and the neutral ground state atom which we call from now on the perturber . if @xmath6 is short - ranged , the corresponding electronic wave function @xmath7 outside the range of @xmath6 can be determined from the scattering phase shifts induced by @xmath6 .",
    "although a more general treatment is possible , here we focus exclusively on pure @xmath0-wave electron - perturber scattering .    in the region where the electron is near the perturber , but outside of the range of @xmath6 , the electron wave function behaves as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is",
    "the relative electron - perturber coordinate and @xmath10 is the @xmath0-wave phase shift depending on the wave vector @xmath11 given semiclassically as @xmath12 the @xmath0-wave scattering length of the potential @xmath6 is obtained from @xmath13=-\\tan ( \\delta(k))/k$ ] , which in the low energy limit behaves as @xmath14= a[0 ] + \\frac{\\pi}{3 } \\alpha[0 ] k + \\mathcal{o}(k^2 ) \\label{eqn : scatlength}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 $ ] is the zero - energy scattering length and @xmath16 $ ] is the zero - frequency ( static ) polarizability of the ground state atom ( polarized in the charge - atom interaction ) @xcite . the momentum @xmath11 can be considered to be small ( low - energy limit ) because @xmath17 in ( [ eqn : k ] ) is typically large and close to the classical turning points .",
    "the idea behind the fermi pseudopotential approach is to replace @xmath6 by a zero - range pseudopotential that possesses the same @xmath0-wave scattering length as the original potential , while the quantum defect approach replaces the potential @xmath6 by the dirichlet boundary condition ( [ eqn : psi_semiclassic ] ) .",
    "the pseudopotential usually employed to describe the @xmath0-wave binding of ultralong - range rydberg molecules @xcite is the bare delta function potential @xmath18 \\delta({\\mathbf{r}}-{\\mathbf{r } } ) , \\label{eqn : pseudopotential}\\ ] ] where the scattering length @xmath13 $ ] depends on the energy @xmath19 and the perturber position @xmath2 via ( [ eqn : k ] ) and ( [ eqn : scatlength ] ) . in the case that one is interested only in energies",
    "@xmath19 close to some reference energy @xmath20 one may approximate @xmath21 we now consider the energy shift of the electronic rydberg orbit by the perturbing potential @xmath6 where @xmath22 is an eigenstate of the bare rydberg hamiltonian with eigen energy @xmath20 : @xmath23 for a compact notation we choose the basis states @xmath22 such that they diagonalize @xmath6 inside energetically degenerate submanifolds , i.e. @xmath24 if @xmath25 . using ( [ eqn : k_fix ] ) , we deduce from ( [ eqn : pseudopotential ] ) the first order perturbation theory correction to @xmath20 as @xmath26 \\left|\\varphi_i({\\mathbf{r}})\\right|^2 , \\label{eqn : first_order_fermi}\\ ] ] which is the bo potential , valid for low angular momentum quantum defect , as well as for high angular momentum `` trilobite '' states .    as an example we consider the @xmath27 state studied in @xcite .",
    "the correspondent eigenstates of @xmath28 are the quantum defect states @xmath29 that possess the energies @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes the @xmath32-dependent quantum defect .",

    "the e@xmath42-rb(5s ) triplet scattering length has been calculated in @xcite and the polarizability is obtained from @xcite .",
    "the bo potential energy curve @xmath43 is shown ( red dashed line ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] . at @xmath44 , it possesses a minimum that lies 26 mhz below the dissociation limit ( here set to zero ) and supports several bound states .",

    "[ sec : regular ] , one reason for the discrepancy between @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath15 $ ] , which has not been fully understood so far , is the effect of couplings between non - degenerate @xmath22 and @xmath48 basis states that , at the level of first order perturbation theory , are neglected in ( [ eqn : first_order_fermi ] ) but lead to deeper binding energies .",
    "this coupling becomes especially important in cases where the quantum defect of the state in question is close to an integer value .",
    "to take the couplings into account , which means to analyze the system beyond the first order perturbation theory , we diagonalize @xmath49 numerically in an extended basis set .",
    "technically this is done by fixing @xmath11 as in ( [ eqn : k_fix ] ) to some energy @xmath20 and diagonalizing @xmath49 in a basis set of states range - bound to a certain number of quantum defect eigenstates @xmath29 whose energies lie close to @xmath20 .",
    "in the case of @xmath27 , we choose @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , it is convenient to group the basis states into manifolds of similar energy , that we call @xmath51-manifolds .",
    "each consists of the three quantum defect states @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and the @xmath55 energetically degenerate states @xmath56 . for practical purposes and without loss of generality , we can neglect states with @xmath57 .",
    "the projection of the electronic angular momentum onto the internuclear @xmath2 axis parallel to the @xmath58-axis is a good quantum number .",
    "states with @xmath57 have vanishing density on the @xmath58-axis and hence show no interaction via the potential @xmath6 .",
    "the resulting bo potential energy curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] : using only the @xmath59 manifold gives the bo energy @xmath60 ( cyan dots ) , including the @xmath51-manifolds with @xmath61 leads to the bo energy @xmath62 ( light blue dots ) and taking @xmath63 results in the bo energy @xmath64 ( dark blue dashed - dotted line ) .",
    "here every increase in the size of the basis set leads to considerably lower potential curves .",
    "surprisingly , even for large basis sets consisting of up to 10 @xmath51-manifolds , the potential curves do not converge .",
    "the following calculation shows that this non - convergence is not a numerical artifact but inherent to the bare delta function potential used for the electron - perturber interaction and the diagonalization procedure .",
    "we will illuminate this in the following .",
    "let us consider the finite subspace @xmath65 spanned by @xmath66 eigenstates @xmath22 and investigate the diagonalization of @xmath49 inside @xmath65 in more detail .",
    "the projection of the schrdinger equation @xmath67 onto @xmath65 reads @xmath68\\varphi_i^*({\\mathbf{r}})\\varphi_j({\\mathbf{r } } ) \\right]\\alpha_j = e \\alpha_i   \\label{eqn : matrix}\\ ] ] where we made the ansatz @xmath69 consequently , ( [ eqn : psi_expansion ] ) will lead to the exact solution of ( [ eqn : schroedinger ] ) in the limit @xmath70 .",

    "yields the characteristic equation @xmath73 \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{|\\varphi_i({\\mathbf{r}})|^2}{e^0_i - e}=0 \\ .",
    "\\label{eqn : energy_bare}\\ ] ] the roots @xmath19 of ( [ eqn : energy_bare ] ) are now exactly the eigenvalues that one would obtain by a numerical diagonalization of ( [ eqn : matrix ] ) . however ,",
    "in contrast to numerical diagonalization methods there is no need to perform the approximation ( [ eqn : k_fix ] ) for the involved @xmath11-vector in numerical root finding algorithms .",
    "hence , ( [ eqn : energy_bare ] ) is even more general .    to see the effects of diagonalization inside large basis sets ,",
    "we take the limit @xmath70 .",
    "the sum in ( [ eqn : energy_bare ] ) can then be replaced by the green s function of @xmath28 @xmath74 evaluated in the limit @xmath75 , where the sum above includes discrete and continuum states . however , for @xmath76 the green s function diverges as @xmath77 therefore the characteristic equation ( [ eqn : energy_bare ] ) possesses for @xmath70 no well defined solution @xmath19 .",
    "this explains the nonconvergent behavior that we encounter with increasing size of the basis set for the diagonalization , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] .",
    "in the literature it is well known that the usefulness of a delta function potential in three dimensions is restricted since its action on irregular wave functions is not well defined and its spectrum is unbounded from below @xcite .",

    "\\label{eqn : energy_regularized}\\ ] ] in contrast to ( [ eqn : energy_bare ] ) this equation is not restricted to finite regions of the hilbert space and yet well defined .",
    "it is crucial to carry out the summation before taking the derivative in ( [ eqn : matrixreg ] ) and ( [ eqn : energy_regularized ] ) as the opposite , i.e. shifting the derivative into the sum , would again lead to irregularities , due to ( [ eqn : g_divergence ] ) . to this end , we insert explicitly the green s function ( [ eqn : g_expansion ] ) into ( [ eqn : energy_regularized ] ) which yields @xmath82 g^{0}_{{\\rm{reg}}}({\\mathbf{r}},{\\mathbf{r}},e)=0 \\",

    "\\label{eqn : regularization}\\ ] ] this is exactly the result obtained alternatively via the quantum defect theory in @xcite and agrees nicely with the expectation that the pseudopotential approach and the quantum defect approach should result in equivalent potential curves .",
    "( [ eqn : energy_green ] ) can be evaluated numerically by expressing the green s function in ( [ eqn : g_expansion ] ) in terms of whittaker functions , which is possible for arbitrary quantum defects @xcite .",
    "the bo potential energy curve @xmath84 obtained in this manner for the @xmath27 state with the parameters ( [ eqn : parameters ] ) is shown ( orange dashed curve ) in fig [ fig : comparison ] .",
    "compared to the first order perturbation theory results , the outer minimum is around 30% deeper and shifted towards smaller @xmath17 .",
    "this is an indication of the contribution of higher @xmath32-states and explains why the observed binding energies in @xcite were larger than expected from the first order perturbation approximation ( [ eqn : first_order_fermi ] ) . in @xcite ,",
    "this was compensated partially by the introduction of an effective scattering length @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "more analytical insight is gained by performing first order perturbation theory with ( [ eqn : delta_regular ] ) .",
    "additional care is necessary when using the regularized delta function potential in standard perturbation theory , due to the non - commutativity of summation and differential operations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the first order corrections @xmath85 to the energy @xmath86 can be obtained in the normal manner as @xmath87 \\int d^3r \\varphi^*_i({\\mathbf{r } } )   \\delta({\\mathbf{r}}-{\\mathbf{r } } ) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial   \\rho }   \\rho \\varphi_i({\\mathbf{r } } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 2 \\pi a[k(r , e_i^{0 } ] \\left|\\varphi_i({\\mathbf{r}})\\right|^2   \\label{eqn : firstorder}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where energetically degenerate @xmath79 are chosen such that they diagonalize @xmath6 in the degenerate manifold .",
    "hence the first order energies of the regularized delta function potential ( [ eqn : firstorder ] ) coincide with the first order energies of the bare delta function potential ( [ eqn : first_order_fermi ] ) . therefore , even though we showed that the bare delta function potential is in general not adequate , it serves as a valid first order approximation for the regularized delta function potential .    more generally , fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] suggests that the bare delta function potential may even approximate the regularized delta function potential beyond the first order perturbation theory , by including only a few more , but not too many , adjacent states .",
    "for example the bo potential energy curve @xmath60 obtained by including only states adjacent to the @xmath88 manifold , lies close to @xmath84 . here",
    "a more rigorous comparison between the gain in accuracy and the error accumulated when increasing the size of the basis set , would be desirable and should be carried out in the future .",
    "this would be especially useful as the regularized delta function potential can not be implemented in a numerical diagonalization procedure that relies on the basis functions @xmath79 which are regular at @xmath17 .",
    "we see this from ( [ eqn : matrixreg ] ) , which , in contrast to ( [ eqn : matrix ] ) , can not be converted into a system of linear equations for the coefficients @xmath89 because the sum has to be carried out before taking the differential .",
    "aspects of the numerical implementation of the fermi pseudopotential approach , relevant to the calculation of the bo potential energy curves of the ultralong - range rydberg molecules bound by pure @xmath0-wave scattering are delineated .",
    "it is shown that the bare delta pseudopotential leads to unphysical results that diverge with increasing basis set size in any diagonalization scheme .",
    "this behavior is described analytically .",
    "the convergent bo potential curves , that agree exactly with the results obtained within the quantum defect theory can be produced by employing a regularized delta function potential .",
    "although the bare delta function potential still yields the correct binding energies in the first order perturbation theory , the example of the @xmath27 molecule indicates that beyond the first order effects are not negligible . by including some of the neighboring rydberg basis states ,",
    "some of these corrections can be reproduced .",
    "however it remains to be seen how many additional states can rigorously be included in exact diagonalization schemes and whether the zero - range pseudopotential for the @xmath90-wave - interaction @xcite , will require similar regularization as well .",
