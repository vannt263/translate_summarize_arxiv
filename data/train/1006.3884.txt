    "a major focus of the study of strongly correlated electronic systems is the analysis of the competition between qualitatively distinct ground states and the associated quantum phase transitions ( qpt )  @xcite in low dimensions .",
    "a reason to concentrate on these matters stems from the hope that the criticality of the system at such qpt s possibly results in a universal description of their vicinity . in @xmath1 space - time dimensions ,",
    "the resulting relativistic quantum field theories which describe the zero - temperature transition between these quantum phases are in general strongly coupled and can be highly non - trivial  @xcite .    in one dimension ,",
    "the situation is much simpler since the quantum critical points in standard condensed matter systems are characterized by conformal field theories ( cft ) , which often admit a simple free - field representation in terms of free bosons or fermions . in this respect ,",
    "the bosonization approach has been very successful to investigate the physical properties of one - dimensional quantum phases  @xcite . within this approach",
    ", several conventional and exotic long - range ordered phases have been revealed over the years in two - leg ladder models  @xcite and carbon nanotube systems  @xcite at half - filling .",
    "two different classes of mott - insulating phases have been found at half - filling in these systems .",
    "a first class is two - fold degenerate corresponding to the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries such as the translation symmetry in charge density wave ( cdw ) and bond - ordering phases , or the time - reversal symmetry in d - density wave ( ddw ) phase .",
    "in contrast , the second class of mott - insulating phases is non - degenerate .",
    "a paradigmatic example of this class is the haldane phase of the spin-1 heisenberg chain  @xcite and of the two - leg spin ladder which breaks spontaneously a non - local z@xmath2 @xmath3 z@xmath2 discrete symmetry  @xcite .",
    "another striking particularity of many one - dimensional electronic systems is the existence of hidden duality symmetries , within the low - energy approach , which relate many of the competing orders to a conventional one like the cdw  @xcite .",
    "actually , a general duality approach has been introduced recently to describe the zero - temperature spin - gapped phases of one - dimensional ( 1d ) electronic systems away from half - filling  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we apply this approach to half - filled systems of four - component fermions and revisit the problem of competing orders in half - filled two - leg electronic ladders . in this particular case ,",
    "some of the duality symmetries already exist at the level of the lattice model , and have been first revealed in ref .  .",
    "in addition to these , as it will be seen , there are also interesting _ emergent duality symmetries _ which relate non - degenerate mott insulating phases to conventional order such as cdw . unlike the former ones , those dualities do not bear a local representation on the lattice .",
    "the starting point of the duality approach to competing orders is to identify the internal global symmetry group h of the lattice model . for two - leg electronic ladders , or more generally two - band models ,",
    "the building blocks of the model are four - component fermionic creation operators on each site @xmath4 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the leg or orbital index and @xmath7 denotes the spin-@xmath8 index .",

    "the two - orbital states are described in these systems by the ground state ( @xmath30s@xmath31 @xmath32 g ) and a long - lived excited state ( @xmath33p@xmath31 @xmath32 e ) .",
    "the almost perfect decoupling of the nuclear spin from the electronic angular momentum @xmath34 in the two @xmath35 states ( @xmath36 states ) makes the s - wave scattering lengths of the problem independent of the nuclear spin .",
    "the low - energy hamiltonian relevant to the @xmath28yb cold gas loaded into a 1d optical lattice then reads  @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the fermionic creation operator at site @xmath4 with the nuclear spin-@xmath8 index @xmath39 in the @xmath40 electronic states .",

    "model ( [ ytterbium ] ) is then directly equivalent to the generalized hund model ( [ ghundmodellattice ] ) with the correspondence : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "apart from this connection to cold fermions physics , one of the main interests of model ( [ ghundmodellattice ] ) stems from the fact that it contains a large variety of relevant models with extended continuous symmetries , some of which having appeared in different contexts .",
    "first of all , when @xmath45 , the continuous symmetry is promoted to u(1)@xmath14 @xmath3 su(2)@xmath15 @xmath3 su(2)@xmath16 , and one recovers the so - called spin - orbital model  @xcite . in absence of hund coupling ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath46 , the continuous symmetry group of model ( [ ghundmodellattice ] ) is u(1)@xmath14 @xmath3 u(1)@xmath16 @xmath3 so(4)@xmath15 where each chain has a separate su(2 ) spin - rotational symmetry .",

    "as it will be seen in section ii , at half - filling , many other highly symmetric lines can be identified .",
    "for instance , the line @xmath50 unifies spin and charge degrees of freedom with an extended u(1)@xmath16 @xmath3 so(5)@xmath51 continuous symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding model has been previously introduced by scalapino , zhang and hanke ( szh )  @xcite in connection to the so(5 ) theory which relates antiferromagnetism to d - wave superconductivity  @xcite .    in this paper",

    "these eight mott - insulating phases fall into two different classes . on the one hand ,",
    "the first class consists of four doubly degenerate phases which spontaneously break a discrete symmetry of the underlying lattice model . on the other hand , the second class contains four non - degenerate mott insulating phases .",
    "a first one is the rung - singlet ( rs ) phase where two spins on each rung lock into a singlet .",
    "a second non - degenerate phase is a rung - triplet ( rt ) phase where the spins now combine into a triplet and this phase is known to be adiabatically connected to the haldane phase of the spin-1 heisenberg chain  @xcite .",
    "finally , two other haldane - like phases are found : they are spin - singlet but involve two different pseudo - spin 1 operators which are respectively built from charge and orbital degrees of freedom . in the case of the charge pseudo - spin 1 operator , the resulting haldane charge ( hc ) phase has been found very recently in the context of 1d half - filled spin-@xmath0 cold fermions  @xcite .",
    "in addition to this duality approach , it will be shown , by means of a one - loop renormalization group ( rg ) approach and numerical simulations ( using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm  @xcite ) , that the zero - temperature phase diagram of model ( [ ghundmodellattice ] ) displays seven out of the eight expected insulating phases .",
    "we find it remarkable that model ( [ ghundmodellattice ] ) , that only has three independent coupling constants , turns out to have a rich phase diagram which includes the four non - degenerate mott insulating phases .",
    "finally , we will make contact with the eight mott - insulating phases found over the years in half - filled generalized two - leg ladders with a @xmath52 transverse hopping term  @xcite .",
    "the latter term breaks explicitly the u(1)@xmath16 symmetry but it is known that this symmetry is recovered at low - energy  @xcite .",
    "the relevant global symmetry group is still h and the same duality approach thus applies to that case . in this respect",
    ", we will connect the two families of eight fully gapped phases found for @xmath53 and for @xmath54 .",
    "in particular , it will be shown that the two problems are in fact connected by an emergent non - local duality symmetry .",
