    "pr - based intermetallic compounds have evolved as a topic of current interest among the condensed matter physicists as some of these compounds exhibit interesting physical properties .",
    "while in ce - compounds the relative strengths of the rkky and kondo interactions decide the ground state properties , in case of pr - compounds the ground state depends critically on the crystal electric field ( cef ) level scheme .",
    "for example , in pros@xmath2sb@xmath3 a small cef splitting energy of 0.7 mev and quadrupolar excitations lead to unconventional heavy - fermion superconductivity [ 1 - 3 ] .",

    "we found an antiferromagnetic ordering at 68 k in prrh@xmath0si@xmath0 which is anomalously high compared to the expected de - gennes - scaled transition temperature of 5.4 k @xcite .",
    "further , we decided to investigate prpd@xmath0si@xmath0 and prpt@xmath0si@xmath0 in view of the interesting features of cepd@xmath0si@xmath0 and cept@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "while cepd@xmath0si@xmath0 is a heavy - fermion antiferromagnet system which exhibits pressure induced superconductivity @xcite , cept@xmath0si@xmath0 is a kondo lattice non - fermi liquid system that does not order down to 60 mk @xcite .",

    "we report here our results of magnetization , electrical resistivity , and heat capacity studies of prpd@xmath0si@xmath0 and prpt@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "polycrystalline samples of prpd@xmath0si@xmath0 and prpt@xmath0si@xmath0 and their la - analogs were prepared by standard arc - melting on a water cooled copper hearth under an inert argon atmosphere starting with high purity ( 99.99% and above ) elements in stoichiometric ratio . to ensure a proper mixing of the constituents ,",
    "arc melted ingots were flipped and remelted several times .",
    "weight loss during the melting process was less than 0.5% .",
    "the samples were annealed at 1000 @xmath6c for one week to improve the sample quality .",

    "though all the peaks in x - ray diffraction pattern of prpd@xmath0si@xmath0 and prpt@xmath0si@xmath0 are well indexed , the scanning electron micrographs show the presence of impurity phase(s ) which we estimated to be less than 3% in prpd@xmath0si@xmath0 and about 6% in prpt@xmath0si@xmath0 .",

    "the magnetic susceptibility data of prpd@xmath0si@xmath0 are shown in figure 1 .",
    "magnetic susceptibility follows the curie - weiss behavior above 50 k. fitting the inverse susceptibility data to the expression 1/@xmath7 = ( @xmath8)/@xmath9 , we obtained an effective moment @xmath10 = 3.59 @xmath11 ( theoretically expected value for pr@xmath12 ions is 3.58 @xmath11 ) and a weiss temperature @xmath13 = - 4.2 k. the low temperature susceptibility data ( shown in the inset of figure 1 ) show a peak at 3.5 k. the position of the peak shifts towards lower temperatures with increasing field , thereby confirming the antiferromagnetic nature of the transition at 3.5 k. the isothermal magnetization data at 2 k ( figure 2 ) exhibits a very smooth metamagnetic - type transition at 4.8 t. the critical field for the metamagnetic transition is determined from the @xmath14 _ vs. _ @xmath15 plot ( inset of figure 2 ) .",
    "no saturation is observed upto b = 6.0 t.     the magnetic field dependence of magnetization of prpd@xmath0si@xmath0 at 2 and 10 k. the inset shows the derivative of magnetization data at 2 k.,width=377 ]     the magnetic contribution to the specific heat of prpd@xmath0si@xmath0 as a function of temperature in the temperature range 0.5 ",
    "52 k. the solid line represents the fit for equally degenerate two level schottky anomaly with a separation of 50 k. the inset shows the temperature dependence of magnetic entropy.,width=377 ]    figure 3 shows the magnetic contribution to the specific heat of prpd@xmath0si@xmath0 which we obtained after subtracting the lattice contribution assuming it to be roughly equal to that of the nonmagnetic analog lapd@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "the specific heat data of prpd@xmath0si@xmath0 exhibits a sharp @xmath16-type peak at 3 k which confirms the intrinsic nature of magnetic order in this compound .",
    "the magnetic entropy reaches a value close to @xmath17 (= 11.52 j / mole - k ) at 7.5 k , suggesting a quasi - quartet ground state .",
    "we also observe a pronounced schottky type anomaly with a broad maximum centered around 20 k which we attribute to the crystal field effect .",
    "the position of schottky peak suggests that the excited states lie about 50 k above the low lying cef states .",
    "the peak height of the schottky anomaly is consistent with equal degeneracy between the low lying states and the excited states , suggesting the presence of four cef levels close to 50 k. in a tetragonal symmetry one expects the cef levels of pr@xmath12 to split into five singlets and two doublets .",
    "thus in prpd@xmath0si@xmath0 , the temperature dependence of the entropy indicate a separation into four low lying levels ( either two doublets , or one doublet and two singlets , or four singlets ) separated by less than 10 k , four further levels around 50 k , and an upper singlet at much higher energy . since in rpd@xmath0si@xmath0",
    "the cef schemes seem to be determined by the higher order terms in the cef hamiltonian @xcite , a simple preliminary guess of the cef sheme of prpd@xmath0si@xmath0 can not be given .",
    "temperature dependence of electrical resistivity of prpd@xmath1si@xmath1 in the temperature range 2  300 k. the upper inset shows the low temperature resistivity data at different fields .",
    "the lower inset shows the magnetoresistance normalized to @xmath18 at b = 0.,width=415 ]    in the paramagnetic regime the electrical resistivity decreases almost linearly with decreasing temperature ( figure 4 ) and merge into a constant value of 5.5 @xmath19-cm below 10 k. the resistivity drops rapidly below the ordering temperature due to reduction of spin disorder scattering .",
    "the resistivity at 2 k , where @xmath18 is still decreasing with t , is 3.4 @xmath19-cm leading to a lower bound of @xmath20 15 for the residual resistivity ratio .",
    "this evidences a good quality of our polycrystalline sample .",
    "the upper inset of figure 4 shows the effect of a magnetic field on the resistivity .",
    "the resistivity anomaly related to the magnetic order smoothens out for b @xmath21 2 t. the magnetoresistance @xmath22/@xmath23 = [ @xmath23(@xmath15)-@xmath23(0)]/@xmath23(0 ) is shown in the lower inset of figure 4 . in the ordered state ( at 2 k ) the magnetoresistance initially increases with increasing field , peaks at 6 t and decreases for higher fields .",
    "such a behavior of the magnetoresistance is expected for an antiferromagnetic state . for t @xmath24 t@xmath25",
    ", an increasing magnetic field is first weakening the af - state , leading to an increase of spin scattering , but above the metamagnetic transition the formation of the field aligned state results in a decrease of spin scattering . in the paramagnetic state",
    "the magnetoresistane is always negative , since alignment of the moments in the external field reduces the spin scattering .",
    "thus , magnetic susceptibility , magnetization , specific heat and magnetoresistance data provide conclusive evidence for an antiferromagnetic state in prpd@xmath1si@xmath1 below 3.0 k.",
    "figure 5 shows the magnetic susceptibility data of prpt@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "no anomaly is observed in susceptibility data down to 2 k implying the absence of magnetic ordering in this compound . the paramagnetic susceptibility displays a curie - weiss character . from a fit of the inverse susceptibility data above 50 k to the expression 1/@xmath7",
    "= ( @xmath8)/@xmath9 we found the effective moment to be @xmath10 = 3.46 @xmath11 which is very close to the value of 3.58 @xmath11 expected for pr@xmath12 ions .",
    "the curie - weiss temperature @xmath13 = + 18.8 k indicates dominant ferromagnetic exchange in this compound .",
    "the isothermal magnetization curve is linear with field at 2 and 20 k which is consistent with a paramagnetic state down to 2 k in this compound .",
    "inverse magnetic susceptibility plot of prpt@xmath0si@xmath0 at a field of 1.0 t. the inset shows magnetization as a function of field at two different temperatures of 2 and 20 k.,width=377 ]     temperature dependence of magnetic contribution to the specific heat of prpt@xmath0si@xmath0 in the temperature range ( 2  50 k ) .",
    "the inset shows the temperature dependence of magnetic entropy.,width=377 ]    the magnetic contribution to the specific heat of prpt@xmath0si@xmath0 ( figure 6 ) was obtained by subtracting the specific heat data of lapt@xmath0si@xmath0 from that of prpt@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "no signature of magnetic or superconducting transition is observed in the specific heat data , which is consistent with the paramagnetic ground state inferred from the magnetic susceptibility data . from the low temperature specific heat data we estimate a @xmath26 value of @xmath20 3  mj / mole - k@xmath27 .",
    "such a low magnitude of specific heat at low t rules out the possibility of magnetic ordering even at lower temperature .",
    "a broad schottky type anomaly is observed in the magnetic part of the specific heat above 20 k. the upturn in the magnetic contribution ( c@xmath28 ) to the specific heat around 10 k could be reproduced with a first excited doublet separated from the singlet ground state by approximately 50 k. for the case of a singlet ground state and a doublet as first excited state one would expect a peak height of 6.2 j / mole - k in c@xmath28 .",
    "however , the experimentally observed value is 9.2 j / mole - k , clearly indicating that further higher lying states are also contributing .",
    "the large separation between the singlet ground state and the first excited state is responsible for the absence of magnetic order in prpt@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "usually the cef schemes of homologous rt@xmath1x@xmath1 compounds with different t- ( or x- ) elements of one row in the periodic table are quite similar , because neither the effective ionic charge at the ligands nor their distance to the r - atoms changes significantly .",
    "thus , in the present case , the strong differences between the cef schemes of prpd@xmath0si@xmath0 and prpt@xmath0si@xmath0 are very likely related to the loss of a mirror plane at the pr - site upon changing the crystal structure from the thcr@xmath1si@xmath1 to the cabe@xmath1ge@xmath1 type , although both structure types are closely related .",
    "this difference in the structures is likely also responsible for the change from dominant antiferromagnetic exchange in the pd - based compound to dominant ferromagnetic exchange in the pt - based compound .",
    "we have investigated magnetic properties of prpd@xmath0si@xmath0 and prpt@xmath0si@xmath0 . from a detailed measurements of magnetization , specific heat , electrical resistivity and magnetoresistance we have established antiferromagnetic ordering in prpd@xmath0si@xmath0 below 3 k. below t@xmath25 this compound also exhibits field induced metamagnetic transition and large magnetoresistance ( 20% ) at a magnetic field of 6 tesla . in contrast ,",
    "no magnetic order is observed in prpt@xmath0si@xmath0 down to 2 k. we attribute this paramagnetic ground state in prpt@xmath0si@xmath0 to the cef scheme with a singlet ground state and well separated first excited state located around 50 k. the pronounced differences between prpd@xmath0si@xmath0 and prpt@xmath0si@xmath0 are attributed to the loss of a mirror plane upon changing the crystal structure from the thcr@xmath1si@xmath1 to the cabe@xmath1ge@xmath1 type .",
    "further investigations are needed to determine the exact magnetic structure of prpd@xmath0si@xmath0 and the crystal field level schemes in these two compounds ."
