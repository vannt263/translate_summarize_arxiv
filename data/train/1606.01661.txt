    "an important question in the study of plasmas is to understand the fundamental physics involved in magnetic reconnection .",
    "magnetic reconnection processes can critically depend on a variety of length and time scales , for example on lengths of the order of the larmor orbits and below that of the mean free path ( @xcite ) .",
    "in such situations a collisionless kinetic theory could be necessary to capture all of the relevant physics , and as such an understanding of the differences between using mhd , two - fluid , hybrid , vlasov and other approaches is of paramount importance , for example see @xcite for discussions of this problem in the context of one - dimensional ( 1-d ) current sheets : the ` gem ' and ` newton ' challenges .",
    "current sheet equilibria are frequently considered to be the initial state of wave processes , instabilities , reconnection and various dynamical phenomena in laboratory , space and astrophysical plasmas , in theory and observation ; see for example @xcite . in particular ,",
    "force - free current sheets are relevant for the solar corona ( @xcite ) , jupiter s magnetotail ( @xcite ) , the earth s magnetotail ( @xcite ) and the earth s magnetopause ( @xcite ) .",
    "further relevant theoretical works on distribution functions ( dfs ) for ( nonlinear ) force - free current sheets are , for example , @xcite .    in the absence of an exact collisionless kinetic equilibrium solution",
    ", one has to use non - equilibrium dfs to start kinetic simulations , without knowing how far from the true equilibrium df they are . in such cases ,",
    "non - equilibrium ` flow - shifted ' maxwellian distributions are frequently used ( see @xcite for examples ) . using the df found in @xcite ,",
    "the first fully kinetic simulations of collisionless reconnection with an initial condition that is an exact vlasov solution for a nonlinear force - free field was conducted by @xcite .",
    "motivated by these and other considerations , this paper presents results on the theory and application of a method that allows the calculation of collisionless kinetic plasma equilibria .",
    "the method is specifically designed to solve the problem of finding quasineutral collisionless equilibrium dfs , @xmath1 , for a given macroscopic plasma equilibrium .    as intimated above , 1-d cartesian coordinates",
    "are very frequently used in the study of waves , instabilities and reconnection ( see @xcite for example ) . in this work , @xmath2 is taken to be the spatial coordinate on which the system depends .",
    "thus the hamiltonian , @xmath3 , and two of the canonical momenta @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath6 are conserved .",
    "the particle species is denoted by @xmath7 , with @xmath8 the charge , @xmath9 the velocity and @xmath10 the scalar potential . the vector potential is taken to be @xmath11 , such that @xmath12 .",
    "the macroscopic force balance is then given by @xmath13 see e.g. @xcite , with @xmath14 the current density , @xmath15 the magnetic permeability _ in vacuo _ and @xmath16 the @xmath17 component of the pressure tensor @xmath18 the particle velocity relative to the bulk is given by @xmath19 , for @xmath20 the @xmath21 component of the bulk velocity of particle species @xmath7 .",
    "a collisionless equilibrium df is a solution of the steady - state vlasov equation .",
    "a method frequently used to solve vlasov s equation is to write @xmath1 as a function of a subset of the constants of motion ( jeans theorem ) ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "this paper considers collisionless plasmas described by dfs of the form @xmath22 with @xmath23 the unknown deviation from a maxwellian distribution , parameterised by the thermal velocity @xmath24 of particle species @xmath7 .",
    "this form is chosen for the df for practical mathematical reasons ( integrability ) and to be readily compared to the maxwellian distribution function when @xmath25 .",
    "note that for dfs of the form in equation ( [ eq : f_form ] ) , @xmath26 , since @xmath1 is an even function of @xmath27 .",
    "the species - dependent parameter @xmath28 is the thermal beta , with @xmath29 a normalisation parameter that does not necessarily represent the number density .",
    "the combination of quasineutrality ( @xmath30 ) and a df of the form in equation ( [ eq : f_form ] ) results in a scalar potential that is implicitly defined as a function of the vector potential , e.g. @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the number densities of the ions and electrons respectively , and @xmath34 is the elementary charge . in this work ,",
    "parameters are chosen such that @xmath35 as functions over @xmath36 space , and so ` strict neutrality ' is satisfied , implying @xmath37 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that this form of df , together with strict neutrality , implies that the relevant component of the pressure tensor , @xmath38 , is a 2-d integral transform of the unknown function @xmath23 , given by @xmath39 this equation defines the inverse problem at hand , viz . ` for a given macroscopic equilibrium characterised by @xmath40 , can we invert the transform to solve for the unknown function @xmath23 ? '",
    "note that the current densities @xmath41 are themselves related to the pressure according to @xmath42 see @xcite for example .",
    "the above equation demonstrates that to reproduce a specific magnetic field , the @xmath38 function must be compatible .",
    "for example , in the case of a _ force - free field _ , there is a simple procedure one can follow to calculate an expression for @xmath40 ( for details see section 3 ) .    in @xcite ,",
    "hermite polynomials are used to solve the vlasov - maxwell ( vm ) system for the case of ` stationary waves ' in a manner like that to be described in this paper .",
    "these correspond not to vlasov equilibria , but rather to nonlinear waves that are stationary in the wave frame .    in @xcite ,",
    "two methods are presented for the solution of the inverse problem with neutral vm equilibria .",
    "these two methods are inversion by fourier transforms and  once again  expansion over hermite polynomials respectively .",
    "first impressions suggest that fourier transforms do seem ideally suited to the task , since the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : channell ] ) allows the convolution theorem to be applied .",
    "the fourier transform method is used in @xcite and @xcite for example .",
    "however , when either the fourier or inverse fourier transform can not be calculated , this method clearly fails to be of use .",
    "the method presented in this paper should be seen as a rigorous extension / generalisation of the hermite polynomial method used by abraham - shrauner and channell . as such",
    "it is complementary to the fourier transform method .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 contains the mathematical details of the solution of the inverse problem defined in the introduction .",
    "first , a formal solution is derived in subsection [ sec : formal ] , by using known methods of inverting weierstrass transforms with possibly infinite series of hermite polynomials . for the formal solution to meaningfully describe a df however , these series must be convergent , positive and bounded . a sufficient condition for convergence that places a restriction on the pressure tensor",
    "is obtained in subsection [ sec : convergence ] . in subsection",
    "[ sec : non - neg ] we argue that for an appropriate pressure function , there always exists a positive df , for a sufficiently magnetised plasma .",
    "we include some technical calculations in appendix b that support the positivity argument , including proofs for a certain class of function .    in section 3 .",
    "we present non - trivial examples to demonstrate the application of the inversion method to a recently derived force - free df , @xcite , as well as to dfs that correspond to the same magnetic field , but in a different gauge .",
    "this work is motivated by numerical reasons , and should allow easier calculation and visualisation of the dfs . in appendix",
    "a we present the full details of the calculations that verify that these dfs satisfy the convergence criteria derived in subsection [ sec : convergence ] , and that as a result the dfs are bounded . in section [ sec : channell ] we consider the use of the method for a non - force - free magnetic field , considered by @xcite using fourier transforms .",
    "this calculation is included to demonstrate the relationship between the fourier transform and hermite polynomial inversion methods .",
    "to make mathematical progress , we make the assumption of either ` summative ' or ` multiplicative ' separability , i.e. that @xmath40 is of the form @xmath43 the components of the pressure , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , are dimensionless .",
    "these assumptions are commensurate with @xmath46 respectively , and allow separation of variables according to @xmath47 the separation constant is set to unity in the case of multiplicative separability , and zero in the case of additive separability , without loss of generality .",
    "the components of the pressure are now represented by 1-d integral transforms of the unknown parts of the df .",
    "the weierstrass transform , @xmath48 of @xmath49 , is defined by @xmath50:x=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4{\\pi}}}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\ , { \\rm e}^{-(x - y)^2/4}\\,\\phi(y)\\,dy,\\label{eq : weier}\\ ] ]",
    "see @xcite for example .",
    "this is also known as the gauss transform , gauss - weiertrass transform and the hille transform @xcite . as the green s function solution to the heat / diffusion equation",
    ", @xmath48 represents the temperature / density profile of an infinite rod one second after it was @xmath51 , see @xcite , implying that the weierstrass transform of a positive function is itself a positive function .",
    "@xmath52 and @xmath53 are expressed as weierstrass transforms of @xmath54 and @xmath55 in equations ( [ eq : p1tog1 ] ) and ( [ eq : p2tog2 ] ) respectively , give or take some constant factors .",
    "formally , the operator for the inverse transform is @xmath56 , with d the differential operator and the exponential suitably interpreted , see @xcite for two different interpretations of this operator . we should mention that one of the existing nonlinear force - free vm equilibria known @xcite is based on an eigenfunction of the weierstrass transform @xcite .",
    "perhaps a more computationally ` practical ' method employs hermite polynomials , see @xcite .",
    "the weierstrass transform of the @xmath57 hermite polynomial @xmath58 is @xmath59 .",
    "hence if one knows the coefficients of the maclaurin expansion of @xmath48 in equation ( [ eq : weier ] ) , @xmath60 then the weierstrass transform can immediately be inverted to obtain the formal expansion @xmath61 for this method to be useful in our problem , the pressure function must have a maclaurin expansion that is convergent over all @xmath36 space .",
    "then , its coefficients of expansion must ` allow ' the hermite series to converge .",
    "questions regarding the positivity and convergence of formal solutions represented by infinite series of hermite polynomials were raised by @xcite and @xcite respectively , and the same questions arise in the context of the problems in this paper . for some other examples of applications of hermite polynomials to collisionless and weakly collisional plasmas ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we also remark that the use of hermite polynomials in kinetic theory dates back , at least , to @xcite in the study of rarefied collisional gases .",
    "the following discussion applies to pressure functions of both summative and multiplicative form , with maclaurin expansion representations ( convergent over all @xmath36 space ) given by @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 the characteristic magnetic field strength and spatial scale respectively . in line with",
    "the discussion on inversion of the weierstrass transform in subsection [ sec : weierstrass ] , we solve for @xmath23 functions represented by the following expansions @xmath65 with currently unknown species - dependent coefficients @xmath66 and @xmath67 . we can not simply ` read off ' the coefficients of expansion as in ( [ eq : inverseweier ] ) , since our integral equations are not quite in the ` perfect form ' of ( [ eq : weier ] ) .",
    "upon computing the integrals of equations ( [ eq : p1tog1 ] ) and ( [ eq : p2tog2 ] ) with the above expansions for @xmath23 , we have @xmath68 this result appears species dependent . however , to ensure neutrality ( @xmath69 ) - as in @xcite - we have to fix the pressure function to be species independent .",
    "it clearly must also match with the pressure function that maintains equilibrium with the prescribed magnetic field .",
    "the conditions derived here are critical for making a link between the macroscopic description of the equilibrium structure with the microscopic one of particles .",
    "these requirements imply by the matching of equations ( [ eq : pmacro ] ) and ( [ eq : pmicro ] ) that @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the species - dependent magnetisation parameter , @xmath73 , see @xcite for example , is defined by @xmath74 it is the ratio of the thermal larmor radius , @xmath75 , to the characteristic length scale of the system , @xmath64 .",
    "the gyrofrequency of particle species @xmath7 is @xmath76 .",
    "the magnetisation parameter is also known as the fundamental ordering parameter in gyrokinetic theory ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "( in particle orbit theory , @xmath77 implies that a guiding centre approximation will be applicable for that species , see @xcite . )      here we find a sufficient condition that , when satisfied , guarantees that the hermite series representations in ( [ eq : gform1 ] ) and ( [ eq : gform2 ] ) converge .",
    "this provides some answers to questions on the convergence of hermite polynomial representations of vlasov equilibria dating back to @xcite .",
    "[ thm : hermiteconvergence ] consider a maclaurin expansion of the form @xmath78 that is convergent for all @xmath79 .",
    "then for @xmath80 the function @xmath81 , calculated in the inverse problem defined by the association @xmath82 of the form @xmath83 converges for all @xmath84 , provided @xmath85 in the case of a series composed of both even- and odd - order terms , or @xmath86 in the case of a series composed only of even- , or odd - order terms , respectively .    for a series composed of even- and odd - order terms",
    ", we have that @xmath87 an upper bound on hermite polynomials ( see e.g. @xcite ) is provided by the identity @xmath88 this upper bound implies @xmath89 working on the level of the series composed of upper bounds , the ratio test clearly requires @xmath90 for a given @xmath91 .",
    "then , the comparison / squeeze test implies that if the condition of equation ( [ eq : criterion ] ) is satisfied , that since the series composed of upper bounds will converge , so must @xmath92 .",

    ", we consider the positivity of the hermite series representation of @xmath23  given by equations ( [ eq : gform1 ] ) and ( [ eq : gform2 ] )  and hence positivity of the df .",
    "this provides some answers to questions on the positivity of df representation by hermite polynomials dating back to @xcite , and also raised by @xcite .    for an example of a @xmath94 function that is not necessarily always positive despite the pressure function being positive , consider a pressure function ( e.g. from @xcite ) that is quadratic in the vector potential . in our notation ,",
    "the pressure function considered by channell is @xmath95 the resultant @xmath23 function is of the form @xmath96+\\frac{1}{2}\\left[a_0+a_2\\left(\\frac{\\delta_s}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2h_2\\left(\\frac{p_{ys}}{\\sqrt{2}m_{s}v_{th , s}}\\right)\\right].\\ ] ] once these hermite polynomials are expanded , by substituting @xmath97 we see that positivity of @xmath94 is  for given values of @xmath98 and @xmath99  contingent on the size of @xmath73 , @xmath100 however , there is not necessarily anything ` special ' about the point @xmath101 , as compared to other points in momentum - space .",
    "for example , consideration of the pressure function @xmath102 gives a @xmath94 function that can , for given values of @xmath103 and for @xmath73 sufficiently large , be positive at @xmath104 , and negative at some other points .",
    "it is worth considering how a @xmath23 function that is negative for some @xmath84 can transform in the manner of ( [ eq : p1tog1 ] ) and ( [ eq : p2tog2 ] ) to give a positive @xmath105 .",
    "one might expect that for certain values of @xmath79 such that the gaussian @xmath106 is centred on the region in @xmath107 space for which @xmath94 is negative , that a negative value of @xmath105 could be the result .    essentially , the gaussian will only ` successfully sample ' a negative region of @xmath94 to give a negative value of @xmath105 if the gaussian is narrow enough  for a given value of @xmath108  to ` resolve ' a negative patch of @xmath94 . in other words ,",
    "if the gaussian is too broad , it wo nt ` see ' the negative patches of @xmath94 , and hence @xmath105 will be positive . hence the non - negativity of @xmath105 is a restriction on the possible shape of @xmath94 , and how that shape must scale with @xmath108 .",
    "it is a short algebraic exercise to rewrite ( [ eq : sample ] ) in the form @xmath109 by using the following associations @xmath110 and with @xmath111 we shall assume that the right - hand side of ( [ eq : gnorm ] ) represents a differentiable function . note that the gaussian in ( [ eq : newsample ] ) is of fixed width @xmath112 ( defined at @xmath113 ) , in contrast to the gaussian of variable width defined in ( [ eq : sample ] ) .",
    "if the hermite series satisfies the condition in theorem 1 then it is convergent , so ( [ eq : hermbound ] ) gives @xmath114 for some finite and positive @xmath64 , determined by the sum of the ( possibly infinite ) series .",
    "note that these bounds automatically imply integrability of @xmath115 since , for some finite @xmath116 , we have that @xmath117 implies integrability , which is a less strict condition .",
    "this can be seen from ( [ eq : newsample ] ) .",
    "the bounds on @xmath118 given above demonstrate that @xmath118 can not tend to infinity for finite @xmath119 .",
    "hence it can only reach @xmath120 as @xmath121 .",
    "we argue however that the positivity of the pressure prevents the possibility of @xmath118 being without a finite lower bound .",
    "the heuristic reasoning is as follows : the expression on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : newsample ] ) treats  in the language of the heat / diffusion equation ",
    "the @xmath122 function as the initial condition for a temperature / density distribution on an infinite 1-d line , and the left - hand side represents the distribution at some finite time later on ( half a second later , see @xcite ) .",
    "were @xmath118 to be unbounded from below , this would imply for our problem that a smooth ` temperature / density ' distribution that is initially unbounded from below could , in some finite time , evolve into a distribution that has a positive and finite lower bound .",
    "this seems entirely unphysical since this would imply that an infinite negative ` sink ' of heat / mass would somehow be ` filled in ' above zero level in a finite time . in appendix [ app : nonneg ] we give some more technical mathematical arguments to support our claim that this is not possible , including proofs for a certain class of @xmath118 functions .",
    "if @xmath118 ( and hence @xmath23 ) is indeed bounded below then that means that one can always add a finite constant to @xmath94 to make it positive , should the lower bound be known .",
    "however this constant contribution would directly correspond to raising the pressure ( through the zeroth order maclaurin coefficient @xmath98 ) .",
    "but if we wish to consider a pressure function that is ` fixed ' , then we have a fixed @xmath98 , and so it is not immediately obvious whether or not we can obtain a @xmath94 that is positive over all momentum space .",
    "we have already seen some examples in the discussion above for which the sign of @xmath94 depended on the value of @xmath73 .",
    "consider @xmath118 evaluated at some particular value of @xmath119 .",
    "we see from ( [ eq : gnorm ] ) that positivity requires @xmath123 for @xmath124 finite constants .",
    "we also know that @xmath125 since @xmath126 , i.e. the pressure is positive .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that positivity of @xmath94 places some restriction on possible values of @xmath73 .",
    "let us now suppose that for a given value of @xmath73 , that there exists some regions in @xmath119 space where @xmath127 .",
    "our claim that @xmath118 has a finite lower bound , combined with the expression in ( [ eq : gnorm ] ) implies that the @xmath118 function is bounded below by a finite constant of the form @xmath128 , with @xmath129 and finite . by letting @xmath130 we see that @xmath118 will converge uniformly to @xmath98 , with @xmath131 hence",
    ", there must have existed some critical value of @xmath132 such that for all @xmath133 we have positivity of @xmath118 .",
    "note that if the negative patches of @xmath118 do not exist for any @xmath73 , then trivially @xmath134 as a special case .",
    "+ to summarise , we claim ",
    "provided @xmath94 is differentiable and convergent  that for values of the magnetisation parameter @xmath73 less than some critical value @xmath135 , according to @xmath136 , @xmath94 is positive for any positive pressure function .",
    "force - free fields are those whose current density is everywhere parallel to the magnetic field , giving zero lorentz force @xmath137 the nature of @xmath138 determines three distinct classes .",
    "potential fields have @xmath139 , linear force - free fields have @xmath140 and nonlinear force - free fields have @xmath141 .",
    "one - dimensional force - free fields can be represented without loss of generality by @xmath142 this leads on to a pressure balance of the form @xmath143 as demonstrated in @xcite , the assumption of summative separability ( the first option in equation ( [ eq : pform ] ) ) determines the components of the pressure according to @xmath144 these expressions can now be used as the left - hand side of the integral equations ( [ eq : p1tog1 ] ) and ( [ eq : p2tog2 ] ) , and one could attempt to invert the weierstrass transforms .",
    "this method was used in @xcite to derive a summative pressure for the ` force - free harris sheet ' ( ffhs ) magnetic field , and derive the corresponding df .    as shown in @xcite , ampre s law admits an infinite number of pressure functions for the same force - free equilibrium .",
    "once a @xmath40 with the correct properties has been found one can define another pressure function giving rise to the same current density by using the nonlinear transformation @xmath145 here any differentiable , non - constant function @xmath146 can be used , such that the right - hand side is positive , with @xmath147 the pressure , @xmath38 , evaluated at the force - free vector potential @xmath148 .    obviously , even if the integral equation ( [ eq : channell ] ) can be solved for the original function @xmath149 it is by no means clear that this is possible for the transformed function @xmath150 . usually one would expect that solving ( [ eq : channell ] ) for @xmath23 is much more difficult after the transformation to @xmath150 .",

    "this is of particular interest because it allows us to freely choose the plasma beta , @xmath154 , the ratio between the thermal and magnetic energy densities ( in our system the gas / plasma pressure and the magnetic pressure respectively ) @xmath155      a free choice of the plasma beta is not possible in the summative _ harrison - neukirch _ equilibrium df since that equilibrium has a lower bound of unity for the plasma beta .",
    "note that the @xmath38 used in that work is of a ` summative form ' @xmath156 in fact it seems to be a feature generally observed that for pressure tensors ( that correspond to force - free fields ) constructed in this manner ( @xcite ) the plasma - beta is necessarily bounded below by unity .",
    "a recent paper , @xcite , used the pressure transformation techniques described above , resulting in a pressure tensor of ` multiplicative form ' @xmath157 to construct a df with any @xmath154 .",

    "the ` problem terms ' are those that depend on @xmath4 .",
    "the specific problem is that the @xmath159 function used in previous papers is neither even nor odd as a function of @xmath2 , @xmath160 and as a result the range of @xmath4 for which it is necessary to numerically calculate a convergent df can be obstructive , say over a symmetric range in velocity space .",
    "specifically , it is challenging to attain numerical convergence for sums over hermite polynomials when the modulus of the argument is large .",
    "when @xmath159 is neither even nor odd , then @xmath161 can take on larger than ` necessary ' values for a given @xmath162 .",

    "this value for @xmath154 is substantially lower than the value used in @xcite , which had @xmath158 .",
    "the ability to go down to lower values of the plasma beta is due to the re - gauging process as explained in subsection [ subsec : regauge ] .",
    "the plots that we show are intended to demonstrate progress in the numerical evaluation of low - beta dfs for nonlinear force - free fields , and as a proof of principle . note that whilst the re - gauging process has allowed us to attain numerical convergence for low values of @xmath154 , the df is proven to be convergent for all values of the relevant parameters .",
    "the value of @xmath73 is chosen such that @xmath196 , since as explained in @xcite , attaining convergence numerically has not been easy for values of @xmath197 when @xmath198 .",
    "initial investigations of the shape of the variation of the df in the @xmath162 and @xmath199 directions indicate that the df seems to have a gaussian profile , as in the dfs analysed in @xcite . hence , as in that work , we shall compare the dfs calculated in this work to ` flow - shifted ' maxwellians , @xmath200 , \\label{eq : maxshift}\\ ] ] in order to measure the actual difference between the vlasov equilibrium @xmath1 , and the maxwellian @xmath201 .",
    "the above distribution reproduces identical zeroth- and first - order moments ( as functions of @xmath2 ) as the df defined by equation ( [ eq : gammaanwt ] ) , namely @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",

    "flow - shifted ' maxwellians in kinetic simulations , see @xcite .    in figures ( [ fig:1a]-[fig:1e ] ) and ( [ fig:2a]-[fig:2e ] ) we give contour plots in @xmath204 space of the ` raw ' difference between the dfs defined by equation ( [ eq : gammaanwt ] ) and ( [ eq : maxshift ] ) .",
    "these figures bear close resemblance to those presented in @xcite .",
    "specifically , we see ` shallower ' peaks for the exact vlasov solution , @xmath1 , than for @xmath201 .",
    "there is also a clear anisotropic effect in that @xmath1 falls of more quickly in the @xmath162 direction than the @xmath199 direction as compared to @xmath201 .",
    "note that whilst the raw differences plotted in these figures may not seem substantial , they can in fact be substantial as a proportion of @xmath201 , and even of the order of the magnitude of @xmath201 . as a demonstration of this fact we present plots in figures ( [ fig:3a]-[fig:3e ] ) and ( [ fig:4a]-[fig:4e ] ) of the quantity defined by @xmath205 for line cuts through @xmath206 and @xmath207 respectively , for the ions .",
    "as suggested by the contour plots , @xmath208 takes on significantly larger values in the @xmath199 direction , indicating that the tail of @xmath209 falls off less quickly than @xmath210 in @xmath199 than in @xmath162 .",
    "we are yet to observe multiple peaks in the multiplicative dfs for the ffhs , derived herein and in @xcite .",
    "however , the summative harrison - neukirch equilibria ( @xcite ) could develop multiple maxima for sufficiently large values of the magnitude of the drift velocities . for the df derived in this paper , and as in @xcite , the ` amplitude ' of the drift velocity profile across the current sheet",
    "is given by @xmath211 where @xmath212 represents the maximum value of the drift velocities .",
    "as a result , large values of the drift velocity correspond to large values of @xmath213 , and these are exactly the regimes for which we are struggling to attain numerical convergence .",
    "this theory suggests that we may not be seeing dfs with multiple maxima because we are not in the appropriate parameter space .",
    "the work in this paper was initially motivated by attempts to find dfs for force - free equilibria ( @xmath214 ) .",
    "however there is nothing in the formal solution method for the inverse problem @xmath215 that requires the magnetic field under consideration to be force - free . here",
    "we give an example of the use of the solution method to a pressure function that was first discussed in @xcite . in that paper ,",
    "channell actually solved the inverse problem by the fourier transform method , and showed that the solution was valid given certain restrictions on the parameters .",
    "we tackle the problem via the hermite polynomial method , and find that for the resultant df to be convergent , we require exactly the same restrictions as channell .",
    "this parity between the validity of the two methods is reassuring , and implies that the necessary restrictions on the parameters are in a sense ` method independent ' , and are the result of fundamental restrictions on the inversion of weierstrass transformations .",
    "the magnetic field considered by channell is of the form @xmath216 with a pressure function @xmath217 for @xmath218 and @xmath219 dimensionless .",
    "note that the @xmath220 used by channell has dimensions equivalent to @xmath221 .",
    "note also that since the pressure is not constant , @xmath152 does not represent the value of the pressure , rather it is just some reference value .",
    "we can now write the details of the inversion .",
    "the equation we must solve , for a df given by @xmath222 is @xmath223 we can immediately formally invert this equation as per the methods described in this paper , given the macluarin expansion of the pressure @xmath224 to give @xmath225 let us turn to the question of convergence .",
    "theorem 1 states that if @xmath226 then the @xmath23 function is convergent .",
    "this is readily seen to imply that if @xmath220 satisfies @xmath227 then the hermite series representation for @xmath23 is convergent .",
    "this condition is exactly equivalent to the one derived by channell ( equation ( 28 ) in the paper ) .",
    "note that now that we have established convergence for particular @xmath220 , then boundedness results follow as per other results given in this paper , detailed in appendix a. one more question remains , namely how does the @xmath23 function derived compare to the gaussian @xmath228 function derived by channell @xmath229 ( in our notation ) using the method of fourier transforms ?",
    "in fact , one can see by setting @xmath230 in mehler s hermite polynomial formula ( @xcite ) @xmath231=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\rho ^n}{2^n n ! } h_n(x)h_n(y )   , \\ ] ] and using @xmath232 ( see @xcite for example ) we see that the hermite series represents a gaussian function in the range @xmath233 .",
    "this is equivalent to the condition derived above for convergence , @xmath234 .",
    "hence , we have shown that for this specific example - solvable by using both hermite polynomials and fourier transforms - the two methods used to solve the inverse problem give equivalent functions with equivalent ranges of validity .",
    "the primary result of this paper is the rigorous generalisation of a solution method that exactly solves the ` inverse problem ' in 1-d collisionless equilibria , for a certain class of equilibria .",
    "specifically , given a pressure function , @xmath40 , of a separable form , neutral equilibrium distribution functions can be calculated that reproduce the prescribed macroscopic equilibrium , provided @xmath38 satisfies certain conditions on the coefficients of its ( convergent ) maclaurin expansion , and is itself positive .",
    "in particular , for force - free magnetic fields , there is an algorithmic path taking the magnetic field , @xmath235 , as input , and giving the distribution function @xmath1 as output .",
    "the distribution function has the form of a maxwellian modified by a function @xmath94 , itself represented by ",
    "possibly infinite  series of hermite polynomials in the canonical momenta .",
    "it is crucial that these series are convergent and positive for the solution to be meaningful .",
    "a sufficient condition was derived for convergence of the distribution function by elementary means , namely the ratio test , with the result a restriction on the rate of decay of the maclaurin coefficients of @xmath38 .",
    "we also argue that for such a pressure function that is also positive , that the hermite series representation of the modification to the maxwellian is positive , for sufficiently low values of the magnetisation parameter , i.e. lower than some critical value .",
    "this was actually proven for a certain class of @xmath94 functions , and differentiability of @xmath94 was assumed .",
    "it would be interesting in the future to investigate whether this critical value of the magnetisation parameter can be determined .",
    "note that whilst we have not yet determined the critical value , we have not yet observed negative distribution functions for the pressure functions and parameter ranges studied .",
    "examples of the use of the hermite polynomial method are given for dfs that correspond to the force - free harris sheet , including calculations for a df with a different gauge to that considered previously , motivated by numerical reasons .",
    "we have presented some plots of a comparison between the re - gauged dfs and shifted maxwellian functions , as a proof of principle , namely that numerical convergence for values of @xmath154 lower than previously reached , can now be attained ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "verification of the analytical properties of convergence and boundedness of the distribution functions written as infinite sums over hermite polynomials are given in appendix a. note that the verification of these distribution functions is rather involved due to the complex nature of the specific maclaurin expansions that we consider , and is simpler for more ` straightforward ' expansions , e.g. for the example considered in section [ sec : channell ] .",
    "we have demonstrated the application of the solution method presented in this paper to the force - free harris sheet magnetic field .",
    "however , potential uses go beyond this example , including magnetic fields that are not force - free . to this end",
    "we consider a non - force - free example in section [ sec : channell ] .",
    "this particular example already has a known solution and range of validity in parameter space , obtained by a fourier transform method in @xcite .",
    "we obtain a solution with an alternate representation using the hermite polynomial method .",
    "the hermite series obtained is shown to be equivalent to the representation obtained by channell , and to have the exact same range of validity in parameter space .",
    "it is not clear if this equivalence between solutions obtained by the two different methods is true in general .",
    "our problem is somewhat analagous to the heat / diffusion equation , and in that ` language ' the question of the equivalence of solutions is related to the ` backwards uniqueness of the heat equation ' ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the degree of similarity between our problem and the one described by evans , and its implications , are left for future investigations .    also , whilst we have assumed that the pressure is separable ( either summatively or multiplicatively ) , the method should be adaptable in the ` obvious way ' for pressures that are a combination of the two types .",
    "interesting further work would be to see if the method can be adapted to work for pressure functions that are non - separable , i.e. of the form @xmath236 this would be pertinent for pressure tensors transformed in such a way that they are no longer separable .    other future work could involve an in - depth parameter study of the new re - gauged multiplicative distribution function for the ffhs , with an analysis of how far the exact equilibrium distribution function differs from an appropriately flow - shifted maxwellian , frequently used in fully kinetic simulations for reconnection studies .",
    "in particular it would be interesting to see how much the distribution functions differ from flow - shifted maxwellians as the set of parameters @xmath237 are varied across a wide range .",
    "preliminary numerical investigations verify that plotting distribution functions for the ffhs with a lower @xmath154 than previously achieved , namely @xmath0 rather than @xmath158 , has been made possible by the theoretical developments in this paper .",
    "we have not yet observed multiple maxima for the distribution functions , but do see significant deviations from maxwellian distributions , and an anisotropy in velocity space .",

    "we shall first verify the convergence of @xmath55 ( expanded over @xmath238 in equation ( [ eq : result ] ) ) using the convergence condition from subsection [ sec : convergence ] , and then verify convergence of @xmath54 by comparison with @xmath55 . as theorem 1 states , we can verify convergence of @xmath55 provided @xmath239 explicit expansion of the exponentiated exponential series by ` twice ' using maclaurin series ( as opposed to the cbp formulation of equation ( [ eq : bell ] ) ) gives @xmath240 and so @xmath241 the @xmath242th ` partial sum ' of this fraction has the form @xmath243 with @xmath244 , where we write @xmath245 to mean @xmath246 and @xmath247 are bounded away from @xmath101 .",

    "hence , each term in our series for @xmath272 is bounded above by a series known to converge for all @xmath73 according to @xmath273 so by the comparison test , we can now say that @xmath274 is a convergent series .",
    "hence the representation of the df in equation ( [ eq : result ] ) is convergent .",
    "since @xmath54 and @xmath55 are known to be convergent , we know that for a given @xmath2 , the df is bounded in momentum space by @xmath275 where @xmath276 and @xmath277 are finite constants .",

    "this clearly goes to zero for sufficiently large @xmath161 , @xmath278 and is without singularity .",
    "we conclude that the distribution is bounded / normalisable .",
    "this df has the exact same coefficients for the @xmath5-dependent hermite polynomials as that discussed above .",
    "and so we need not verify convergence for that series . and in fact , all that has changed in the analysis of the coefficients for the @xmath4-dependent sum is that we now have to consider the maclaurin coefficients of @xmath279 as opposed to @xmath280 .",
    "these maclaurin coefficients both have the same factorial dependence and as such the convergence of the one df implies the convergence of the other .",
    "the boundedness argument is exactly analogous to that made above for the df in original gauge , and need not be repeated here .",
    "here we give some technical remarks that support our claim that @xmath118 ( and hence @xmath94 ) is bounded below , using an argument by contradiction .",
    "* case 1 : there will be some @xmath281 such that @xmath282 for all @xmath283 . this is a trivial statement if @xmath118 has only a finite number of stationary points , whereas in the case of an infinite number of stationary points , all maxima of @xmath118 for @xmath283 must be ` away ' from zero by a finite amount .",
    "* case 2 : in this case the ( infinite number of ) maxima either can rise above zero , or tend to zero from below in a limiting fashion .",

    "if we then substitute the @xmath284 function for @xmath118 in ( [ eq : newsample ] ) the integrals give combinations of error functions , from which it is seen that one obtains a negative result for sufficiently large @xmath288 .",
    "this is a contradiction since the left - hand side of ( [ eq : newsample ] ) is positive for all @xmath288 .",
    "hence we can discount the @xmath122 functions of the variety described in case 1 , as we have a contradiction .",
    "case 2 is less simple to treat .",
    "the fact that there exists an infinite number of local minima and that the infimum of @xmath118 is @xmath120 implies that there exists an infinite sequence of points in momentum space , @xmath289 , that are local minima of @xmath118 , such that @xmath290 .",
