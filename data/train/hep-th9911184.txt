    "recent progress in string duality has stimulated a great deal of interest in yang - mills instantons on higher dimensional manifolds of special holonomy.@xcite the higher dimensional yang - mills instanton equations on such manifolds have been given in several papers.@xcite@xmath1@xcite it is known that some yang - mills instantons on the manifolds can be extended to solitonic solutions of the low energy effective theory of the heterotic string@xcite preserving @xmath2 or @xmath3 of the 10-dimensional @xmath4 supersymmetry .",
    "the manifolds of special holonomy admit covariantly constant spinors and define the supersymmetric cycles ( calibrated submanifolds).@xcite solitons and instantons of superstring theory or m - theory can be considered to be wrapping branes around a supersymmetric cycle.@xcite the manifolds also play an important role in generalizations of the donaldson - floer - witten theory to higher dimensions.@xcite baulieu et al@xcite found a topological action on a 8-dimensional manifold of @xmath5 holonomy ; their covariant gauge fixing conditions lead to yang - mills instanton equations on the manifold . compared with the 4-dimensional case ,",
    "there are a few explicit yang - mills instantons on 7- and 8-dimensional manifolds of @xmath6 and @xmath5 holonomy.@xcite recently yang - mills instantons on a 8-dimensional manifold of @xmath5 holonomy have been examined in detail.@xcite    in this paper we investigate yang - mills instantons on a 7-dimensional manifold of @xmath6 holonomy . our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 and section 3 we briefly review the octonionic algebra and the explicit metric of a manifold of @xmath6 holonomy given by gibbons et al;@xcite in section 4 we express yang - mills instantons on 7-dimensional manifolds of @xmath6 holonomy ; in section 5 , under a spherically symmetric ansatz , we solve the yang - mills instanton equations on the manifold described in section 3 , and present some new explicit solutions obtained from the riccati equation and numerical solutions .",
    "in this section we briefly review the octonionic algebra following the papers.@xcite the exceptional lie group @xmath0 which is a subgroup of @xmath5 is the automorphism group of the octonionic algebra .",
    "the generators of @xmath5 are given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 are 7-dimensional @xmath9 matrices defined by @xmath10 the generators of the octonionic algebra @xmath11 obey the relations @xmath12 where @xmath13 is totally antisymmetric tensor with non zero components @xmath14 if the dual tensor @xmath15 is defined by @xmath16 the following relations are satisfied @xmath17 by the use of the tensor @xmath15 , one can decompose the 21-dimensional lie algebra of @xmath5 into the direct sum of the 14-dimensional lie algebra of @xmath6 and the 7-dimensional orthogonal subspace @xmath18 .",
    "indeed , the projector @xmath19 onto the lie algebra of @xmath6 and the projector @xmath20 onto @xmath18 are given by @xmath21 thus the generators @xmath22 of @xmath0 can be realized as@xcite @xmath23",
    "in this section we describe the explicit metric on a 7-dimensional manifold of @xmath0 holonomy .",
    "it has been first given as a metric on the @xmath24 bundle over @xmath25 by solving the einstein equation:@xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are functions solely of the radial coordinate @xmath29 .",
    "the symbols @xmath30 denote the left invariant 1-forms on the @xmath25 base manifold and the symbols @xmath31 denote the left invariant 1-forms on the fiber @xmath24 .",
    "they satisfy @xmath32 then @xmath33 connection @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 and the explicit forms of the functions are @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "we can also construct the metric ( [ ginst ] ) by solving the first order equation for the spin connection,@xcite @xmath38 under the spherically symmetric ansatz ( [ ginst ] ) , the orthonormal basis is @xmath39 where @xmath40 , and the spin connection @xmath41 is obtained by the equations @xmath42 and @xmath43 : @xmath44 eq .",
    "( [ spininst ] ) then reduces to the following nonlinear ordinary equations : @xmath45 which reproduce the solution ( [ kai ] ) .",
    "here we define a yang - mills instanton equation on the 7-dimensional manifold of @xmath6 holonomy in terms of a special closed @xmath46-form @xmath47,@xcite @xmath48 using the antisymmetric tensor @xmath13 , the 3-form @xmath47 can be written as @xmath49 and then eq . ( [ inst ] ) becomes @xmath50 the seven components of eq .",
    "( [ yminst ] ) are as follows : @xmath51 the curvatures ( [ yminst ] ) provide the solutions of the yang - mills equation on the manifold , @xmath52 , as a consequence of the bianchi identity",
    ". we shall call solutions of ( [ yminst ] ) yang - mills instantons .",
    "the yang - mills instantons can be embedded into supersymmetric theories as solutions to the equation of motion .",
    "it is known that there is a spinor @xmath53 on the manifold of @xmath6 holonomy which satisfies the conditions : @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the covariant derivative of the levi - civita connection on the manifold.@xcite then , one can use the covariantly constant spinor as a global supersymmetric parameter defined on the manifold .",
    "the supersymmetric transformation of a spinor field @xmath56 , a super partner of yang - mills connection , @xmath57 is zero according to the eqs .",
    "( [ yminst ] ) and ( [ chii ] ) .",
    "so the yang - mills instanton becomes a supersymmetric solution preserving the spinor @xmath53 .",
    "note that the spin connection leads to a @xmath6 yang - mills connection : @xmath58 using ( [ spininst ] ) and the symmetry between the first and second pair of indices of the riemann curvature @xmath59 , we can see that the curvature of @xmath60 satisfies the yang - mills instanton equation ( [ yminst]).@xcite",
    "now we construct yang - mills instantons on the 7-dimensional manifold of @xmath6 holonomy described in section 3 . referring to the spin connection ( [ spinconnb])-([spinconne ] )",
    ", we propose a spherically symmetric ansatz for the @xmath6 yang - mills connection @xmath61 : @xmath62 where @xmath63 are the functions of the radial coordinate @xmath29 .",
    "we can see that the above connection satisfies @xmath64 and so does their curvature , i.e. , they are just projected onto the lie algebra of @xmath6 .",
    "note that the indices denote those of the lie algebra of @xmath6 , not of the differential forms .",
    "this connection reproduces eq .",
    "( [ sa ] ) by putting @xmath65    the components of the curvature @xmath66 are explicitly given by @xmath67 @xmath68    let us consider the yang - mills instanton equation ( [ yminst ] ) for the curvature @xmath69 : @xmath70 after some calculations , we obtain a set of ordinary differential equations for @xmath71 : @xmath72 eq .",
    "( [ eq : abcd2 ] ) can be satisfied in three cases ( i ) @xmath73 , ( ii ) @xmath74 ( iii)@xmath75 so we study these cases separately .    in case ( i )",
    ", we have two solutions : @xmath76 the first one is nothing but the connection ( [ sa ] ) , while the second one is a new solution .",
    "although their difference is only the signature of @xmath77 , these two solutions lead to different curvatures .    in cases ( ii ) and",
    "( iii ) , @xmath77 is zero from ( [ eq : abcd6 ] ) so that the yang - mills instanton equation ( [ yminst ] ) gives two nonlinear ordinary differential equations for @xmath78 and @xmath79 : @xmath80 where we have used eqs .",
    "( [ eq : abc ] ) and ( [ kai ] ) .",
    "let us introduce new variables @xmath81 and @xmath82 , @xmath83 and a new parameter @xmath84",
    ". then eqs .",
    "( [ eq : reduction1 ] ) and ( [ eq : reduction ] ) become @xmath85    in case ( ii ) , the eq .",
    "( [ eq : mujigen2 ] ) is trivial as @xmath86 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : mujigen1 ] ) becomes the riccati equation : @xmath87 we can find a general solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : x ] ) : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is an arbitrary integration constant . taking the limit @xmath90",
    ", we have a special solution @xmath91 . for the explicit solution ( [ xsol ] ) the nonzero components of the yang - mills connection and the curvature are @xmath92 and @xmath93 . in this case",
    "the curvature becomes @xmath94 where @xmath95 are @xmath33 generators ; the gauge group reduces to @xmath33 from @xmath6 .",
    "the explicit components of the curvature become @xmath96    it is known that there are no yang - mills instantons with finite action on the n - dimensional flat space ( or sphere ) unless @xmath97@xcite unfortunately , the action for our solution diverges too .",
    "however the second chern class evaluated on the fiber @xmath98 has a finite value : @xmath99 where @xmath100 refers to the adjoint representation of @xmath33 and @xmath101 is the volume of @xmath33 .",
    "note that the value comes from the infinite surface according to @xmath102 at @xmath103 .",
    "the meaning of the finite second chern class remains an open problem here .",
    "now we proceed to case ( iii ) .",
    "we first note that the two points on the @xmath104-plane , @xmath105 , are fixed points , i.e. , the stationary solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mujigen1 ] ) and ( [ eq : mujigen2 ] ) .",
    "we calculate other solutions numerically and show the flows of appropriate numerical solutions in figure 1 .",
    "the arrows show the growing direction of @xmath29 .",
    "we can see general features of the solutions if we rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mujigen1 ] ) and ( [ eq : mujigen2 ] ) as @xmath106 note that the external field @xmath107 coming from the background metric is included in the equations .",
    "if we consider the asymptotic region ( large radial coordinate region ) , we can regard eqs .",
    "( [ bibxy ] ) and ( [ w ] ) as gradient flow equations since @xmath107 approaches a constant .",
    "then two fixed points , @xmath108 , appear , adding to the points @xmath109 and @xmath110 described above . by evaluating the @xmath111 hessian matrix @xmath112 @xmath113 at the four fixed points",
    ", we can see that @xmath114 is a stable point and @xmath115 are saddle points ( the morse index is @xmath116 ) .",
    "this analysis provides a qualitative explanation for the behavior of the flows in figure 1 .",
