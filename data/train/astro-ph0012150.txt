    "studies of the stellar populations in nearby galaxies provide a powerful tool for determining the key physical parameters of galaxy evolution such as the age ( star formation history ) , the chemical composition and enrichment history , the stellar initial mass function , environmental effects , and the dynamical history of the system . using the hst",
    ", it is possible to photometer individual stars down to very faint magnitudes , and to interpret the observable parameters such as the morphology of the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "this approach is a logical stepping stone to understanding galaxy evolution and provides a physical basis for understanding observations of high redshift galaxies and their implications for cosmological models .",
    "detailed analysis of the intermediate and old stellar populations of local group galaxies should reveal histories in accordances with those implied by studies of galaxies at higher redshift ( tolstoy 1999 ) .",
    "with the appropriate data , which currently are obtained primarily by using hst , this hypothesis can be directly tested .",
    "here we are presenting new hst observations of a field in the halo of ic 1613 , a dwarf irregular galaxy in the local group . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the variable stars of ic 1613 and , in particular , their relevance to its distance determination . in a future paper",
    ", we will reconstruct the star formation history of ic 1613 by analysis of the stellar populations .",
    "the known properties of ic 1613 have recently been summarized by van den bergh ( 2000 ) .",
    "we will give only a short summary of relevant properties .",
    "because of its proximity ( distance @xmath8 kpc ) , its high galactic latitude ( @xmath960.6@xmath10 ) and thus little galactic extinction , and its inclination ( 38@xmath10 , lake & skillman 1989 ) , ic 1613 provides an excellent opportunity to observe stellar populations in a relatively low - metallicity environment .",
    "interestingly , there are few studies of the metallicity in ic 1613 .",
    "mateo ( 1998 ) gives a value of the mean iron abundance for the old and intermediate age stellar populations of @xmath11 ( from lee et al .",
    "1993 using the rgb color at @xmath12 ; see also cole et al . 1999 ) and an oxygen abundance of the interstellar medium of 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath13 ( talent 1980 ) . due to the high galactic latitude , the reddening to ic 1613 is very low , and here we adopt an extinction of @xmath14 from schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "the distance to ic 1613 was determined from cepheid variable stars early on by baade ( sandage 1971 ) and , based in part on the observations of cepheids by freedman ( 1988 ) , madore & freedman ( 1991 ) placed ic 1613 at a distance of 765 kpc ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "saha et al .",
    "( 1992 ) observed rr lyrae variable stars and derived a distance of 660 kpc ( @xmath16 ) . using the observation of the tip of the red giant branch , lee et al .",
    "( 1993 ) derived a distance of 714 kpc ( @xmath17 ) , a value confirmed by the wfpc2 study of an inner field of ic 1613 by cole et al .",
    "these values are all consistent within the errors , but their differences may be dominated by systematic errors .",
    "cole et al .",
    "( 1999 ) presented an initial study of ic 1613 stellar populations , based on 10700s of integration in both f555w and f814w , as well as 2600s in f439w , of a field nearer the center of the galaxy .",
    "they found evidence of a continuous star forming history , with the presence of all expected components of the cmd ( main sequence , red supergiants , blue and red helium burners , asymptotic red giants , red giants , and a red clump ) , as well as a hint of a blue horizontal branch . from the cmd morphology of the central field ,",
    "cole et al .",
    "derived an approximate age - metallicity relation for ic 1613 , finding it similar in form to that of the smc but @xmath18 dex more metal - poor at any given age .",
    "their data were not designed for variable star study ( the primary goal of this paper ) , however , so we will leave a detailed comparison between their results and those from these data for a future paper on the stellar populations .",
    "a critical issue in the use of extragalactic stellar distance indicators is their sensitivity to changes in metallicity .",
    "this question received a good deal of attention in the recent literature ( e.g. , kennicutt et al .",
    "1998 , sandage , bell , & tripicco 1999 , caputo , and marconi , & musella 2000 for discussions of the cepheid scale ; mcnamara 1997 , caputo et al .",
    "2000 , and demarque et al .",
    "2000 for rr lyraes ; lee et al . 1993 and salaris & cassisi 1998 for the rgb tip ; and girardi & salaris 2000 and udalski 2000 for the red clump ) .",
    "a fundamental point in these discussions is whether offsets due to metallicity are more or less important than uncertainties in the various luminosity zero points .",
    "since the first rung of the variable star distance ladder is the magellanic clouds , which are moderately metal - poor , observations of similar galaxies , such as ic  1613 , provide the opportunity to empirically test for the importance of modest variations in metallicity among metal - poor systems . in the present observations , we are able to measure the magnitudes of four independent `` standard candles ''  rr lyrae variable stars , cepheid variable stars , the tip of the red giant branch , and the mean magnitude of the red clump  in a galaxy that has slightly lower metallicity than the small magellanic cloud . by comparing these four distance determinations to those of the magellanic clouds",
    ", we are able to test for systematic differences associated with each indicator and potential metallicity dependencies .",
    "wfpc2 observations of a field in the halo of ic 1613 were obtained during 22 - 27 august 1999 , as part of program go-7496 , whose purpose is to investigate the stellar populations of dwarf irregular galaxies . the field center ( 01@xmath19 04@xmath20 26.7@xmath21 , + 02@xmath22 03 16  , j2000 ) is located 11.6 southwest of the center of the galaxy and 6.7 southwest of the field studied by cole et al .",
    "there is no overlap with the field examined by saha et al .",
    "( 1992 ) in the previous ic 1613 rr lyrae study , which is 14.6 to the west , or with the field of antonello et al .",
    "the data consist of 48 1200s images : 16 in f555w and 32 in f814w , spread evenly among four dithering pointings .",
    "each orbit consisted of two images in the same filter to aid in cosmic ray removal .",
    "a 25th orbit was used to obtain two f656n ( h@xmath23 ) images , which were used for other purposes , but not for the variable star work that is the topic of this paper .",
    "the data were obtained from the stsci archive using on the fly calibration , and thus were pipeline - calibrated using the best available calibration images at the time of retrieval .",
    "the images were then reduced using the hstphot package ( dolphin 2000a ) .",
    "the data quality image ( c1f ) was used to mask bad and questionable pixels , and the pairs of images from each orbit were combined for cosmic ray removal , producing 8 clean 2400s images in f555w and 16 images in f814w . a deep image produced from combining all eight f814w images at the first pointing is shown in figure [ figimage ] . the sky image ( which contains calculated sky values at each pixel and is determined before running photometry for uncrowded images for greater efficiency ) was then calculated and hot pixels removed using the hstphot utilities .",
    "photometry was made using the _ multiphot _ routine of hstphot , which solves the photometry simultaneously on multiple images ( all 24 , in this case ) in order to reduce the number of free parameters .",
    "the detection threshold was a minimum signal to noise of 3.5 in both the combined f555w and combined f814w measurements .",
    "cte loss corrections and calibrations were made using dolphin ( 2000b ) . because of the presence of bright , isolated stars , psf solutions and aperture corrections were made for each chip of each image .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram is shown in figure [ figcmd ] , using all stars with the goodness - of - fit parameter @xmath24 , @xmath25object sharpness@xmath26 ( sharpness of a perfect star is zero ) , and total signal - to - noise of at least 5 in both f555w and f814w . in order to eliminate poor detections ,",
    "these requirements were also made on the detections at each epoch , with detections failing to meet the @xmath27 , sharpness , and signal - to - noise criteria eliminated . to verify the accuracy of our photometry , we reduced the data at one pointing independently , using dophot procedures described by saha et al .",
    "this comparison is shown in detail in dolphin ( 2000a ) , with agreement to within 0.01 magnitudes in both filters .    before proceeding with the variable star search ,",
    "it was necessary to determine the maximum accuracy of the photometry . this was done by comparing the magnitudes of well - measured upper red giant branch stars at each epoch with the combined magnitudes .",
    "this comparison , which tests both the reliability of the photometry and that of the aperture corrections , showed a median scatter of 0.015 magnitudes .",
    "this value was adopted as the minimum error in the variable star work , with all smaller photometric uncertainties increased to 0.015 magnitudes .",
    "the source of this error is a combination of photometric error from the undersampled images and error in the aperture corrections .",
    "figure [ figscatter ] shows the scatter ( individual epoch minus combined magnitude ) for all stars .",
    "the locations of the cepheids ( f555w of @xmath28 ) and rr lyraes ( f555w of @xmath29 ) are shown by the excess scatter , and the limiting accuracy of 0.015 magnitudes at the bright end is clear . otherwise , the figure is typical for a star - forming dwarf .",
    "variable star candidates were identified using a procedure similar to that described by saha & hoessel ( 1990 ) . for a star to be considered a candidate variable",
    ", it had to meet four criteria .",
    "first , the star had to have good photometry in at least 16 of the 24 epochs , and an rms scatter of at least 0.08 magnitudes .",
    "second , the reduced @xmath30 of the photometry , as defined by @xmath31 had to be at least 6.25 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the numbers of exposures in the two filters , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the magnitudes at each epoch , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the mean magnitudes for each star .",
    "the minimum value of 6.25 corresponds to mean deviation of 2.5@xmath38 , and was determined empirically for these data .",
    "a second @xmath30 test was made in order to reduce the ability of single bad points to cause a false detection .",
    "the one - third of the points contributing the most to @xmath30 were eliminated , and the reduced @xmath30 recalculated from the remaining points . if this value was not at least 0.25 , the star was eliminated from the list of candidate variables .",
    "again , the value of 0.25 was determined empirically .",
    "finally , a modified lafler - kinman algorithm ( lafler & kinman 1965 ) was used to test the stars for periodicity .",
    "this was implemented by computing @xmath39 for periods between 0.1 and 5.0 days .",
    "the @xmath39 parameter is calculated by determining the light curve for a trial period and using the equation @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of exposures for a given filter , @xmath42 is the magnitude at epoch @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the mean magnitude . if the trial period is incorrect , @xmath45 will be the difference between two random points , @xmath46 times the rms scatter , producing a @xmath39 of 2 . however , if the trial period is correct , the difference between adjacent points will scale as 1/@xmath41 , producing a @xmath39 that scales as 1/@xmath47 . a goodness of periodicity parameter",
    "can then be defined as @xmath48 . for this study ,",
    "the off - period @xmath39 was defined to be the 90th percentile value of @xmath39 over the range of trial periods , giving our goodness of periodicity parameter of @xmath49 .    for the present data set , however , a sufficient number of observations was made in both f555w and f814w for light curve measurements to be made in both filters .",
    "thus a combined goodness of periodicity parameter needed to be developed .",
    "given that @xmath50 scales as the number of observations in a given filter when at the correct period , a reasonable combined parameter would be @xmath51 where the constant of 0.25 is included to force the off - period @xmath52 to 1 .",
    "in the general case , a goodness of periodicity for any number of filters can be calculated with @xmath53 for this study , @xmath52 was required to be at least 2.0 for a star to be considered a candidate variable .",
    "we note that , because @xmath39 is statistically independent of amplitude ( doubling the amplitude would leave @xmath39 unchanged , for example ) , our determination of @xmath52 does not account for the larger amplitudes of rr lyraes and cepheids in @xmath54 .",
    "it is not immediately obvious if or how such an accounting should be made .",
    "nevertheless , we have experimented with other algorithms for the calculation of @xmath52 and @xmath39 , such as @xmath55 and find the selection of variables and their periods to be quite robust , regardless of the choice of algorithm .    out of the 12983 total stars , the steps listed above selected 57 variable star candidates , which were examined interactively .",
    "as this study is primarily concerned with pulsating variables , stars that were variable in only one filter and stars whose f555w and f814w light curves were out of phase were removed from the candidate list , as were false detections , leaving 26 stars in the list .",
    "eleven fall in the instability strip above the horizontal branch , and were classified as cepheids .",
    "thirteen fall along the horizontal branch , and were classified as rr lyraes .",
    "the remaining two are possible eclipsing binaries .",
    "figure [ figvcmd ] shows the ic 1613 cmd , with the variable stars highlighted .",
    "it should be emphasized that our detection efficiency was not 100% ( and was much lower for stars with period greater than 0.6 days , the duration of our longest set of consecutive orbits ) .",
    "thus we can not rule out the existence of population ii cepheids , nor are we confident that the `` non - variable '' stars falling within the instability strip are not , in fact , variables that were not detected . additionally , while the cmd from combined photometry is largely complete to @xmath56 , the single epoch signal - to - noise of stars below the horizontal branch is such that detection of variables would have been extremely difficult .",
    "mean magnitudes were calculated for each variable , using a period - weighted average @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the phase and @xmath42 is the magnitude at each point along the light curve .",
    "these values , still in wfpc2 f555w and f814w magnitudes , were then transformed to standard @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "figure [ figrr_lc ] shows the light curves of the thirteen rr lyrae candidates , and table [ tabrr ] contains their positions and data .",
    "all positions are given relative to the f555w images at the first pointing .",
    "the final column in table [ tabrr ] lists the quality of the light curve , from 0 to 4 ( although all stars with quality values of 0 or 1 have been removed ) .",
    "the criteria that are used to determine the light curve quality are the uniqueness of the period , the presence or lack of bad points , light curves in phase between the two filters , and the resemblance to a template light curve of the appropriate class of object .",
    "we do not attempt to distinguish between fundamental - mode and overtone pulsators in the rr lyraes , given the relatively poor signal - to - noise at each epoch ( the typical uncertainty in both filters is 0.1 magnitudes ) .",
    "however , we do note that the short periods of variables v14 and v16 make them likely overtone pulsators , and that those of v19 and v23 make them possible overtone pulsators .",
    "multiplying the uncertainties in @xmath61 by 4 divided by the light curve quality , and taking an average weighted by @xmath62 , the best @xmath61 for the sample of 13 rr lyraes is @xmath63 magnitudes . eliminating the two possible outliers fainter than v=25.2",
    ", the weighted average is @xmath64 . similarly eliminating the two possible outliers brighter than v=24.8 ,",
    "the weighted average becomes @xmath65 .",
    "given the very small shift in the mean magnitude after eliminating the lowest and highest points , it seems reasonable to adopt the value of @xmath66 for the mean rr lyrae magnitude , while adding the @xmath67 shift in quadrature to the 0.03 magnitude uncertainty , producing a final uncertainty of 0.04 magnitudes .",
    "this mean @xmath59 magnitude is consistent with the value of @xmath68 obtained by saha et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , which corresponds to a mean @xmath59 magnitude of @xmath69 ( saha & hoessel 1987 ) .",
    "an extinction @xmath70 of 0.08 magnitudes is adopted from schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( assuming @xmath71 ) , with the uncertainty estimated to be @xmath72 magnitudes , producing an extinction - corrected mean @xmath59 magnitude of @xmath73 .",
    "once the mean @xmath59 magnitude is established , obtaining a distance estimate requires a value for the absolute magnitude .",
    "this is generally done by adopting a value for the mean rr lyrae metallicity and a preferred @xmath74 vs. @xmath75 relation .",
    "we can measure the mean rr lyrae metallicity via the red giant branch , whose tip spans the color range @xmath76 . assuming that rr lyraes are only produced in populations older than 10 gyr",
    ", we find an allowable metallicity range of @xmath77 ( with @xmath78 and @xmath79 gyr falling along the blue edge of our rgb and @xmath80 and @xmath81 gyr falling along the red edge ) , based on isochrones interpolated from those of girardi et al .",
    "thus we find a value of @xmath82 for the rr lyrae metallicity . for comparison , metallicity calculations using the da costa & armandroff ( 1990 ) @xmath83 and lee et al .",
    "( 1993 ) @xmath84 calibration produce the identical metallicity ( @xmath82 ) , after conversion to the carretta & gratton ( 1997 ) metallicity scale .",
    "the range of resulting absolute magnitudes is rather large , however , producing significant uncertainty in the rr lyrae distance . theoretical models of girardi et al . ( 2000 ) predict an absolute magnitude of @xmath85 ; those of demarque et al .",
    "( 2000 ) produce an absolute magnitude of @xmath86 ; and those of caputo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) produce an absolute magnitude of @xmath87 .",
    "carretta et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find a relation based on lmc distances and hipparcos parallax measurements of subdwarfs that produces an absolute magnitude of @xmath88 .",
    "other theoretical models produce brighter rr lyraes , with caloi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and cassisi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) finding @xmath89 for the zahb ; the mean rr lyrae magnitude being about 0.1 magnitudes brighter .",
    "observational determinations based on hipparcos show a larger spread in values , such as those of fernley et al .",
    "1998 , which produces an absolute magnitude of @xmath90 , and gratton et al .",
    "1997 , which produces an absolute magnitude of @xmath91 .",
    "we therefore conservatively adopt a value of @xmath92 , which produces an distance modulus of @xmath93 .",
    "we will return to the issue of the rr lyrae zero point later , using independent distance measurements to derive the absolute magnitude of rr lyraes in ic 1613 .",
    "although the observations were designed primarily to detect rr lyraes , eleven short - period cepheids were also discovered .",
    "figure [ figceph_lc ] shows their light curves , and table [ tabceph ] contains their positions and data . as with table [ tabrr ] , the quality rating ranges from 0 to 4 , with 4 being the cleanest light curve and best - defined period .",
    "the cepheids were also classified into fundamental - mode and overtone pulsators , with all but v13 classified based on their light curves . as shown by mantegazza & poretti ( 1992 ) , overtone pulsators have a fourier spectrum with a weaker second order than do fundamental pulsators , meaning that their light curves will be more sinusoidal .",
    "ten of the eleven cepheids were thus classified , and the period - luminosity relation in figure [ figceph_pl ] shows this discrimination to be successful , with all overtone pulsators falling well above the mean period - luminosity relation .",
    "the period of v13 was poorly - constrained due to the poor sampling of epochs , and thus it could not be classified similarly . however , its position on the period - luminosity relation was clearly in the space occupied by overtone pulsators , allowing its classification based on period and magnitude .",
    "the presence of five fundamental - mode cepheids allows for a second distance measurement from these data . one can do this following madore & freedman ( 1991 ) , determining the reddening - free magnitude @xmath94 ( assuming @xmath95 ) for the five cepheids and calculate the reddening - free absolute magnitude @xmath96 using the madore & freedman ( 1991 ) calibration",
    "applying this technique to the ic 1613 fundamental cepheids and using a weighted average of the uncertainties gives a reddening - corrected distance modulus of @xmath97 and a mean extinction @xmath70 of @xmath98 magnitudes .",
    "the @xmath59 and @xmath60 period - luminosity relations are shown in figure [ figceph_pl ] , with the cepheids found by freedman ( 1988 ) plotted as well . as can be seen in the figure , the present data are consistent with and provide an extension to the longer - period data of freedman ( 1988 ) .    however , the eros result ( bauer et al .",
    "1999 ) of a steepening in the period - luminosity relation for periods shorter than two days implies that three of our five fundamental - mode cepheids should be eliminated from this calculation .",
    "( this break is shown with the dashed line in figure [ figceph_pl ] . )",
    "thus the reddening - corrected distance modulus becomes @xmath99 for the two remaining fundamental - mode cepheids .",
    "the large uncertainty is the result of the use of the reddening - free distance , which multiplies @xmath59 uncertainties by 2.43 and @xmath60 by 1.43 and adds them in quadrature .",
    "given the low extinction to ic 1613 and the presence of a good extinction estimate of @xmath14 , the uncertainty can be lowered by correcting the individual @xmath59 and @xmath60 distance moduli for extinction and combining them .    finally , it should be noted that the @xmath60 photometry of v3 do not adequately sample the full range of the light curve , as the earliest epoch was at a phase of 0.2 after the peak .",
    "thus the phase - averaged @xmath100 magnitude is biased towards fainter magnitudes . because this was not a problem in the @xmath59 photometry",
    ", the procedure of labhardt , sandage , & tammann ( 1997 ) was used to calculate the correct mean @xmath100 , brightening the value from 21.21 to 21.15 .",
    "the data for v6 have a similar problem , but a similar correction is impossible because neither the @xmath59 nor @xmath60 photometry span the entire range of magnitudes .",
    "however , because the @xmath59 light curve omits as much of the trough as the @xmath60 light curve omits of the peak , these errors should largely cancel when averaging the @xmath59 and @xmath60 distances obtained for v6 .",
    "table [ tabcephdist ] shows the mean @xmath59 and @xmath60 magnitudes corrected for extinction values @xmath14 and @xmath101 .",
    "absolute magnitudes @xmath74 and @xmath102 are calculated using madore & freedman ( 1991 ) , with their rms scatter adopted as the uncertainties . given the smaller intrinsic scatter in the @xmath60 period - luminosity relation , the distance for each of the cepheids is weighted twice as much in @xmath60 as in @xmath59 . averaging the values for the two stars gives a best cepheid distance from these data of @xmath103 magnitudes , consistent with the value of @xmath15 determined by madore & freedman ( 1991 ) from the cepheid calibration used here , as well as with previous measurements of sandage ( 1971 ) ; mcalary , madore , & davis ( 1984 ) ; and freedman ( 1988 ) .",
    "the values in figure [ figceph_pl ] are for this distance and the adopted extinction , with the dashed line showing the expected @xmath59 relation for @xmath104 based on the eros result . because of their larger sample size",
    ", we will adopt the madore & freedman ( 1991 ) value in our discussion , after converting it to our adopted extinction of @xmath105 for the sake of comparison with other distance measurements .",
    "this decreases their distance to @xmath106 .",
    "we will discuss possible metallicity effects on the cepheid distance scale below .",
    "although variable stars provide excellent distance indicators , there remain questions about the zero - point calibrations at the 20% level , as well as uncertainties regarding their dependencies on the metallicity of the parent population of stars .",
    "these issues will be discussed in the following section .",
    "ic 1613 provides us also with additional distance benchmarks , which provide further constraints for studying this problem .",
    "the red giant branch ( rgb ) tip ( lee , madore , & freedman 1993 ) and red clump ( paczynski & stanek 1998 , udalski 2000 ) provide two possible standard candles .",
    "the rgb tip in i is especially attractive , given its insensitivity to age and metallicity in theoretical models ( girardi et al .",
    "2000 , for example ) . from the cmd in figure [ figcmd ] and an edge - detection algorithm",
    ", we measure an rgb tip at @xmath107 . however , this value is something of an upper limit to the rgb tip magnitude , as the small number of stars present in the upper rgb makes it plausible that the theoretical rgb extends above the position of these stars . with an upper rgb luminosity function of roughly 7 stars per 0.1 magnitudes ,",
    "our 68% confidence limit for the true rgb tip is 0.03 magnitudes above the brightest star , increasing our uncertainty in the rgb tip measurement to @xmath108 magnitudes .",
    "we can derive a more accurate rgb tip by use of the denser field studied by cole et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which contains significantly more red giants .",
    "reducing those data with hstphot and applying the dolphin ( 2000b ) cte correction and calibration , we find the rgb tip at @xmath109 , consistent with that determined for the present data ( the 0.07 magnitude uncertainty a result of possible rgb - agb confusion near the tip ) .",
    "the luminosity function for the upper rgb is shown in figure [ figtrgb ] . applying our adopted extinction correction of @xmath101 produces an extinction - corrected rgb tip magnitude of @xmath110 .",
    "we find the photometry of cole et al .",
    "nearly 0.1 magnitudes brighter , and note that we adopt the hstphot - based photometry for the inner field , as it is more consistent with the photometry for the outer field ( which was consistent with dophot reductions of the same data ) , and because of the availability of an hstphot - based calibration and cte correction ( dolphin 2000b ) .",
    "the absolute magnitude at the rgb tip can be estimated either empirically ( lee et al .",
    "1993 ) or theoretically ( girardi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "empirical calibrations rest on the globular cluster distance scale , which is itself dependent upon an assumed rr lyrae absolute magnitude calibration , and thus can not be used to make an _ independent _ distance measurement for our study .",
    "theoretical techniques , on the other hand , are subject to uncertainties in the input physics ( castellani & deglinnocenti 1999 ) and the transformation from physical parameters ( luminosity and temperature ) to observed magnitudes and colors . in order to produce an independent distance measurement and to account for the uncertainties , we thus adopt an absolute magnitude calculated from interpolated isochrones from girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , while conservatively adding the difference between this value and that calculated from the lee et al .",
    "( 1993 ) calibration to our uncertainties . fitting the isochrones to our red giant branch for ages from 2 to 15 gyr",
    ", we measure a mean metallicity of @xmath111 and absolute magnitude of @xmath112 . for comparison ,",
    "the calibration given by lee et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , using the equivalent metallicity on the zinn & west ( 1984 ) scale ( @xmath113 from the conversion given by carretta & gratton 1997 ) , produces an absolute magnitude of @xmath114 , consistent but 0.04 magnitudes brighter .",
    "we thus arrive at an rgb tip absolute magnitude of @xmath115 and a distance modulus of @xmath116 .",
    "we note that the rgb tip calibration of salaris & cassisi ( 1998 ) provides a significantly more luminous tip , at @xmath117 , which would increase the ic 1613 distance modulus to @xmath118 .",
    "we are unable to reconcile this value with the red clump distance ( below ) , regardless of the star formation history assumed for ic 1613 .",
    "because the red clump is the only one of the four distance indicators calibrated directly by hipparcos , we choose to adopt the calibration above of @xmath115 , with the rgb tip distance modulus of @xmath116 .",
    "another independent measurement of the distance is provided by the mean @xmath60 magnitude of the red clump .",

    "1999 ) produces a slightly brighter red clump magnitude of @xmath123 .",
    "the difference of 0.04 magnitudes is statistically significant ; the most likely explanation is the presence of a larger fraction of young ( @xmath124 gyr ) stars in the inner field .",
    "determination of the red clump absolute magnitude , however , is significantly more difficult .",
    "udalski ( 2000 ) provides an empirical calibration of @xmath125 vs. metallicity , but this calibration would have to be extrapolated by nearly a dex in metallicity for application to ic 1613 and is based on the assumption that there is no age - metallicity relation in the galactic disk .",
    "neither of those problems can be easily solved analytically , so we instead employ the girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) theoretical isochrones as an accurate relative absolute magnitude indicator , with which we can compare the local disk clump with that of ic 1613 ( a method very similar to `` method 2 '' of girardi & salaris 2000 ) .",

    ", we derive a semi - empirical ic 1613 red clump absolute magnitude of @xmath128 and a red clump distance modulus of @xmath129 .",
    "thus , two additional independent distances can be obtained by use of the rgb tip and the red clump .",
    "the rgb tip distance is corrected for age and metallicity relatively easily , but difficulty in observational determination of the tip magnitude and uncertainty in the calibration create additional error .",
    "in contrast , the red clump position is easily measured with high precision , but the systematics from age- and metallicity - dependencies are not as well - constrained .",
    "with the availability of four independent distance measurements to ic 1613 , we can attempt to determine relative distances between ic 1613 and the magellanic clouds .",
