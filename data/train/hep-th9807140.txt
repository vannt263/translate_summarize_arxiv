    "one of the longstanding problems in high energy physics is to gain analytical control over strongly coupled gauge theories , and , in particular , qcd . many fascinating aspects of qcd , such as confinement , mass gap and chiral symmetry breaking , still lack desired quantitative description , albeit over the years much qualitative ( and numerical ) insight has been gained into these phenomena .",
    "the closest supersymmetric relative of qcd , namely , pure @xmath1 supersymmetric @xmath2 gauge theory _ a priori _ offers a possibility of simplifications ( due to supersymmetry ) , yet it shares most of the qualitative features of qcd .",
    "thus , sqcd without matter is believed to be a confining theory with a mass gap and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to suspect that a better understanding of pure sqcd might shed light on these phenomena in a more general context .",
    "it is not unreasonable to believe that confinement and chiral symmetry breaking might be intimately related @xcite .",
    "if so , understanding chiral symmetry breaking in sqcd might shed some light on the confining properties of ( super)glue .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking in sqcd is due to gaugino condensation .",
    "thus , the composite operator @xmath3 acquires a non - zero expectation value in strongly coupled sqcd : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the dynamically generated scale of sqcd , and @xmath6 is an overall factor which depends on the subtraction scheme .",
    "there are @xmath0 inequivalent vacua labeled by @xmath7 .",
    "this implies that there should exist domain walls connecting pairs of distinct vacua . in @xcite",
    "these domain walls were argued to be bps saturated .",
    "the bps property of the sqcd domain walls suggests that we might be able to gain some analytical control over these solutions , and , therefore , over chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "a seemingly unrelated subject is t hooft s large @xmath0 limit @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was noticed that in this limit the gauge theory diagrams organize themselves in terms of riemann surfaces characterized by the numbers of boundaries and handles , and addition of each extra handle on the surface corresponds to suppression by a factor of @xmath8 .",
    "this observation has led t hooft to speculate that the large @xmath0 gauge theory might be described by some kind of string theory .",
    "then the large @xmath0 expansion of gauge theories would be mapped to the string expansion in terms of the properly weighted world - sheets of various topologies .    in the context of weakly coupled gauge theories ( _ i.e.",
    "_ , when the effective gauge coupling @xmath9 is fixed at a value @xmath10 ) the first concrete realization of this idea was given in @xcite in the context of three dimensional chern - simons gauge theory where the boundaries of the string world - sheet are `` topological '' d - branes .",
    "more recently , string expansion was shown to precisely reproduce t hooft s large @xmath0 expansion for certain four dimensional gauge theories @xcite . here",
    "the boundaries are type iib d3-branes , and the ( open ) qcd string is simply the open string stretched between these d - branes .    as to the case of strongly coupled gauge theories , the story here appears to be much more complicated . in particular , it is unclear what is the string theory that governs the dynamics of the qcd string which is expected to arise as an effective description in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "this string theory is expected to be non - critical @xcite , which makes it difficult to study .",
    "nonetheless , in @xcite witten has made a remarkable observation that there might be a connection between sqcd string and domain walls in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "in particular , based on the assumption that the sqcd domain walls are bps saturated , witten argued that in the large @xmath0 limit the domain walls connecting two vacua labeled by @xmath11 and @xmath12 appear to be objects that are not solitons from the sqcd string viewpoint but rather look like d - branes @xcite on which the sqcd string should be able to end .",
    "such d - brane - like domain walls have recently appeared in @xcite in the context of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "it is desirable to verify the above assertions explicitly since they have important implications for sqcd .",
    "one of the key observations is that there exist d - branes on which the sqcd string can end @xcite .",
    "in particular , the chromo - electric flux contained in the sqcd string that ends on the sqcd d - brane spreads along the d - brane , but away from the d - brane it is trapped in the thin flux tube corresponding to the sqcd string @xcite .",
    "in fact , a test electric charge can only come off a d - brane ( in the transverse direction ) if it is connected to it by the sqcd string .",
    "another way of putting this statement is that the d - branes should support excitations that behave as if they transform in the fundamental of @xmath2 albeit there are no such fields in the original super - yang - mills lagrangian @xcite .",
    "moreover , naively one expects that the pure superglue sqcd contains only closed strings .",
    "however , if large @xmath0 domain walls indeed behave as d - branes , then we must also include open strings in the corresponding ( non - critical ) string theory to be able to describe these domain walls .",
    "this , in a sense , is analogous to what happens in type ii string theory : perturbatively we only expect closed strings ; however , to capture non - perturbative dynamics we must also include open strings which end on the corresponding d - branes .    the purpose of this paper is to give more evidence supporting the d - brane picture for the large @xmath0 sqcd domain walls . in particular , using an indirect construction , we obtain solutions for the large @xmath0 sqcd domain walls which are bps saturated . also , it is important to check that the d - brane picture for the domain walls connecting two vacua labeled by @xmath11 and @xmath13 with @xmath14 is consistent with the fact that the domain walls connecting such vacua with @xmath15 are expected to behave as _ solitons _ of the sqcd string .",
    "moreover , _ a priori _ it is far from being obvious that the domain walls connecting two vacua labeled by @xmath11 and @xmath13 with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , are consistent with the effective sqcd string description . in particular , what is the interpretation of such domain walls in the context of the sqcd string ?",
    "it is , however , difficult to explicitly construct these domain walls ( or even check that they are bps saturated ) directly in the context of sqcd : the order parameter @xmath3 is a composite operator , and we are dealing with a strong coupling regime .",
    "nonetheless , in this paper we use an approximating model which in a certain limit reduces to the large @xmath0 sqcd sqcd meaning that the two theories are the same at low enough energies . ] .",
    "in fact , using this approximating model we will be able to solve for the _ exact _ shapes of domain walls for @xmath14 ( these domain walls are interpreted as sqcd d - branes ) , and also for @xmath15 ( these domain walls are interpreted as solitons of the sqcd string ) .",
    "more precisely , we will obtain the corresponding exact solutions in a certain coordinate system which depends on the khler potential .",
    "the latter we will assume to be non - singular ( in the regime we are interested in here ) .",
    "moreover , it will become clear that these solutions are bps saturated .",
    "also , we will argue that for all other values of @xmath18 the corresponding domain walls in the large @xmath0 limit are described by @xmath18 d - branes separated by large distances .",
    "this provides an important check for the consistency of the d - brane interpretation and fits in the sqcd string picture .",
    "the exact results we obtain in this paper are partly due to the fact that the domain wall problem reduces to a two dimensional problem , namely , of finding soliton configurations in two dimensional @xmath19 massive quantum field theories .",
    "these theories have been studied extensively ( in fact , one of the original motivations to study them was precisely their relevance to domain walls in four dimensional @xmath1 supersymmetric ( gauge ) theories ) , and the vast knowledge of their properties should not be overlooked when studying domain walls .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we review some well known facts about @xmath1 supersymmetric qcd . in section iii",
    "we give a general discussion of domain walls in @xmath1 supersymmetric theories . in section",
    "iv we construct the approximating model , and solve for the domain wall shapes in the large @xmath0 sqcd .",
    "in particular , we explicitly construct the bps solutions corresponding to the d - branes and solitons .",
    "we also identify the limit in which the approximating model reduces to the large @xmath0 sqcd . in section v we discuss the zero modes localized on the domain walls .",
    "in particular , we identify the zero modes localized on the d - branes ( which are described by a three dimensional field theory ) with the @xmath20 gauge supermultiplet in three dimensions as required by the d - brane interpretation . in section",
    "vi we discuss various issues regarding the large @xmath0 sqcd string and domain walls .",
    "in this section we review some well known facts about @xmath1 supersymmetric qcd .",
    "in particular , we briefly discuss gaugino condensation in sqcd without matter .",
    "we then consider domain walls in sqcd . in the subsequent sections we will argue that these domain walls are bps saturated .",
    "consider @xmath1 supersymmetric qcd with @xmath2 gauge group and no matter .",
    "let @xmath5 be the dynamically generated scale .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath21 is the yang - mill gauge coupling constant at some energy scale @xmath22 , then @xmath23 is the scale at which the one - loop renormalized gauge coupling blows up .",
    "( here @xmath24 is the one - loop @xmath25-function coefficient . )    in this theory there is a non - perturbative superpotential due to gaugino condensation : @xmath26 the gaugino condensate is given by @xcite @xmath27 here @xmath7 , that is , there are @xmath0 inequivalent vacua corresponding to @xmath0 different phases for the gaugino condensate .",
    "this is due to spontaneous breaking of @xmath28 chiral symmetry .",
    "the factor @xmath6 ( which _ a priori _ can depend on @xmath0 ) is a positive number , and it depends on the subtraction scheme .",
    "however , the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath6 becomes important in the large @xmath0 limit , in particular , consistency of the sqcd string interpretation for the large @xmath0 domain walls suggests that @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "this also naturally follows from the fact that the gaugino condensate @xmath30 involves a trace over the gauge indices , and the resulting vev should contain the corresponding second casimir factor which in this case is simply @xmath0 .",
    "the superpotential in ( [ gaugino ] ) can be derived as follows @xcite .",
    "consider @xmath1 supersymmetric gauge theory with @xmath2 gauge group and @xmath0 flavors @xmath31 , @xmath32 ( @xmath33 .",
    "the gauge invariant degrees of freedom are mesons @xmath34 , and baryons @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the classical moduli space in this theory receives quantum corrections which can be accounted for via the following superpotential @xcite is identified with the one - loop scale only up to a multiplicative constant that depends on the subtraction scheme .",
    "this constant equals 1 in the @xmath37 scheme . ] : @xmath38 here @xmath39 is the dynamically generated scale of the theory , and @xmath40 is a lagrange multiplier ( @xmath41 is the `` glue - ball '' field ) . to obtain sqcd without matter , let us add a tree - level superpotential of the following form : @xmath42 this superpotential corresponds to giving mass @xmath43 to all @xmath0 flavors . for @xmath44 , at energy scales below @xmath43 we can integrate the heavy flavors out which leaves us with sqcd without matter .",
    "the superpotential now reads @xmath45 the scale matching implies that @xmath46 that is , the scale matching depends on the threshold corrections ( due to the heavy quarks whose mass is of order @xmath43 ) , and , therefore , on the subtraction scheme .",
    "thus , we arrive at ( [ gaugino ] ) .      according to ( [ gaugino ] ) and ( [ cond ] )",
    ", there are @xmath0 inequivalent vacua in @xmath2 sqcd without matter .",
    "we therefore expect that there exist domain walls separating these different vacua @xcite . on dimensional grounds",
    "we expect the tension of such a wall to be of order @xmath47 .",
    "it is , however , possible to compute the tension exactly in terms of the gaugino condensate provided that they are bps saturated @xcite in @xcite . ] . consider the domain wall separating the vacua with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the tension of the wall ( provided that it is bps saturated ) is nothing but the value of the central charge @xmath50 ( in the corresponding central extension of the @xmath1 superalgebra ) .",
    "the central charge is proportional to ( the absolute value of ) the difference between the values of the superpotential in the two vacua : @xmath51 we therefore have the following tension for the domain wall : @xmath52    it is , however , difficult to explicitly construct these domain walls ( or even check that they are bps saturated ) directly in the context of sqcd : the order parameter @xmath3 is a composite operator , and we are dealing with a strong coupling regime .",
    "nonetheless , in the subsequent sections we will see that using an indirect construction ( _ i.e. _ , by using a certain trick ) it is possible to gain some insight into the structure of these domain walls . in particular , we will argue that these domain walls are indeed bps saturated .",
    "moreover , in the large @xmath0 limit we will even be able to obtain the exact shapes of these domain walls .",
    "( more precisely , we will do so in a certain coordinate system which depends on the khler potential . )",
    "the presence of bps saturated domain walls in sqcd has important implications @xcite .",
    "strongly coupled sqcd in the large @xmath0 limit is believed to be described by a string theory with the string coupling @xmath53 @xcite . extended solitons in this string theory are expected to have tension which goes as @xmath54 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that not all of the above domain walls appear to be solitons from the sqcd string viewpoint .",
    "thus , consider `` elementary '' domain walls ( with @xmath12 ) . in the large",
    "@xmath0 limit their tension goes as @xmath6 . for these objects to be sqcd solitons we therefore would have to assume that @xmath55 .",
    "let us now consider the walls with @xmath56 .",
    "the wall tension in these cases goes as @xmath57 ( provided that @xmath55 ) .",
    "this result is ( at least ) strange since we do not expect such dependence on @xmath58 for any bps objects in the sqcd string context .    to avoid the above problem with the @xmath56 domain walls",
    ", we can assume that @xmath29 .",
    "in this case these objects have tension that goes as @xmath59 , and they can be interpreted as solitons of the sqcd string .",
    "now , however , we see that the `` elementary '' domain walls have tension which goes as @xmath60 .",
    "these can not therefore be interpreted as solitons .",
    "in @xcite it was suggested that such domain walls can be viewed as d - branes @xcite in the sqcd string context .",
    "open sqcd strings then can end on these d - branes @xcite .",
    "here we would like to point out another important property of the domain walls in sqcd .",
    "thus , consider the domain walls with @xmath61 , where @xmath17 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath29 , then for these domain walls we naively get the tension that goes as @xmath62 .",
    "such states would be difficult to interpret in the context of the large @xmath0 sqcd string . in the following",
    "we will argue that in the large @xmath0 limit these domain walls actually correspond to @xmath63 `` elementary '' domain walls separated by large distances .",
    "this , in particular , avoids the problem with interpreting these domain walls in the context of the large @xmath0 sqcd string .    before we conclude this section",
    ", we note that if we chose @xmath6 to be independent of @xmath0 we would run into a puzzle @xcite : the @xmath56 domain walls would look like d - branes , but the `` elementary '' domain walls would have tension independent of the string coupling ( and , therefore , would have to be considered as fundamental , that is , on the equal footing with the sqcd strings ) .",
    "in this section we provide some details concerning generic properties of domain walls in @xmath1 supersymmetric theories .",
    "in particular , we discuss the relation between the domain walls in four dimensional @xmath1 theories and solitons in ( massive ) @xmath19 quantum field theories in two dimensions .",
    "consider an @xmath1 supersymmetric theory with one chiral superfield @xmath64 .",
    "let @xmath65 be the superpotential in this theory such that the f - flatness condition @xmath66 has a discrete set of solutions @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "in such a theory we expect presence of domain walls separating inequivalent vacua @xmath67 and @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath71 be the spatial coordinate transverse to the wall .",
    "then asymptotically we have @xmath72 as @xmath73 , and @xmath74 as @xmath75 .",
    "such domain walls may or may not be bps saturated .",
    "note that the problem at hand is really a two dimensional problem as the coordinates @xmath76 along the wall play no role in the discussion .",
    "thus , our problem effectively reduces to that of finding bps solitons in two dimensional massive @xmath19 quantum field theories .",
    "more concretely , we are led to finding configurations of minimum energy ( interpolating between a pair of distinct vacua ) , which are solitonic solutions of the landau - ginsburg equations . for a general landau - ginsburg theory @xcite the energy of a time - independent configuration",
    "is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the scalar potential of the theory . here",
    "@xmath79 is the khler metric which is related to the khler potential @xmath80 via @xmath81 .",
    "note that @xmath82 can be rewritten as follows : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is an arbitrary constant phase .",
    "note that @xmath82 is independent of @xmath85 . for the choice",
    "@xmath86 we obtain the bound @xmath87 the bps solutions ( for which @xmath88 ) are those that satisfy the following equation : @xmath89 subject to the boundary conditions @xmath90 as @xmath91 . going back to the domain walls in four dimensions , we have the exact same bps equation ( [ bps ] ) , and the tension of the domain wall is given by @xmath92    typically , one does not know the exact form of the khler metric @xmath93 .",
    "however , for the case of a single superfield @xmath64 we are considering here one can still make certain statements about the corresponding soliton solutions .",
    "thus , let @xmath64 be a function of a new coordinate @xmath94 such that it satisfies the following equation @xmath95 with the boundary conditions @xmath96 as @xmath97",
    ". suppose we are able to find the corresponding solution for @xmath98 .",
    "next , consider the following change of variables : @xmath99 where @xmath98 is the corresponding solution .",
    "note that if we express @xmath64 as a function of @xmath71 , then @xmath100 will satisfy the original bps equation ( [ bps ] ) with the corresponding boundary conditions .",
    "the change of variables ( [ diff ] ) is simply a diffeomorphism which is one - to - one as long as the khler metric @xmath93 is non - singular . throughout this paper ( when discussing domain walls in four dimensional @xmath1 theories or the corresponding solitons in two dimensional @xmath19 theories )",
    "we will assume that the corresponding khler metric @xmath93 is indeed non - singular .",
    "moreover , we will always work in the coordinate system parametrized by @xmath94 , but we will drop the prime for the sake of simplicity of the corresponding expressions .",
    "( this is effectively equivalent to the case where @xmath101 . )",
    "note that as long as the khler metric @xmath93 is non - singular , the solution of ( [ bps1 ] ) ( with the appropriate boundary conditions ) implies that the corresponding solution of ( [ bps ] ) exists .",
    "moreover , this solution is bps saturated .",
    "the solitons in landau - ginsburg theories have been studied in detail @xcite .",
    "many of these models are integrable .",
    "the general conditions for existence of bps solutions were formulated in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will mainly be interested ( for the reasons that will become clear in the next section ) in the so called @xmath102 models for which the superpotential is given by @xmath103 this model was studied in detail in @xcite . in particular , there are @xmath0 distinct vacua in this model with @xmath104 , @xmath7 .",
    "the soliton interpolating between the vacua @xmath105 and @xmath106 has the energy @xmath107 all of these solitons are bps saturated .",
    "( here , as we have already pointed out , we take @xmath101 . ) here we also mention that the ( purely elastic ) @xmath108-matrix is exactly calculable in this model @xcite .",
    "as we already mentioned , it is difficult to explicitly construct domain wall solutions in the context of sqcd which is a strongly coupled theory .",
    "we can circumvent this difficulty by considering a theory which is not sqcd itself but is closely related to it , in particular , it shares the qualitative features of sqcd such as chiral symmetry breaking and presence of domain walls . more precisely , we would like to approximate sqcd by another theory which in an appropriate limit reproduces sqcd .",
    "we can expect that such an approximating theory can not reproduce ( by taking a simple limit of any kind ) sqcd at finite @xmath0 : the latter is a highly complicated model which we can not hope to be able to solve in a simple manner .",
    "however , as we discuss in this section , we can write down an approximating model which in a certain limit reproduces the large @xmath0 sqcd . using this trick , we , in particular , will be able to find the exact solutions for the shapes of the domain walls in the large @xmath0 sqcd .      as in section [ prelim ] ,",
    "let us consider @xmath1 gauge theory with @xmath2 gauge group and @xmath0 flavors @xmath31 , @xmath32 ( @xmath33 . the non - perturbative superpotential in this theory is given by ( [ qm ] ) .",
    "next , let us add a tree - level superpotential of the following form : @xmath109 here @xmath64 is a chiral superfield neutral under the @xmath2 gauge group .",
    "note that the first term in this superpotential corresponds to giving mass @xmath110 to all @xmath0 flavors . for @xmath111 , at energy scales below @xmath110 we can integrate the heavy flavors out .",
    "this leaves us with sqcd without matter whose gaugino condensate is controlled by the vev of @xmath64 .",
    "thus , the effective superpotential reads @xmath112 the gaugino condensate is given by @xmath113 in other words , if @xmath110 is large compared with @xmath39 everywhere , then the gaugino condensate in this model is a linear function of @xmath64 . by computing bps configurations in this model , we would therefore be effectively computing the spatial dependence of the gaugino condensate .",
    "how is this model related to our starting point , namely , sqcd without matter ?",
    "first , let us discuss the vacuum structure of this theory .",
    "the f - flatness condition @xmath66 has @xmath0 solutions .",
    "however , this will have no impact on the following discussions since all the configurations of interest here involve @xmath114 . ]",
    "( for definiteness here we choose @xmath115 to be positive ) : @xmath116 where @xmath117 .",

    "there are domain walls between different vacua .",

    "this follows from our discussion in the previous section , and the fact that this model is nothing but the @xmath102 model when viewed from the two dimensional @xmath19 quantum field theory viewpoint .",
    "thus , this approximating model resembles sqcd . however , there are also differences .",
    "first , the theory contains heavy quarks with masses of order @xmath119 . in order to be able to approach sqcd",
    ", we therefore must take the limit @xmath120 .",
    "naively , this might appear to be enough to map this model to sqcd .",
    "this is , however , not the case . to see this ,",
    "consider the value of the superpotential for a given vacuum : @xmath121 thus , the relation which would be correct in sqcd , namely , @xmath122 is reproduced only in the limit @xmath123 .",
    "( this is required to get the same central charges as in sqcd . )",
    "so we must also take t hooft s large @xmath0 limit .",
    "in fact , we will see in the following that the two limits , namely , @xmath120 and @xmath123 , are not independent .",
    "the precise relation between these limits ( that is , which combination of @xmath124 and @xmath0 needs to be kept fixed ) will become clear in subsection d. here we note that in this limit the mass of the field @xmath64 in any given vacuum @xmath125 is infinitely large , so that this model indeed reproduces large @xmath0 sqcd .",
    "however , for the domain wall solution interpolating between two distinct vacua @xmath125 and @xmath126 there is a zero mode of @xmath64 localized on the wall .",

    "however , at large @xmath0 there are certain simplifications .",
    "in particular , consider the energy @xmath163 of the corresponding solitons in the two dimensional quantum field theory . for @xmath155 as @xmath123",
    "we have @xmath164 .",
    "this implies that at large @xmath0 the corresponding solitons fall apart into @xmath18 `` elementary '' solitons the solutions with @xmath162 can be viewed as `` bound states '' of `` elementary '' solitons with @xmath14 which become infinitely separated as @xmath123 . ] . in the four dimensional language , at large @xmath0 the domain walls with @xmath13 , @xmath162 , fall apart into @xmath18 `` elementary '' domain walls . in the following",
    "we argue that this is consistent with the interpretation of the `` elementary '' domain walls as d - branes for the sqcd string . on the other hand , for finite",
    "@xmath0 we have @xmath165 .",
    "this is , however , a subleading effect in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "we therefore conclude that the domain walls with @xmath162 are stable ( in the sense that they do not fall apart into `` elementary '' domain walls ) only at finite @xmath0 .    to address the above issue in more detail , let us consider the domain walls with @xmath153 more carefully .",
    "let us parametrize @xmath64 as @xmath157 .",
    "then the boundary conditions on @xmath130 read : @xmath166 , @xmath167 . the bps equation ( [ bps1 ] ) then reads : @xmath168~.\\ ] ] here we have introduced @xmath169 note that @xmath170 .",
    "suppose there is a bps solution such that @xmath171 for @xmath71 taking values in some finite interval .",
    "by this me mean that @xmath172 as @xmath123 for these values of @xmath71 .",
    "thus , we can try the following anstz ( whose self - consistency is to be verified ) for solving the bps equation ( [ bps ] ) : @xmath173 where it is assumed that @xmath174 for @xmath175 , and @xmath176 for @xmath177 .",
    "the solution to the above anstz is given by @xmath178 where @xmath179 , and @xmath180 here @xmath181 is arbitrary .",
    "note that there are constraints for the validity of the above solution .",
    "first , we must consider the `` edge '' effects .",
    "namely , for @xmath182 , and @xmath183 , where @xmath184 , we have @xmath185 . now suppose that as @xmath123 we have @xmath16 , where @xmath17 .",
    "then the assumption @xmath172 as @xmath123 breaks down at distances @xmath186",
    ". now recall that @xmath152 is the width of the `` elementary '' domain walls .",
    "thus , for @xmath16 , @xmath17 , the above solutions would break down due to the `` edge '' effects at distances ( from the `` edge '' ) which are much greater than the width of the `` elementary '' domain walls .",
    "this implies that the correct description of the domain walls with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , appears to be in terms of @xmath18 `` elementary '' domain walls ( separated by large distances ) rather than as solitons of the large @xmath0 sqcd string .    next , consider the domain walls with @xmath15 in the large @xmath0 limit",
    ". for such domain walls the `` edge '' effects become important at distances @xmath187 .",
    "thus , the above solution for such domain walls can be trusted for all @xmath71 except for the small regions near the `` edges '' .",
    "the size of these regions is of order @xmath152 , that is , the width of the `` elementary '' domain wall .",
    "this implies that the domain walls with @xmath15 can be viewed as solitons of the sqcd string provided that @xmath188 is finite and , therefore , the width of the `` elementary '' domain walls ( _ i.e. _ , the width of the d - branes ) is vanishing in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "before we end this subsection , we point out the second restriction on the validity of the above solution for the @xmath15 domain walls interpreted as solitons of the sqcd string .",
    "the following restriction has to do with the fact the approximating model we have been using is strictly speaking valid only if @xmath189 . in the above solution we have @xmath190 . on the other hand , it is not difficult to see that @xmath191 this expression vanishes for @xmath192 ( which is possible for even @xmath0 ) , and can be arbitrarily small for @xmath193 in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "it is not difficult to see that under these circumstances @xmath194 for @xmath195 , where @xmath196 . in the next subsection",
    "we will see that in the appropriate limit @xmath197 .",
    "this implies that the above `` soliton '' solutions for @xmath15 can be trusted everywhere in the large @xmath0 limit up to the `` edge '' effects due to the d - branes , and ( possible ) `` core '' effects due to the quarks @xmath198 becoming too light .",
    "( these effects , however , are negligible as they affect the solution only in infinitesimally small regions . )",
    "the above discussion leads us to the following picture .",
    "the width of the soliton solutions with @xmath15 is of order @xmath199 . in sqcd",
    "we expect this to be of order @xmath200 , where @xmath5 is the dynamically generated scale of sqcd .",
    "note that this is also consistent with the fact that @xmath201 , where @xmath202 is the sqcd string length . (",
    "the sqcd string tension is expected to be @xmath203 . )",
    "then the width of the `` elementary '' domain walls , interpreted as d - branes for the ( open ) sqcd strings , is of order @xmath204 , which is vanishing for finite @xmath188 .",
    "this is consistent with the ( at least naive ) expectation that in a weakly coupled string theory d - branes have vanishing width .",
    "another important point is that the domain walls with @xmath162 appear to fall apart into @xmath18 d - branes ( separated by large distances ) unless @xmath205 is a finite number as @xmath206 .",
    "this is important for two reasons .",
    "thus , had we found additional domain walls with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , we would definitely have a puzzle since the tension for these domain walls would go as @xmath207 .",
    "second , it appears that we _ can not _ stack d - branes on top of each other .",
    "this is consistent with the rest of the above picture , since had we been able to do so , we would have to have a moduli space associated with the positions of d - branes .",
    "these would have to be described by adjoint scalars in the effective field theory .",
    "however , we do not expect any such adjoint scalars in this model due to @xmath1 supersymmetry in @xmath208 dimensions ( in the world - volumes of the d - branes - see the next section ) .",
    "so the above conclusions seem to be consistent with this fact as well .",
    "we are now ready to determine the precise limit that we ought to take to recover ( the large @xmath0 ) sqcd consistent with the above discussions .",
    "first , we conclude that we must have @xmath209 . on the other hand , the gaugino condensate @xmath210 . according to our discussion in section [ prelim ]",
    ", we must have @xmath211 .",
    "thus , we have two relations : @xmath212 this implies that we must take the following limit : @xmath213 here @xmath214 is a finite number .",
    "( note that @xmath5 is fixed to a finite value . )",
    "however , we must actually have @xmath215 ( that is , @xmath216 ) so that the procedure of integrating out the heavy quarks @xmath198 is valid .",
    "we note that in this limit the above model is a valid description as far as the `` elementary '' domain walls are concerned , that is , none of the assumptions ( such as , say , validity of integrating out the heavy quarks ) on which it was built break down .",
    "in particular , note that the change in the absolute value of @xmath64 through the walls corresponding to the d - branes is subleading in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "thus , the inequality @xmath111 always holds . also , the masses of the heavy quarks @xmath198 ( which we have integrated out ) are of order @xmath217 . on the other hand ,",
    "the width of the d - branes is of order @xmath152 , and we have @xmath218 .",
    "this implies that integrating out these heavy quarks is completely legitimate .",
    "the above picture appears to be consistent with the arguments of @xcite as well as various discussions in the previous sections .",
    "however , if we are to interpret some of the large @xmath0 domain walls as d - branes , we expect ( at least naively ) that there should be a @xmath20 gauge field living in the world - volume of such a d - brane @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we expect a three dimensional @xmath1 @xmath20 gauge supermultiplet localized on the d - brane .",
    "can we identify such a supermultiplet in the above picture ?",
    "this is where the zero modes of the chiral superfield @xmath64 in the above approximating model find a natural interpretation .",
    "note that in the above limit the mass of the field @xmath64 in any given vacuum @xmath125 is infinitely large .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation of the approximating model as reducing to the large @xmath0 sqcd ( where in any given vacuum we do not expect additional singlet fields ) .",
    "however , for the solution describing a domain wall separating two distinct vacua @xmath125 and @xmath126 there always exist zero modes of @xmath64 localized on the domain wall corresponding to the goldstone modes of broken translational invariance and supersymmetry .",
    "more precisely , since @xmath64 in the four dimensional @xmath1 supersymmetric theory is a chiral superfield containing a ( two - component ) chiral fermion and a complex boson , the corresponding zero modes ( corresponding to a bps solution that breaks half of the supersymmetries ) consist of a one - component fermion and a real scalar in three dimensions .",
    "these form an @xmath1 `` chiral '' supermultiplet in three dimensions . however , in three dimensions this is dual to a @xmath20 vector supermultiplet consisting of a vector boson ( with one physical degree of freedom ) plus its @xmath1 superpartner .",
    "this is due to the fact that a @xmath20 vector boson in three dimensions can be dualized into a real scalar .",
    "thus , for the domain walls corresponding to the d - branes the zero modes of @xmath64 are interpreted ( in the dual `` magnetic '' picture ) as the @xmath20 gauge supermultiplet living in the ( @xmath208 dimensional ) world - volume of the d - brane .",
    "let us discuss the zero modes localized on a d - brane in a bit more detail . for simplicity ,",
    "let us confine our attention to the bosonic zero mode .",
    "( the fermionic zero mode can be obtained by the corresponding supersymmetry transformation . )",
    "thus , consider the domain wall separating two vacua @xmath125 and @xmath127 .",
    "let @xmath100 be the corresponding bps solution .",
    "then the zero mode is given by : @xmath219 here @xmath220 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that for this d - brane solution the zero mode is localized in the region of the size @xmath152 which is the same as the width of the d - brane .",
    "( recall that in the limit we are taking here this width is vanishingly small . )",
    "then according to the above discussion the bosonic and fermionic zero modes correspond to the three dimensional @xmath1 @xmath20 gauge supermultiplet localized in the world - volume of the d - brane .    here",
    "the following remarks are in order .",
    "first , note that the above zero modes correspond to the translations in the direction transverse to the d - brane . on the other hand",
    ", the change in the absolute value of @xmath64 through the corresponding domain wall is subleading in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "thus , the zero mode is related to the change in the phase of @xmath64 .",
    "the latter is periodic , so that the dualization procedure ( to a @xmath20 gauge multiplet ) leads to quantization of the corresponding @xmath20 charge .",
    "second , at low energies we expect a _ free _ @xmath20 gauge multiplet localized on the d - brane .",
    "this requires that the dual scalar also be free .",
    "this is guaranteed by the fact that here we have a goldstone mode ( of broken translational invariance in the @xmath71-direction ) with purely derivative interactions suppressed by the wall tension .",
    "( the corresponding interactions involving the fermionic component follow by the @xmath1 supersymmetry transformation in three dimensions . ) in particular , at low energies the theory is indeed free .    thus , consider the low energy effective field theory corresponding to the zero modes of @xmath64 localized on the d - brane .",
    "in particular , let us discuss the bosonic part of the corresponding low energy lagrangian , namely , let us only keep the terms arising through the induced metric @xmath221 on the wall : @xmath222 where @xmath223 .",
    "( here @xmath224 is the three dimensional minkowskian metric , and we have normalized the field @xmath225 so that @xmath226 is dimensionless . ) on the other hand , we have the following vector - scalar duality transformation in @xmath208 dimensions ( @xmath227 ) : @xmath228 here @xmath229 is the @xmath20 field strength , @xmath230 is the vector potential , and @xmath225 is the dual scalar . the lagrangian in ( [ el ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath231 this is nothing but the born - infeld lagrangian for a @xmath20 gauge field ( as expected for the low energy effective lagrangian of a d - brane ) . at low energies",
    "it reduces to the free maxwell theory in @xmath208 dimensions : @xmath232 here @xmath233 has conventional dimension of mass squared ( whereas @xmath234 is dimensionless ) .",
    "the @xmath20 gauge coupling is given by : @xmath235 where @xmath236 is the d - brane tension .",
    "let us briefly summarize the main points in the previous discussions .",
    "we consider an approximating model which in a particular limit reduces to the large @xmath0 sqcd .",
    "this model is constructed by starting from @xmath1 @xmath2 gauge theory with @xmath0 flavors plus a gauge singlet .",
    "the tree - level superpotential corresponds to the chiral @xmath28 symmetry breaking with all the flavors acquiring large masses .",
    "there are @xmath0 inequivalent vacua in this model . in a particular limit where the vev of the gauge singlet is large , and @xmath123 , this theory reduces to the large @xmath0 sqcd without matter in which we have gaugino condensate .",
    "the inequivalent vacua then correspond to different phases @xmath237 , @xmath238 of the gaugino condensate .    using our approximating model , we then are able to solve for the exact shapes of the domain walls ( separating the vacua labeled by @xmath11 and @xmath13 , @xmath239 ) in the large @xmath0 sqcd .",
    "these exact solutions are obtained in a certain coordinate system which depends on the khler metric ( which we assume to be non - singular ) . in particular",
    ", we find that there are two basic types of solutions .",
    "the first type corresponds to the `` elementary '' domain walls with @xmath14 .",
    "these are interpreted as d - branes of the corresponding large @xmath0 sqcd string .",
    "the tension of these domain walls goes as @xmath60 ( with the appropriate choice of the subtraction scheme dictated by the requirement that all domain walls have proper interpretation in the sqcd string context , which , in particular , implies that the gaugino condensate @xmath211 ) .",
    "the second type of domain walls occur for @xmath15 .",
    "these are interpreted as solitons of the corresponding large @xmath0 sqcd string .",
    "the tension of these domain walls goes as @xmath240 . for other values of @xmath18 the corresponding domain walls ( in the large @xmath0 limit )",
    "appear to be described as configurations composed of @xmath18 `` elementary '' domain walls ( d - branes ) separated by distances large compared with the d - brane width .",
    "( the latter is of order @xmath241 .",
    "in contrast , the solitons have finite width of order @xmath200 . )",
    "we have also argued that the zero mode ( corresponding to the singlet @xmath64 ) localized in the world - volume of a d - brane is dual to the @xmath1 @xmath20 vector supermultiplet in @xmath208 dimensions .",
    "open sqcd strings should be able to end on these d - branes . then , these d - branes support excitations that behave as if they transform in the fundamental of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "in other words , as far as the quantum numbers are concerned , the region where the sqcd string ( _ i.e. _ , the chromo - electric flux tube ) enters the d - brane looks like a state in the fundamental of @xmath2 .",
    "this simply follows from the flux conservation .",
    "the above discussions appear to imply that whatever the sqcd string theory is , it must contain d - branes and open strings as well as ( expected ) closed strings . here",
    "one can draw an analogy with type ii string theory which perturbatively contains only the closed string states , but must be augmented with d - branes and open string sectors to describe non - perturbative phenomena .",
    "in fact , in the sqcd string theory it seems to be necessary to include the open strings and d - branes ( in the large @xmath0 limit ) .",
    "these states are _ not _ solitons of the effective closed string theory , but must be introduced or else phenomena such as chiral symmetry breaking and appearance of ( some of ) the domain walls can not be described . at present",
    "it is unclear what this sqcd string theory is .",
    "however , we do expect that it is a non - critical string theory with varying string tension @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to understand the role of d - branes in such string theories .",
    "this might shed additional light on the structure of sqcd .",
    "finally , we would like to make the following comment .",
    "the particular approximating model we used in this paper for our discussion of domain walls in the large @xmath0 sqcd is not the only possible starting point .",
    "thus , one can equally successfully start from , say , @xmath1 @xmath2 gauge theory with one flavor with a large mass . upon integrating out this heavy flavor we obtain sqcd .",
    "then the domain walls can be studied much in the same way as we did in this paper .",
    "( in fact , this was the setup used in @xcite to study domain walls in the case of @xmath242 . ) the resulting domain walls ( for large @xmath0 ) are bps saturated , and their shapes in the coordinate system where the corresponding khler metric is eliminated are related to those obtained in this paper by an appropriate diffeomorphism accompanied by a ( non - linear ) change of variables ( which changes the khler potential ) .",
    "the final answer is , however , the same .",
    "one should also be able to start from the effective veneziano - yankielowicz superpotential @xcite . in this case",
    "the corresponding two dimensional @xmath19 quantum field theory reduces to the @xmath243 model .",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite for a discussion of this model . )",
    "generically , ( unless the `` glue - ball '' field becomes too small ) this description should also be adequate .",
    "here we should mention that there is a technical problem with using the effective veneziano - yankielowicz superpotential , namely , a logarithmic branch cut appearing in the superpotential .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether one can obtain domain wall shapes in this approach and map them to those discussed in this paper via the appropriate diffeomorphism plus change of variables .",
