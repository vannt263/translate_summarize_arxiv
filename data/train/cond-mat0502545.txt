    "fluid membranes occur in a wide variety of physical , chemical , and biological systems @xcite .",
    "examples include surfactant films , uni - lamellar and multi - lamellar vesicles , and lipid bilayer membranes , such as those in biological cells .",
    "increased attention has been paid to the properties of multi - component bilayer membranes .",
    "there are at least two important reasons for this . on the one hand ,",
    "biological cell membranes naturally involve mixtures of several different lipid and protein components @xcite .",
    "processes such as budding , shape and textural transformations , and raft formation are believed to involve local inhomogeneities in these mixtures @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "lipid mixtures have been shown to play an important role in the formation of stable vesicles for a variety of potential biomedical applications such as controlled gene and drug delivery @xcite .",
    "the additional internal degrees of freedom that accompany the presence of two or more components within a fluid membrane can lead to a rich set of different membrane properties .",
    "the understanding of the effects of composition variations on membrane properties is important , as it may shed light on the behavior of cell membranes , and also enable rational control of synthetic membrane structure and function .",
    "the compositional degrees of freedom in a multi - component membrane can dramatically influence both its morphology and phase behavior .",
    "for instance , phase separation within the membrane can occur , analogous to phase separation of ordinary fluids .",
    "however , such two - dimensional phase separation within a membrane is expected to be closely linked with the three - dimensional shape of the membrane .",
    "this is because , at a microscopic level , the curvature properties , and especially the spontaneous curvature , are largely dictated by the structure of the constituent molecules  @xcite .",
    "thus , regions of different composition will often have different curvature properties .",
    "in such cases , the formation of a domain of one phase within a matrix of another phase can lead to a localized deformation of the membrane .",
    "this deformation can be enhanced by finite line tension between domains , which when sufficiently large can drive budding ( the formation and subsequent separation of a small vesicle ) .",
    "experimental studies of model two and three component systems have examined domain formation  @xcite and its role in the process of membrane shape transformations  @xcite and budding  @xcite .",
    "many theoretical studies have examined the interplay between internal degrees of freedom and membrane shape in two - component fluid membranes  @xcite . in theoretical studies of phase - separated bilayer vesicles , it was found that budding can occur in the limit of large line tension between the two phases  @xcite .",
    "however , when surface tension is relevant , phase separation can lead to stable , modulated phases of flat films and vesicles @xcite .",
    "indeed , equilibrium modulated morphologies have been observed in several recent studies of phase - separated multi - component bilayer vesicles  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the deformation of homogeneously mixed two - component fluid membranes may induce in - plane phase separation@xcite .    for a mixed monolayer ,",
    "the deformation of the film due to phase separation of two components with differing spontaneous curvature is an immediate consequence of the different molecular architectures of the two components . for a bilayer membrane , however , the coupling of composition to curvature is somewhat more subtle because of symmetry considerations .",
    "phase separation can take two different forms within a bilayer membrane . as shown in fig .",
    "[ pics](a ) , a symmetric domain of one component can develop within a matrix of another phase . in fig .",
    "[ pics](b ) , an asymmetric domain is shown , in which the two halves of the bilayer have different compositions . as illustrated in the figure , these effects can influence the shapes and phase behavior of membranes in different ways . in the symmetric case [ fig .",
    "[ pics](a ) ] , the domain can remain flat @xcite although the domain can be more or less rigid than the surrounding membrane , a situation reminiscent of rafts in biological membranes . however , composition inhomogeneities can give rise to deformation of a bilayer membrane if there is an asymmetric distribution of the lipid constituents across the bilayer , as shown in fig .",
    "[ pics](b ) @xcite .",
    "such lipid asymmetry has been clearly demonstrated experimentally in biological membranes @xcite .",
    "this broken symmetry of the bilayer can either arise spontaneously @xcite or as a result of different environments on the inside and outside of a vesicle . in the latter case",
    ", we must also consider the possibility of a non - zero surface tension due to an osmotic pressure difference between the inside and outside .        in this paper",
    ", we examine the stability and equilibrium shapes of domains in asymptotically flat fluid films ( or giant vesicles with dimensions much larger than the domain sizes ) .",
    "we focus on domains of constituents with finite effective spontaneous curvature , embedded in a matrix of membrane material with zero spontaneous curvature .",
    "these domains can either be due to phase separation of two or more components in a mixed membrane , or to the inclusion of an `` impurity '' in the film ( such as a membrane protein or a surface adsorbed macromolecule ) @xcite .",
    "we show that for membranes under tension , stable protruding circular domains ( we call these _ caplets _ , as in refs",
    ".  @xcite ) similar to those observed for mixtures of lecithin and phosphatitic acid @xcite can occur at low concentrations of the minority component or impurity .",

    "we note the excellent agreement of this phase boundary with that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] , at least for @xmath141 . for larger @xmath127",
    "the former approximations fail .",
    "one consequence of this is that the stripe phase vanishes with increasing @xmath127 : specifically , there is a narrow range of values of the line tension for which the only stable domains are caplets .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ regimes ] .",
    "the simple physical reason for the enhanced stability of the caplet phase ( compared with the small - slope results above ) in this limit is that the line tension cost is lowered in the caplet geometry for large slopes , given a fixed domain area : for caplets , the circumference to area ratio is reduced with increasing slope .    also shown in fig .",
    "[ regimes ] is the transition between caplet and bud states , as well as a spinodal line beyond which no stable caplet structures are possible .",
    "no spinodal representing the limit of metastability of buds is found .",
    "this is an artifact of the use of a bending free energy using only leading order terms .",
    "such a spinodal depends on the details , and especially the radius @xmath142 of the neck in the budded state . without further assumptions , this length shrinks to of order @xmath143 .",
    "the surface tension required to pull - out such a bud is of order the two dimensional laplace `` pressure '' @xmath144 , which diverges for small necks .",
    "thus , this spinodal can not be reliably determined , if at all , by our numerical scheme . within the approximation that the neck of the budded state shrinks to a size much smaller than the domain size",
    ", we find that buds are , in fact , metastable throughout the phase diagram .",
    "this is because , for small necks , there is a linear increase in the free energy due to the line tension when the neck expands , while both bending and surface tension contributions are quadratic .",
    "the remaining phase boundary shown in fig .",
    "[ regimes ] is that of the transition from the flat phase ( macro phase separation ) to the budded state .",
    "this phase boundary is simple to estimate .",
    "the free energy per unit area of the bud is simply @xmath145 , while the bud accounts for an excess area of @xmath146 , assuming an optimal mean curvature of @xmath10 .",
    "as noted above , the radius of the neck tends to zero .",
    "this results in a phase boundary given by @xmath147 in reduced units .",
    "this simple phase boundary estimate is well borne out by the numerical minimization , as shown in the figure .    .",
    "the solid lines indicate thermodynamic phase boundaries , while the dashed line indicates the limit of metastability of caplets .",
    "as discussed in the text , we expect that buds are metastable throughout the phase diagram , within the approximations used here .",
    "the thin region shown is that of the stripe phase .",
    "this vanishes at a triple point near @xmath148 .",
    "the bud , caplet , and flat phases meet at the other triple point along @xmath149 .",
    "upper and right hand axes are dimensionless , while lower and left hand axes are in physical units for typical values of the bending energy and spontaneous curvature , @xmath150 . ]",
    "the transition from caplets to stripes with increasing @xmath100 and @xmath96 can be understood in simple physical terms . on the one hand , with increasing @xmath100 the unit cells in the stripe and caplet morphologies are of size @xmath151 and @xmath152 , respectively .",
    "thus , with increasing @xmath100 , the constraints on the membrane profiles due to the unit cell boundaries become more costly in the caplet phase than the stripe phase . on the other hand , with increasing tension @xmath96 , the regions of largest slope (",
    "i.e. , largest difference between projected area and membrane area ) , which occur near the domain boundaries , become energetically more costly because of the work required against tension . for caplets ,",
    "this represents a larger fraction of the domain area than for stripes .",
    "thus , stripes are preferred for sufficiently large @xmath96 .    from the numerical approach of the previous section , we see ,",
    "perhaps surprisingly , that the monge approximation works rather well to describe the various phases and transitions . specifically , we see from fig .",
    "[ scaling ] that for @xmath141 there is little disagreement between the monge approximation and the numerical solutions that can account for finite slopes .",
    "this is particularly true of the caplet phase .    in general",
    ", we expect the monge approximation to be best for large @xmath137 , which tends to flatten the membrane .",
    "since the phase boundaries between caplets , stripes , and the flat phase tend to occur for a fixed @xmath153 ( specifically @xmath154 and @xmath94 for the caplet - stripe and stripe - flat boundaries , respectively , in the dilute limit ) , we expect the monge approximation to be valid near both transitions , except for large @xmath32 , which is what we find . here",
    ", of course , @xmath34 tends to be smaller .    as noted above , however , the discrepancy is smaller for the caplet phase .",
    "the deviation that we find for stripes suggests an instability toward larger domains and , ultimately , the flat phase .",
    "this tends to be compensated in the case of caplets by the line tension @xmath32 , which prevents domains from growing .",
    "this enhanced stability of caplets is also consistent with the observation from the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ regimes ] that the caplet - stripe phase boundary shifts in favor of caplets as @xmath32 increases .",
    "we find , in fact , a triple point , where caplet , stripe and flat phases meet , although this is hard to see in the figure . for larger @xmath32 , no stripe phase is observed .",
    "away from these transitions , however , we begin to see significant deviation from the monge results for the largest @xmath32 as sigma decreases .",
    "thus , the monge approximation tends to fail to the left in fig .",
    "[ regimes ] . in particular , the monge approximation is insufficient to characterize the transition between buds and caplets .",
    "this work shares some common features with several previous theoretical studies .",
    "undulating stripe and hexagonal phases were predicted in the limit of weakly segregated two - component films @xcite based on a phenomenological coupling of local membrane composition and shape .",
    "these phases are analogous to the stripe and caplet phases discussed in this letter for well - segregated mixtures .",
    "the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite has recently been utilized to study one - dimensional shape profiles of two - component membranes and vesicles in the strong segregation regime as well @xcite .",
    "the stripe phases of planar membranes in the limit of small domains or large bending energies reported in ref.@xcite are qualitatively similar to our stripe mesophases",
    ". the stable stripe and caplet mesophases reported in this letter should occur in phase - separated two - component films under tension , provided that one phase has finite spontaneous curvature and that the line and surface tensions are sufficiently small . in particular , one must have @xmath155 and @xmath156 to observe these mesophases .",
    "the calculation presented above assumes an asymptotically flat matrix phase , as in the case of a globally flat monolayer or bilayer membrane",
    ". however , our results should be qualitatively valid for two - component bilayer vesicles , provided that the vesicle diameter @xmath157 is sufficiently large compared with the characteristic domain dimension , _",
    "i.e. _ , if @xmath158 .",
    "gd and gompper performed a similar calculation to ours in a different `` slice '' of parameter space .",
    "they considered phases with _ different _ signs of spontaneous curvature , and predicted a variety of different budding , stripe , and circular domains .",
    "it is difficult to compare the results directly , since they chose only one parameter set , @xmath159 . for our model , with just one spontaneous curvature , this leads to a budded state .",
    "they show that this set of parameters can lead to a variety of phases that can be stabilized by the different spontaneous curvatures .",
    "we estimate the region of domain stability for the following values of the parameters in our model : @xmath160 the results are shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ regimes ] .",
    "thus , caplet domains of order @xmath161 in size ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) are stable for line tensions @xmath162 and surface tensions @xmath163 . for comparison ,",
    "membrane rupture occurs for surface tensions of order @xmath164 @xcite .",
    "finally , we wish to note a couple of important general observation relevant to phase separating membrane systems .",
    "first , given the coupling between membrane composition and shape , it is possible to have both composition - induced changes in shape or curvature @xcite , as well as curvature - induced changes in composition @xcite . however , unless the curvature is of a molecular scale ( _ i.e. _ , if curvature radii are comparable to the size @xmath142 of a single lipid ) , it is generally expected that composition will drive shape , or , in other words , that chemistry determines geometry .",
    "this is because , on a per molecule basis , the curvature energy @xmath165 is very small compared with @xmath166 . thus ,",
    "unless one happens to be very close to a critical point @xcite , the shift in chemical potential due to the local curvature of the membrane is expected to be insufficient to cause a significant composition change .",
    "second , the gaussian curvature and associated modulus @xmath167 , which we have so far neglected , is expected to affect the stability of the caplet and budded phases described above .",
    "in fact , this can have an order one effect on both phases , since the corresponding shift on the curvature energy is of order @xmath168 per unit area , where @xmath169 represents the difference in moduli between the two phases .",
    "this is comparable to the ( mean ) curvature energy contribution in both phases .",
    "there will be no effect , however on the stripe phase free energy .",
    "thus , the main qualitative effect of taking into account the gaussian curvature effects will be on the stability of the bud and caplet phases relative to the stripe phase .",
    "for instance , the expected increase or decrease in the energy of bud and caplet phases may result in a more pronounced or even absent stripe .",
    "finally , we have imposed the strong segregation limit , in which the compositions of the two phases are unaffected by the local bending .",
    "this is likely to break down near critical points , at which point the compositions will vary in concert with the degree of bending @xcite . in this case",
    "the local line tension can be expected to be lower and depend on the degree of local membrane deformation . moreover",
    ", elastic constants and the spontaneous curvature will be inhomogeneous in the more highly deformed regions .",
    "possible effects of this could be to stabilize the caplet phase in favor of the stripe phase ( since line tension may be reduced ) , as well as shifting other phase boundaries .",
    "however , as we have emphasized above , the strong segregation limit is expected to apply more generally , because of the wide separation of scales between the molecular and curvature lengths .",
