    "the two most powerful fr  ii radio sources in the nearby universe ",
    "cyg  a and 3c295  are each located at the centre of a dense , moderately rich cluster of galaxies . while such an environment is exceptional for a low - redshift fr  ii galaxy , it appears to be common around powerful radio objects at earlier epochs . above a redshift of 0.5 ,",
    "radio - loud objects ( both the quasars and radio galaxies ) are inferred to lie in clusters of galaxies of moderate optical richness .",
    "the evidence for such an environment includes optical and near - ir galaxy counts ( yee & green 1987 ; yates et al 1989 ; hill & lilly 1991 ; ellingson et al 1991 ; dickinson 1997 ) , high gas pressures within a radius of 30   ( crawford & fabian 1989 ; forbes et al 1990 ; bremer et al 1992 ; durret et al 1994 ) , cd - type host galaxy profiles ( best et al 1998 ) , a gravitational arc ( deltorn et al 1997 ) , and lensing shear of surrounding field galaxies ( bower & smail 1997 ) . the properties of the radio source itself also imply the presence of a confining medium : a large - scale working surface on which the jets form the radio lobes ; a steep radio spectrum ; and a high minimum pressure in regions of relaxed radio structure ( bremer et al 1992 ) . a faraday depolarization asymmetry ( garrington & conway 1991 ) , the distortion and compression of high - redshift radio source morphologies ( hintzen et al 1983 ; barthel & miley 1988 ) and sources with very high faraday rotation measures ( carilli et al 1994 ; carilli et al 1997 ) all corroborate the inference of a dense , clumpy medium surrounding the radio source .",
    "thus it appears that the deepest potential wells we can readily pinpoint at @xmath1 are those around powerful radio sources .    the cluster distribution at high redshift can provide a stringent cosmological test ( see e.g. donahue et al 1998 ) , and",
    "can also be compared to the x - ray luminosity function of clusters at low redshift ( eg ebeling et al 1997 ) . whilst it may result in a sample of clusters biased to only those that can host an active nucleus , using radio sources to identify",
    "the location of deep potential wells is a promising way of finding clusters out to and beyond a redshift @xmath2 ( crawford 1997 ) .",
    "current x - ray surveys of clusters detected from the rosat all - sky survey ( eg ebeling et al 1998 ) do not reach sufficiently faint flux levels , and studies of deep serendipitous x - ray pointings ( e.g. rosati et al 1998 ) cover only a small fraction of the sky .",
    "the first step , however , is simply to confirm that powerful radio quasars beyond a redshift of a half really do lie at the centre of clusters of galaxies .",
    "the clearest way to determine directly the presence of a cluster of galaxies is to detect thermal x - ray emission from its hot intracluster medium .",
    "a certain degree of success has been achieved in detecting and spatially resolving the x - ray emission around distant ( @xmath3 ) radio galaxies using rosat ( crawford & fabian 1993 ; worrall 1994 ; crawford & fabian 1995a , 1996a , b ; crawford 1997 ; dickinson 1997 ; hardcastle , lawrence & worrall 1998 ; carilli et al 1998 ) .",
    "any x - rays emitted by the central bright nucleus of radio galaxies are assumed to be absorbed along the line of sight , as observed for the powerful low - redshift radio galaxy cygnus - a ( ueno et al 1994 ) .",
    "the inferred bolometric luminosity of the x - ray sources associated with the radio galaxies is @xmath4 , easily compatible with that expected from moderately rich clusters of galaxies around the radio sources .",
    "there could also be a contribution to the extended x - ray emission from inverse compton scattering of the hidden quasar radiation ( eg brunetti , setti & comastri 1997 ) .",
    "in the case of radio quasars , however , the x - ray detection of the spatially extended environment is complicated by the presence of bright spatially - unresolved x - ray emission from the active nucleus .",
    "the rosat pspc did not combine the necessary sensitivity with a sufficiently good point - response function , needed to both detect and resolve any cluster emission around quasars .",
    "upper limits of @xmath5(in the 0.1 - 2.4  rest - frame band ) to x - ray emission from the environment of three radio - loud quasars have been derived from rosat hri data ( hall et al 1995 , 1997 ) assuming the cluster emission profile is modelled by a king law .",
    "we have also obtained rosat hri data to spatially resolve and detect the extended emission from the intracluster medium around each of a small sample of intermediate - redshift radio - loud quasars .",
    "the detection of such a component is , however , complicated by the wobble of the spacecraft during the observation .",
    "this occurs on a @xmath6  s period , and when the attitude of the spacecraft is not well reconstructed , leads to smearing of the point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the bright emission from the quasar nucleus can then contaminate the outer regions where we hope to detect emission from any surrounding cluster , and this has so far hindered our progress in interpreting the data . in this paper , however , we present an analysis of our rosat hri data taken of seven intermediate - redshift ( 0.1@xmath70.8 ) radio - loud quasars , which employs a new correction for the spacecraft wobble derived by harris et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "a contemporaneous and independent analysis of an overlapping dataset using this technique has been carried out by hardcastle & worrall ( 1999 ) , who obtain similar results .",
    "we use the rosat data of intermediate - redshift , radio - loud quasars for which there is prior evidence from other wavebands for a cluster environment ( see notes on individual quasars for details ) .",
    "we preferentially selected quasars of only moderate x - ray luminosity in order to minimise the contrast between the nuclear emission and any cluster emission .",
    "these targets were supplemented by data available from the rosat public archive on 3c273 and 3c215 .",
    "we also include the observations of h1821 + 643 to form a comparison to the results of hall etal ( 1997 ) .",
    "the observations used , and details of the quasars are listed in table  [ tab : obslog ] .    .target sample and results [ tab : obslog ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + notes : + @xmath8 is the x - ray luminosity of the extended component within the break radius @xmath9 , and is assumed to be due to a cooling flow in the cluster .",
    "+ is the derived mass cooling rate within radius @xmath9 .",
    "+ @xmath10 is the cooling time at radius @xmath9 .",
    "+ @xmath11 is the gas pressure at a radius of 30  from the centre of the cluster .",
    "+ @xmath12 is the electron density at radius @xmath9 .",
    "we plot the average bolometric luminosity of the extended cluster component ( from table  [ tab : averages ] ) against quasar redshift in figure  [ fig : lxz ] .",
    "for comparison we plot the bolometric luminosity of the x - ray source associated with the distant radio galaxies 3c277.2 , 3c294 , 3c324 , 3c356 , 3c368 ( from crawford & fabian 1996b ) and 1138 - 262 ( carilli et al 1998 ) , and the clusters surrounding the two nearby fr  ii radio galaxies cygnus  a ( ueno et al 1994 ) and 3c295 ( henry & henriksen 1986 ) .",
    "the observed countrates of the distant radio galaxies have been converted to luminosities assuming the same 4  thermal bremsstrahlung model used to obtain luminosities for the quasar extended emission .",
    "the luminosities we have derived for the environment of our quasars are brighter than the upper limits of 1.6 ",
    "3.5@xmath13(rest - frame 0.1 - 2.4 ) to any cluster emission surrounding three radio - loud quasars in hall et al ( 1995 , 1997 ) .",
    "we note , however , that those upper limits have been obtained from images _ not _ corrected for satellite wobble .",
    "they also assume therefore that the quasar light follows the standard hri psf derived by david et al ( 1995 ) and accounts for all the light in the innermost bin .",
    "our quasar host clusters are consistent with the luminosity of 3.7@xmath14detected by hall et al ( 1997 ) for the environment of the radio - intermediate quasar h1821 + 643 at a redshift @xmath15=0.297 .",
    "the inferred bolometric luminosities of the extended components we have found here are completely reasonable for moderately rich clusters of galaxies at low redshift .",
    "they are comparable to the luminosities of the clusters associated with the powerful radio galaxies cygnus a and 3c295 .",
    "they are however ( fig .",
    "1 ) more luminous than the extended x - ray emission detected around more distant 3cr radio galaxies above redshift one .",
    "whether this indicates evolution , a problem for radio galaxy / quasar unification , or is a result of small number statistics must await the compilation of a complete sample , which are study is not .",
    "all extended models have a central cooling time considerably shorter than a hubble time .",
    "we therefore explore the properties of the implied cooling flows occurring around these quasars by deriving some approximate parameters from the broken power - law fits to the profiles .",
    "we attribute all the x - ray luminosity of the extended component within radius @xmath9 to thermal bremsstrahlung from gas with electron density @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 ) at a temperature of 4 .",
    "the cooling time of the gas at @xmath9 ( except in the case of 3c275.1 ) is then between about 13 billion yr .",
    "we then estimate the cooling flow radius @xmath18 at which the cooling time is @xmath19  yr and obtain a rough indication of the mass deposition rate within that radius from the ratio of the mass of gas within @xmath18 to @xmath19  yr .",
    "the derived values are shown in table  [ tab : cf ] .",
    "note they are of course subject to not only the appropriateness of the fixed slopes chosen for our original broken power - law model , but also to the true gravitational potential of any cluster , and the amount of gravitational work done on the cooling gas .",
    "the values should be regarded as uncertain by a least a factor of 2 .",
    "they may be underestimated by a factor of at least 2 if the gas temperatures are significantly higher than the 4  kev assumed and there is internal absorption such as is common in low redshift cooling flows .",
    "note that the radius of the surface brightness break which we infer is in the range 4090  kpc , and is similar to the break radius in the profile of the cluster around iras  09104 ( @xmath20  kpc , crawford & fabian 1995b ) .",
    "this is likely to be the radius of the core of the gravitational potential of the cluster ; the @xmath21 profile then occurs within there since that gas is cooling at approximately constant pressure .",
    "such small gravitational core radii are characteristic of relaxed lensing cluster cores such as are associated with massive cooling flows ( allen 1998 ) .",
    "the large break radii found for 3c275.1 and h1821 + 643 do not agree with this picture and require more detailed images .",
    "we can also use our cooling flow parameters to derive a gas pressure @xmath11 at a radius of 30  ( see table [ tab : cf ] ) for comparison to the pressures derived from the completely independent method using the ionization state of the extended optical emission lines ( crawford & fabian 1989 ; bremer et al 1992 ; crawford & vanderreist 1997 ) .",
    "the pressures derived from the optical nebulosities mostly underestimate those derived from the x - ray profile fits ( figure  [ fig : pvsp ] ) by a factor of up to 10 .",
    "given that the gas pressures are mostly derived from the optical nebulosity using a conservative underestimate to the crucial but unknown uv and soft x - ray band of the ionizing nuclear spectrum , this discrepancy is not surprising .",
    "support for this interpretation of the disparity in derived pressures is found in crawford et al ( 1991 ) where a better knowledge of the ionizing continuum of the nucleus of 3c263 was found to increase the optically - derived pressure by up to an order of magnitude .",
    "in addition , we note that 3c254 , the quasar with the best agreement between the two pressure values is the only one where uv hst data has been used to constrain the shape of the ionizing continuum ( crawford & vanderriest 1997 ) .",
    "we note that the derived cluster luminosity for 3c273 is high and implies the presence of a rich cluster which is not seen at other wavelengths . at its relatively low redshift of @xmath22",
    ", such a cluster should be obvious in the optical band .",
    "as mentioned already , it has the profile most susceptible to systematic errors , and the absence of an optical cluster may argue for the existence of such errors .",
    "if the psf is then uncertain by a relative amount equal to the observed 3c273 profile and our empirical psf , then it will not change greatly our results on the other quasars except perhaps for 3c48 .",
    "inverse - compton scattering of quasar radiation could still contribute to our extended component of x - ray emission .",
    "if a significant process , the x - ray source would appear asymmetric and lop - sided , as ( back ) scattering by the electrons in the more distant radio lobe should be stronger than in the nearer lobe .",
    "the quality of our current data is insufficient to show any significant asymmetry , and so we are unable to assess the contribution from this process .",
    "observations of these sources with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm _ should clarify its relative importance to the total emission .",
    "the seven powerful radio - loud quasars studied here appear to be surrounded by luminous extended x - ray emission .",
    "the spatial properties of the emission are consistent with an origin in thermal emission from an intracluster medium .",
    "the radiative cooling time of the gas within @xmath23  kpc of the quasars is only a few billion years or less , indicating the presence of strong cooling flows of hundreds of @xmath24 .",
    "the high pressure of that gas is sufficient to support the extended optical nebulosities seen around many of these quasars and may play a rle in shaping the properties of the radio sources , such as structure , depolarization and possibly even fuelling and evolution ( fabian & crawford 1990 ) .",
    "such a rle is not clear from a comparison of radio properties with the neighbouring optical galaxy density ( rector et al 1995 ) .",
    "a small number of luminous clusters without central agn have so far been found beyond redshift 0.5 , and the discovery of a cluster at @xmath25 with luminosity @xmath26(donahue et al 1998 ) provides strong evidence for a low density universe .",
    "we have shown that the study of the environment of powerful radio - loud quasars is a promising way of extending the discovery of similarly luminous clusters both in numbers and to higher redshifts .",
