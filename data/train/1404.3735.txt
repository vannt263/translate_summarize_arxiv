    "the isotropy of the cosmic expansion is well - constrained for the early universe , particularly by cosmic microwave background observations , and is a basic tenet of physical cosmology .",
    "the change from a matter - dominated to a dark energy - dominated universe in recent times , however , raises the possibility of a dark energy - driven anisotropic expansion if dark energy is itself anisotropic .",
    "there is no obvious reason for such symmetry breaking , but observational tests of something as fundamental as the isotropy of the hubble expansion should be made for late times ( the current epoch ) .",
    "one such test is possible via extragalactic proper motions : if the expansion is anisotropic , then quasars and galaxies will stream toward directions of faster expansion and away from directions of slower expansion .",
    "the signature of anisotropic expansion in a homogeneous universe is thus a curl - free proper motion vector field ( to first order ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the term `` cosmic parallax '' has been used by some to indicate a general relative angular motion of objects in the universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and used by others in a more canonical sense to indicate apparent angular motion induced by the motion of the observer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we favor the latter usage ; this paper therefore treats the apparent proper motion induced by anisotropic cosmic expansion @xcite , referenced to the international celestial reference frame ( icrf ) in the current epoch .",
    "the observed proper motions are therefore relative , but are not necessarily induced by the observer s motion .    in this paper , we present a simple model of anisotropic expansion and fit the model to the @xcite proper motion catalog to place a new constraint on the isotropy of the hubble expansion and thus on the isotropy of dark energy .",
    "we assume @xmath3  km  s@xmath1  mpc@xmath1 and a flat cosmology ( this treatment is independent of specific assumptions about @xmath4 and @xmath5 , provided @xmath6 ) .",
    "as described in @xcite and @xcite , a homogeneous but anisotropic bianchi i model with metric @xmath7 has three different expansion rates , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , where the hubble parameter as observed is @xmath11 and the friedmann - robertson - walker metric is recovered for @xmath12 .",
    "this metric has a flat geometry and no global vorticity , but the anisotropic expansion will produce a shearing velocity field , causing objects to stream toward directions of faster expansion and away from directions of slower expansion .",
    "the shear can be characterized by the fractional deviation from the average hubble expansion today ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , or @xmath17 , isotropy corresponds to @xmath18 ( no deviation from @xmath19 in any direction ) , and the expansion is `` conserved '' : @xmath20 ( the directionless overall @xmath19 is preserved , despite anisotropy ) . under the simplifying assumption of straight geodesics ( incorrect , but a small error as demonstrated by @xcite ) , the sky signal of an anisotropic expansion is a curl - free quadrupolar proper motion vector field that is independent of distance .",
    "note that this is a `` real - time '' signal , meaning that the time derivatives are with respect to small coordinate time intervals today ( decades ) and therefore a constant @xmath19 is a good assumption .",
    "the application of this model by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite to the apparent proper motions of extragalactic objects , however , retained a metric fixed with respect to the equatorial coordinate system and did not allow the anisotropy to have an arbitrary orientation .",
    "application of this model to observations by @xcite was not rotationally invariant ( the result would depend on the choice of coordinate system ) . in order to obtain a fully general model ,",
    "we require rotational invariance appropriate for vector spherical harmonics ( the divergence and curl of the scalar spherical harmonics , @xmath21 ) : all orders @xmath22 for a given degree @xmath23 must be included in a model fit to data @xcite . here",
    "we demonstrate that all quadrupolar ( @xmath24 ) curl - free vector spherical harmonic orders naturally arise from an arbitrary rotation of the anisotropic coordinate system .",
    "using an arbitrary rotation from the equatorial reference frame to the one described by equation ( [ eqn : metric ] ) , we can allow for any anisotropy orientation .",
    "the anisotropy also need not be triaxial ; there could simply be a single direction of high or low expansion , provided the expansion conservation condition is satisfied .",
    "rotations are made about @xmath25 by angle @xmath26 , about the new @xmath27 by @xmath28 , and about the final @xmath29 axis by @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the anisotropic bianchi i axes can be expressed in the equatorial coordinate system via @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the rotation matrix about axis @xmath33 by angle @xmath34 .",
    "the equatorial coordinates of the anisotropy axes are therefore :    @xmath35    @xmath36    @xmath37    the anisotropic expansion proper motion vector field @xmath38 coefficients are listed in table [ tab : shear_theory ] ( see appendix [ appdx ] for the full equation ) .",
    "these were obtained by taking the time derivatives of the equatorial coordinates , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , expressed in terms of the shear terms @xmath41 .",
    "the general form of the vector field is @xmath42 \\bmath{\\hat{e}}_i \\label{eqn : sheareqn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where there are no imaginary coefficients for @xmath43 and the sum over real and imaginary coefficients is implied .",
    "the hubble constant can be written as @xmath44  @xmath45as  yr@xmath1 ( for @xmath46  km  s@xmath1  mpc@xmath1 ) , so a shear of 10% would produce streaming motions of order 1.5  @xmath45as  yr@xmath1",
    ".    comparison of this derivation of the shear field @xmath38 to the spheroidal ( curl - free or e - mode ) quadrupolar vector spherical harmonics @xcite reveals an exact one - to - one correspondence ( table [ tab : shear_theory ] ) .",
    "the treatment here is therefore rotationally invariant ( as desired ) , and it is therefore completely equivalent to fit the spheroidal @xmath24 vector spherical harmonics to a proper motion vector field to test the isotropy of expansion .",
    "it is not , however , correct to fit or select single or selected orders of a vector spherical harmonic model , as has been done previously .",
    "table [ tab : shear_theory ] lists the equivalent vector spherical harmonic coefficients ( see appendix [ appdx ] for the full equation ) , following the @xcite conventions : @xmath47 note that this equation has absorbed the factors of 2 for the @xmath48 orders and the factors of @xmath49 for the imaginary terms into the coefficients @xmath50 , in contrast to the definitions used by @xcite .

    "parenthetical values are @xmath0 uncertainties .",
    "the units are @xmath45as  yr@xmath1 .",
    "the z - score of a one - sided significance test is 1.1 , so the power in this mode is not significant .",

    "these results are insensitive to the initial parameter assumptions .",
    "while the anisotropy axes can be interchanged arbitrarily through rotations , the shear values and directions are stable best - fit solutions .",
    "the solution is likewise insensitive to the sometimes large intrinsic proper motions or large proper motion uncertainties of individual objects . restricting the sample to the 358 objects with proper motions and proper motion uncertainties less than 100  @xmath45as",

    "* equations ( 85 ) and ( 87 ) ) , is 1.1 , so the power in this mode is not significant .     and [ tab : e2quad_meas ] .",
    "the measured anisotropy is not significant , either by parameter in or total power .",
    "the high and low deviations from the average hubble expansion are indicated as converging ( @xmath62 ) and diverging ( @xmath63 ) loci , including error bars .",
    "the upper right scale bar indicates the amplitude of the vectors , the dotted line shows the galactic plane , the solid circle indicates the galactic center , the open circles mark the galactic poles , and the crosses indicate the @xmath64 direction.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "while the bianchi i metric model assumed for the data analysis is specific , the fitting function is a general @xmath24 spheroidal vector spherical harmonic ; the model plays a role in specific parameter estimation , but the vector field sky pattern is generic .",
    "one can therefore adapt the fit parameters to different cosmological models , and one can fit additional vector spherical harmonic terms ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ fig : shear ] shows a remarkable ( but non - significant ) alignment of the fit anisotropy axes with the galactic plane - equator intersection .",
    "this could be driven by a vertical spheroidal dipole component induced by vertical ( out - of - the - plane ) solar acceleration ( a second aberration drift ; * ? ? ?",
    ". a dipole fit to the proper motion vector field ( after subtracting the galactocentric acceleration described in section [ sec : methods ] ) is not significant and does not point toward the @xmath29 axis ( the points of convergence ) . since the anisotropy is neither significant in total power nor in individual parameters , this surprising alignment seems to be coincidental and should not be over - interpreted .",
    "the main limitation to this technique is the proper motion precision and sample size .",
    "the overall proper motion precision of individual objects will improve with time , as will the sample size of icrf `` defining sources , '' but these will be slow , secular improvements . the next order - of - magnitude improvement will be provided by the gaia mission .",
    "gaia is an optical astrometry mission that will measure 500,000 quasar proper motions with @xmath6580  @xmath45as astrometry for @xmath66 mag stars @xcite .",
    "unlike radio sources , compact optical extragalactic sources do not show significant internal intrinsic proper motions , so gaia proper motion catalogs will not exhibit the uncorrelated proper motion signals that contaminate radio measurements .",
    "we estimate that the gaia mission will constrain anisotropy below 1% .",
    "we have demonstrated how anisotropic hubble expansion can be measured or constrained using extragalactic proper motions , and we applied this technique to the best current proper motion catalog @xcite to place a new constraint on the isotropy of the hubble expansion and thus on the isotropy of dark energy .",
    "no significant anisotropy was detected ; the hubble expansion is isotropic to 7% ( @xmath0 ) , corresponding to streaming motions of 1  @xmath45as  yr@xmath1 , in the best - constrained directions ( @xmath219% and + 17% in the least - constrained directions ) and does not significantly deviate from isotropy in any direction .",
    "the gaia mission , which is expected to obtain proper motions for 500,000 quasars , will likely constrain the anisotropy below 1% .",
