    "two - dimensional dirac physics has aroused great interest in condensed matter physics ever since the discovery of graphene @xcite and topological insulators ( tis)@xcite due to its importance in both fundamental physics and device applications . in graphene ,",
    "gapless dirac cones exist at the momenta @xmath0 and @xmath1 point in the brillion zone ( bz ) with a large fermi velocity @xmath2 @xmath3 m / s , which is about 1/300 of the speed of light@xcite , and results in a high mobility for electron transport in graphene . due to its high mobility , graphene is believed to possess the potential in the applications involving fast speed electronic devices @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "when a gap ( mass ) is opened for dirac cones , the so - called `` parity anomaly '' , which was first known in high energy physics@xcite , can occur @xcite and lead to a large variety of topological states , including the quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) effect @xcite and the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) effect @xcite , in graphene .",
    "furthermore , it was predicted that these topological states in graphene can be spontaneously induced by interaction , leading to the so - called `` topological mott insulators''@xcite .",
    "however , due to the large fermi velocity , the density of states vanishes rapidly near the dirac cone , and the critical interaction strength is relatively large .",
    "thus , the reduction of fermi velocity in dirac fermions ( or equivalently a `` heavy '' dirac fermion ) is valuable for exploring new topological states in the dirac systems .    in this work ,",
    "we explore dirac physics in a hetero - junction with graphene on top of a ti .",
    "the qsh effect with a large energy gap has been predicted for graphene coupled to ti thin films@xcite .",
    "here we focus on the case of graphene coupled to a _ single _",
    "surface state of a three dimensional ti , which can be realized in experiments when the thickness of the ti is large enough so that the topological surface states on opposite surfaces are decoupled . in this case",
    ", we find that due to the strong hybridization between the four dirac cones from graphene ( two valleys and two spins ) and one dirac cone from the topological surface state , four of the resulting states will be gapped while one remains gapless with the fermi velocity significantly reduced . by constructing an effective model of this system based on first principles calculations ,",
    "we explore the underlying physical reason why the linear dispersion relation term is so small . as a consequence ,",
    "the `` heavy '' dirac fermion has a much larger density of states near the dirac point , and a relatively small interaction can drive the system into a gaped topological phase with non - zero hall conductance ( parity anomaly ) .",
    "below , we will first construct an effective model for this hetero - junction that reproduces the physics observed in our first - principles calculations , and then study the effects of interactions at the mean field level .",

    "one notices that the spin components of @xmath87 and @xmath88 are opposite , so the coupling between them has to involve a spin - flip process .",
    "since soc in graphene is negligible @xcite , this coupling can only originate from the hybridization with the ti surface states .",
    "therefore , the interactions between @xmath88 and @xmath87 in graphene can only be mediated by the interlayer coupling between graphene and the topological surface states through second order ( or higher order ) perturbations .",
    "a detailed analysis of the possible coupling processes is shown in the appendix d. we conclude that the weak coupling between @xmath87 and @xmath88 makes the resulting dirac fermion much heavier than that of the ti surface states .",
