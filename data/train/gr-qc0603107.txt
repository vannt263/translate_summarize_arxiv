    "regge calculus @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent and updated summary of regge calculus and its alternative approaches ) provides a discretized version of general relativity .",
    "it is , mainly , based on the idea of substituting a piecewise - linear ( pl)-manifold for differential manifold . in particular , these are simplicial manifolds built by gluing together two distinct @xmath2-dimensional flat simplexes by one and only one ( @xmath3)-dimensional face .",
    "the final product of this construction is called a simplicial complex , which owns the manifold structure if it has been made in such a way that each point of the simplicial complex has a neighbourhood homeomorphic to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the simplicial manifolds , we consider , are orientable . on a simplicial manifold",
    "we can define a metric structure .",
    "the metric is euclidean almost everywhere except near the ( @xmath5)-simplexes called hinges @xmath6 . near the hinges",
    "the metric is equivalent to a _",
    "cone_-metric , that is the metric * g * of @xmath7 the two dimensional cone @xcite @xcite .",
    "a two - dimensional cone is formed by cutting away a circular sector of angle @xmath8 and gluing together the two free edges .",
    "its apex is called cone point of angle @xmath8 and of curvature @xmath9 . on each ( @xmath5)-dimensional simplex @xmath6 , called an _ hinge _ ,",
    "a deficit angle @xmath10 , which is the cone curvature , is defined    @xmath11    where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is one of the @xmath14 @xmath2-dimensional simplices incident on @xmath6 , and @xmath15 its dihedral angles on @xmath6 .",
    "the dihedral angle of a @xmath2-simplex on the hinge is the angle between the ( @xmath3)-dimentional faces that have the hinge in common . @xmath10 and",
    "the volume of the hinge @xmath16 can be expressed @xcite as functions of the squared length of the one - dimensional simplices ( edges ) of the complex .",
    "the einstein - regge action is , in analogy to the continuum case , a functional over the simplicial manifolds and depends on the incidence matrix of the simplicial complex @xcite and on the ( squared ) lengths of the edges .",
    "usually , in regge calculus , the incidence matrix is fixed , so that the action can be written as    @xmath17    the corresponding einstein equations @xcite are derived by requiring that the action is stationary under the variation of the length of the edges .    the original aim of this theory was to give approximate solutions of the einstein equations in the case in which the topology is known .",
    "the theory is , as stressed by regge himself , completely coordinate independent .",
    "= 8.0truecm = 8.0truecm    now we summarize and update some definitions and results of @xcite that will be useful for our future discussions .",
    "consider an hinge @xmath6 and suppose that it is shared by @xmath18 @xmath2-simplices ( see fig.1 ) @xmath19",
    ".    given a @xmath2-dimensional simplicial complex , there exists a general procedure for defining the dual metric complex , called the voronoi dual @xcite @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-dimensional voronoi polyhedron dual to a vertex @xmath20 of the simplicial complex is the set of the points of the simplicial complex closer to @xmath20 than to any other vertex , using the standard flat metric in the simplex .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath21-simplex of the simplicial complex is dual to a @xmath22-polyhedron in the dual voronoi complex , and the @xmath21-dimensional linear space identified by the @xmath21 simplex is orthogonal to the @xmath22-dimensional space spanned by the corresponding polyhedron . in particular the point dual to the @xmath2-simplex @xmath23 is the centre of a @xmath24-dimensional sphere passing through all vertices of @xmath23 ( look at fig.1 ) .",
    "it was pointed out in reference @xcite that a theory of regge calculus locally invariant under the poincar group can be formulated by choosing in every simplex an orthonormal reference frame . in this way",
    "every @xmath2-dimensional simplex , considered as a piece of @xmath4 , can be seen as local inertial reference frame , being flat , and an n - bein base can be chosen in it . as in the continuum theory",
    ", we need a connection matrix between the reference frames of two simplexes that share a common ( @xmath3)-dimensional simplex .",
    "fixing @xcite @xcite @xcite the origin of the reference frames on the dual voronoi vertices , the orthogonal matrix @xmath25 , which allows passing from the reference frame of @xmath26 to the @xmath27 s , happens to be the levi - civita @xcite , torsion - free , connection matrix which is a function of the vertex coordinates of the common face @xmath28 both in the reference frame of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the hinge @xmath6 is in one - to - one correspondence with its dual two - dimensional voronoi plaquette that we still label by @xmath6 . now consider the following holonomy matrix and plaquette variable    @xmath29    as it has been shown @xcite @xcite , ( [ ruota ] ) is a rotation in the two - dimensional plane orthogonal to the ( @xmath5)-dimensional hyperplane spanned by the hinge @xmath6 .",
    "the rotation angle is the deficit angle ( [ apex ] ) .",
    "we consider @xmath5 linear independent edge - vectors of the hinge @xmath6 defined in the following way    @xmath30    and the antisymmetric tensor related to the oriented volume of @xmath6    @xmath31    at this point it seems natural to propose the following gravitational action @xcite    @xmath32    let @xmath16 be the oriented volume of the hinge @xmath6 .",
    "the action ( [ haction ] ) is equal @xcite to    @xmath33    which for small deficit angles @xmath10 reduces to the regge action ( [ reggeact ] ) .    the presence in the action of @xmath34 instead of @xmath10 is only a lattice artifact @xcite .",
    "the useful regime of this theory is @xmath35 .",
    "in fact frhlich @xcite has conjectured , as claimed also in @xcite , that this action converges to the einstein - hilbert action , and j.cheeger , w. muller , r.schrader in @xcite have proved that the einstein - regge action ( [ reggeact ] ) converges to the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "they proved that the convergence of the action is in _ sense of measure_. this applies when , roughly speaking , the number of the hinges of the simplicial manifold increases along with the incident number of the simplices at each hinge .",
    "then the triangulations will be finer and finer and the difference , in modulus , between the einstein - hilbert action on a manifold and the regge - einstein one , on the triangulations of the same manifold , become smaller and smaller .",
    "let s consider the ( @xmath3)-dimensional face @xmath36 between the simplices @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the vertex coordinates of @xmath37 are @xmath38 .",
    "the following vector @xcite    @xmath39    is normal to the face @xmath37 , and it is assumed to point outward from the interior of the simplex @xmath26 .",
    "the analogous vector @xmath40 in the reference frame of @xmath27 is related to the previous one by    @xmath41    it can be easily proved that ( [ orio ] ) can be written as a bivector    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the oriented volume of the simplex @xmath26 .",
    "we can consider the action as written on the dual voronoi - complex of the original simplicial complex .",
    "the dual of the hinge @xmath6 is a two dimensional plaquette whose vertices will be @xmath44 .",
    "these vertices are the dual of the @xmath2-simplices incident on the hinge @xmath6 .    if , briefly , we indicate @xmath45 as @xmath46 , and so on , the holonomy matrix ( [ ruota ] ) around the plaquette is    @xmath47    however this is still a second order formalism of discrete general relativity .",
    "the connection matrices @xmath46 and the @xmath48 are both functions of the coordinates of the edges of the simplicial complex .",
    "now we introduce a first order formalism in which @xmath46 and @xmath49 are independent variables",
    ". then equation ( [ relatto ] ) becomes a constraint    on the @xmath49 there is a further constraint since the @xmath50 normals to the ( @xmath3)-dimensional faces of a @xmath2-simplex @xmath26 are linearly dependent ,    @xmath51    there is a technical problem we would like pointing out .",
    "the gravitational action in the form ( [ haction ] ) could be dependent on the starting simplex .",
    "so we need to define the following antisymmetric tensor on the plaquette @xmath6",
    "@xmath52    the action then is    @xmath53    the action ( [ caction ] ) coincides with the action ( [ haction ] ) in the second - order formalism , and , since ( in matrix notation )    @xmath54    equation ( [ caction ] ) is independent of the starting simplex .",
    "moreover the action ( [ caction ] ) is invariant under the following set of transformations    @xmath55    where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are two elements of @xmath0 .",
    "this can be interpreted as the diffeomorphism invariance of this discrete theory of gravity .",
    "in this section we shall mainly focus on the four dimensional case .",
    "the action ( [ caction ] ) is invariant under the group @xmath1 which is the gauge group .",
    "it has been proved @xcite @xcite that the discrete equations of motion for this theory can be derived and appear very similar to general relativity equations in the covariant tetrad formalism @xcite , and in the limit for _ small deficit angles _ the _ levi - civita - regge _ connection ( the second order formalism which , in this case , is the regge calculus itself ) is , locally , the unique solution .",
    "this is , clearly , an analogy with the palatini continuum theory where , in the torsion - free case , the levi - civita connection is solution of one part of the first order field equations .",
    "we will use the following notation :    @xmath58    and let    @xmath59    be the haar measure on @xmath1 . the partition function for this theory",
    "is :    @xmath60    and this path - integral is invariant @xcite under local @xmath1 transformations ( [ gauge ] ) .    from group theory @xcite it",
    "is well known that a function @xmath61 on a compact group @xmath62 is called central if @xmath63 .",
    "thanks to the gauge invariance ( [ gauge ] ) previously mentioned @xmath64 is a central function on @xmath1 .",
    "it follows @xcite we can expand it in terms of the characters @xmath65 of the irreducible representations @xmath66 of the group @xmath1 .",
    "we can omit the index @xmath67 in the holonomy matrix @xmath68 since it does not depend from the starting simplex @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath69    where the coefficients @xmath70 are defined by @xcite    @xmath71    @xmath72 being the @xmath1 haar measure on the holonomy matrices @xmath73 and @xmath74 the complex conjugate of @xmath65 .",
    "these new considerations imply we can write the previous quantum measure as    @xmath75    and this last equation seems suggesting that we can label the interior of each plaquette by an irreducible representation @xmath66 of @xmath1 .",
    "this is very similar to the spin foam formalism where the interior of each oriented @xmath76-polyhedron is labeled , or colored , by an irreducible representation of @xmath1 @xcite@xcite.although this is an early first stage result some sensible differences appear respect to spin foam formalism .",
    "the main one , we would like to highlight , is that barret and crane @xcite proved that the geometry of each four - simplex can be completely characterized by ten bivector two - forms    @xmath77    where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are two independent edge vectors which belong to one of ten triangles of a four - dimensional simplex . in order to label each oriented @xmath76-polyhedron by an irreducible representation of @xmath1 they quantize the bivector two - form .",
    "then they associate , in four dimensions , an irreducible representation @xmath66 to the interior of each triangle .",
    "some technical problems arise in implementing this quantization@xcite . mainly in the simplicial @xmath80 theory for spin foam formalism , which is the proposal of barret - crane model@xcite ,",
    "it is needed to consider a generic two form @xmath81 and impose , at quantum level , that equation ( [ bivoco ] ) be a quantum constraint .",
    "although we have also a bivector two - form @xmath82 ( [ media ] ) in the action ( [ caction ] ) , which has a close resemblance with @xmath80 and plebanski s action for general relativity , it is very clearly defined on the @xmath76- voronoi - plaquette instead of the triangle dual to the plaquette .",
    "moreover we do not need to quantize this bivector two - form because , as we have seen , the expansion ( [ svilup ] ) in the path - integral tells us how to label the plaquette by an irreducible representation of @xmath1 .    anyway ,",
    "till now , we have not found that the partition function ( [ color ] ) can be written as claimed in spin foam formalism @xcite :    @xmath83    where @xmath84 is an oriented @xmath76-complex , @xmath85 is a weight associated to each @xmath76-complex @xmath84 , @xmath86 is an @xmath1-irreducible representation associated to each @xmath76-face @xmath61 , @xmath87 an intertwiner which , at each edge @xmath88 , maps the @xmath1-irreducible representations associated with the incoming @xmath76-faces at the edge @xmath88 to the outcoming @xmath1-irreducible representations .",
    "@xmath89 is a coefficient associated wih each face @xmath61 and so @xmath90 and @xmath91 with each edge @xmath88 and vertex @xmath92 respectively .",
    "one of the reason of it , we have found , is that the constraints ( [ relatto ] ) and ( [ chiusura ] ) , the delta function of the partition function ( [ color ] ) , make the integrals highly non - local objects with some similarities with the measure of quantum regge calculus @xcite .",
    "it happens that the @xmath93 s , which are not adjacent and `` very far '' , can be correlated by implementing the constraints.this seems to prevent writing the partition functions ( [ color ] ) as a product of three factor as in ( [ foam ] ) . in bc - model , as well as other models for spin foam formalism @xcite , the four - dimesional simplices , or equivalently , in the dual map , the dual vertices , are , in general , separeted one form the others and there are no constraints to be implemented so the partition function results to be factorized as in ( [ foam ] )",
    "the coupling with fermionic matter , in the continuum case on riemannian manifolds with torsion - free connection , is given by the lagrangian density    @xmath94    the @xmath95 are the dirac - matrices satisfying the clifford algebra    @xmath96    whereas @xmath97 is the n - dimensional dirac spinor field ( @xmath98),@xmath99 the covariant derivative , and @xmath100 the n - beins on the tangent space of the riemannian manifold @xmath101 .",
    "now we have all the ingredients to define the coupling of gravity with fermionic matter on the lattice in analogy with the continuum case@xcite .",
    "let @xmath102 or @xmath103 ( depending on whether @xmath2 is even or odd ) and consider the @xmath104-dimensional representation of the two - fold covering group of @xmath0@xcite .",
    "so , instead of considering the connection matrices @xmath46 , we will deal with the @xmath105 connection matrices @xmath106 such that    @xmath107    given @xmath106 we can determine @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore if we know @xmath46 , we can determine @xmath106 up to a sign .",
    "in particular , from ( [ 2-fold ] ) , we can write @xmath46 as @xcite    @xmath108    in the discrete theory we assume that the spinor field is a @xmath104 complex vector defined at each vertex of the dual voronoi complex , that is to say a map that to each vertex @xmath26 associates the @xmath104 complex vector @xmath109 .",
    "let @xmath110 the distance between the two neighboring circumcenters in @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "we are ready to define the covariant derivative @xmath111 on a lattice    @xmath112    so far the discrete version of the the action for the coupling between gravity and fermionic matter can be written in the form ( see also @xcite )    @xmath113    then the quantum measure , which also includes fermionic matter , can be written as    @xmath114    where @xmath23 is the action for pure gravity ( [ caction ] ) , @xmath115 the haar measure on the two - fold covering group of @xmath0 , while @xmath116 and @xmath117 are grassmann variables .",
    "now on let s focus our reasonings in four dimensions . the two - fold covering group of @xmath1 is @xmath118 .",
    "if we denote with    @xmath119    and with    @xmath120    we can expand @xmath121 in fourier series on the compact group @xmath122 @xcite    @xmath123    where    @xmath124    with @xmath125 denoting the irreducible representations of @xmath122 and @xmath126 the dimension of the irreducible representation .",
    "then we can rewrite equation ( [ minestra ] ) in the following way :    @xmath127    in which @xmath128 , according to equation ( [ svilup ] ) , is the character of the @xmath66th - irreducible representation of the two - fold covering @xmath129 of the holonomy matrix @xmath68 around the plaquette @xmath6 .",
    "although this partition function seems pretty complicated , it allows a straightforward _ combinatorial _ interpretation .",
    "if , as it seems very plausible even if not proved yet , local regge calculus is related to spin foam formalism then the presence of two independent representation indices @xmath125 and @xmath66 , in the path integral ( [ fermfin ] ) , can be interpretated , from a diagrammatical and combinatorial point of view as well , as we can associated each irreducible representation @xmath66 with the * interior * of each plaquette @xmath6 and each irreducible representation @xmath125 with each dual - edge @xmath130 .",
    "this corresponds , graphically , to color the interior of each plaquette and each edge with , in general , * different * colors !",
    "this would imply that the corrispondings spin networks , as projection along the evolution direction @xcite of spin foam @xmath76-complex , of gravity with fermionic matter would be characterized by the fact that a @xmath122 rapresentation @xmath66 is associated to each edge and , pairwise , an independent , from @xmath66 , @xmath122 representation @xmath125 is associated to each vertex as well .",
    "we have introduced a discrete theory of gravity in its first - order formalism .",
    "we have defined an action as the sum over the hinges of the traces of the holonomy matrices multiplied by the oriented volumes of the hinges .",
    "this action can be written on the dual voronoi complex of the original simplicial complex .",
    "we can express the action as a function of the connection matrices and of the vectors @xmath48 which are normal to the faces of the simplices and whose modulo is proportional to the volume of the faces themself .",
    "the action is very similar to the wilson action of lattice gauge theory@xcite . here",
    "the @xmath48 have the same role as the @xmath2-bein in the continuum theory .",
    "moreover the action is locally invariant under the action of lorentz group .    a quantum measure and the relative partition function has been defined .",
    "they are locally invariant under the action of @xmath0 .",
    "the expansion of the exponential factor , in the partition function , shows that there are same similarities between local regge calculus and spin foam formalism .",
    "however many severe difference seems to show up as well , mainly based on the fact that , due to the presence of constraints on the dynamical variable which have to be implemented at quantum level , the quantum measure of local regge calculus , as in the case of regge calculus @xcite , is _ highly _ non local .",
    "this generates differences between the partition function of local regge calculus and spin foam formalism .",
    "we guess that , since the action of local regge calculus converges in _ the continuum limit _ to the einstein - hilbert theory , whereas none have proved yet that spin foam formalism converges to gravity and spin foam formalism is mainly based on many different models , a possible future work would consist of showing how we can derive different models used in spin foam formalism from local regge calculus doing suitable approximations .",
    "this should demonstate that local regge calculus contains spin foam formalism .",
    "we have introduced a coupling of fermionic matter with discrete gravity .",
    "this coupling seems very natural and might be , in case , a way to introduce fermionic matter and gauge fields as well in spin foam formalism . as in the _ pure_-gravity case ,",
    "the expansion of the exponential factor shows strict analogies with spin foam formalism but , we have seen , the introduction of fermionic matter implies some peculiar lebeling of the @xmath76-complex which could affect , pairwise , the spin foam complex and the relative spin network as well .",
