    "prior to the advent of  and , the origin of the soft x - ray emission from heavily obscured agn remained very uncertain .",
    "recently , however , observations with  and  have revolutionized our understanding of heavily obscured agn ( for a complete description of ,  and their relative capabilities see jansen 2001 , weisskopf 2002 and references therein ) . the combination of the high spatial resolution afforded by , the large collecting area of  and the high spectral resolution x - ray spectroscopy capabilities ( in the form of x - ray grating and ccd instruments ) of both missions across the 0.1 - 12 kev band is beginning reveal many new details of the x - ray emission from heavily obscured agn , particularly with regard to the soft x - ray emission from these objects .",
    "observations of several heavily obscured agn have revealed considerable extended soft x - ray emission in each source , that is tightly correlated with the o[iii](@xmath75007 ) emission observed with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ; ngc 1068 - young 2001 ; mrk 3 - sako 2000 ; ngc 4151 - ogle 2000 ; circinus - sambruna 2001 ) . in several of these sources ( _ e.g. _ ngc 1068 - young 2001 ) , the extended x - ray emission and the o[iii](@xmath75007 ) emission clearly traces the spiral arms and other large - scale structures out to a considerable distance from the active nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "similarly recent spectral observations of these agn with the x - ray grating instruments on  ( ngc 1068 - brinkman 2002 , ogle 2002 ; mrk 3 - sako 2000 ; ngc 4151 - ogle 2000 ; circinus - sambruna 2001 ) and  ( kinkhabwala 2002 ) have revealed soft x - ray spectra dominated by prominent emission lines from a range of light elements ( _ e.g. _ c , n , o , ne etc ) . these observations constitute a growing body of evidence that suggests that the soft x - ray emission from heavily obscured seyferts is largely composed of soft x - ray emission lines that originate in gas that is photoionized ( and photoexcited ) by the central agn .",
    "the seyfert 1.5 galaxy ngc 4151 was identified as an x - ray source over thirty years ago ( gursky 1971 ) .",
    "one of the brightest agn accessible in the x - ray band , ngc 4151 has been extensively studied by missions such as , , , ,  and more recently , ,  and . this observational focus has revealed that the spectrum of ngc 4151 from 0.1 - 100 kev is comprised of a complex mixture of emission and absorption components , probably originating in a variety of locations from the innermost parts of the putative accretion disk in ngc 4151 , out to the extended narrow - line region of the galaxy . despite the relatively poor quality of the spectra ,",
    "previous observations ( particularly observations with ) did tentatively reveal several unresolved soft x - ray features , suggesting that the soft x - ray emission was somewhat more complex than had been previously suggested .",
    "the most prominent feature found with  was at an energy of @xmath00.88 kev and was tentatively associated with o viii ly@xmath8 rrc ( weaver 1994 ; griffiths 1998 ) .",
    "the detailed nature of the soft x - ray emission in ngc 4151 has only recently been revealed through a  hetg observation ( ogle 2000 , yang 2001 ) .",
    "this observation demonstrated that the soft x - ray spectrum was composed almost entirely of emission lines and rrc , with little or no detected continuum emission of any form ( and hence no absorption features ) .",
    "utilizing the excellent spatial resolution of , ogle ( 2000 ) resolved @xmath070% of the soft x - ray emission as extended emission , originating up to 11.5  from the agn , that demonstrated an excellent correspondence with the bi - conical o[iii](@xmath75007 ) emission previously imaged with the hst ( evans 1993 ) .",
    "the  observation was even capable of resolving the spatial profiles of several of the brightest emission lines ( including the iron k@xmath8 emission line ) showing that the individual line emission was genuinely extended along the direction of the optical ionization cones .",
    "the  observation dramatically confirmed that the hard x - ray spectrum of ngc 4151 is strongly cut - off below  2 kev and that the soft excess is not predominantly produced by electron scattering of the hard x - ray continuum .",
    "the  analysis finds evidence for both photoionized and collisionally ionized ( thermal ) gas in the enlr , however many of the details of the ionized medium remained elusive , due to the large number ( 33 in total ) and low significance of the features detected .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ 2 ] details the  observations of ngc 4151 .",
    "section  [ 3 ] presents the  rgs spectra and discusses the spectral modelling in terms of emission from an ionization cone .",
    "section  [ 4 ] compares the rgs spectra of ngc 4151 with the soft x - ray spectra of ngc 1068 and mrk 3 .",
    "section  [ 5 ] presents a preliminary look at the correspondence between the  rgs and the  epic soft x - ray spectra of ngc 4151 .",
    "ngc 4151 was observed with  five times during december 21@xmath9 - 23@xmath10 , 2000 .",
    "the rgs instruments were active for all five observations and the data were processed with the standard rgs pipeline processing chains incorporated in the  sas v5.4.1 . dispersed source spectra and background spectra were extracted with the automated rgs extraction tasks in the sas .",
    "the sas filters the rgs events in dispersion - channel vs ccd - pulse - height space to separate the data from the different spectral orders .",
    "investigation of the individual spectra indicate that the 2@xmath11 order rgs spectra contain a negligible amount of information ( a count rate of @xmath1210% of that in the 1@xmath9 order spectra , despite having @xmath060% of the effective area below 10 ) and as a result only the 1@xmath9 order spectra are presented here .",
    "the resulting spectra have a total effective exposure time of @xmath0128 ks and @xmath0125 ks for the rgs 1 and 2 instruments respectivly . a previous investigation of the  epic spectra confirms that the soft x - ray spectrum of ngc 4151 remained relatively constant for the duration of the observation ( schurch 2003 ) .",
    "the spectra from the five observations were co - added to produce a single high signal - to - noise source spectrum and a single background spectrum for each rgs instrument .",
    "the full spectra and individual lines were analyzed with both maximum likelihood and @xmath13 minimization techniques .",
    "for the maximum likelihood analysis the spectra were left unbinned however , for the @xmath13 minimization techniques ( which , in general , are not particularly well - suited to fitting the sharp features observed in this and similar high resolution soft x - ray spectra ) the spectra were binned to a minimum of 20 counts per spectral channel .",
    "investigation of the spatial extent of the x - ray emission observed by  reveals that the soft x - ray emission is not significantly extended on scales greater than the mirror psf , consistent with the details of the previously reported  observation of ngc 4151 ( ogle 2000 ) .",
    "figure  [ rgs1 ] shows the  rgs spectra from the combined observations of ngc 4151 .",
    "the spectrum is completely dominated by line emission and radiative recombination continua ( rrc ) .",
    "line emission is clearly detected from hydrogen - like and helium - like ionization states of neon , oxygen , nitrogen and carbon and in many cases the line emission associated with these ions is not limited to the ly@xmath8 ( 2p-1s ) transition but includes higher order resonance transitions ( np-1s ) labeled @xmath14-@xmath15 for the different hydrogen - like and helium - like species respectively .",
    "much of the unidentified line emission below @xmath016  can be associated with a multitude of unresolved iron l - shell emission lines , along with some contribution from hydrogen - like and helium - like silicon and magnesium .",
    "the spectra show no significant continuum emission and no fluorescent line emission ( there may be a marginal detection of silicon k@xmath8 fluorescence at @xmath07.1 , however without a good knowledge of the iron l - shell emission in this region it is not possible to measure the line cleanly ) .",
    "the spectrum is remarkably similar to the soft x - ray spectrum of the archetypal bright seyfert 2 galaxy , ngc 1068 , reported by kinkhabwala ( 2002 ) .",
    "both sources show strong emission line triplets from helium - like nitrogen and oxygen , with a similar pattern of resonance , intercombination and forbidden line strengths . following the analysis of the  rgs observation of ngc 1068 presented in kinkhabwala ( 2002 ) , line fluxes , centroid energies and line widths",
    "were determined for the bright , unambiguously identified , emission lines observed in the spectra .",
    "the spectral fits quoted here for individual strong line features were performed with @xmath13 minimization techniques ( and correspondingly the data were binned to a minimum of 20 counts per spectral channel ) .",
    "an examination of the fit properties using maximum likelihood fitting techniques for individual lines reveals that the best - fit parameters are not significantly different using these statistical techniques in comparison with the @xmath13 fits , as expected given the bright nature of the features examined here .",
    "the intrinsic profiles of the emission lines are represented by a line model with a gaussian profile ( we caution , however , that the original line profile may in fact not be gaussian , although it does appear to be a good approximation for the lines presented here ) which allows the determination of accurate line centroid energies , fluxes and , in some cases , line widths . the results of fitting this profile to the brightest emission lines are given in table  [ rgsgglfit ] .",

    "most of the measured line centroid energies are consistent with a mild blueshift , of between @xmath0100 - 1000 km s@xmath1 , with respect to the systemic velocity of the lines .",
    "this implies a line - of - sight outflow velocity for the ionized material of @xmath671000 km s@xmath1 , consistent with the line shifts of the absorption lines observed in the uv spectrum of ngc 4151 ( @xmath0600 km s@xmath1 ; kriss 1995 ) .",
    "many of the observed line widths are largely unconstrained , with the spectral fitting only yielding upper limits ( these are not quoted in table  [ rgsgglfit ] ) ; however the seven line widths that are constrained by the spectral fitting appear to show a bimodal distribution with the shorter wavelength lines having an average line width of @xmath68@xmath00.025 (@xmath01000 km s@xmath1 fwhm ) and the longer wavelength lines having an average line width of @xmath00.005 (@xmath0200 km s@xmath1 fwhm ) .",
    "the observed line widths imply that the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the outflowing material is @xmath671000 km s@xmath1 which is somewhat lower than the line widths of the absorption lines observed in the uv ( 1000 - 2500 km s@xmath1 ; kriss 1995 ) .",
    "the bimodal distribution of the line widths as a function of the wavelength of the line is suggestive of a scenario in which individual clouds of emitting material close to the source of the ionizing continuum are moving more rapidly than clouds further from the continuum source .",
    "the large majority of the soft x - ray flux of ngc 4151 as measured by  is not extended on scales larger than @xmath02 , demonstrating that the reported extended soft x - ray flux will not contribute considerably to the line widths measured in the rgs spectrum .",
    "the radiative recombination continua ( rrc ) identified in the rgs spectra are the result of a free electron recombining directly into a bound state of an ion .",
    "recombination to the ground state represents the dominant transition and is the only transition considered during the spectral modelling .",
    "the free electrons can have any energy above the recombination threshold and hence the feature produced is neither symmetrical or narrow .",
    "the energy of the electrons prior to the recombination process is dependent upon the electron temperature of the emitting plasma and hence the width of the rrc features provides a direct measurement of the recombining electron temperature , @xmath69 ( liedahl & paerels , 1996 ; liedahl 1999 ) .",
    "rrc originating in hot plasmas are broad and often subtle features however , rrc from cool plasmas are narrow , prominent , features .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the emitting material will affect the rrc in exactly the same manner as it affects the emission lines discussed previously , however this effect is negligible here due to the low velocities of the ions involved compared to that of the electrons .",

    "however , since only 7 lines have constrained line widths in the ngc 4151 spectrum , compared to 23 lines with constrained widths in the ngc 1068 spectrum , caution should be strongly emphasized in interpreting the validity of the distribution of line widths in ngc 4151 .",
    "interestingly the average line width found in the ngc 1068 data ( @xmath01100 km s@xmath1 fwhm ) is comparable to the average line width of the group of broader lines in the ngc 4151 spectrum ( @xmath01000 km s@xmath1 fwhm ) .",
    "it is tempting , based upon a comparison of the helium - like triplet plasma diagnostic ratios ( r and g ; section  [ 3 - 3 ] ) to infer that the ionization cones in ngc 4151 have a somewhat lower electron temperature and a somewhat higher electron density than those in ngc 1068 ( kinkhabwala 2002 ) .",
    "unfortunatly the situation may not be a clear as cut as this simple comparison suggests , primarily due to the unknown effect of photoexcitation on the diagnostic ratios ( discussed previously in seciton  [ 3 - 3 ] ) .",
    "the best - fit ionic column densities for ngc 1068 were found to be similar to those observed _ in absorption _ for seyfert 1 galaxies , implying either radially stratified ionization zones or , more likely , a broad distribution of densities at any given radius .",
    "an inspection of the radial column densities fit to the rgs spectrum reveals that ngc 4151 appears to have less ionized material in its ionization cones , by a factor of @xmath03.5 on average .",
    "the best - fit ionic electron temperatures , based on the widths of the rrc features , are also extremely similar between ngc 4151 and ngc 1068 ( although the comparatively large errors on these temperatures prevents any definite conclusions being drawn regarding this similarity ) .",
    "the ionic column densities are dependent on a combination of factors including , cone length , density , ionization parameter and the filling factor of the material .",
    "lower ionic column densities could be the result of lower ionizing flux or less material in the ionization cones , however a somewhat more plausible explanation , in line with the smaller r - values from the helium - like line triplets , could be that the material in the ionization cones of ngc 4151 is rather more dense than the material in the ionization cones of ngc 1068 .",
    "since the recombination rate is dependent on the density of the material , this can result in a smaller ionized fraction for a similar ionizing continuum .",
    "the  hetg observation of mrk 3 was the first published high resolution soft x - ray spectrum of a seyfert 2 galaxy and showed unambiguously that the soft x - ray emission in mrk 3 is composed almost entirely of emission lines and rrc , with little or no continuum emission .",
    "the soft x - ray spectrum of mrk 3 is , again , remarkably analogous to the soft x - ray spectrum of ngc 4151 , though with somewhat less statistical significance due to the rapidly decreasing effective area of the hetg instrument at wavelengths above @xmath09 . in both sources there",
    "is strong evidence to suggest that the observed emission lines are produced in a photoionized and photoexcited plasma ( sako 2000 ) .",
    "the importance of photoexcitation in the spectrum of mrk 3 is highlighted by the observed weak iron l - shell emission , rather than by the enhanced higher order resonance transitions , rejecting explanations from a recombination dominated or a collisionally dominated plasma . despite this impressive spectrum ,",
    "the  observation of mrk 3 only partially resolves two of the helium - like line triplets detected in the rgs spectrum of ngc 4151 ( oxygen and neon ) , due to the limited number of photons in each feature , and as a result many of the properties of the plasma are not well constrained .",
    "in particular , the resonance and intercombination lines of these triplets can not be separated and as a result sako ( 2000 ) quote a different diagnostic line ratio ( _ i.e. _ ( r+i)/f ) to the line ratios used here .    at wavelengths shorter than @xmath09",
    "the  spectrum shows evidence for a reflection dominated continuum along with clear detections of emission lines that are either extremely difficult or impossible to detect with the rgs ( given its limited spectral bandpass ) , namely fe xxvi , fe xxv , fe k@xmath8 , s xvi , s xv , s k@xmath8 , si xiv , si xiii , si k@xmath8 , mg xii and mg xi ( sako 2000 ) .",
    "this plethora of lines highlights the complimentary capabilities of  and  and strongly supports future observations of bright , heavily obscured agn with both  ( using the hetg ) and , to obtain the highest possible resolution x - ray spectra over the widest possible energy range .",
    "the line ratios calculated from the  detections of the helium - like silicon and magnesium line triplets ( _ i.e. _ si xiii and mg xi ) are all inconsistent with the expected values for a collisionally ionized plasma and are marginally consistent with the predictions from a photoionized plasma , similar to the conclusions from the triplet ratios for both ngc 4151 and ngc 1068 .",
    "one of the strengths of  is that all the science instruments operate simultaneously during each observation , allowing a direct comparison between the high resolution spectra from the rgs instruments and the lower resolution spectra from the epic ccd detectors .",
    "this comparison is particularly useful in exposing features in each source spectrum that the other detectors struggle to detect .",
    "for example , broad features present in the 0.3 - 2.5 kev range are not easily identified in rgs spectra , but will be more clearly observed by the epic instruments .",
    "conversely , features that appear to be broad in the epic spectrum may be resolved into a set of individual narrow lines by the rgs instruments .",
    "conclusions from the process of comparing the epic and rgs spectra are complicated by the need for good calibration _ and cross - calibration _ for each instrument involved .    .",
    "_ lower panel _ : the ratio of the data to the model prediction.,height=8 ]    figure  [ epicrgscomp ] shows the full window mode epic pn spectra fit with a model that combines the best - fit of the hard x - ray model developed in schurch ( 2003 ) and the best - fit of the ` ionization cone ' soft x - ray model presented in section  [ 3 - 4 ] .",
    "in addition to the hard x - ray model and the ionization cone model , a silicon k@xmath8 line was included in the fitting .",
    "the energy of the line was fixed at 1.73 kev and the line width was fixed to be the same width as the iron k@xmath8 line width .",
    "the line flux was fixed to be 5% of the flux contained in the iron k@xmath8 line , in keeping with the ratio of the iron k@xmath8 to silicon k@xmath8 line fluxes measured in the high resolution  spectrum of mrk 3 .",
    "initially the column densities of the hydrogen and helium - like atomic species were fixed to be the values measured by the rgs data .",
    "key parameters in the hard x - ray model ( _ e.g. _ ionization parameter , iron k@xmath8 line flux etc ; see schurch 2003 for details ) were free parameters in the fit , but no contributions from iron l - shell transitions were included in the fit .",
    "this highly restricted model does not provide a good fit to the epic spectrum , with considerable residuals remaining below 2 kev .",
    "relaxing the constraints of the model by incorporating a contribution from iron l - shell emission , improves the fit considerably and results in similar values for the column densities of iron ionization states from iron xvi - xxiii to those found with the rgs . despite the improvement",
    ", the overall fit remains poor with considerable residuals still remaining across the soft x - ray region .",
    "relaxing the constraints of the model more considerably by allowing the column densities of the hydrogen and helium - like atomic species to be free parameters in the model fit , provides a reasonable fit to the broadband x - ray spectrum of ngc 4151 ( @xmath107=2709 for 2194 d.o.f ) however residuals remain in the fit below 2 kev at a level of @xmath010% ( figure  [ epicrgscomp ] ) .",
    "the best - fit column densities for the hydrogen and helium - like atomic species are typically within a factor of @xmath03 of the best - fit column densities determined from the rgs modelling .",
    "we do note quote these values here because the relatively poor spectral resolution of the epic instruments result in considerable degeneracy between the column densities measured for specific atomic species making any specific values at best unreliable and at worst misleading . despite this caveat",
    ", we note that the best - fit column densities of nitrogen vii , neon x and silicon xiv measured in the epic data are considerably lower in comparison with those measured in the rgs data ( factors of 3.5 , 40 , and 16 respectively ) .",
    "the modelling is not significantly improved by the addition of either a soft x - ray power - law ( representing a scattered fraction of the underlying continuum ) or blackbody emission ( to represent the canonical soft x - ray excess often observed in seyfert 1 galaxies ) .",
    "considerably more detailed modelling of the rgs spectrum utilizing the additional data from the most recent  observations of ngc 4151 , coupled with improvements in the relative instrument calibrations , is required before any firm conclusions on the nature of the remaining fit residuals can be determined .",
    "we present a detailed analysis of the rgs spectrum of ngc 4151 from a total of @xmath0125 ks of  observations . the epic spectra from these observations",
    "are presented in schurch ( 2003 ) .",
    "the analysis uses the high spectral resolution of the rgs instruments to characterize the nature and origin of the soft x - ray spectrum of ngc 4151 .    * the soft x - ray spectrum of ngc 4151 ( figure  [ rgs1 ] )",
    "is completely dominated by line emission and radiative recombination continua .",
    "line emission , including higher order ( @xmath14-@xmath15 ) resonance transitions , is clearly detected from hydrogen - like and helium - like ionization states of neon , oxygen , nitrogen and carbon .",
    "much of the unidentified line emission below @xmath016  can be associated with a combination of iron l - shell emission and lines from hydrogen - like and helium - like silicon and magnesium . *",
    "the rgs spectra show no significant continuum emission and no fluorescent line emission associated with neutral material . *",
    "the measured line centroid energies are consistent with a blueshift of between @xmath0100 - 1000 km s@xmath1 , with respect to the systemic velocity of ngc 4151 .",
    "the seven observed line widths that are constrained by the data tentatively suggest a bimodal distribution , with average line widths of @xmath01000 km s@xmath1 and @xmath0200 km s@xmath1 ( fwhm ) .",
    "the measured line blueshifts are generally consistent with the outflow velocities of the absorption lines observed in the uv spectrum of ngc 4151 ( kriss 1995 ) , implying that the uv and x - ray line features originate in the same material .",
    "* plasma diagnostics , based on the ratios of the resonance , intercombination and forbidden lines of the observed helium - like triplets , imply electron temperatures of @xmath01 - 5@xmath2 k and electron densities of @xmath010@xmath3 @xmath5 in nitrogen and oxygen and @xmath010@xmath4 @xmath5 from neon ( porquet & dubau 2000 ) we note again that the effects of photoexcitation may have a considerable effect on the values of electron temperature and density determined by these diagnostic ratios ( see section  [ 3 - 3 ] ) .",
    "the wide range of the calculated electron densities is suggestive of either a ` clumpy ' extended nlr or a region in which the material has grossly non - solar elemental abundances . *",
    "the soft x - ray spectrum of ngc 4151 is remarkably similar to the soft x - ray spectrum of ngc 1068 ( kinkhabwala 2002 ) .",
    "the correspondence between the two source spectra is evident on the general scale from the strong emission lines and rrc associated with the same ionic species , which dominate the spectra of both sources .",
    "the resemblance of the ngc 4151 and ngc 1068 soft x - ray spectra is also apparent in the details of the spectra ( _ i.e. _ the similar helium - like triplet ratios and rrc temperatures ) . *",
    "the ` ionization cone ' model , developed by kinkhabwala ( 2002 ) to model the rgs spectra of ngc 1068 , reproduces all of the hydrogen - like and helium - like emission features observed in the soft x - ray spectrum of ngc 4151 _ in detail_. the best - fit radial and transverse velocities of the material in the ionization cones agree well with the blueshift and velocity dispersion measured from the individual line centroid energies , and are similar to the radial and transverse velocities measured from the soft x - ray spectrum of ngc 1068 .",
    "the individual ionic column densities are somewhat smaller than those measured for ngc 1068 , which , in combination with the plasma diagnostic ratios from the helium - like triplets , suggests that the material in the ionization cones of ngc 4151 may be somewhat denser than the material in the ionization cones of ngc 1068 .",
