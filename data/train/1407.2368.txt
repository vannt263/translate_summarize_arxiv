    "sa 0426 - 002 is a unique dwarf galaxy , and the authors are unable to locate a de with comparable morphology to sa 0426 - 002 in the literature .",
    "while bar - like des are known to exist in the virgo cluster @xcite , these dwarfs do not exhibit the low - surface brightness lobes seen for sa  0426 - 002 in sdss imaging of comparable depth .",
    "one possible explanation for this unusual morphology is that sa  0426 - 002 is being morphologically transformed from a low mass disc or dwarf irregular to a dwarf elliptical via harassment . due to multiple high - speed interactions with other cluster members ,",
    "the infalling disc has been tidally perturbed , triggering bar formation . during this process ,",
    "stars in the outer region of the disc are tidally stripped , forming arms / tidal features ( e.g. mastropietro et al . , 2005 ) ,",
    "resulting in a high effective radius @xmath71 .",
    "for the galaxy s luminosity eventually , only the central bar will remain .",
    "we therefore hypothesise that sa 0426 - 002 has not yet had its disc completely stripped by high - speed interactions , and the low surface brightness wings are stars being tidally stripped from the galaxy .",
    "simulations of bar formation in tidally transforming discs have focused heavily on the milky way satellite system ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "while ngc  1275 is more massive than the milky way , the tidal transformation of low mass discs by its gravitational potential will progress in a similar , though more rapid , fashion , with bars forming on timescales @xmath72  gyr .",
    "the simulations of mayer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) show that a rotationally supported , discy dirr infalling into a mw - sized halo will form a bar with ring - like structures comparable to the morphology of sa  0426 - 002 .",

    "the morphology of the dwarf is also remarkably similar to the simulations of mastropietro et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , , and @xcite , particularly for face - on views of simulated tidally interacting dwarfs .",

    "present simulations of low mass disc galaxies with varying bulge / disc ratios undergoing harassment in the cluster environment . the morphology of sa  0426 - 002 is remarkably similar to their simulated dwarfs whose progenitors have small bulge components and prograde rotation . in their simulations , show that the scale - length of their discs will be reduced by 40 - 50% after several tidal interactions , and the remnants will lie on the fundamental plane for dwarf ellipticals .",
    "the size - luminosity relation for dwarf ellipticals is consistent with that of a population of truncated disc galaxies , further strengthening the argument that at least a fraction of des are tidally stripped disc galaxies .",
    "however , sa  0426 - 002 is extended for its luminosity on the size - magnitude relation presented in fig .",
    "[ sizemag ] , and appears not to fit this scenario .",
    "the fact that sa  0426 - 002 appears extended on the size - magnitude relation can be explained as we are likely seeing the dwarf early in its transformation from a disc to dwarf elliptical via harassment .",
    "the intra - cluster medium will rapidly ram - pressure strip a dwarf of its gas , and the dwarf will move to a fainter location on the size - magnitude relation , but it will have an extended size for its luminosity .",
    "sa  0426 - 002 s colour @xmath73 @xcite places it on the red - sequence for dwarf ellipticals presented in @xcite , and its keck - esi spectrum does not exhibit any emission lines consistent with ongoing star formation ( e.g. h@xmath12 ) .",

    "furthermore , sa  0436 - 002 lacks the spiral arms seen in these ring galaxies .",

    "gravitational torques from the bar can depopulate material at the co - rotation radius while building it up at the outer lindblad radius .",
    "thus both a bar and gas in a disk are required to form the lobes or wings seen in sa  0426 - 002 .",
    "we therefore hypothesise that the progenitor of sa  0426 - 002 was a dwarf disc galaxy , as gas is required to form the stars which make up the lobe features",
    ".    this ring galaxy morphology does not exclude ongoing tidal interactions ; indeed , such interactions can trigger bar formation in an infalling disc galaxy .",
    "mastropietro et al .",
    "( 2005 ) show that infalling discs will undergo major structural transformation , including strong bar formation and spiral patterns .",
    "these spiral features will be stripped away , with remaining material forming a ring structure around the bar .",
    "several galaxies in their simulations exhibit bar and ring features , and thus sa  0426 - 002 has characteristics of a ring galaxy formed via tidal harassment .",
    "further tidal interactions within perseus will likely remove the remaining ring structure , until only the bar of the galaxy remains , and such dwarfs are not uncommon in clusters ( e.g @xcite ) .",

    "the dwarfs lie on the size - magnitude relation for des , but sa  0426 - 002 has a large size for its magnitude , as it has ceased star formation but not yet been completely tidally stripped .",
    "we furthermore calculate central velocity dispersions and dynamical masses for three dwarfs in our sample : cgw38 , cgw39 , and sa  0426 - 002 , and all three dwarfs follow the @xmath0-luminosity relation for early - type stellar systems .",

    "<S> we present the results of a keck - esi spectroscopic study of six dwarf elliptical ( de ) galaxies in the perseus cluster core , and confirm two dwarfs as cluster members for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> all six des follow the size - magnitude relation for de / dsph galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> central velocity dispersions are measured for three perseus dwarfs in our sample , and all lie on the @xmath0-luminosity relation for early - type , pressure supported systems . </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore examine sa  0426 - 002 , a unique de in our sample with a bar - like morphology surrounded by low - surface brightness wings / lobes ( @xmath1  mag  arcsec@xmath2 ) . given its morphology , velocity dispersion ( @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 ) , velocity relative to the brightest cluster galaxy ngc  1275 ( 2711  km  s@xmath4 ) , size ( @xmath5  kpc ) , and srsic index ( @xmath6 ) , we hypothesise the dwarf has morphologically transformed from a low mass disc to de via harassment . </S>",
    "<S> the low - surface brightness lobes can be explained as a ring feature , with the bar formation triggered by tidal interactions via speed encounters with perseus cluster members . alongside spiral structure found in des in fornax and virgo , sa  0426 - 002 provides crucial evidence that a fraction of bright des have a disc infall origin , and are not part of the primordial cluster population .    </S>",
