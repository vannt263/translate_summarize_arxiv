    "the question here is that of the possible influence of a binary companion upon chemical peculiarity : does an ap or am star `` need '' a companion , or conversely , does it need to be single ? if there is a companion , what is its nature ?",
    "finally , fundamental parameters like mass , radius and age are better constrained for the components of binary stars than for isolated ones .",
    "the first systematic search for spectroscopic binaries among bp - ap stars was made by abt & snowden ( 1973 ) on a sample of 62 northern bright stars .",
    "they found a rate of binaries of only 20 percent among the magnetic ap stars and of 43 percent among hgmn stars ( the rate among normal stars is @xmath0 percent among normal b0 to m stars according to jaschek & gomez 1970 ) . aikman ( 1976 ) studied 80 hgmn stars ( instead of 15 for abt & snowden ) and confirmed a normal rate with 49 percent of binaries .",
    "the most recent and complete review is that of gerbaldi et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , while north ( 1994 ) published some new results on cool ap stars obtained with the coravel spectrovelocimeter .    on the basis of a sample of 25",
    "am stars , abt ( 1961 ) concluded that all are binaries , while abt & levy ( 1985 ) confirmed the high rate of binaries in a larger sample but also found some stars to be apparently single . for both ap and am stars ,",
    "only bright objects had been examined , so it was judged worthwhile to extend the survey to fainter and more numerous ones .",
    "this contribution is kind of a progress report on a survey of cool ap and am stars made with the coravel scanner in the northern hemisphere .",
    "all observations have been made at observatoire de haute - provence ( cnrs ) , france , with the coravel spectrovelocimeter ( baranne et al .",
    "1979 ) attached to the 1 m swiss telescope .",
    "the coravel scanner is optimized for cool stars , since the mask yielding the correlation function was made from the spectrum of the yellow giant arcturus .",
    "nevertheless , even stars with as hot a type as a0 may provide an autocorrelation dip , provided they rotate slowly enough and have enhanced metallic lines , which is precisely the case of many ( though not all ) ap and am stars .",
    "some well - known magnetic ap stars had been already measured by dr .",
    "michel mayor and coworkers as early as 1980 , but a more complete sample has been defined in 1985 from the following criteria : +  ap classification from e.g. the compilation of bertaud & floquet ( 1974 ) +  ap stars having geneva colours + ",
    "@xmath1  k according to geneva photometry + ",
    "declination @xmath2 +  @xmath3 ( some fainter stars included as well ) + this makes a total of 160 stars , but 48 of them proved to yield no autocorrelation dip because of fast rotation .",
    "indeed , the dip becomes too flat when @xmath4  kms@xmath5 , so that our sample is severely biased against high @xmath6 .",
    "this implies that the sample is also biased against periods shorter than about 4 days , if synchronism is assumed and if @xmath7 ( assuming also the orbital and equatorial planes to be coplanar ) ; systems with shorter periods may of course be observed , provided the inclination @xmath8 is small enough . among the 112 stars left , 13 are",
    "more probably am than ap stars because some early , unreliable classification sources were used , and a few more had a so wide and shallow correlation dip that they were observed only once or twice .",
    "therefore , we are left with 95 objects measured @xmath9 times ( typically 6 - 8 times ) over a time span of 12 to 17 years .",
    "systematic observations aimed at studying the binaries began in 1992 .",
    "the sample was defined as including +  northern objects +  metallic type f2 or later according to the compilation by hauck ( 1986 ) ; some objects from bidelman ( 1988 ) and from hynek ( 1938 ) were also included +  spectroscopic binaries with known orbits were excluded from the sample + as for the sample of ap stars , this one is biased against high @xmath6 ( therefore against very short orbital periods ) .",
    "but it is also biased , to some extent , against large @xmath10 amplitude , short period spectroscopic binaries , because objects with known and published orbits  which are more easily discovered when the period is short  are excluded .",
    "there are 230 objects in this sample , among which 158 have been observed to date .",
    "however , as many as 72 stars did not yield any autocorrelation dip , probably because of their high rotational velocity , so we are left with 86 objects .",
    "because of the inhomogeneous distribution of the elemental abundances on the surface of these stars , many of them are spectrum variables and present radial velocity variations due to rotation and abundance patches .",
    "this problem was avoided by abt & snowden ( 1973 ) by using hydrogen rather than metallic lines , but this is of course not possible with coravel .",
    "we are forced to identify these stars _ a posteriori _ , which is possible at least in part , thanks to some typical characteristics like wide and shallow correlation dip , short timescale ( a few days ) and relatively low - amplitude variability ( @xmath11  kms@xmath5 ) leading to a very small `` mass function '' if one tries to fit an orbit .",
    "taking this into account , one has 2 sb2 and 24 certain sb1 binaries among all 95 stars , which makes 27 percent .",
    "this percentage is smaller than that of normal stars ( @xmath0  % ) .    what is more interesting is that we found several long - period binaries but relatively few short period ones , which seems to confirm the lack of tight orbits among ap stars in spite of the bias we have against periods shorter than 3 - 4 days .",
    "this is entirely consistent with the results of gerbaldi et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , who found no orbital period shorter than about 3 days . however , we have found hd 200405 to be a spectroscopic binary with @xmath12  days , which is the shortest orbital period known among ap stars .",
    "figure 1a shows the @xmath13 vs. @xmath14 diagram for all known spectroscopic binaries with an ap stars , including 9 new orbits determined with coravel .",
    "this diagram resembles very closely that of normal stars ( see fig . 1 of gerbaldi et al .",
    "1985 ) , the only difference being the cutoff at about 0.5 .",
    "this cutoff suffices to explain the peculiar distribution of eccentricities of the ap binaries shown in fig .",
    "7 of gerbaldi et al .",
    "( 1985 ) : the lack of low eccentricities is linked with the lack of very short periods among si and srcreu binaries ; hgmn stars tend to have shorter periods than the latter , which also explains why there are more circular orbits among them .",
    "thus , the distribution of eccentricities does not appear to be peculiar in itself but only reflects the distribution of orbital periods .",
    "figure 1b shows the cumulative distribution of the mass functions of all binaries hosting an ap star ( including the hgmn , but the result would be the same without them ) .",
    "the continuous line is the result of a monte - carlo simulation where the mass ratio is a gaussian , as proposed by duquennoy & mayor ( 1991 ) for the nearby g dwarfs ; the mass function of the primaries is salpeter s one multiplied by the relative mass function of ap stars given by north ( 1994 ) .",
    "the observed and simulated distributions are in perfect agreement , suggesting that the unseen companion of binary ap stars has nothing exotic ; in particular , it is generally not a white dwarf .",
    "we have found as yet 52 binaries in our sample of 86 objects , i.e. 60 percent .",
    "29 orbits could be determined for 19 sb1 systems , 7 sb2 ones , one triple and one quadruple system .",
    "13 stars have not been measured often enough to conclude about their possible @xmath10 variability , but the remaining 21 seem to be constant , hence single ; however , additional observations may show them to be variable , if they belong to long - period , highly eccentric systems .",
    "figure 2 shows the @xmath15 diagram of our 29 orbits , which closely resembles that of the sample of abt & levy ( 1985 ) . here too , there is a lack of very short periods ( @xmath16  days ) : this can be understood from the fact that no am star has an equatorial velocity larger than 100  kms@xmath5 , while synchronism in such systems would force the primary to rotate faster .",
    "the distribution of periods is very similar to that of an earlier sample ( ginestet et al .",
    "1982 ) , with a maximum between 5 and 10 days .",
    "but , since observational biases tend to favour such short period systems , it remains necessary to accumulate observations on a long timescale . on figure 2",
    "are also shown the @xmath10 amplitudes @xmath17 vs. @xmath6 of the primaries for all 29 systems with a known orbit , as well as the @xmath6 of the 21 stars with an apparently constant @xmath10 .",
    "the upper envelope of the points is traced by sb2 systems with @xmath18 , 4 of which at least are already synchronized .",
    "the mass functions of sb1 am binaries are compatible with a main sequence cooler secondary , as is the case of ap binaries .",
