    "rankings of the elements of a set is a common daily decision making activity , such as , voting for a political candidate , choosing a consumer product , etc .",
    "so there is a huge literature concerning the analysis and interpretation of preference rankings data .",
    "however , if we trace back in time , we find that de borda ( 1781 ) was the first author , who outlined a simple well thought method based on a solid argument .",
    "borda , as a member of the french academy of sciences , criticised the plurality method of choosing a new academy member and suggested , what is known as the borda count(bc ) rule , to fully rank order ( seriate ) the @xmath0 candidates based on the preferences of the @xmath1 judges .",
    "bc has generated a large litterature , and this paper makes full use of it as much needed .",
    "let @xmath2 denote a set of @xmath0 alternatives / candidates / items , and @xmath3 a set of @xmath1 voters / individuals / judges . in this paper",
    "we consider the linear orderings / rankings / preferences , in which all @xmath0 objects are rank - ordered according to their levels of desirability by the @xmath1 voters .",
    "we denote a linear order by a sequence @xmath4 , where @xmath5 means that the alternative @xmath6 is preferred to the alternative @xmath7 let @xmath8 be the set of all linear orders on @xmath9 the cardinality of @xmath8 is @xmath10 .",
    "a _ voting profile _ is a function @xmath11 from @xmath3 to @xmath8 , that is , @xmath12    we denote by @xmath13 the set of permutations of the elements of the set @xmath14 the borda score is a function @xmath15 from @xmath8 to @xmath16 where for a linear ordering @xmath17 @xmath18 , borda assigned to the element @xmath19the score of @xmath20 , because @xmath19 is preferred to ( @xmath21 other alternatives , or equivalently it is the @xmath22th most preferred alternative . we denote @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a matrix having @xmath1 rows and @xmath25 columns , and @xmath26 designates the borda score of the @xmath27th judge s preference of the @xmath22th alternative .",
    "the average borda score of the elements of @xmath28 is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a column vector of @xmath31 s having @xmath1 coordinates .",
    "borda s count rule ( bc ) seriates / orders the @xmath0 elements of the set @xmath28 according to their average scores : @xmath32 means alternative @xmath22 is preferred to alternative @xmath27 .",
    "we define the reverse borda score to be a function @xmath33 from @xmath18 to @xmath16 where for a linear order @xmath17 @xmath34 , we assign to the element @xmath19the score of @xmath35 we denote @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a matrix having @xmath1 rows and @xmath0 columns , and @xmath38 designates the reverse borda score of the @xmath27th judge s preference of the @xmath22th alternative .",
    "the average reverse borda score of the elements of @xmath28 is @xmath39    we note that @xmath40and @xmath41      this example has two aims : first to make the notation clear ; second to show that traditional well established methods for rank data , such as distance and latent class based , may mask groups of small sizes in mixture models .",
    "table 1 introduces a well known data set first analyzed by croon ( 1989 ) ; the data derive from a german survey of 2262 rankings of four political items concerning inglehart ( 1977 ) s theory of postmodernism .",
    "the four items are : ( @xmath42 ) maintaining order in the nation ; ( @xmath43 ) giving people more to say in important government decisions ; ( @xmath44 ) fighting rising prices ; ( @xmath45 ) protecting freedom of speech .",
    "inglehart advanced the thesis that there is a shift in political culture in europe ; that is , some younger europeans have different political values than their fathers : he named the elder europeans as materialists , because after the first and second world wars , they valued mostly material security item ( @xmath44 ) and domestic order item ( @xmath28 ) ; while he named some of the younger generation as postmaterialists , because they valued much more human rights and political liberties item ( @xmath45 ) and democracy item ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "so in this example @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and the voting profile is displayed in the first two columns of table 1 ; similarly , table 1 displays the borda scores @xmath48 and the reverse borda scores @xmath49 .",
    "the average bc score @xmath50 and the average reverse bc score @xmath51 show that , the 2262 voters generally rank materialist items @xmath52  postmaterialist items @xmath53 .      + item & observed & & + ordering & & & b & c & d & & b & c & d + a@xmath54b@xmath54c@xmath54d & & & 2 & 1 & 0 & & 1 & 2 & 3 + a@xmath54b@xmath54d@xmath54c & & & 2 & 0 & 1 & & 1 & 3 & 2 + a@xmath54c@xmath54b@xmath54d & & & 1 & 2 & 0 & & 2 & 1 & 3 + a@xmath54c@xmath54d@xmath54b & & & 0 & 2 & 1 & & 3 & 1 & 2 + a@xmath54d@xmath54b@xmath54c & & & 1 & 0 & 2 & & 2 & 3 & 1 + a@xmath54d@xmath54c@xmath54b & & & 0 & 1 & 2 & & 3 & 2 & 1 + b@xmath54a@xmath54c@xmath54d & & & 3 & 1 & 0 & & 0 & 2 & 3 + b@xmath54a@xmath54d@xmath54c & & & 3 & 0 & 1 & & 0 & 3 & 2 + b@xmath54c@xmath54a@xmath54d & & & 3 & 2 & 0 & & 0 & 1 & 3 + b@xmath54c@xmath54d@xmath54a & & & 3 & 2 & 1 & & 0 & 1 & 2 + b@xmath54d@xmath54a@xmath54c & & & 3 & 0 & 2 & & 0 & 3 & 1 + b@xmath54d@xmath54c@xmath54a & & & 3 & 1 & 2 & & 0 & 2 & 1 + c@xmath54a@xmath54b@xmath54d & & & 1 & 3 & 0 & & 2 & 0 & 3 + c@xmath54a@xmath54d@xmath54b & & & 0 & 3 & 1 & & 3 & 0 & 2 + c@xmath54b@xmath54a@xmath54d & & & 2 & 3 & 0 & & 1 & 0 & 3 + c@xmath54b@xmath54d@xmath54a & & & 2 & 3 & 1 & & 1 & 0 & 2 + c@xmath54d@xmath54a@xmath54b & & & 0 & 3 & 2 & & 3 & 0 & 1 + c@xmath54d@xmath54b@xmath54a & & & 1 & 3 & 2 & & 2 & 0 & 1 + d@xmath54a@xmath54b@xmath54c & & & 1 & 0 & 3 & & 2 & 3 & 0 + d@xmath54a@xmath54c@xmath54b & & & 0 & 1 & 3 & & 3 & 2 & 0 + d@xmath54b@xmath54a@xmath54c & & & 2 & 0 & 3 & & 1 & 3 & 0 + d@xmath54b@xmath54c@xmath54a & & & 2 & 1 & 3 & & 1 & 2 & 0 + d@xmath54c@xmath54a@xmath54b & & & 0 & 2 & 3 & & 3 & 1 & 0 + d@xmath54c@xmath54b@xmath54a & & & 1 & 2 & 3 & & 2 & 1 & 0 + @xmath50 & & & 1.10 & 2.05 & 0.88 & & & & + @xmath51 & & & & & & & 1.90 & 0.95 & 2.12 +    table 2 provides a statistical summary of four methods of data analysis of table 1 .",
    "the first method suggested by inglehart is _ deductive and supervised _ ; it opposes to the other three methods , which are _ inductive , unsupervised and aim to validate inglehart s theory of postmaterialism , _ see also moors and vermunt ( 2007 ) .",
    "the other three methods are mixture models and they attempt to see if this data set confirms inglehart s theory of postmaterialism .",
    "the first one is by croon ( 1989 ) , who used a stochastic utility ( su ) based latent class model ; the second one by lee and yu ( 2012 ) , who used a weighted distance - based footrule mixture model ; and the third one is based on taxicab correspondence analysis ( tca ) , which is the topic of this paper . here , we provide some details on the statistics displayed in table 2 .",
    "\\a ) inglehart ( 1977 ) _ apriori _ classified the respondents into three groups : materialists , postmaterialists and mixed .",
    "his method of classification is based on partial rankings based on the first two preferred choices . here , we discuss each group separately .",
    "materialists are defined by their response patterns @xmath55",
    "@xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 , where the pair of materialist items @xmath59 are always ranked above the pair of postmaterialist items @xmath60 ; they make @xmath61 of the voters . in the ideal case",
    "we expect to have the average bc scores for the four items to be : @xmath62 and @xmath63 the corresponding observed values , displayed in table 2 , are ( very near to the ideal ones ) : @xmath64 and @xmath65    postmaterialists are defined by response paterns ( @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 ) , where the pair of postmaterialist items @xmath60 are always ranked above the pair of materialist items @xmath59 ; they make @xmath70 of the voters .",
    "the comparison of ideal and observed average bc scores , displayed in table 2 , show that : @xmath71 is very near to @xmath72 while @xmath73 is somewhat near to @xmath74 @xmath75 .",
    "the last group is named mixed by inglehart and is composed of the remaining sixteen response patterns ; they make @xmath76 of the voters . in the ideal case",
    "we expect to have the average bc scores for the four items to be : @xmath77 @xmath78 the corresponding observed values , displayed in table 2 , are ( somewhat near to the ideal ones ) : @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 and @xmath82    furthermore , based on the global homogeneity coefficient ghc in % : @xmath83 and @xmath84 inglehart s mixed group is not globally homogenous ; that is why we did not calculate its ghc index .",
    "the development of the ghc index and its interpretation will be done in section 3 .",
    "it is important to note that , the underlying hypothetical conceptual - structural model for this data is a mixture composed of three specific groups ( materialist , postmaterialist and mixed ) , which are explicitly characterized by inglehart .",
    "b , c ) given that , croon s su model and lee and yu s weighted distance - based footrule mixture model produced globally very similar groups , we present them together .",
    "a summary of croon s analysis can also be found in skrondal and rabe - hesketh ( 2004 , p.404 - 406 ) , lee and yu ( 2012 ) and in alvo and yu ( 2014 , p.228 - 232 ) .",
    "sections b and c of table 2 are taken from alvo and yu ( 2014 , p. 230 ) , who present a summary and a comparison of results from croon ( 1989 ) and lee and yu ( 2012 ) .",
    "the interpretation of the estimated parameters of the su model in table 2 is similar to the average borda score : for each group the score @xmath85 shows the intensity of the preference for that item in an increasing order .",
    "there are two kinds of estimated parameters in lee and yu s weighted distance - based footrule mixture model : the modal response pattern for each group is shown in the last column ; and the weight of an item @xmath86 , which reflects our confidence in the ranked position of the item in the modal response pattern , the higher value representing higher confidence .",
    "both methods find a mixture of three groups similar in contents : the first two groups represent materialists with @xmath87 and @xmath88 of the voters for the weighted footrule mixture model , and @xmath89 and @xmath90 of the voters for the su mixture model ; and the third group represents postmaterialists with @xmath91 of the voters for the weighted footrule mixture model , and @xmath92 for the su mixture model .",
    "lee and yu ( 2012 ) s conclusion is :  _ based on our grouping , we may conclude that inglehart s theory is not appropriate in germany_. this assertion shows that , the two well established traditional methods masked the existence of the mixed group as put forth by inglehart .",
    "\\d ) our approach , based on taxicab correspondence analysis ( tca ) , which is an l@xmath93 variant of correspondence analysis ( ca ) , discovers a mixture of three globally homogenous groups as advocated by inglehart : materialists with @xmath94 of the voters , postmaterialists with @xmath95 , and mixed with @xmath70 of the voters .",
    "furthermore , there is an outlier response pattern ( @xmath96 ) representing @xmath97 of the voters .",
    "so contrary to lee and yu ( 2012 ) s assertion , _ our results validates inglehart s theory of postmodernism for this data set_. probably , this is due mainly to the fact that tca is a directional method specially useful for spherical data : rank data with all its permutations is spherical by nature ( graphically , it is represented by a permutahedron ; see marden ( 2005 , figure 2.4 , page 11 ) or benzcri ( 1980 , p.303 ) .",
    "furthermore , based on the global homogeneity coefficient ghc in % : @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 we see that the materialist voters form much more globally homogenous group than the voters in the mixed group ; and the voters in mixed group are much more homogenous than the voters in the postmaterialist group . furthermore , our analysis clearly shows why the postmaterialists ( they have three poles of attractions as defined by marden ( 1995 , ch . 2 ) or benzcri ( 1966 , 1980 ) ) are much more heterogenous than the materialists ( they have two poles of attractions ) .",
    "more details on the local heterogeneities of each group will be presented later on in section 4 .",

    "our apparoach diverges from the traditional methods , because we discuss the concept of a mixture for rank data essentially in terms of its globally homogenous group components .",
    "we use the law of contradiction to identify globally homogenous components .",
    "for instance , by tca we were able to discover that the data set in table 1 is a mixture of three globally homogenous group components ( materialist , postmaterialist and mixed ) ; furthermore , each group component can be summarized by its average borda count ( bc ) score as its consensus ranking ; this is the first step in our procedure . in the second step , we look at local heterogeneities if there are any , given the globally homogenous component .",
    "this two step procedure produces finer visualization of rank data ; it is done via the exploratory analysis of rank data by taxicab correspondence analysis with the nega coding .",
    "also we introduce a new coefficient of global homogeneity , ghc .",
    "ghc is based on the first taxicab dispersion measure : it takes values between 0 and 100% , so it is easily interpretable .",
    "ghc measures the extent of crossing of scores of voters between 2 or 3 blocks seriation of the items where the borda count statistic provides consensus ordering of the items on the first axis .",
    "furthermore , to our knowledge , this is the first time that a tangible method has been proposed that identifies explicitly outliers in a rank data : neither the recently written monograph by alvo and yu ( 2014 ) , nor the much cited monograph of marden ( 1995 ) discuss the important problem of identification of outliers in rank data .",
    "we mention two publicly available written packages in r , that we used , _ rankclustr _ by jacques , grimonprez and biernacki ( 2014 ) , and _ pmr _ ( probability models for ranking data ) by lee and yu ( 2013 ) .    the contents of this paper are organized as follows : section 2 reviews the tca approach for rank data ; section 3 develops the new global homogeneity coefficient ghc ; section 4 presents the analysis of some well known rank data sets by tca ; and finally in section 5 we conclude with some remarks .",
    "we just want to mention that there is a large litterature in social choice theory or social welfare theory studying the properties of the bc . here , we mention some important contributions according to our personal readings .",
    "young ( 1974 ) presents a set of four axioms that characterize uniquely bc ; see also among others , saary ( 1990a ) and marchant ( 1998 ) .",
    "saari ( 1990b ) distinguishes two levels of susceptiblity of manipulation of voting theories : _macro_- where a large percentage of voters- , and _micro_- where a small percentage of voters - attempt to change the results of the elections . in data analysis ,",
    "a macro manipulation is equivalent to the existence of a mixture of groups of voters . while , a micro manipulation is equivalent to the existence of few outliers in the globally homogenous set of voters @xmath3 .",
    "further , saari concludes that among all positional voting systems , bc is the least susceptible to micro manipulation ; this assertion seems fully true in this paper .",
    "saari ( 1999 ) proves that bc is the only positional voting method that satisfies the property of _ reversal symmetry , _ which states that if everyone reverses all their preferences , then the final outcome should also be reversed .",
    "this property plays an important role in the nega coding of a rank data set before the application of tca .",
    "choulakian ( 2014 ) incorporates the bc to interpret the first principal factor of taxicab correspondence analysis ( tca ) of a nega coded rank data , see theorem 1 in the next section .",
    "additionally , this essay further extends and complements the ideas of global homogeneity and local heterogeneities for rank data .",
    "results of this section are taken from choulakian ( 2006 , 2014 ) .",
    "we start with an overview of tca of a contingency table ; then review the corresponding results concerning rank data .",
    "let @xmath171 be a contingency table cross - classifying two nominal variables with @xmath172 rows and @xmath173 columns , and @xmath174 be the associated correspondence matrix with elements @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the sample size .",
    "we define as usual @xmath177 , @xmath178 the vector @xmath179 the vector @xmath180 , and @xmath181 a diagonal matrix having diagonal elements @xmath182 and similarly @xmath183 let @xmath184    in tca we compute the following quadruplets for the two spaces , for @xmath185 : @xmath186 in the row space of @xmath187 and @xmath188 in the column space of @xmath189 . given that in ca and tca , the row and column spaces are dual to each other , we name the pair of vectors ( @xmath190 and @xmath191 @xmath192th principal axes , the pair ( @xmath193 and @xmath194 @xmath192th basic vectors of coordinates , the pair ( @xmath195 and @xmath196 @xmath192th vectors containg tca factor scores , and the nonnegative scalar @xmath197 the @xmath192th tca dispersion measure . the relations among the seven terms will be described in the next two subsections .",

    "if scenario 1 happens , then we will say that the data set is globally homogenous , because all voters have positive first tca factor scores ; that is , they are directionally associated because @xmath339 for all @xmath340 now by property c of theorem 1 , the nega row disappears and do not contribute to the higher dimensions ; thus the higher dimensions will exhibit either random noise or local heterogeneities of the voters represented by their response patterns .",
    "scenario 2 is the negation of scenario 1 , it corresponds to @xmath341then the results of tca of * y*@xmath321 are not interpretable by the law of contradiction : because some voters , say belonging to the subset v@xmath342 are directionally associated with the nega ; so to obtain interpretable results as described in scenario 1 , we eliminate the subset of voters v@xmath93 , and repeat the analysis till we obtain scenario 1 . if the number of deleted voters in v@xmath93 is small , we consider them outliers ; otherwise , they constitute another group(s ) of voters .",

    "rank data is much more structured than ratings data ; and this aspect will be used to propose a global homegeneity coefficient ( ghc ) of rank data .",

    "later on , de leeuw and mair ( 2009 ) applied multiple correspondence analysis , named also homogeneity analysis , to this data set with the scale level ordinal , and interpreted the obtained figure ( figure 8 in their paper ) with the following conclusion : the plot shows interesting rating twins  of departmental areas : @xmath492,@xmath493 , @xmath494,@xmath495 .",
    "@xmath496 is somewhat separated from the other areas .",
    "this assertion does not seem to be completely true , because of masking phenomenon .",
    "our tca analysis reveals that the 39 psychologists represent a mixture of two globally homogenous groups of sizes 23 and 16 as shown in figures 17 and 18 . in figure 17 , the following borda ordering of the areas can be discerned visually : @xmath497 the quantitative areas of psychology are preferred for this group .",
    "_ note that _ @xmath498 _  is not separated from the rest , it has a middle ranking_.    in figure 18 , the following borda ordering of the areas can be discerned visually : @xmath499 for this group of psychologists phy is the worse rated area ; further , qualitative areas are preferred for this group .    for the complete data set , @xmath500 , but",
    "the resulting tca map is not interpretable . for group 1 , @xmath501 , @xmath502 , so @xmath503 ; for group 2 , @xmath504 so @xmath505 so , group1 is somehat more globally homogenous than group 2 ; however both groups have a lot of inter block crossings .",
    "we also note that : @xmath506 and @xmath507 ; that is , the first tca dispersion measure of noninterpretable data is much smaller than the corresponding value of an interpretable maximal subset .",
    "this data set of preferences can be found in takane ( 2014 , p.184 - 5 ) : in 1978 delbeke asked 82 belgian university students to rank - order 16 different family compositions , where the 16 orders are described by the coordinate pairs @xmath508 for @xmath509 and , the index @xmath27 represents the number of daughters and the index @xmath22 the number of sons .",
    "this data set has been analyzed by , among others , heiser and de leeuw ( 1981 ) , van deun , heiser and delbeke ( 2007 ) , takane , kiers and de leeuw ( 1995 ) . in these studies ,",
    "the family composition ( 0,0 ) is considered an outlier because of its high influence and sometimes omitted from analysis . in our approach",
    "there are no outlier items , but voters can be tagged as outliers only by the law of contradiction .",
    "our results differ from theirs : we get a mixture of two globally homogenous groups of sizes 68 and 14 as shown in figures 19 and 20 , where points represent students and the symbol @xmath510 represents the family composition @xmath508 for @xmath511 .    in figure 19",
    ", we see that for this majority group of 68 students the least preferred combination of kids is ( 0,0 ) and the most preferred combination is ( 2,2 ) .",
    "the first borda axis opposes the combinations composed of ( 0 daughters or 0 sons ) to the combinations composed of ( at least one daughter or at least one son ) .",
    "further , we see that there is a bias towards boys : on the first axis the position of the point @xmath508 is always to the left of the point @xmath512 . for group 1 , @xmath513 , @xmath514 , so @xmath515 ; looking at the values of the students first factor scores , we notice 2 clusters : cluster 1 , characterized by small number of inter blocks crossings , is composed of 26 students with first factor score of @xmath516 8 students with @xmath517 and 5 students with @xmath518 this cluster , of proportion @xmath519 is represented by the dots making a vertical line in figure 15 .",
    "cluster 2 , characterized by large number of inter block crossings , are quite dispersed , having first factor scores between 0.4583 and 0.0750 .    in figure 20 , for the minority group of 14 students ( labeled on the biplot by their row numbers ) the least preferred combination of kids",
    "is @xmath520 and the most preferred combination is @xmath521 .",
    "the first borda axis opposes the combinations composed of @xmath522 and @xmath508 such that @xmath523 to the rest .",
    "further , in this group also there is a bias towards boys : on the first axis the position of the point @xmath508 is always to the left of the position of the point @xmath512 .",
    "for group 2 , @xmath524 and @xmath525",
    "here we conclude with a summary of some aspects of tca of nega coded rank data .",
    "we note that the rank data is spherical by nature , they are represented on a permutahedron ; so a directional method , like tca of the nega coded rank data , is able to discover some other aspects of the data , which are eclipsed or masked by well established methods , such as distance or latent class based methods . like occam s razor ,",
    "step by step , tca peels the essential structural layers ( globally homogenous groups ) of rank data ; it can also identify outliers in a group .",
    "we presented a new coefficient , @xmath399 , that measures the global homogeneity of a group .",
    "ghc is based on the first taxicab dispersion measure : it takes values between 0 and 100% , so it is easily interpretable .",
    "ghc takes into account the following two aspects of rank data : a ) how the items are partitioned into blocks by the first axis .",
    "b ) the extent of crossing of scores of voters among the partitioned blocks , where the borda count statistic provides consensus ordering of the items on the first axis .",
    "@xmath418 means that the partition of the set of items into 2 or 3 blocks is faithful and for all voters their orderings of the items are intra block permutations with no crossings between the blocks . for fully ranked data ,",
    "the lower bound of @xmath399 is positive but unknown being an open problem .",
    "as is well known , a coefficient in itself does not show important local details in a data set .",
    "we named these important local details , local heterogeneity ; and they appear in the higher dimensions of tca outputs : so it is important to examine the sequence of tca dispersion measures and the graphical displays as expounded and professed by benzcri .",

    "so for an odd number of items @xmath380 for @xmath540 , we have @xmath541    _ proof _ : a ) a _ faithfully homogenous group _ consists of one response pattern , and its borda score values for a complete linear order of @xmath0 items , without loss of generality by relabeling of the items , will be @xmath542 .",
