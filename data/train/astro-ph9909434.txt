    "for three decades considerable effort has been spent in obtaining samples of agn to investigate their cosmological evolution .",
    "this evolution is seen as a change in the luminosity function with redshift . in recent years",
    ", galaxy redshift surveys and x  ray cluster surveys have become sufficiently deep that the evolution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies can be examined in the same way as that of agn .",
    "quantifying and understanding the evolution of these populations is essential to modern cosmology .",
    "a number of methods exist for demonstrating and quantifying the cosmological evolution of a population , eg the @xmath1 method of schmidt ( 1968 ) or by comparison with monte carlo simulations ( la franca & cristiani 1997 ) .",
    "the simplest , most intuitive method is to construct a binned differential luminosity function in a number of redshift intervals . for flux limited samples ( which are the norm in evolution studies ) , this is usually done using the @xmath0 method ( eg maccacaro et al .",
    "1991 , ellis et al . 1996 ) .",
    "however , the @xmath0 method introduces a significant error for objects close to the flux limit , and hence is _ not _ the optimum method for constructing binned differential luminosity functions .",
    "we present a simple , alternative method which we show is superior to @xmath0 .",
    "this paper is laid out as follows .",
    "section [ sec : method ] describes both the @xmath0 method , and our new method , for constructing binned differential luminosity functions .",
    "the relative merits of the two methods are compared in section [ sec : advantages ] , and in section [ sec : sim ] a monte carlo simulation is used to demonstrate the improvement that our method offers over the @xmath0 method . in section [ sec : binmod ] we present a technique for comparing binned and model luminosity functions .",
    "we apply the two different methods to construct binned luminosity functions of the large bright qso survey sample in section [ sec : lbqs ] . in section [ sec : lbqsmod ] this sample is compared to one of the model luminosity functions and evolution laws from boyle et al .",
    "( 1991 ) using both an averaged luminosity function and using the method given in section [ sec : binmod ] .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we define the differential luminosity function @xmath2 , of any extragalactic population , as the number of objects per unit comoving volume per unit luminosity interval , i.e. @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the number of objects of luminosity @xmath5 found in comoving volume @xmath6 at redshift @xmath7 .",
    "we assume @xmath2 is a continuous function over the range of redshift and luminosity for which it is defined .",
    "the differential luminosity function is often defined as a function of logarithmic luminosity or ( by optical astronomers ) magnitude rather than luminosity .",
    "the method described here is equally applicable to luminosity functions defined in this way , with the appropriate substitution of ` log @xmath8 ' or ` @xmath9 ' where we have used ` @xmath5 ' .",
    "the @xmath0 method was originally proposed ( schmidt 1968 ) to measure space density ( @xmath10 ) ; the method was generalised for samples with multiple flux limits in avni & bahcall ( 1980 ) . if @xmath4 objects have luminosities and redshifts in the interval @xmath11 around the bin centre @xmath12 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the survey volume in which object @xmath15 with luminosity @xmath16 could have been detected and remained in the redshift bin @xmath17 .",
    "it is an unbiased estimator of the space density ( felten 1976 ) ; the main advantage of this method ( compared with simply dividing the number of objects found by the average volume searched ) is that it takes account of the fact that more luminous objects are detectable over a larger volume than the less luminous objects .",
    "the @xmath0 method is used to estimate @xmath2 by dividing the space density by the luminosity bin width .",
    "we will refer to the approximation of @xmath2 obtained using this method as @xmath18 : @xmath19      the luminosity function as defined in equation [ eq : phi1 ] is related to the expected number of objects found in any region @xmath20 of the volume - luminosity plane by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the bottom of the redshift interval @xmath17 and @xmath23 is the highest redshift possible for an object of luminosity l to be detected and remain in the redshift interval @xmath24 .",
    "angled brackets denote expectation value .",
    "if @xmath2 changes little over @xmath11 , then @xmath25 it follows that if @xmath4 objects have been found over some volume - luminosity region @xmath26 , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is our binned estimate of the luminosity function .",
    "consider a single bin , corresponding to the redshift - luminosity interval @xmath29 around the point ( @xmath30 ) , in a binned luminosity function constructed from a flux limited sample of objects .",
    "we assume that @xmath31 and @xmath17 are sufficiently small and/or that @xmath2 is a sufficiently slowly varying function of @xmath5 and @xmath7 that our single estimate of @xmath2 is appropriate over the whole interval .",
    "some portion of the region @xmath32 may represent objects which are fainter than the survey flux limit .",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : redlum ] where the curve @xmath33 represents the flux limit of the survey .    the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig : redlum]a is that region of the volume luminosity plane in the interval @xmath34 which has been surveyed .",
    "this shaded area corresponds to the double integral in equation [ eq : small ] . by definition ( equation [ eq : approx ] )",
    ", @xmath28 gives a good estimate to @xmath35 .",
    "the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig : redlum]b has an area equal to ( @xmath36 ) for object i , represented by the black spot .",
    "this area is clearly _ not _ the same as that of the surveyed region ( the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig : redlum]a ) and hence there is no guarantee that @xmath18 will give a good estimate of @xmath2 . however , there are two specific cases in which @xmath18 will always give a good estimate of @xmath2 :    \\1 ) the entire redshift , luminosity interval @xmath29 corresponds to objects brighter than the flux limit of the survey , i.e. in fig .",
    "[ fig : redlum ] the curve @xmath33 passes above the @xmath29 region . in this case ,",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38    \\2 ) @xmath31 is very small : @xmath39    note that even in these limiting cases , @xmath18 does not give a better estimate to @xmath2 than @xmath28 ; instead @xmath18 and @xmath28 have the same value in case 1 and converge to the same value in case 2 .",
    "case 1 generally applies for luminosity functions of objects which are much brighter than the flux limits .",
    "hence for luminosity functions in a number of redshift intervals , the two methods will produce the same results for the highest luminosity bins of any given redshift shell . at the lowest luminosities in each redshift shell , where objects are close to the survey flux limit and the shaded region of volume - luminosity space in fig.[fig :",
    "redlum]a is much smaller than the rectangular @xmath40 region , the two methods are likely to give the most different results . in all cases ,",
    "@xmath28 can be expected to give as good or better estimates for @xmath2 than @xmath18 , and is therefore the better estimator .      from the definition of @xmath28 in section [ sec : approx ] it is easily shown that the statistical uncertainty , @xmath41 , is given by : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the uncertainty on @xmath4 objects and can be calculated from poisson or gaussian statistics as appropriate .",
    "the statistical uncertainty on @xmath18 is harder to estimate , because each object makes a different statistical contribution .",
    "the uncertainty is typically estimated by the following expression : @xmath44 ( eg marshall 1985 , boyle et al .",
    "1988 ) but this assumes gaussian statistics and therefore is not appropriate for bins containing few objects .",
    "hence the uncertainty on @xmath28 is easily calculated for any number of objects within a bin , but the uncertainty on @xmath18 can only be properly estimated when there are many sources per bin .      the comparison so far and fig .",
    "[ fig : redlum ] has assumed the simple case of a survey with a single flux limit .",
    "however , many surveys have different flux limits for different parts of the survey area , and most luminosity function investigations combine different surveys with different flux limits . indeed , combining large area shallow surveys and small area deep surveys is currently the only practical way to obtain a luminosity function which spans a wide range of luminosities at a wide range of redshifts",
    ". the most efficient means to combine areas with different flux limits is to assume that each object could be found in any of the survey areas for which it is brighter than the corresponding flux limit .",
    "this is coherent addition of samples in the language of avni & bahcall ( 1980 ) . in this case",
    ", it is no longer true that only the lowest luminosity objects in each redshift shell are close to the flux limit , because objects of higher luminosity are close to the flux limit of the shallower survey areas .",
    "the problem with @xmath18 therefore affects luminosity bins that correspond to any of the survey flux limits , although the severity of the problem is watered down by the deeper survey areas .",
    "many surveys also have a _ maximum _",
    "flux limit beyond which sources are too bright to have been selected . in this case @xmath22 in equations [ eq : phi1 ] - [ eq : approxerror ] , as well as @xmath45 , is a function of l. as an illustration , if the curve @xmath33 in fig .",
    "[ fig : redlum ] were to represent a maximum ( rather than a minimum ) flux limit , objects would have to lie on the other side of the curve to be included in the survey . if the object ( black dot ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : redlum ] were shifted straight upwards to lie above the black line , it is now the shaded area of fig .",
    "[ fig : redlum]a subtracted from @xmath46 which corresponds to the double integral in equation [ eq : small ] , and the shaded area of fig .",
    "[ fig : redlum]b subtracted from @xmath46 . which corresponds to ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "just as for the minimum flux limit ( section [ sec : which ] ) , these two quantities are different , and there is no guarantee that @xmath18 will give a good estimate of @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , for surveys with both bright and faint flux limits , @xmath18 is likely to be inferior to @xmath28 at the highest as well as the lowest luminosity bins in each redshift shell .",
    "in this section we use a sample simulated by a monte carlo method to demonstrate the improvement that @xmath28 offers over the traditional @xmath18 .",
    "the simulation was performed using a two power law model x  ray luminosity function which is unchanging with redshift ( i.e. no evolution ) and a single flux limit .",
    "the monte carlo simulation produced a source list of @xmath48 sources .",
    "binned luminosity functions were produced for this simulated data in a range of redshift intervals using both methods .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bothsim ] , @xmath28 on the left and @xmath18 on the right .",
    "the model luminosity function is shown as a dashed line .",
    "the two methods are in exact agreement for the high luminosity points of each redshift interval , as expected from sec [ sec : which ] .",
    "however , for the lowest luminosity bins of the @xmath49 and @xmath50 redshift intervals @xmath18 is significantly smaller than the input model , while @xmath28 is a good representation of the input model . for the lowest luminosity bin of the @xmath51 redshift shell",
    "@xmath18 is larger than the input model .",
    "we therefore see that for objects close to the flux limit @xmath18 can be too small or it can be too large ; in simulations we have performed using different flux limits and luminosity functions @xmath18 is more frequently too small than too large .",
    "the luminosity function is frequently modelled as some analytical function ( eg a broken power law or a schechter function ) .",
    "models are sometimes fitted to the binned luminosity function and tested for goodness of fit using @xmath52 .",
    "more often the fit is made to the unbinned data by maximum likelihood ( crawford , jauncey & murdoch 1970 ) and models are tested for overall goodness of fit using a one or two dimensional kolmogorov smirnov test ( press et al .",
    "however , even in this latter case , comparison between the binned and model luminosity function is the usual recourse to find out _ why _ models are rejected , i.e. at which redshifts and luminosities the data and model are inconsistent .    in this comparison",
    ", a problem can arise that the model is a continuous function and ( for a steep luminosity function ) can span a rather large range of values within any one luminosity bin .",
    "similarly , any model luminosity function which is evolving with redshift can have a large range of values for a single luminosity over a redshift interval ( although this latter effect can be overcome if the evolution is known or assumed a - priori , eg mathez et al .",
    "1996 , kassiola & mathez 1990 ) .",
    "the binned luminosity function could be compared to the model luminosity function evaluated at some arbitrary ` middle point ' of each luminosity / redshift bin ; alternatively some weighted average of the model could be produced for each luminosity redshift bin .",
    "a more valid statistical approach is to compute the expectation value of the binned luminosity function from the model , for each redshift / luminosity bin . in this method ,",
    "a single , unique , model value is produced for each redshift / luminosity bin , which can be compared to the corresponding binned luminosity function data point .",
    "this allows the binned luminosity function to be compared with the model using a statistical goodness of fit test such as @xmath52 , and/or enables the fitting of a model to the binned luminosity function .",
    "this approach is illustrated in this section using the monte carlo simulated sample of section [ sec : sim ] .",
    "first , the formulas for expectation value are given .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath18 is given by : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are respectively the minimum and maximum luminosities of objects within the luminosity bin and @xmath57 is the probability density corresponding to an object of luminosity @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath57 is given by    @xmath58    where @xmath22 is the lower limit of the redshift shell and @xmath23 is the smaller of the maximum detectable redshift of an object of luminosity l and the top of the redshift shell .",
    "@xmath59 is given by equation [ eq : expectation ] .",
    "hence    @xmath60      from equations [ eq : expectation ] and [ eq : approx ] , the expectation value of @xmath28 is given by : @xmath62      [ sec : expsim ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bothexp ] @xmath64 and @xmath65 are shown with @xmath18 and @xmath28 of the monte carlo simulated sample of section [ sec : sim ] .",
    "unsurprisingly , the binned luminosity function of the monte carlo simulated sample is consistent with the expectation luminosity function derived from the input model .",
    "note that the systematic differences between @xmath18 and @xmath2 ( the turn down of @xmath18 at low luminosities in fig .",
    "[ fig : bothsim ] ) are reproduced by @xmath64 .",
    "hence it is in principle possible to compare and/or fit a model @xmath2 to a binned @xmath18 provided that the model is first transformed into @xmath64 .",
    "however , it is simpler to evaluate equation [ eq : modpredest ] for arbitrary @xmath66 than equation [ eq : modpredva ] , so we are again led to the conclusion that @xmath28 is superior to @xmath18 .",
    "to demonstrate the difference between binned luminosity functions produced using @xmath28 and @xmath18 , we now apply these two methods to real data . for this",
    "we have chosen the large bright qso survey ( hereafter lbqs , hewett , foltz & chaffee 1995 ) , the current largest single sample of qsos available .",
    "this is ideal because as samples become larger , the systematic problems with @xmath18 become larger than the statistical uncertainty associated with the data .",
    "note that the lbqs has a maximum flux limit as well as minimum flux limits ( see section [ sec : multiple ] ) ; these are given by hewett et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath18 are shown for the lbqs in fig .",
    "[ fig : lbqs ] for @xmath67 and h@xmath68=50 km s@xmath69 mpc@xmath69 .",
    "k - correction was performed using the composite spectrum of cristiani & vio ( 1990 ) .",
    "the contrast is striking : the @xmath18 binned luminosity function gives the misleading impression that evolution is complex and highly luminosity dependent while @xmath28 shows a much simpler picture of the evolution ; the latter could be described approximately by pure luminosity evolution .",
    "we now compare the binned luminosity function @xmath28 of the lbqs with a model luminosity function undergoing pure luminosity evolution . the model chosen is the @xmath67 model from boyle et al .",

    "the model is subject to pure luminosity evolution such that @xmath76=-22.5 - 8.625 log ( 1+@xmath7 ) , until @xmath77 after which @xmath76 remains constant at @xmath78 . the binned luminosity function is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lbqs7wins2 ] ; the different redshift shells have been placed in separate panels for clarity . for comparison",
    "the model is shown as both a volume - weighted average over each redshift shell ( dashed line ) , and as a set of expectation values @xmath65 calculated using equation [ eq : modpredest ] ( solid stepped line ) .",
    "the two arrows near the bottom of each plot show the position of the ` break ' luminosity of the model luminosity function at the top and bottom of the redshift shell .",
    "the advantage of comparing the binned luminosity function to expectation values is well demonstrated by the low luminosity bins of the upper four panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : lbqs7wins2 ] , in which the continuous volume weighted luminosity function makes the data look far more discrepant than it really is .    the model from boyle et al .",
    "( 1991 ) has already been compared to luminosity function of the lbqs , by hewett et al .",
    "these authors used cumulative 1/va luminosity functions in the same redshift shells as used here ; these were compared to the model predictions using kolmogorov smirnov tests in each redshift shell .",
    "their most important conclusion was that at @xmath79 the luminosity function systematically steepens relative to the model with increasing @xmath7 , implying that pure luminosity evolution is no longer a viable model for qso evolution .",
    "similar claims for other surveys have been made more recently by goldschmidt & miller ( 1998 ) , la franca & cristiani ( 1997 ) and by hawkins & veron ( 1995 ) .",
    "the binned luminosity function of fig .",
    "[ fig : lbqs7wins2 ] does not support this conclusion . instead",
    ", significant discrepancy between data and model at @xmath79 is always for fainter absolute magnitudes , at or below @xmath76 , and is always in the sense that the model overpredicts the number of low luminosity sources . to quantify this , we calculated the @xmath52 separately for bins brighter , and for bins fainter @xmath76 in the four redshift shells at @xmath79 .",
    "these are tabulated in table [ tab : chisq ] ; the lowest and highest luminosity bins of the @xmath49 redshift shell and the highest luminosity bin of the @xmath80 redshift shell have not been included because they contain too few objects for @xmath52 to be appropriate . at absolute magnitudes brighter than @xmath76",
    "the model is acceptable at 95% , overall and for each redshift shell individually . at fainter absolute magnitudes the model is significantly deviant for all but the @xmath80 redshift shell , and it is notable that in this @xmath80 shell the model shows the largest deficiency relative to the data at high luminosities .",
    "although the discrepancy between data and model at low luminosities is sufficient to reject the model at @xmath81 , there is no strong evidence that the luminosity function steepens relative to the model as redshift increases .",
