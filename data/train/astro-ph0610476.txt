    "in this work two transient x - ray pulsars , v0332 + 53 and 4u0115 + 63 , and two persistent ones , her x-1 and gx 301 - 2 , were studied .",
    "first two sources are members of high mass x - ray binary systems with @xmath0 class stars and demonstrate regular powerful outbursts in which their luminosities can reach @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "the distinctive peculiarity of both sources is that not only the main harmonics of the cyclotron resonance scattering feature ( crsf ) are registered in their x - ray spectra but also their higher harmonics .",
    "another two x - ray pulsars belong to different classes : gx 301 - 2  is a system with the supergiant companion , her x-1  is a low - mass x - ray binary sistem .",
    "spectra of both sources also include crsfs ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the pulsar v0332 + 53 was observed during a powerful outburst in 2004 - 2005 with the range of measured luminosities from @xmath3 to @xmath4 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "the significant number of v0332 + 53 observations carried out with the integral and rxte observatories allowed us to reconstruct the source spectrum at different phases of the outburst and to trace the evolution of its parameters in detail ( @xcite ) .    as a whole ,",
    "the pulsar spectrum during the outburst can be well described by a power law with an exponential cutoff at high energies modified by several harmonics of crsf ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) that is observed for several x - ray pulsars .",
    "but the behaviour of the cyclotron line in this source deserves a special attention , as its position is not a constant .",
    "the line energy dependence on the source luminosity obtained from _",
    "integral _ and _ rxte _ data is shown in fig.1 by dark triangles and squares , respectively .",
    "the formal fitting of this dependence with a linear relation gives @xmath5 kev , where @xmath6  the source luminosity in units of @xmath7 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "assuming that for low luminosities the emission come practically from the neutron star surface ( see below ) we can estimate the magnetic field on the surface @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10  are the neutron star radius and mass , respectively .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that there is a critical value of the luminosity ( @xmath11 erg s@xmath2 ) dividing two accretion regimes : the regime when the influence of the radiation on the falling matter is negligible and the regime when this influence is significant . when @xmath12 , the matter free - fall zone is extended almost down to the surface of the neutron star . in the opposite case ( @xmath13 ) ,",
    "observed for v0332 + 53 , the radiation - dominated shock rises high above the neutron star surface .",
    "almost all of the kinetic energy of the infalling gas is lost in this shock , and is then emitted laterally by the sides of the accretion column .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that the height of the shock @xmath14 changes practically linearly with changing of the accretion rate , @xmath15 , in a wide range of values @xmath16 , i.e. the shock height grows linearly when the source luminosity increases and can reach several kilometres for high luminosities .    in case of v0332 + 53 the maximum relative change of the line energy and , consequently , the corresponding magnetic field is about @xmath17% .",
    "in an approximation of a dipole field of the neutron star , it corresponds to a @xmath18% relative change of the height @xmath19 where the feature is formed . at the end of the outburst",
    ", the source luminosity falls to @xmath3 erg s@xmath2 , the column height decreases and we detect the emission coming virtually from the neutron star surface .",
    "taking the neutron star radius @xmath20 cm we can estimate the maximum height @xmath21 m , that is much less than the shock height @xmath14 expected for such luminosities .",
    "due to the fact that only a small fraction of the energy accumulated in the accreting matter is emitted at the shock ( @xcite ) and its main part goes into the extended sinking zone below the shock the registered emission is a superposition of emissions from different heights above the neutron star surface .",
    "therefore , we can consider the height @xmath19 as a some averaged or `` effective '' height of the formation of the cyclotron feature not coinciding with the position of the shock itself .",
    "the spectrum of 4u0115 + 63 also can be well fitted by the power law model with an exponential cutoff at high energies and it also contain crsf with higher harmonics .",
    "the energy of this feature depends on the source luminosity , but the picture of these changes is not as clear as in case of v0332 + 53 .",
    "the cyclotron line energy and source luminosity time dependences obtained during the outburst of 4u0115 + 63 in feb - apr 1999 ( see @xcite and references there ) are presented in fig.2 .",
    "both observed dependences can be roughly divided in two parts : where these dependences can be approximated by smooth law ( high luminosity state , between mjd 51240 and 51270 ) and where they become nearly linear or even constant for the cyclotron energy ( below @xmath22 erg s@xmath2 , after mjd 51270 ) .",
    "the physical reasons of such a behaviour will discussed in details in future ( @xcite ) . assuming that for the low luminosity state the cyclotron feature is formed near the neutron star surface than we can estimate the magnetic field of the neutron star using the equation ( 1 ) , as @xmath23 .",
    "the observed strong spectral and geometrical changes of accretion column might lead to significant changes in other observable characteristics of pulsars , for example , in the shape of the pulse profile .",
    "two three - dimensional pulse profiles ( distributions of pulse intensities along the pulse phase and energy relative to the mean value ) for different states of v0332 + 53 , @xmath24 ( left part ) and @xmath25 erg s@xmath2 ( right part ) , are shown in fig.3 ( upper panel ) .",
    "the red and blue stripes represents regions of lower and upper wings of cyclotron lines . in bottom panels of fig.3 two - dimensional distributions of pulse profile intensities",
    "are demonstrated by different colors and levels of equal intensities .",
    "it is interesting to trace changes of the maximum intensities for both observations : in the high state the positions of both peaks are practically unchanged with the energy , although their relative intensity is changed ; in the low state the profile became single - peaked at energies just below the cyclotron line with a drastic transition to the double - peaked just above the line energy ( fig.3 ) .",
    "the exact explanation of the pulse profile is complicated task , many geometrical and physical processes can affect to the pulse profile changes .",
    "for example , the gas accretion stream flowing along the alfven surface covers only a part of this surface . spinning with the same angular velocity as the neutron star it can periodically shade from the observer different parts of emission regions , that can explain the different intensity of peaks in the pulse profile and their changes with the energy ( @xcite )",
    ".        the observed changes of the source pulse profile near the cyclotron frequency is difficult to describe in detail within the framework of current models .",
    "naturally , they can be connected with peculiarities of the radiation beaming near the cyclotron frequency ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in particular , as e.g. @xcite showed , the cyclotron line shape demonstrates a strong angular dependence .",
    "the plasma is more transparent at large angles than at small ones for energies below and above the line energy .",
    "therefore photons will escape predominantly in the directions of large angles , i.e. the radiation beaming in different energy channels near the cyclotron line will be strongly different . but the exact physical picture is unclear yet .",
    "two - dimensional distributions of pulse profile intensities for 4u0115 + 63 obtained with the rxte observatory are shown in fig.4 . in the bright state",
    "the profile is double - peaked up to @xmath26 kev ( pulses at phases @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) ; with the decreasing of the source luminosity the relative intensity of a second peak is decreasing and the profile become single - peaked .",
    "the observed pulse profile dependences on the energy and luminosity can be roughly understood in terms of a simple geometrical model : the angle between the rotation axis and direction to the observer has a such value that allow us to see one accretion column entirely , but another column is partially obscured by the neutron star surface .",
    "thus , the hottest parts of the second column are obscured and the corresponding peak in the profile should disappear with the growing of the energy . in terms of this model",
    "the decreasing of the second peak with the luminosity decreasing can be explained by the decreasing of the accretion column height and consequently by the obscuration of its colder parts .",
    "naturally for the accurate description of the pulse profile behaviour more complicated models are needed .",
    "for example it is important to know the beam function of the accretion column at different luminosities and energies . due to the closeness of radiating areas to the neutron star surface",
    "some relativistic effects ( e.g. , light bending ) should be taken into account also .",
    "thus , the construction of even simple model is very complicated task .",
    "nevertheless , if the above assumptions are correct they can give us the possibility to estimate some basic geometrical parameters of this x - ray pulsar .",
    "we did not detect such drastic changes of pulse profile near the cyclotron frequency as in case of v0332 + 53 , but the preliminary analysis shown that the profile demonstrates a wavy behaviour with the energy : near the main cyclotron frequency and its harmonics the phase of the first peak in the profile is slightly shifting `` down '' ; between crsf harmonics the phase is shifting `` up '' ( fig .",
    "4 ) .      two another well known x - ray pulsars with cyclotron features in their spectra , her x-1 and gx 301 - 2 , were studied for the searching of the pulse profiles changes with the energy .",
    "the intensity maps of pulse profiles of these pulsars in high intensity states are presented in fig .",
    "5 . in the left panel",
    "the pulse profile of gx 301 - 2 obtained with the ibis telescope onboard the integral observatory in the hard energy band ( 18 - 60kev ) is shown . the her x-1 pulse profile obtained with the rxte observatory in the 3 - 40 kev energy band",
    "is shown in the right panel .",
    "the preliminary analysis shows that as in the case of 4u0115 + 63 no drastic changes of the pulse profile with the energy and near the cyclotron frequency are observed .",
    "we presented results of the analysis of the _ integral _ and _ rxte _ data obtained for two transient sources , v0332 + 53 and 4u0115 + 63 , during the outbursts , and two persistent ones , gx 301 - 2 and her x-1 .",
    "the most important and interesting results are : +  for the first time we studied in detail the evolution of the cyclotron line energy in the spectrum of v0332 + 53 with the source luminosity and showed that it is linearly increasing with the luminosity decreasing in the same way as the change of the height of the accretion column ;     the strong pulse profile changes with the luminosity , especially near the cyclotron line , are revealed for v0332 + 53 ;     it was shown that for 4u0115 + 63 the cyclotron line energy depends on the source luminosity by a complex manner ;     the possible wavy behaviour of 4u0115 + 63 pulse profile with the energy is revealed ;     the preliminary results on gx 301 - 2 and her x-1 does not revealed evident changes of their pulse profiles with the energy .",
    "detailed studies of the population of pulsars with crsfs are in a progress .",
