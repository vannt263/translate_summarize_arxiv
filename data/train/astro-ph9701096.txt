    "although the rotational behavior of pulsars has been monitored in detail for decades , some aspects of how an isolated pulsar spins down are unresolved .",
    "questions surround the manner in which angular momentum is removed from the system and how the different components of the neutron star interior couple to one another . in particular , most pulsars do not slow in a regular fashion , but undergo variations in their spin rates in the form of glitches and timing noise . except for such timing irregularities ,",
    "a pulsar is expected to slow down steadily .",
    "for example the _ vacuum dipole model _ , a theory of rotational energy loss to magnetic dipole radiation ( @xcite ) , predicts @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the pulsar rotational velocity .",
    "this spin - down law gives a braking index of @xmath3 .",
    "timing irregularities make meaningful determination of @xmath4 and hence @xmath5 difficult or impossible in most cases .",
    "consequently , the only braking indices available until recently were those for three very young , relatively quiet pulsars : the crab pulsar ( @xmath6 ; @xcite ) , psr b1509 - 58 ( @xmath7 ; @xcite ) , and psr b0540 - 69 ( @xmath8 ; @xcite ) .",
    "these braking indices are in significant disagreement with the vacuum dipole model expectation .",
    "plasma in the pulsar magnetosphere could carry angular momentum from the star and alter the magnetic structure from the dipolar configuration , giving a braking index as low as one ( see , , @xcite ) .",
    "another possibility is that the magnetic moment of the star changes in time , through either a change in the surface field strength ( see , , @xcite ; @xcite ) or the angle between the magnetic and spin axes ( see , , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in the crab pulsar , persistent increases in the spin - down rate",
    "are observed to accompany glitches ( see , , @xcite and table 1 ) .",
    "this phenomenon can in principle be explained by either a sudden change in the external torque or in the moment of inertia acted upon by the torque . in this letter",
    "we suggest that the persistent increases in the crab s spin - down rate reflect sudden , glitch - induced reorientations of the star s magnetic axis that increase the external torque .",
    "recently , lyne  ( 1996 ) attempted to separate the glitch activity of the vela pulsar from its underlying spindown , and obtained a surprisingly small value of @xmath4 .",
    "if this small @xmath4 reflects the true spin - down of the star , the braking index is only @xmath9 .",
    "this braking index , far smaller than those for younger pulsars , suggests that the braking index decreases with time .",
    "this possibility forces reconsideration of traditional determinations of pulsar ages that assume constancy of the pulsar magnetic moment . in this letter",
    "we demonstrate that shifts in @xmath0 at a rate similar to that inferred for the crab account naturally for vela s low braking index .",
    "the crab pulsar has produced 6 glitches since 1969 ( @xcite ) . during each glitch ,",
    "the spin rate suddenly increases by @xmath10 ( see column 2 of table 1 ) . immediately following each glitch , the magnitude of the spin - down rate @xmath11 is larger than before .",
    "most of the excess spin - down rate decays within weeks of the glitch .",
    "however the long - term behavior , on which we focus here , shows a persistent shift ( or _ offset _ ) @xmath12 in the spin - down rate that does not decay ( see column 3 of table 1 ) .",
    "this type of behavior was most striking after the 1989 glitch , in which the persistent shift in spin - down rate was especially large ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . following the glitch , the spin - down rate remained larger than that expected from an extrapolation of the preglitch behavior .",
    "in all the glitches , the shifts in the spin - down rate persisted to the next glitch and were of the same sign .",
    "the cumulative effect of these offsets amounted to a total increase in the star s spin - down rate of 0.07% over 23 years .",
    "any proposed mechanism for these persistent spin - down rate offsets must conserve angular momentum .",
    "the evolution of the angular velocity @xmath13 of a rigidly rotating pulsar under an external torque @xmath14 , is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the total moment of inertia .",
    "if the star contains a fluid component that is not coupled to the external torque , as discussed below , @xmath16 is less than the star s total moment of inertia .",
    "a persistent shift in the spin - down rate could arise through an increase in the external torque ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or from a change in @xmath16 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . the external torque could vary through either a change in the angle @xmath0 between the spin and magnetic axes , or in the magnitude of the surface magnetic field , @xmath17 .",
    "gradual growth of the surface field has been considered ( see , , @xcite ; @xcite ) , however , no mechanism has been suggested by which the surface field could suddenly increase as a consequence of a glitch .",
    "ruderman ( 1976 ) has suggested that stresses exerted on the inner crust by the superfluid crack the crust and move plates of material toward the equator . because the magnetic field is frozen to the highly - conductive crust",
    ", such plate tectonics would increase @xmath0 .",
    "plate tectonic activity could also redistribute matter in such a way as to change the orientation of the principle axes of the star .",
    "as the star relaxes to a new rotational state , @xmath0 can change , though the direction of change is not obvious .",
    "we now discuss whether the crab pulsar s behavior can be understood in terms of sudden changes in @xmath0 . for illustration",
    "we use the vacuum dipole model , in which the rotational evolution is given by @xmath18 if the alignment angle @xmath0 changes by @xmath19 , the spin - down rate of the star shifts by an amount @xmath20 the average rate of change of @xmath21 due to glitches over 23 years of observations is ( @xcite ) @xmath22 to account for these persistent shifts , @xmath0 must increase at an average rate of @xmath23 the growth time @xmath24 is thus @xmath25 yr . at this rate of change , the entire angular shift over the entire @xmath26 yr lifetime of the star would be only @xmath27 rad , considerably less than the upper bound of @xmath28 .    another way for the star s spin - down rate to increase is through a decrease in the effective moment of inertia @xmath16 on which the external torque acts .",
    "such a change could occur through either a structural change of the star , , the star become less oblate , or through a decoupling of a portion of the star s liquid interior from the external torque .",
    "the change in the spin - down rate , from eq .",
    "[ [ cons ] ] would be @xmath29 a decrease in @xmath16 solely through structural readjustment can not produce the behavior seen in the crab pulsar . in this case , angular momentum conservation would require the star to always spin _ more _ rapidly than had the glitch not occurred .",
    "the large persistent shifts following the 1975 and 1989 glitches , however , eventually caused the star to spin _ less _ rapidly than had the glitch not occurred ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in principle , the crab s spin - down rate offsets could be due to decoupling of a portion of the star s superfluid interior from the external torque ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , though quantitative agreement of this model with the data has yet to be demonstrated .",
    "the high levels of glitch activity and timing noise typically exhibited in older pulsars have prevented the determination of their braking indices .",
    "recently , however , lyne  ( 1996 ) attempted to separate the glitch activity of the vela pulsar from its underlying spin - down to obtain the average @xmath4 .",
    "the inferred braking index is @xmath9 , significantly smaller than the braking indices measured in the younger crab , psr b1509 - 58 , and psr b0540 - 69 , suggesting evolution of @xmath5 . unlike the determinations of the braking indices in these young pulsars , which utilized data intervals that were free of glitches , the measurement of vela s @xmath5 employed data containing many glitches .",
    "hence , the value of vela s @xmath5 includes the effects of any shifts in @xmath11 that might arise from glitches . here",
    "we note that the small braking index for vela reported by lyne  ( 1996 ) could be due to increases in @xmath0 of the sort suggested by the crab s persistent shifts in spin - down rate .",
    "suppose that a pulsar spins down according to a braking law of the form @xmath30 where , for the vacuum dipole model , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "if @xmath33 depends on time , the observed value of the braking index , @xmath34 , will differ from @xmath35 appearing in eq .",
    "[ [ generallaw ] ] .",
    "if @xmath33 is changing at an average rate @xmath36 , differentiating eq . [ [ generallaw ] ] in time gives ( see , , @xcite ) @xmath37 where @xmath38 , the conventional spin - down age , differs from the true age if @xmath33 is evolving .",
    "hence , if @xmath33 is increasing with time , @xmath5 will be less than @xmath35 . in the context of the vacuum dipole model , the growth rate of @xmath0 required to explain the braking index of vela is @xmath39 giving a growth time @xmath40 yr .",
    "this rate is remarkably close to the average rate of orientation shifts inferred from the persistent spin - rate shifts observed in the crab ( see eq .",
    "[ crabshifts ] ) .",
    "the growth time is consistent with vela s age , as @xmath41 .    the changes in @xmath0 at the average rate given in eq .",
    "[ [ vela_alpha_rate ] ] may occur suddenly , coincident with glitches , as we are suggesting for the crab . since the average glitch interval in vela is @xmath42 yr , each glitch would then produce a persistent offset in the spin - down rate of @xmath43 , comparable to the shifts seen in the crab .",
    "these persistent shifts would be very difficult to see in vela ; long after a glitch , @xmath11 typically differs from the average spin - down rate by @xmath44% , much larger than the expected persistent shifts assuming the changes in @xmath0 occur at glitches .    in principle , vela s lower braking index could be due to a decreasing moment of inertia ( @xcite ) . in this case , @xmath45 in the vacuum dipole model , and the required rate of change is @xmath46 if @xmath5 remains low over much of the star s life ( @xmath47 ) , then the relative change in the moment of inertia would be of order unity ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "explanations based on either decoupling of the interior liquid or changes in the star s structure can not accommodate such drastic decreases in @xmath16 . in the standard picture of the neutron star interior ,",
    "the only liquid component that can be decoupled is the inner crust neutron superfluid , which comprises at most 10% of the star s total moment of inertia .",
    "furthermore , structural changes in @xmath16 are limited by the deviation from sphericity due to rotation , which is @xmath48 for vela .",
    "we have shown that the persistent offsets in the crab s spin - down rate following glitches could be due to sudden glitch - induced increases in the angle @xmath0 between the rotational and magnetic axes . moreover , a similar average growth rate of @xmath0 accounts for the very low braking index of the vela pulsar . in the vacuum dipole model ,",
    "the characteristic growth times of @xmath0 in these two pulsars are @xmath49 yr for the crab and @xmath50 yr for vela .",
    "lyne and manchester ( 1988 ) found that pulsars older than @xmath51 yr tend to have smaller @xmath0 than younger pulsars .",
    "if our suggestion that @xmath0 grows in young pulsars is correct , and the trend found by lyne and manchester ( 1988 ) is statistically significant , then the evolution of @xmath0 is not monotonic .",
    "that is , in young pulsars ( @xmath52 yr ) the orientation angle @xmath0 may grow , whereas in older pulsars it becomes smaller .",
    "it is possible that changes in @xmath0 are responsible for @xmath53 for the crab , psr b1509 - 58 , psr b0540 - 69 . since the data intervals used to determine these braking indices contained no glitches , to explain these values of @xmath5 the alignment angle @xmath0 would have to grow _ between _ glitches .    the changes in @xmath0 inferred from the crab s persistent offsets might produce measurable changes in the pulse profile . for example",
    ", a change of @xmath0 at a glitch could change the duration of the line - of - sight s traverse through the pulse emission cone .",
    "the magnitude of the associated change in the total pulsed flux is @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the half - width of the emission cone .",
    "taking @xmath56 , determined from the radio data ( @xcite ) , @xmath19 for the 1989 glitch ( which exhibited the largest observed offset ) is @xmath57 rad ( see eq .",
    "[ alphashift ] ) . from these numbers we estimate the relative change in pulsed flux to be @xmath44% .",
    "we estimate a somewhat smaller change , @xmath58% , using the value @xmath59 obtained by yadigaroglu and romani ( 1996 ) in their analysis of gamma ray and radio data .",
    "such flux changes may be measurable in either x - ray or optical bands .",
    "sekimoto  ( 1995 ) , using ginga , found an upper limit on the change in the pulsed x - ray emission ( 1 - 6 kev ) across the 1989 glitch of @xmath60% .",
    "moreover , jones , smith and nelson ( 1980 ) , found that the pulsed optical emission varied by @xmath44% over 7 yr .",
    "we thank g. baym for helpful comments on this manuscript , and a. g. lyne for providing us with data from the 1989 crab glitch .",
