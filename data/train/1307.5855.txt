    "scientists across several disciplines have recently become interested in the possibility that quantum - mechanical phenomena may play a role in the energy - transfer processes of photosynthetic organisms and synthetic light - absorbing materials .",
    "this interest was generated primarily by the observation of oscillations in cross peaks present in two - dimensional electronic spectra ( 2d es ) @xcite .",
    "+ oscillations during the waiting time in a 2d es experiment represent the phase evolution of coherent superposition states generated during the experiment ; more specifically , these oscillations are directly related to the phase evolution of off - diagonal elements in the density matrix , known as _ coherences_. coherences can be vibrational , electronic , vibronic , etc . in character . in the simple case of a coupled heterodimer , coherent phase evolution of eigenstate superpositions",
    "is indicative of what can be thought of as _ coherent energy transfer _ between the individual systems ; a basis transformation from the energy eigenbasis of the coupled system into the subsystem basis reveals oscillating populations between the subsystems .",
    "these populations oscillate as long as the peaks in a 2d spectrum do .",
    "in particular , electronic coherences have been the focus of recent attention with respect to photosynthetic systems .",
    "such systems are far more complicated than a coupled - heterodimer , however , it is tantalizing to ask whether oscillations observed in 2d es are also indicative of _ coherent energy transfer _ in photosynthetic systems @xcite .",
    "+ in contrast to the above discussion , conventional energy transfer between molecules is considered to be an _",
    "incoherent _ process .",
    "there are many senses in which the term `` incoherent '' applies in this context and , therefore , it may not be immediately obvious how to interpret the notion of _ coherent _ energy transfer . before we motivate our discussion of 2d es , we elaborate on the context in which the terminology is used .",
    "+ we begin by considering a collection of atoms that are isolated from the environment and separated by distances smaller than the wavelength of visible light . in quantum electrodynamics , atoms couple to the vacuum modes of the universe , and an initial excitation on one or more of these atoms will result in energy transfer between them .",
    "the energy transfer is mediated via virtual photons , where the term `` virtual '' arises because such photons can not be observed .",
    "such a mechanism is often considered to be radiationless , however , it was shown by andrews _ et al . _",
    "@xcite that it is simply the short - range limit of a unified theory of resonant energy transfer which includes emission of a photon by one atom followed by absorption by another .",
    "the rate of energy transfer is highest when the atoms are on resonance and drops off very quickly off - resonance .",
    "this process is equivalent to frster s phenomenological treatment of the radiationless mechanism for energy transfer @xcite which is now known as frster resonance energy transfer ( fret ) .",
    "+ interactions with an environment can lead to fluctuations in energy levels .",
    "this not only reduces the rate of energy transfer between resonant atoms , but also facilitates energy transfer between off - resonant atoms by sometimes bringing them into resonance . + for molecular systems , a number of additional physical processes come into play .",
    "after excitation , a molecule can lose energy to its surroundings , transitioning from a higher - energy vibrational state to a lower - energy one while still remaining in the electronic excited state .",
    "after excitation , excited energy levels can also shift due to reorganization of atomic nuclei .",
    "these processes result in a shift in the emission energy with respect to the excitation energy , collectively known as the _ stokes shift_. the combined effect of these processes is that fret between molecules tends to be unidirectional : energy can transfer from high energy molecules ( known as _ donors _ ) to low energy molecules ( known as _ acceptors _ ) due to high overlap between fluorescence spectra of donors and absorption spectra of acceptors ; however , energy tends not to transfer from acceptors to donors due to the low overlap between fluorescence spectra of acceptors and absorption spectra of donors .",
    "+ despite all these nuances , the energy - transfer mechanism is always the same : energy transfer mediated via photons . whether this is thought of as a coherent or incoherent process is largely a consequence of how terminology evolved within different disciplines .",
    "we now turn our attention to discussing such possible interpretations .",
    "+ the most obvious way in which this type of energy transfer could be considered incoherent is due to the lack of coherence between the radiation field that excites the donor and the radiation field that is emitted by the acceptor .",
    "this can be seen even with a semiclassical treatment .",
    "if we consider the field quantum - mechanically , we can identify other possible definitions . to do so",
    ", it will be instructive to review the distinction between _ state coherence _ and _ process coherence _ in quantum mechanics .",
    "this was done in the introductory section of a recent paper by kassal _",
    "@xcite , also in the context of energy transfer in photosynthesis . + a quantum state is described by a density matrix @xmath0 .",
    "off - diagonal elements of @xmath0 contain phase information and are therefore usually called `` coherences '' .",
    "state coherences are basis - dependent : a state diagonal in one orthonormal basis will not be diagonal in any other . a basis - independent concept of state coherence can be defined in terms of the state purity @xmath1 $ ] , where a completely mixed state is proportional to the identity and contains no coherences .",
    "the state is then fully coherent when @xmath2 and fully incoherent if @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the dimension of the system .",
    "a state can also be considered incoherent if it leads to a zero expectation value of some interesting dynamical quantity , which is directly related to whether the state is diagonal in the relevant basis .",
    "for example , the expectation value of the electric field operator with respect to a coherent state @xmath5 is equal to @xmath6 , while the expectation value of the electric field operator with respect to a thermal state @xmath7 is equal to zero . during the energy - transfer process discussed above",
    ", the expectation value of the electric field is always zero , and therefore this process could be thought of as incoherent by this definition as well .",
    "+ however , in both cases above , our conclusions of incoherence were based on the coherence properties of the _ state _ of the radiation field and not on the energy - transfer _ process _ itself . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the coherence of a process depends on the degree to which the evolution of an open quantum system is dominated by the unitary part or the dissipative part . in a molecular system , a process is more coherent the more strongly the molecules are coupled to each other , relative to the strength of their coupling to the environment . using this definition of process coherence ,",
    "fret is considered incoherent because the donor and the acceptor are more strongly coupled to the environment than they are to each other , meaning that the slow transport between them can be described by rate equations .",
    "however , if two molecules are strongly coupled , unitary evolution dominates and coherent population oscillations are possible .",
    "it is in this context that the term _ coherent energy transfer _ is intended .",
    "+ cross - peak oscillations in 2d spectra of light - harvesting complexes persist on time scales that indicate partial process coherence and therefore partially - coherent energy transfer .",
    "process coherence is independent of the coherence properties of the light used to excite the system ; coherent light is simply a convenient method with which to probe the coherence of the process .",
    "incoherent light has now also been used to perform 2d es experiments @xcite .",
    "+ these measurements have motivated theoretical work on energy - transfer dynamics in the intermediate coupling regime @xcite where the intermolecular coupling is comparable to the molecule - environment coupling , as well as quantum - information aspects such as entanglement @xcite .",
    "the convergence of nonlinear optical spectroscopy and quantum optics on the topic of energy transfer has brought to light several disparities between the conventions of the two fields . here",
    "we provide a systematic treatment of nonlinear optical spectroscopy measurements in terminology which should be familiar to researchers in quantum optics .",
    "+ we begin by providing a historical account of 2d es in section [ sec : history ] , then review how spectroscopists understand 2d es from a classical - physics perspective in section [ sec : interpretation ] , setting the scene for the semiclassical treatment of four - wave mixing used in 2d es in section [ sec : theory ] .",
    "we use a heterodimer system as a model in section [ sec : example ] to explore basic themes of 2d es ; we include a simple phenomenological treatment of nonunitary processes such as dephasing and population relaxation , as well as data from 2d es measurements of a gaas quantum well sample to further illustrate these themes .",
    "we finish in section [ sec : diagrams ] by describing the diagrammatic method known as double - sided feynman diagrams and relating it to the derivation in previous sections .",
    "coherent multidimensional optical spectroscopy  of which 2d es is but one embodiment  is a type of nonlinear optical spectroscopy measurement . for broad treatments of nonlinear optics and nonlinear optical spectroscopy methods , we refer readers to texts including those by boyd @xcite and mukamel @xcite .",
    "we refer readers to the following texts @xcite and review articles @xcite for treatments more specific to coherent multidimensional optical spectroscopy .",
    "+ 2d es was developed in the late 1990s @xcite , concurrently with 2d ir @xcite .",
    "many aspects of the technique are related to nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) methods developed decades earlier @xcite .",
    "2d es has now been used to study a variety of systems including atoms @xcite , molecules @xcite , molecular aggregates @xcite and related nanostructures @xcite , biological pigment - protein complexes @xcite , and semiconductor nanostructures @xcite . methods for measuring multidimensional spectra using entangled photons",
    "have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the method has found widespread adoption because it gives information beyond that which can be obtained from more conventional femtosecond transient - absorption measurements @xcite .",
    "+ the main advantages of 2d es are that it can separate inhomogeneous and homogeneous line - broadening contributions and it can expose microscopic couplings directly through the presence of cross peaks .",
    "the observation of cross peaks  and oscillating cross peaks in particular  in 2d es measurements of pigment - protein complexes has been extensively discussed @xcite .",
    "2d es is becoming more widespread , and claims arising from 2d es measurements have led to interest by the quantum - optics community .",
    "the way in which many spectroscopists understand four - wave mixing signals is based on classical optics concepts including interference patterns and diffraction . + before discussing 2d es , we begin with the more intuitive transient - absorption spectroscopy , a type of pump - probe spectroscopy .",
    "this technique is one type of four - wave mixing measurement in which only two femtosecond pulses are used .",
    "a pump pulse excites the sample , and after a delay , @xmath8 , a weaker probe pulse measures the result .",
    "one can obtain spectral information about the pump - induced absorption change by frequency - resolving the probe ; one can also obtain temporal information by repeating the measurement at many values of @xmath8 . formally , the pump pulse contributes two field - matter interactions simultaneously ( one with positive wave vector and the other with negative wave vector ) such that the total signal is emitted in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "the wave vector @xmath10 is related to wavelength of light via @xmath11 .",
    "+ in many ways , the common implementation of 2d es is an extension of transient absorption .",
    "the method not only allows access to the same temporal and emission spectral information contained in a transient - absorption spectrum , but also it allows access to the excitation spectrum .",
    "this leads to a 2d ` map ' correlating excitation and emission frequencies for each @xmath8 delay value .",
    "the main technical distinction between transient absorption and 2d es is that the single pump pulse is replaced by a pair of pump pulses . by stepping the delay between the pair of pump pulses followed by fourier transformation with respect to the time delay between them",
    ", one can work out the excitation spectrum .",
    "we depict the signal - generation process in fig . [",
    "fig : signal_generation ] .",
    "the input beams are arranged on the corners of a square .",
    "this is called the box geometry , from the term boxcars used in many coherent anti - stokes raman scattering experiments . with three intense femtosecond pulses",
    ", many optical effects can be produced . because of the pulse energies used and the detection of signal in a specific , phase - matched direction , @xmath12 , the femtosecond pulse in each beam contributes one field - matter interaction to the signal - generation process .",
    "the fourth field - matter interaction is the signal emission .",
    "both transient absorption and 2d es use a four - wave mixing process , which involves the third - order nonlinear optical susceptibility @xmath13 .",

    "it is possible  and sometimes advantageous  to perform 2d es in the transient - absorption geometry @xcite . + typically in 2d es the two pump beams cross at a small angle @xcite .",
    "when the relative optical phase between the two pulses is stable , they form a stable interference pattern in the electromagnetic field as depicted in fig .",

    "the periodicity of the fringe is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the excitation wavelength and @xmath20 is the crossing angle between the two pump beams @xcite .",

    "+ in this paper , we focus on modelling diffraction due to the electronic grating and how this diffraction changes as a function of the pulse timing adjustments and sample parameters .",
    "often the electronic excitation leads to nuclear motion , resulting from one or more physical processes . in impulse - stimulated thermal scattering",
    ", the bright areas of the sample absorb light which gets converted into heat during radiationless relaxation .",
    "the temperature of the medium therefore becomes modulated across the grating resulting in a long - lived refractive index grating .",
    "in addition , a difference - frequency mixing process can excite coherent vibrational oscillations in what is known as impulsive - stimulated raman scattering .",
    "+ for simple systems , as the time delay between the pumps and the probe ( again denoted @xmath21 to be consistent with the transient - absorption measurement ) increases , the amount of light diffracted into the signal direction decreases exponentially as the kinetics of the sample decay the system back to the ground state .",
    "moreover , for a given @xmath21 value , as the time delay between the two pump pulses , @xmath22 , is varied , the phase and amplitude of the imprinted grating pattern will change . in the limit where the two pump pulses are further apart than the duration of the optical polarization induced in the material by each pulse ( which can be longer than the pulse duration ) , no interference occurs and therefore no grating pattern is induced . for small @xmath22 values , the phase of the interference pattern changes , and this phase shift can be measured if one can resolve the phase of the emitted signal field .",
    "this is a key feature of 2d es measurements .",

    "the different experiments are just different pulse - timing sequences or projections through the three dimensions of the signal , @xmath25 . in most cases , because the dynamics during time period @xmath21 are either near zero frequency ( for population decays ) or low frequencies , that dimension is usually displayed in the time domain .",
    "the coherent oscillations during time periods @xmath22 and @xmath26 are much faster in comparison , at optical frequencies , so those are usually displayed in the frequency domain . in other words , the signal is usually displayed as some projection of @xmath27 . + when a sequence of intense femtosecond pulses interacts with the sample , a great variety of events can transpire .",
    "we are interested in the small subset of events that leads to coherent signal generated in the phase - matched direction by the induced electronic grating .",

    "furthermore , we hope that this will expand the utility of this technique to areas not traditionally studied with 2d es , such as bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
