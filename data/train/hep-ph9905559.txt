    "since the discovery of a serious spin problem , the internal spin structure of the nucleon has been a popular topic .",
    "using many experimental data on @xmath5 , we have a rough idea on the longitudinally polarized parton distributions .",
    "on the other hand , the transversity distributions @xmath6 have not been measured at all because they can not be measured in the usual inclusive deep inelastic scattering .",
    "they are expected to be measured in the transversely polarized drell - yan process at rhic and semi - inclusive process at hera .",
    "we should try to understand the properties of @xmath6 before the experimental data are taken .",
    "the @xmath7 evolution of the transversity distributions has been already investigated in detail including the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) effects @xcite . using these results",
    ", we investigate the antiquark flavor asymmetry in the transversity distributions @xcite .",
    "now , it is well known that light antiquark distributions are not flavor symmetric @xcite according to the nmc , na51 , e866 , and hermes experimental data . in particular , the recent e866 result revealed the @xmath8 dependence of the ratio @xmath9 by measuring the drell - yan proton - deuteron asymmetry .",
    "the antiquark flavor asymmetry in the polarized distributions is also expected to exist .",
    "however , it is not known at this stage except for a few theoretical predictions @xcite . because the polarized antiquark distributions are measured at rhic ,",
    "it is important to investigate a possible asymmetric distribution . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the transversity flavor asymmetry by using the nonperturbative models .",
    "then , obtained results are used for calculating the transverse double spin asymmetry @xmath3 at a rhic energy .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the flavor asymmetry effects on the drell - yan proton - deuteron asymmetry @xmath10 .",
    "the contribution from the perturbative qcd is considerably small @xcite as far as the @xmath7 evolution in the range @xmath11 gev@xmath12 is concerned .",
    "therefore , we expect the antiquark flavor asymmetry comes almost from the non - perturbative mechanisms . as such mechanisms , a meson - cloud and a pauli exclusion principle models are typical in discussing the unpolarized @xmath13 asymmetry @xcite .",
    "we try to apply these mechanisms to the polarized distributions @xcite .",
    "since we have no experimental information about transversity distributions , we calculate the flavor asymmetry in the longitudinally polarized distributions at first .",
    "then , we assume the transversity distributions are equal to the longitudinal distributions at small @xmath7 by using the prediction of the nonrelativistic quark model .",
    "first , we discuss the meson - cloud model . in this model",
    ", we calculate the meson - nucleon - baryon ( mnb ) process in which the initial nucleon splits into a virtual meson and a baryon , then the virtual photon from lepton interacts with this meson . because the lightest vector meson is the @xmath14 meson",
    ", we calculate the @xmath14-meson contribution to the flavor asymmetry in the polarized distributions .",
    "the contributions from this kind of process can be expressed by the following convolution integral :    @xmath15    where the function @xmath16 represent the @xmath14-meson momentum distribution due to the @xmath14nb process and the function @xmath17 represent the polarized antiquark distribution in the @xmath14 meson . in our analysis ,",
    "nucleon and @xmath18 are taken into account as a final state baryon and all the possible @xmath14nb processes are considered .",
    "since the dominant contribution comes from the @xmath19 meson which has a valence @xmath20 quark , the meson - cloud contribute @xmath21 excess over @xmath22 .",
    "note that the @xmath14-meson effects are also studied in ref .",
    "@xcite by using the slightly different method from ours in the calculation of @xmath16 .",
    "next , we discuss the pauli exclusion model . because there already exist some studies on this mechanism in the polarized case @xcite , we simply use their results . according to the su(6 ) quark model , we have each quark state probability as @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 in the proton spin - up state . since the probability of @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) is much larger than that of @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) ,",
    "it is more difficult to create @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) sea than @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) sea because of the pauli exclusion principle . then , assuming that the exclusion effect is the same as the unpolarized , @xmath31 and a similar equation for @xmath32 , we have @xmath33 and @xmath34 . as a result , we find that the flavor asymmetry from this mechanism .    the both models should be valid only at small @xmath7 , so that the grsv parametrization at @xmath7=0.34 gev@xmath12 is chosen in our calculation .",
    "the obtained results for the @xmath35 distribution are shown at @xmath7 = 10 gev@xmath12 in figure 1 . from this figure",
    ", we find that both model predictions have similar tendency , namely , @xmath1 excess over @xmath2 .",
    "however , the meson contributions seems to be smaller than those of the exclusion model .",
    "recently , a flavor asymmetric distribution was proposed by analysing deep inelastic semi - inclusive data @xcite .",
    "our distributions are consistent with their result because the accuracy of the present semi - inclusive data is insufficient to find accurate flavor asymmetry .",
    "the transversity distributions will be studied by measuring the drell - yan transverse double spin asymmetries @xmath3 at rhic . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the flavor asymmetry effects on @xmath3 .",
    "we calculate @xmath3 with nlo contributions at the rhic energy @xmath36 gev by using the flavor symmetric and the flavor asymmetric parton distributions .",
    "the results are shown in figure 2 as the function of dimuon mass square .",
    "the solid , dashed , and dotted curves represent the flavor symmetric , meson - cloud , and pauli exclusion results , respectively . from this figure , we find that the magnitude of @xmath3 is about 1% in the dimuon mass region @xmath37 gev@xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , we find that the flavor asymmetric results are considerably different from the flavor symmetric one . however , the differences are not enough to find the flavor asymmetry effects because we may change the magnitude of the transversity distributions so as to agree with the experimental data .",
    "although the longitudinal flavor asymmetry @xmath38 should be investigated by the @xmath39 production processes , the transversity asymmetry can not be measured by the @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , we should think about possible measurements in order to investigate the @xmath40 asymmetry .",
    "as the alternative candidate for finding the transversity flavor asymmetry @xmath0 , we propose to use the polarized proton - deuteron drell - yan process in combination with the polarized pp process @xcite .",
    "recently , a general formalism for the polarized pd reactions was completed @xcite . from their parton model analysis ,",
    "the drell - yan proton - deuteron asymmetry @xmath10 is expressed by transversity distributions in the proton and the deuteron . if we neglect the nuclear effects in the deuteron and assume the isospin symmetry , the drell - yan p - d asymmetry in the large @xmath41 ( = @xmath42 ) region is approximately given by the following equation :    @xmath43   \\left[1 + \\frac{\\delta_{_t}\\overline{d}\\left(x_b\\right ) } { \\delta_{_t}\\overline{u}\\left(x_b\\right)}\\right ] } { 2 \\left[1 + \\frac{1}{4 }   \\frac{\\delta_{_t}d\\left(x_a\\right)}{\\delta_{_t}u\\left(x_a\\right ) }   \\frac{\\delta_{_t}\\overline{d}\\left(x_b\\right ) } { \\delta_{_t}\\overline{u}\\left(x_b\\right)}\\right ] } \\ , , \\ ] ]    where the @xmath44 and @xmath45 represent the momentum fractions in the hadron a ( proton ) and the hadron b ( deuteron ) . from this equation ,",
    "the ratio clearly becomes one if @xmath46 is equal to @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , if we find that the data which is different from one , it suggests the flavor asymmetry .",
    "we calculate the ratio @xmath10 by using the flavor symmetric and the flavor asymmetric distributions @xcite . as a result",
    ", we find that the flavor symmetric result becomes almost one in the large @xmath41 region as discussed above although the meson - cloud and the pauli exclusion results are significantly different from one . from this analysis ,",
    "we conclude that the drell - yan p - d asymmetry is very useful for investigating the light antiquark flavor asymmetry in the transversity distributions .",
    "we mention that the p - d asymmetry should be also used for studying the flavor asymmetry in the longitudinally polarized distributions in a similar way . at this stage , there are no project to measure the polarized proton - deuteron drell - yan process .",
