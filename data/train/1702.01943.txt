    "ultracold atoms have added a completely new toolset to the study of quantum many - body systems by allowing direct imaging of density and momentum distributions .",
    "this led to the observation of striking features such as the bimodal momentum distribution signifying the onset of bose - einstein condensation @xcite or vortex lattices in rotating superfluids@xcite .",
    "ultracold atoms have also been used for precision measurements such as the extraction of the equation of state @xcite from an accurate measurement of the density distribution of the system . the most common method to measure such density distributions is absorption imaging : the atoms are illuminated with a short pulse of resonant light and the shadow cast by the atoms is imaged onto a camera .",
    "the fraction of light transmitted through the system decreases exponentially according to the beer - lambert law , provided the atomic transition is not saturated . in this case the density distribution integrated along the imaging direction @xmath0 can be extracted from a relative measurement which compares images with and without atoms . hence , no knowledge of the absolute intensities is required .    however , absorption imaging with intensities well below the saturation intensity has clear limitations .",
    "one prominent issue is the imaging of optically dense clouds , where the number of photons transmitted through the sample and hence the signal - to - noise ratio becomes very small .",
    "this can either be solved by using techniques such as phase contrast imaging @xcite or by simply saturating the transition so that more photons are transmitted@xcite .",
    "imaging in the saturated regime is also helpful when a high spatial resolution is desired . to this end , it is essential to minimize the motion of atoms caused by the recoil from scattered photons during the imaging pulse .",
    "the motional blurring is minimized by utilizing short imaging times with high intensities .    for absorption imaging with higher intensities",
    "a new scale appears : the saturation intensity @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that the column density can no longer be determined from a purely relative measurement of two intensities .",
    "rather , the absolute intensities transmitted with and without atoms present have to be known in order to extract an atomic density .",
    "however , determining the imaging beam intensity @xmath2 at the position of the atoms is prone to systematic errors .",
    "additionally , imperfect polarization of the imaging light can lead to a reduced scattering cross - section and hence an increased effective saturation intensity @xmath3 .    here , we present a novel technique which allows for a precise and robust calibration of high intensity absorption imaging .",
    "it is based on measuring the momentum transferred to the atoms by the imaging pulse which is directly proportional to the number of scattered photons .",
    "the beam intensity @xmath2 for which the transferred momentum and hence the photon scattering rate is equal to half its maximum value corresponds to the effective saturation intensity @xmath3 .",
    "measuring the momentum transfer also allows to determine the polarization purity of the imaging light at the position of the atoms as well as the detuning @xmath4 .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in section two a brief review of strong saturation imaging is given and section three describes the experimental setup . in the fourth section , we describe our method to measure the momentum transfer and apply it to determine @xmath5 , the correct detuning and the polarization purity of the imaging beam . in section five we summarize the results .",
    "here , we provide a short summary of the theory of resonant saturated absorption imaging . when the saturation of an optical transition becomes relevant , the beer - lambert law is modified to @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the atom density and @xmath8 the intensity at position @xmath9 of the imaging light propagating along the @xmath10-direction @xcite . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the effective cross - section and effective saturation intensity . here , a parameter @xmath13 was introduced to capture effects of non - perfect polarization or magnetic field orientation which reduces the cross - section and saturation intensity in a two - level system from its ideal values @xmath14 and @xmath15@xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath16 is planck s constant , @xmath17 the speed of light , @xmath18 is the wavelength and @xmath19 the natural linewidth of the imaging transition .",
    "integration of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : modlambertbeer ] ) along @xmath10 then yields the optical column density @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 being incident and transmitted intensities , respectively . when the intensities are small compared to the saturation intensity the linear term can be neglected and we recover the simple beer - lambert law which only depends on relative intensities . however , for higher intensities the linear term becomes significant and the intensities have to be known in units of the effective saturation intensity .",
    "furthermore , the intensities @xmath23 and @xmath24 read out from a pixel @xmath25 of the camera are given in units of count rates , which will be denoted @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the following .",
    "the count rate is related to the intensity by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the area of a camera pixel , @xmath30 the magnification of the imaging system , @xmath31 the transmission through the imaging system , @xmath32 the quantum efficiency and @xmath33 the conversion factor between counts and photo - electrons of the camera .",
    "expressing eq .",
    "( [ eqn:2ddensity ] ) in counts @xmath34 leads to @xmath35 it becomes apparent that with an independent measurement of @xmath36 there is no need to know @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the problem hence reduces to finding the number of counts @xmath36 on the camera corresponding to the effective saturation intensity and the effective cross - section @xmath37 .",
    "knowledge of @xmath37 is also necessary for low intensity imaging .",

    "the experimental setup is designed to produce , manipulate and image two - dimensional superfluids of @xmath38li atoms with high spatial resolution@xcite .",
    "the imaging system along the @xmath10-direction has a numerical aperture of 0.62 and thus a very limited depth of field of about .",
    "hence , short imaging pulses are required to minimize the motion along the optical axis as well as the random walk in @xmath39-plane during the imaging process in order to avoid motion blurring . in our @xmath38li experiment",
    "we typically use imaging pulses with @xmath40 .",
    "this causes motional blurring of about @xcite . under this condition",
    "it is therefore advantageous to use high intensity imaging to maximize the number of scattered photons , since the signal - to - noise ratio in absorption imaging is typically limited by photon shot noise .",
    "the quantization axis for the atoms is given by a magnetic field parallel to the optical axis .",
    "therefore , the absorption cross - section on the @xmath41s@xmath42 , f=1/2 to @xmath41p@xmath43 , f=3/2 imaging transition is maximal for circularly polarized light",
    ".    the imaging laser light is generated by a frequency stabilized narrow linewidth diode laser which is frequency shifted by an acousto - optical deflector ( aod ) in double pass configuration .",
    "this aod setup enables chirping the imaging frequency with high ramp rates exceeding using a direct digital synthesis ( dds ) frequency source .",
    "the imaging light intensity is controlled via a sample and hold feedback loop .    for the measurements presented in the following , we work with about atoms per spin state in the two lowest hyper fine states of @xmath38li at a magnetic offset field of .",
    "the atoms are magnetically trapped in the radial direction ( trapping frequencies @xmath44 ) . the tight confinement in @xmath10-direction is realized by a highly elliptic dipole trap featuring a trapping frequency of about .",
    "in order to avoid multiple scattering effects during the calibration measurements the optical density @xmath45 along the @xmath10-direction as well as the atomic density @xmath46 is chosen to be low .",
    "we note that optically thin samples @xmath47 are only required for calibration .",
    "once the effective saturation count rate @xmath36 is known , optically thick samples can be imaged by using high intensities to saturate the imaging transition .",
    "however , to avoid collective scattering effects during the imaging , the condition that the inter - particle spacing @xmath48 has to be larger than the imaging wavelength @xmath18 still has to be fulfilled@xcite .",
    "there exist two closely related approaches to determine @xmath3 or @xmath36 in the literature @xcite , which rely on taking absorption images of clouds with constant atom numbers while scanning over a wide range of imaging intensities @xmath21 . for an assumed value of @xmath49 the total atom number @xmath50 for each intensity",

    "we accelerate the cloud of atoms in @xmath10-direction by illuminating it with a short pulse from the main imaging beam after the dipole traps are switched off .",
    "the momentum transferred to each atom during the pulse is proportional to the number of scattered photons .",
    "subsequently , the transferred momentum is determined by recording the flight distance of the accelerated cloud after some time of flight with an auxiliary imaging system along an orthogonal direction .",
    "the momentum transferred to the atoms saturates with increasing intensity @xmath21 since the resonant photon scattering rate @xmath52 saturates according to @xmath53 here , @xmath19 is the natural linewidth of the imaging transition and @xmath54 denotes the on resonant saturation parameter which is given by the ratio of the imaging beam intensity to the effective saturation intensity .",
    "the intensity for which the atoms traveled half their maximum flight distance corresponds to @xmath3 .",
