    "the research field of nanoplasmonics has grown substantially in past few years due to tremendous progress in fabrication techniques and optical characterization @xcite .",
    "while the linear plasmonics is still enjoying significant interest , the field of nonlinear plasmonics @xcite recently began to attract attention @xcite . moreover the new type of nanomaterials using strong coupling of molecular excitons and plasmons has also been extensively discussed@xcite .",
    "an obvious extension of various nonlinear spectroscopy techniques@xcite to the domain of plasmonics is also an ongoing effort @xcite .",
    "free induction decay is a well - documented phenomenon that was first demonstrated in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and is also observed in optics @xcite .",
    "a population of two - level emitters can exist in which all emitters have the same _ central _ transition energy but each is detuned by some amount from this central energy due to inhomogeneous broadening , which can result from conditions such as doppler shift in individual gas molecules or variations in electric field from point to point in a solid @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic polarization of an ensemble of emitters is the sum of each individual contribution from every emitter in the ensemble . given that the transition energies of the emitters in the ensemble are described by a distribution",
    ", each individual emitter will oscillate at a frequency that is slightly different from the others after the system is pumped by a strong incident pulse . as a result ,",
    "all of the emitters will oscillate in phase at first , but they will all ( for a realistic number of emitters ) dephase within a characteristic inhomogeneous lifetime and , if left alone , never rephase again @xcite .",
    "however , for times less than the natural lifetime of the emitter , each emitter is still oscillating .",
    "one can in principle invert the dephasing process by applying a second pump in the form of @xmath0 pulse .",
    "the oscillations then all _ run in reverse _ , resulting in a subsequent rephasing . the ensemble polarizes once again , and a photon echo signal is observed .",
    "this technique is widely used in chemistry and is referred to as photon echo spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneous effects due to variations in an emitter s surroundings cause each emitter to oscillate at a slightly different frequency than the others , and photon echo spectroscopy _ removes _ this effect .",
    "any remaining dephasing is irreversible by the echo technique , and is revealed as diminished intensity of the echo @xcite .",
    "for example , as the delay in applying the @xmath0 pulse increases , the natural lifetime of the emitters causes all of their oscillations to decrease , resulting in an echo with lower intensity .",
    "thus a time and frequency structure of a detected photon echo contains all information about a probed system .    additionally , the recovery of a signal after dephasing offers prospects for memory storage . in @xcite ,",
    "the optical properties are copied to a spin system whose lifetime is much longer than that of the optical system thus extending the duration of the system s memory .",
    "our major interest in this paper is to test a concept of photon echo in strongly coupled exciton - plasmon systems in order to understand any new features unique to the strong coupling regime .",
    "first , we briefly overview the numerical model used .",
    "next , we consider the application of a @xmath1 pulse to a 1-d ensemble followed by application of a @xmath0 pulse generating a photon echo signal .",
    "the density of molecules in this ensemble is varied and the strength of the echo is considered in terms of the transmission and reflection of the ensemble .",
    "finally , we investigate the photon echo of two exciton - plasmon systems , namely a periodic array of slits and a core - shell nanoparticle , each combined with inhomogeneously broadened molecules .",

    "the field - free hamiltonian for a molecule with energy index k is @xmath9 @xmath10 corresponds to the index of a specific energy in the distribution and @xmath11 is the transition energy of a given molecule .",
    "we consider an ensemble of two - level molecules having a particular distribution of transition energies ( inhomogeneous broadening ( ib ) ) .",

    "the numerical convergence is achieved for the grid with @xmath44 nm and a time step of @xmath45 .",
    "it should be noted that inevitable discretization of the transition energy distribution ( [ gaussian ] ) results in unphysical rephasing which must be carefully monitored in all simulations in order to avoid spurious numerical artifacts . in brief , after initial excitation of an ensemble of non - interacting molecules , free induction decay occurs followed by a rephasing after a delay which is proportional to the @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the discretization step in ( [ gaussian ] ) .",
    "the rephasing is obviously unphysical for a realistic number of molecules ( i.e. continuous transition frequency distribution with the revival time being infinite @xcite ) . in all our simulations we use an energy step @xmath48 no larger than @xmath49 ev , corresponding to a revival time of @xmath50 fs or longer",
    "first we consider non - interacting molecules driven by external incident field , the polarization current @xmath51 is used as an indication of rephasing .. we employ the two - pulse pump - probe photon echo sequence as illustrated in fig .",

    "@xmath52 corresponds to the time between the maximum of the @xmath1 pulse and the @xmath0 pulse , and @xmath53 corresponds to the time between the maximum of the @xmath0 pulse and the maximum of the echo .",
    "these times are roughly equal as they should be @xcite .",
    "the duration and amplitude of the @xmath1 pulse are such that it drives the density matrix element @xmath54 of a molecule ( whose transition energy corresponds to @xmath15 ) to @xmath55 .",
    "the @xmath0 pulse completely inverts the molecule .",
    "molecules are excited by a @xmath1 pulse polarizing the sample , which then undergoes dephasing resulting in observed free induction decay .",
    "a @xmath0 pulse is then applied , and the maximum of the photon echo signal is observed at time @xmath56 . using these simulations as a test case we verified our numerical procedure and proceed to the case of interacting molecules .",
    "a schematics of the two pulse @xmath1-@xmath0-echo sequence .",
    "the photon echo signal occurs after application of a pump @xmath1 pulse followed by a probe @xmath0 pulse applied to an ensemble of molecules with inhomogeneous broadening.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the ensemble treated thus far has been a collection of noninteracting molecules . in order to determine the influence of collective effects on the echo amplitude and its form , we employ maxwell - bloch formalism . by solving self - consistently both maxwell s and bloch equations we allow molecules to interact via emission and absorption of em radiation . in the linear regime ( i.e. when the population of molecular excited states is significantly smaller than @xmath30 throughout the entire simulation time ) , the transmission and reflection broaden and flatten as the inhomogeneous broadening is increased .",
    "more importantly , the transmission decreases toward @xmath57 and the reflection increases toward @xmath30 as the density increases beyond @xmath58 m@xmath59 @xcite .",
    "distortion is observed on the edges of the spectral features due to increasing interference between the reflected signals from varying depths of the ensemble . at high molecular concentrations",
    "the reflection becomes quite broad with a plateau near @xmath30 centered at the @xmath15 .",
    "such a behavior is due to the fact that at high densities molecule - molecule interactions result in a redshift of the absorption leading to effective negative electric susceptibility near @xmath15 .",
    "this means that molecules oscillate completely out - of - phase with external field effectively canceling it out , which in turn leads to the high reflection @xcite .",

    "results for the molecular layer of the thickness of @xmath60 nm are shown as circles , triangles correspond to the thickness of @xmath50 nm , and squares correspond to the thickness of @xmath61 nm",
    ". the signal increases with density at lower densities and in several cases drops sharply at higher densities , which is attributed to highly increased reflection .",

    "simulations are performed for several densities , molecular layer thicknesses , and values of inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] . on both sides of the ensemble ,",
    "the echo amplitude increases with the density for lower densities but , in many instances , decreases sharply at higher densities .",
    "this can be understood in terms of how the transmission and reflection of the ensemble vary with density . at higher densities ,",
    "the reflection approaches @xmath30 and the transmission becomes very small as previously discussed .",
    "thus , the driving fields do not make it as far into the ensemble for higher densities making photon echo signal lower as not all molecules contribute to the generation of echo .",
    "another interesting observation is that there is obviously an optimal molecular density , at which the energy of photon echo detected on the output side has a global maximum .",
    "this is explained below .    a snapshot of the molecular population as a function of the position is shown in fig . [ figure4 ] .",
    "the pulse travels from left to right , and the ground state population along the ensemble is calculated immediately after the @xmath1 pulse passes through the ensemble .",
    "it is seen that , for a higher density , the ground state population @xmath67 tends toward @xmath30 as we look farther into the ensemble ; the driving fields are smaller and therefore do not drive the molecules through @xmath1 oscillations . with this in mind , it makes sense that the echo on the output side drops off at higher densities : more and more of the ensemble ( toward the output side ) ceases to participate in the echo at higher densities , and the echo from the input side is not able to travel through the ensemble to the output side .",
    "thus , the echo increases with increasing density until reflection increases significantly , disrupting the echo process throughout the ensemble .",
    "the input side is somewhat more complicated , as there is obvious interference between incoming and outgoing reflected waves , and the reflected waves from lesser depths interfere with reflected waves from deeper regions of the ensemble .",
    "furthermore , the ensemble is driven by high fields on resonance , leading to higher dispersion and as a result the low group velocity .",
    "the latter results in high spatially modulated populations which obviously have a significant effect on the generation of photon echoes @xcite .",
    "ground state population along the 1-d ensemble of molecules calculated for @xmath62 ev at the end of the @xmath1 pulse .",
    "the ensemble is @xmath50 nm in length .",
    "density is : ( a ) @xmath68 m@xmath59 , ( b ) @xmath58 m@xmath59,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we now turn our attention to a exciton - plasmon system comprised of a periodic array of slits and molecules with inhomogeneous broadening as schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure1]b .",
    "the bare metallic grating exhibits a set of surface plasmon resonances in the form of enhanced transmission and decreased reflection . for the parameters used we consider the plasmon resonance near @xmath69 ev as our working mode .",
    "we note that the em field distribution corresponding to this mode is highly localized near slits on both input and output sides of the array .",
    "adding resonant molecules ( whose transition energy is @xmath69 ev ) with no inhomogeneous broadening and probing in the linear regime results in rabi splitting of the corresponding plasmon mode into an upper and lower polariton .",
    "however when the molecules exhibit inhomogeneous broadening , the rabi splitting is still present but it is significantly broader as one may expect as not all molecules are as strongly coupled compared to the previous case .",
    "nonetheless anticipated broader spectrum one can actually observe significantly higher rabi splitting .",
    "[ figure5 ] shows transmission spectra for bare slits , the hybrid system with no inhomogeneous broadening , and for the hybrid system whose molecules are inhomogeneously broadened . as seen from fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] , the rabi splitting for the hybrid system with no inhomogeneous broadening reaches @xmath70 mev whereas that for a hybrid system with inhomogeneous broadening is @xmath71 mev .",
    "this is a surprising result .",
    "one would have expected to observe the opposite behavior of the rabi splitting . however",
    "the increase of the splitting in systems with distributed energies is not uncommon .",
    "simulations of optics of exciton - plasmon systems comprised diatomic molecules ( described using the full machinery of a ro - vibrational structure ) and metal reveal similar tendency .",
    "the increase of the exciton - plasmon coupling is observed for the molecules described by two potential energy surfaces with the excited one being a dissociative state , i.e. having a continuum of ro - vibrational states @xcite .",
    "this in part can be explained by the fact that plasmon resonances are usually quite broad and nearly all molecular transition energies @xmath72 contribute coherently to the coupling .     linear transmission through periodic array of slits .",
    "slit period is 320 nm , film thickness is @xmath60 nm , slit width is @xmath73 nm , the molecular layer has a thickness of @xmath74 nm , molecular density is @xmath58 m@xmath59 .",

    "what is seen is very different from the echo generated by the 1-d ensemble : for this system , an echo with a clear double - peaked structure is observed .",
    "the fourier analysis of the echo signal reveals two peaks as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] .",
    "we proceed to show that this double - peaked structure has its origin in the interaction between the surface plasmons and the molecules .",
    "echo signal observed for the exciton - plasmon nanosystem comprising periodic array of slits and molecules .",
    "double - peaked photon echo is recorded by calculating the transverse component of electric field , @xmath76 , as a function of time as shown in the upper row .",
    "the corresponding spectra of echo signals are shown in lower row .",
    "the molecular density is @xmath58 m@xmath59 , the thickness of the molecular film is @xmath74 nm , fwhm of the molecular transition energy distribution is 2.06 ev .",
    "a nondispersive spacer of varying thickness is inserted between the film and the slits , and the double - peaked structure gradually reduces to a single peak as the spacer thickness is increased .",
    "the spacer lengths ( from left to right ) are @xmath57 nm , @xmath77 nm , @xmath78 nm , and @xmath79 nm.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    surface plasmons are intense and localized to within nanometers of the metallic structure . in order to ascertain whether our observations of the double - peak echo is influenced by surface plasmons ,",
    "we insert a ( vacuum ) spacer layer of variable thickness between the molecular film and the slits . as the spacer thickness",
    "is increased , the film is moved into progressively weaker plasmon fields leading to a noticeably lower molecule - plasmon coupling . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] , the double - peaked structure of the echo gradually disappears as the spacer thickness is increased .",
    "the amount of coupling between plasmons and molecules depends , among other things , on the strength of the plasmon fields .",
    "we therefore expect that if the double - peaked structure of the echo is caused by strong coupling between plasmons and molecules , a spacer layer of increasing size will reduce the echo to a single peak , which is exactly what we observe .",
    "it is however surprising to see how sensitive the double - peak structure is to molecule - plasmon coupling .    to further confirm that the double peak structure is the signature of the upper and lower polaritons that are formed as a result of strong coupling between surface plasmons and molecules we tweak the coupling by introducing a spacer between molecules and the array of slits .",
    "an fast fourier transform ( fft ) of each echo signal in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] indicates two clearly - defined peaks for smaller spacer thickness , and these two peaks reduce to one single peak as the spacer thickness increases .",
    "even though plasmon fields are still quite significant at distances of @xmath78 nm above the metal the spectrum of echo is already reduced to a single resonance at @xmath15 .",
    "these two peaks likely correspond to the upper and lower polariton energies .",
    "however , a precise correspondence between the upper and lower polariton energies and the two peaks in the echo spectra was difficult to obtain for several purely technical reasons . first , the energies of the peaks in the fft of the echo signal were very sensitive to the sampling range , which in turn is affected by the residuals of @xmath0-pulse in the signal .",
    "as the range was changed , the double - peak structure remained roughly the same but the energies of the peaks shifted .",
    "secondly , we sought a relation between the upper and lower polariton amplitudes in the linear spectrum versus the height of the fft peaks , but a larger peak in the linear spectrum does not necessarily correspond to a stronger peak in the fft spectrum as the echo depends on rephasing , and the upper and lower polariton energies may be asymmetrically detuned from the central energy , leading to a weaker rephasing of one component or the other .",
    "finally , spatial inhomogeneities of the fields also complicate the matter in that some molecules may be driven through more or less than the `` correct '' @xmath1 - @xmath0 sequence . if , however , the double - peak echoes are unique to exciton - plasmon systems we should be able to observe similar signals in other systems such as a core - shell nanoparticle , for instance , as depicted in fig . [ figure1]c .",
    "photon echo observed in core - shell nanoparticles .",
    "the core is silver with a radius of @xmath78 nm and the shell with a thickness of @xmath74 nm consists of interacting molecules with inhomogeneous broadening ( @xmath17 = 0.236 ev ) . in order to illustrate the plasmonic origin of the double - peaked echo structure ,",
    "the central energy of the two - level molecular distribution is detuned from the plasmon resonance of @xmath80 ev .",
    "the central energy @xmath15 is a ) @xmath81 ev , b ) @xmath82 ev , c ) @xmath83 ev , and d ) @xmath84 ev .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    proceeding with the idea that the double peak is caused by surface plasmons , we consider a different hybrid system consisting of a metallic cylinder surrounded by a shell of two - level molecules with inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "the bare silver core shows a plasmon resonance at @xmath80 ev ; the transmission is enhanced and the reflection is reduced . to minimize the interaction between the molecules and the localized surface plasmon",
    ", the central energy of the distribution of molecules is detuned by varying @xmath15 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] , this results in the gradual loss of the double - peak structure in the echo .",
    "detuning was also applied to the hybrid slits system , both by adjusting the molecules central energy as well as adjusting the slit period ( and therefore altering the surface plasmon energy ) . as expected , the double - peak structure disappeared in each instance as detuning was increased .",
    "we performed rigorous numerical studies of photon echo using maxwell - bloch formalism .",
    "it is shown that photon echoes are highly dependent on materials parameters such as a thickness of molecular layer and molecular density .",
    "we have demonstrated that our numerical methods reproduce photon echoes and we have characterized the echo from a one - dimensional ensemble in terms of density , ensemble length , and amount of inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "it is demonstrated that in one - dimensional systems the echo detected on the output side has an optimal molecular concentration at which the transmitted signal has a maximum energy . to the best of our knowledge",
    "it is shown for the first time that applying two - pulse photon echo sequence to exciton - plasmon systems leads to double - peaked echoes .",
    "this is demonstrated by various different means to be of plasmonic origin , with the double - peaked structure resulting from the hybrid modes of the system .",
    "it is also shown that the unique signature of upper and lower polaritons in echo is highly sensitive to exciton - plasmon coupling making it a great tool for ultrafast probes of nanomaterials .",
