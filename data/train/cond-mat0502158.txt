    "we will focus on the phenomena observed in nickelates and manganites , which can be attributed to strongly correlated @xmath0 electrons .",
    "so far , it is known that in the regime of large intraorbital coulomb interaction @xmath3 strong quantum fluctuations may lead to qualitatively new behavior in a mott insulator with three @xmath0 electrons per site @xcite , but the competition between various magnetic and orbital instabilities was little explored in the weak coupling regime .    while several features are generic in the models with two @xcite or more @xcite orbitals per ion , and occur already when diagonal hopping is assumed , we note that these models are closer to the behavior of @xmath4 electrons",
    " strong interactions between them might explain a ferromagnetic ( fm ) instability in ruthenates @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the orbital flavor for @xmath0 electrons is not conserved , and this is likely to lead to partial orbital polarization which is expected to modify the magnetic instabilities . here",
    "we will consider such a realistic two - dimensional ( 2d ) model of @xmath0 electrons with @xmath5 hopping element @xmath6 at intermediate and strong coupling , which includes the full structure of on - site coulomb interactions with two parameters : the hubbard element @xmath3 and hund s exchange @xmath1 @xcite , and the crystal field orbital splitting @xmath2 .",
    "the magnetic and orbital instabilities within the @xmath0 band were less investigated until now , but they become very relevant in the context of doped la@xmath7sr@xmath8nio@xmath9 nickelates , where interesting novel phases including the stripe order were discovered @xcite . they were obtained in the theory using realistic models both in hartree - fock @xcite and in exact diagonalization of finite clusters including the coupling to the lattice @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the role of hund s exchange in the fm instability and in the metal - insulator transition was emphasized using a multiband gutzwiller wave - function @xcite .",
    "all these studies reveal interesting competition between fm and antiferromagnetic ( af ) instabilities at density @xmath10 , and the competition between the latter two and a @xmath11-af instability at @xmath12 . in this paper",
    "we investigate the pure electronic problem for @xmath0 electrons , using the mean - field approximation , seeking for phases which are both orbitally and magnetically polarized . by varying the electron density @xmath13 between half filling @xmath14 and @xmath15 ,",
    "we cover the hole doping regime @xmath16 relevant to the nickelates .",

    "[ fig : fm ] , several fm phases occur .",
    "consider first the intermediate interaction strength @xmath67 [ figs .",
    "[ fig : fm](a - c ) ] , where one finds two disconnected fm states : one for @xmath73 , and the second one for @xmath74 .",
    "the latter corresponds to a van hove singularity in the density of states .",
    "since it is predominantly related to the @xmath25 orbital , both the orbital polarization @xmath52 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fm](b ) ] and the magnetic polarization @xmath53 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fm](c ) ] are positive in this doping regime .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath73 the total energy is minimized when a higher electron density is found in the @xmath44 orbital , where also larger magnetic moments are formed .",
    "such anisotropic filling of @xmath0 orbitals follows from a large difference between the @xmath46 and @xmath75 hopping elements @xcite .",
    "note that the orbital polarization is here opposite to that in the reference pm state .",
    "the above peculiar behavior disappears gradually when the interaction strength is enhanced to @xmath68 and both @xmath52 and @xmath53 tend to saturate to the optimal value , being positive ( negative ) for @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) , leaving the @xmath44 orbital almost fully polarized . here",
    "the magnetic instability , with the largest effective interaction term @xmath78 , dominates and the magnetization barely deviates from its saturation value @xmath79 , except for the low electron density @xmath80 . in this case",
    "doping the half - filled fm state first leads to holes introduced into the @xmath25 orbitals , leaving the center of the narrower band , with predominantly @xmath44 orbital character , below the former broader one .",
    "therefore , in this situation the formation of localized magnetic moments optimizes the energy .",
    "they are naturally associated with the @xmath44 orbitals since they contribute to the narrower band .",
    "when hund s exchange coupling @xmath1 is reduced , the interaction in the @xmath72-channel becomes _ attractive_. as a result , for large @xmath68 , both @xmath52 and @xmath53 nearly saturate to the ideal behaviors @xmath81 for @xmath76 and @xmath79 for @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , a transition between these two solutions would be first order , and one observes a jump at @xmath61 .",
    "however , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fm](d - f ) , the two - sublattice orbital order sets in in this crossover regime in the form of a fm@xmath82 state .",

    "indeed , at @xmath89 one finds appreciable orbital polarization , with @xmath25 orbitals occupied and almost empty @xmath44 orbitals , the situation encountered in la@xmath90sr@xmath91mno@xmath9 manganites @xcite . in all fm phases found at @xmath56 the total magnetization is close to saturation .",
    "when @xmath3 is reduced , one gradually recovers the behavior obtained for large @xmath92 .",

    "the order parameters are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : af ] for the same parameter values as for the fm case . for @xmath68 and @xmath71",
    "the mean - field equations possess two competing solutions [ figs .",
    "[ fig : af](a - c ) ] .",
    "the first one , which can be continued to weak coupling , is characterized by negative values of orbital @xmath52 and magnetic @xmath53 polarizations .",
    "namely , the higher electron density is found within the @xmath44 orbitals , and these orbitals carry the magnetic moment .",
    "more precisely , introducing holes in the half - filled insulating af state mostly affects the band with @xmath25 orbital character , leaving the localized magnetic moments within the @xmath44 orbital almost saturated .",
    "this solution extends to large doping @xmath93 .",
    "in contrast , the second solution rather stems from the behavior expected for low density : the electrons first occupy the broader band with @xmath25 orbital character until quarter filling ( @xmath94 ) is reached , and next they gradually occupy the other band , with @xmath44 orbital character .",
    "however , since the interaction in the @xmath72-channel is _ repulsive _ and since both bands are coupled , the orbital polarization @xmath52 and the magnetic polarization @xmath53 are reduced from their maximal values which would be reached for decoupled orbitals .",
    "these two trends from @xmath65 and @xmath95 contradict each other , and therefore an abrupt ( first order ) transition between both solutions is observed at @xmath96 [ figs .",
    "[ fig : af](b - c ) ] .",
    "reducing @xmath1 barely affects the above findings for strong coupling @xmath68 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : af](d - f ) ] .",
    "while the magnetization @xmath70 is almost unchanged , the first order transition between two differently polarized states is more pronounced , as the values of the orbital polarization and the magnetic polarization are enhanced .",
    "when reducing @xmath3 the location of the first order phase transition shifts towards smaller doping , while all order parameters are suppressed . at the same time the critical doping locating the second order phase transition is reduced by a weaker coulomb interaction @xmath3 but is enhanced by a weaker hund s exchange coupling @xmath1 . when seeking for other phases one may expect that two - sublattice fm solutions can smoothly interpolate between the fm and af states .",
    "such solutions never turned out to be the ground state in this study ( up to @xmath68 ) .",
    "but for the @xmath11-af phase .",
    "]    a competition between the fm and af order in the present model of @xmath0 band may lead to a superposition of the two phases in a form of @xmath11-af phase , where the magnetic moments are fm along one direction and staggered in the other ( orthogonal ) one . according to recent numerical simulations @xcite , a coexistence of fm and af bonds is indeed expected for @xmath97 . unlike in the af phase , the order parameters are continuous functions of doping for @xmath71 , as can be seen in figs .  [",
    "fig : caf](a - c ) .",
    "this behavior is similar to that of the fm case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fm ] ) . its origin can be attributed to the orbital polarization which is substantially stronger in the af case to the extent that is exceeds a certain threshold above which no smooth solution can interpolate between the small and large doping regimes . for @xmath98 the magnetic moment @xmath70",
    "is carried by the @xmath44 orbital for large @xmath3 , while @xmath70 decreases and @xmath52 changes sign for small @xmath3 .",
    "when reducing @xmath92 , the orbital polarization is enhanced and a first order transition appears for @xmath68 [ see figs .  [",
    "fig : caf](d - f ) ] . in this case both the orbital polarization and the magnetic moment are predominantly carried by the stronger correlated @xmath44 orbital ( with a weaker hopping and thus larger ratio @xmath99 than @xmath100 ) in the physically relevant doping range centered around @xmath101 .",
    "our main findings are summarized in the phase diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : dm ] . for @xmath71 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dm](a ) ] , the doped pm phase is characterized by a positive orbital polarization , therefore denoted pm@xmath54 .",
    "it is unstable towards af@xmath54 phase for small doping up to @xmath97 , towards @xmath11-af@xmath54 phase for @xmath102 and for @xmath103 , and towards fm@xmath54 phase otherwise . in particular , for @xmath94",
    "the fm@xmath54 , @xmath11-af@xmath54 , orbitally unpolarized fm and ( for @xmath104 ) the alternating fm@xmath105 phases appear successively with increasing interaction strength @xmath106 .",
    "the @xmath11-af phases are found for @xmath97 at @xmath107 , and also in a small range around @xmath108 .    when reducing @xmath92 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dm ] ( b ) ] , the main difference appears for @xmath61 . here",
    "the pm@xmath54 phase is unstable towards an af@xmath54 phase which itself is robust and remains stable up to strong coupling .",
    "this seemingly peculiar behavior can be better understood by diagonalizing exactly a two - site cluster .",
    "one can find the ground state to be af@xmath54 for small @xmath1 and arbitrary @xmath3 and fm@xmath105 for large @xmath92 , in qualitative agreement with our mean - field calculation .",
    "let us finally mention that the model we use is known to have a van hove singularity in the vicinity of @xmath109 , which is expected to induce a fm instability for arbitrary weak coupling at zero temperature .",
    "this particular instability , however , turns out to be unusually strongly temperature dependent .",
    "therefore , the corresponding critical value of the stoner parameter @xmath106 is finite at temperature @xmath110 , and reaches a value close to @xmath111 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dm ] ) at @xmath112 used in this work .",
    "orbital model ( [ eq : h ] ) as functions of the stoner parameter @xmath78 and hole doping @xmath113 , with : ( a ) @xmath55 , and ( b ) @xmath56 .",
    "panel ( c ) shows the stable phases for finite crystal field splitting @xmath114 and @xmath55 .",
    "transitions from the pm phase to magnetic phases are second order .",
    "the remaining solid lines denote first order transitions while the dashed , dotted , and dashed - dotted lines indicate second order transitions . ]      a complete investigation of the phase diagrams at finite crystal field splitting @xmath2 would be quite involved , and is left for future work . at @xmath62 the majority of stable magnetic solutions is characterized by a positive orbital polarization , a tendency expected for a 2d model of @xmath0 electrons @xcite , which would certainly be enhanced by a negative crystal field @xmath2 .",
    "we therefore limit our present discussion to the influence of a positive @xmath2 , in order to investigate a competition between the kinetic energy , which is lower when the broad band with predominantly @xmath25 orbital character is closer to half filling , and the potential energy at finite @xmath2 . furthermore , we restrict ourselves to the strong hund s exchange coupling regime @xmath55 .    as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : dm](c ) , the orbital polarization of the pm phase is changed to negative ( pm@xmath115 phase ) already for moderate @xmath114 . as a result , the magnetic moment and the orbital polarization are carried by the same orbital in all phases , and the magnetic instabilities are achieved for lower values of @xmath116 .",
    "another consequence of finite @xmath117 is the observed shift of the van hove singularity to larger doping , strongly enhancing the tendency towards ferromagnetism in the low density regime .",
    "in addition , the competition between fm and af phases at quarter filling ( @xmath94 ) remains quite spectacular : even though both weak coupling and strong coupling expansions predict antiferromagnetism , as does our calculation , fm phase nevertheless takes over in an intermediate coupling regime @xmath118 .",
    "such features as the af@xmath115 phase obtained for low doping , the @xmath11-af@xmath115 phase for @xmath98 , and fm one for both @xmath119 and @xmath120 , are robust and are found also at finite crystal field , in particular in the strong coupling regime . on the contrary , the instability of the pm phase to the fm@xmath54 phase disappears , and the one to the @xmath11-af phase moves from @xmath121 to small doping .",
    "in summary , we have determined the phase diagram of @xmath0 electrons on the square lattice within the mean - field approximation .",
    "the occurrence of antiferromagnetism in the vicinity of half filling , followed by @xmath11-af phase at @xmath97 , as well as fm phases for @xmath122 and @xmath74 , are robust features of this model .",
    "note that the regions of stability of the af and @xmath11-af phases with respect to the fm one would still be somewhat extended due to quantum corrections @xcite .",
    "in particular , the occurrence of @xmath11-af phase indicates that even more complex types of magnetic phases , such as stripe phases with larger magnetic unit cells @xcite , might be expected in doped nickelates .",
    "in contrast , the ground state is strongly parameter dependent in the vicinity of quarter filling , @xmath94 , resembling to some extent the ground state of the model with two equivalent orbitals @xcite .",
    "while the orbital polarization systematically appears in all phases , the orbital carrying the magnetic moment does not necessarily coincide with the one carrying higher electron density , leading to a particularly interesting interplay between magnetic and orbital degrees of freedom .",
