    "recently , two of us derived a new effective field theory@xcite for transverse spin fluctuations in ordered quantum antiferromagnets .",
    "our approach is based on the holstein - primakoff transformation,@xcite which maps the original spin hamiltonian onto a bosonic many - body hamiltonian .",
    "however , rather than working directly with the canonical holstein - primakoff bosons , we express them in terms of hermitian field operators representing staggered and uniform transverse spin fluctuations .",
    "@xcite the main advantages of this procedure are : ( a ) the suppression of the effective interaction between antiferromagnetic magnons at long wavelengths is manifest ; ( b ) the relation between holstein - primakoff bosons and the fields of the nonlinear sigma model@xcite ( nlsm ) representing the transverse staggered spin fluctuation is made precise ; ( c ) the zero wave vector modes of the uniform and staggered magnetization can be easily treated within this approach,@xcite which is important in the study of finite magnets ; ( d ) the transverse ferromagnetic fluctuations may be eliminated to yield an effective theory involving only transverse antiferromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "this is most easily done within a path integral approach ; the resulting effective action coincides with the nlsm at the gaussian level .",
    "although the interaction terms of the effective action differ from those of the nlsm , the renormalization group flows of both theories agree to one - loop order.@xcite    here , we extend the hermitian operator approach to antiferromagnets in a uniform magnetic field . in this case , the differences between this approach and the nlsm become more substantial . already at the gaussian level",
    "the two theories differ : while the hermitian operator approach reproduces by construction the correct spin - wave dispersion known from spin - wave theory , the nlsm does not .",
    "more severely , we show below that a quartic interaction term present in the hermitian operator approach is absent in the nlsm .",
    "we shall constrain the analysis here to a heisenberg model on a hypercubic lattice with nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath1 .",
    "it is however straightforward to extend the results to general bipartite lattices .",
    "this would also cover a recently synthesized metal - organic @xmath2 quantum antiferromagnet on a distorted honeycomb lattice,@xcite which is bipartite . in presence of a uniform external field @xmath3 ( measured in units of energy ) , the hamiltonian is given by @xmath4 here , @xmath5 are spin operators normalized such that @xmath6 , and the first sum is over nearest neighbor pairs @xmath7 of a hypercubic lattice with lattice constant @xmath8 .",
