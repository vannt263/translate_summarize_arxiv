    "di - boson production processes are important channels to test the standard model  ( sm ) at the lhc .",
    "they have been studied intensively in the past years both from the theoretical and the experimental side . as a signal , they are sensitive to triple gauge boson couplings , and therefore , provide a unique avenue to quantify deviations from the sm predictions .",
    "furthermore , they are a background to many sm and beyond standard model analyses . due to the large size of the next - to - leading order(nlo ) corrections and the expected percent precision measurement at the lhc ,",
    "the theoretical community has pursued in the last years the task to provide next - to - next - to - leading order  ( nnlo ) qcd results .",
    "this task has been almost completed in the last years and exact results at nnlo are known for most of the processes , not only for total cross sections  @xcite , but also for differential distributions  @xcite . at the same time , due to the large collection of results known at nlo for processes with different jet multiplicities , a field by its own has emerged with the aim to merge in a consistent way processes with different jet multiplicities at nlo . in this letter , following the loopsim approach  @xcite , we will merge @xmath1 and @xmath1+jet samples and review results at approximate nnlo accuracy for several di - boson production processes .",
    "furthermore , we will show preliminary results of anomalous couplings effects in @xmath0 production .",
    "using the loopsim approach , we merge samples at nlo accuracy , provided by the vbfnlo monte carlo program  @xcite , for several @xmath1 and @xmath1+jet production processes .",
    "the merged sample is simultaneously accurate at nlo for both the @xmath1 and @xmath1+jet sample and provides results at nnlo accuracy for the @xmath1 production process in certain regions of the phase space since it includes consistently the double - real and virtual - real contributions to the @xmath1 nnlo contributions , simulating in a unitarity approach , the missing two loop corrections , such that by construction the merged sample is infrared finite .",
    "thus the sample consistently includes all the new phase space regions opening up first at nnlo , including the double soft and collinear emission of the weak bosons , which leads to numerically large logarithms of the form @xmath2 and therefore to potentially large nnlo corrections .",
    "furthermore , it includes consistently the new partonic sub - processes opening up at nnlo , in this case , @xmath3 and @xmath4 initiated processes . thus in regions of phase space where the lo kinematics are not dominant and therefore the missing finite piece of the two loop corrections is suppressed , like in inclusive anomalous coupling searches , the merged sample should provide most of the nnlo contributions .    ,",
