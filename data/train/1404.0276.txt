    "astrophysicists have enough evidence that our universe is expanding with positive acceleration , instead of deceleration , as it should be in a world filled only with ordinary matter ruled by usual laws of gravity .",
    "the reality of this fact is beyond doubt , although its interpretation is far from having a single meaning ( see , for example , books and review articles @xcite devoted to this problem ) .",
    "one of the most developed interpretations in the terms of theoretical modeling , comparing of numerical predictions with observational data , and determination of the parameters and their confidence intervals is a scalar field that fills the universe almost homogeneously and slowly rolls down to the minimum of its own potential in the case of a quintessential scalar field or slowly rolls up to the maximum in the case of a phantom one .",
    "there are many possible realizations of such a field ( one can find a large portion of references in the sources mentioned above ) , which is why the additional observational or experimental tests , which could help to constrain the number of candidates at least in the class of scalar field models of dark energy , are needed .",
    "it seems that observational cosmological data obtained in the last few years @xcite prefer phantom dark energy @xcite .",
    "however , we are still far from establishing the physical nature of dark energy , and it is necessary to search for new sensitive tests for it .    the properties of dark energy are extensively investigated in the frw space - time as the cosmological background and a lot of models have been proposed .",
    "the physical parameters of dynamical dark energy ( energy density , potential etc . ) are time dependent in such a space - time . and contrarily , the properties of dynamical dark energy in the static world of gravitationally bound systems are unknown .",
    "we try to remove this lack by analysis of dynamical properties of the scalar field as the dark energy of either quintessential or phantom type in the galaxies and vicinity of stars and black holes .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the distribution of the density of quintessential and phantom dark energy in the weak and strong gravitational fields of the static astrophysical objects . in this regard",
    "we are interested refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors of which drew the conclusion about decreasing the mass of a black hole onto which the phantom dark energy falls . to verify this conclusion",
    ", we analyze the evolution of density perturbations of dark energy in the weak and strong gravitational fields , the possibility of static configurations of the fields in neighborhood of massive astrophysical objects , and the accretion of the dark energy onto them .",
    "we prove the illusiveness of decreasing the black hole mass caused by accretion of the phantom dark energy .",
    "the numerous studies of the evolution of dark energy perturbations in the expanding universe , summarized in many reviews and books ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , support that - 1 ) dynamical dark energy with equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) is perturbed due to its own gravitational instability and perturbations of other components - and 2 ) the amplitudes of density perturbations of dark energy depend on effective sound speed and in most of the viable models are much less than the amplitudes of the density perturbations of matter . in the paper",
    "@xcite we have analyzed the behavior of density and velocity perturbations of dark energy in a static world with the minkowski metric and have shown that density and velocity perturbations of dark energy are extremely small in comparison to the dark matter perturbations on all scales interesting for astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "that is , in the weak gravitational fields the amplitudes of perturbations of dark energy are small and equations for their evolution can be linearized with respect to the perturbed quantities of dark energy . in the galaxy or cluster of galaxies region , where the gravitational field caused by inhomogeneities of matter is weak ,",
    "the space - time metric can be represented as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the gravitational potential caused by density inhomogeneities of matter and dark energy ( we consider only the scalar mode of perturbations ) . here and below",

    "it means that for dark energy models with @xmath21 another important relation @xmath22 is valid at all scales interesting for astrophysics .",
    "the oscillation modes of the solutions ( [ delta_de ] ) , ( [ v_de ] ) reflect the gravitational stability of dark energy beyond the matter inhomogeneity , the gravitational field of which plays the role of driving force in the equations of evolution of dark energy perturbations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .    for analysis of the behavior of dark energy in the weak gravitational fields ,",
    "let us neglect the oscillatory component accepting @xmath23 and analyze only the `` forced '' component of the solutions .",
    "it is determined by the magnitude of the gravitational potential , by its time dependence and also by the parameters of dark energy , eos parameter @xmath24 , and effective sound speed @xmath8 . for positive perturbations of matter , overdensities of continuous media or separate objects we have always @xmath25 .",
    "the amplitude of forced density perturbations of quintessential dark energy ( @xmath26 ) has positive sign , and for the phantom one ( @xmath27 ) , it has negative sign .",
    "the amplitude of velocities of both types of dark energy in the region of matter overdensities has a negative sign , this means that dark energy flows into a region of matter perturbation , the amplitude of which grows . in other words , during inflow ( accretion ) of phantom dark energy its density decreases .",
    "the physical nature of such decreasing is the same as in the case of the increasing of density of phantom dark energy in the expanding universe .",
    "although the amplitudes of matter overdensities in the static world of galaxies increase exponentially with time ( see solutions ( 16)-(18 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath28 the inflow of phantom dark energy according to ( [ delta_de ] ) and ( [ v_de ] ) forms the dark energy underdense ( @xmath29 ) region , while the inflow of quintessential dark energy forms the overdense ( @xmath30 ) one . going beyond the linear approach ( see the next sections )",
    "does not change the character of evolution : when inhomogeneities of dark and baryon matter collapse , the density of phantom dark energy continues to decrease in them .",
    "let us consider now the dynamics of dark energy in the gravitational field of nonrotating spherical static objects .",
    "the space - time metric in spherically symmetric coordinates in the general case can be presented as follows : @xmath31 we assume that metric is completely defined by the spherical static body with radius @xmath32 and constant density @xmath33 and pressure @xmath34 . in such a case the components of the metric do not depend on time and are determined by einstein equations with boundary conditions @xmath35 ( see , for example , ref .",

    "thus , the metric of 4-space in the neighborhood of the nonrotating spherical static object ( @xmath42 ) is the schwarzschild metric : @xmath46 for most stars and galaxies @xmath47 , so we can neglect the component @xmath48 in ( [ gcomps:2 ] ) and obtain the simple space - time metric inside the homogeneous object ( @xmath39 ) , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is constant for given spherical static object .",
    "the space - time metric ( [ s2:shvartshild ] ) , ( [ s2:shvartshild_in ] ) is regular , not singular , in all space - time for objects with @xmath51 . obviously , the top - hat density profile is a very rough approximation for real astrophysical static objects , but it is sufficient for evaluation of the dark energy amount in stars and their vicinities .    henceforth , we will assume that the space - time metric ( [ s2:shvartshild ] ) , ( [ s2:shvartshild_in ] ) is not affected by the presence of dark energy .",
    "the estimations of dark energy density in galaxies and clusters of galaxies given above provide grounds for such an assumption .",
