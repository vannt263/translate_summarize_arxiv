    "the purpose of this work is to describe the backbone chain of a protein molecule in terms of dynamically independent variables , which are the torsional angles between successive units of the chain .",
    "these angles determined the average conformation of the chain , and local vibrations of chemical bonds only contribute to small fluctuations about the average . by ignoring these fluctuations",
    ", we gain a better overview of the motion of the chain , in particular its folding .",
    "we use the torsional angles as generalized coordinates in the canonical formalism , with concomitant canonical momenta .",
    "the kinetic energy then becomes a function of the coordinates , when expressed in term of the canonical momenta .",
    "that is , masses are replaced by a generalized mass matrix , which is a function of the coordinates .",
    "there arises an effective potential , which is discussed in detailed later . by studying this mass matrix numerically , we find that the effective potential is approximately constant for almost all conformations of the chain .",
    "this result is significant for practical applications , particularly for the csaw ( conditioned self - avoiding walk ) model @xcite , where such an approach was first used .    using the canonical formalism",
    ", we formulate the eigenvalue problem that describes the normal modes of the system with respect to an equilibrium conformation .",
    "actual computations are carried out for a pure @xmath0-helix and a pure @xmath1-sheet , to obtain distribution functions of the normal frequencies .",
    "these pure structures are hypothetical , of course , for in a real situation they are embedded inside a larger protein . however , we can learn something useful from these examples .",
    "first of all , in our model we assume that the @xmath0-helix and the @xmath1-sheet are stabilized purely through hydrogen bonding .",
    "the positive - definiteness of normal frequencies indicates that these structures can maintain mechanical stability from hydrogen bonding .",
    "this leads one to expect that in the unfolded protein chain , which is subject to random forces from the solution , these secondary structures may still have transient existence .",
    "the normal - frequency distribution function for the @xmath0-helix exhibits a number of peaks . by examining the corresponding eigenvectors , we can associate them with types of distortion , namely stretching , twisting and bending . by superposing the distributions of several @xmath0-helices , we can construct an approximate normal - frequency distribution of an all-@xmath0 protein , such as myoglobin .",
    "we can obtain the free energy of a structure near equilibrium by treating the system as a collection of harmonic oscillators with the calculated normal frequencies .",
    "as such an exercise , we compute the free energy of a pure @xmath0-helix and that of a pure @xmath2-sheet , and plot the results as functions of temperature . we find that the two curves intersect , indicating a phase transition occurring at that temperature .",
    "such a model is of course too crude to have quantitative significance , for real secondary structures are embedded in a larger protein , and interactions not taken into account here may be important .",
    "however , in view of the importance of the subject , in particular its possible relevance to the prion transition prusiner , any exploratory calculation in this direction might not be totally meaningless .",
    "the protein chain consists of a sequence of amino acids chosen from a pool of 20 .",
    "these amino acids all center about a carbon atom called the c@xmath3 , and differ from one another only in the side chains connected to the c@xmath4 . when the amino acids are joined into a chain , they become interlocked  residues \" . from a dynamical point of view , the independent units of the chain are  cranks \" made up of coplanar chemical bonds , which connect one c@xmath4 to the next , as shown in fig .

    "the results are listed in table [ alphavibmotion ] .    as an application of our results",
    ", we calculate the normal - mode distribution for myoglobin ( 1mbd ) @xcite , which is made up of 8 alpha - helices , by superposing our calculated distributions .",
    "this procedure ignores the interactions between helices , and contributions from the loops connecting the helices , and can only give the crudest approximation to the actual distribution .",
    "the result is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "the lower panel shows a histogram obtained previously by krimm and reisdorf @xcite , using a different method .",
    "there is qualitative agreement , but the peaks are shifted , presumably due to interactions neglected in our simple superposition .",
