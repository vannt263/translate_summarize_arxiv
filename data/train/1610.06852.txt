    "starting with the pioneering work of volterra @xcite , much attention has been drawn on dislocations in solids , as the ultimate cause of plasticity in crystalline materials @xcite .",
    "observed experimentally for the first time in 1956 @xcite , dislocations are line defects in the lattice structure .",
    "the interest in dislocations became more and more evident as soon as it was understood that their presence can significantly influence the chemical and physical properties of the material .",
    "the measure of the severity of the lattice mismatch due to a dislocation is encoded in the _ burgers vector _ , whose magnitude is a multiple of the lattice spacing . according to whether the burgers vector is perpendicular or parallel to the dislocation line",
    ", ideal dislocations are classified as _ edge dislocations _ or _ screw dislocations _ , respectively . in nature , real dislocations come as a combination of these two types . for general treaties on dislocations ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus our attention on screw dislocations in a single isotropic crystal which occupies a cylindrical region @xmath2 and which undergoes antiplane shear .",
    "we also assume that the burgers vector of a dislocation is equal to one lattice spacing and that all the burgers vectors are oriented in the same direction . according to the model proposed in @xcite ,",
    "these assumptions allow us to study the problem in the cross section @xmath3 . throughout the work",
    ", we will always assume that @xmath4 moreover , without loss of generality , we consider the lattice spacing of @xmath5 to be @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , any dislocation line is directed along the axis of the cylinder , it is characterized by a burgers vector of magnitude a multiple of @xmath7 along the same axis , and meets the cross section @xmath5 at a single point .",
    "we also assume that an _ external strain _",
    "acts on the crystal : we prescribe the tangential strain on @xmath8 to be a function @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the one - dimensional hausdorff measure . since in a crystal",
    "the minimum lattice mismatch is of the order of one lattice spacing ( see @xcite ) , this choice of the external strain will determine at most one dislocation inside @xmath5 , which we denote by @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the strain of the deformed crystal is represented by a field @xmath12 , solution to the following system : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the dirac delta centered at @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the tangent unit vector to @xmath8 .",
    "the divergence condition in is an equilibrium condition in the framework of linearized elasticity .",
    "the condition on the @xmath17 encodes the presence of the dislocation inside the crystal , thus forbidding @xmath18 to be a gradient globally in @xmath5 ; however , this is true locally in @xmath19 .",
    "both these conditions are intended in the sense of distributions in @xmath20 .",
    "the boundary condition @xmath21 on @xmath22 must be intended in the sense of traces ( see @xcite ) , and , as we will prove in corollary [ confino ] , serves the purpose of confining the dislocation inside the domain .",
    "notice also that the circulation of @xmath18 along any simple closed curve @xmath23 enclosing the dislocation point @xmath15 is equal to @xmath7 : thus , the constant @xmath7 in front of the delta in can be interpreted as a compatibility condition with .    in principle , the position occupied by the dislocation @xmath11 , at the equilibrium , is the one for which the dirichlet energy @xmath24 is minimal , and will be influenced by the particular external strain acting on the crystal .",
    "our aim is to study how the dirichlet energy varies as @xmath11 varies in @xmath5 . yet , as it is easy to see , the field @xmath18 in has infinite dirichlet energy .",
    "more precisely , given @xmath25 , denoting by @xmath26 the disk of radius @xmath27 centered at @xmath11 and by @xmath28 its closure , we have @xmath29 notice that the rate of divergence of the dirichlet energy to @xmath30 in is independent of @xmath15 .",
    "this suggests to study the energy far from the dislocation : we consider the problem in @xmath31 , that is , neglecting the dirichlet energy in the _ core _ @xmath26 .",
    "this strategy , called _ core radius approach _ , is well known and it is employed in different contexts such as linear elasticity ( see , for instance , @xcite ; also @xcite for screw dislocations and @xcite for edge dislocations ) , the theory of ginzburg - landau vortices ( see , for instance , @xcite and the refereces therein ) , and liquid crystals ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . since the core radius approach eliminates the non - integrability of @xmath32 around the dislocation , classical variational techniques can be used to tackle the problem .    the field @xmath18 can be approximated in @xmath33 by a sequence of fields @xmath34 , solutions to @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the outer unit normal to @xmath37 ( observe that in this case @xmath36 is the inner unit normal to @xmath38 ) , see @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.1 ) .",
    "system characterizes the minimizers of the energy functional @xmath39 notice that in the minimization problem the zero-@xmath17 condition is a consequence of the optimality , but it is necessary to have some regularity on the field @xmath40 , making the boundary condition meaningful ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , if @xmath41 , from stokes theorem the circulation of the minimizer on @xmath42 is @xmath7 . finally , observe that is well defined also if @xmath43 .",

    "we tackle the case of many dislocations . having @xmath81 dislocations in the crystal",
    "is equivalent to imposing a boundary datum with circulation equal to @xmath82 .",
    "this can be achieved in many ways : here we choose the tangential strain @xmath83 to be @xmath84 on @xmath22 , with @xmath55 as in .    in subsection [ subsect:2vs1",
    "] , we start by comparing the energy of one dislocation with the energy of two dislocations : more precisely , in theorem [ thm-5.1 ] we prove that if the boundary datum is @xmath85 , it is energetically convenient not to have two superposed dislocations with a total burgers vector of length @xmath86 , but to have two distinct dislocations with burgers vectors of length @xmath7 .",
    "the same behavior can be generalized to the scenarios where @xmath81 : to prove these results , culminating in theorem [ thgcn ] below , we will heavily use the theorems obtained for one dislocation .    in analogy with , for @xmath87",
    ", we define the energy of the @xmath0-tuple @xmath88 as @xmath89 here @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the space characterized by @xmath92 where @xmath23 is an arbitrary simple closed curve in @xmath93 winding once counterclockwise around @xmath94 dislocations . in the sequel , for the sake of brevity , we shall omit the dependence on both @xmath78 and the points @xmath95 for the space @xmath91 .",
    "notice that the spaces in are encapsulated , namely , if @xmath96 and if @xmath97 , then its restriction to @xmath98 belongs to @xmath99 , since @xmath100 . in virtue of this , it follows that @xmath101    a computation similar to shows that the energy defined in behaves asymptotically like @xmath102 as @xmath103 , where @xmath104 depends on the mutual positions of the dislocations . in particular ,",
    "if the @xmath105 s are all distinct and inside @xmath5 , the energy diverges like @xmath106 .",
    "this suggests us to study the @xmath1-limit of the rescaled functionals @xmath107 the expression of the @xmath1-limit is then provided by the following theorem .",

    "to keep the presentation of the results light , we shall omit to mention and in all of the following statements , given for granted that they are assumed throughout the paper .",
    "we collect here some final remarks . to start with",
    ", we stress that the convexity and regularity assumptions on @xmath20 stated in provide a _",
    "uniform interior cone condition _ of angle between    @xmath137 and @xmath138 , i.e. , ( see fig .",
    "[ alfa1 ] ) @xmath139 we point out that convexity and regularity play different roles : the former is conveniently assumed in order to simplify the exposition of the results ( in fact , it can be removed without changing their essence ) ; the latter , on the other hand , is fundamental .",
    "next , we observe that imposing the boundary condition of dirichlet type @xmath140 , with @xmath55 as in , is crucial : it serves the purpose of keeping the dislocations confined inside the material .",
    "in fact , the natural boundary conditions of neumann type imply that the dislocations migrate to the boundary and leave the domain , since , in such a case , the dirichlet energy of the system decreases as the dislocations approach @xmath22 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the particular choice of @xmath55 influences the positions of the dislocations and we reckon that our approach is forward looking to the tailoring of materials with specific chemical and physical properties .    finally , we mention that the assumption that all the burgers vectors are oriented in the same direction is a simplification introduced in our model .",
    "however , we expect that the configurations of minimal energy will not involve dislocations with burgers vectors oriented in opposite directions .",
    "the novelty of our work is to introduce the dirichlet boundary condition for the tangential strain . in this setting , we wish to investigate the consequences of this assumption in more general scenarios .",
    "this is object of future work .",
