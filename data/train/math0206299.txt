    "[ sec - intro ]    by lorentz gas ( lg ) we mean the free motion of a point particle in the plane subject to elastic collisions against a fixed array of dispersing scatterers .",
    "each scatterer  @xmath0 is an open , bounded , connected , simply connected , strictly convex domain of @xmath1 , with smooth boundary , and is labeled by the variable @xmath2 .",
    "the scatterers are assumed to be pairwise disjoint .",
    "a lg is called _ periodic _ when @xmath3 is left invariant by @xmath4 , a discrete group of translations in the plane , whose fundamental domain @xmath5 is compact .",
    "notice the departure from the usual terminology , whereby ` lorentz gas ' means ` periodic lorentz gas ' ( plg ) . to avoid possible confusions let us also recall that some literature calls ` lorentz gas ' the dynamical system  defined on @xmath5 , in the periodic case .",
    "however , common practice has nowadays christened such systems _",
    "sinai billiards_.    the lg has a long and honorable history .",
    "it was first introduced in its periodic and three - dimensional version by lorentz in 1905 , to describe the motion of an electron in a crystal @xcite .",
    "later in the century it became extremely popular in statistical mechanics and ergodic  theory .",
    "the scientific community was seeking a rather realistic model whose stochastic properties could be rigorously proven  in particular boltzmann s ergodic hypothesis ( namely , ergodicity ) .",
    "it is because of this connection with statistical mechanics that it was renamed ` lorentz _ gas _ ' . at this point",
    "the periodicity condition had lost its _",
    "raison dtre _ , but still remained in virtually all the publications ( at least as far as i know ) , on grounds of mathematical convenience .    as a matter of fact , most of the massive literature in this area of research",
    "is actually concerned with sinai billiards , and many results on the plg were generated as corollaries of theorems on the sinai billiard .",
    "it is definitely outside the scope of this introduction to mention all that is known about these systems , but it is worthwhile to recall that they are so termed after sinai , who in 1970 proved that they possess the @xmath6-property . the same result was extended to higher dimension by sinai and chernov in 1987 @xcite .",
    "( a rather complete reference on billiards is @xcite .",
    "the hasty reader may find a brief history of _ dispersing _ billiards in the introduction of @xcite . )    turning to lgs , it is not surprising that much less work has been done on them : the relevant invariant measure  for these systems is infinite , and ordinary ergodic  theory does not apply .",
    "still it makes sense to pose the question of the stochastic properties ; only , one must utilize a more refined ergodic  theory ( as found , e.g. , in the beautiful book by aaronson @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , the most sound definition of ergodicity in infinite measure  is the _ indecomposability _ of the system   modulo the measure . that is , a dynamical system  endowed with an invariant measure  @xmath7 is ergodic  when the only invariant subsets mod @xmath7 have measure  zero or are complements of zero - measure  sets ( cf",
    ".  definition [ def - erg ] later on ) .",
    "another question that arises immediately for infinite - measure  systems is that of recurrence ( cf .  definition [ def - rec ] ) , because the poincar recurrence theorem does not hold . for the plg",
    "this has baffled mathematicians for decades , and was answered in the affirmative only in the last few years , by schmidt @xcite and conze @xcite independently .",
    "both proofs use the central limit theorem ( for a suitable class of observables ) obtained by bunimovich and sinai in 1981 @xcite .",
    "all these results assume _ finite horizon _ : that is , the free path between collisions must be bounded above .",
    "recurrence implies ergodicity ( in the above sense ) by a result of simnyi @xcite .",
    "we finish this short review of the plg by mentioning a few other important properties that are not so central in the present work . again for finite - horizon gases , the dynamics is diffusive and converges to a brownian motion upon suitable rescaling @xcite ( see also @xcite . ) the finite - horizon condition appears to be physically relevant , as infinite - horizon plgs are believed to have a super - diffusive behavior ( the mean square displacement at time @xmath8 increasing like @xmath9 ) @xcite",
    ". a promising generalization of the central limit theorem is contained in a recent work by szsz and varj @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we treat the generic lg with finite horizon .",
    "subject to very mild conditions on the curvature of the scatterers and their relative position ( cf .  ( [ cond - k])-([cond - tau ] ) ) , we prove that recurrence implies ergodicity ( theorem [ thm - erg ] ) and we give several examples of recurrent aperiodic lgs ( propositions [ prop - fin - mod ] and [ prop - inf - mod ] ) .",
    "the exposition is thus organized : in section [ sec - prel ] we lay down the necessary definitions and basic facts about billiard  dynamics . in section [ sec - hyp ] we show that our systems are hyperbolic . in section [ sec - erg ]",
    "we give the ergodicity result . in section [ sec - rec ]",
    "we prove recurrence for a class of systems .    throughout the paper",
    "we use the theory of hyperbolic  systems with singularities without really reviewing it for the reader .",
    "rather , we try to be as precise as possible as to what part of the theory we are applying , or we need to modify , at any given time .",
    "standard references include @xcite .",
    "* acknowledgments . *",
    "my thanks to n.  chernov , n.  simnyi and d.  szsz for having shared with me their expertise on this subject .",

    "[ sec - prel ]    we study the billiard  dynamics on @xmath10 ( notation introduced in section [ sec - intro ] ) : a material point moves with constant velocity until it hits the boundary of its allowed domain .",
    "the point is then instantaneously scattered by the obstacle according to the fresnel law : the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection .",
    "it is clear that in this process the modulus of the velocity never changes ( a consequence of the conservation of energy for this singular hamiltonian system ) .",
    "so this modulus is conventionally fixed to be 1 .",
    "the dynamical system  thus defined is called the _",
    "billiard  flow _ on @xmath10 .    since for most of the time",
    "the dynamics is trivial , we take the point of view of discrete dynamical systems , and consider the poincar cross - section corresponding to collisions with the obstacles .",
    "more precisely , we restrict our phase space to points of the type @xmath11 , with @xmath12 , for some @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , such that @xmath15 and @xmath16 points outwardly with respect to @xmath0 . any such point",
    "is also called a _ line element _ and the whole set is denoted by @xmath17 . given an @xmath18 we define @xmath19 to be first line element , in the forward ( flow-)trajectory of @xmath20 , that belongs to @xmath17 ( see fig .",
    "[ faplg1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath21 is then the poincar map induced by the flow on the cross - section @xmath17 , and the @xmath21-  of @xmath20 is the sequence of snapshots of the flow - trajectory of @xmath20 , taken immediately after each collision .",
    "( in this work i will try to be as consistent as possible and use the term `  ' for an   of a map , such as @xmath21 ; and ` trajectory ' for an   of the billiard  flow . )",
    "[ faplg1 ]    a convenient way to parametrize the phase space is to consider , for each @xmath22 , the set @xmath23 $ ] , where @xmath24 is the circle of circumference @xmath25 ( i.e. , the interval @xmath26 $ ] after identification of the endpoints ) .",
    "a pair @xmath27 represents the unit vector , based on @xmath12 , that forms an angle @xmath28 with the clockwise tangent vector to @xmath29 in @xmath30 ; and @xmath30 is determined as the point whose clockwise distance along @xmath31 ( from a certain fixed origin ) is @xmath32see again fig .",
    "[ faplg1 ] .",
    "@xmath33 is thus the length of the closed curve @xmath31 . with a forgivable abuse of notation , then , the phase space is rewritten as @xmath34 ( the symbol denoting disjoint union ) .",
    "we endow @xmath17 with the measure  @xmath7 defined by @xmath35 .",
    "this is the physically relevant measure  because it is induced on @xmath17 by the liouville measure  for the billiard  flow ( which , by the way , is the uniform measure  both in the position and in the momentum coordinates ) .",
    "hence @xmath7 is preseved by @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "obviously @xmath36 . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", this is perhaps the most significant feature of the lorentz gas .",
    "it is well known that systems of the billiard  type are discontinuous : any line element @xmath20 whose trajectory is tangent to the next obstacle , say @xmath37 , is a point of discontinuity for @xmath21 , because other line elements arbitrarily close to @xmath20 may hit or miss @xmath37 , which causes @xmath38 to end up in completely different regions of the phase space . the discontinuity set is then given by @xmath39 .",
    "analogously , @xmath40 is the discontinuity set of @xmath41 .",
    "it is not hard to deduce that the differential of @xmath21 blows up at @xmath42 ( see below ) .",
    "therefore @xmath42 is usually called the _",
    "singularity set_. it is made up of smooth curves ( _ singularity lines _ ) with the property that the endpoints of any curve belong to other such curves @xcite .    for all elements in @xmath43 ,",
    "the differential of @xmath21 is known ( @xcite , @xcite ) and , however , easily computed with the help of fig .",
    "[ faplg1 ] and a little patience . denote by @xmath44 the _ free path _ of the line element @xmath20 .",
    "also , if @xmath45 , call @xmath46 the curvature of @xmath31 in the base - point of @xmath20 : this is a smooth function  by hypothesis , and positive by convention . also set @xmath47 ; @xmath48 ; @xmath49 ( if @xmath50 ) .",
    "then @xmath51 .",
    "\\label{dmap}\\ ] ]    before introducing the class of systems that we treat in this work we need a very important , although standard , definition .    the dynamical system  @xmath52 is said to be _ recurrent _ ( in the sense of poincar ) if , for every measurable set @xmath53 , the   of @xmath7-almost every @xmath54 returns to @xmath53 at least once ( and thus infinitely many times , due to the invariance of @xmath7 ) .",
    "[ def - rec ]    we need not require the above property to hold for both the forward and backward s because our systems are reversible ; i.e. , there exists a map @xmath55 on @xmath17 such that @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "( this map is of course @xmath58 . )",
    "since the poincar recurrence theorem fails here ( @xmath59 ) , one can not take definition [ def - rec ] for granted and indeed there are obvious cases of non - recurrent systems ",
    "think of a lg with finitely many scatterers .",
    "( in fact these open billiards are usually studied only on the recurrent part of their phase space @xcite . )",
    "let us accept the abuse of notation whereby @xmath60 means @xmath46 , for @xmath61 .",
    "then we denote by @xmath62 the class of all _ recurrent _ lgs for which there exist four positive numbers , @xmath63 , such that , @xmath64 , @xmath65 the first condition is of a physical nature : we want to model a gas , something that does not look much different in different parts of the plane .",
    "in fact , this condition and the convexity of the scatterers imply that no @xmath0 can be too big or too small ; more precisely @xmath66    condition ( [ cond - tau ] ) is primarily dictated by mathematical feasibility , as we will see later .",
    "however , the existence of an upper bound for the free path ( which goes by the name of _ finite - horizon condition _ ) does make a difference in the dynamics , as recalled in the introduction .",
    "for a given @xmath20 , define @xmath67 , that is , the second and fourth quadrant of @xmath68 in the @xmath69 basis .",
    "this is usually called the _ unstable cone _ at @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "take @xmath70 .",
    "any such vector is called _",
    "unstable_. the checkered sign configuration of ( [ dmap ] ) implies that @xmath71 , and @xmath72 therefore , if we define the metric @xmath73 and set @xmath74 , we obtain from ( [ cond - k])-([cond - tau ] ) : @xmath75 we name ( [ inc - norm ] ) the _ increasing norm _ for unstable vectors .",
    "[ sec - hyp ]    in this section we see how to construct local stable and unstable manifolds ( lsums ) for a.e .",
    "point of @xmath17 , and how to prove that they are absolutely continuous w.r.t .",
    "although the subject is very standard , it is useful for later purposes to state the definition of lsum .    for @xmath76 ,",
    "let us denote @xmath77 .",
    "given a point @xmath78 , we define a _ local ( un)stable manifold @xmath79 for @xmath21 at @xmath20 _ to be a @xmath80 curve containing @xmath20 in its ( one - dimensional ) interior , not intersecting @xmath81 , and such that :    * the tangent spaces to @xmath79 are included in the pull - backwards ( or push - forwards ) of all future ( past ) stable ( unstable ) cones .",

    "[ def - lsum ]    condition _ ( c ) _ is a sort of uniqueness property .",
    "for this reason we refer to any lsum as _ the _ lsum at @xmath20 and denote it by @xmath89 .",
    "one readily sees that @xmath90 is a lum at @xmath91 and @xmath92 is a lsm at @xmath93 .",
    "this earns the two collections of local stable and unstable manifolds the name of _ local invariant foliations_.    condition @xmath94 states that the tangent vectors to , say , @xmath95 are unstable ` at all orders ' .",
    "this and ( [ inc - lambda ] ) imply that if @xmath96 then , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the distance in the @xmath100-norm .",
    "we therefore say that @xmath95 is _ exponentially unstable _ in the increasing metric .",
    "we will see later that this property holds for the riemannian metric too .",
    "we do not recall the other basic notions of hyperbolic theory , such as the definition of absolutely continuous foliation .",
    "( the reader who would like to review the fundamentals of pesin s theory , especially in the context of billiards , can consult @xcite and the references therein . )    even as concerns proofs , we only show the details of a couple of lemmas that are specific to our system , and simply sketch the remaining customary arguments  mainly to convince the reader that the infiniteness of @xmath7 is no big trouble .",
    "it will also be noticed that the recurrence property is _ not _ needed here .",
    "the first observation one has to make to prove that a certain billiard  is hyperbolic  is that the singularities are not a big obstruction .",

    "obviously we can treat @xmath112 and @xmath113 separately . for the latter case",

    "in fact , any scatterer  `` seen '' from @xmath0 can only generate two tangent elements @xmath118 for any given @xmath32 , and , since @xmath0 is convex , @xmath28 must grow as @xmath32 increases ( cf .",
