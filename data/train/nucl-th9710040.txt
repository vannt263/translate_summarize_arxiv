    "the studies of fission dynamics has become a subject of current interest due to availability of recent experimental data for prescission neutron multiplicities in heavy ion induced fusion ",
    "fission reactions @xcite . from the analysis of the data ,",
    "it is by and large established that standard statistical theory could not account for the observed large multiplicity of the prescission neutrons .",
    "this discrepency is , nowadays , believed to be of dynamical origin , and thus led to enormous activities to understand theoretically the dynamics of fission process @xcite .",
    "dynamics of fission consists in the study of gradual change of shape of a fissioning compound nucleus . the shape is globally characterised in terms of elongation parameter , the neck radius and mass ratio of two fragments .",
    "these variables are usually referred to as collective variables and dynamics is understood in terms of the evolution of these collective variables .",
    "it has been observed that time taken by the compound nucleus from its state of formation to the state when it gets dissociated into the two fragments is too short when the shape evolves under the effect of the conservative forces derived from the coulomb and surface energy of the compound nucleus . with the average neutron evaporation rate determined by excitation of the compound nucleus , such large prescission neutron multiplicity data can not be explained in any manner with this short time scale of fission process .",
    "this feature leads one to believe that the dynamical process of shape evolution gets inhibited for a considerable amount of time .",
    "this retardation in the dynamics of collective variables is effected through a mechanism of dissipation by assuming the fissioning nucleus as a liquid drop .",
    "the dissipation is usually realised by introducing a friction term in the dynamics of shape evolution .",
    "thus , the explanation of the observed large neutron multiplicity points to two important features of the fission process ; the time scale of fission and the viscosity of the nuclear fluid .",
    "the dynamics of fission is then picturised as a dissipative process where initial energy of the collective variables get dissipated into the internal degrees of freedom of nuclear fluid giving rise to the increase in internal excitation energy , which , in turn , is responsible for the evaporation of prescission neutrons .",
    "there have been different approaches to study this problem .",
    "one approach is to solve the langevin equations for the collective variables @xcite . in this approach",
    ", one assumes the collective variable as the brownian particle interacting stochastically with large number of internal degrees of freedom constituting the surrounding bath. the systematic dissipative force is assumed to be derived from the random force averaged over a time larger than the collisional time scale between collective and internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the random part is modelled as a gaussian white noise which causes the fluctuation of the physical observables of the fission process such as kinetic energies , yields of the fission fragments etc . in the other approach ,",
    "one solves the multi - dimensional fokker - planck equation @xcite , which is a differential version of langevin equation . in both of these approaches ,",
    "the calculated average kinetic energies , average yield of the fission fragments and neutron multiplicity compare more or less well with the respective experimental data .    following an alternative approach , we proposed a dynamical model of fission @xcite , which could explain fairly well various features observed in fusion - fission reactions of lighter systems . in that model",
    ", we solved the euler - lagrange equations for the collective variables instead of solving the fokker - planck or langevin equations .",
    "the fluctuations are introduced at the initial level of the dynamics by random partitioning of available energy of the nascent compound nucleus between the collective and the intrinsic degrees of freedom and attributing the former to the generator of the displacement of the collective variable as an initial condition of euler - lagrange equation . the random initial momentum given to the collective variable",
    "gives rise to different trajectories .",
    "some of these trajectories would cross the fission barrier and have the fission fate. the main difference between our approach and those of the others is that in our approach the dynamics is deterministic with randomisation at initial level , while in other approaches , the dynamics is mainly stochastic in nature .",
    "however , in all these approaches the dissipation is introduced in terms of frictional forces .    in our earlier calculations",
    "@xcite we assumed a schematic shape of the fissioning system which comprised of two leptodermous spheres connected by a cylindrical neck .",
    "this particular idealisation was introduced by swiatecki @xcite to simplify the calculation of various ingredients such as conservative forces etc .",
    "after the saddle point , the neck gets constricted and at the scission point the spheres get detached forming two fission fragments .",
    "the calculation with such simple shape produced results which agree quite well with the experimental data , particularly for the nuclei lying below the bussinaro - gallone point .",
    "it is , however , known that for heavy nuclei lying above the businaro - gallone point , the fission shapes are highly deformed , and elongation is quite large before the nucleus reaches the scission point .",
    "obviously , the simple schematic shape parametrisation @xcite used earlier would not be expected to mimic such large deformed shapes .",
    "besides , the dissipation of collective energy to the internal nucleonic degrees of freedom could happen through two different mechanisms .",
    "one is due to two - body collision of the nucleons inside the nuclear fluid , the other is due to collision of nucleons with changing surface of the nuclear fluid , which is more commonly known as one - body or wall friction and both of them depend very sensitively on the surface profile of the fissioning system .",
    "hence , with these considerations in mind , in the present paper , we have used a more realistic shape parametrisation of the heavy fissioning systems to study the temporal evolution of fission shapes , and , subsequently , to calculate various observables of the fission process , such as prescission neutron multiplicities , total kinetic energies etc .",
    "the present paper has been arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we describe the model and the statistics used in calculating the average kinetic energies , prescission neutron multiplicities etc .",

    "[ conclud ] .",
    "the present model is a generalisation of the schematic model developed by us @xcite to study the fusion - fission process for light nuclear systems lying below the businaro - gallone point .",
    "the schematic parametrisation for the evolution of fission shapes used in the earlier work has been replaced by a more realistic parametrisation for the same that is applicable for heavier nuclei with fissility parameters above the businaro - gallone value .",
    "the shape of the nuclear surface is assumed to be of the form    @xmath0    where the coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 are defined as    @xmath3    @xmath4    this is a specific form of the surface introduced by brack et .",

    "there are three real points at which the derivative of @xmath11 vanishes ; two of them correspond to maximum of @xmath11 and between these two maxima one minimum occurs at @xmath12 .",
    "the portion of volume contained in @xmath13 to @xmath12 is defined as left lobe and remaining portion of the volume is referred to as right lobe .",

    "the parameter @xmath6 is related to the asymmetry @xmath14 through the following relation    @xmath18    as the shape changes gradually , the coordinates of the two maxima and that of the minimum change .",

    "as prescission neutron multiplicities depend on time scale of the fission process and _ vis - a - vis _ on the magnitude of nuclear friction , theoretical estimates of the friction coefficients are usually made by reproducing the prescission neutron multiplicity data using friction coefficient as an input parameter in the model . in the present calculations ,",

    "the time scales vary in the range of 0.5 to 1.5 ( @xmath175 sec . ) as asymmetry parameter @xmath6 decreases from 0.1 to 0 .",
    "a similar trend is observed in the variation of @xmath139 .",
    "to sum up , we have developed a dynamical model for fission where fission trajectories are generated by solving euler - lagrange equations of motion using a combination of one- and two - body frictions .",
    "evolution of shapes of the fissioning nuclei have been computed from the generalised shape parametrisation of brack _ et .",
    "different friction form factors have been used for ground state to saddle and saddle to scission regions . in the ground state to saddle region , the one body wall friction has been used with an attenuation coefficient of 0.1 , whereas the two body dissipative forces , derived from werner - wheeler prescription , have been used in the saddle to scission region with the value of the two body viscosity coefficient @xmath176 .",
    "same values of the friction coefficients have been used for all the systems considered here . with these values of friction coefficients , the typical time scales of fission",
    "as obtained from the present calculations were @xmath177 sec .",
    "for symmetric fission , which are similar to the values reported earlier in the literature .",
    "emission of neutrons along the fission trajectories has been simulated through monte - carlo simulation technique .",
    "the evolution of the fission trajectories has been corrected for prescission proton emission , which has been simulated in a similar way as it was done for neutron emission .",
    "however , the prescission proton emission was found to be quite small compared to the neutron emission for the systems considered in the present studies .",
    "the emission of complex particles ( d , t , @xmath178he etc . ) and their effects on prescision neutron emission has been neglected in the present calculation as it is difficult to incorporate them in the present model because of their composite nature .",
    "generally complex particle emission is much less as compared to the neutron emission ; however , for some fissioning nuclei @xmath6 emission may be relatively favoured due to structure effects and it may affect the neutron multiplicity and other fission observables .",
    "theoretical predictions for prescission neutron multiplicities , total kinetic energies and the mean energies of the prescission neutrons , for all the systems considered here , agree quite well with the corresponding available experimental data .    in the present model , the fragment mass asymmetry dependence of the prescission neutron multiplicities and other physically relevent quantities have also been studied .",
    "it has been found that with the inclusion of an extra factor ( @xmath179 , @xmath171=161@xmath1803 ) in the friction form factor ( eqn .",
    "[ eq.10 ] ) , the observed decrease of the prescission neutron multiplicities with the increase in fragment mass asymmetry , are explained fairly well with the same value of the viscosity coefficient @xmath42 as used in the case of symmetric fission .",
    "further , it has been observed that the prescission neutron multiplicities as well as fission time are weakly dependent on the angular momentum of the fissioning system .",
    "however , the fission times are found to be strongly dependent upon the fragment mass asymmetry and decrease from 1.5 to 0.5 ( @xmath175 sec . ) as the the asymmetry parameter @xmath6 increase from 0.0 to 0.1 .    to conclude , in the present model , with the generalised shape parametrisation and modified werner - wheeler friction form factor",
    ", both symmetric and asymmetric splitting of the compound nucleus can be treated on the same footing .",
    "the present model is quite successful in explaining prescission neutron multiplicities , total fragment kinetic energies , average energies of the prescission neutrons , as well as their fragment mass asymmetry dependence .",
