    "a general consensus is emerging from local studies that the hubble constant @xmath0 lies in the range @xmath8@xmath9 km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2  ( e.g.  freedman , madore & kennicutt 1996 ) , based primarily on cepheid distances to nearby galaxies combined with type ia supernovae to reach regions of pure hubble flow ( e.g.  riess , press & kirshner 1996 ) .",
    "the resulting age estimates are in weak conflict with the estimated ages of the oldest stars for almost all cosmological models ( e.g.  bolte & hogan 1995 ) . measurements of time delays in gravitational lenses can directly determine @xmath0 over cosmological distances ( refsdal 1964 ) , thereby avoiding the complicated calibration problems that plague local distance estimates . in a gravitational lens ,",
    "the ray trajectories of the multiple images have different geometric lengths and pass through different parts of the gravitational potential , so the light travel time is different for each image .",
    "the light travel time is inversely proportional to @xmath0 , so combining observed time delays between images with a model of the gravitational potential gives the hubble constant .",

    "most recently , grogin and narayan ( 1996 ) considered a spherical softened power - law model for the primary lens galaxy and an external shear for the surrounding cluster .",

    "bar - kana ( 1997 ) , however , reanalyzed the data to show that including the correlations in the photometric errors gives @xmath25 days and @xmath26 ( statistical ) , with a @xmath27 systematic uncertainty in @xmath28 associated with different assumptions about how to treat the photometric errors .",
    "115  is a promising candidate for combining time delays with lens models to determine @xmath0 , because four - image lens geometries can constrain some aspects of lens models better than two - image lens geometries ( kovner 1987 ; kochanek 1991a ) .",
    "115  has been modeled extensively .",

    "further models showed that an isothermal sphere or a point mass with a variety of quadrupole structures could reproduce the image positions to within ground - based observational errors , but that the observations were not accurate enough to distinguish between the various monopole and quadrupole forms ( kochanek 1991a ) .",
    "more accurate observations with the hubble space telescope ( kristian et al .",

    "their value for @xmath0 is in strong conflict with local estimates of @xmath31@xmath9 km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 , so it is crucial to understand the systematic uncertainties in the lens models and their effects on the inferred value of @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , if we hope to use lensing to measure @xmath0 with precision comparable to the distance ladder , then we must understand which future observations can reduce the uncertainties in the lens models .    in this paper",
    "we examine the systematic uncertainties in the value of @xmath0 inferred from 115  by exploring the uncertainties in the lens models .",
    "since present observations of the galaxy and group do not directly constrain their mass distributions and only weakly constrain their positions , we postulate a wide range of plausible galaxy and group properties . specifically , we model the galaxy as an ellipsoidal mass distribution with a range of profiles including constant mass - to - light ratio models , standard dark matter models , and more centrally - concentrated models .",
    "we model the group as a circular mass distribution with an extended ( isothermal ) or concentrated ( point mass ) profile .",

    "3 we consider a broad range of models using only the primary lens galaxy and show that they can not fit the data . in  4 we study models adding the nearby group and show that a variety of galaxy+group models give good fits .",

    "5 we illustrate an independent way to break one degeneracy by using stellar dynamics and the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies to identify which galaxy profiles are physically plausible . in  6",

    "we considered a standard dark matter model treating the group as a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) , and we studied the effects of making it more centrally concentrated by considering the limit of a point mass .",

    "the galaxy position and the four quasar positions and fluxes provide @xmath94 constraints . a galaxy model with @xmath81 or @xmath95 fixed has five free parameters ( @xmath96 , @xmath75 , @xmath77 , and @xmath82 ) .",
    "a group model has one parameter ( @xmath97 ) if the position is fixed and three parameters if the position is variable .",

    "( 1997 ) or @xmath121 for the time delays of bar - kana ( 1997 ) .",
    "a simple constant @xmath78 galaxy can not describe 115 .    for the softened power - law models , we tabulated the results in the plane of the core radius @xmath86 and the power - law exponent @xmath85 ( see ) .",
    "generally the softened power - law profiles fit much better than the de vaucouleurs profile but still do not give a good fit .",

    "as @xmath86 or @xmath85 decreases , the models become more centrally - concentrated and imply larger values for @xmath0 ; this is because @xmath0 scales as @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the convergence at the critical radius ( falco et al .  1985 ) , and the models with steeper profiles have a smaller @xmath129 .",

    "first , observations of galactic cores show that the luminosity densities of elliptical galaxies do not have flat cores but instead have central cusps ( gebhardt et al .",
    "second , it is generally argued that small core radii are needed to fit lens data , both because almost all known lenses lack a central image , and because stellar dynamics , lens statistics , and other lens models are consistent with isothermal mass distributions with small core radii ( narasimha , subramanian & chitre 1986 ; kassiola & kovner 1993 ; wallington & narayan 1993 ; kochanek 1993 , 1995 , 1996 ; grogin & narayan 1996 ) .",
    "contrary to these expectations , 115  can not be fit by an isolated lens galaxy with a small core radius .",
    "it is difficult , though , to draw strong conclusions from this result because the `` best - fit '' model is still not a good fit ( @xmath122 ) , while once we include the perturbation from the group we will find good fits ( @xmath142 ) with galaxies that do have a small core radius .",
    "we conclude that 115  can not be fit by an isolated lens galaxy , and thus it is not reasonable to use such a model to estimate @xmath0 .",
    "keeton et al .  ( 1997a ) found that while 115  could not be fit by an isolated isothermal galaxy , it could be well fit by an ellipsoidal galaxy with an independent external shear .",

    "unfortunately , the data can not constrain the profiles for two reasons . first , although the four - image configuration constrains the total mass within the critical radius , it does not constrain the distribution of the mass ( kochanek 1991a ; wambsganss & paczyski 1994 ) .",
    "second , although the quasar images constrain the shear from the group , they do not constrain its mass or convergence . as a result , we can have a wide range of galaxy and group profiles that are all consistent at the @xmath130 level , and by using different profiles we can produce @xmath135 anywhere from @xmath114 to more than @xmath158 without significantly changing the goodness of fit . as we show in  5",

    "restricting attention to plausible dark matter and constant @xmath78 models restricts the range of @xmath135 to @xmath159 .      while fixing the group at the flux centroid c4 allowed us to isolate the effects of the profiles of the galaxy and group",
    ", there is no strong observational evidence requiring it .",

    "we studied the effects of the group position for two galaxy models : a dark matter ( isothermal ) model and a constant @xmath78 model .",

    "we neglected the more centrally concentrated galaxy models because , as we show in  5 , they require galaxies that are unphysical .",
    "for the group we again used the sis and point mass models .",
    "physically we expect the group to be described by an isothermal dark matter halo , but by including the point mass group we can examine the effects of making the group more concentrated . since these two galaxy profiles and two group profiles span the expected range of mass profiles , they should span the expected range of @xmath0 .",

    "the singular isothermal ellipsoid ( dark matter ) galaxy permits good fits for a wide range of group positions ( see ) . with an sis group ,",
    "the best - fit model is at @xmath160 and @xmath161 , has @xmath162 for @xmath99 , and implies @xmath163 .",
    "but at the @xmath130 level , @xmath164 can range from @xmath165 to @xmath166 and @xmath143 can be as small as a few arcseconds .",
    "the hubble constant varies considerably over the allowed region , from @xmath167 for distant groups with @xmath168 ,",
    "to @xmath169 for nearby groups or for distant groups with @xmath170 .",
    "note that there is no formal upper limit on @xmath143 from the @xmath93 , because for a distant group the non - linear terms are weak and the perturbation is equivalent to a simple external shear , which we know fits well ( keeton et al .",
    "however , the mass of the group increases with its distance ( @xmath171 ) , so requiring that the group have a reasonable mass can constrain its position .",
    "it is convenient to study the mass of the group in terms of its mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath78 ) , and it is convenient to express the @xmath78 of the group in units of the @xmath78 of the galaxy because this ratio is independent of assumptions about the cosmology and about the @xmath172 and evolutionary corrections to the luminosities .",
    "the models with the group in a band from the centroid c4 to the best - fit group position have @xmath173 .",
    "the galaxy mass within the critical radius ( radius @xmath174 kpc ) is @xmath175 , with a @xmath176 uncertainty due to the position of the group , a @xmath177 uncertainty ( upwards ) due to making the group more centrally concentrated , and a @xmath73 uncertainty ( upwards ) due to the cosmological model .",
    "using the k93 f785lp central aperture magnitude together with color , @xmath172 , and evolutionary corrections from the galaxy evolution models of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) , we estimated the present @xmath20 magnitude of the galaxy to be @xmath178 mag for an @xmath36 cosmology ( see keeton et al.1997b for details ) , although the effective aperture of the k93 magnitude is unclear .",
    "this gives @xmath179 , which is consistent with other lens models ( keeton et al .",
    "1997b ) and lens statistics ( kochanek 1993 , 1996 ; maoz & rix 1993 ) .",
    "this in turn implies @xmath180 , which is consistent with observed group mass - to - light ratios , e.g.  @xmath181 ( ramella , pisani & geller 1997 ) .",
    "it is difficult at present to apply strong constraints from this reasoning , but it is clear that the group positions that give good fits also give reasonable group masses and that the group should not be much closer or much farther away .    shows that at present the constraints on @xmath0 are relatively weak .",
    "nevertheless , the models imply several physical properties that may be better constrained by future observations .",
    "first , the galaxy positions differ at the level of tens of mas .",
    "while the k93 position is well within the range of good fits , the @xmath3 mas error bars are too broad to rule out many models . reducing the error bars on the galaxy position to @xmath182 mas or better",
    "would greatly improve the constraints on the models .",
    "second , the galaxy axis ratios vary .",
    "the galaxy is strictly circular if the group is at @xmath183 , @xmath184 ( which reproduces the double sis model of schechter et al .",
    "1997 ) . for other group positions",
    "the galaxy s ellipticity and orientation adjust so the combined shear from the galaxy and group gives a good fit .",
    "the ellipticity needs to vary by only a few times @xmath185 in order to produce good fits for a wide variety of group positions . finally , the time delays vary .",
    "although it was not included as a constraint , the ratio @xmath28 is marginally consistent with the value @xmath121 of bar - kana ( 1997 ) given his systematic uncertainties of @xmath27 .",
    "note that no models produce a time delay ratio consistent with the value @xmath186 of schechter et al .",
    "the time delay ratio could provide a strong constraint on the models if the systematic effects in the observed ratio were understood and if the uncertainties were reduced to @xmath187 .",
    "this would require roughly a factor of four reduction in the uncertainties in the time delays , or uncertainties of @xmath188 days .",
    "we note also that the variation of the @xmath189 time delay with group position differs from that of the @xmath190 and @xmath191 time delays , so this time delay could provide an independent constraint .",
    "however , @xmath192 hours over the @xmath130 region so this time delay would need to be known at the level of @xmath5 hour in order to constrain the models .",
    "the results are similar for the modified hubble model ( constant @xmath78 ) galaxy , except that good fits are limited to a narrower range of group positions ( see ) . with a fixed core radius @xmath193 ( @xmath194 kpc ) and a point mass group ,",
    "the best - fit model is at @xmath195 and @xmath196 , has @xmath197 for @xmath99 , and implies @xmath198 . at the @xmath130 level",
    ", @xmath164 is restricted to @xmath199 and the group can be no closer than @xmath200 . as with the isothermal galaxy ,",
    "the hubble constant varies considerably over the @xmath130 region , ranging from @xmath152 to @xmath201 .",
    "however , again physical parameters including the galaxy position , the galaxy axis ratio , and the time delays may be constrained by further observations to improve the constraints on @xmath0 . in particular , note that the modified hubble galaxy predicts a time delay ratio that is closer to the observed value of bar - kana ( 1997 ) than the ratio predicted by the isothermal galaxy . although it is not shown ,",
    "the predicted time delay ratio is essentially independent of the profile of the group . thus if bar - kana s ( 1997 ) value remains valid as its uncertainties",
    "are reduced , then it may provide the strongest probe of the galaxy profile .",
    "we will return to this point below .",
    "given the wide range of group positions that provide good fits , it is difficult to use the @xmath93 statistic to place limits on @xmath0 .",
    "we can , however , use a bayesian analysis to give a reasonable estimate of the systematic uncertainties .",
    "using bayes s theorem we can convert the probability of the data given the parameters ( given by @xmath202 ) into the probability of the parameters given the data .",
    "we can then compute the probability distribution for @xmath0 by integrating over the group position , weighted by a `` prior '' probability distribution which we took to be a circular gaussian distribution centered on the flux centroid c4 with standard deviation given by the rms distance of the four galaxies from the centroid .",
    "this is roughly the same as the range of group positions permitted by the group mass - to - light ratio . with the probability distribution for @xmath0",
    "we can characterize the systematic uncertainties in @xmath0 due to the group position , and also estimate the relative likelihoods of the four classes of galaxy / group profiles .",
    "in addition , because the four classes of profiles span the range of physically plausible models ( a dark matter or constant @xmath78 galaxy , and an extended or concentrated group ) , we can combine them to produce a `` total '' probability distribution that includes the systematic effects of both the group position and the galaxy / group profiles . shows the normalized probability distributions and inferred values of @xmath0 for the four classes of models , together with the total probability distribution .",
    "since the time delay ratio @xmath28 may provide a strong constraint on the galaxy profile but is still relatively uncertain , we have computed the probability distributions with and without the formal @xmath28 constraint from bar - kana ( 1997 ) .",
    "the bayesian analysis emphasizes two important features of the uncertainties in @xmath0 due to systematic uncertainties in the lens models .",
    "first , using two independent shears ( an ellipsoidal galaxy and a movable group ) strongly affects @xmath0 .",
    "dark matter models that have only a single variable shear , such as the models of schechter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) with a circular galaxy or the models of  4.1 with the group position fixed , give @xmath203 km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 .",
    "by contrast , dark matter models with two shears give @xmath204 km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 .",
    "thus to understand the systematic uncertainties in @xmath0 it is important to consider models with two independent shears .",
    "moreover , since lens models that require two independent shears often have a degeneracy between the shears ( keeton et al .",
    "1997a ) , such models will generically produce large uncertainties in @xmath0 that can be reduced only by improving the constraints on the models .",
    "second , the time delay ratio @xmath28 is an important constraint on the profile of the galaxy .",
    "the current estimate reduces the range of models that are consistent with the data ( especially the models that predict large @xmath0 ) , and reduces the probability of the isothermal galaxy compared with the hubble galaxy . without the @xmath28 constraint ,",
    "the isothermal galaxy is more likely than the hubble galaxy by a ratio of @xmath205 , largely because the isothermal galaxy allows such a wide range of group positions .",
    "by contrast , with the @xmath28 constraint the hubble galaxy increases in likelihood because it produces values for @xmath28 that are more consistent with bar - kana s ( 1997 ) value . reducing the uncertainties in @xmath28",
    "thus should help discriminate between the dark matter and constant @xmath78 galaxy models and provide the best probe of the galaxy profile . using the formal @xmath28 constraint from bar - kana s ( 1997 ) present estimate",
    ", the total probability distribution gives @xmath1 km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 , where these error bars incorporate most of the systematic uncertainties in the lens models due to the group position and the galaxy / group profiles .",
    "to this point we have evaluated models purely on their ability to fit the gravitational lens data , and we have found that the data leave significant degeneracies in the models .",
    "one degeneracy is related to the galaxy profile , but here we can apply independent constraints to try to break the degeneracy . specifically , we can consider whether the galaxies required to fit the lensing data are consistent with stellar dynamics .",
    "for example , we suspect that the centrally concentrated models  the models that allow high values for @xmath0may be unphysical .",
    "the absence of information on the optical structure of the lens galaxy limits the conclusions that can be drawn from stellar dynamical models because such models require the luminosity distribution to estimate the stellar velocities .",
    "we assume that the galaxy is an early - type galaxy because of its high mass and the expected dominance of lens statistics by early - type galaxies .",
    "early - type galaxies are known to obey a strong correlation between velocity dispersion , effective radius , and magnitude known as the fundamental plane ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al .",
    "1987 ) , and we can estimate whether the lens galaxy as constrained by the lens models can lie on the fundamental plane .",
    "kochanek ( 1993 , 1996 ) , breimer & sanders ( 1993 ) , and grogin & narayan ( 1996 ) have previously explored using stellar dynamical models as an added check on lens models .    for our comparison sample",
    "we adopted the data of jrgensen , franx & kjrgaard ( 1995a , b , hereafter jfk ) .",
    "shows the jfk sample in the space of @xmath206 and @xmath207 shifted to the redshift of 115 .",
    "the velocity dispersion @xmath208 was estimated for a fixed metric aperture of @xmath209 in diameter at coma ( corresponding to @xmath210 at 115  for @xmath36 ) . in order to compare the k93 and jfk photometry",
    ", we converted the jfk gunn @xmath151 magnitudes to the k93 f785lp band by using the galaxy evolution models of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) to compute the @xmath172 and evolutionary corrections and the @xmath211 color ( see keeton et al .",
    "1997b for details ) .",
    "we assumed that the luminosity density can be modeled by a hernquist ( 1990 ) distribution with hernquist scale length @xmath212 , and we calculated only isotropic stellar dynamical models . from the models in  4.2 , we know that with an sis group the mass inside the ring of images ( radius @xmath174 kpc ) is @xmath175 , with a @xmath176 uncertainty due to the position of the group , a @xmath177 uncertainty ( upwards ) due to making the group more centrally concentrated , and a @xmath73 uncertainty ( upwards ) due to the cosmological model .",
    "superimposes the predicted 115  aperture velocity dispersion as a function of effective radius on the jfk sample .",
    "the self - gravitating hernquist ( constant @xmath78 ) models have diverging central velocity dispersions for small effective radii because the mass is fixed by the lens model , forcing @xmath213 for effective radii smaller than the ring defined by the images .",
    "the effective radius is restricted to the rough range @xmath103 if the galaxy is to lie on the fundamental plane ; then from  4.1 the de vaucouleurs models with fixed group give @xmath214 with an sis group and @xmath215 with a point mass group .",
    "surprisingly , the dark matter models tend to have dispersion estimates that move along the fundamental plane . nonetheless , many of the centrally - concentrated lens models that lead to high values for @xmath0 require a galaxy off the fundamental plane ; for example , the @xmath89 model with @xmath216 that produces @xmath217 lies to the right of the jfk sample .",
    "these fundamental plane constraints can be made quantitative once we know the lens galaxy structure and effective radius .",
    "note that the hernquist models require a total lens galaxy magnitude of @xmath218 in order to lie on the fundamental plane , whereas k93 estimated a central aperture magnitude for the lens galaxy of @xmath219 mag .",
    "we experimented with the k93 images and found that , due to the wings of the original wfpc point - spread function and to the huge contrast between the quasar and galaxy surface brightnesses , the data are consistent with lens models having @xmath218 and @xmath220@xmath221 .",
    "in addition , keeton et al .",
    "( 1997b ) have remarked that the k93 magnitude estimate gives a luminosity well below that expected from the `` faber  jackson '' type relation between image separation and lens luminosity that other lenses obey . a higher luminosity for the 115  lens galaxy would move it closer to the trend followed by other lenses .",
    "improved hst photometry will reveal whether this is indeed the case .",
    "although this analysis is limited at present by the lack of optical data on the lens galaxy , it does reveal that the centrally - concentrated galaxy models that give high values for @xmath0 are physically implausible .",
    "the dark matter models are consistent with stellar dynamics , as are the constant @xmath78 models if the effective radius is in the range @xmath103 .",
    "by combining a lens model of 115  with the observed time delays of bar - kana ( 1997 ) , we can infer a value for @xmath0 that is independent of the standard distance ladder .",
    "the resulting value depends on the lens model , so we explored a range of models to understand the systematic uncertainties in the models , their effects on @xmath0 , and the types of future observations that can reduce the uncertainties .",
    "we found that 115  can not be fit by an isolated lens galaxy , but that it can be well fit ( @xmath155 ) by including the effects of the nearby group . to understand the full range of model uncertainties , it is important to use an ellipsoidal galaxy and a movable group . since the present observational data do not constrain the galaxy and group profiles or the group position , we studied various profiles and group positions and found good fits with @xmath0 ranging from roughly @xmath222 to @xmath223 km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 .",
    "however , many of these models are unacceptable on physical grounds . for example",
    ", some of the models that give high values for @xmath0 require a galaxy mass profile that is more centrally concentrated than typical luminosity profiles and correspond to a galaxy that does not lie on the fundamental plane .",
    "if we restrict the models to a plausible constant @xmath78 model and a dark matter model , we can use a bayesian analysis to characterize the systematic uncertainties in @xmath0 relating to degeneracies in the models .",
    "we find @xmath1 km  s@xmath2",
    "mpc@xmath2 , where the error bars incorporate the uncertainty in the measured time delays as well as the uncertainties in the lens models due to the group position and the galaxy and group profiles .",
    "they do not , however , take into account the systematic uncertainties in the value of the time delay ratio @xmath28 from bar - kana ( 1997 ) .",
    "in addition to the formal uncertainties , there may be a @xmath44@xmath177 uncertainty due to mass fluctuations from large - scale structure ( bar - kana 1996 ; wambsganss et al .",
    "1997 ) , and a @xmath73 uncertainty ( upwards ) due to the cosmological model ( ) .    the uncertainties in @xmath0 can be reduced with better observational constraints , but perhaps surprisingly not with better relative quasar positions and fluxes . in most models",
    "the quasar positions are already overfit , and an order of magnitude improvement in the uncertainties ( to @xmath224 mas ) is not practical .",
    "the quasar fluxes , by contrast , are dominated by systematic effects from microlensing and extinction rather than by measurement errors .",
    "we accounted for these effects by using flux error bars of @xmath45 ; merely reducing the flux error bars by a factor of two changes the absolute @xmath93 but has little effect on the best - fit model parameters . improving the constraints from the quasar fluxes would require understanding the systematic effects of microlensing and extinction , and in particular understanding why the k93 value of the @xmath225 flux ratio ( @xmath226 in @xmath227 and @xmath228 in @xmath229 ) differs from the best - fit models ( typically @xmath230 ) and from theoretical expectations of a value near unity .",
    "one way to avoid problems with microlensing and extinction would be to measure radio flux ratios ; unfortunately 115  is not a strong radio source ( flux @xmath231 mjy ; weymann et al .  1980 ) .",
    "the most promise for improving the constraints comes from the galaxy position and the time delays ( see  4.2 ) .",
    "reducing the error bars on the galaxy position from @xmath3 mas to @xmath182 mas or better will rule out many models , and such a reduction should be possible with new wfpc2 observations . reducing the error bars on the time delays by a factor of four ( to @xmath5 day in the time delays or to @xmath232 in @xmath28 ) will provide a useful independent constraint .",
    "in fact , the time delay ratio @xmath28 may provide the best probe of the galaxy profile .",
    "the effects of the galaxy position and the time delay ratio can be seen by noting that , together with the convergence at the ring of images , they account for almost all of the variation in @xmath0 from model to model .",
    "if we combine the models from  4.1 ( different galaxy profiles with varying core radius and fixed group ) and the models from  4.2 ( singular isothermal ellipsoid or modified hubble model galaxy , with movable group ) , then the implied hubble constant is correlated with the galaxy position and the time delay ratio , @xmath233 ( 1-\\kappa_0)\\ ] ] where @xmath234 and @xmath235 are the galaxy position in mas relative to that of k93 , and @xmath236 is the total convergence at the ring of images due to the galaxy and the group . for a singular isothermal galaxy @xmath237 at the ring of the images ; for an sis group @xmath238 in 115 , while for a point mass group @xmath148 .",
    "this correlation is meant only as a qualitative guide to the quantities that will best constrain the hubble constant , and it does not address the degree to which the convergence @xmath129 can be determined from improved data .",
    "if even with improved constraints we still can not determine the galaxy and group profiles and the group position directly , then perhaps we can impose external considerations .",
    "first , as in  5 we can use stellar dynamics and the fundamental plane to identify which models are physically plausible . at present",
    "this analysis can only rule out very concentrated models , but with luminosity profile data for the galaxy it may provide a more quantitative constraint . unfortunately , directly measuring the central velocity dispersion in 115  will be very difficult due to the high quasar / galaxy contrast .",
    "second , we could require consistency with other gravitational lens statistics and models ( grogin & narayan 1996 ; kassiola & kovner 1993 ; kochanek 1993 , 1995 , 1996 , wallington & narayan 1993 ; maoz & rix 1993 ) and with observations of elliptical galaxies ( fabbiano 1989 ; rix 1996 ) to say that lens galaxies have significant dark matter and small core radii . in this case",
    ", the models from  4.2 give @xmath239 km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2  using the @xmath28 constraint .",
    "finally , there are now two lenses ( 0957@xmath7561 and 115 ) for which time delays have been measured . both systems exhibit a degeneracy between the mass distribution and the hubble constant ( e.g.  grogin & narayan 1996 ) , but by requiring the lenses to agree on both the hubble constant and the typical mass distributions of galaxies we may be able to break the degeneracies",
