    "principal features observed during flares include strong continuum radiation rising toward the blue and near - ultraviolet ; broad , enhanced hydrogen balmer series emission lines ; enhanced emission in high temperature lines such as he i , he ii , c iv , n v , si iv ; enhanced xray emission ; and bursts of radio emission ( e.g. kunkel 1967 , jackson et al .",

    "the data presented here were obtained as part of a larger multiwavelength campaign to observe yz cmi in 2000 .",
    "we use these near - ultraviolet spectra to examine the mg ii and fe ii emission line profiles in yz cmi during quiescence and flares , and to study the behavior of the mg ii emission in the flares that are large enough to be subdivided into separate , time - resolved flare spectra .",
    "we also compare the observational data for these chromospheric lines with predictions from our new generation of radiative hydrodynamic models ( allred et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "the new models incorporate detailed radiative transfer in atmospheres heated by non - thermal electrons and undergoing significant mass motions as heated material flows upward ( evaporation ) and downward ( condensation ) within a magnetic loop .",
    "the models were designed to predict velocities and line profiles of chromospheric emission lines , and are therefore suitable for comparison with the mg ii observations described here .",

    "the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis , kimball et al .",
    "1998 ) , was used with the medium resolution nuv echelle grating ( e230 m ) and the 0.2x0.2 arcsec aperture .",
    "the e230 m spectra have a nearly constant ( @xmath2% ) dispersion of 4.88 km / s per pixel .",
    "the line spread function ( lsf ) for the 0.2x0.2 arcsec aperture has a fwhm of 1.8 - 1.9 pixels over the wavelength range 2400 - 2800 , corresponding to a resolving power of r=33,000 .",
    "these are the only stis spectra of an m dwarf flare star at nuv wavelengths that exist in the hst archive .",
    "data were obtained during six consecutive orbits , with exposure times ranging from 32 to 40 minutes , over a 6.5 hour total timespan .",
    "the mama detector timetag mode was used for the observations , resulting in an event list for each exposure that contains the detection time and location of every detected photon .    to construct light curves of the integrated light obtained during each exposure",
    ", we used an extraction window that was 11 pixels wide , centered on each echelle order , to assign all timetag events to either source or background regions on the mama detector .",
    "we then divided each exposure into 100 uniform time bins ( 19 - 24 s in duration depending on the individual exposure lengths which range from 32 - 40 min , see table 1 ) , obtaining separate light curves for the source and background regions . for each exposure , we fitted the background light curve with a sixth order polynomial , scaled the result by the ratio of source to background pixels , and then subtracted this predicted background from the source light curve to obtain a total observed stellar count rate for each time bin .",
    "errors for each time bin include poisson noise from the subtracted background .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the resulting light curves for the six exposures .",
    "the flaring and quiet intervals f1 - 10 and q1 - 8 were assigned by qualitative inspection of the light curves , and are labeled on the figure .",

    "column 1 lists the number of the exposure containing the time interval .",
    "exposure number n maps to hst dataset o59k010n0 .",
    "the second and third columns give the start and end time of each interval , expressed in minutes since the beginning of each exposure . column 4 gives the label assigned to each time interval , with q labels indicating quiet intervals and f labels indicating flare intervals .",
    "the numbers were assigned sequentially in time for individual intervals .",
    "columns 5 and 6 give the total count rate and standard deviation for each interval .",
    "although the flaring and quiet intervals were assigned qualitatively , it is clear from these data that the flaring intervals have both higher count rates and larger scatter .",
    "the exceptions are the late decay phases of the two large flares , labeled as f2c and f9c .",
    "since we wanted to investigate the evolution of the emission lines in these late phases , we retain those as flare intervals .",
    "also note that quiet interval q7 has a relatively high count rate and shows significant low level variability in the light curve , but no obvious flares .",
    "we include it as a quiet interval after insuring that the q7 spectrum shows no more than 1.2% variation compared to the summed quiet spectrum over all other intervals . since q7 represents almost one - third of the quiet exposure time , including it increases the signal - to - noise of the summed quiet spectrum .",
    "we used the iraf package stsdas ( version 3.3.1 , 2005 march 31 ) to split the timetag event lists into the quiet and flaring time intervals and then to extract spectra for these intervals . to split the event lists",
    ", we used the task inttag ( version 1.1 , 2000 january 26 ) . to extract the spectra",
    ", we used the task calstis ( version 2.18 , 2005 february 15 ) with the best calibration reference files available on 2005 july 10 .",
    "the calibration process removed radial velocity shifts caused by orbital motion of the spacecraft around the earth and the earth around the sun .",

    "yz cmi has a measured rotation velocity @xmath3 sin @xmath4 = 6.5 km sec@xmath1 ( delfosse et al . 1998 ) . with a nominal radius of 0.2 r@xmath5",
    ", this corresponds to a minimum period of 1.6 days , considerably longer than the total ( consecutive ) elapsed time of the hst exposures ( @xmath0 0.4 days ) .",
    "the individual exposures comprise @xmath6 2% of the minimum period , indicating negligible change in the location of a given active region during a single exposure .",
    "we do not see strong evidence for smooth ( non - flaring ) variability within a given orbit as was found by robinson et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in their near - ultraviolet photometric observations of yz cmi using hst with the high speed photometer instrument .",
    "our analysis of the stis spectrosopic data is not presently suitable for comparison with their flare frequency analysis , but it would be interesting to reanalyze the mama timetag data in sum over shorter time intervals to more rigorously identify individual flares . however , this is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "figure 1 and table 1 show that yz cmi was in an obvious flaring state for approximately 40% of the total 224 minutes of exposure time comprising the six separate exposures .",
    "the flux emitted in the near - ultraviolet bandpass sampled here ( 2300 - 3050 ) is approximately 4.2 @xmath7 ergs sec@xmath1 @xmath8 during quiet periods . using a distance of 6 parsecs for yz cmi ,",
    "the quiescent energy emitted from the visible hemisphere during the 224 minutes of exposure was @xmath9 ergs , while the energy emitted by flares was @xmath10 ergs , giving a total energy in this bandpass of @xmath11 ergs .",
    "the flare energy comprises @xmath0 8% of the total .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the spectrum summed over all quiet intervals .",
    "the line identifications were made using the chianti database ( dere et al .",
    "1997 , landi et al .",
    "clearly most of the emission lines in the near - uv come from fe ii , with the notable addition of the mg ii h and k lines and minor contributions from si ii , s ii and al ii .",
    "figure 3 shows the summed spectrum over all flare intervals , with the quiet spectrum subtracted .",
    "note that subtracting the quiet spectrum without scaling assumes that the area covered by the flare is negligible compared to the area of the visible hemisphere of the star .",
    "as discussed in section 3 , the flare area required to best match the observed mg ii k emission to the model predictions is @xmath0 0.5% of the observed surface , which supports the assumption that the flare area coverage is negligible .",
    "the flare - only emission shown in figure 3 is primarily evident in the mg ii and fe ii lines , which are enhanced by a similar amount ( @xmath0 10% ) over the quiet spectrum .",
    "significant broadening in the mg ii lines is also apparent in this flare - only spectrum , and is discussed further in section 2.2 below .",
    "table 3 gives the energy breakdown between lines and continuum for the flare intervals individually and in sum .",
    "the first column shows the excess flare line flux calculated from the subtracted spectrum ( flare interval - quiet ) , with the value in parentheses being the ratio of the flare line flux to the total ( line + continuum ) flux .",
    "the second column shows the same calculation for the continuum .",
    "thus the values in parentheses represent the relative importance of lines and continuum to the excess flare emission , and sum to 1 in each case .",
    "as typically seen in stellar flares ( e.g. hawley & pettersen 1991 ; hawley et al . 2003 ) the larger flares are dominated by the continuum contribution , e.g. f2a , f4 , f7 and f9a where @xmath0 70 - 90% of the energy is contained in the continuum .",
    "two of the flares ( f1 and f3 ) , actually showed negligible line enhancements ( formally negative but within the uncertainties of being small scale variability ) but well - detected continuum enhancements .",
    "a large m dwarf flare was recently observed with galex with a broad bandpass nuv filter ( robinson et al . 2005 ) , and analyzed assuming that all of the nuv emission was from the continuum .",
    "this appears to be reasonably justified by our analysis of the nuv flare spectra presented here .",
    "however , some smaller flares ( f5 , f8 ) , and the decay phases of large flares ( f2b , f2c , f9b ) , emit as much as 50% of their energy in the emission lines . in sum , the flaring intervals show that most flare energy is emitted in the continuum ( 77% compared to 23% in line emission ) , while the quiet spectrum is dominated by the emission lines , with 65% of the energy emitted in lines compared to 35% in the continuum .",
    "the nuv emission line energy is quite evenly divided between mg ii and fe ii in this bandpass , with the fe ii / mg ii energy ratio being 0.97 in the quiet spectrum , and 1.01 in the flare spectrum .",
    "each mg ii line carries much more energy than any individual fe ii line , but there are a large number ( 78 ) of identified fe ii lines in this region , which makes them energetically important in sum .",
    "our results for the quiet ratio are in agreement with those found in linsky et al .",
    "( 1982 ) .",
    "the mg ii lines undergo significant changes in their line profiles during the flaring intervals .",
    "figure 4 shows the mg ii k line profiles for the individual flares ( f1 - 10 ) , obtained from the summed spectra over the extent of each flaring episode .",
    "flares f2 and f9 were large enough that it was possible to split them up into impulsive , peak and decay phases , shown as f2abc and f9abc in figure 4 .",
    "the quiet flare profile is shown for comparison as the dotted line in each panel .",
    "it is clear that the quiet flux dominates the total even during flares , indicating that the flare area coverage is very small , and that mg ii k is already a very strong line even in the quiet chromosphere .",
    "this behavior is similar to h@xmath12 , which also responds only slightly to flares in early - mid m dwarfs ( e.g. hawley et al .",
    "2003 ) , though it responds more strongly in late m dwarfs ( cf .",
    "liebert et al .",
    "this is in contrast to lines such as he i and ii , and the higher order balmer lines , which become significantly stronger during flares , often dwarfing the quiet contribution to the line flux ( hawley & pettersen 1991 ) .",
    "figure 5 shows the subtracted profiles for each flare ( i.e. flare - quiet , as in figure 3 ) , in order to examine possible velocity shifts during the flare .",
    "the flares are shown on the same vertical scale such that strong flares have significant excess emission , and small flares have very little .",
    "it is clear that some flares ( f1 , f2 , f3 , f7 , f10 ) show a blue wing enhancement and red wing deficit , while others show the opposite behavior ( red wing enhancement and blue wing deficit - f4 , f9 ) and still others show both blue and red enhancements ( f5 , f8 ) or deficits ( f6 ) . for simplicity , we use only the mg ii k line in the following analysis , as the mg ii h line exhibited very similar behavior in all cases .",
    "the flares are grouped according to the appearance of the excess flare emission in figure 6 ( blue enhancements ) and figure 7 ( red enhancements ) , with the left panels showing mg ii k and the right panels the strong fe ii uv1 line at 2600.2 . in general ,",
    "the enhancements seen in mg ii k are also seen , albeit at a lower level and with poorer signal - to - noise ratio , in the fe ii data , as expected since these lines are formed in approximately the same temperature region of the atmosphere .",
    "simple gaussian fits to the enhancement features give wavelength shifts for each of these flares , as shown in table 4 .",
    "the shifts are not large , typically a few km / sec in both the upward ( blue shift ) and downward ( red shift ) directions .",
    "the sun also shows such velocity shifts even outside of obvious flares .",
    "these have been attributed to asymmetric heating in active region loops ( winebarger et al .",
    "2002 ) .    to verify that these apparent velocity shifts are not artifacts of the data reduction , we compared the magnitude and sense of the shift in each flare with the peculiar velocities of hst and the earth during the time period in the orbit that the flare occurred , and found no correlation .",
    "we see no evidence that the observed velocity shifts are instrumental in nature , and therefore presume that they represent real effects in the nuv emission lines emitted by the star .",
    "we discuss the velocities compared to those expected from our flare models in section 3 below .",
    "figure 8 shows the time evolution of the mg ii k emission for the largest flares , f2 and f9 .",
    "flare f2 exhibits rather simple behavior , with the narrow central profile strongly enhanced on the blue side in the impulsive phase ( f2a ) , and decreasing monotonically during the flare decay ( f2b , f2c ) . in contrast , flare f9 is quite unusual , initially ( f9a ) showing a strong red enhancement in the central profile , but then developing very broad , symmetric wings in f9b . upon closer inspection of figure 4",
    ", it appears that there is evidence for similarly broad wings in f7 and f9a .",
    "these data are reminiscent of those in doyle and byrne ( 1987 ) where extensive , symmetric line broadening was seen in the hydrogen balmer lines during a flare on yz cmi .",
    "broad hydrogen lines during flares are usually interpreted as being due to stark broadening ( donati - falchi et al .",
    "1985 , hawley and pettersen 1991 , johns - krull et al .",
    "1997 , jevremovic et al . 1998 ) but doyle and byrne were unable to find a satisfactory fit to the data with stark profiles .",
    "instead they inferred symmetric red and blue shifted emitting regions , or turbulent motions , of order a few hundred km sec@xmath1 .",
    "this is typical of the broad component often seen in transition region and coronal emission lines which is often ascribed to overlapping emission from multiple explosive microflaring events , leading to high velocity mass motions ( antonucci et al .",
    "1993 , wood et al .",
    "1996 , wood , linsky & ayres 1997 , vilhu et al .",
    "1998 ) . however , those broad components are not associated with large flares , but appear even in the quiescent spectra of active ( earlier - type ) stars , and the sun .",
    "the phenomenon we have observed appears to be directly related to the large flare heating event f9 , and does not appear in quiescence or in the other flaring events ( except possibly flare f7 ) . in particular it does not occur in the other large flare we observed , flare f2 .    in the present case",
    ", we do not expect that stark broadening will be important for the mg ii resonance lines .",
    "fleurier , sahal - brechot & chapelle ( 1977 ) determined experimentally that the stark broadening of these lines varied with core width between 0.05 - 0.10 , and wings extending to @xmath0 0.1 - 0.2 , for temperatures of @xmath13k and an electron density of @xmath14 @xmath15 , much higher than expected in the m dwarf atmosphere .",
    "figure 9 illustrates a simple gaussian fit to the underlying broad component in f9b yielding a redshift of 0.5  @xmath16 0.08  ( 53 @xmath16 8 km sec@xmath1 ) and fwhm of 2.36  @xmath16 0.58  ( 250 @xmath16 60 km sec@xmath1 ) .",
    "if interpreted as velocities , the fwhm would suggest turbulent emitting material with typical speeds @xmath17 100 km sec@xmath1 within a bulk condensation moving downward at roughly 50 km sec@xmath1 .",
    "both the bulk and turbulent velocities exceed the sound speed in the chromosphere , which is roughly 10 - 20 km sec@xmath1 . adopting a chromospheric mass density of @xmath18 g @xmath15 during the flare ( allred et al .",
    "2006 ) and a mg ii emitting region of height 300 km ( see figures 10 and 11 below ) along with a flare area of 0.5% of the visible stellar surface , the kinetic energy implied by chromospheric material moving at such large velocities far exceeds the energy radiated by the flare , by several orders of magnitude .    wood et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found that the mg ii h and k lines in hr 1099 , an active rs cvn binary system , showed a broad component during quiescence that looked similar to the broad components observed in the c iv transition region resonance lines , with fwhm @xmath0 170 km sec@xmath1 .",
    "they were skeptical , as we are , that the dense , optically thick chromosphere could respond to explosive microflaring events to drive mass motions at these velocities , and carried out detailed modelling that led them to suggest that opacity effects in the line wings might account for the observed broadening .",
    "again however , these effects were associated with the star in quiescence , not in the midst of an obvious strong flare .",
    "recently , allred et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) produced models of solar and stellar flares aimed at understanding the chromospheric and transition region emission .",
    "the models use solutions to the 1-d equations of radiative hydrodynamics , including non - lte radiative transfer in h , he and ca ii , with flare heating provided by an electron beam .",
    "the results include predictions of atmospheric structure ( temperature , density profiles ) , velocity and line profiles at many time steps during an episode of flare heating .",
    "we used the results of their preflare and f10 models to investigate the mg ii k emission during the yz cmi flares .",
    "the f10 model used here represents an average mid - flare atmosphere near a time step of @xmath0 85 sec ; see allred et al .",
    "note that the f10 model refers to electron beam heating of 10@xmath19 ergs sec@xmath1 @xmath8 during the model flare and is not to be confused with our observed f10 flare presented in section 2 above .    since the allred et al .",
    "models do not predict mg ii emission line profiles , the preflare and f10 models were further analyzed with the ` rh ' non - lte radiative transfer code described in uitenbroek ( 2001 ) .",
    "the rh code is based on the multi - level accelerated lambda ( mali ) formalism of rybicki & hummer ( 1991 , 1992 ) , which allows both bound - bound and bound - free radiative transitions to overlap in wavelength .",
    "it also includes the effects of partial redistribution for strong bound - bound transitions such as mg ii h and k.    figure 10 shows the temperature and density ( electron , hydrogen ) structure of the preflare atmosphere , together with the resulting mg ii k line profile and the contribution function .",
    "figure 11 is a similar plot for the model f10 flaring atmosphere .",
    "the contribution function indicates the atmospheric height where the observed emission of interest is produced .",
    "it is defined as the integrand in the equation for the emergent intensity : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the emergent intensity at frequency @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the cosine of the angle between the vertical and the emergent ray ( we show the results for @xmath23 = 1 , i.e. a ray that emerges vertically ) , @xmath24 is the source function , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the monochromatic opacity and optical depth respectively , and @xmath27 is the atmospheric height .",
    "as shown in the figures , the mg ii k line is formed in the upper chromosphere over a temperature range from 8000k ( line wings ) to 20,000k ( line core ) . at 20,000k",
    "the density is lower , hence there is relatively less emitting material .",
    "this lower emission in the line core causes the central reversal in the line profile ( see figure 10 ) . in the flaring atmosphere , there is an outward directed velocity where the core is formed , producing an asymmetric profile ( see figure 11 ) with a blue - shifted core .",
    "the contribution function ( center panel of figure 11 ) also indicates that the red wing is formed in a lower , denser region than the blue wing .",
    "therefore , more flux is produced in the red wing .",
    "we scaled the model flare line profile by 0.5% , subtracted it from the pre - flare line profile and smoothed it to the r=33,000 resolution of the data to produce the mg ii k subtracted ( flare - quiet ) model line profile shown in figure 12 .",
    "note that at this resolution , the prominent central reversals in the model profiles are much reduced , although the models still do not have the smooth appearance of the observed line profiles in figure 4 .",
    "nevertheless , the subtracted flare profile in figure 12 looks quite similar to the observed profile during the impulsive phase of flare f9 ( i.e. f9a , see figure 8) .",
    "the velocity shifts implied by the red - shifted emission are @xmath0 4 km sec@xmath1 in the model profile , and @xmath0 13.5 km sec@xmath1 in the observed profile",
    ".    however , the models do not reproduce the upward moving mg ii k material seen in the observed blue enhancement flares ( figure 6 ) , nor do they show the very broad component in the decay phase of flare f9 ( i.e. f9b , see figure 9 ) .",
    "in fact , if the broadening is interpreted as being due to emitting material moving with high velocity , the models never produce anything close to the velocities required at the depth of the mg ii emitting region .",
    "alternatively , the very broad wings seen in flare f9 may be due to enhanced redistribution of photons from the optically thick doppler core to the less thick radiative damping wings , due to some process associated with the flare .",
    "comparing quiet and flare profiles in figure 4 suggests that the line core is saturated , even in the quiet atmosphere , so redistribution is likely to be important .",
    "the allred et al .",
    "dynamical simulation includes the effects of the electron beam on atmospheric heating and the statistical equilibrium of h , but not mg .",
    "the rh code that we use to generate spectra from the allred et al .",
    "flare model includes a standard implementation of partial redistribution .",
    "a `` coherency fraction '' ( see uitenbroek 2001 , eqn . 13 ) mixes coherent scattering and complete redistribution in proportion to the depopulation rate ( due to radiation and inelastic collisions ) and elastic collision rate , respectively .",
    "typically , elastic collisions are due to van der waals and stark broadening .",
    "however , the rh code does not include the contribution to the elastic collision rate due to interactions with the electron beam .",
    "we speculate that the inclusion of the beam collisions would enhance the collisional rates , increasing the redistribution of line core photons into the wings and possibly producing the far wing line emission seen in the data .",
    "we plan to investigate this possibility in our next generation of flare models .",
    "we analyzed six orbits of hst / stis near - ultraviolet spectroscopic data on yz cmi and found that the star was flaring approximately 40% of the time .",
    "the flares contributed @xmath0 8% of the energy observed in the near - ultraviolet ( 2300 - 3050 ) during the 224 total minutes of exposure time .",
    "ten flaring and eight quiet intervals were identified , and two of the flares ( f2 , f9 ) were large enough to divide into sub - intervals to study the time evolution of the near - ultraviolet emission during those flares .",
    "the mg ii k emission line was examined in detail and found to change significantly between different flares , showing blue enhancements in some flares , red enhancements in others , and symmetric enhancements in the wings or core in still others .",
    "this indicates that mg ii emitting material may experience outward or inward directed velocities ( i.e. evaporation or condensation ) depending on the individual flare heating .",
    "the strongest fe ii line ( uv1 ) showed similar behavior to the mg ii k line .",
    "further , flare f9 showed a remarkable line broadening , which fit a gaussian profile corresponding to a velocity fwhm of @xmath0 250 km sec@xmath1 .",
    "this velocity is highly supersonic , and if the broadening is interpreted as due to either symmetric mass motions , or turbulence , implies a kinetic energy during the flare that vastly exceeds the radiated energy ( by several orders of magnitude ) .",
    "overlapping emission due to explosive microflares , as has been suggested to explain the broad components observed in optically thin transition region emission lines , does not appear to be a physically plausible explanation for the emission from the mg ii lines which are formed in a dense , optically thick regime .",
    "the data were compared to mg ii k line profiles generated using the preflare and f10 flare models of allred et al .",
    "( 2006 ) together with the rh code of uitenbroek ( 2001 ) .",
    "the model results indicate that the flare line profile has a red enhancement similar to that seen in the observed f9a spectrum , with velocity of a few km sec@xmath1 .",
    "however , the models do not predict the blue enhancements seen in some of the observed flares , nor does the mg ii emitting material attain velocities anywhere near those required to match the broad component of the mg ii k line seen in the f9b spectrum .",
    "the next step in the model calculations is to incorporate collisions with the electron beam into the mg ii k partial redistribution calculation , which may have the effect of increasing the emission in the radiative damping wings of the line , and could therefore explain the observed line broadening .",

    "<S> near - ultraviolet spectroscopic data obtained with the hst stis instrument on the dme flare star yz canis minoris ( yz cmi ) were analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> flare and quiet intervals were identified from the broadband near - uv light curve , and the spectrum of each flare was separately extracted . </S>",
    "<S> mg ii and fe ii line profiles show similar behavior during the flares . </S>",
    "<S> two large flares allowed time - resolved spectra to be analyzed , revealing a very broad component to the mg ii k line profile in at least one flare spectrum ( f9b ) . if interpreted as a velocity , this component requires chromospheric material to be moving with fwhm @xmath0 250 km sec@xmath1 , implying kinetic energy far in excess of the radiative energy . </S>",
    "<S> the mg ii k flare line profiles were compared to recent radiative hydrodynamic models of flare atmospheres undergoing electron beam heating . </S>",
    "<S> the models successfully predict red enhancements in the line profile with typical velocity of a few km sec@xmath1 , but do not reproduce the flares showing blue enhancements , or the strongly broadened line observed in flare f9b . </S>",
    "<S> a more complete calculation of redistribution into the line wings , including the effect of collisions with the electron beam , may resolve the origin of the excess line broadening . </S>"
