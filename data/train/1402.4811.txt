    "the presence of outflows in luminous quasars and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is most evident in broad absorption line ( bal ) systems @xcite .",
    "approximately 20% of quasars show bal features at some level ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , understood to be the result of an observational sightline through agn - driven wind material ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in a common model for bal quasars ( e.g. , *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the wind is launched from the accretion disk approximately 0.010.1 pc from the black hole and radiatively driven by ultraviolet ( uv ) line pressure . however , x - ray emission from typical quasars would over - ionize the gas , quenching the line - driving mechanism and thus preventing the appearance of bal features .",
    "therefore , this so - called `` disk - wind '' model requires that bal quasars have lower levels of x - ray emission , which could either be intrinsic or be due to shielding very close to the black hole , near the base of the wind .",
    "indeed , bal systems are very often observed to be x - ray faint ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though observations have yet to provide a clear picture of the origin of this x - ray faintness .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but there may be diversity among the population .",
    "following the terminology of other studies of x - ray emission in bal quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , the term `` x - ray weakness or faintness '' refers to the observed x - ray emission being significantly lower than expected given the optical - uv emission .",
    "this may be caused by a normal x - ray continuum modified by absorption from gas and dust .",
    "the term `` intrinsic x - ray weakness '' refers to an innate property of the agn , which is one possible cause of the observed x - ray faintness .    in order to investigate whether intrinsic x - ray weakness or shielding gas is the most likely explanation for the observed x - ray faintness of bal quasars , sensitive observations above 10  kev are highly desirable as they can distinguish between the presence of compton - thick ( @xmath6  @xmath1 ) shielding material and a less - obscured , intrinsically x - ray weak nucleus .",
    "the _ nuclear spectroscopic telescope array _ ( _ nustar _ ; @xcite ) is the first focusing high - energy x - ray telescope in orbit , and provides unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution for high - energy , or hard ( 379 kev ) x - ray photons .",
    "recently , _ nustar _ observed two of the optically brightest bal quasars known , pg  1004 + 130 and pg  1700 + 518 , with the goal of investigating the origin of their x - ray faintness @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , low count rates prevented a definitive answer , but they conclusively showed that any absorption present must be compton - thick . @xcite were also able to demonstrate that about 1740% of bal quasars are intrinsically x - ray weak by stacking _",
    "observations of @xmath7 bal quasars in the large bright quasar survey .",
    "confirmation of intrinsically x - ray weak agn in some bal quasars would have important consequences regarding the origin of bal features . instead of invoking shielding gas with an arbitrarily thick column density",
    ", intrinsic x - ray weakness would favor a scenario in which the bal features are coupled to abnormally faint coronal x - ray emission , perhaps due to some mechanism that ( periodically ) quenches the x - ray corona ( see   4.2 of @xcite for discussion ) . to this end",

    "this blind detection limit is above the peak bat signal of mrk  231 . given the prior knowledge of the source position , the detection limit can be reduced to 3@xmath40 because knowing the position of an astronomical source reduces the likelihood that the peak signal at that location is random noise @xcite . however , when the full bat band image is divided into eight sub - band images , the position of the bat peak changes from one band to another by several arcminutes , suggesting a likely spurious detection ( w. baumgartner , 2013 , private communication ) .",
    "the bat flux of mrk  231 , which is at least a factor of two lower than the _ bepposax _ and _ suzaku _ detections , suggests that part of the hard x - ray flux measured by _",
    "bepposax _ and _ suzaku _ has been resolved out by the smaller point spread function of bat or is variable .",
    "however , the bat detection has significant uncertainties which can be addressed by the _ nustar _ observations .",
    "the spectra from each epoch of _ nustar _ observations are well - fit by a single power law model modified by only galactic absorption and a narrow gaussian to represent the fe  k emission . for the first epoch , the best - fit @xmath41 ( @xmath42 for 68 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the observed 1530  kev flux is @xmath43  erg  s@xmath3  @xmath1 , approximately the value measured by @xcite despite their steeper assumed spectral slope .",
    "the ew of the fe  k emission line at @xmath46.5  kev is 0.29@xmath44  kev .",
    "the second epoch spectrum has a similar best - fit @xmath45 of @xmath46 ( @xmath47 for 63 degrees of freedom ) with an observed 1530  kev flux of @xmath48  erg  s@xmath3  @xmath1 .",
    "fe  k emission is insignificant in the second epoch which has poorer photon statistics due to the shorter exposure . although the two epochs of _ nustar _ data are separated by about seven months , there is no obvious sign of variability above 10  kev .",
    "therefore , to improve statistics , we created a combined spectrum of the two epochs of data using the `` addascaspec '' tool for each fpm .",
    "the summed spectrum is used for the remainder of this paper , and is best - fit by a power law model with @xmath49 ( @xmath50 for 108 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "this model implies a 1530  kev flux of @xmath51  erg  s@xmath3  @xmath1 .",
    "the derived 1530  kev observed flux from the _ nustar _ data are approximately a third to a half of the values measured by b04 and p13 ; the _ nustar _ spectrum is also significantly harder than those measured by b04 and p13 . comparing the _ nustar _ best - fit model to the _ bepposax _ pds and _ suzaku _ pin data , we find that the pds and pin detections are brighter and have steeper slopes ( figure  [ fig : contam ] ) .",
    "the pin data are only detected at @xmath45% above the total background .",
    "we were unable to check the accuracy of the `` tuned '' non - x - ray background provided by the _",
    "suzaku _ team since earth occulted observations are unavailable for these data . taking into account the @xmath43% systematic error of the `` tuned '' background ] , the lower limit of the pin data shows an even steeper slope than the nominal value .",
    "the change in spectral shape could be due to either contamination or variability .",
    "the latter is unlikely because of the lack of variability in our _ nustar _ epochs separated by seven months and the lack of intrinsic agn variability measured in historic x - ray data @xcite . unless the 1030  kev x - ray spectrum of mrk  231 hardened in the 14 months between the pin and the first set of _ nustar _ data , yet remained unchanged in the decade between the pds and pin observations ,",
    "we conclude that the previous detections are contaminated by field sources outside of the _ nustar _ fov .",
    "although not discussed in b04 or p13 , contamination from nearby sources can be problematic for detectors with limited angular resolution such as the pds or a large single - pixel fov such as the pin .",
    "the pds and pin data match in flux and spectral index ( figure  [ fig : contam ] ) , implying that if a contaminant exists for both sets of observations , then it must lie within the pin fov .",
    "taking advantage of the larger fov of _ xmm - newton _ epic - pn over that of _ chandra _ acis - s , we show the 17  ks 0.510  kev image of the mrk  231 field taken by _ xmm - newton _ in 2001 ( obsid : 0081340201 ) in figure  [ fig : contam ] .",
    "the field surrounding mrk  231 is richly populated with point sources .",
    "mrk  231 dominates the field in the 0.510  kev band , so it is reasonable to assume that it also dominates the field above 10  kev as other authors have done .",
    "it is unlikely that the source of contamination is a single object brighter than mrk  231 .",
    "however , with so many field sources , some may even be outside of the 27@xmath27 by 26@xmath27 _ xmm - newton _ fov ; it is likely that the integrated spectrum of multiple sources fainter than mrk  231 add to the pin and pds detections .",
    "a number of point sources detected by _ xmm - newton _ within the _ nustar _ fovs are weakly detected by _ nustar _ at 1020  kev ( see figure  [ fig : extract ] ) and there may be brighter sources outside the _ nustar _ fov contributing to the pin detection .    while we can not definitively rule out the possibility that the change in mrk  231 flux above 10  kev is due to intrinsic variability , we conclude that the _ bepposax _ and pin detections were probably due to contamination for the following reasons .    1",
    ".   the pin detection was at only 5.1% above the background between 1540  kev . at the 90% confidence level ,",
    "the reproducibility of the total pin background in this energy range is @xmath43%@xmath52 .",
    "therefore , about 5% of the time , the background is higher than that modeled , so the pin detection could be consistent with a non - detection . similarly , mrk  231 was detected by _",
    "pds at a rate of 0.066@xmath530.022 counts per second @xcite .",
    "the full band systematic error for pds is 0.020@xmath530.015 counts per second .",
    "thus , the pds detection is marginal and could also be consistent with a non - detection .",
    "2 .   using the hard band ( 2.58  kev ) @xmath54 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) derived from random fields from all over the sky and assuming a flux @xmath55 equal to the hard band flux of mrk  231 , there is a 33% chance a background source is of that flux or brighter within one deg@xmath56 ( fov of the pin ) .",
    "since the pin response falls off linearly with off - axis angle , to produce the assumed detected flux , it is most likely that the source has to be brighter than @xmath55 .",
    "conservatively , within the central 0.25 deg@xmath56 , the chances of contamination by a source of flux @xmath57 is better than 3% .",
    "because the pin s lack of imaging capability can not rule out serendipitous sources , we expect the chance of a source falling within the pin fov of one deg@xmath56 is better than 10% .",
    "this probability increases when we consider sources fainter than @xmath58 contaminating the field and detectors with larger fov such as that of _ bepposax_. the 2.58  kev @xmath54 may not match perfectly with the 1030  kev @xmath54 , but the only @xmath54 currently available above 10  kev is from the bat survey which only covers the brightest sources .",
    "as stated above , the _ nustar _ 1030  kev flux is consistent with the bat results integrated over nearly five years @xcite .",
    "since the temporal coverage is so long , we can assume that the bat value is the typical average flux of mrk 231 .",
    "the derived _ bepposax _ and pin fluxes are more than twice the bat limit .",
    "therefore , it would be a remarkable coincidence if the agn flared twice only at times observed by detectors with much larger psfs than _ nustar_. 4 .   if the agn flared when observed by _ bepposax _ and pin but not when observed by _",
    "nustar _ , the lack of variability below 10  kev or change in the fe line ew is puzzling @xcite .",
    "it would require a contrived scenario to have a compton - thick cloud present to obscure the hard x - ray continuum only when the 1030  kev flux is in the high state so that continuum variability is not detected below 10  kev or without change to the fe line ew .",
    "therefore , we conclude that contamination is the simplest explanation given all the circumstances .",
    "our _ chandra _ and _ nustar _ observations of mrk  231 comprise the most sensitive broadband x - ray spectrum of this object to date . in this section , we explore various models in order to constrain the three - dimensional geometry of the agn and its associated absorber system as well as the intrinsic luminosity of the agn . as stated previously , the _ nustar_-only spectra are well - fit by a single power law model . with the _ chandra _ data anchoring the lower energies",
    ", we modeled the full 0.530  kev spectrum ( @xmath59 for 261 degrees of freedom ) with a mekal gas temperature of 0.82@xmath530.04 kev and a very flat power law ( @xmath60 ) modified by a small column ( n@xmath61  @xmath1 ) . there is no telltale sign of a compton - reflection hump above 10  kev that would be indicative of significant reflection ; this is corroborated by the weak fe  k line ( ew@xmath40.30  kev ) . if mrk  231 were to contain a normal agn with a typical photon index ( e.g. , @xmath62 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the [ o iv ] , [ ne v ] and [ ne vi ] lines require sufficient high energy photons ( @xmath11477  ev ) to be produced .",
    "the weak continuum of mrk  231 becomes more evident if we compare it to another local ( @xmath115 ) agn ulirg , iras  f051892524 .",
    "both ulirgs are in the same merger stage @xcite , have approximately the same dynamically derived black hole masses @xcite , have nearly identical infrared seds @xcite , and have almost the same l@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "however , they have very different derived eddington ratios ( @xmath41 versus @xmath45 ) .",
    "given the uncertainties in the measured black hole masses and eddington ratios , this is only a qualitative comparison between mrk  231 and iras  f051892524 .",
    "the comparison is valid because the black hole masses were measured using the same method and thus have similar systemic measurement errors .",
    "iras  f051892524 has strong [ o iv ] , [ ne v ] , and [ ne vi ] emission lines and a strong intrinsic x - ray continuum @xcite while mrk  231 is the opposite .",
    "although we only have a limited sample , the distinction between these two sources may explain the large scatter of [ o iv]-to - bolometric luminosity relations observed in nearby agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the intrinsic x - ray weakness of mrk  231 is likely associated with the super - eddington accretion rate of the black hole that also drives its powerful outflows @xcite .",
    "we have obtained the most sensitive broadband ( 0.530  kev ) spectrum of mrk  231 , the closest bal quasar and an ulirg , to date .",
    "_ nustar _ detects mrk  231 at a fainter level above 10  kev than previous observations with poorer angular resolution by _ bepposax _ pds and _ suzaku _ pin .",
    "two epochs of _ nustar _ data separated by seven months show no evidence of hard x - ray variability so contamination is the likely cause of the discrepancy between _ nustar _ and previous , non - focusing hard x - ray observations .",
    "analysis of contemporaneous _",
    "chandra _ and _ nustar _ broadband spectra find significant x - ray emission from a powerful circumnuclear starburst .",
    "the direct agn emission is absorbed and scattered by a patchy torus that is compton - thin with n@xmath116  @xmath1 .",
    "the compton - thin absorption is compatible with the apparent weak fe  k emission ( ew@xmath40.2  kev ) .",
    "mrk  231 appears intrinsically x - ray weak .",
    "the absorption - corrected 210  kev luminosity is @xmath117% of the agn bolometric luminosity with @xmath5 .",
    "a reason for the low x - ray luminosity could be that the agn is in a rare ultra soft state similar to those seen in x - ray binaries , though this is inconsistent with the measured @xmath65 .",
    "it is unclear why the agn is intrinsically x - ray weak , but there are not very many known examples of such sources as points of comparison .",
    "the weak ionizing continuum explains the lack of mid - infrared [ o iv ] , [ ne v ] , and [ ne vi ] fine structure emission lines which are present in sources with otherwise similar agn properties .",
    "the intrinsic x - ray weakness may be a result of the super - eddington accretion occurring in the nucleus of the ulirg .",
    "these results on mrk  231 are consistent with its being a merger remnant emerging from its dusty cocoon through a powerful wind event .",
