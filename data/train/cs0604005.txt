    "@xmath30    the regions defined by these bounds , when regarded as images of maps that transform probability distributions into rate pairs , have a property that is a source of many difficulties : the mutual information expressions that define the inner and the outer bounds are identical , it is only the _ domains _ of the two maps that differ ; as such , comparing the resulting regions is difficult .",
    "this difference between the inner and outer bounds has been the state of affairs in multiterminal source coding , since 1978 .",
    "a close examination of these distributions suggested to us that the gap might not be due to a suboptimal coding strategy used in the inner bound , but instead that perhaps the outer bound allows for the inclusion of dependencies that can not be physically realized by any distributed code .",

    "[ fig : setup ] , based on what we believe is an original proof technique .",
    "some highlights of that proof method , formally developed in later sections , are provided here .",
    "our proof tightens existing converses by means of identifying a constraint that _ all _ codes are subject to , but that is not captured by any existing outer bound .",
    "to explain what the constraint is , the easiest way to get started is by drawing an analogy to classical , two - terminal rate - distortion codes .    in the standard ,",
    "two - terminal rate - distortion problem , a generic code consists of the following elements :    * a block length @xmath36 . * a cover @xmath37 of the source @xmath38 . * a reconstruction sequence @xmath39 , associated to each cover element @xmath40 .    given this description ,",

    "[ fig : covers - classical ] .    in an analogous manner ,",
    "we specify an arbitrary _ distributed _ rate - distortion code as follows :    * a block length @xmath36 . * _ two _ covers : * * a cover @xmath51 of the source @xmath38 . * * a cover @xmath52 of the source @xmath53 .",
    "+ indirectly , these two covers specify a cover @xmath54 of the product alphabet @xmath55 .",
    "* for each cover element @xmath56 , we specify _ two _ reconstruction sequences @xmath57 .    given this description , an encoder @xmath58 for node 1 makes @xmath59 for some source sequence @xmath43 and some index @xmath44 , if @xmath60 , with ties broken arbitrarily ( and similarly for an encoder @xmath61 at node 2 ) ; a decoder @xmath62 simply maps @xmath63 .",

    "[ fig : covers - distributed ] .",
    "our main insight is that , whereas in the classical problem any arbitrary cover defines a valid rate - distortion code , in multiterminal source coding this is no longer the case : _ covers of the product source @xmath67 only of the form @xmath68 can be realized by distributed codes_. the significance of this requirement is illustrated with an example in fig .",
    "[ fig : binary - example ] .    from the informal argument of fig .",
    "[ fig : binary - example ] , we see how the fact that distributed codes produce covers only of the form @xmath69 results in constraints on the sets used to cover the typical set @xmath70 : there are certain groups of typical sequences that can not be broken , in the sense that either all of them appear together in a cover element @xmath56 , or none of them appear .",
    "we believe this is significant for two main reasons :    * if we compare to a classical rate - distortion code , this constraint is clearly not there .",
    "provided the distortion constraints are met , a classical code would be able to split the typical set into distortion balls , without any further constraints .",
    "* more fundamentally though , we view this constraint as a form of `` independence , '' reminiscent to us of the extra independence assumption required by the long markov chain used in the definition of the berger - tung inner bound , which is not there in the definition of the outer bound , as highlighted in section  [ sec : difficulties ] earlier .",
    "this latter observation is perhaps the strongest piece of evidence that suggested to us that the berger - tung inner bound might be tight .",
    "the main contribution presented in part i of this paper is the development of an outer bound to the region of achievable rates for multiterminal source coding .",
    "this outer bound has two salient properties that distinguish it from existing bounds in the literature :    * it is based on explicitly modeling a constraint on the structure of codes that , as we understand things , had not been captured by any previously developed bound ; * and also unlike existing bounds , it is finitely parameterized .",
    "we believe that this outer bound coincides with the set of achievable rates defined by the berger - tung inner bound .",
    "this issue is thoroughly explored in part ii of this paper , in the context of our study of algorithmic issues involved in the effective computation of this bound .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] we define our notation , and state our main result . in section  [ sec : aux - lemmas ] we state and prove some auxiliary lemmas that greatly simplify the proof of the main theorem , a proof that is fully developed in section  [ sec : main - proof ] .",
