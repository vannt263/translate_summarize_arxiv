    "the quantum mechanics of particles confined to surfaces or surface layers embedded in a higher dimensional space , e.g. curves , tubular structures around curves , surfaces or layers between two surfaces in three dimensions , has attracted attention from many authors in the past three decades .",
    "recently there has been considerable progress in rigorously , and non - perturbatively analyzing the changes to the spectrum of the laplacian in curved geometries in two dimensions - these have been motivated by applications in mesoscopic semi - conductor physics , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there are also studies of the contribution of torsion to the bound state energies , @xcite , @xcite . until now the results for higher dimensional confinement",
    "are restricted to the perturbative regime , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "below we summarize the main results of these studies , as they relate to the application of interest here .",
    "the next section reviews the relation between quantum mechanics and polymer physics in some detail .",
    "we compute the free energy in the geometries of interest in the third section .",
    "most of the details of these calculations are left to an appendix .",
    "the final section computes the effective bending rigidities of a dilute polymer solution confined in a box with elastic walls , and includes our concluding remarks .",
    "the correct quantization procedure for quantum particles confined to manifolds embedded in higher dimensional spaces turns out to be non - trivial , @xcite .",
    "studies , @xcite - @xcite , which are perturbative in the curvature of the manifold , conclude that confinement to a curved manifold results in an effective potential , which depends _ both _ on the manifold to which the particle is confined _ and _ the particular way this manifold is embedded in the higher dimensional space , i.e. _ both _ on the intrinsic _ and _ extrinsic curvatures of the manifold .",
    "this dependence on the extrinsic curvature means that one can not arrive at the correct schrdinger s equation by just transforming the laplacian to the coordinates of the confining manifold ; this can be understood in the light of the uncertainty principle - the particle will know that there is an `` outside '' , no matter how strongly it is confined .",
    "confinement to a curve in three dimensions generates a potential , which is attractive to the most highly curved regions , in the one dimensional schrdinger s equation ; this potential is proportional to the square of the local curvature of the curve , @xcite .",
    "if one considers a ` thin - tube ' that is wound around a curve and has constant cross - section , ( see fig.1 ) , to lowest order in the curvature one finds the same result : the energy change is proportional to the square of the curvature of the curve that the tube follows .",
    "the proportionality constant is independent of the shape of the cross - section , and also of the exact details of the confining potential ( hard - walls etc . ) , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite - this can be easily understood by dimensional analysis , scaling arguments and using the result of @xcite .",
    "confinement between two _ equidistant _ surfaces in general dimension results in a potential @xmath2 , which ( in the appropriate units , i.e. neglecting overall positive constants ) is given to second order in the principal radii of curvatures @xmath3 , ( ) , by @xcite :    @xmath4    for a spherical shell embedded in @xmath5 dimensions one sets , for all @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the radius of the shell , and , as first written down in @xcite , eq.([potential ] ) reduces to .",
    "this is negative for @xmath8 .",
    "of course , all of the above results apply to any physical system that contains the laplacian in its equations of motion .",
    "the particle - in - a - box problem of quantum mechanics is closely related to confined ideal polymers .",
    "a flexible polymer in solution is a random walk . in the case without excluded volume interactions this will be denoted as an ` ideal chain ' ; i.e. ideal chains are allowed to self - intersect without raising their energy .",
    "an ideal polymer chain configuration may be mapped onto the motion of a quantum particle , where the probability distribution function is the analogue of the wave function , and the degree of polymerization ( n ) plays the role of imaginary time@xcite . in this spirit",
    "we reduce the ` ideal - chain - in - a - box ' problem to a quantum ` particle - in - a - box ' problem .",
    "we consider a random walk in space , and work in the continuum description .",
    "let @xmath9 be the probability for a walk of @xmath10 steps to have its ends at @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the function @xmath13 is defined to be @xmath14 for @xmath15 , and it satisfies @xcite the differential equation :    @xmath16    here @xmath17 is the monomer length .",
    "( [ diffuse ] ) describes diffusion once the boundary conditions are specified",
    ". we may also think about it as schrdinger s equation , where @xmath10 plays the role of imaginary time .",
    "the partition function is just a sum over all configurations :    @xmath18    the factor of @xmath19 keeps the volume fixed when the free energy is computed .    here",
    "we comment on the exact problem that we are considering , and our choice of boundary conditions , when we compare the flat and curved boxes .",
    "our main aim is to find out the effects of polymer confinement on the bending elasticities of the confining structure .",
    "hence we would like to isolate the change in the free energy due to curvature _ only_. therefore we pick periodic boundary conditions in the transverse directions of the flat box .",
    "also to the same end we conserve the volume of the box during bending ; this , of course , will fix the radius of the curved box once the amount of material ( the surface area of the flat box ) is fixed . assuming that the free energy per unit area for this system can be expanded in the curvature when this radius is large compared to the thickness of the box",
    ", one can compute the coefficients in this expansion to second order in the curvature .",
    "there are in general two bending elasticities to compute .",
    "these can be uniquely determined from the two equations one attains by considering the free energy of the sphere and the cylinder .",
    "we have in mind membranes which generally do not have free edges but end at the walls of a container , or are closed vesicles .",
    "then , e.g. for a container with repulsive walls , one has to take into account when computing the energy balance the fact that the eigenfunctions for the flat box vanish at the transverse edges .",
    "also , the volume for the real system may _ not _ be conserved - this would bring translational entropy pieces into the energy balance in addition to the contributions we calculate in the present work .    to compute the partition function",
    "we use the method of eigenfunctions and levels of the schrdinger s equation .",
    "this is an ` effective hamiltonian ' method where one integrates out certain configurations of the polymer chain and labels the coarse - grained modes by discrete ` levels ' .",
    "thus we write @xmath20 , where the sum is over the levels and @xmath21 are the eigenvalues of the effective hamiltonian that describes the system in terms of these levels only . for the remainder of this paper , in order to simplify the notation , we measure all energies in the units of @xmath22 , and all lengths in the units of @xmath23 , ( except in the final results ) .",
    "it becomes clear what these levels are once one employs the eigenfunction expansion @xcite for the propagator of the chain : . here",
    "@xmath24 is the step function assuring that @xmath25 for @xmath15 , and the @xmath26 s are normalized solutions to .",
    "it is easy to verify that this expansion indeed solves eq.([diffuse ] ) , ( recall : .",
    "the boundary conditions are at the walls which are at @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this is a slab of thickness @xmath29 in one dimension , and a spherical shell of radius @xmath7 and thickness @xmath29 in any dimension @xmath5 .    using this eigenfunction expansion in the partition function expression , eq.([partition1 ] )",
    ", we find :    @xmath30    we see that in the geometry of interest all states except the spherically symmetric ones disappear from the sum in eq .",
    "( [ part ] ) , even though they do contribute to the propagator .",
    "( in @xmath31 , the sinusoidal solutions with an even number of peaks disappear ) . hence :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 labels the distinct s - wave levels , @xmath34 is the normalized radial wavefunction , and we explicitly indicate the dependence of the energies on @xmath7 and @xmath29 . defining :",
    "@xmath35    where @xmath36 is the surface area of the unit sphere in @xmath5 dimensions , we can write for the free energy :    @xmath37    where m is the number of chains ( each containing n links ) in the box .",
    "we now proceed with the analysis of the above expression .",
    "we consider a spherical annulus of large radius and small thickness in arbitrary dimension d. the walls are taken to be repulsive for the polymer .",
    "physical interest lies in @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , which is a cylindrical shell in three dimensions , and @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "3 ) , a spherical shell in three dimensions .",
    "the laplacian in d - dimensions is @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 is the angular momentum operator in @xmath5 dimensions . after standard manipulations we find the following quantization condition in terms of dimensionless variables :    @xmath41   n_\\xi \\left[({\\tilde{e}})^{\\frac{1}{2 } }",

    "@xmath46 symmetric casimir operator , and the functions @xmath47 and @xmath10 are the standard bessel functions .",
    "as explained earlier , spherical symmetry of the geometries considered causes all but the @xmath48 states to drop out of the partition function . defining @xmath49 , ( for @xmath50 ) , @xmath51 , and labelling these s - wave states by @xmath52 , one can now proceed with a perturbative analysis by expanding eq.([eigen ] ) in powers of @xmath53 , which results in : @xmath54 .",
    "\\label{epert}\\ ] ] this is the same perturbative result cited above .",
    "we see that the curvature lowers the spherically symmetric energy spectrum for @xmath55 , does not affect it when @xmath31 ( trivial ) , or @xmath1 , and increases it everywhere else . notice that the perturbation series stops for @xmath31 , and @xmath1 . also notice that the perturbative effect is the same for all modes up to fourth order",
    ", this simplifies treating the full free energy of the polymer , eq.([free ] ) .",
    "this treatment an expression for @xmath56 , the computation of which is difficult in general , but we were able to find an exact expression in @xmath1 , and a perturbative one in @xmath38 .",
    "we now summarize our results .",
    "details are left to the appendix .      defining @xmath57 as the partition function of the flat box , and @xmath58 we find the exact result for the partition function :",
    "@xmath59    where the functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 are defined in the appendix . one can expand the above expressions in two limits : when the typical polymer dimension , @xmath62 , is smaller or larger than the box width , @xmath29 .",
    "the latter is the so - called ground state dominance regime ( g.s.d . ) - here @xmath63 ; the former we will denote by `` the colloid limit '' ( c.l . ) , since in this limit the coils look like small balls - here @xmath64 . in g.s.d .",
    ", the corrections due to @xmath65 are negligible , and we find that the free energy does not have any corrections due to curvature . in c.l .",
    "we find : + @xmath66      in this case we find ( to lowest order in @xmath67 ) :    @xmath68    where @xmath60 is the same function as for three dimensions , and @xmath69 is defined in the appendix .",
    "this , in g.s.d . leads to : + @xmath70 .",
    "there are no terms of order @xmath71 , and two terms of order @xmath72 which cancel each other exactly , and the expansion starts at third order , ( this is similar to what happens for small hard spheres , i.e. colloids , - there one finds that there is no shift in the free energy in two dimensions , and a positive shift in three dimensions , @xcite ) : + @xmath73 + in the strong confinement ( g.s.d . ) regime it does not matter to which chain the monomers belong - the shift in the energy is proportional to the total number of monomers , @xmath74 ; in the c.l .",
    "regime we have an ideal gas of @xmath75 objects .",
    "we comment on some issues before computing effective bending rigidities using the above results : in the non - perturbative regime we solved the eigenvalue equation , eq .",
    "( [ eigen ] ) , numerically for the ground states in @xmath76 and 5 , for @xmath77 .",
    "the large @xmath78 behavior of the solutions , ( see the curves plotted in fig .  4 ) , are exactly as predicted by eq .",
    "( [ epert ] ) .",
    "notice that they are all converging to the flat case value of @xmath79 for very small curvature . as the curvature increases the behavior changes its functional form , and becomes much sharper than just a quadratic deviation .",
    "one can follow these curves farther towards infinite curvature , and see that they tend to a constant value that depends on the dimensionality .",
    "this pattern is also valid for @xmath80 , @xmath48 ( s - wave ) , states .    for surfaces in three dimensions eq.([potential ] )",
    "reduces to : .",
    "the effect of this potential , even after integration over the entire surface , is always attractive except for in two cases where it has no effect at all , the flat surface , and the sphere .",
    "notice also that in one always gets an attractive potential if the confining curves are not perfectly flat .",
    "thus in two dimensions , -(physically we think about generalized cylinders living in three dimensions ) , the free energy is reduced by any curvature , regardless of the shape of the boundaries .",
    "although we are not considering large curvatures here , it is worthwhile to mention that the literature cited in the introduction proves that in one and two dimensional structures , ( tubes and strips ) , the ground state energy of the laplace operator decreases due to curvature , and there is a bound state localized in the regions of curvature .",
    "this is a non - perturbative statement , and it makes very weak assumptions about the detailed geometry .",
    "this is important because it implies that in these systems , ( at least in g.s.d . )",
    ", the polymer would localize in regions where there is curvature .",
    "one explicit example of this is the numerical solution of schrdinger s equation in oval shaped rings @xcite .",
    "we conclude by calculating the contribution of this effect to the effective bending curvature elasticity of an ideal polymer confined to a fluid bilayer membrane .",
    "let @xmath83 be the curvature free energy per area .",
    "up to quadratic order in the principal radii @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath83 can be written in terms of the mean and gaussian curvatures of the surface . in terms of the principal radii , the mean curvature is , and",
    "the gaussian curvature is . a general form of @xmath83 to this order",
    "is given by @xcite : , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are constants usually denoted by ` bending rigidities ' .",
    "the spontaneous curvature of the surface , @xmath86 , is taken as zero for the rest of this discussion , because the film is assumed symmetric with respect to its mid - plane .    to find out the effects of polymer confinement on @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , we first consider a vesicle ( a spherical shell in @xmath87 ) , with a small curvature , i.e. a shell of radius @xmath7 , with a finite thickness @xmath29 , where @xmath88 .",
    "for a sphere both principal radii are equal to @xmath7 , and we find .",
    "next consider a cylindrical shell @xmath89 ; now @xmath90 , but @xmath91 .",
    "thus , . defining , @xmath92 being the surface area , and using the results for @xmath93 for the sphere and the cylinder we conclude that :    @xmath94    @xmath95    where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the changes in the bending rigidities . these expressions can be expanded in g.s.d . and c.l .",
    ", to give :    @xmath98    @xmath99    we have not considered any interactions between monomers .",
    "we expect that interactions between chains in a dense solution would screen out the effect of the walls on the concentration profile over a very short distance and hence weaken this curvature effect .",
    "we are currently studying this situation .",
    "but our results may hold qualitatively for concentrations below the overlap concentration , @xmath100 . to be consistent with our analysis we use gaussian exponents to estimate @xmath100 : in g.s.d .",
    "we require @xmath101 .",
    "thus @xmath102 . in c.l .",
    "the walks are three dimensional and we require @xmath103 .",
    "thus @xmath104 .",
    "this leads to :    @xmath105    @xmath106    edwards theory assumes slow variations of the propagator @xcite , and is therefore valid over large length scales compared to the lattice spacing , @xmath17 , and moderately large number of steps , @xmath10 .",
    "( aside : we also need @xmath107 , in order to use our perturbative result ) .",
    "notice that for @xmath64 we have @xmath108 - which can be achieved e.g. with @xmath109 , and @xmath110 , then this term gives a factor of @xmath111 .",
    "estimating the bare rigidities of the box to be of the order of @xmath112 , we see that the effect is about @xmath113 % for @xmath81 , and @xmath114 % for @xmath82 .",
    "we emphasize that the major result of this article is that polymer confinement might reduce @xmath81 , and thereby induce spontaneous curvature in the system , such as transitions from lamellar to bicontinuous phases or tubules etc , provided that the effect persists after the inclusion of self - avoidance , i.e. monomer - monomer interactions , in the analysis .",
    "we expect that this would be the case below the overlap threshold , but future work should address this issue in detail .",
    "we note here that , since there are two length scales in the problem , one can not solve the self - avoiding walk problem by simple scaling arguments .",
    "after one understands the role of interactions , one should also consider the case of a polymer with a finite persistence length .",
    "we expect that in the regime where the radius of curvature is much larger than the persistence length the result would approach the one for the totally flexible polymer case we treated in the present article ( modulo interactions ) .",
    "but when the two lengths are comparable , the aversity to bending of rigid polymers should modify the effect computed here .",
    "note added in proof : as we were preparing to publish we received a preprint by e. eisenriegler , a. hanke , and s. dietrich , in which the authors also compute bending rigidities of systems with chains near a repulsive surface .",

    "this allows an expansion of @xmath60 :          in two dimensions the integrals are also exactly doable but the final expression for @xmath65 is now much more complicated - we do not bother including this here .",
    "it can , however , be expanded in @xmath67 , to yield :      now , when one is not in g.s.d .",
