    "thus the author of the present paper does not feel obliged to cite the very large amount of important references .",
    "in addition , one must mention the excellent book by dorogovtsev and mendes @xcite , which gives a very interesting summary of the actual problems of the growth and structure of random networks .",
    "it has been long known that the random evolution of a tree   corresponds to a galton - watson process @xcite which describes the formation of a population which starts at @xmath0 with one individual and in which at discrete time moments @xmath8 each individual produces a random number of offspring with the same distribution independently of the others .",
    "there are many interesting papers on this subject , statements of which are analyzed and generalized in ref .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the random tree evolution with continuous time parameter with the hope that this may help to a better understanding of the nature of the age - dependent branching processes which play a significant role in many fields of physical and biological sciences @xcite .",
    "the general theory of age - dependent branching processes is excellently summarized in ref .",

    "@xcite , therefore we decided to focus only on the correlation and survival properties of the randomly evolving trees .",

    "the number @xmath4 of the offspring is a random variable , and the probabilities @xmath13 are assumed to be known .",
    "the new living nodes are promptly connected to the dead one and each of them can evolve further like a root independently of the others .",
    "this means that the tree from its initial state @xmath11 may evolve further by two mutually exclusive ways , in which the root either    * survives , and thus the tree remains in its initial state during the whole time interval @xmath14 , or * the root does die in an infinitesimally small subinterval @xmath15 and produces @xmath16 new living nodes .",

    "<S> instant @xmath1 , the root produces @xmath2 living nodes connected by lines to the root which becomes dead at the moment of the offspring production . in the evolution process </S>",
    "<S> each of the new living nodes evolves further like a root independently of the others . by using the methods of the age - dependent branching processes </S>",
    "<S> we derive the joint distribution function of the numbers of living and dead nodes , and determine the correlation between these node numbers as a function of time . </S>",
    "<S> it is proved that the correlation function converges to @xmath3 independently of the distributions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 when @xmath6 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> also analyzed are the stochastic properties of the end - nodes ; and the correlation between the numbers of living and dead end - nodes is shown to change its character suddenly at the very beginning of the evolution process . the survival probability of random trees is investigated and expressions are derived for this probability . </S>"
