    "in the past few years we have seen the fruition of a great astronomical endevour : the measurement of the rate of cosmological evolution via direct censuses of star formation tracers , metal content , and metal production rate ( lilly et  al .",
    "1995 ; pei &  fall 1995 ; lilly et  al.1996 ; madau et  al .  1996 ; connolly et  al .  1997 ; madau , pozzetti , & dickinson 1998 ) .",
    "this achievement has come about thanks to several key developments including ( 1 ) deep sub - arcsecond imaging capabilities , especially in the optical with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( williams et  al .",
    "1996 ) , ( 2 ) multi - object spectroscopy , especially down to @xmath13 abmag with the 10 m keck telescopes ( e.g.  steidel et  al.1996a , b ; lowenthal et  al .",
    "1997 ) , and ( 3 ) the refinement of photometric redshift techniques ( e.g.  connolly et  al . , 1997 ) especially the lyman - limit technique ( e.g. steidel &  hamilton 1992 ; steidel , pettini , &  hamilton 1995 ) which allow redshift estimates to be made to greater depth , and out to @xmath14 .    in a pioneering paper madau et  al .",
    "( 1996 ; hereafter m96 ) derived the @xmath15 evolution of the metal production rate  ( in comoving coordinates ) , which is directly proportional to the volume density of the star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "the `` madau plot '' provides a direct constraint on the evolution of galaxies , hence it s importance .",
    "it shows a strong ( factor @xmath16 10 ) decline in  from its peak at @xmath17 to the present epoch , as pointed out earlier by lilly et  al .",
    "this decline mirrors that seen in the luminosity density of quasars ( boyle &  terlevich 1997 ) . on the other side of the peak , at @xmath18 ,",
    "is apparently only equal to that of the present epoch .",
    "subsequent work by connolly et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) fills in the @xmath19 gap and is consistent with m96 .",
    "the overall shape of the curve is consistent with models of the observed evolution in the properties of damped lyman-@xmath20 systems ( pei &  fall , 1995 ) .",
    "this form for  is consistent with hierarchical models of galaxy formation ( e.g.  searle &  zinn , 1978 ; zepf &  ashman , 1993 ; baugh et  al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "one concern about the madau plot is that it is heavily biased to observations in the rest frame uv .",
    "the problem is that dust efficiently scatters and absorbs uv radiation , greatly complicating the interpretation of the detected uv emission .",
    "not only is the amount of dust important , but so is the geometry ( where it is relative to the stars ) , and the composition of the dust .",
    "for example , in the local group the uv `` extinction law '' varies from galaxy to galaxy and within galaxies , ( e.g.  fitzpatrick 1986 ) .",
    "the term `` extinction law '' was originally defined for stars .",
    "it quantifies the wavelength dependent combined effect of dust absorption and scattering out of the line of sight toward point sources .",
    "the geometry is quite different in distant galaxies where individual stars can not be isolated , and instead galaxies in their entirety , or large portions of them are observed . in such cases",
    "much of the scattered light may be recovered ( by scattering into the line of sight ) , and it matters a great deal how porous the dust distribution is and whether the stars are mixed with the dust or not ( e.g.  witt , thronson , &  capuano 1992 ; calzetti , kinney & storchi - bergmann 1994 ) .",
    "there are a variety of terms for the wavelength dependent net dimming of the light including `` effective extinction law '' ( calzetti et  al .",
    "1994 ) and `` obscuration law '' ( calzetti 1997 ) . here",
    "we adopt the term `` absorption law '' to emphasize that it is dust absorbing photons that causes the dimming .",
    "absorption laws can be derived empirically ( e.g.  calzetti et  al .",
    "1994 ; calzetti 1997 ) and hence average together all the above geometric factors into a simple wavelength dependent correction .",
    "observations of high redshift galaxies in the sub - mm and mm bands prove that molecular gas and dust formation have occurred as far back as @xmath21 ( omont et  al .",
    "1996 ; ivison et  al .  1998 ; guilloteau et  al .",
    "1997 ; frayer et  al .",
    "especially interesting are the recent spate of blank field sub - mm detection with scuba , which we discuss in more detail in  [ ss : rc ] and  [ ss : scuba ] . these can account for a significant fraction of the sub - mm background , and are mostly attributed to dusty star forming galaxies having @xmath22 . following from uv observations of local starbursts ( meurer et  al .",
    "1995 , hereafter paper i ) we have argued that the correction factor to  is considerable , a factor @xmath23 at @xmath1 ( meurer et  al .",
    ", 1997 ; hereafter paper ii ) , while others ( e.g.  madau 1997 ; pettini et  al.1997 ) prefer fairly modest , @xmath16 factor of three , corrections .",
    "the amount of high-@xmath15 absorption has a direct bearing on the interpretation of the madau plot ; large corrections at high-@xmath15 can push back the peak @xmath24 , as might be expected by monolithic collapse dominated galaxy formation ( e.g. eggen , lynden - bell , &  sandage 1962 ; bower , lucey &  ellis 1992 ; ortolani et  al .",
    "1995 ) .    here",
    "we reexamine the uv luminosity density at high-@xmath15 , with particular emphasis on the @xmath0-dropouts in the hdf .",
    "our technique has two strengths .",
    "firstly , it is based on the similarity between local starburst galaxies and lyman limit systems as summarized in   [ s : comp ] .",
    "the main assumption we make is that the high redshift galaxies have the same multi - wavelength spectral properties as local starbursts .",
    "we use local starburst galaxies to calibrate the relationship between uv reddening and uv absorption ( in   [ s : cal ] ) thus largely avoiding the uncertainties in population model fitting and the choice of effective uv absorption laws .",
    "secondly , our calibration of the uv absorption law recovers the intrinsic ( i.e. dust - free ) uv emission that is absorbed by dust and reradiated in the far infrared .",
    "hence , up to the modest amounts of absorption considered here ( a few magnitudes ) , uv observations are capable of recovering the total bolometric luminosity of starbursts .",
    "we apply our calibrations to the @xmath0-dropouts in the hdf in   [ s : appl ] . in   [ s : test ] we demonstrate the validity of our starburst assumption by showing that new constraints on the seds of these high-@xmath15 systems are consistent with the seds of local uv selected starbursts .",
    "implications of our results are discussed in  [ s : disc ] , while   [",
    "s : sum ] summarizes the paper .    throughout this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath25 , @xmath9 .",
    "progress in understanding the lyman - dropout galaxies would be accelerated if we could find analogs to these galaxies in the local universe .",
    "fortunately , there is mounting evidence that the lyman dropout galaxies indeed resemble starburst galaxies in many respects .",
    "while the magnitude of the extinction corrections to the rest - frame uv light ( the subject of the present paper ) is still a matter of debate , it is nevertheless clear that local starbursts have surface - brightnesses that are similar to the distant galaxies ( paper ii ) .",
    "that is , the high - z galaxies appear to be ` scaled - up ' versions of the local starbursts with the same sfrs per unit area and comparable stellar surface - mass - densities . in this regard , starbursts are a far better match to the lyman - dropout galaxies than are ordinary late - type galaxies , which have sfrs per unit area that are several orders - of - magnitude smaller ( cf .",
    "paper ii ; kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "the overall rest - frame uv - through - optical spectral properties of local starbursts and the lyman dropout galaxies are similar in terms of the spectral energy distribution ( cf .",
    "sawicki & yee 1998 ) and the dominance of the uv and optical spectra by absorption and emission lines respectively ( cf .  leitherer 1997 ; pettini et  al .",
    "the lyman limit systems in the hdf are clearly spatially resolved ( giavalisco , steidel , &  macchetto 1996 ) , demonstrating that their rest frame uv light is not dominated by an agn .",
    "in addition the spectra of the lyman - dropout galaxies is more similar to starburst galaxies than agn . indeed",
    "the typical strengths of the uv stellar and interstellar absorption - line features are comparable in starbursts and lyman - dropout galaxies , indicative of broadly similar stellar and interstellar content ( e.g. conti , leitherer , &  vacca 1996 ; lowenthal et  al .",
    "1997 ) . the local starbursts and",
    "lyman dropout galaxies also have similar distributions of observed uv colors , ( paper ii , and here in ",
    "[ s : appl ] ) , - which we argue chiefly measures the amount of dust - reddening .",
    "even the dynamical state of the interstellar medium in the lyman dropout galaxies resembles that in local starbursts . both are driving extensive outflows of gas at velocities of several hundred km s@xmath26 .",
    "the signature of this is the systematic blueshift of the broad uv interstellar absorption - lines with respect to the rest - frame optical ( e.g. h@xmath2 ) and/or rest - frame uv ( ly@xmath20 ) nebular emission - lines ( pettini et  al .",
    "1998 ; franx et  al .  1997",
    "; kunth et  al .  1998 ; gonzalez - delgado et  al .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the emission - line gas is also similar in the two galaxy classes ( pettini et  al .",
    "1998 ) .    to reiterate , in all their properties measured to - date , the lyman dropout galaxies appear to be simply scaled - up versions of local starbursts : larger and more luminous , but otherwise remarkably similar .",
    "the challenge is to determine the intrinsic luminosities from the uv fluxes and colors of dusty lyman limit systems .",
    "the above similarities justifies our approach of calibrating the effects of dust on local starbursts and applying it to the high-@xmath15 galaxies .",
    "figure  [ f : uvir ] illustrates the heart of the technique .",
    "it shows the relationship between the ratio of far infrared ( fir ) and ultraviolet ( uv ) fluxes ( here at 1600 ) and the uv spectral slope @xmath2 ( equivalent to a color ) for a sample of starburst galaxies .",
    "since the fir flux is due to dust radiatively heated by the absorbed uv radiation , the @xmath27 axis is a measurement of dust absorption .",
    "this figure then shows that dust absorption is correlated with uv reddening .",
    "such a relationship is expected for dust predominantly located in a foreground screen ( witt et  al .",
    "1992 ; paper i ) , although this screen need not be homogeneous ( calzetti et  al .  1994",
    "; calzetti 1997 ) . because this correlation links @xmath28 to uv quantities , then regardless of the exact dust geometry , this figure provides a powerful _ empirical _",
    "tool for recovering the radiation reprocessed by dust and thus determining the total absorption - corrected uv flux of starbursts , using uv quantities alone .    in the next sub - section",
    "we define our local calibrating samples and the quatities we use . in order to apply this tool and interpret the results we perform three calibrations",
    ". 1 .  is calibrated in terms of absorption at 1600  and this is fitted as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "2.the spectroscopic index @xmath2 is calibrated in terms of broad - band colors ( with a @xmath15 correction ) , since photometric colors are easier to measure than spectroscopic ones .",
    "the relationship between luminosity measured at 1600  is related to sfr .",
    "these calibrations are detailed in the final three sub - sections .",
    "the local sample used to derive the various calibrations in this paper is listed in table  [ t : loc ] .",
    "it includes the sources shown in fig .",
    "[ f : uvir ] , and is drawn from the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( iue ) atlas of kinney et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) , and contains galaxies having an `` activity class '' consistent with being a starburst , i.e.  sb nuc .",
    "( starburst nucleus ) , sb ring ( starburst ring ) , bcdg ( blue compact dwarf galaxy ) , or bcg ( blue compact galaxy ) .",
    "although the uv sources in these galaxies tend to be centrally concentrated we find that galaxies with optical diameters @xmath29 ( @xmath30 is measured at @xmath31 mag arcsec@xmath32 ) tend to fall above the relationship shown in fig .",
    "[ f : uvir ] .",
    "this is probably because significant uv emission extends beyond the @xmath33 iue aperture .",
    "hence these large galaxies were excluded from the sample . further limiting the sample to galaxies having @xmath34",
    "removes a few more outliers , but not just galaxies above the relationship .",
    "furthermore , it also severely depletes the points with @xmath35 .",
    "applying fits to data limited in this way changes our final @xmath36 results by @xmath37% , hence we retain @xmath38 as the diameter limit for the local sample .",
    "the lack of systematic residuals for galaxies up to 12 times larger than the iue aperture indicates that the uv emission of these galaxies is very compact , e.g.in a circum - nuclear starburst .",

    "the 1600  dust absorption factor , @xmath333 ( equivalent to @xmath339 mag ) , derived here for the @xmath0-dropouts is lower than our original estimate of a factor of 15 ( paper ii ) , albeit within the factor of three uncertainty we originally estimated .",

    "this suggests that the most luminous starbursts at @xmath407 are less dust enshrouded than those seen locally - the ultra - luminous infrared galaxies . however , this conjecture is difficult to test , since there are very few uv observations of ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( cf .",
    "trentham et  al .",
    "1999 ) , hence the amount of uv absorption they suffer has not been properly characterized .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ f : lf ] is lilly s et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) estimate of the number density of the scuba sources in the redshift range @xmath408 .",
    "this is also in fair agreement with the number density of the @xmath0-dropouts having the same luminosity .",
    "this comparison suggests that the scuba sources may be largely @xmath0-dropouts with modest amounts of dust absorption , rather than being completely opaque in the uv .",
    "furthermore , it suggests that much of the sfr density at @xmath1 can be recovered from rest - frame uv measurements alone .    working against this suggestion",
    "is the fact that none of the hdf scuba sources detected by hughes et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) correspond to known @xmath0-dropouts . however , the numbers are small , and the association with optical galaxies is still not secure .",
    "hughes et  al .",
    "estimate @xmath409 at @xmath1 from their scuba detections which is about half of the @xmath410 we derive .",
    "this is only @xmath16 five times larger than the m96 estimate ( @xmath411 times higher than the m98 estimate ) . like us",
    "they do not extrapolate the luminosity function of their detections , hence the @xmath410 is a lower limit consistent with our estimates .",
    "alternatively , if the scuba sources are at @xmath1 and a non - intersecting set with respect to @xmath0-dropouts ( as suggested by the hughes et  al .",
    "identifications ) , then the sum of the hughes et  al.@xmath410 and that derived from our @xmath0-dropout sample provides an improved lower limit : @xmath412 at @xmath1 which is a factor @xmath413 larger than that estimated by m96 , and @xmath414 times the uncorrected value estimated by m98 .    m98 argue against such a high value of @xmath410 since it would over - produce low mass stars in the present universe if it went on for more than about one gyr .",
    "however , this argument assumes that the lyman - dropouts have an imf with constant salpeter ( 1955 ) slope over the mass range of 0.1 to 125 .",
    "recent observations of local starbursts suggest that their imf is deficient in stars less massive than 3with respect to the salpeter imf ( nota et  al .",
    "1998 ; siriani et  al .",
    "1999 )    since @xmath410 is very model dependent , a more robust prediction of interest is the lower limit to the fir emissivity . summing the predicted fir fluxes of all the hdf @xmath0-dropouts ( using eq .",
    "[ e : irxcal ] ) and normalizing by the volume yields @xmath415 at @xmath416 evaluated at a rest wavelength of 80@xmath400 m .",
    "if the scuba detections are too reddened or dimmed to be selected as @xmath0-dropouts then we can add them to our sample to get an improved lower limit : @xmath417 .",
    "these are still lower limits because completeness corrections have not been made .",
    "these predictions can be tested directly with improved fir , sub - mm , and radio observations ( e.g.  with the upcoming sub - mm array , and the sirtf , first , and planck space missions ) .",
    "our calibration of uv extinction is readily adapted to observations at redshifts other than @xmath1 and hence other spectral domains .",
    "the main requirement is that the data include fluxes in two broad bands or coarse spectra covering the rest frame uv .",
    "redshift information is also helpful , and that can be obtained photometrically to adequate accuracy from complementary rest frame optical - near ir data ( e.g.  from the sloan digital sky survey , or deep pointed observations ) .",
    "for example , serendiptous detections of galaxies with @xmath418 ( e.g.  franx et  al .  1997 ; dey et  al .",
    "1998 ) indicate that galaxy formation had commenced by this epoch .",
    "one of these galaxies is a lensed arc at @xmath419 , whose broad band ( observed frame ) optical - near ir photometry yield @xmath420 ( soifer et  al .  1998 ) , implying @xmath421 mag . upcoming all sky surveys in the uv by galex ( martin et  al .",
    "1997 ) and tauvex ( brosch , et  al .  1994 ) will probe the cosmological uv emissivity to @xmath422 .",
    "extending deep imaging with the hst into the near ir with nicmos allows lyman edge systems to be detected out to @xmath423 ( @xmath306-dropouts ) .",
    "there are a few caveats to using our methods , especially at low-@xmath15 .",
    "firstly , it is based on the assumption that the uv emissivity is dominated by starbursts .",
    "possible contaminants are normal disk galaxies and old stellar populations .",
    "ideally we want to include the uv light from normal disk galaxies when estimating star sfrs .",
    "the problem is that it is not known whether normal disks follow the starburst reddening law derived here .",
    "their cool and warm ism is dominated by a disk morphology , while starbursts typically have significant quantities of extra - planar ism ejected by galactic winds ( heckman , armus , &  miley 1990 ) . in paper",
    "i we suggested that winds shape the ism around starbursts into a foreground screen , thus producing the  - @xmath2 correlation .",
    "further work has to be done to determine if normal disks have a reddening - uv absorption relation and to calibrate it .",
    "fortunately normal disk and starburst galaxies can be distinguished in the uv by effective surface brightness ( paper ii ) .",
    "cosmological surface brightness dimming renders normal spiral galaxies difficult to detect by @xmath1 ( giavalisco et  al .",
    "1996 ; hibbard &  vacca , 1997 ) , hence they do not contaminate the @xmath0-dropout sample . old stellar populations produce significant uv `` upturn '' emission .",
    "if they significantly contaminate a uv survey then the assumption that uv light is due to recent star formation is seriously compromised .",
    "old stellar populations can be distinguished and removed from uv surveys by extending the broad - band sed into the rest frame optical .",
    "secondly , our technique has been calibrated to a fairly modest @xmath424 mag ( fig .",
    "[ f : uvir ] ) .",
    "while the local calibrating sample contains several well known dusty starbursts ( e.g.ngc  1614 , ngc  3504 , ngc  3256 , ngc  7552 ) , it does nt contain any of the `` ultra - luminous infrared galaxies '' ( ulirgs ) which are the most luminous starbursts known ( sanders &  mirabel , 1997 ) .",
    "it is not known if they fall on or continue the  - @xmath2 relationship since the number of these galaxies observed in the uv is rather meager ( trentham et  al .",
    "the amount of totally obscured star formation in the local universe can be estimated by applying our absorption algorithm to a blind uv survey such as will be produced by galex , after correction for contaminants as suggested above .",
    "this will yield an estimate of @xmath328 and also the corresponding density of uv flux processed to the fir .",
    "comparison with @xmath425 derived from iras , iso , or sirtf observations will yield the fraction of completely buried star formation .",
    "the strong similarity between local starburst galaxies and lyman limit systems at @xmath1 provides a strong impetus to use starbursts as templates for interpreting the properties of high-@xmath15 galaxies .",
    "the fact that starburst galaxies redden as more of their uv light is absorbed by dust is demonstrated by a strong correlation between their fir to uv flux ratios and their ultraviolet spectral slopes @xmath2 ( color ) .",
    "our @xmath3 versus @xmath2 calibration is a simple empirical fit to this correlation .",
    "hence , by design it recovers the uv light that has been reprocessed to the fir .",
    "we applied this calibration to a @xmath0-dropout sample selected from the hdf v2.0 catalog .",
    "this sample has an identical limiting mag to that of madau et  al .",
    "( 1996 : m96 ) . however , the color selection is somewhat different , resulting in a fairly uniform limiting @xmath426 mag .",
    "in contrast the m96 @xmath0-dropout sample has a non - uniform bias against large @xmath3 . for our adopted cosmological parameters of @xmath427 , @xmath9 ,",
    "the rest - frame comoving uv emissivity of our sample is @xmath428 without applying @xmath3 corrections .",
    "this is 1.7 times higher than the value derived by m96 , which illustrates the effects of the differing color selections . after correcting for dust absorption",
    "we find @xmath429 , which is factors of nine and five times higher than the uncorrected values of m96 and m98 , respectively .",
    "however , this @xmath328 is still a lower limit because we have not corrected for incompleteness , and we are not sensitive to galaxies having @xmath336 mag .",
    "this study and other recent observations further demonstrate the close correspondence between local starbursts and high-@xmath15 lyman limit systems .",
    "firstly , we find a correlation between @xmath2 ( color ) and @xmath309 ( uv luminosity ) for the @xmath0-dropouts , similar to the correlation seen in local starburst galaxies ( heckman et  al .",
    "1998 ) . to first order",
    "the uv luminosity gives the mass of recently formed stars , while @xmath2 correlates well with metal content in local galaxies ( heckman et  al .",
    "this implies that there is a mass metallicity relationship out to @xmath1 .",
    "since the highest luminosity galaxies are clearly reddened they must have produced enough metals to create the dust prior to the epoch of observation .",
    "hence the first epoch of star formation occurred at @xmath401 in the most luminous @xmath0-dropouts .",
    "secondly , observation of emission lines in the rest frame optical ( observed in the near - ir ) show that @xmath0-dropouts contain ionizing stellar populations to the same degree as local starbursts .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the line flux to uv flux density ratios with @xmath2 for both samples . however , neither the local nor the @xmath0-dropout samples show a strong correlations in these diagrams as would be expected from naive application of uv extinction / absorption laws .",
    "this suggests that the column density of dust towards  emission is higher than towards the uv continuum both in local starbursts and out to @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , the line flux to uv flux density ratio is not a good indicator of dust absorption .",
    "thirdly , the marginal detection of two hdf @xmath0-dropouts at radio rest @xmath430 cm by richards et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) and non - detections of the @xmath0-dropouts in the hdf by hughes et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) is consistent with estimates of the amount of uv flux reprocessed into the fir .",
    "deeper observations in both domains ( by a factor of @xmath431 ) are required to test the dust reprocessing model proposed here , and to confirm whether the fir - radio correlation holds at @xmath1 .",
    "the methodology presented here is readily adapted to other redshifts . for those sources affected by modest amounts of absorption ( @xmath432 mag )",
    ", the intrinsic uv flux can be recovered from uv quantities alone : flux measurements in two rest frame vacuum - uv bands are sufficient .",
    "these observations can also be used to estimate the total uv flux reprocessed into the fir .",
    "hence , lower limits to the intrinsic @xmath433 and @xmath434 can be determined .",
    "integration of @xmath434 and comparison to the fir background spectrum ( fixsen et  al .",
    "1998 ; hauser et  al .  1998 ) will constrain the amount of star formation totally obscured by dust from the ultraviolet .    we thank two anonymous referees for suggestions that improved this paper .",
    "mark dickinson , harry ferguson , piero madau , chris martin and max pettini stimulated our thinking in numerous discussions .",

    "<S> we refine a technique to measure the absorption corrected ultraviolet ( uv ) luminosity of starburst galaxies using rest frame uv quantities alone , and apply it to lyman - limit @xmath0-dropouts at @xmath1 found in the hubble deep field ( hdf ) . </S>",
    "<S> the method is based on an observed correlation between the ratio of far infrared ( fir ) to uv fluxes with spectral slope @xmath2 ( a uv color ) . </S>",
    "<S> a simple fit to this relation allows the uv flux absorbed by dust and reprocessed to the fir to be calculated , and hence the dust - free uv luminosity to be determined . _ international ultraviolet explorer _ </S>",
    "<S> spectra and _ infrared astronomical satellite _ fluxes of local starbursts are used to calibrate the  versus @xmath2 relation in terms of @xmath3 ( the dust absorption at 1600 ) , and the transformation from broad band photometric color to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> both calibrations are almost completely independent of theoretical stellar population models . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the recent marginal and non - detections of hdf @xmath0-dropouts at radio and sub - mm wavelengths are consistent with their assumed starburst nature , and our calculated @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this is also true of recent observations of the ratio of optical emission line flux to uv flux density in the brightest @xmath0-dropouts . </S>",
    "<S> this latter ratio turns out _ not _ to be a good indicator of dust extinction . in @xmath0-dropouts , </S>",
    "<S> absolute magnitude @xmath4 correlates with @xmath2 : brighter galaxies are redder , as is observed to be the case for local starburst galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that a mass - metallicity relationship is already in place at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption - corrected uv luminosity function of @xmath0-dropouts extends up to @xmath6 abmag corresponding to a star formation rate @xmath7 ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 assumed throughout ) . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption - corrected uv luminosity density at @xmath1 is @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> it is still a lower limit since completeness corrections have not been done and because only galaxies with @xmath11 mag are blue enough in the uv to be selected as @xmath0-dropouts . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity weighted mean dust absorption factor of our sample is @xmath12 at 1600 . </S>"
