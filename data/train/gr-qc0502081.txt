    "it is assumed that the matter field satisfies the _ weak energy condition _ @xcite .",
    "it means that the energy density as measured by any local observer is positive .",
    "then , for any timelike vector @xmath15 we have , @xmath16 this amounts to , @xmath17 the evolution of the matter cloud is determined by the einstein equations and for the metric ( [ eq : metric ] ) these are given by ( in the units of @xmath18 ) , + = , p_r-=- [ eq : t6 ] (+ p_r)=2(p_-p_r)-p_r [ eq : t7 ] -2 + r+=0 [ eq : t8 ] g - h=1 - [ eq : t9 ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent partial derivatives with respect to @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively and , g(r , t)=e^-2(r)^2 , h(r , t)=e^-2 ^ 2 here @xmath21 is an arbitrary function , and in spherically symmetric spacetimes , it has the interpretation of the _ mass function _ of the collapsing cloud , in the sense that this represents the total gravitational mass within a shell of comoving radius @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the boundary of the collapsing cloud is labelled by the comoving coordinate @xmath22 . in order to preserve regularity at initial epoch",
    "we require @xmath23 .",
    "it can be seen from equation ( @xmath24 ) that the density of the matter blows up when @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "the case @xmath26 corresponds to _ shell - crossing _ singularities .",
    "the shell - cross singularities are generally considered to be weak and possibly removable singularities .",
    "hence we shall consider here only the _ shell - focusing _ singularities ( taking @xmath27 ) , where the physical radius of all the matter shells go to a zero value ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "let us use the scaling independence of the coordinate @xmath10 to write ,        where @xmath31 and @xmath32 stand for the initial and the singular epochs respectively .",
    "this means we scale the radial coordinate @xmath10 in such a way that at the initial epoch @xmath33 , and at the singularity , @xmath25 .",
    "the condition @xmath34 signifies that we are dealing with gravitational collapse . from the point of view of initial data , at the initial epoch @xmath35 , we have five functions of coordinate @xmath10 given by @xmath36 & @xmath37 .",
    "note that initial data are not all mutually independent . to preserve regularity and smoothness of initial data we must make some assumptions about the initial pressures at the regular center @xmath38 .",
    "let the gradients of pressures vanish at the center , that is , @xmath39 .",
    "the difference between radial and tangential pressures at the center should also vanish , i.e. @xmath40 .",
    "it is seen that we have a total of five field equations with seven unknowns , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , giving us the freedom to choose two free functions .",
    "selection of these functions , subject to the given initial data and weak energy condition , determines the matter distribution and metric of the space - time and thus leads to a particular dynamical evolution of the initial data .",
    "spherically symmetric collapse models , where the radial pressure is taken to be vanishing , but the tangential pressure could be non - zero have been studied in some detail over the past few years @xcite .",
    "the main motivation in the present consideration is to study bounce and singularity formation conditions for the case when we have a non - vanishing @xmath0 term present , when pressures are also introduced and allowed to be non - zero within a collapsing cloud .",
    "one would also like to understand how @xmath0 affects the junction conditions at the boundary where the cloud is matched to an exterior spacetime , the horizon formation , and the nature of central singularity , when non- zero pressures are present within the cloud .",
    "taking @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : t6 ] ) gives @xmath47 and @xmath12 in the following forms , @xmath48 @xmath49}{v^2(v+rv ' ) } \\label{eq : rho } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath50 is an arbitrary function of @xmath10 subject to the energy conditions .",
    "there remains the freedom to choose one function , since there are six equations with seven unknowns . in order to work within the framework of a specific class of models , we take @xmath51 in the specific form , @xmath52    the conditions imposed here , namely that of vanishing radial pressures , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : nu ] ) specifying a form of @xmath43 may be considered to be strong assumptions .",
    "however , this enables us to make our study in sufficient generality with sufficiently rich structure as we shall see below , with non - zero pressures introduced into the collapse model .",
    "a mechanism by which we can have non - vanishing tangential pressures is illustrated by the einstein cluster @xcite .",
    "this is a spherically symmetric cluster of rotating particles where the motion of the particles is sustained by an angular momentum .",
    "this has an average effect and creates non - zero tangential stresses within the collapsing cloud .",
    "also , one can rederive the dust collapse models with a non - vanishing cosmological term , by putting @xmath53 in eq.@xmath54([eq : nu ] ) and redefining the comoving time coordinate .",
    "it is thus clear that the class of models considered generalize the dust collapse models with a non - vanishing cosmological constant . in general , as @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "thus the density blows up at the singularity @xmath25 which will be a curvature singularity as expected .",
    "using eq.@xmath54([eq : nu ] ) in eq.@xmath54([eq : t8 ] ) , we have , @xmath57 here @xmath58 is an arbitrary , @xmath59 function of @xmath10 . in correspondence with the dust models",

    "we deal here with the collapse models , and so the negative sign is due to the fact that @xmath67 , which represents the collapse condition .",
    "one of our main purposes here is to examine how the introduction of a non - vanishing cosmological term modifies the collapse dynamics .",
    "for example , in the case of dust collapse , once the collapse initiates from an initial epoch , there can not be any reversal or a bounce , and the gravity forces the cloud to collapse necessarily to a singularity .",
    "however , this need not be the case when the cosmological term is non - vanishing , and we have to re - examine the collapse dynamics in order to find how the collapse evolves .",
    "this we do here for the particular class of tangential collapse models as specified above , which also generalizes the dust collapse case .",
    "the evolution of a particular shell may be deduced from eq.@xmath54([eq : collapse ] ) .",
    "rewriting eq.@xmath54([eq : collapse ] ) in terms of the scale factor we have , ^2= = v(r , v ) [ eq : gendyn ] where j(r , v)= the right hand side of the equation ( [ eq : gendyn ] ) may be thought of as an _ effective potential _ ( @xmath68 ) for a shell . the allowed regions of motion correspond to @xmath69 , as @xmath70 is non - negative , and the dynamics of the shell may be studied by finding the turning points .",
    "if we start from an initially collapsing state ( @xmath34 ) , we will have a rebounce if we get @xmath71 , before the shell has become singular .",
    "this can happen when @xmath72 .",
    "hence , to study the various evolutions for a particular shell we must analyze the roots of the equation @xmath72 keeping the value @xmath10 to be fixed .",
    "it will be seen that the cosmological constant appearing in the effective potential does play an important role in the evolution of a shell .",
    "to clarify these ideas , let us consider a smooth initial data , where the initial density , pressure , and energy distributions are expressed as only even powers of @xmath10 .",
    "such a consideration , that the initial data be smooth , is often justified on physical grounds .",
    "so we take , ( , r)=_00+_2r^2 + _",
    "4r^4+p_(,r)=p__2r^2 + p__4r^4 + b_0(r)=b_00+b_02r^2 + with the above form of smooth initial data to evolve in time using the einstein equations , we can explicitly integrate eq.@xmath54([eq : t7 ] ) at the initial epoch to get , _",
    "0(r)=p__2 r^2 + r^4+[eq : nu1 ] we have neglected here higher order terms in the expansion , since at present we want to concentrate on the evolution of shells near @xmath38 .",
    "the conditions when the treatment is applicable to the whole cloud will be discussed later .",
    "eq.@xmath54([eq : gendyn ] ) near the center of the cloud may be written as , ^2= [ eq : dyn ] the first factor in @xmath73 is initially positive , because it is the @xmath74 term . as the collapse evolves , the scale factor ( @xmath29 ) reduces from @xmath75 at the initial epoch to @xmath76 at the time of singularity .",
    "hence it clear that the first factor can never become zero , and hence does not contribute to a bounce of the shell .",
    "the main features of the evolution of the cloud basically derive from the second factor in @xmath73 .",
    "the second factor in the effective potential expression is a cubic equation which in general has three roots .",
    "only positive real roots correspond to physical cases .",
    "since the coefficient in the second power is zero , we may conclude that if all three roots are real then at least one of them has to be positive and at least one negative .",
    "we observe that @xmath77 .",
    "hence , any region between @xmath78 and the first positive zero of @xmath73 always becomes singular during collapse .",
    "the region between the unique positive roots is forbidden since in those regions @xmath79 . for a particular shell to bounce it must therefore lie , during initial epoch ( @xmath80 ) , in a region to the right of the second positive root .",
    "we will now analyze the various cases for @xmath3 in detail and derive the necessary conditions .",
    "\\2 . if b_0(r)0 ; ( + 6p__2b(r))<0 we infer from the sign rule that there is exactly one positive root @xmath81 .",
    "the other two roots are negative or complex conjugates .",
    "the allowed space of dynamics is @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "thus @xmath83 would always ensure a singularity .",
    "however @xmath84 implies an unphysical situation initially , where @xmath85 .",

    "the space of allowed dynamics is @xmath90 $ ] and @xmath91 .",
    "the region @xmath92 is forbidden .",
    "shells in the @xmath90 $ ] region initially , _ always become singular_. but shells initially belonging to the region @xmath91 will _ undergo a bounce and subsequent expansion _ starting from initial collapse .",
    "this bounce occurs when their geometric radius approaches @xmath93 . using the definitions = = cos^-1the condition for a particular shell to become singular or undergo a bounce",
    "may be explicitly written in terms of the initial data and @xmath0 as , 1<cos ; singularity 1>cos(+ ) ; bounce [ eq : bounceshell ] here @xmath94 is @xmath88 and @xmath95 is @xmath89 , which are the two roots of the potential function .",
    "note that contrary to the dust models with @xmath0 , there may be a bounce for both positive and negative values of the cosmological constant .",
    "4.3 if ^2=-4 the positive roots are equal .",
    "there is no forbidden region , and there will be a bounce if @xmath96 .",
    "1 . illustrates a particular choice of initial data and @xmath0 which causes a bounce in the central ( @xmath38 ) shell .    to analyze the evolution of shells far from the center , in general one has to resort to numerical methods ,",
    "and it is difficult to analytically give a simple expression for the singularity or bounce conditions .",
    "nevertheless , the analysis as given here becomes valid for the entire cloud all the way till boundary when the geometrical radius of the cloud boundary at the initial epoch ( @xmath97 ) is itself small relative to the initial data coefficients ( ie .",
    "@xmath98 ) .",
    "also , if we choose the initial data such that the higher coefficients in the power series expansion are zero ( i.e. @xmath99 ) and @xmath100 , then the analysis is again applicable to the whole cloud .",
    "thus the results derived can be considered quite general in these circumstances and applicable to the cloud as a whole .    in this context , if all shells in the collapsing cloud satisfy eq.@xmath54([eq : mainbounce ] ) , ( [ eq : bounce ] ) and ( [ eq : bounceshell ] ) , the complete cloud undergoes bounce starting from initial collapse . to avoid shell crossings the sufficient condition would be , r [ 0,r _ ) , _",
    "2(r+)_2(r ) where @xmath101 is an infinitesimal increment in the comoving radius .",
    "it is seen that in all the cases discussed , it is not @xmath0 alone , but @xmath102 along with @xmath103 that determines the evolution of the shell .",
    "this is in contrast to the dust models with a non - zero @xmath0 , where solely the cosmological constant decided the evolution of a shell for a given energy function .",
    "it is also interesting to note that unlike the dust collapse models with @xmath0 , there could be a bounce in the fluid model with vanishing radial pressures for both positive and negative values of the cosmological constant .",
    "this is due to the contribution from the tangential pressure .",
    "it can be seen now that one can rederive the known bounce conditions in @xmath3 dust collapse case ( deshingkar _ et al _ @xcite ) as a special case of the consideration here , when @xmath104 . in that case , ^2==v(r , v ) the study now becomes valid for all shells , without any approximation .",
    "for example , following similar steps as for the fluid model , one obtains for @xmath105 , + 1 .",
    "if b_0(r)>0 the singularity always forms from initial collapse .",

    ", the collapsing cloud has to be matched at the boundary to a suitable exterior spacetime which has the desired properties .    in the present case",
    ", we shall show below that the exterior vacuum spacetime of the collapsing region may be described by the schwarzschild- de sitter ( sds ) or schwarzschild- anti de sitter ( sads ) metric , depending on whether the cosmological constant is taken to be positive or negative . the collapsing interior cloud which has a non - zero tangential pressure is then to be smoothly matched to an exterior spacetime in order to generate the full spacetime .",

    "hence , it follows that _ for both positive and negative cosmological constants , a naked singularity can occur as the final end state of gravitational collapse_.    we noted here earlier that dust collapse models have been analyzed in the presence of a cosmological constant .",
    "the nature of the final singularity in that case has been analyzed using the so called ` roots ' method ( deshingkar s. s. _ et al _ @xcite ) .",
    "we show below that the different treatment we have used above to deal with the collapsing clouds with pressure included , arrives at similar conclusions when specialized to the dust case .",
    "the einstein equations for _ dust _ may be obtained by putting @xmath104 in the tangential pressure fluid model above .",
    "they take the form , @xmath178 @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the dust _ energy free function_. since we are interested in collapse we must have  @xmath1810 .",
    "then we have from the above equations , @xmath182 using the scaling freedom we may write , @xmath183 rewriting equation ( [ eq : ddyn ] ) in terms of the scale factor @xmath29 , @xmath184 define @xmath185 as @xmath186 which is at least a @xmath187 function of its arguments",
    ". then @xmath188 is readily calculated from ( [ eq : ddyn1 ] ) to be , @xmath189 the shell focusing singularity @xmath25 occurs first for the comoving coordinate @xmath38 .",
    "the time of its formation is , @xmath190 as we did for the fluid model , we taylor expand @xmath142 near @xmath38 to get , @xmath191 where @xmath192 ( assuming smooth initial data ) , and @xmath193 with @xmath194 .",
    "again , it needs to be analyzed whether there exists future directed null geodesics that end at the singularity in the past .",
    "consider the marginally bound case @xmath195 .",
    "then the equation of the null geodesic is , @xmath196 in terms of @xmath197 it is written as , @xmath198 choosing @xmath163 , @xmath199    taking the limits as before , the final expression becomes , @xmath200 it follows that for both positive and negative values of @xmath0 , there exists initial data that may give @xmath201 .",
    "thus the dust central singularity may be locally visible , even when there is a non - zero cosmological constant present .",
    "it may thus be claimed that the dust central naked singularity is not precluded by @xmath0 .",
    "the final outcome of gravitational collapse is one of the most important open problems in gravitation theory , and the study of the fluid with vanishing radial pressure , and also the dust collapse models here indicate that the presence of a non - vanishing @xmath0 can not , in any conclusive manner , act as a cosmic censor .",
    "although the value of the null geodesic tangents are modified by the presence of @xmath0 , there are still cases where the singularity is locally visible depending on the initial data .",
    "the global visibility of such a singularity ( null rays from the singularity reaching an asymptotic observer ) which is locally naked , will depend on the overall behaviour of the various functions concerned which appear in the analysis .",
    "but as such general relativity has no natural length scale attached to it , and so a locally visible singularity may violate the cosmic censorship as effectively as a globally visible singularity . moreover , it is seen from various examples that if a singularity is locally naked , then one can always make it globally visible by suitable choice of the allowed functions , or by restricting properly the boundary of the cloud ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also note that studies pertaining to radiation collapse ( of a _ type ii _",
    "matter field @xcite ) in spacetimes with @xmath0 , exist in literature @xcite .",
    "such studies also support the conclusion that both collapse endstates , namely a black hole or a naked singularity are possible in the presence of a non - zero @xmath0 .",
    "the currently observed accelerated expansion of the universe , and also the ads / cft conjecture in string theories have generated considerable interest in spacetime scenarios with a cosmological constant .",
    "we studied here dynamical collapse of a tangential pressure fluid model with non - vanishing @xmath0 .",
    "various aspects of gravitational collapse with @xmath0 have been discussed in the context of the fluid model which include dynamics , junction conditions , apparent horizons , and nature of the singularity . the question of cosmic censorship in the collapse model is discussed , and it is also shown that when the pressures are put to zero in the model it reduces to the dust case .",
    "the effect of @xmath0 on the nature of the central singularity was analyzed .",
    "the condition for local visibility was derived and it was seen that even for non - vanishing @xmath0 both black hole and naked singularity are possible end states of collapse .",
