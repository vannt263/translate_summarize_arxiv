    "the internet of things  ( iot ) is an it system based on a network of smart objects embedded with a sensor , software , and connectivity to exchange data with service providers . in the vision of trillion sensors universe  @xcite , for example , a tremendous amount of smart objects will be deployed everywhere on the earth , and each of them has connectivity to the internet , either directly or indirectly through gateways . to provide such a ubiquitous connectivity with several restrictions to power , memory space , network bandwidth , and processing resources  @xcite , ipv6 over low - power wireless personal area network  ( 6lowpan )  @xcite , which is standardizing by ietf ,",
    "is a promising technology .    in terms of the link layer ,",
    "several low - power wireless technologies , including zigbee / ieee 802.15.4 , bluetooth low energy , and wi - sun , have been developed for supporting iot applications and services .",
    "bluetooth low energy  ( ble )  @xcite or bluetooth smart aims at enabling low - cost sensors to exchange data for short distance , and it has a wide range of applications , including smart watches , home electronics , location - based services such as apple s ibeacon and google s eddystone . the bluetooth specification version 4.1 or newer is required for ipv6 over ble links  @xcite . although the standardization process is ongoing , some operating systems have already supported it in advance .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate the feasibility of 6lowpan over ble through conducting experiments on a commodity hardware environment .",
    "our contribution is a preliminary performance evaluation of 6lowpan over ble , including the power consumption comparing with both wired and wireless ethernet technologies , the impact of the distance between devices and the message size on the throughput , and the application performance based on mqtt .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized into the following sections : section  [ sec : protocol ] presents the overview of a network protocol stack supporting iot services , section  [ sec : experiment ] shows our experimental results in a commodity software and hardware environment , section  [ sec : usecase ] demonstrates a simple mqtt application as a use case of iot services , and finally section  [ sec : conclusion ] summarizes the paper and briefly mentions future work .",
    "figure  [ fig:6lowpan ] shows a typical 6lowpan protocol stack from the physical layer to the application layer .",
    "though 6lowpan is originally designed for ieee 802.15.4-based networks  @xcite , currently 6lowpan over ble is under the process of standardization at ietf  @xcite .",
    "the physical bit rate of ble is up to 1  mbps , and the effective throughput is about one - third of it .",
    "ble has two roles of devices : a master and a slave .",
    "a slave device broadcasts advertise messages until a master detects it . after the link layer connection establishment , 6lowpan initialized the network interface , and ipv6 communication between them is ready to start .        [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we found a critical problem that hub - ctrl turns off all of usb ports on raspi .",
    "therefore , the `` light / control off '' message turns off not only the light but also the ble usb dongle . by using gpio instead of hub - cntl",
    ", we can control ac power supply to external electronics products like this application .",
    "6lowpan is a promising technology in the iot era . to demonstrate the feasibility , we have conducted a preliminary performance evaluation of a commodity hardware environment , including bluetooth low energy  ( ble ) network , raspberry pi , and a laptop pc .",
    "our experimental results show that the power consumption of 6lowpan over ble is one - tenth lower than that of ip over wifi ; the performance depends on the distance between devices and the message size .",
    "since this evaluation is limited , a comprehensive evaluation will be shown in a future publication .",
    "besides , we have observed that the implementation on the linux is not mature enough .",
    "although our mqtt benchmark generates a none realistic workload , we found a serious issue as described below .",
    "our mqtt benchmark have often failed , and any packets do not go through the network after that until rebooting machines .",
    "this issue was not observed with wired and wireless ethernet . to pursue the cause ,",
    "we have updated the linux kernel from the version 3.18 to 4.0 . however , the situation does not change .",
    "a stable implementation of 6lowpan over ble is a future work .",
    "privacy is another big concern for iot services .",
    "we plan to develop mqtt services using homomorphic encryption that allows computations to be carried out on encrypted user data .",
    "such technology can extend the range of application of iot and 6lowpan ."
