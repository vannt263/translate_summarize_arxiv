    "extended emission line regions are often observed around powerful radio galaxies .",
    "high redshift ( @xmath5 ) radio galaxies typically have more extensive emission line regions than lower power radio sources at low redshift .",
    "these emission line regions can be up to 100kpc in size , and are often elongated and aligned along the radio jet axis ( mccarthy 1993 ; mccarthy _",
    "et al _ 1995 ) .",
    "the kinematics of the emission line gas of higher redshift radio galaxies are generally more extreme than those seen in low redshift radio galaxies ; more distant sources have larger emission line fwhm , and larger velocity shears .",
    "the luminosities of the emission lines are large , with rest frame equivalent line widths often exceeding 100 ( e.g. baum & mccarthy 2000 ) .    over the past few years",
    "it has become increasingly clear that in addition to photoionization by an obscured agn , in some cases the emission line gas may also be ionized by radiative shocks associated with the radio source .",
    "evidence for this includes the fact that whilst the spectra of low redshift sources are well explained by agn photoionization , the emission line regions of more distant galaxies do not always display the characteristic line ratios of photoionized regions , and require alternative heating mechanisms .",
    "furthermore , observations of individual sources reveal features suggesting significant interactions of the radio jet with the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the host galaxy .",
    "shocks associated with the passage of the radio source clearly influence the kinematics and morphology of the emission line gas , and can also affect the ionization state within the gas .",
    "another potential source of ionizing photons is uv emission from a young stellar population .",
    "et al _ ( 1997 ) find that the extended uv continuum emission from 4c 41.17 ( z = 3.8 ) , is unpolarised , suggesting that scattered light from the agn is not a dominant source of uv photons .",
    "this galaxy appears to have undergone a major epoch of star formation at @xmath6 . at lower redshifts ,",
    "the stellar populations of radio galaxies are generally old .",
    "most 3cr radio galaxies at @xmath7 exhibit strong continuum polarisation ( @xmath8 , e.g. di serego alighieri , cimatti & fosbury 1994 ) ; scattered light from an obscured agn provides a large proportion of the extended uv continuum . although small amounts of radio source jet induced star formation are possible , this is clearly not the dominant source of aligned continuum emission , nor can it be a major source of ionizing photons for objects at @xmath7 .",
    "spectroscopic observations of a sample of 14 3cr radio galaxies at @xmath9 by best _ et al . _",
    "( 2000a , 2000b ) showed that the ionization state of such sources is strongly correlated with radio size , smaller radio sources generally existing in a lower ionization state . in addition ,",
    "radio sources with linear sizes @xmath10kpc typically have greater emission line fluxes and broader line widths than their larger counterparts . the emission line ratios of smaller sources are in good agreement with the predictions of shock ionization models , and their observed kinematics are more disturbed .",
    "the irregularities in the velocity structures of the small sources are likely to be due to shock acceleration of the emission line gas clouds .",
    "compression of the emission line gas clouds by the shock front and the ionizing photons associated with it combine to lower the ionization state of the gas in smaller sources .",
    "the properties of the larger , older , radio sources , for which the shocks associated with the expansion of the radio cocoon are long in the past , are well explained by photoionization models .    a spectroscopic study of four intermediate redshift 3cr galaxies by solrzano - iarrea _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) found evidence for shock acceleration of the emission line gas in the extended emission line regions ( eelrs ) of all four galaxies .",
    "the disturbed kinematics of these sources are reflected in the emission line spectra by line splitting and/or underlying broad components .",
    "two of these sources have radio sizes comparable to the physical extent of the emission line region , and both show evidence for an underlying broad component in their emission lines .",
    "of the two sources with radio sizes significantly larger than their emission line regions , only one shows evidence for an underlying broad component , although both sources exhibit line splitting .",
    "both of these features can be related to the effects of shocks on the emission line gas .",
    "it is clear that the age of a radio source and the dominant ionization mechanism play a determining role in the observed properties of the emission line regions of powerful high redshift radio galaxies .",
    "it is important to understand exactly how radio luminosity correlates with the eelr properties ; the precise effects of radio jet power on shock acceleration and the ionization mechanism are still uncertain . to this end , we have carried out deep spectroscopic observations of a complete sample of 8 6c radio galaxies at @xmath7 . in this paper",
    "we investigate the effects of radio power on the ionization and kinematic properties of emission line regions by contrasting the properties of our sample of 6c galaxies with those of the more powerful 3cr galaxies at similar redshifts .",
    "a comparison with a sample of low redshift 3cr sources matched in radio power to the 6c subsample will also enable us to break the degeneracy between redshift and radio power present in any flux limited sample ; this analysis is deferred to a second paper .",
    "overall , this research is aimed at adding to our understanding of : ( i ) the physics of the ism in relatively extreme conditions , ( ii ) the impact of agn activity on its nearby environment and ( iii ) the origin of the cool gas which forms the extended emission line regions .",

    "two different central wavelengths were generally used ; the first value selected gave a restframe wavelength coverage from [ nev]3426 out to approximately 4000 , and the second typically covered the spectrum from 3600 to h@xmath24 , or h@xmath23 for the higher redshift sources .",
    "the spectral range provided by each selected central wavelength was chosen to include the 3727 line , and also enable measurement of either the line ratio or the balmer line fluxes of the source in question .",

    "individual blue arm exposures were taken for twice as long in order to reduce the fractional read - noise contribution .",

    "the seeing varied from 0.7 to 2.0 arcsec during the 1999 march observations .",
    "for the 2000 observations , the seeing was more changeable .",
    "the seeing on the first night was between 2 to 2.6 arcsec , but decreased to @xmath371.8 arcsec throughout night 2 .",
    "the seeing on the final night increased steadily from 1.9 arcsec up to non  photometric conditions of greater than 3 arcsec seeing , at which point further observations became unusable .",
    "standard packages within the noao iraf reduction software were used to reduce the raw data .",
    "corrections were made for overscan bias subtraction , and the data were then flat - fielded using internal calibration lamp observations .",
    "the flat field images were made using the same instrumental set - up as the observations for each source , in order to minimize fringing effects .",
    "as red arm images of the galaxies were taken at one or more different observed wavelength ranges for each object , several flat fields had to be taken for each galaxy , and the flat field exposures were interspersed between the observations on - source . taking care not to subtract any of the extended line emission , the sky background was removed .",
    "all observations of a galaxy taken using the same central wavelength and slit position angle were combined as 2-d spectra . for both 6c0943 + 39 and 6c1011 + 36 ,",
    "the slit position angles of different observations differ by @xmath38 .",
    "with such a small difference in position angle , essentially the same regions of the galaxies are sampled by the observations , and so the 2-d spectra of each of these sources were combined at this stage . for 6c1256 + 36 , five different slit position angles were used .",
    "examination of the 2-d structure of the emission lines showed no apparent variation for observations with slit position angles within @xmath39 of each other .",

    "sources for which observations had been made at several different central wavelengths , or very different slit pas in the case of 6c1256 + 36 , could not be fully combined at this stage .",
    "one  dimensional spectra were extracted from the central 4 of the combined ( or partially combined ) data , and wavelength calibrated using observations of the internal cune and cuar arc lamps , which removed the large scale non - linearities .",
    "a slight linear shift of wavelength was sometimes also required , and was determined from unblended sky lines ( osterbrock and martel 1992 ) .",
    "the 1-d spectra of sources taken with more than one central wavelength and/or several slit pas were fully combined at this point .",
    "observations of the spectrophotometric standard stars g191b2b , hz44 , g99 - 37 and bd+26 26 , observed in the same instrumental set - up as the observations of the galaxies , were used to provide accurate flux calibration of the final 1-d spectra .",
    "a comparison of our spectra with the line luminosities of rawlings , eales and lacy ( 2001 ) suggests that use of narrower slits coupled with occasional poor seeing may have led to some slit losses , particularly for the sources with more extensive emission line regions . to create 2dimensional spectra of the line for the analysis of the kinematic properties of the emission line gas , observations of a particular galaxy",
    "were combined where these were taken at sufficiently close slit pas , and the appearance of the emission lines were indistinguishable .",

    "the extracted spectra were then analysed following the procedure described in best _ et al . _",
    "( 2000a ) , which is summarised below .    after allowing for continuum subtraction",
    ", the data were fitted by successive gaussian components , which were only accepted if the signal - to - noise ratio was greater than five and the fwhm larger than the instrumental resolution .",
    "the combination of gaussians providing the best fit ( that with the lowest reduced @xmath48 ) to the extracted spectra determined the maximum number of velocity components which could realistically be fitted to the data .",
    "this approach allows us to search for high velocity components in the emission line gas , or other structures incompatible with a fit to a single velocity component .",
    "the integrated emission line flux , the velocity relative to that at the centre of the galaxy , and the emission line fwhm were determined for each gaussian fit . in order to calculate the emission line fwhm , it was necessary to deconvolve it by subtracting in quadrature the instrumental fwhm , as determined from unblended sky lines .",
    "this procedure assumes that the line emission illuminates the slit in a similar manner to the background sky emission , which is an adequate approximation for narrow slits and imperfect seeing conditions .",
    "errors were also calculated for these three parameters .",
    "this method is optimised for determining the variation of the kinematic properties of the galaxies with position very accurately",
    ". however , the flux levels in each extracted one  dimensional spectrum as a percentage of the total emission line flux of the galaxy are fairly low .",
    "this , and the low s / n levels in the spectroscopic data , makes identification of any broad emission line structures , such as those found by solrzano - iarrea _",

    "this effect seems more important in the 6c sources , especially 6c1217 + 36 and 6c1019 + 39 , which have particularly low equivalent widths .",
    "more importantly , if we wish to compare the 3cr and 6c sources we need to take into account the fact that there is roughly a factor of 5 difference in radio power between 3cr and 6c galaxies .",
    "rawlings and saunders ( 1991 ) showed that radio jet kinetic power is strongly correlated with narrow line luminosity in radio sources .",

    "[ fig : 19]b shows the line luminosity of each source scaled by the ratio of the host galaxy s radio flux density at 151mhz to that of the average for the 3cr subsample .",

    "the resulting line luminosities of galaxies from both samples occupy a narrow range of values , and are anticorrelated with radio size .",
    "this anticorrelation is significant at the 97% level for the 6c subsample alone , 94% for the 3cr subsample alone , but at greater than the 99% significance level when the samples are combined .",

    "if two sources are observed to have identical radio luminosities , the larger source of the two will host an intrinsically more powerful agn , and thus produce more luminous emission due to the strong correlation between radio power and emission line luminosity . by scaling our data to the same radio luminosity",

    "an examination of the line intensity vs. spatial offset plots for the 6c galaxies , in contrast to the equivalent plots for 3cr sources by best _",
    "( 2000a ) , shows that fits to the emission lines of 6c galaxies generally result in a more steeply edged line intensity profile .",
    "this is a result of the much lower s / n in the 6c spectroscopic data , despite the longer integration times of the observations .",
    "we are unable to fit gaussians to the extracted two - dimensional 3727 emission line out to the same spatial extent as would have been possible with higher signal - to - noise data , and as this is the method by which we determined the spatial size of the emission line regions , comparing different eelr sizes within each of the two data sets is not straightforward .    to overcome this problem , we added noise to the two dimensional region about the 3727 emission line for 3cr sources , reducing the s / n to a level equivalent to that observed in the 6c sources . by determining the spatial extent of the region in which fits to the line",
    "could be made in this noisier version of the spectra , we estimated the amount by which the size of the emission line regions in 6c sources may have been underestimated . typically , the addition of noise to the two - dimensional 3cr spectra resulted in a reduction in the deduced size of the emission line region of between 1530% .",
    "[ fig : 20 ] plots emission line region size vs. radio size , after the former has been scaled up by 25% for the 6c sources . it can be seen that after accounting for this reduced s / n of the 6c sources , the relation between emission line region size and radio size for these galaxies is in agreement with that found by best _ et al _ for the 3cr subsample .",
    "we also see that the size of the emission line region is strongly correlated with the range of velocities observed in the emission line gas for the combination of the two samples , although only weakly for the 6c sources alone .",
    "the lack of an anticorrelation in the 6c data is due in part to the position of 6c1257 + 36 on fig .",
    "[ fig : 20 ] , which may perhaps be currently undergoing a jet - cloud interaction , and this may explain its larger than expected eelr size .",
    "one other point to note is that the two dimensional extracted spectra of the 3727 lines which have the most distorted profiles , seemingly indicative of shocks , occur only in the galaxies whose ionization states place them in the shock region of the line diagnostic diagram .",
    "we also see that the smoothly profiled sources occupy the photoionization region of the plot .",
    "the small radio source 6c1017 + 37 has a large emission line region , typical for its radio size , but has a very smooth profile more like that found in the larger , photoionized radio galaxies .",
    "this source lies within the photoionization region of the emission line diagnostic plot .",
    "although radio source size is a fairly reliable indicator of ionization state ( and perhaps ionization mechanism ) , the appearance of the 3727 line also appears to correlate with the best fitting model of the ionization mechanism causing the excitation of the emission line regions .",
    "this result also strongly suggests that the ionization and kinematic properties of the eelrs are fundamentally linked .",
    "a consistent picture emerges from the analysis of the 3cr and 6c observations discussed in section 4 . in summary ,    * the small radio sources ( @xmath82 ) have extensive emission line regions with distorted velocity profiles , indicating multiple components present in the gas , and have line ratios consistent with the predictions of models for ionization by fast radiative shocks .",
    "typically , these sources possess emission line regions similar in size to the radio source , up to 100kpc .",
    "the greater luminosities of these sources compared with the large radio sources is in part due to the increased size of their emission line regions . *",
    "the larger radio sources ( @xmath83 ) have compact emission line regions with smooth velocity profiles , and their emission line ratios are well matched by the predictions of the allen _",
    "et al _ ( 1998 ) models for photoionization by an obscured agn . for these sources photoionized gas",
    "is observed out to similar extents from the agn ( @xmath84 ) in both the 6c and 3cr samples , once the differing signal - to - noise ratios of the observations have been taken into account .",
    "the photoionization models which best fit the emission line ratios of the less powerful 6c radio sources have on average lower ionization parameters ( defined as the ratio of the number density of ionizing photons to the number density of the gas ) than those found in the large 3cr sources .",
    "although it is evident that the two different types of excitation each dominate in a subset of the sources , fig .",
    "[ fig : 14 ] shows that the sources lie along a continuous sequence in the line - ratio diagram and it is almost certain that both processes play a role in the majority of the sources , with the balance between the two changing with radio size .      for large , photoionized radio sources , the total emission line flux scales with radio power for the two samples ( fig .",
    "19 ) and the physical extent of the emission line regions are comparable ( @xmath85kpc ) at different radio powers . these results can be accounted for if the clouds making up the eelr are ionization bounded with a small covering factor ; their minimum sizes can then be estimated using the expression for the h@xmath86 line luminosity given by osterbrock ( 1989 ) :    @xmath87 & = n_e\\,n_p\\alpha^{\\rm eff}_{\\rm{h}\\beta}h\\nu_{\\rm{h}\\beta}v\\epsilon , \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the recombination coefficients for the @xmath90 line and the total recombination rate , @xmath91 is the total volume and @xmath22 is the filling factor ( @xmath92 for an individual cloud ) .",
    "if the flux of ionizing photons reaching the cloud gives an ionization parameter @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",

    ". taking @xmath96 ( from the analysis of the photoionized galaxies as plotted on fig .",
    "[ fig : 14 ] ) and @xmath97 k , the minimum size of an ionization bounded cloud would be @xmath98 pc .",
    "these figures are consistent with the standard picture in which the photoionized clouds occupy only a small fraction of the observed emission line region",
    ".      the emission line ratios of sources with radio sizes @xmath99 can be explained by the predictions of the shock ionization models of dopita & sutherland ( 1996 ) , in which certain emission lines are boosted by shock excitation .",
    "the changing line ratios as compared with photoionization models which successfully account for the spectra of the large sources , are evidence that shock boosting is important in the small radio sources .",
    "for example , the ciii]1909/cii]2326 line ratio changes systematically with radio size .",
    "a similar trend is seen in the spectra of radio sources at much larger redshifts ( de breuck _ et al . _ 2000 ; jarvis _ et al .",
    "another characteristic of the spectra of the smaller radio sources , observed in both @xmath7 subsamples , is a reduction in balmer line flux .",
    "morse , raymond and wilson ( 1996 ) have noted that the high electron temperature produced by fast ionizing shocks reduces the efficiency of balmer emission relative to emission by uv semi  forbidden lines and resonance lines , indicating that this result too is consistent with shock ionization playing an important role .",
    "let us therefore study the physics and energetics of the shock excitation models in a little more detail , to consider whether or not the shock energetics are indeed sufficient to explain the observed properties of the emission line regions .    in considering the effects of the shocks , we must first consider the properties of both the shock and the gas into which it is expanding .",
    "we consider ( cf . review by mccarthy 1993 ) an elliptically - shaped shock wave associated with the cocoon of the expanding radio source , propagating at a velocity of 0.010.03@xmath57 through the ambient diffuse hot ( @xmath100 to @xmath101k ) gas surrounding a massive radio galaxy . cool ( @xmath102k ) dense clouds are embedded in the hot gas with very small filling factor ( @xmath103 ) ; these are in pressure equilibrium with the hot phase , implying a density ratio of @xmath104 to @xmath105 .",
    "it is these cooler clouds that produce the line emission .",
    "the passage of highly supersonic shocks through the cool clouds can have a profound effect on their temperature , density and ionization state .",
    "the shock models of dopita & sutherland include the presence of magnetic fields to prevent excessive compression behind the shock , and predict that the shocked gas is compressed as @xmath106 , which for magnetic flux densities of @xmath107 , determined from estimates of the equipartition field strengths in the radio source cocoons , corresponds to a compression factor of @xmath108 . because of the compression of the gas , the ionization parameter for photoionization decreases .",
    "the effects of cloud compression or expansion alone can not , however , account for the observed differences between the ionization states of large and small sources ; for example , the reduction of @xmath109 from -1 to -3 that would be required for photoionization to account for the observed change in the line ratio between large and small radio sources , would not be compatible with the changes in the observed line ratio ( the implied change in @xmath109 from this line ratio is @xmath110 to 1 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : 14 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , excessive compression of the gas clouds could lead to collisional de  excitation .",
    "since the critical density at which 3727 is collisionally de  excited is @xmath111 ( morse , raymond & wilson 1996 ) , the compressed gas can not exceed this density .",
    "the shock models of dopita & sutherland ( 1996 ) , which assume that all the mechanical energy of the shock is radiated , provide a scaling relation for the total radiative luminosity per unit area of a shock , @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the shock velocity and @xmath114 the ambient density of the pre  shock gas .",
    "the shocks propagate at a much lower speed through the clouds than through the inter - cloud hot gas , due to their greater density . assuming pressure balance , @xmath115 ( mendoza 2000 ) , and so for a typical mean shock velocity of the cocoon of 0.02@xmath57 dependence the actual value assumed is decreased by a smaller factor than this . ] , the velocity of the shock within a cloud is @xmath116 .",
    "this is within the range of values considered by the dopita and sutherland models .",
    "the shocked gas cools on a time - scale of about @xmath105 years according to the dopita and sutherland models , very much shorter than the lifetime of a radio source .",
    "the direct ionization of the cool clouds by the passage of the these shocks will therefore be a short  lived effect , and the associated boosting of emission line luminosities will only be relevant for those clouds close to the bow shock . for",
    "a radio source of about 50kpc size , assuming emission line clouds of density @xmath117 with a volume filling factor of @xmath103 , the total radiative flux produced in the clouds by the direct passage of the shocks will be of order @xmath118w . when compared to the [ oii ] emission line luminosities of @xmath119 to @xmath120w ( which constitutes the majority of the cooling ) it is clear that these direct shocks are not the dominant source of ionization .",
    "further proof of this is that the emission line regions do not trace out the shock front , but seem to extend throughout the volume of the cocoon .",
    "although direct ionization of the cool clouds by shocks can not adequately explain the observations , the hot phase has a filling factor of unity , and the properties of the emission line regions may be better explained by the uv photon field produced by the cooling post  shock hot gas at the edges of an expanding radio source .",
    "assuming that the hot gas obeys the scaling relations of dopita & sutherland , entire shells of the hot phase material can become radiative and act as a photon source for the cool phase .",
    "these photons travel both upstream and downstream from the shock , creating a precursor hii region upstream and strongly influencing the temperature and ionization state of the post - shock gas . indeed , the location of the 6c galaxy data on the line ratio diagnostic diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : 14 ] ) indicates that those shock models which include a precursor ionization region provide a better description of the ionization state for the small radio sources .",
    "the uv luminosity of the hydrogen ionizing radiation field is given by dopita and sutherland ( 1996 ) as @xmath121 the expanding radio cocoon can be approximated as an expanding sphere centred on the agn . before the shock front reaches a given cool , dense gas cloud , the flux of ionizing photons received from the shock as it passes through the hot",
    ", diffuse gas will be roughly the same as that of a point source with the same total luminosity as the shock .",
    "beyond this point , the evolution ( with increasing size of the radio source ) of the flux of ionizing photons from the shock which reach the cloud then depends upon how the density of the external hot , diffuse gas decreases with distance from the host galaxy , and how the velocity of the bow shock varies with radio source size .    in a study of frii galaxy environments , wellman , daly & wan ( 1997 ) found that the variation of the density of the hot diffuse gas surrounding radio galaxies could be well fitted by king profiles of the form @xmath122^{-3\\beta/2},\\ ] ] with central density @xmath123 , core radius @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "studies of radio galaxies and clusters by neumann ( 1999 ) , siebert , kawai & brinkmann ( 1999 ) and heinz , choi , reynolds & begelman ( 2002 ) have found similar values for these parameters . the density of the emission line gas can therefore be approximated as being roughly constant density within the core radius ( 50kpc ) and decreasing proportional to @xmath126 significantly beyond this .",
    "kaiser & alexander ( 1997 ) predict that , in the self - similar expansion of the cocoons , if the environmental density can be approximated as a power ",

    ", the expansion velocity of the largest radio sources in the sample will be approximately constant ( since @xmath131 ) .",
    "we have combined this variation in expansion velocity with radio source size with a king profile density model . integrating over the total surface area of the shock front",
    ", the total output energy from the expanding shock front remains constant over time as it passes through the diffuse gas .",
    "the flux of uv photons received by a cool , dense gas cloud from this expanding shock front is roughly constant prior to the shock front reaching the cloud .",
    "once the shock has passed through a cloud , the flux of photons received by the cloud decreases as @xmath132 as the radio source grows .    using the scaling relations of dopita & sutherland and a mean shock velocity at 12kpc of 0.02@xmath57 in the diffuse igm surrounding the clouds , the precursor luminosity per unit area of the shock front varies with radio source size from over @xmath133 within 20kpc from the agn to @xmath134 at a distance of roughly 100kpc .",
    "our observations indicate that the extent to which we can observe a purely photoionized emission line region is about 25 kpc from the host galaxy .",
    "a cloud at this distance would receive a flux density of @xmath135 from a typical point source of luminosity @xmath136 ( mccarthy 1993 ) .",
    "this is approximately the same as the flux density of a shock at about 40 kpc . for different values of the shock velocity , ambient gas density and agn power , shocks can provide a greater or lesser flux of ionizing photons than the central engine .",
    "it is quite feasible that the precursor field produced by the shocks associated with the expansion of the radio source can ionize the emission line regions out to distances of 50 - 60kpc .",

    "however , for radio sizes @xmath137kpc our assumed values for @xmath113 and @xmath114 are not valid , as the presence of the host galaxy is not included in our model .",
    "the ionization state of a cloud at 25 kpc is dominated by the effect of shocks when the radio source is small ( 20kpc @xmath13870kpc ) .",
    "emission from a cloud at 50 kpc from the agn would be shock dominated out to radio sizes of @xmath139kpc , but would only be observed in our data out to radio source sizes less than or comparable to the size of the eelr ; the combined flux of ionizing photons from the shock and the agn is approximately the same as that from the agn at a distance of 25kpc .",
    "the emission from such a cloud will be dominated by shock ionization .",
    "clouds at a greater distance from the agn than this will not be observable in this model at the sensitivity of our observations .",
    "we note that the expanding shock front is not strictly spherical , as considered in this model , but propagates at different velocities at different locations on the cocoon",
    ". the shock will be most luminous near the radio source hotspots , by a factor of @xmath59 30 - 60 for radio sources with @xmath140 .",
    "this will enhance the alignment effect .",
    "an alternative source of ionizing shocks are interactions between individual gas clouds and the radio jet .",
    "although this would lead to shocked gas clouds closely aligned with the radio axis , the variation in eelr size with radio source size is much more difficult to explain .",
    "an important question is whether or not such luminous shocks are permitted by uv and x - ray observations of radio galaxies .",
    "the total number of ionizing photons emitted from the radio sources bow shocks is comparable to that of a luminous quasar ; however , the spectral energy distribution of the shock waves is considerably steeper in the uv .",

    "an interesting aspect of this model is that if a cloud at 50kpc radius can be ionized by shocks as they approach this radius , that cloud should , in principle , also be ionized by shocks when the radio source has much smaller radii . in practice , however , the line emission is generally not seen much beyond the limit of the radio emission . at first sight",

    "this suggests that the lack of line emission from these regions is not necessarily a problem with the shock models , but rather a general feature of radio sources that the emission line regions become much more luminous after the passage of the radio sources .",
    "further evidence in support of this comes from observations that the emission line regions around radio quiet quasars are not significantly extended ( telfer et al 2000 ) whilst those of radio loud quasars show extensions comparable to those of radio galaxies ( crawford and vanderriest 2000 ) .    clearly , regardless of the ionizing photons that it supplies , the expanding radio source somehow directly increases the emission line observability of regions that it has passed through .",
    "one possibility is that the gas clouds in the eelr are dragged out from a more central region of the galaxy by the radio source for a limited distance and/or time , and so are only present at these large radii after the passage of the radio source .",
    "however , our modelling shows that clouds at distances of @xmath149 from the agn _ can _ be in place prior to the expansion of the radio source and yet not be observed , and that clouds at a distance greater than 60kpc from the agn can not be ruled out .",
    "the presence of extended lyman-@xmath150 halos around radio galaxies ( e.g. van ojik _",
    "et al _ 1997 ) provides further evidence that dense gas clouds may exist out to large radii around radio sources of all sizes .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the passage of the radio jet disrupts large , optically thick emission line clouds , producing smaller optically thin clouds which increases the covering factor for absorption of agn radiation ( cf .",
    "bremer et al 1997 ) .",
    "this appealing possibility also helps to explain the radio size evolution of the optical alignment effect .",
    "the velocity fwhm of the emission line gas is strongly anticorrelated with radio size for both 6c and 3cr galaxies .",
    "this is interpreted as the boosting of the observed fwhm of small sources by shock acceleration and entrainment of the emission line gas clouds over that observed in the larger photoionized sources .",
    "the correlation of both the kinematic and ionization properties of the radio galaxies with radio size within both samples indicates that these are related , regardless of the difference in radio power between the 3cr and 6c galaxies . for the 6c sources , the range of velocities observed displays a weaker correlation with emission line region size and fwhm than the more powerful 3cr sources .",
    "one difference between the two samples is the range of velocities observed in the sources , which appears to decrease with both radio power and radio size .",
    "the weaker 6c radio sources display a somewhat lesser degree of variation in the emission line gas kinematics than is seen among the 3cr galaxies .",
    "this is not likely to be caused by any effects of the lower s / n of the 6c observations ; no evidence is seen in figs.1 - 10 that the fitting procedures are missing further velocity components at greater spatial extents than the regions currently analysed .",
    "if confirmed by a larger data set , the variation in velocity range with radio power could have several different explanations .",
    "large radio sources at @xmath7 have velocity profiles consistent with rotation ( best _ et al _ 2000b ) , as do 3cr sources at low redshifts ( baum _ et al . _ 1992 ) .",
    "@xmath55-band observations show that @xmath7 6c radio galaxies are fainter by @xmath151 magnitudes ( eales _ et al _ 1997 , inskip _ et al _ 2002 ) than 3cr galaxies at the same redshift .",
    "if this is due to a difference in host galaxy mass , the rotation profiles of the less massive 6c galaxies would be a factor of @xmath152 less .",
    "the velocity profiles could alternatively indicate infall or outflow of material . for small radio sources ,",
    "the extreme gas kinematics observed may be due to shocks associated with the radio jet and/or the expansion of the radio source , and would therefore be strongly correlated with radio jet kinetic power , and hence the luminosity of the radio source .",
    "the mean velocity range of small 3cr galaxies is 45% greater than that observed for small 6c galaxies , although this result is based on a very small number of sources .",
    "the more extreme kinematics of the 3cr sources are as expected , given their greater radio power .",
    "very deep spectroscopic observations have been made of an unbiased subsample of 8 6c galaxies at @xmath7 .",
    "many emission lines have been observed over the rest - frame wavelength range 1500 - 4500 , and a study of the two - dimensional kinematics of the emission line gas has been carried out .",
    "our conclusions can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "the observed spectra of the 6c galaxies are quite varied , both in the strength of the emission lines observed , and the line ratios observed .",
    "the composite spectra of the 6c galaxies are similar to those of best _ et al _ ( 2000a ) for the 3cr sources at the same redshift .",
    "6c sources with @xmath83 host less powerful agn than 3cr sources of a similar size at the same redshift .",
    "their spectra are well explained by photoionization , typically with a lower ionization parameter than their more powerful 3cr counterparts .",
    "the total emission line luminosities of large 6c sources are also smaller than that of large 3cr sources , and their emission line regions are observable out to smaller physical scales .",
    "4 .   for small radio sources ,",
    "@xmath153kpc , a combination of agn photoionization and shock ionization provides the best explanation of their spectra .",
    "their emission line regions typically have a similar size to the extent of the radio source .",
    "the velocity profiles of shock ionized eelrs are distorted , whereas photoionized eelrs display smooth velocity profiles .",
    "the ionization properties of the subsample can be explained by a simple model incorporating photoionization by the agn and a luminous shock associated with the expanding radio source .",
    "the kinematics of the eelrs of 6c radio sources are similar to those of more powerful 3cr sources .",
    "a high velocity component is observed in the eelr of 6c1019 + 39 at @xmath154 , close to the host galaxy .    in summary ,",
    "the properties of 6c radio galaxies at @xmath7 are similar to 3cr sources at the same redshift , despite the decrease in radio power between the samples .",
    "a strong anticorrelation of emission line luminosity with source size is found .",
    "in addition , we also find tentative evidence that the range of velocities observed in the emission line gas is most likely dependent on the properties of the radio source rather than the underlying gravitational potential of the host galaxy . in a companion paper ( paper 2 ) , this dataset is compared with lower redshift sources of the same radio power to break the radio power - redshift degeneracy , and to investigate the intrinsic dependencies of radio galaxy properties on redshift , radio power and source age .",

    "in light of the results of solrzano - iarrea _ et al _ ( 2001 ) , as described in the introduction to this paper , we have undertaken a search for such underlying broad components in the 3727 lines of the 6c subsample , and also in the spectroscopic data for the 3cr subsample of best _ et al _",
    "( 2000a , 2000b ) . in the main body of the paper , previous",
    "fitting of a two - dimensional region around the emission line used a series of extracted spectra four pixels in width , stepped every two pixels , with the purpose of investigating the spatial variations of the emission line properties .",
    "as already noted in section 3.1 , a single gaussian fit to the emission line data was inadequate in several cases .",
    "the peak flux was often underestimated for these sources , coupled with a poor fit at high velocities , as expected for mis - fitting the combination of a narrow line with a faint broad component .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the line profiles may be non - gaussian .",
    "we have used a similar process for fitting weak broad components to the emission line using a single wider spectrum extracted from the centre of each source , thus increasing the signal  to  noise over that of the previous extracted spectra .",
    "the new extracted region was typically 9 pixels ( 3.24 arcsec ) in spatial extent .",
    "a wider extracted region could have been used , but in such a situation any velocity gradient present in the 2dimensional spectrum would mimic an underlying broad component in the data .",
    "the same constraints were used as for narrow line fitting , with the additional restrictions that any broad component should be fainter and have a wider fwhm than the first gaussian fitted to the data .    of the 22 6c and 3cr sources studied , only six showed clear evidence for an underlying broad component , with a single gaussian ( or two gaussians for the sources with more than one distinct component ) providing a larger reduced @xmath155 than that achieved with the addition of another gaussian component . these were 3c22 , 3c217 , 3c247 , 3c265 , 3c280 and 3c441 .",
    "several other sources were also poorly explained by a single gaussian fit , however in these cases additional components gave no improvement in the reduced @xmath155 .",
    "the two - gaussian reduced @xmath155 for 6c1017 + 37 was comparable to that for a single gaussian ; for this source the presence of an additional component is uncertain .",
    "the fact that 6 3cr sources showed evidence for broad components whilst none of the 6c sources did is not necessarily significant since the presence of an underlying broad component was rejected for sources for which the 2-gaussian reduced @xmath155 was less than that for the single gaussian fit and the lower signal  to  noise of the 6c data is an important detriment to improving the fit .",
    "we found that in the instances for which a broad component is required , several different combinations of two or more gaussians had comparable reduced @xmath155 . as well as the expected bright narrow line with a weak underlying broad component ,",
    "the data was also generally well fitted by a somewhat fainter narrow gaussian coupled with a strong , broad component .",
    "the fairly low s / n of the data allowed many possible groups of gaussians to fit the data well within experimental error , and so we are unable to determine exactly the parameters of any actual underlying broad component in the emission lines of the sources studied .",
    "we can , however , gain a greater understanding of the inadequacies of single - gaussian fitting , which generally underestimates the peak of the line , and misfits the shape of the wings .",
    "we combined the emission line data of the six sources showing evidence for some underlying broad component , by centering their peaks and re - binning the data to the same fwhm .",
    "a single gaussian was fitted to the resulting combination ; this and the residuals obtained are plotted in fig .",
    "this clearly shows how a single gaussian misfits the data .    on the whole ,",
    "the necessity for broad components is seen to be more likely in intermediate  to  small radio sources .",
    "this is certainly in agreement with the shock  related origins of broad components , as larger sources are in general seen to be photoionized .",
    "on the other hand , the very smallest sources do not exhibit clear evidence for broad components in their emission lines .",
    "however , the complex shock  induced velocity structures of these sources , already fitted by multiple gaussians , will inhibit the fitting of further velocity components .",
    "thus , whilst broad components may indeed be present in these heavily shocked smaller sources , they can not be conclusively identified from these data .",
    "the work of solrzano - iarrea _ et al _ benefited from a higher s / n than our data , as their observations were made with a much lower spectral resolution ."
