    "in vulcano 2004 , in the talk `` space - time fluctuations , '' i discussed some aspects of `` space - time foam ''  a foamy structure of spacetime arising from quantum fluctuations.@xcite to examine how large the fluctuations are , i considered a gedankan experiment in which a light signal is sent from a clock to a mirror ( at a distance @xmath1 away ) and back to the clock in a timing experiment to measure @xmath1 . from the jiggling of the clock s position alone , the heisenberg uncertainty principle yields @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the mass of the clock . on the other hand , the clock must be large enough not to collapse into a black hole ; this requires @xmath4 .",
    "we conclude that the fluctuation of a distance @xmath1 scales as @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the planck length).@xcite i also showed that this scaling of @xmath7 is what the holographic principle @xcite demands .",
    "the present talk is a continuation of the talk i gave twelve years ago .",
    "i will start ( in section 2 ) by rederiving this scaling of @xmath7 by another method @xcite which can be generalized to the case of an expanding universe for which a dyamical cosmological constant is shown to emerge , @xcite a result that was earlier obtained @xcite by a consideration ( in section 3 ) of unimodular gravity @xcite and sorkin s causal - set theory .",
    "then i will discuss my recent work with ho and minic , and later work also with edmonds , farrah and takeuchi .",
    "we found it natural ( see section 4 ) to generalize verlinde s formulation @xcite of entropic gravity / gravitational thermodynamics to de - sitter space with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "the result was a dark matter model which we call modified dark matter ( mdm).@xcite recently we have successfuly tested mdm ( see section 5 ) with 30 galactic rotation curves and a sample of 93 galactic clusters.@xcite    the take - home message from this talk is this : it is possible that the dark sector ( dark energy and dark matter ) has its origin in quantum gravity . and if the scenario to be sketched in section 6 is correct , then we can expect some rather novel particle phenomenology , for the quanta of the dark sector obey not the familiar bose or fermi statistics , but an exotic statistics that goes by the name infinite statistics @xcite or quantum boltzmann statistics .",
    "i would like to take this opportunity to make a disclaimer : in a recent paper  new constraints on quantum gravity from x - ray and gamma - ray observations \" by perlman et al .",
    "805 , 10 ( 2015 ) ) , it was claimed that detections of quasars at tev energies with ground - based cherenkov telescopes seem to have ruled out the holographic spacetime foam model ( with @xmath7 scaling as @xmath8 ) .",
    "but now i ( one of the authors ) believe this conclusion is conceivably premature when proper averaging is carried out ( though presently there is no formalism yet for carrying out such averages . )",
    "we can rederive the scaling of @xmath7 by another argument . let us consider mapping out the geometry of spacetime for a spherical volume of radius @xmath1 over the amount of time @xmath9 it takes light to cross the volume.@xcite one way to do this is to fill the space with clocks , exchanging signals with the other clocks and measuring the signals times of arrival .",
    "the total number of operations , including the ticks of the clocks and the measurements of signals , is bounded by the margolus - levitin theorem which stipulates that the rate of operations can not exceed the amount of energy @xmath10 that is available for the operation divided by @xmath11 .",
    "this theorem , combined with the bound on the total mass of the clocks to prevent black hole formation , implies that the total number of operations that can occur in this spacetime volume is no bigger than @xmath12 . to maximize spatial resolution",
    ", each clock must tick only once during the entire time period .",
    "if we regard the operations as partitioning the spacetime volume into  cells \" , then there are @xmath13 cells , and , on the average , each cell occupies a spatial volume @xmath14 , yielding an average separation between neighboring cells @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite this spatial separation can be interpreted as the average minimum uncertainty in the measurement of a distance @xmath1 , that is , @xmath16 .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize @xcite the above discussion for a static spacetime region with low spatial curvature to the case of an expanding universe by the substitution of @xmath1 by @xmath17 in the expressions for energy and entropy densities , where @xmath18 is the hubble parameter .",
    "( henceforth we adopt @xmath19 for convenience unless stated otherwise for clarity . )",
    "applied to cosmology , the above argument leads to the prediction that ( 1 ) the cosmic energy density has the critical value @xmath20 , and ( 2 ) the universe of hubble size @xmath21 contains @xmath22 bits of information .",
    "it follows that the average energy carried by each particle / bit is @xmath23 .",
    "such long - wavelength constituents of dark energy give rise to a more or less spatially uniform distribution of cosmic energy density and act as a dynamical cosmological constant with the observed small but nonzero value @xmath24 .",
    "the dynamical cosmological constant we have just obtained will be seen to play an important role in our subsequent discussions .",
    "so let us ",
    "rederive \" it by using another method based on quantum gravity .",
    "the idea makes use of the theory of unimodular gravity@xcite , or better yet , the generalized action given by @xmath25(d^3x)dt .",
    "$ ] in this theory , @xmath26 plays the role of  momentum \" conjugate to the  coordinate `` @xmath27 which can be identified as the spacetime volume @xmath28 .",
    "hence the fluctuations of @xmath29 and @xmath28 obey a quantum uncertainty principle , @xmath30 next we borrow an argument due to sorkin , drawn from the causal - set theory , which stipulates that continous geometries in classical gravity should be replaced by ' ' causal - sets \" , the discrete substratum of spacetime . in the framework of the causal - set theory ,",
    "the fluctuation in the number of elements @xmath31 making up the set is of the poisson type , i.e. , @xmath32 . for a causal set , the spacetime volume @xmath28 becomes @xmath33 .",
    "it follows that @xmath34 and hence @xmath35 . by following an argument due to baum and hawking",
    ", we can show @xcite that , in the framework of unimodular gravity , for the present and recent cosmic eras ( with matter fields being essentially in their ground states ) , @xmath0 vanishes to the lowest order of approximation and that its first order correction is positive .",
    "thus we conclude that @xmath0 is positive with a magnitude of @xmath36 , contributing a cosmic energy density @xmath37 given by : @xmath38 which is of the order of the critical density as observed !",
    "the dynamical cosmological constant ( originated from quantum fluctuations of spacetime ) can now be shown to give rise to a critical acceleration parameter in galactic dynamics .",
    "the argument @xcite is based on a simple generalization of verlinde s recent proposal of entropic gravity @xcite for @xmath39 to the case of de - sitter space with positive @xmath0 .",
    "let us first review verlinde s derivation of newton s second law @xmath40 .",
    "consider a particle with mass @xmath3 approaching a holographic screen at temperature @xmath41 .",
    "using the first law of thermodynamics to introduce the concept of entropic force @xmath42 and invoking bekenstein s original arguments concerning the entropy @xmath43 of black holes , @xmath44 , verlinde gets @xmath45 . with the aid of the formula for the unruh temperature , @xmath46 , associated with a uniformly accelerating ( rindler ) observer",
    ", verlinde obtains @xmath40 .",
    "now in a de - sitter space with positive cosmological constant @xmath0 for an accelerating universe like ours , the net unruh - hawking temperature , as measured by a non - inertial observer with acceleration @xmath47 relative to an inertial observer , is @xmath48 with @xmath49 , @xcite where @xmath50 . hence the entropic force ( in de - sitter space )",
    "is given by the replacement of @xmath41 and @xmath47 by @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively , leading to @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "for @xmath54 , we have @xmath55 which gives @xmath56 , the newtonian acceleration .",
    "but for @xmath57 , @xmath58 for circular motions , so the observed flat galactic rotation curves ( @xmath59 being independent of @xmath60 ) now require @xmath61 .",
    "but that means @xmath62 , the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) scaling @xcite , proposed by milgrom .",
    "thus , we have recovered mond with the correct magnitude for the critical galactic acceleration parameter @xmath63 . as a bonus ,",
    "we have also recovered the observed tully - fisher relation ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "next we @xcite can follow the second half of verlinde s argument @xcite to generalize newton s law of gravity @xmath65 .",
    "the end result is given by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 represents the _ total _ mass enclosed within the volume @xmath68 , with @xmath69 being some unknown mass , i.e. , dark matter .",
    "for @xmath70 , consistency with the newtonian force law @xmath71 implies @xmath72 .",
    "but for @xmath57 , consistency with the condition @xmath73 requires @xmath74 .",
    "( note that @xmath69 depends on @xmath0 and @xmath75 . )",
    "actually we can interpret the mondian force law as a manifestation of dark matter .",
    "that explains why initially we called our model ",
    "mondian dark matter \" @xcite , which , to some people , sounds like an oxymoron ; so now we call it  modified dark matter .",
    "in order to test mdm with galactic rotation curves , we fit computed rotation curves to a selected sample of ursa major galaxies given in @xcite , using the mass - to - light ratio @xmath76 as our _ only _ fitting parameter . for the cdm fits , we use the navarro , frenk & white density profile , employing _",
    "three _ free parameters ( one of which is the mass - to - light ratio . ) we find that both models fit the data well ( and more or less equally well ) ! but while the mdm fits use only 1 free parameter , for the cdm fits one needs 3 free parameters .",
    "thus the mdm model is a more economical model than cdm in fitting data at the galactic scale . as for dark matter density ,",
    "the profiles predicted by mdm and cdm agree well in the asymptotic ( large @xmath77 ) regime .",
    "@xcite for details .    to test mdm with astronomical observations at a larger scale , we @xcite compare dynamical and observed masses in a large sample of galactic clusters studied by sanders @xcite using the compilation by white , jones , and forman .",
    "sanders @xcite studied the virial discrepancy ( i.e. , the discrepancy between the observed mass and the dynamical mass ) in the contexts of newtonian dynamics and mond .",
    "he found the well - known discrepancy between the newtonian dynamical mass ( @xmath78 ) and the observed mass ( @xmath79 ) : @xmath80 and for the sample clusters , he found @xmath81    we @xcite have adapted sanders approach to the case of mdm . noting that the argument used in section 4 does allow @xmath69 to include a term of the form @xmath82 with an undetermined universal parameter @xmath83 , we ( in some unpublished work ) have decided to use a more general profile of the form @xmath84 \\ , m\\ , .",
    "$ ] for @xmath85 , we get @xmath86 ( as an aside , we have refit the galaxy rotation curves using @xmath87 and have found equally good fits . ) thus the virial discrepancy is eliminated in the context of mdm ! at the cluster scale , mdm is superior to mond .",
    "what is the essential difference between ordinary matter and dark energy from our perspective ? to find that out , let us recall our discussion in section 2 , and liken the quanta of dark energy to a perfect gas of @xmath31 particles obeying boltzmann statistics at temperature @xmath41 in a volume @xmath28 .",
    "for the problem at hand , as the lowest - order approximation , we can neglect the contributions from matter and radiation to the cosmic energy density for the recent and present eras .",
    "thus let us take @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "a standard calculation ( for the relativistic case ) yields the partition function @xmath91 , where @xmath92 , and we get , for the entropy of the system , @xmath93 . $ ] the important point to note is that , since @xmath94 , the entropy @xmath43 becomes nonsensically negative unless @xmath95 which is equally nonsensical because @xmath31 should not be too different from @xmath96 .",
    "but the solution @xcite is obvious : the @xmath31 inside the log of @xmath43 somehow must be absent .",
    "that is the case if the gibbs @xmath97 factor is absent from the partition function @xmath98 , implying that the  particles \" are distinguishable and nonidentical !",
    "now the only known consistent statistics in greater than two space dimensions without the gibbs factor is infinite statistics ( sometimes called  quantum boltzmann statistics \" ) @xcite .",
    "thus the  particles \" constituting dark energy obey infinite statistics , instead of the familiar fermi or bose statistics .",
    "@xcite    to show that the quanta of mdm also obey this exotic statistics , we @xcite first reformulate mond via an effective gravitational dielectric medium , motivated by the analogy @xcite between coulomb s law in a dielectric medium and milgrom s law for mond .",
    "ho , minic and i then find that mondian force law is recovered if the quanta of mdm obey infinite statistics .    what is infinite statistics ?",
    "succinctly , a fock realization of infinite statistics is provided by the commutation relations of the oscillators : @xmath99 .",
    "curiously a theory of particles obeying infinite statistics can not be local @xcite .",
    "but the tcp theorem and cluster decomposition have been shown to hold despite the lack of locality @xcite .",
    "actually this lack of locality is not unexpected .",
    "after all , non - locality is also present in holographic theories , and the holographic principle is an important ingredient in the formulation of quantum gravity .",
    "infinite statistics and quantum gravity appear to fit together nicely , and non - locality seems to be a common feature of both of them .",
    "@xcite perhaps it is the extended nature of the dark quanta that connects them to such global aspects of space - time as the hubble parameter and the cosmological constant .",
