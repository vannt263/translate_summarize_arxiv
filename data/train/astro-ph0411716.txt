    "751 is in a very tight binary , with the orbital period of only 42 minutes and the mass function of the pulsar @xmath8 m@xmath7 , which gives a minimum mass for the companion of about 0.014 m@xmath7 ( m02 ) .",

    "it improved the fit by @xmath24 ( at 1983 d.o.f . ) with respect to dth .",
    "the disc temperature was much lower and its inner disc radius much larger , making it consistent with an overall picture of a millisecond accreting pulsar ( gdb02 ) or , more generally , an atoll source in the island state ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .    adding the blackbody source of the seed photons ( presumably neutron star surface ) as an explicit component ( model dbth ) improved the fit further by @xmath25 ( at 1982 d.o.f . ) .",
    "the apparent area of the blackbody component , @xmath26 ( @xmath9/8.5 kpc)@xmath27 km@xmath27 , was consistent with a hotspot on the neutron star surface .",
    "however , this component did not produce enough photons for comptonization .",
    "the comptonization spectrum of @xmath28 and @xmath29 kev requires a similar luminosity in the seed and comptonized photons , while the observed blackbody component was @xmath0 30 times weaker than thcomp .",
    "this means that majority of the seed photons were not visible , e.g. because they were covered by the comptonizing accretion column ( fig .",
    "[ fig : shockgeom]b ) .",
    "in fact , spectral fits with compps ( see below ) showed that the actual area of the seed photons source greatly exceeded the expected area of the neutron star .",
    "therefore , we considered one more model ( dbtf ) , which included the disc emission , the blackbody and comptonization of unseen seed photons of much higher temperature ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : shockgeom]b ) .",
    "this model produced a very good fit , improving previous results by @xmath30 = 27.3 .",
    "it gave high seed photon temperature of @xmath31 kev and much softer spectral index of @xmath32 . as we show below in this section , the seed photons in this model were consistent with the hotspot on the neutron star .",
    "next , we tested how sensitive the above results were to the choice of a particular model .",
    "we replaced thcomp by another comptonization code , compps .",
    "it computes the exact numerical solution of the radiative transfer equation for comptonization in a given geometry and allows finding the normalization ( or apparent area ) of the blackbody seed photons .",
    "we chose a geometry in which a slab of hot plasma is irradiated from below by the blackbody seed photons .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 in the model is the vertical optical depth of the slab , so the actual line - of - sight optical depth depends on the inclination angle @xmath22 . unlike thcomp , the unscattered seed photons transmitted through the slab are already included in compps model , so any additional blackbody component in the model corresponds to photons not entering the hot plasma .",
    "this geometry is consistent with an accretion shock above the hotspot on the neutron star surface ( gdb02 ; pg03 ) .    for this model we assumed that the inclination angle of the slab with respect to the observer was equal to the inclination of the system , @xmath34 .",
    "this is , certainly , an approximation , as the accretion shock rotates with the neutron star surface .",
    "however , as we show later in this paper ( see section [ sec : geometry ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : incldelta ] ) the magnetic inclination @xmath35 is small , @xmath36 10@xmath13 , so the angle at which we see the shock does nt vary much .    in the model dbps , corresponding to the geometry in fig .",
    "[ fig : shockgeom](a ) , the temperature of the seed photons was tied to the blackbody component .",
    "the apparent area of the source of the seed photons was very large , @xmath37 ( @xmath9/8.5 kpc)@xmath27 km@xmath27 .",
    "this definitely could not be a hotspot on the surface , unless the distance to the source is less than @xmath03 kpc ( but see section [ sec : distance ] ) .",
    "a fit with seed photons independent of the blackbody temperature ( model dbpf corresponding to a geometry in fig .",
    "[ fig : shockgeom]b ) gave better @xmath38 , but more importantly , yielded much smaller apparent area of the seed photons of @xmath39 ( @xmath9/8.5 kpc)@xmath27 km@xmath27 .",
    "on the other hand , the apparent area of the ( independent ) blackbody component was significantly larger , @xmath40 ( @xmath9/8.5 kpc)@xmath27 km@xmath27 .",
    "the great advantage of compps model is that it computes angle - dependent spectrum . for an intermediate optical depth of the slab of @xmath41 1.52.0 the overall spectral shape of the comptonized continuum",
    "depends only weakly on the observer s angle with respect to the slab .",
    "the main effect is the amount of unscattered seed photons seen at different angles , as it is very sensitive to the actual optical depth along the line of sight , @xmath42 .",
    "so far , we have assumed quite large inclination angle of 60@xmath13 . to check the angular dependence we repeated the fits with models dbps and dbpf at 30@xmath13 .",
    "the dbps fit was dramatically worse by @xmath30 = 75.4 .",
    "smaller angle gave larger , not consistent with the observed spectrum , amount of unscattered seed photons .",
    "the dbpf fit , with more freedom of shaping the low - energy part of the spectrum gave the fits worse by @xmath30 = 7.1 and optical depth of @xmath43 , larger than at 60@xmath13 by expected factor of @xmath44 .",
    "the actual line - of - sight optical depth to the seed photons was about 2.9 , so the observed unscattered fraction of the seed photons was about 5 per cent .",
    "this explains why thcomp , with no unscattered blackbody photons included in the model , could fit the data well . when inclination was allowed to be free , the best - fitting values were @xmath45 and @xmath46 deg , for dbps and dbpf , respectively .",
    "no reflection was significantly detected in any of these models .",
    "we found only upper limits on @xmath47 of 0.06 and 0.41 , from dbtf and dbpf , respectively .",
    "the first model incorporated reflection with a self - consistent iron line @xcite , while the second one included an independent diskline model , with one more free parameter and a less strict constrain .",
    "= 8.5 cm    the total unabsorbed bolometric flux from model dbtf was @xmath48 erg s@xmath15 @xmath49 , which corresponds to luminosity @xmath50 erg s@xmath15 or @xmath51 for a 1.4  m@xmath7 neutron star at a distance of 8.5 kpc .",
    "the contribution to the total luminosity from the disc and blackbody components was 9 and 13 per cent , respectively .",
    "finally , we analysed the _",
    "spectra from table [ tab : obslog ] covering the whole outburst ( observations 221 ) . for spectral fitting we used some of the models from table [ tab :",

    "we also fixed the absorption column at @xmath52 @xmath49 .",
    "model dbth gave a good total ( i.e. summed over all 20 observations ) @xmath53 = 2153.7/2440 .",
    "the spectral parameters remained roughly constant throughout the outburst .",
    "in this model the soft blackbody component was very weak , its normalization ( or apparent area ) consistent with zero in about half of the fits and its contribution to the bolometric luminosity negligible .",
    "on the other hand its temperature was well constrained , as it was equal to the temperature of the seed photons in the comptonized component and constrained by the low - energy cutoff in the spectrum .",
    "when we made seed photon temperature a free parameter ( model dbtf ) , some of the fits become unstable , in particular the electron temperature was not constrained .",
    "we fixed @xmath54 = 42 kev ( the value taken from the outburst average , see below ) .",

    "the results are presented in fig .",

    "the blackbody and seed photon temperatures were slightly higher and the spectral index slightly softer in the beginning of the outburst , but apart from that the spectral shape remained amazingly constant throughout the outburst .",

    "compton reflection was not significantly detected again : the was only an upper limit on @xmath60 , with fit improvement of @xmath30 = 2.0 and two degrees of freedom less .",
    "this average outburst spectrum formed a base for analysis of the phase - resolved spectra in section  [ sec : phase - resolved ] .      in the above section",
    "we have fitted the x - ray spectrum of 751 by models consisting of the emission from accretion disc , blackbody hotspot and optically thin comptonization .",
    "we have considered two types of models , corresponding to hotspot / shock geometries sketched in fig .",

    "the seed photons for comptonization originated from the hotspot ( dbth and dbps , fig .",

    "the seed photons were considerably hotter than the blackbody ( dbtf and dbpf , fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_px]b ) .",
    "the second geometry was preferred both from statistical point of view ( it gave better fit ) and from the physical constraints , as the first geometry required the area of the seed photons source larger than the neutron star surface .",
    "in the geometry of the short shock above the surface , gdb02 ruled out the origin of the seed photons from the accretion disc .",
    "[ fig : profile ] shows the pulse profile of 751 accumulated over the entire outburst .",
    "it was not perfectly symmetric , a fit by a single sine function gave rather poor @xmath53 = 28.3/13 .",
    "with the second harmonic added ( its phase independent of the first one ) , the fit was much improved , @xmath53 = 17.3/11 .",
    "the rms amplitudes , calculated from these fits , were 3.28@xmath610.03 and 0.11@xmath610.03 per cent for the first and second harmonic , respectively , which correspond to the peak - to - peak amplitudes @xmath62 of 4.6 and 0.15 per cent .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] shows the residuals of the single - harmonic fit with the second harmonic function overplotted .",
    "we investigated the energy dependence of the pulse profile .",
    "[ fig : prof3 ] shows the outburst - averaged pulse profile in three energy bands .",
    "the pulse amplitude decreased and its profile shifted towards earlier phase with increasing energy .",
    "this effect can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rms_lag ] , where we calculated the amplitude and phase lag in each of the pca energy channels by fitting their pulse profiles by a sine function . fig .",
    "[ fig : rms_lag]a shows the dependence of the pulse rms amplitude on energy , which decreased from around 3.3 per cent at 210 kev to less than 2.5 per cent at 20 kev .",
    "the absolute value of the time lag with respect to the energy channel 23.3 kev increased with energy up to about 120 @xmath16s at 10 kev , above which it seemingly saturated ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rms_lag]b ) .",
    "the negative time lag means that the hard photons arrived earlier than the soft photons .",
    "this behaviour was very similar to other millisecond pulsars , 1808 ( @xcite ; gdb02 ) , xte  j0929314 @xcite , and igr  j00291 + 5934 @xcite .",
    "the photon statistics in the phase - resolved spectra was very limited , as each of the phase bins contained only a sixteenth part of the total counts .",
    "this made spectral fitting of individual observations difficult .",
    "however , as we have shown in the previous section , the spectral shape remained almost constant throughout the outburst , so analysis of the outburst - averaged data was feasible .",
    "thus , we fitted the average phase - resolved spectrum in each of the phase bins by the models developed earlier in this paper .",
    "the best physically motivated models for the broad - band data were dbtf and dbpf , from which we chose dbtf as it is much faster to compute .",
    "we simplified this model by removing the disc component , which is not constrained by the pca - only data .",
    "we fixed @xmath52 @xmath49 and @xmath54 = 42 kev .",
    "this , however , proved to be problematic . though the total @xmath53 ( i.e. summed over all 16 phase bins ) was very good ( 407/672 ) , there was a strong correlation between the spectral index and seed photon temperature in the limited pca bandpass .",
    "when both parameters were allowed to be free , the fits tended to give very low @xmath63 , hard @xmath64 , and much higher @xmath65 than in the broad - band fits .",
    "these results were inconsistent not only with the epic - pn data , but also with the pca / hexte phase- and outburst - averaged spectrum .",
    "therefore , we forced softer spectral index , and fixed @xmath66 , the value obtained from the pca / hexte outburst - average fit ( section [ sec : xte_fits ] ) .",
    "this gave worse overall @xmath53 = 480/688 , but the fitting parameters were consistent with broad - band fits .",
    "we followed gdb02 in the fitting procedure to eliminate spectral parameters that did not pulsate significantly , i.e. for each the intrinsic variance [ eq .",
    "( 1 ) in gdb02 ] was zero . in each step of the fitting procedure we fixed one of the non - pulsating parameters at its mean value from the previous fit , until we ended up with just two pulsating parameters : normalization of the blackbody ( its apparent area ) and normalization of thcomp .",

    "the second harmonic was not significantly present in any of these profiles , with upper limits of 8 and 12 per cent of the first harmonic , in @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "next , we checked if the spectral variability with phase can be reproduced not by two independently pulsating components , but by change in the spectral index of comptonization .",
    "we modified the above spectral fits , starting with the model where @xmath64 was free but the seed photon temperature was fixed @xmath74 kev ( section [ sec : xte_fits ] ) . in the last - but - one step three parameters were allowed to vary : @xmath71 , @xmath70 and @xmath64 .",
    "both normalizations pulsated with non - zero intrinsic rms , while the intrinsic rms of @xmath64 was zero .",
    "when we fixed @xmath71 and allowed only @xmath70 and @xmath64 to vary , we obtained the overall fit with @xmath75 , much worse than in the previous case ( see fig . [ fig : fars_bbtg ] ) .",
    "clearly , the model with two components pulsating independently was preferred over the pulsating spectral index .    in reality , these two approaches may not be separated . in comptonization models ,",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and fig .",
    "[ fig : angint ] ) .",
    "thus the spectral index of comptonized radiation is a weak function of the viewing angle , therefore , a slab of comptonizing plasma on the surface of the spinning star can produce a spectrum with pulsating spectral index ( as in the second approach ) . at low energies , one expects a contribution from the seed , blackbody photons which , being a strong function of the inclination @xmath76 , can give rise to the pulsations of relative normalizations of soft and hard spectral component ( as in the first approach ) . to check this ,",
    "we have fitted the phase - resolved spectra with compps model , which produces angle - dependent spectrum , where two parameters , inclination and normalization , were allowed to vary .",
    "the fits occurred to be rather unstable , producing multiple minima in @xmath38 for small and large inclinations .",
    "the high - angle solution yields the mean slab inclination of about @xmath77 and amplitude of only about @xmath78 .",
    "such a small variation of @xmath22 would be possible if the shock ( and magnetic pole ) were almost perfectly aligned with the rotational pole of the star .      in the section above we have applied two distinctly different approaches to the phase - resolved spectra . in the first approach",
    "there were two components of fixed spectral shape ( blackbody and comptonization ) , varying independently with phase . in the second approach the spectral slope of the hard component ( comptonization ) varied as a function of phase .",
    "the crucial common feature of these two models was the lag in pulsation between softer and harder energies .",
    "this manifested itself as energy - dependent time lags ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rms_lag]b ) where the hard photons arrive earlier than the soft photons . the model with two independently varying components was preferred over the varying index .",

    "we followed this approach and fitted the pds of all observations from table [ tab : obslog ] by a model consisting of up to three lorentzians . to avoid the uncertainties of the high - frequency part of the spectrum we limited the fit to the frequency band of 0.01100 hz .",

    "the main difference in spectra between 1808 and 751 was the weaker blackbody component in the latter source .",
    "this can be easily explained by larger optical depth of the hot plasma , if the blackbody hotspot is covered by the comptonizing shock .",
    "as gdb02 used models in different plasma geometry than in this paper , it was difficult to compare them directly . therefore , we have fitted the outburst average pca / hexte spectrum of each source with the same model consisting of a blackbody and its comptonization ( compps ) in slab geometry , inclined at 60@xmath13 ( corresponding to dbps model without the disc ) .",
    "we found @xmath81 kev and @xmath82 for 1808 and @xmath83 kev and @xmath84 for 751 .",
    "taking into account the inclination of the slab , the line - of - sight optical depth was 1.8 and 3.4 , and the amount of unscattered seed photons reaching the observer was 17 and 3 per cent , respectively .",
    "one can note here that the product @xmath85 is almost the same in the two sources .",
    "this is natural in the two - phase models ( cool neutron star plus a hot shock above ) , where the temperature depends on the optical depth , because of the energy balance constraints ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the pulsation of the soft component in 751 was significantly smaller ( intrinsic variance of 4.4 per cent ) than in 1808 ( 18.1 per cent ) , though we must stress that different models were used to estimate these numbers .",
    "the pulse profile of the hard component was less skewed than in 1808 .",
    "the upper limit on the second harmonic was 8 per cent of the first harmonic , while 1808 required the second harmonic at 18 per cent level .",
    "the relative weakness of the second harmonic in 751 is expected , since the ratio of the amplitudes of the second to the first harmonic is proportional to the product @xmath86 @xcite , where @xmath22 is the inclination of the rotational axis and @xmath35 is the co - latitude of the hotspot . at the same time , the variability amplitude is also proportional to the same product ( see eq .  [ [ eq : auq ] ] below ) . thus the smaller is the observed variability amplitude , the closer the profile is to a sinusoid .",
    "phase lags between the soft and hard photons were also smaller in 751 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : rms_lag]b in this paper and fig . 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "in both sources the time lags are negative , i.e. hard x - rays arrive before soft x - rays .",
    "the energy dependence was also similar .",
    "the absolute value of phase lags increased with energy up to @xmath010 kev , above which they saturate at different levels : @xmath0 200 @xmath16s ( 8 per cent of the pulse period ) for 1808 and @xmath0 100 @xmath16s ( 4 per cent ) for 751 .",
    "smaller values of the phase lags can result from a weaker soft component  the black body has a very different radiation pattern from the comptonized emission resulting in a different pulse profile ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "there was no compton reflection significantly detected in any of the models used in this paper , while gdb02 reported weak ( @xmath6 ) but statistically significant reflection in 1808 .",
    "on the other hand , the upper limit on the reflection amplitude from _ rxte _ data only ( as used by gdb02 ) was 0.15 , making it consistent with 1808 .        the best - fitting model to the broadband data required three components ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_px ] ) : two soft components ( ` blackbodies ' ) and the hard one ( ` power law ' ) .",
    "we interpreted them as emission from the accretion disc ( low - temperature soft component ) , the hotspot on the neutron star surface ( high - temperature soft component ) and comptonization in the shock above the stellar surface ( the hard component ) .",
    "the simplest argument for this interpretation of soft components came from their apparent area .",
    "we can easily compare them directly by replacing the disc component in dbtf model with another single - temperature blackbody , so the model would consist of two blackbodies and comptonization .",
    "we fitted this model to the broadband spectrum and obtained a good fit . as a result ,",
    "the apparent area of the low - temperature blackbody was @xmath010 times larger than the hotter one .",
    "furthermore , we would not expect any pulsation from the disc , as it rotates independently of the neutron star . since the reflection is low ,",
    "irradiation of the disc by the spinning spot / shock is negligible .",
    "the soft component in the pca band ( the hotter soft component from fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_px ] ) showed clear pulsation with about 4 per cent rms , so it did not originate from the disc .",
    "we can also rephrase this argument in a model - independent way .",
    "if the disc emission had strongly contributed to the pca spectrum , we would see drop in the pulse rms at soft x - rays , but it was not the case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rms_lag]a ) .",
    "therefore , the disc emission must be weak above 3 kev , and the observed hotter blackbody rather comes from the neutron star .",
    "since the hard x - ray emission is pulsed , a fraction of it _ must _ originate from regions confined by the magnetic field .",
    "the most obvious source of hard x - rays is the place where material collimated by the magnetic fields impacts on to the surface @xcite .",
    "however , the pulsed emission can also be released in the magnetosphere further away from the surface ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , an unknown fraction of the x - rays can come from the corona above the accretion disc @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of 751 was fairly constant as a function of pulse phase and our best - fitting model consisted of two components of constant spectral shape pulsating independently .",
    "this favours geometries where all of the emission comes from the same source , as opposed to the sum of separate constant and pulsed components .",
    "the idea of the bulk of emission originating from polar caps is also supported by the observed broadening of the pulse peak in the pds in 1808 due to modulation of the aperiodic variability by the harmonic spin period @xcite .",
    "we can not yet confirm this result for 751 , but the analogy between the two sources makes a strong argument for the emission predominantly coming from the short , heated shock in the polar region .",
    "the constancy of the spectral slope during the whole outburst can be used as an argument that the emission region geometry does not vary much with the accretion rate .",
    "if the energy dissipation takes place in a hot shock , while the cooling of the electrons is determined by the reprocessing of the hard x - ray radiation at the neutron star surface ( two - phase model , @xcite ) , the spectral slope is determined by the energy balance in the hot phase and , therefore , by the geometry .",

    "this would result in a blueshift of the blackbody spectrum , and the effective radius of the blackbody would be @xmath132 .",
    "spectral hardening results from the fact that the absorption opacity rapidly decreases with increasing photon energy and one sees deeper and hotter layers at high energies .",

    "the analysis of the _ rxte _ spectra obtained during the outburst shows that temperature of the soft blackbody photons as well as the temperature of the seed photons decreased monotonically .",
    "the spectral slope of the hard comptonized component did not vary much .",
    "we argued that this favours a constant geometry ( e.g. slab ) emission region and two - phase models , where energy is dissipated in the hot phase and the seed photons for comptonization are the result of reprocessing of the hard x - rays .",
    "the pulse profile can not be fitted by a simple sinusoid , a second harmonic is required .",
    "the mean peak - to - peak amplitude of the first and second harmonic is about 4.5 and 0.15 per cent , respectively .",
    "there is a clear energy dependence of the profile , the amplitude gradually decreases and the peak at higher energies appears at earlier phases ( soft lags ) .",
    "the time lags reach @xmath192 @xmath193 and seem to saturate at about 10 kev .",
    "this behaviour is almost identical to 1808 where lags are factor of two larger .",
    "the observed energy dependence of the pulse profiles can be explained by a model where blackbody and comptonization components vary sinusoidally with a small phase shift .",
    "such a behaviour can result from the doppler boosting and different angular distribution of the emission from these components ( pg03 ) .",
    "the non - detection of the reflected component in the time - averaged spectra and the absence of the emission from the second antipodal spot ( we see almost sinusoidal variations ) put constraints on the geometry of the system .",
    "we argued that the inner radius of the optically thick accreting disc is about 40 km . in that case , the secondary can be blocked by the accretion disc if the inclination of the system is larger than @xmath194 .",
    "blockage of the secondary by the star itself is highly unlikely for the neutron star radii @xmath195 .",
    "the observed variability amplitude constrain the magnetic pole to lie within 34@xmath3 of the rotational pole , if most of the observed x - ray emission comes from a hotspot and a shock .",
    "this work was supported by the academy of finland grants 100488 and 201079 , the jenny and antti wihuri foundation , and the nordita nordic project on high energy astrophysics .",
    "we thank the referee for helpful comments ."
