    "based on chandra observations of nearby star forming galaxies and studies of high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) population in the milky way and smc , @xcite proposed recently that high mass x - ray binaries can be used as a star formation rate ( sfr ) indicator .",
    "they found , that in a broad range of star formation regimes and rates the x - ray luminosity distribution of hmxbs can be approximately described by a `` universal '' luminosity function  a power law with the slope of @xmath4 and a cut - off at @xmath5 , which normalization is proportional to the sfr .",
    "as the 210 kev luminosity @xmath0 of a normal galaxy with sufficiently high @xmath6 ratio ( @xmath7  total stellar mass ) is dominated by the emission from high mass x - ray binaries , the x - ray luminosity can be used as a star formation rate indicator for normal galaxies .",
    "although the normalization of the luminosity function and the number of sources are proportional to the sfr , the @xmath0sfr dependence is non - linear in the low sfr regime and becomes linear only at sufficiently high values of sfr ( thick solid line in fig.[fig : all_points ] ) .",
    "this non - linear behavior at low sfr values is * not * related to intrinsic non - linear sfr dependent effects in the population of the hmxb sources .",
    "it is rather caused by the fact that the quantity of interest is a sum of the luminosities of discrete sources ",
    "@xmath8 , with @xmath9 obeying a power law luminosity distribution .",
    "the non - linear behavior is caused by the properties of @xmath10 probability distribution , namely , the difference between its expectation mean ( average ) and its mode ( most probable value ) .",
    "this effect was discussed in @xcite and @xcite and will be given a detailed treatment in @xcite .",
    "the position of the break in the @xmath0sfr relation is defined by the parameters of the luminosity function .",
    "for particular values of the slope and cut - off luminosity found by @xcite , the boundary between non - linear and linear regime lies at sfr@xmath11 m@xmath3/year or , equivalently , @xmath12 erg / sec .",
    "chandra and asca measurements of the total x - ray luminosity of a number of nearby star forming galaxies were in a good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the predicted @xmath0sfr relation ( fig.[fig : all_points ] , thick solid curve and filled circles ) .",
    "moreover , the distant star forming galaxies , observed by chandra in the hubble deep field north @xcite at redshifts of @xmath13 , also obey the same relation . in the linear high sfr regime",
    "it is given by : @xmath14=\\frac{l_{\\rm 2 - 10~kev}}{6.7\\cdot 10^{39}~ \\rm erg / s } \\label{eq : grimm}\\ ] ] where sfr is the formation rate of massive stars , @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite pointed out importance of two contaminating factors , unrelated to the current star formation activity : ( i ) emission of the central supermassive black hole , which even in the low luminosity agns can easily out - shine x - ray binaries and ( ii ) contribution of the low mass x - ray binaries , which might be especially important in the low sfr regime .",
    "@xcite independently studied x - ray luminosity of normal galaxies using the asca and bepposax archival data and chandra observations of the hdf - n and found a tight correlation between their x - ray , radio ( 1.4 ghz ) and fir fluxes .",
    "they suggested that the 210 kev luminosity of normal galaxies can be used as a sfr indicator and derived the relation : @xmath14=\\frac{l_{\\rm 2 - 10~kev}}{5\\cdot 10^{39}~ \\rm erg / s } \\label{eq : ranalli}\\ ] ] this formula agrees reasonably well with that obtained by @xcite for the high sfr regime , eq.([eq : grimm ] ) .",
    "however , @xcite noted , that the @xmath0sfr relation was linear in the entire range of the star formation rates , including the low sfr regime , in apparent contradiction to @xcite results .    in this letter",
    "we compare the @xcite and @xcite samples of the galaxies .",
    "we demonstrate , that the x - ray emission from the low sfr galaxies in the @xcite sample is likely to be `` contaminated '' by low mass x - ray binaries , which are unrelated to current star formation activity .",
    "after the `` lmxb contamination '' is accounted for , the two datasets agree qualitatively and quantitatively and are consistent with the @xmath0sfr relation expected on the basis of the `` universal '' hmxb luminosity function derived by @xcite .",
    "in the following we denote @xcite and @xcite samples as r and g correspondingly .",
    "the data from both samples are plotted together in fig.[fig : all_points ] .",
    "the two samples , although differently constructed , overlap substantially , with 9 galaxies ( out of 23 in each sample ) , present in both .",
    "the sample r was derived using more rigorously defined construction algorithm . in almost all cases",
    "the authors adopted different distances and different values of sfr .",
    "@xcite derived sfr values averaging the results of several independent estimators based on uv , fir , h@xmath16 and radio flux measurements , whereas @xcite used radio flux measurements .",
    "the x - ray fluxes were obtained from different observations , sometimes by different instruments and are , obviously , affected by variability of the x - ray emission from the galaxies . for some of the galaxies",
    "the x - ray luminosity was calculated by @xcite as a direct sum of the luminosities of compact sources detected by chandra .",
    "the fig.[fig : compare ] compares positions of the galaxies present in the both samples in the @xmath0sfr plane .",
    "note , that the difference in the adopted distances does not have effect at high values of sfr where the @xmath0sfr relation is linear , but it might destroy the correlation in the non - linear low sfr regime .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite used similar selection criteria .",
    "each sample contains seven sources , of which six are present in both samples .",
    "the sources # 185 and # 148 ( according to table 2 in @xcite ) are absent from the r and g correspondingly .",
    "the latter was excluded from sample g because no 1.4 ghz flux was detected , with the upper limit of 23 @xmath17jy @xcite .",
    "the main difference lies in computing the x - ray fluxes and luminosities .",
    "@xcite used 28 kev fluxes from chandra catalog and k - corrected them to 210 kev rest - frame luminosity using the spectral indexes from @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived the x - ray count rates in two redshift - corrected energy bands and based their final k - correction on the recomputed spectral indexes .",
    "the following cosmological parameters were used : @xmath18 km / s / mpc , @xmath19 ( sample r ) and @xmath20 km / s / mpc , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ( sample g ) . the positions of the data points in the @xmath0sfr plane are compared in fig.[fig : compare ] .",
    "due to long evolutionary time scale , the population of low mass x - ray binaries is unrelated to the current star formation activity .",
    "it is , rather , proportional to the stellar mass of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "hence , the x - ray emission from lmxbs can contaminate the @xmath0sfr relation , as exemplified by the milky way galaxy , in which the lmxbs contribution exceeds @xmath23 ( fig.[fig : all_points ] , * ? ? ?",
    "although lmxb and hmxb sources can not be easily separated based on the x - ray data , and optical identifications are ( potentially ) available only for the most nearby galaxies , the number and combined luminosity of lmxbs can be sufficiently accurately predicted based on the stellar mass of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "thus , relative contributions of lmxb and hmxb sources to the x - ray luminosity of the galaxy are defined by its position on the sfr@xmath24 plane ( fig.[fig : sfr_mass ] ) .",
    "stellar masses of the galaxies were calculated using k - band magnitudes from 2mass large galaxy atlas @xcite with the color based correction to the mass - to - light ratio @xcite .",
    "the mass of the milky way was calculated using its k - band luminosity obtained by @xcite from 3d modeling of the dirbe data , and assuming the same mass - to - light ratio as in m31 .",
    "the stellar masses of lmc and smc were estimated from their dynamical masses @xcite , assuming @xmath25 .",
    "the distances for the galaxies from the sample g are same as in @xcite .",
    "we re - examined the distance to low sfr galaxies . for ngc55",
    "( 1.6 mpc ) and m101 ( 7.2 mpc ) we adopted values from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the distances to ngc2403 ( 3.7 mpc ) , ngc2903 ( 9.5 mpc ) , ngc4449 ( 3.8 mpc ) and ngc4654 ( 17.6 mpc ) were estimated from ir tully - fisher relation @xcite using data from @xcite and calibration from @xcite .",
    "the distances to other galaxies from r sample are the same as in @xcite .",
    "the galaxies from r and g samples are plotted in the sfr@xmath24 plane in fig.[fig : sfr_mass ] , along with the contours of constant @xmath26 ratio .",
    "the luminosities of lmxb and hmxb sources were estimated from their respective average luminosity functions obtained by @xcite and @xcite . in estimating the lmxb luminosity we used average normalization for late type galaxies .",
    "although in the limit of large number of sources linear relations hold , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the contours are not straight lines at m@xmath29 m@xmath30 and sfr@xmath31 m@xmath30/yr due to effects of statistics @xcite .    as expected , the `` lmxb contamination '' plays role mostly at low sfr values and becomes unimportant at high star formation rates . in all but one galaxies from the sample r",
    "having sfr@xmath2 m@xmath3/yr , the expected contribution of lmxbs exceeds @xmath32 .",
    "these galaxies are shown in fig.[fig : all_points ] as upper limits . for two galaxies ( ngc55 and ngc2403 ) mostly deviating from the common trend in fig.[fig : all_points ] ,",
    "the expected lmxb contribution exceeds @xmath33 .",
    "the fig.[fig : combined ] shows all data from the samples g and r , excluding duplications .",
    "the tightness of @xmath35 relation at large @xmath7 ( fig.14 in @xcite ) allows one to approximately correct observed luminosities for the lmxb contribution .",
    "this correction was applied for all galaxies , except those with @xmath36 m@xmath30 and @xmath37 . the latter ( ngc55 , ngc2403 and",
    "ic342 ) are not plotted in fig.[fig : combined ] .",
    "the solid curve in fig.[fig : combined ] shows the predicted @xmath0sfr relation , calculated using the parameters of the `` universal '' hmxb luminosity function derived by @xcite from analysis of five nearby star forming galaxies with best known luminosity functions .",
    "it corresponds to the mode of the probability distribution  the _ most likely _ value of the x - ray luminosity of a randomly chosen galaxy .",
    "the dashed line , on the contrary , shows the expectation mean  the value , that would result from _ averaging _ of the x - ray luminosities of many galaxies having similar values of sfr . due to the properties of the probability distribution of the total luminosity of a population of discrete sources , @xmath8 , these two quantities are not identical in the low sfr limit , when the number of sources is small .    due to skewness of the probability distribution @xmath38 ( fig.2 in @xcite ) , large and asymmetric dispersion around the solid curve in fig.[fig : combined ]",
    "is expected in the non - linear low sfr regime .",
    "the probability to find a galaxy below the curve is @xmath39 at sfr=@xmath40/yr and increases to @xmath41 at sfr=@xmath42/yr , near the break of the @xmath0sfr relation .",
    "of course in the linear regime ( sfr@xmath43/yr ) it asymptotically approaches @xmath44 , as expected .",
    "this asymmetry is already seen from the distribution of the points in fig.[fig : combined ]  at low sfr values there are more points above the solid curve , than below . moreover",
    ", the low probability high luminosity tail of the @xmath38 distribution will lead to appearance of galaxies - outliers with significantly larger than expected value of the total luminosity .",
    "such galaxies will inevitably appear as the plot is populated with more objects .",
    "non - gaussianity of the @xmath45 distribution makes least square and @xmath46 fitting techniques inadequate for analysis of the @xmath0sfr relation in the low sfr regime .",
    "we compared results of @xcite and @xcite on relation of the x - ray luminosity and the star formation rate in normal galaxies ( fig.[fig : all_points ] and [ fig : compare ] ) .    addressing the discrepancy in the low sfr regime",
    ", we note that six out of seven galaxies from @xcite , having sfr@xmath2 m@xmath3/yr , are likely to be contaminated by the x - ray emission from low mass x - ray binaries , having no relation to the current star formation activity .",
    "furthermore , at @xmath47 and sfr@xmath2 m@xmath30/yr , the expected luminosity of x - ray binaries does not exceed @xmath48 erg / s .",
    "this is comparable or smaller than that of low luminosity agns often found by chandra in otherwise apparently normal galaxies .",
    "the agn contribution can not be identified and separated , unless high angular resolution imaging data are available .",
    "secondly , the probability distribution of the total luminosity of a population of discrete sources , @xmath8 , is significantly non - gaussian for low values of @xmath49 .",
    "this should not be ignored when analyzing and interpreting the @xmath0sfr relation in the low sfr regime .",
    "the most important conclusion is , however , that after the potentially `` lmxb contaminated '' galaxies are excluded , the two datasets _ become consistent _ with each other , despite of their different content , variability effects , difference in the adopted source distances , x - ray flux and star formation rate determination and in the cosmological parameters used in interpreting the hdf - n data .",
    "the @xmath50 difference in the calibration of the @xmath0sfr relation is insignificant considering the number and amplitude of the uncertainties involved .",
    "they also agree well , both in the low and high sfr regimes , with the predicted @xmath0sfr dependence derived from the parameters of the `` universal '' hmxb luminosity function ( fig.[fig : combined ] ) .",
    "this is an encouraging result emphasizing the potential of x - ray luminosity as an independent star formation rate indicator .",
