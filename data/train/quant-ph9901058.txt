    "it is well known that the continuum propagator of the dirac equation can be found by summing over random walks .",
    "renewed interest in this issue has arisen in connection with the investigation of stochastic processes which have been shown to be related to the dirac equation ( gaveau et al .",
    "1984 , mckeon and ord 1992 ) .",
    "likewise , the correspondence between the path integral and the ising model has been explored ( gersch 1981 , jacobson and schulman 1984 ) and solutions for a discretized version of the dirac equation have been found ( kauffman and noyes , 1996 ) .",
    "as described by feynman and hibbs ( 1965 ) , the propagator of the @xmath0 dimensional dirac equation @xmath1 ( where units @xmath2 are assumed and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the respective pauli spin matrices ) can be found from a model of the one - dimensional motion of a relativistic particle . in this model the motion of the electron is restricted to movements either forward or backward occuring at the speed of light .",
    "assuming units @xmath5 , the motion of the particle corresponds to a sequence of straight path segments of slope @xmath6 in the x - t plane .",
    "the retarded propagator @xmath7 of the dirac equation may then obtained from the limiting process ( see e.g. feynman and hibbs 1965 , jacobson and schulman 1984 ) @xmath8    here , @xmath9 is the number of segments of constant length @xmath10 of the particle s path between its start point ( which is assumed to be the origin of the corresponding coordinate system ) and the end point @xmath11 of the path .",
    "@xmath12 denotes the number of bends while @xmath13 stands for the total number of paths consisting of @xmath9 segments with @xmath12 bends .",
    "the indices @xmath14 and @xmath15 correspond to the directions forward or backward at the path s start and end points , respectively , and refer to the components of @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 accounts for a convenient normalization .",
    "in this short note we demonstrate that a minor conceptional change of feynman s chessboard model naturally and directly yields _ exact _ solutions to the dirac equation ( [ diracequ ] ) .",
    "the conceptional change is suggested by the observation that a path with @xmath12 bends between given start and end points is determined by @xmath18 bends . for a sketch of the situation consider figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the path shown in figure [ fig1 ] exhibits five bends , three to the left and two to the right .",
    "however , the first two bends to the right and left , respectively , determine the path since the location and direction of the last bend ( indicated by a circle in figure [ fig1 ] ) is fully determined by the first four bends .",
    "we thus consider here , in contrast to the original formulation of the model where all bends occuring on a path contribute to the total amplitude , only contributions to the total amplitude from bends which _ actually _ define the path . in the light of the general path integral",
    "formalism it makes perfect sense to consider only those bends which define a path , i.e. the _ minimum _ information characterizing a path .    in the following",
    "we demonstrate by an explicit calculation that the modified model directly leads to exact solutions of the dirac equation ( [ diracequ ] ) .",
    "we will use a calculation scheme different from the combinatorial approach envisaged by feynman and hibbs ( 1965 ) and its ising model correspondence ( gersch , 1981 ) . following feynman s chessboard model",
    "we consider each bend which defines a possible path to contribute an amplitude @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the length of a path segment .",
    "the total amplitude contributed by a path is the product @xmath21 where @xmath22 runs over all the segments followed by a bend .",
    "while the index @xmath23 enumerates the path segments after which bends occur , the value of @xmath22 indicates the corresponding segment . a path with @xmath12 bends which starts with positive velocity ( i.e. to the right ) and ends with negative velocity ( i.e. to the left ) consists of exactly @xmath24 bends to the left and @xmath25 to the right .",
    "the @xmath25 bends to the right may occur after any arbitrary path segment to the left .",
    "@xmath25 of the @xmath24 bends to the left occur in the same manner after path segments to the right while the additional bend to the left occurs after the last segment .",
    "let @xmath26 be the total number of path segments to the right ( + ) and @xmath27 those to the left ( - ) .",
    "then , the contribution of the @xmath28 bends to the right to @xmath29 is @xmath30 for @xmath31 , @xmath32 is approximated by @xmath33 the contribution of the @xmath34=(r-1)/2 $ ] bends to the left is calculated similarly .",
    "the additional bend ( occuring after the last segment to the right ) does not enter the calculation since a possible path is fully determined by the location by its @xmath18 bends to the right and left , respectively .",
    "therefore we find @xmath35 in the limit @xmath36 ( i.e. @xmath37 ) the exact expression for @xmath29 becomes @xmath38 ^ 2}}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 .",
    "with @xmath40 the classical velocity attributed to the particle , @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "thus we have @xmath43 ^ 2 } } = j_0(m t/\\gamma)\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the zeroth order bessel function of the first kind . a similar calculation yields for @xmath45 the same result .    for @xmath46 , the number of bends to the right and to the left is @xmath47 for each direction where @xmath12 is even",
    "however , the path is again defined by @xmath48 bends to the right and @xmath49 bends to the left .",
    "thus , @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 the component @xmath46 becomes @xmath53 a similar calculation yields @xmath54 this completes the envisaged computation . as a side remark note that the presented calculation scheme is not restricted to @xmath55 .",
    "as will be shown elsewhere , similar results may be obtained for @xmath56 .",
    "to relate the components @xmath57 to the solution of the dirac equation ( [ diracequ ] ) consider the explicit represation @xmath58 as may be seen by direct calculation , in this representation @xmath59 and @xmath60 defined as @xmath61 are two independent , _ exact _ solutions of the dirac equation ( [ diracequ ] ) .",
    "this completes the demonstration that feynman s chessboard model yields exact solutions to the dirac equation when taking into account only those bends which _ actually _ define paths . with regard to fundamental theories of spacetime and/or quantum mechanics ( e.g. in the spirit of finkelstein , 1974 )",
    "this could be of importance .",
    "somehow similar results have been obtained from the continuum limit of a discretized version of the dirac equation ( kauffman and noyes , 1996 ) .",
    "the calculation scheme and part of the results presented here can be generalized to unevenly spaced spacetime lattices .",
    "this opens up the possibility to define an analogon to the feynman checkerboard for discrete spacetime models of different type ( e.g. kull and treumann , 1994 ) .",
