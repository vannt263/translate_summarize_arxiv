    "the mass of a star is arguably its most basic characteristic , since most stellar properties have a very steep mass dependency .",
    "yet , it can only be directly determined for some stars in multiple systems , and for most stars it has to be inferred from more directly observable parameters , the luminosity , the chemical composition , and the evolutionary status .",
    "an accurately calibrated mass - luminosity ( hereafter m / l ) relation , or in full generality a mass - composition - age / luminosity relation , is therefore an essential astrophysical tool ( e.g. andersen @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is needed at many places to convert observable stellar light to the underlying mass , and perhaps most importantly , to derive stellar mass functions from more readily obtained luminosity functions . the latter in turn",
    "provide an essential diagnostic of star formation theories .",
    "they also represent a basic building block for galactic and stellar cluster dynamical models .",
    "the m / l relation is fairly well constrained for solar - type and intermediate mass stars : a sizeable number of such stars in eclipsing systems have had their mass determined with better than 1% relative accuracy ( andersen @xcite ) , and the theory of these stars approximately matches this excellent precision , when both evolutionary effects and metallicity are taken into account ( andersen @xcite ) . for both smaller and more massive stars however , the m / l relation is significantly more uncertain , as theory and observations meet there with new difficulties .",
    "here we address the low - mass end of the hr diagram , below 0.6 , where stellar models face two major hurdles ( chabrier & baraffe @xcite , for a recent review ) :    * the onset of low temperature electron degeneracy in the stellar core ( chabrier & baraffe @xcite ; @xcite ) ; * a complex cold and high gravity stellar atmosphere , dominated by molecular and dust opacity ( allard et al .",
    "@xcite ; jones & tsuji @xcite ; allard @xcite ) .",
    "much progress has been made in the past few years , with the realization that an accurate atmosphere description _ must _ be used as an outer boundary condition to the stellar interior equations ( baraffe et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and with an increased sophistication of the atmospheric models ( allard et al . , in prep ) .",
    "state of the art models ( baraffe et al .",
    "@xcite ; chabrier et al .",
    "@xcite ) now produce good to fair agreement with most observational colour - magnitude diagrams ( goldman et al .",
    "@xcite , for an example ) .",
    "this lends considerable credence to their general reliability .",
    "their description of some of the input physics however remains incomplete or approximate : some molecular opacity sources are still described by relatively crude approximations , or by line lists that remain incomplete ( though vastly improved ) , the validity of the mixing - length approximation in the convective atmosphere is questionable , and atmospheric dust condensation and settling introduces new uncertainties at the lowest effective temperatures .",
    "the actual severity of these known shortcomings of the models is unclear , making an independent check of their m / l prediction most desirable .    2.23 mm    [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < , < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     figure  [ mass - theo ] compares the empirical m / l data with the corresponding 5 gyr theoretical isochrones ( for which even the lowest - mass stars on the plot have settled on the main sequence ) of baraffe et al .",
    "( @xcite ; hereafter bcah ) and siess et al .",
    "( @xcite ; hereafter sdf ) .",
    "for very low mass stars these two sets of models are up to now the only ones to use realistic model atmospheres as outer boundary conditions to the stellar interior equations .",
    "this has been found necessary for accurate results in this mass range ( chabrier et al .",
    "@xcite ) . bcah use atmospheres from hauschildt et al .",
    "@xcite , while sdf use the older plez ( @xcite ) models .",
    "besides this , and the different input physics that they use , the two sets of models differ by the technique used to compute observational quantities .",
    "sdf use the empirical bolometric correction tables of kenyon & hartmann ( @xcite ) to deduce absolute magnitudes in the various photometric bands from their theoretical bolometric luminosities and effective temperatures .",
    "bcah on the other hand adopt a purely _ ab initio _ approach , and compute the absolute magnitudes from the stellar radii , the model atmosphere spectra , and the transmission profile of the photometric filters .    at the scale of fig .",
    "[ mass - theo ] the bcah and sdf models are nearly indistinguishable for the infrared bands , and both produce an impressive agreement there with the observational data .",
    "this is particulary striking for the k band , where many measurements define the m / l relation .",
    "the same is apparently true for j and h , where more data would nonetheless be welcome to confirm this behaviour .    in the v band ( fig .",
    "[ mass - theo ] ) on the other hand , neither of the two sets of models reproduces the observations perfectly .",
    "the bcah models and the observations agree well above @xmath10.5  , though with significant dispersion , but they diverge somewhat for lower masses . below 0.2  , the solar metallicity models are systematically too luminous by @xmath10.5 magnitude . as most of the bolometric flux of such stars emerges in the near - ir bands , where the agreement is excellent , the models necessarily provide a good account of the relation between mass and bolometric magnitude .",
    "their overall description of the stars is therefore most likely correct , and the v band discrepancy probably points to a relatively localized problem in the models .",
    "the two leading explanations for this discrepancy ( baraffe & chabrier , private communication ) are either a v band opacity source that would be missing in the atmospheric models , or some low level problem in the physical description of the shallower atmospheric levels which emit the visible flux .",
    "the sdf models by contrast are @xmath10.5  mag too luminous in the v band above 0.3 , produce an excellent agreement with the observations for 0.2 , and look sub - luminous for 0.1 . here again , the excellent near - ir agreement with the observations indicates that these models nicely reproduce the relation between mass and bolometric magnitude , and the discrepancy rests in the v band bolometric correction .",
    "indeed , the sdf models mostly target pms stars and the kenyon & hartmann ( @xcite ) bolometric correction that they use applies for t tauri stars , which have lower gravity than main sequence stars and hence somewhat different colours .",
    "the use of observational bolometric correction , which by definition are unaffected by missing opacity sources , on the other hand most likely explains why the sdf models agree better with the v band observations at @xmath1  0.2 .",
    "the characteristics of very low mass stars are frequently derived from photometry in the redder ccd bands , r and especially i , where these objects are brighter than in the v band .",
    "the validity of the theoretical m / l relation for these red bands is thus of significant interest , but too few vlmss with accurate masses have known luminosities in the r , i , or z filters to provide a fully empirical verification .",
    "one can note however that baraffe et al .",
    "( @xcite ) observe that below t@xmath2  3700  k the bcah model @xmath3 and @xmath4 colours are too blue by 0.5  mag at a given luminosity , while colours which do nt involve the v band are much better predicted .",
    "since the bcah model m@xmath5 are also @xmath10.5 mag too luminous for their mass , this suggests that the atmospheric models have a problem that is specific to the v band .",
    "the model m / l relations for the r , i and z bands are then probably more nearly correct . if valid this inference would suggest that the root of the problem rests in the v band opacity rather than in the physical description of the visible photosphere , which would probably affect a broader wavelength range .",
    "empirical masses of 0.2 to 10% accuracy validate the near - ir mass / luminosity relations predicted by the recent stellar models of baraffe et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and siess et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , down to @xmath10.1  .",
    "they also point out some low level ( @xmath10.5  mag ) deficiencies of these models in the v band .",
    "perhaps more importantly however , the v band m / l diagram represents direct evidence for an intrinsic dispersion around the mean m / l relation .",
    "this had previously remained hidden in the measurement noise , but there is , as theoreticians have kept telling us , no such thing as one single m / l relation for all m dwarfs .",
    "this is particularly true for the visible bands , while the dispersion in the near - ir jhk bands is much lower .",
    "comparisons between measured masses and theoretical models will therefore increasingly depend on metallicity measurements for individual systems , which are not easily obtained .",
    "the @xmath10.5  magnitude discrepancy between observational and model masses derived from visible photometry has some consequences for mass functions determination . as mass",
    "can not be determined for volume - limited samples , the mass function is always obtained from a luminosity function , by writing that @xmath6 and the slope of the m / l relation therefore plays a central role in its derivation .",
    "below 0.5 the d@xmath7d@xmath8 slope of the empirical m / l relation is steeper than that of the bcah models and shallower than for the sdf ones , by 10 to 20% .",
    "their use will therefore respectively underestimate and overestimate the number of lower mass stars by this amount .",
    "probably more seriously , the large dispersion around the v band m / l relation will introduce large malmquist - like biases in the derived mass function , which would need an excellent characterization of this dispersion to be corrected .",
    "the infrared relations have both better agreement with the observations and much lower dispersion .",
    "we strongly recommend that they be used rather than the v band relations , whenever possible .",
    "we thank the technical staffs and telescope operators of both ohp and cfht for their support during the long - term observations which have led to these results .",
    "we are grateful to gilles chabrier , isabelle baraffe , france allard and maria rosa zapatero osorio for many useful discussions .",
    "we are also indebted to lionel siess for providing his models prior to publication ."
