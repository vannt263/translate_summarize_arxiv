    "binary black holes are among the most promising sources of gravitational radiation for the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) and other gravitational wave interferometers .",
    "ligo has recently reached its design sensitivity , making the detection of astrophysical sources of gravitational radiation a distinct possibility . to aid both in the identification of such a signal and in its interpretation ,",
    "theoretical templates of potential gravitational wave forms are urgently needed .",
    "numerical relativity is the most promising tool for modeling the coalescence and merger of binary black holes .",
    "typically , numerical relativity calculations compute a solution to einstein s equations in two steps . in the first step ,",
    "the constraint equations of general relativity are solved to construct initial data , describing a snapshot of the gravitational fields at one instant of time , and in the second step these initial data are evolved forward in time by solving the evolution equations .",
    "different approaches have been used to construct binary black hole initial data ( see , e.g. , the reviews @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "most earlier calculations employed the so - called transverse - traceless decomposition of the constraint equations ( e.g.  @xcite , see also below ) , while most more recent calculations solve the constraint equations in the conformal thin - sandwich formalism ( e.g.  @xcite ; see also @xcite for alternative ways of constructing binary black hole initial data . )",
    "there is general consensus that the latter formalism is better suited for the construction of quasiequilibrium data ( but see @xcite for a very promising alternative approach ) , even though , at least in terms of global quantities , both formalisms lead to very similar results for configurations outside the innermost stable circular orbit ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "dynamical evolutions of binary black holes have long suffered from numerical instabilities .",
    "the past year , however , has seen dramatic progress , and at this point independent codes using very different approaches and techniques can reliably model the coalescence , merger and ring - down of binary black holes @xcite . some of these calculations @xcite treat the black hole singularity with the so - called puncture method @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "given that puncture initial data for binary black holes are most easily constructed in the transverse - traceless formalism ( see @xcite and compare @xcite ) , this development has renewed some interest in transverse - traceless initial data .    in this paper",
    "we construct black hole binary initial data for arbitrary mass ratios perturbatively .",
    "we adopt the transverse - traceless decomposition together with the puncture approach and treat both the effect of each black hole s boost as well the effect of the companion as a perturbation of a spherically symmetric schwarzschild black hole .",
    "both effects are axisymmetric albeit with different axes of symmetry allowing us to find simple analytic expressions for the gravitational fields , the location of the apparent horizon , the irreducible mass , and the total energy .",
    "to leading order we can construct binaries by simply adding the individual corrections , resulting in analytic , perturbative black hole initial data .",
    "the solution is accurate up to order @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the black hole s momentum , @xmath3 a measure of the black hole s mass , and @xmath4 the binary separation , and becomes exact in the limit of infinite separation .",
    "we find newtonian expressions for the energy . while this is not surprising , it is certainly reassuring .",
    "recovering the newtonian limit is also non - trivial , since it requires taking into account the effect of both the boost of the black holes , and the distortion due to the companion black hole .",
    "the numerical construction of initial data for binary black holes in quasi - circular orbit requires significant computational resources , since it involves stepping through nested iterations of elliptic solves , root - finding and sometimes even minimizations along certain sequences ( see @xcite and section [ qco ] below ) .",
    "our perturbative framework allows for a completely analytical treatment , making the construction of approximate binary black hole initial data for arbitrary mass ratios remarkably simple .",
    "our results may therefore be of interest as initial data for dynamical simulations , especially for large binary separations where the errors are relatively small .",
    "perhaps more importantly our results provide analytical insight into the structure of black hole binaries .",
    "several of our intermediate results have been derived previously ( e.g.  @xcite ) , but to the best of our knowledge they have never been combined to construct binary black hole initial data .    our paper is organized as follows . in section [ ivp ]",
    "we briefly review the initial value problem of general relativity and the transverse - traceless decomposition of the constraint equations in particular .",
    "we present perturbative solutions of boosted black holes , of black holes with companions , and finally of binaries in quasicircular orbit in section [ pert ] . in section [ cookbook ]",
    "we outline how the results of the previous sections can be used to construct approximate binary black hole initial data for black holes of arbitrary mass ratio in quasicircular orbit .",
    "we conclude with a discussion and summary in section [ sum ] .",

    "we adopt geometrical units in which @xmath5 .",
    "under a 3 + 1 decomposition  @xcite , einstein s equations of general relativity split into a set of constraint equations the hamiltonian constraint and the momentum constraint and a set of evolution equations .",
    "constructing a set of initial data requires specifying a spatial metric @xmath6 and an extrinsic curvature @xmath7 on a spatial hypersurface @xmath8 that satisfy the constraint equations .",
    "such solutions are usually constructed with the conformal method , whose most general form is given in  @xcite . here",
    ", we investigate a special case of the general formalism , which was known earlier , and which is amenable to analytical treatment .",
    "we introduce a conformal transformation of the spatial metric @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the conformal factor and @xmath11 the conformally related background metric .",

    "we choose conformal flatness @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the flat metric , and maximal slicing @xmath22 , in which case the constraint equations reduce to @xmath23 and @xmath24 quite remarkably , the momentum constraint ( [ pconsimple ] ) becomes linear and decouples from the hamiltonian constraint ( [ hconsimple ] ) .",

    "an appropriate ( singular ) piece is split off the conformal factor analytically , and eq .  ( [ hconsimple ] ) is rewritten as an elliptic equation for the remainder , which is continuous and finite throughout .",

    "solutions satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath179 as @xmath180 and @xmath181 are @xmath182 and @xmath183 ( see also @xcite ) . in section [ pertboosted ] we have factored out terms that are common to both @xmath184 and @xmath185 ( see ( [ pertboostusol ] ) . )      in axisymmetry , the apparent horizon is located at a distance @xmath186 from a point @xmath25 located on the axis of symmetry , where @xmath187 satisfies the following ordinary differential equation @xcite @xmath188 subject to the boundary condition @xmath189 in ( [ horizonequ ] ) we use the vectors @xmath190 and @xmath191 we also abbreviate @xmath192 where capital letters @xmath62 , @xmath193 , etc .",

    "given our assumption of conformal flatness we also have @xmath197 the black hole s momentum enters ( [ horizonequ ] ) through the extrinsic curvature @xmath7 .",
    "it is easy to verify that for vanishing momentum @xmath198 the well - known isotropic horizon radius @xmath199 satisfies ( [ horizonequ ] ) and the boundary conditions . to find a perturbative solution for non - zero @xmath2 we expand @xmath200 where @xmath201 and @xmath202 are corrections of first and second order in @xmath119 , respectively .    to find the first order correction @xmath203 we need to express all terms in ( [ horizonequ ] ) up to order @xmath33 , which yields @xmath204 the resulting equation for @xmath201 is @xmath205 the solution satisfying the boundary conditions is @xmath206 ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "one might expect that in order to find the irreducible mass to order @xmath49 we also need the next order term @xmath207 .",
    "however , as we will see in section [ appboostedmirr ] , this second order terms cancels out , so that in fact we only need the first order correction @xmath203 .",
    "we would now like to find the irreducible mass of a boosted black hole , to second order in @xmath119 .",
    "we approximate the irreducible mass as @xmath208 where @xmath62 is the proper area of the apparent horizon of the black hole @xcite .",
    "it can be shown ( see , e.g. , appendix d in @xcite ) that @xmath209 where @xmath10 and @xmath210 are evaluated at the horizon location , @xmath211 . from the expansion ( [ h_expand ] ) of @xmath89 we have @xmath212 since @xmath213 is spherically symmetric . the horizon area ( [ appboosteda ] )",
    "therefore splits into the two terms @xmath214 we now insert the expansions @xmath215 and @xmath216 taking these terms to their respective powers we find @xmath217 and @xmath218 which we can now insert into ( [ appboosteda2 ] ) to find @xmath219 quite remarkably , the second order term @xmath202 has canceled out of this expression .    to evaluate the horizon area",
    "we insert @xmath220 ( equation ( [ up ] ) ) from appendix [ appboostedpsi ] and @xmath203 ( equation ( [ hp ] ) ) from appendix [ appboostedh ] .",
    "since we are only working to second order in @xmath33 it is sufficient to evaluate @xmath221 at the unperturbed horizon location @xmath213 , @xmath222 in yet another remarkable happenstance the unattractive log terms disappear when the integration is carried out , and we are left with @xmath223 and therefore @xmath224 even though we have carried out this calculation only to order @xmath49 , it is clear that neither the area nor the mass can depend on the sign of @xmath2 , so that all odd order terms must disappear .",
    "we have also verified this by comparing with numerical data in fig .",

    "the adm energy @xmath59 is defined as @xmath225 according to ( [ con_factor_p ] ) we write the conformal factor as @xmath226 .",
    "the correction term @xmath221 is given by ( [ up ] ) , and evaluating its leading order term as @xmath180 we find @xmath227 the adm energy therefore becomes @xmath228",
    "the _ exact _ solution for the conformal factor @xmath10 describing two static black holes is given by @xmath229 focusing on @xmath39 we would like to eliminate the dependence on @xmath230 , which we can do in terms of the expansion @xmath231 here @xmath172 is the angle between @xmath232 and @xmath233 . since we are only interested in terms up to order @xmath234 it is sufficient to keep the @xmath235 term as long as we restrict analysis to a neighborhood of @xmath39 , where @xmath236 .",
    "near @xmath39 we then have @xmath237 and hence @xmath238 and similar for @xmath40 .",
    "borrowing the notation for boosted black holes we denote @xmath239 and similar for @xmath40 .",
    "evidently the effect of a companion on an otherwise spherical black hole must be axisymmetric in nature . to find the irreducible mass of the perturbed black hole @xmath39 we can therefore again evaluate the integral ( [ appboosteda4terms ] ) , with @xmath221 replaced by @xmath240 ( equation ( [ u_c ] ) . )",
    "as before we can expand the horizon location as @xmath241 unlike in the case of a boosted black hole , however , we are only interested in terms up to order @xmath37 . since the leading order term @xmath242 scales with @xmath37 and enters into the irreducible mass only squared , we may neglect its contributions .",
    "the only terms that remain in ( [ appboosteda4terms ] ) are therefore the first two . inserting ( [ u_c ] )",
    "we immediately find @xmath243 and hence @xmath244 interchanging indices yields @xmath81 .",

    "the source term @xmath167 is @xmath246 where @xmath166 is defined in ( [ pertcompalpha ] ) and the extrinsic curvature @xmath13 is given by ( [ genaij ] ) as the sum of the individual terms for the two black holes .",
    "given that this source term is non - linear , it is not immediately evident that we can simply superpose two single boosted black hole solutions @xmath247 each of which satisfies ( [ appbinhamu ] ) with their individual source term , e.g. @xmath248 the superposition ( [ uguess ] ) only satisfies ( [ appbinhamu ] ) to the required order if @xmath249 this , however , is indeed the case .",
    "any point in space is at least a coordinate distance @xmath250 separated from one of the black holes . for concreteness ,",
    "consider a point that is at least a distance @xmath250 separated from @xmath40 . expanding @xmath167 at this point shows @xmath251 and we also have @xmath252 .",
    "therefore , the superposition ( [ uguess ] ) is a solution to ( [ appbinhamu ] ) to the required order .",
    "we point out that the non - linearity of @xmath167 prevents us from also including spin in our analysis . allowing for non - zero spin amounts to including additional terms in the extrinsic curvature , which then lead to cross - terms in the source term ( [ appbinbeta ] ) .",
    "perturbative solutions describing stationary , spinning black holes exist , but because of these cross - terms they can not simply be added to the perturbative solutions describing non - spinning , boosted black holes to construct spinning , boosted black holes .",
    "we finally argue why the correction to the irreducible mass of a boosted black hole with a companion is the sum of the corrections for a boost and the presence of a companion . in the neighborhood of @xmath39 , for example",
    ", the conformal factor is given by ( [ pertbinpsisol ] ) , @xmath253 where @xmath254 , and @xmath39 s horizon is located at @xmath255 as before , higher order corrections to the location of the horizon drop out .",
    "we can now proceed exactly as in appendix [ appboostedmirr ] , using the combined correction @xmath256 to the conformal factor , and find @xmath257 the irreducible mass is therefore @xmath258 as expected ."
