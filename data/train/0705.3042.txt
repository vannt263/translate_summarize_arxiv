    "gravitational lensing statistics have now been used to map the mass distribution in galaxies ( blandford & narayan 1992 ; narayan & bartelmann 1996 ; kochanek 2004 ) as well as to constrain cosmological parameters ( cheng & krauss 1998 ; chae 2003 ; maoz 2005 ) . since the discovery of the first multiply imaged quasar ( walsh , carswell & weymann 1979 ) , well over a hundred such systems have now been discovered in various wave - bands , ranging from the optical to the radio .",
    "this progress is attributed to several dedicated on - going all sky surveys like the class ( myers et al .",
    "2003 ) , the sdss ( york et al . 2000 ) , the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; colless et al . 2001 ) and more recently the slacs ( bolton et al . 2006 ) .",
    "consequently , there has also been significant progress in analytical and statistical studies of lenses .",
    "many sophisticated methods are now available to model strong lensing systems using both parametric and non - parametric mass distributions ( e.g. rusin , kochanek & keeton 2003 ; saha & williams 2003 ) .    the concept of optical depth to lensing ( odtl ) was proposed to study strong lensing statistics by turner , ostriker & gott ( hereafter tog , 1984 ) : they presented an analytic calculation of the lensing probability of distant quasars by intervening galaxy lenses and the role of selection effects therein .",
    "since the lensing probability depends on the comoving volume element , the odtl test can be used to constrain cosmological parameters by comparing the number of expected lenses to the number of observed ones . using the odtl test , kochanek ( hereafter k96 , 1996 ) obtained limits on the cosmological constant from the statistics of gravitational lenses using a number of completed quasar surveys ( e.g. snapshot survey , the eso / lige survey , the not survey , the hst gto survey , the fks survey ) , lens data , and a range of lens models .",
    "the formal limit obtained was @xmath0 at 95% confidence in flat cosmologies , which included the statistical uncertainties in the number of lenses , galaxies , quasars , and the parameters relating galaxy luminosities to dynamical variables .",
    "this value is in contrast to what is now well established by wmap observations of the cmb ( e.g. spergel et al .",
    "2006 ) and high redshift sn ia observations ( riess et al . 1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) .",
    "these observations have in fact led to what is currently referred to as a ` cosmic concordance ' model ( ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ) - the @xmath1-cdm model ( with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) - as the most widely accepted description of the universe .",
    "it has been argued by k96 that their retrieved low value for @xmath6 could be due to dust obscuration in a large fraction of lensing galaxies : however , a hundred times more dust is needed to change the expected number of lenses by a factor of two .",
    "given this extreme value , dust is clearly not the dominant source of systematic errors . by tabulating various sources of error and the limitations imposed on the accuracy of the determination of @xmath6 , k96 speculated that the assumptions on the velocity dispersion function of lenses might be a significant source of error .",
    "reviewing previous estimates of the cosmological constant derived from strong lensing statistics maoz ( 2005 ) concludes that the discrepancies might be due to possibly a lower lensing cross section for ellipticals galaxies than assumed in the past .",
    "maoz ( 2005 ) argues that the current agreement between recent model calculations and the results of radio lens surveys may be fortuitous , and due to a cancellation between the errors in the input parameters for the lens population and the cosmology , as well as input parameters for the source populations .    in the quest to determine the correct underlying cosmological model by placing better and tighter constraints on @xmath6",
    ", strong gravitational lensing has not been the most reliable technique .",
    "systematic errors have plagued the lensing analysis , leading to contradictory results for the derived values of the cosmological constant in a flat universe ( see , for example , maoz & rix 1993 , k96 , chae et al .",
    "these contradictory results were primarily caused by : small number statistics due to the shortage of observed lens systems ; assumptions about the relationship between luminosities and masses of galaxies ; scatter in the empirical relation between mass and light ; and observational biases , mainly the magnification bias .",
    "an explicit relation between mass and light is required for the lensing analysis in the absence of independent mass estimates for the lensing galaxies .",
    "the luminosity of galaxies is converted into a mass distribution ( which is the relevant quantity to model lensing effects ) using a density profile , which is parametrized via the velocity dispersion .",
    "statistics of strong lenses and any cosmological constraints thereby obtained depend on the assumed velocity dispersion function ( vdf ) of galaxies .",
    "kochanek ( hereafter k92 , 1992 ) , devised a test , the ` lens - redshift test ' , which circumvented the magnification bias since it does not involve computing the total odtl .",
    "this test relies on the computation of the _ differential optical depth to lensing _ with respect to the angular critical radius @xmath7 .",
    "the probability distributions of lens redshifts @xmath8 with a given angular critical radius , @xmath9(r)$ ] , are evaluated .",
    "however , this quantity still required knowledge of the vdf of lensing galaxies , which was inferred ( hence ivdf ) by combining the schechter luminosity function with an empirical relation between luminosity and velocity dispersion , the faber - jackson and the tully - fisher relations for early - type and late - type galaxies , respectively .",
    "the lens - redshift test depends on cosmological parameters as well as on galaxy evolution parameters .",
    "therefore , it can be used to constrain the former by fixing the latter , or vice versa . with the assumption of no evolution",
    ", k92 derived @xmath10 .",
    "ofek , rix & maoz ( hereafter orm , 2003 ) revived the lens - redshift test ( k92 ) .",
    "they applied it to a larger sample of lens systems than were available to the k92 analysis , using the class and sdss surveys .",
    "their study also included a re - derivation and generalisation of the lens - redshift test , which incorporated mass and number density evolution of lens galaxies .",
    "they explicitly included the redshift evolution of the characteristic velocity dispersion and evolution of the number density of galaxies .",
    "the limit obtained by orm for a flat universe , assuming no mass evolution of early - type galaxies between @xmath8 = 01 , was @xmath11 at the 99% confidence limit . turning things around , and fixing the cosmological model to @xmath12 and @xmath13 , they determined galaxy evolution parameters and found @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the characteristic velocity dispersion and number density of lensing galaxies , respectively .",
    "mitchell et al .",
    "( hereafter mkfs , 2005 ) focused instead on the odtl test ( tog ) .",
    "in addition to using a larger sample than the one used by k96 , they included the evolution of the vdf in amplitude and shape , based on theoretical galaxy formation models , and used the measured velocity distribution function ( mvdf ) for early - types from the sdss ( sheth et al .",
    "mkfs found @xmath6 = 0.740.78 for a flat universe prior and a limit @xmath18 at the 95% confidence limit . including the effects of galaxy evolution , they found @xmath6 = 0.720.78 and a limit @xmath19 at the 95% confidence limit .",
    "the consequence of using the mvdf versus the ivdf in the determination of @xmath6 is one of the key questions we address in this work .",
    "the ivdf and mvdf differ at high luminosities / velocity dispersions ( see fig .",
    "a1 in the appendix ) .",
    "the scatter of the faber - jackson relation was a predominant source of uncertainty in the previous studies ( cf .",
    "orm ) , leading to a systematic underestimation of the number of objects with large velocity dispersions .    in this paper ,",
    "we investigate the lens - redshift test in detail and re - examine the uncertainties that limit its use as a powerful discriminant between cosmological models , as well as its potential to constrain galaxy evolution models .",
    "we apply this to a new enlarged sample of lenses .",
    "this is done for the first time using the measured velocity dispersion function from sdss although we compare and reproduce the results of orm using the inferred velocity dispersion function .",
    "in addition , we consider the effect of incomplete lensing information on the retrieval of cosmological parameters with a new nested monte carlo method .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we define the lens - redshift test and compare the use of the ivdf and the mvdf on the determination of both @xmath6 and galaxy evolution parameters . in section 3",
    "we describe the new expanded sample and , in section 4 , we present the results of the application of the lens - redshift test to our sample .",
    "we present a new monte carlo method to quantify the effect of incomplete lensing information in section 5 , by constructing realizations of several biased subsamples .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our results and their implication for future observational surveys .",
    "we follow the notation introduced by tog and k92 in defining the optical depth to lensing and the lens - redshift test , respectively . the differential optical depth to lensing per unit",
    "redshift is the differential probability @xmath20 that a line of sight intersects a lens at redshift @xmath8 in traversing the path @xmath21 from a population of lensing galaxies with comoving number density @xmath22 .",
    "mathematically , for a source this is simply the ratio of the differential light travel distance @xmath23 to its mean free path between successive encounters with galaxies @xmath24 ,    @xmath25    where the comoving number density of lensing galaxies is given by @xmath26 ; @xmath17 is the average number density of lensing galaxies ; @xmath27 is the cross section for multiple imaging of a background point source ; @xmath28 is the hubble radius and @xmath29 .",
    "the cross section for multiple imaging @xmath27 is given by @xmath30 we initially assume @xmath17 , the characteristic luminosity @xmath31 and the characteristic velocity dispersion @xmath16 of lensing galaxies to be constant with redshift , although we will later relax this assumption and allow for time evolution .",
    "our analysis is restricted to early - type and s0 galaxies as lenses and it is assumed that they can be modelled as singular isothermal spheres ( sis ) . , where @xmath32 is constant with radius @xmath7 .",
    "this density profile is a very good fit for elliptical and s0 lensing galaxies .",

    "the value of @xmath46 depends on @xmath16 , which in turn varies as a function of the morphological type considered .",

    "following orm , our first lens sample is primarily drawn from the castles ( mu~ noz et al . 1998 )",

    "we ignore the 13 class b binary quasars from the castles lists , eight of which have image separations greater than 4  and would be discarded as likely being cluster - assisted rather than due to field galaxies . in the remaining 5 lenses nearby group galaxies",
    "are implicated in determining the separations , therefore we discard them as well .    to get",
    "a handle on potential biases in the sample we have grouped the systems by their discovery technique into three categories : targeted optical discoveries , which were targets selected based on the lensed source optical emission and includes such surveys as the first hst snapshot survey ( maoz et al .",
    "1993 ) and quasars selected from the calan - tololo ( maza et al .",
    "1996 ) , hamburg - eso ( wisotzki et al . 2000 ) and sdss quasar surveys ( york et al .",
    "2000 ) ; targeted radio discoveries , which were targets selected based on the lensed source s radio properties and includes the jvas / class ( myers et al .",
    "2003 ) , pmn ( winn et al .",
    "2002 ) , and mg ( bennett et al . 1986 ) lens searches ; and miscellaneous discoveries for systems discovered either serendipitously ( such as the hst parallel field discoveries ; ratnatunga , griffiths & ostrander 1999 ) or based on system properties other than that of the lensed source and typically that of the lensing galaxy .    lenses discovered based on the properties of the source ought not to harbour a bias in terms of the redshift of the lensing galaxy , although they suffer from magnification bias .",
    "however , systems discovered because of the lens or surrounding environment will naturally favour low - redshift lenses .",
    "all systems in the ` miscellaneous discoveries ' fall under this category , which includes systems discovered because of the properties of the lensing galaxy such as q2237 + 030 ( huchra et al .",
    "1985 ) and cfrs03.1077 ( crampton et al . 2002 ) , systems discovered based on properties of the lensing galaxy s environment such as rxj0921 + 4529 ( mu~ noz et al .",
    "1998 ) , and systems discovered serendipitously from hst pointings such as the hst medium deep survey lensing candidates ( ratnatunga , griffiths & ostrander 1999 ) and hdfs2232509 - 603243 ( barkana , blandford & hogg 1999 ) , the latter of which are characterised by deflector emission that is either comparable to or dominates over the background source .",
    "we also exclude systems inappropriate for our lens model of isolated and elliptical / s0 lensing galaxies . these include systems with multiple lensing galaxies of comparable luminosities ( and therefore likely comparable halo masses ) such as he0230 - 2130 ( wisotzki et al .",
    "1998 ) , b1359 + 154 ( myers et al . 1999 ) and b2114 + 022 ( augusto et al . 2001 ) .",
    "we also exclude cluster - assisted systems such as q0957 + 561 ( young et al .",
    "1980 ) .",
    "although we are ignoring entire surveys , this ought not to introduce biases in the sample . these various cuts detailed above",
    "leave a total of 42 systems in our * sample a1 * detailed in table a1 with complete redshift information ( source and lens redshifts ) . we have estimated the size of the deflector s critical radius for the remaining systems using a simple singular isothermal sphere model ( sis ) plus external shear using the gravlens software of keeton ( 2001 ) .",
    "relative image positions with respect to the lensing galaxy were obtained from either the castles compilation or from the reference in column ( 11 ) of table a1 in the appendix . for double systems",
    ", we use the reddest flux ratio measured between lensed components ( typically either hst / f160w or the radio flux ratio if the system is radio - loud ) as the fifth constraint required by the model , which ought to minimize flux ratio contamination from microlensing - induced variability . for systems with ring morphology",
    ", the critical radius of the lens was obtained from the corresponding model reported in the cited reference .",
    "finally , we add the slacs lenses ( bolton et al . 2006 ) to construct our largest sample comprising seventy systems .",
    "the slacs survey has proven to be a very efficient hst snapshot imaging survey for new galaxy - scale strong lenses .",
    "the targeted lens candidates were selected by bolton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) from the sdss database of galaxy spectra for having multiple nebular emission lines at a redshift significantly higher than that of the target sdss galaxy .",
    "the survey is optimized to detect bright early - type lens galaxies with faint lensed sources .",
    "the key advantage of this selection technique is that it provides a homogeneously selected sample of bright early - type lens galaxies .",
    "however , given the size of the fibres in sdss this sample is biased toward large separations ( the consequences of this bias are discussed later ) compared to other surveys .",
    "this is clearly seen in the histogram plotted in fig .  1",
    ". all the 28 slacs lenses found to date are tabulated in table a2 of the appendix .",
    "of these lenses 19 are confirmed with multiple images and the remaining 9 lenses are candidates .",
    "we note here that both the confirmed and unconfirmed candidates from the slacs are included in our calculations .",
    "although the slacs is a biased sample , we include all 28 lenses in our analysis to illustrate the effect of better statistics given the success of the adopted selection strategy .",
    "the slacs selection favours gravitational lenses that have typically larger einstein radii ( as seen clearly in the histogram of image separations in fig .",
    "1 ) by virtue of the selection of spectroscopic candidates for imaging follow - up . for the purposes of the current analysis it clearly strengthens the results of this work , i.e. biased sampling of the image separation distribution provides biased values for galaxy evolution parameters .",
    "once the survey has finished , the selection function will be very well determined , which will enable more careful use of this sample for galaxy evolution studies .",
    "this strategy has been extremely successful so we feel compelled to showcase this sample .",
    "slacs e / s0 lenses appear to be a random sub - sample of the luminous red galaxies sample of the sdss , only skewed toward the brighter and higher surface brightness systems .",
    "while the environments of some of the lenses are complicated by the existence of nearby galaxies , by and large it is a ` clean ' sample where the image separations are determined primarily by a single elliptical / s0 lens .",
    "including the 28 slacs lenses to the sample a1 gives us a final tally of 70 lenses , all with complete information , that defines our * sample a2*. in fig .  1 , we plot the distribution of critical radii for observed lenses in sample a1 and the slacs lenses , which together constitute our sample a2 .",
    "since several samples will be used in the paper , we list them here for clarity : * sample a1 - our updated version of the orm sample i , with a total of 42 systems ; sample a2 - our new , enlarged sample that contains sample a1 and 28 new slacs lenses ; sample b - our mock sample of a 100 lenses with complete information ; and sample c : our truncated sample a1 with 10% of the largest separation lenses removed . *",
    "in this section , we compare the discriminating power of the mvdf versus the ivdf , in constraining both cosmological and galaxy evolution parameters .",
    "we study the recovery bias in the extraction of ( i ) cosmological constraints with @xmath68 for the various compiled lens samples , as well as of ( ii ) galaxy evolution parameters , by fixing the cosmological parameters .",
    "finally , we assess the impact of incompleteness of lens data in the recovery of the cosmological constant .",
    "as noted in section 2 , we normalise the lens - redshift probability distribution with respect to the optical depth @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , parameters which appear simply as multiplying constants in the distributions do not impact our comparison .",
    "such parameters include the hubble radius @xmath28 and the average number density of lensing galaxies @xmath17 ( ivdf ) and @xmath69 ( mvdf ) .",

    "recent results from the slacs survey suggest that @xmath71 , i.e. the lens model velocity dispersions are fairly close to the measured stellar velocity dispersion within an effective radius ( treu et al .",

    "we can substitute the faber - jackson exponent @xmath75 and characteristic @xmath16 with the corresponding tully - fisher relation parameters .",
    "although late - type galaxies are more numerous than early - type galaxies , they tend to have lower masses and therefore do not contribute significantly to the total optical depth to lensing .",
    "due to the strong dependence of the lensing cross section on the velocity dispersion , this causes late - type galaxies in general to be inefficient lenses .",
    "besides , late - type galaxies are not included in the determination of the mvdf from sdss data .",
    "so in this work , for consistent comparisons we restrict ourselves to elliptical and s0 lenses .",
    "we compute the differential optical depth @xmath89 for each individual lens with measured separation and known source redshift for our two samples : sample a1 ( 42 lenses ) and sample a2 ( 70 lenses ) .",
    "we then determine the probability distribution of the redshift of the lens using equation ( 7 ) ( ivdf ) and equation ( 13 ) ( mvdf ) , given the observed image separation ; the measured source redshift ; a given cosmology and galaxy evolution model ( in this case assuming no evolution : @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath13 , @xmath74 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "if the choice of underlying cosmological parameters , primarily @xmath6 in this case , corresponds to the true value , the peak of the probability distribution @xmath92 ought to be close to the measured lens redshift @xmath93 , in a good number of cases .",

    "the plot illustrates that the mvdf and ivdf yield near identical probability distributions for the lens redshifts .",
    "choosing different values of @xmath6 shifts these inferred probability distributions : this is illustrated in fig .  2 for one lens ( b0218 + 357 ) , for values of @xmath94 ( keeping @xmath74 ) .",
    "however , we notice a systematic effect : @xmath92 the peak redshift of the probability distribution is skewed slightly lower for the mvdf compared to the ivdf for almost the entire sample a2 . this can be qualitatively explained as arising due to the different asymptotic behaviours of the mvdf and the ivdf ( see fig .",

    "the likelihood estimator @xmath102 for the entire sample of @xmath103 systems is then :        we then compute the maximum value of @xmath102 , fixing the galaxy evolution parameters to obtain constraints on the cosmology ( @xmath105 ) , and then fixing the cosmology to obtain constraints on galaxy evolution ( @xmath106 ) .    as pointed out by orm",
    ", the lens - redshift test is more sensitive to the galaxy mass evolution parameter @xmath56 compared to the galaxy number evolution parameter @xmath54 .",
    "this can be understood by considering the limit when @xmath107 : a negative @xmath56 decreases the most probable value for the lens redshift and narrows the probability distribution .",
    "in contrast , the number evolution parameter only affects the peak value but does not affect the overall shape of the probability distribution .",

    "this value is determined by taking the median as the central value and `` ruling out '' the leftmost @xmath112% and rightmost @xmath112% of the total integral ( ` median ' method ) . alternatively ,",
    "if we take the mode as the central value and determine the threshold value of the likelihood for which the integral under it comprises @xmath113% of the total integral ( ` mode ' method ) , we obtain a slightly higher value of @xmath114 ; this method is similar to what orm did , except that they assumed a normal distribution ( ` normal ' method ) .",

    "even with the improvement of using the mvdf compared to earlier work , the sensitivity to @xmath6 in the lens - redshift test is low , as seen clearly by the fact that using the @xmath122 range on @xmath63 recovers values of @xmath6 varying from 0.0 to nearly 1.0 - the full available range .",

    "a1 in the appendix .",
    "a marked difference between the ivdf and mvdf shows up in the velocity range of 380400 @xmath123 , which is characteristic of cd galaxies .",
    "strong lensing events from such galaxies are difficult to model , as their position at the centre of clusters causes the events to be assisted by additional smoothly distributed dark matter in their vicinity . since we excluded all such systems in our sample a1",
    ", it is not surprising that the inferred value of the cosmological constant using the ivdf and mvdf are in good agreement .",

    "we find that the recovered value of @xmath6 is higher from the sample a2 ( the mode value is shifted by about 0.25 ) .",
    "sample a2 does include a higher proportion of larger separation lenses ( clearly seen in fig .  1 ) .",
    "this indicates a potential systematic bias that skews recovery of @xmath6 , that is sensitive to how well the ` true ' separation distribution is sampled . to obtain robust constraints on @xmath6 with the lens - redshift test not only",
    "do we need large samples but we also need lenses that accurately reflect the true underlying distribution of image separations .",
    "we note here that the slacs lenses are included to clearly demonstrate this bias as their image separations are skewed to larger values as a consequence of the selection technique .",
    "four key results emerge from these plots : first , the lens - redshift test is not very robust in constraining the value of the cosmological constant with current samples .",
    "this was already suggested by k92 , but we demonstrate it more clearly here even with two notable improvements : a larger sample of lenses and the use of the mvdf .",
    "the likelihood curve is very shallow and consequently the error bars are rather large .",
    "second , the mvdf and ivdf results are comparable , therefore the inefficacy of the lens - redshift test does not appear to stem from systematics arising from the use of the ivdf .",
    "third , is the notable sensitivity of constraints on @xmath6 to the parameter @xmath127 .",
    "the value of @xmath127 emerges in the fit of a functional form to the observed velocity dispersion function and depends on the completeness of the measurement , i.e. adequate sampling of the high and low velocity dispersion tail for observed galaxies .",
    "finally , inclusion of the slacs lenses ( 19 confirmed lenses + 9 candidates ) with relatively larger separations pushes the recovered @xmath6 to higher values .",
    "the finite number of lens systems is clearly implicated here as evidenced in the error bars on @xmath6 and is a key limitation . in conclusion , as we show in the next section , while a large number of lens systems will go a ways toward increasing the robustness of this test in the future , it is crucial to simultaneously sample the separation distribution uniformly .",
    "we now investigate galaxy evolution using the lens - redshift test , with @xmath17 , @xmath31 , @xmath16 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 varying with redshift according to equations ( 8) , ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) and their primed versions .",
    "the equations used are ( 11 ) and ( 14 ) . fixing the cosmological model to @xmath91 , @xmath13 , @xmath74 and @xmath12 ,",
    "we determine @xmath56 and @xmath54 .",
    "as outlined in section 4.1 , the likelihood function is constructed fixing @xmath6 and then maximizing to obtain constraints on @xmath56 and @xmath54 .",
    "we obtain constraints on @xmath56 and @xmath54 for various samples : the orm sample i lenses , sample a1 and sample a2 all of which are plotted in fig .  5 .",
    "we calculate the @xmath56-@xmath54 contours for the orm sample i , applying our analysis methods and using the mvdf .",
    "the mvdf was not available at the time of the orm analysis .",
    "our calculation of the @xmath56 and @xmath54 parameters using the ivdf is in very good agreement with their results .",
    "the orientation and calibration of the confidence level contours agree . although the contours of all the samples overlap quite well , the difference in the peak values of @xmath56 and @xmath54 determined for our samples a1 , a2 and orm sample i is significant .",
    "the likelihood results in the @xmath56-@xmath54 plane for sample a1 , using the ivdf and the mvdf , are shown in the upper and the lower panels of fig .  5 , respectively .",
    "we obtain a maximum in @xmath102 at \\{@xmath128 , @xmath129 } for the ivdf and at \\{@xmath130 , @xmath131 } for the mvdf , again showing no significant dependence on the choice of velocity dispersion function employed .",
    "however , we note that the contours close along the @xmath56-axis for the mvdf case compared to the ivdf .",
    "therefore , using the ivdf to calculate the likelihood lowers the sensitivity to mass evolution . for our sample",
    "a2 the maximum value for @xmath102 is at \\{@xmath132 , @xmath133 } for the ivdf and at \\{@xmath134 , @xmath135 } for the mvdf . for the orm sample",
    "i : the maximum value for @xmath102 is found to lie at \\{@xmath136 , @xmath137 } for the ivdf and at \\{@xmath138 , @xmath139 } for the mvdf .",
    "the likelihood peak moves toward increasingly positive values of u for sample a2 compared to a1 and the orm sample i. this indicates a strong sensitivity to the fraction of large separation lenses .",
    "sample a2 has a larger proportion of those and therefore predicts stronger mass evolution for the lens ensemble .",
    "the fact that @xmath56 and @xmath54 have opposite signs is consistent with mass conservation : we have either a larger number of lower mass galaxies ( @xmath140 , @xmath141 ) or fewer more massive galaxies ( @xmath142 , @xmath143 ) in the past compared to today . however , the case ( @xmath142 , @xmath143 ) is in conflict with the currently accepted hierarchical model of galaxy formation with bottom - up assembly of structure .",
    "our primary conclusions on deriving galaxy evolution parameters are : ( i ) we reproduce the trends reported by orm for their sample i when we use the ivdf as they did ; ( ii ) we find the likelihood peak position to be insensitive to the choice of ivdf vs mvdf for the orm sample i ; ( iii ) we recover @xmath56 and @xmath54 values consistent within the errors for all our samples ; ( iv ) with a larger number of lenses ( as in sample a2 ) we obtain slightly increased sensitivity to @xmath54 compared to orm sample i ; ( v ) the likelihood peak shifts systematically to higher @xmath56 values for sample a2 which contains a higher proportion of large separation lenses compared to the sample a1 .",
    "to summarise , there is a notable observational bias in recovering mass evolution that depends strongly on how well the underlying true separation distribution is sampled in detected lenses .",
    "axis is shown here for several values of the characteristic velocity dispersion @xmath63 for the full sample a2 using the mvdf .",
    "the numbers denote the characteristic velocity dispersion in @xmath123 , increasing in value from the top down as indicated by the arrows . for for @xmath117 ( black thick line )",
    ", we obtain @xmath126 .",
    "the likelihood curves are very shallow and consequently the error bars are rather large .",
    "the sample a2 clearly yields values of @xmath6 that are systematically higher than sample a1.,width=226 ]          unbiased lens surveys are needed to sample uniformly the full distribution of separations ( kochanek 1993 ) in order to apply the lens - redshift test to constrain galaxy evolution parameters as found above . if the sample is slightly skewed toward larger separations , biased values of the galaxy evolution parameters are retrieved . to investigate this issue further",
    ", we create a mock sample of a hundred lenses ( * sample b * ) , all with complete information ( i.e. source redshift , lens redshift , and image separation ) known assuming no evolution , to try and understand the observational biases that likely affect our analysis .",
    "we randomly assign the source redshift from a normal distribution of redshifts centred at @xmath144 and with a dispersion of 1 .",
    "we then randomly assign the angular critical radius , as half of the lens separation , from the probability distribution of image separations given by kochanek ( 1993 ) , where we set @xmath145 and @xmath146 in their equation ( 4.10 ) for a flat universe .",
    "we calculate the differential optical depth distribution for each lens , using equation ( 7 ) , and randomly pick a lens redshift from it .            for the full mock catalogue ( sample b ) ,",
    "the maximum value for the likelihood @xmath102 is obtained at \\{@xmath147 , @xmath148}. the input @xmath149 parameters values are not exactly recovered due to finite - sample variance .",
    "several subsamples of sample b were then evaluated , after cutting the sample based on source redshifts and image separations . creating a subsample of 90 lenses discarding the 10 highest source redshift systems , we find that the maximum value of the likelihood @xmath102 shifts to \\{@xmath150 , @xmath151}. then for a subsample of 90 lenses generated by discarding the 10 lowest source redshift systems we find that the peak is at \\{@xmath147 , @xmath152}.    to examine the additional sensitivity to the number of lenses as well , we now construct a subsample from sample b of 58 lenses with the lowest source redshifts and find \\{@xmath138 , @xmath153 } and for the subsample of 58 lenses with the highest source redshifts the evolution parameters are found to be \\{@xmath154 , @xmath155}. these results are shown in the lower panel of fig .  6 :",
    "no significant systematic bias is introduced on selection by source redshift .",
    "the only difference seen in these subsamples is the effect of the variation in the number of systems : the contours are more extended for the 2 cases with 58 systems compared to the cases with 90 systems .",
    "we then cull sample b on the basis of image separations and the results for these subsamples are shown in the upper panel of fig .  6 .",
    "the key systematic that we study in further detail is the role of biased sampling of the image separation distribution .",
    "the mock catalogue generated above was now cut based on lens angular critical radius @xmath7 .",
    "once again biased subsamples were generated to preferentially sample larger and smaller separation systems .",
    "first , we constructed a subsample of 90 systems discarding 10 smallest separation systems : for this instance the maximum value of the likelihood lies at \\{@xmath147 , @xmath156}. picking now a further 90 systems discarding the 10 largest separation systems , we find a different maximum at \\{@xmath154 , @xmath157}. similarly , making a more extreme selection , we pick 58 systems from the mock discarding 42 of the largest separation systems .",
    "this is our extreme biased sample skewed to small separations . for this subsample",
    "we find \\{@xmath158 , @xmath159}. finally , for a mock with 58 of the largest separation lenses ( this constitutes our extreme biased sample toward large separations ) we find \\{@xmath160 , @xmath161}. our analysis clearly indicates the presence of a systematic bias introduced on selection by lens separation .",
    "this effect is especially seen clearly in the smaller subsamples ( with 58 systems ) . in particular ,",
    "the velocity dispersion evolution parameter dramatically shifts from near - zero values ( @xmath162 ) to negative values ( @xmath163 ) , when the highest separation lenses are removed from the sample .",
    "we see clearly from fig .",
    "6 that lens data comprising biased sampling of the underlying image separation distribution introduce a systematic shift in the recovered values of the galaxy evolution parameters , whereas data with biased source redshifts yield unbiased estimates of @xmath56 and @xmath54 .",
    "galaxy evolution parameters are thus extremely sensitive to observational biases in the separation distribution of lens systems . for ground based optical surveys and high resolution hst surveys",
    "there are optimal separations that are detected .",
    "lens systems found in ground based surveys are likely skewed to larger separations than those found in hst surveys .",
    "having narrowed the plausible source of the systematic bias , we re - do the analysis making a similar cut on our observed lens sample a1 to verify our finding .",
    "we remove the five ( 10% ) largest image separation lenses thus creating the * sample c*. we now compare the recovery of @xmath56 and @xmath54 for this biased sample with samples a1 and a2 , sample b and the orm sample i. the maximum value of @xmath102 is obtained for sample c at \\{@xmath147 , @xmath164 } ( ivdf ) and at \\{@xmath165 , @xmath166 } ( mvdf ) . in table 1",

    "the resultant trend clearly demonstrates the strong bias now replicated with cuts in the data introduced by artificially removing large image separation systems . our result",
