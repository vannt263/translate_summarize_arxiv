    "both of these snrs have radii @xmath520 pc ( table  [ tab : snrs ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the other four snrs have radii of @xmath15 pc .",
    "thus , surface brightness becomes more of an issue for these larger remnants , and may well put them under the upper limits for detection in most wavebands ( table  [ tab : flux ] ) .",
    "the lack of detectable emission from the n206 snr is particularly notable in light of the absence of pah emission in that area of the n206  region , as noted by @xcite .",
    "we expect the environments of these snrs to also have a strong influence on their detections ( or lack thereof ) . to show substantial dust emission would require the presence of dense clouds interacting with the snr .",
    "there is no evidence for the presence of such dust clouds in the immediate vicinity of the n206 snr ; in n44 , the optically - obscuring  arm \" suggests at least some dense concentrations , but not sufficient for shock - heated dust to raise the snr s ir surface brightness over the background .",
    "the detection of weak emission from n11l at 4.5  and n157b at 3.6 and 4.5  are likely to be due to line emission from these remnants .",
    "neither snr is discernable in the dust - sensitive 8.0  band ; the shorter - wavelength bands , in general , are dominated by ionic and ( especially ) molecular line emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in n11l , the 4.5",
    "morphology closely traces the snr limb and filament structures seen in optical emission lines . in n157b",
    "the 3.6 and 4.5  emission are enhanced over the region where optical filaments are brightest , and in particular match the morphology of a pair of bright optical filaments .",
    "the relative prominence of the 4.5  band , in both cases , suggests that br@xmath1 4.1  may be a strong contributor to the ir emission .",
    "n49 is bright at all of the wavelengths observed to date by _",
    "spitzer_. this may be a result , in part , from n49 s interaction with a molecular cloud to its southeast . in this",
    ", it is similar to the galactic snr ic443 , which is also interacting with a nearby molecular cloud , and is bright at a wide range of infrared wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the irs observation of n49 confirms the presence of numerous strong ionic lines , as well as several lines probably originating from h@xmath0 transitions . the snr does not appear to be dominated by pah / vsg emission , as we would expect pah - dominated emission to be strongest in the 8  band , while in fact the emission there is somewhat closer to background levels than at 3.6 or 4.5",
    "the lack of pah emission could be accounted for by , e.g. , pah destruction by far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation from the shock precursor of n49 , which is known to have fairly rapid expansion velocities @xcite .",
    "we then consider whether thermal emission from dust , as well as line emission , makes up a significant part of the ir emission from n49 .",
    "the emission in the irac bands only traces the brightest optical filaments , which also show up strongly in the mips 24 and 70  bands .",
    "these bright filaments most probably are the source of the emission measured in the irs spectra , which indicate a number of strong emission lines . the continuum levels of the post - bcd spectra appear to be very close to zero , strongly suggesting a lack of substantial continuum emission from hot dust .",
    "we therefore argue that line emission is the dominant component of the mid / far infrared emission from the bright filaments which are the dominant source of emission from n49 .",
    "while we can not rule out additional contributions from hot dust , this lack of continuum emission indicates that such contributions are comparatively minor .",
    "notably , however , the 24  emission ( only ) also shows the complete snr shell of n49 , including the west side which is largely undetectable in optical emission lines .",
    "the spectroscopy of n49 shows the presence of several lines within the bandwidth of the 24  image ( @xmath16 ) , including an [ ] line at 23.0 , [ ] lines at 24.5 and 26.0 , and an [ ] line at 25.9 .",
    "the 25.9 and 26.0  lines are both considerably brighter than any of the lines which fall within the irac bands .",
    "thus it is plausible that the source of the 24  emission from the snr shell may be primarily line emission .    to quantify this estimate further , we summed the expected fluxes of the lines listed above , which , over the 111 @xmath6 223 area of the slit , gave a total flux of 2.2@xmath17 erg @xmath14 s@xmath8 . on the mips 24  image , we created an 111 @xmath6 223 region at approximately the same sky location and orientation as the placement of the irs long - high slit .",
    "we summed over the surface brightness of this region of the mips image , without background subtraction ( since the irs flux estimates included both source and background ) , and obtained a total flux of 2.8@xmath18 erg @xmath14 s@xmath8 .",
    "thus , based on these rough estimates , line emission could be responsible for almost 80% of the mips 24  emission from n49 .",
    "note , however , that in addition to the statistical errors given , this estimate is subject to uncertainties in the calibrations of mips and irs , particularly given the unknown background contribution to the irs spectra .",
    "it is also quite possible that this estimate applies only to the comparatively ir - bright eastern region , and can not be meaningfully applied to the rest of the limb , particularly the areas seen only at 24 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the flux density of thermal emission from hot dust is proportional to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the planck function , @xmath21 is an efficiency factor for the infrared emissivity , and @xmath22 is the dust temperature . for metals and crystalline grains in the mid / far - ir , @xmath23 ; typical dust temperatures from a young snr are @xmath24 k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "plotting this expected curve for the irac and mips wavebands , we see that the curve peaks in the 24  band .",
    "the curve predicts that the next highest flux density , in the 8  band , will be @xmath25 fainter than that at 24 . since the 24  surface brightness of the northwest limb of n49 is relatively faint ( @xmath26 above local background ) , it is quite plausible that emission ten times fainter would not be detected",
    ".      for snrs within  regions , such as n63a , there may be sufficient far - ultraviolet radiation to destroy nearby pahs .",
    "in fact , the shell ( limb ) of n63a is largely undetectable in any of the irac wavebands , which as we have noted above are most sensitive to pah emission . at 24 ,",
    "however , the complete shell of n63a ( also seen in the x - ray and radio regimes ) is apparent .",
    "the radio and ir coincidence might result from a significant synchrotron component in the ir .",
    "however , extrapolating the radio spectrum for n63a @xcite to 24   gives an expected flux density of 6 mjy at that wavelength , less than 1% of the observed flux density .",
    "thus , we take the strong x - ray and ir correspondence as an indication that line emission again dominates in the shell at 24 . as with n49 , this does not wholly preclude the presence of a hot dust component .",
    "however , the lack of optical emission again suggests a low - density environment ( other than in the three - lobed nebula ) and therefore that the region lacks the necessary dense clumps for significant dust emission .",
    "in contrast , the three - lobed nebular region of n63a is apparent at all available wavelengths , most brightly in the western ( photoionized ) lobe .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the entire snr , which is dominated by this central nebula , appears similar to that of n49 . while it is plausible that these high - density regions in n63a may have similar emission properties to the high - density filaments of n49 , more detailed spectroscopy is required to probe the dominant processes producing the infrared emission .",
    "when the lobes are considered separately , their seds are similar to one another overall ; surprisingly , the seds of the southeastern ( shocked ) lobe and the western ( photoionized ) lobe have almost identical spectral shapes , while the northeastern ( shocked ) lobe has an sed slightly divergent from those of the other two ( fig .",
    "[ fig : seds ] ) . given that the optical data suggest that the western lobe is an unshocked  region while the eastern lobes are shocked by the snr , it is surprising to find that the northeastern lobe , rather than the western lobe , shows the greatest difference from the other two lobes .",

    "x - ray image for each snr to match the corresponding 24  image . each x - ray and",

    "the resulting normalization factors were @xmath27 ct s@xmath8 arcsecs@xmath28 and 63 mjy sr@xmath8 for n49 , and @xmath29 ct s@xmath8 arcsecs@xmath28 and 206 mjy sr@xmath8 for n63a .",
    "we then divided the 24  images by the x - ray images in order to produce ratio maps ( not shown ) , which give the distribution of 24  emission ( with respect to the 24   peak ) compared to the x - ray emission ( with respect to the x - ray peak ) .",
    "if we then consider an  infrared excess \" to be present where these ratio maps show ratios greater than 1.0 , and if we consider that regions dominated by thermal emission from dust should show such an  infrared excess , \" then we can , by integrating over such regions , estimate a rough proportion of the total emission which , we presume , is due to continuum emission from dust . for n49 , roughly three - quarters of the flux",
    "could then be attributed to continuum emission !

    "however , this somewhat simplistic approach must be treated with caution .",
    "@xcite used the fact that that the strongest x - ray emission in 1e 0102.2 - 7219 was associated with reverse - shocked ejecta in that young snr , a region which would be expected to generate strong line emission in many wavelength regimes .",
    "in contrast , n49 and n63a are both older remnants , in which the ejecta is probably intermixed with swept - up ism to a large extent",
    ". for both these snrs , some regions identified as having an  infrared excess \" are also sites of significant optical line emission - including parts of the southeastern limb of n49 and the  three - lobed nebula \" of n63a .",
    "ir emission associated with optically - emitting was suggested by @xcite to include significant infrared line emission !",
    "other regions , such as the western side of n49 and the southwestern limb of n63a ( the  x - ray loops \" ) , probably lack significant optical emission because that region of the snr is expanding into a low - density environment .",
    "this raises the point that we would not expect the high - density clouds required to produce substantial thermal dust emission in such regions .",
    "@xcite , in their study of galactic snrs , were able to measure fluxes for a number of those snrs in all four irac bands .",
    "based on measurements and simple models , the authors developed an irac color - color diagram showing the regions of  color space \" expected for different emission mechanisms , including pah , ionic , molecular and synchrotron emission .",
    "they found little evidence of synchrotron emission for their detected snrs ; and state that  observations of infrared emission from snrs to date have shown little or no evidence of significant dust emission ( pah or continuum ) within the wavelengths of the irac bands . \" from their sample , they identified regions within the snrs with colors typical of emission from molecular lines , ionic lines , and pahs .",
    "a number of their detected snrs showed significant molecular - line emission ; several of these have other signs of molecular cloud interaction , such as maser emission .",
    "n49 and n63a are the only snrs in this sample for which all four irac bands are available . using n49",

    "we see from the ionic and molecular lines identified by _ spitzer",
    "_  irs spectroscopy ( table  [ tab : irslines ] ) that this is indeed an accurate characterization for n49 .",
    "@xcite notes that both ctb  37a and g348.5@xmath70.0 are associated with oh 1720 masers , which strongly suggests that these remnants are interacting with molecular clouds , as n49 is thought to be .",
    "all lobes of the three - lobed nebula in n63a have colors ( table  [ tab : n63flux ] ) that place them within the  molecular shock \" portion of the diagram , suggesting that shocked molecular gas dominates at the near - ir wavelengths .",
    "the point that line emission is often a substantial contributor to the infrared emission from snrs has been raised for some time ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for instance , @xcite found that infrared line emission from shocked gas contributes  a significant fraction \" to one component of the infrared emission - the component generally traced by the presence of optical emission .",
    "( note that dust emission was also thought to contribute to this component , and that a second ir component , traced by an excess of ir to x - ray emission , was inferred to be generated only by collisionally heated dust . )",
    "more recently , @xcite find that for the small magellanic cloud snr 1e 0102.2 - 7219 , emission from the [ ] line may contribute up to 60% of the 24  emission .",
    "our observations of these remnants have primarily shown infrared emission , where present , arising from optically - bright areas of the snrs .",
    "the implication is that line emission is a significant contributor to the infrared emission of these remnants .",
    "the irac - band ratios of @xcite for the optical / ir - bright areas in n63 and n49 also indicate substantial contributions from ionic and molecular lines .",
    "this suggestion is greatly strengthened by the infrared spectroscopy of the optically - bright limb of n49 , where the line contributions appear to overwhelmingly dominate the infrared flux density .",
    "perhaps the most interesting ( and mysterious ) result is that for our two clearest detections , n49 and n63a , the outer limb of the snr ( in both cases , extremely faint in optical emission lines ) is detected clearly at 24  but not in the other wavebands .",
    "@xcite find a similar result for 1e 0102.2 - 7219 ; the snr is detected clearly at 24 , but not at 8 or 70 .",
    "similarly , @xcite , in a study of type ia snrs in the large magellanic cloud , find that none of their four snrs are detected in the irac bands ; two are detected at 24 and 70 , and two at 24  alone .",
    "the comparative brightness of emission from these snrs in the 24  band , compared to the other ir bands , may be due in part to the line emission from [ ] and [ ] , particularly in regions of bright optical emission .",
    "however , we are far from able to rule out a secondary dust component even in these regions . the areas of strong 24  emission , weak optical emission , and moderate x - ray emission may point to a very different physical case , where ir emission from collisionally heated dust may yet predominate .",
    "our future spectral mapping of n49 and n63a with _",
    "s irs are expected to elucidate this situation .",
    "the potentially significant contributions of infrared line emission from at least some snrs has serious implications for the calculations of the dust content within those snrs , and the use of such calculations to constrain models of dust production and destruction .",
    "for example , dust mass estimates based on the 24  _ spitzer_flux or the 25  _ iras _  flux may overestimate the amount of dust due to overestimation of the flux resulting from inclusion of line emission .",
    "for some remnants , e.g. where nonradiative shocks dominate , this difference may be only slight , but for highly radiative snrs , particularly those interacting with dense ambient material , the effect may be significant .",
    "likewise , fits to seds may be unphysical if line contributions in one or more bands are not properly taken into account .",
