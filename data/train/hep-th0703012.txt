    "the generation of a nearly scale invariant spectrum of primordial perturbations , as observed in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) @xcite or large scale structure ( lss ) surveys @xcite , is a decisive indicator of an inflationary epoch in the early universe . during inflation @xcite , an accelerated expansion of the early universe , perturbations are stretched beyond the hubble radius and",
    "re - enter the late universe , making them observable to us , e.g. in the cmbr .    a potential approach to discriminating between inflationary models",
    "consist of measuring deviations from purely gaussian statistics ; most simple models of inflation predict quasi scale invariant , nearly gaussian , adiabatic perturbations .",
    "however , more intricate models such as multi - field inflationary ones ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) , might deviate from gaussianity .",
    "henceforth , a consideration of higher order correlation functions , such as the bispectrum or trispectrum , could potentially shed light into the fundamental physics responsible for generating primordial fluctuations @xcite .",
    "a rough estimate of non - gaussianities , as measured by the bispectrum , is the non - linearity parameter @xmath1 , properly defined later in the text .",
    "currently , primordial non - gaussian features in the cosmic microwave background radiation have not been detected .",
    "for instance , the observational bound on the non - linearity parameter obtained from the wmap3 data set alone is @xmath2 @xcite , and future experiments will improve upon it @xcite .",
    "hence , theoretical predictions for @xmath1 in well motivated inflationary models should be made before the increasingly improved observational data is available .",
    "all models of inflation predict , to a certain extent , some level of primordial non - gaussianity . in single - field models ,",
    "non - gaussianities are small , usually of the order of the slow roll parameters @xcite because fluctuations freeze out once their wavelength crosses the hubble radius . in multi - field models , however , the presence of multiple light degrees of freedom perpendicular to the adiabatic direction leads to the generation of isocurvature perturbations , which in turn allow the comoving curvature perturbation @xmath3 to evolve after horizon crossing ( hc ) .",
    "this leads to an additional source of potentially detectable non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "one such multi - field model is assisted inflation , which was originally proposed to relax fine tuning of potentials , ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; it relies on @xmath0 scalar fields , preferably uncoupled , which assist each other in driving an inflationary phase .",
    "even though each individual field may not be able to generate an extended period of inflation on its own , they can do so cooperatively .",
    "this phenomenological model is attractive , since super planckian initial values of the fields can be avoided @xcite if the number of fields is large .",
    "a string motivated implementation of assisted inflation is @xmath0-flation @xcite : here the many fields are identified with axions arising from some kklt compactification of type iib string theory @xcite .    although the existence of @xmath0-flation via a concrete construction has not been proven , it provides a test - bed for multi - field inflation .",
    "in @xcite it is argued , but not proven , that an effective quadratic potential for each field without cross couplings may be attainable . based on results of random matrix theory ,",
    "it is further argued in @xcite that the masses for the @xmath0 fields , originally considered identical in @xcite , would conform to the marenko - pastur ( mp ) distribution @xcite .",
    "this _ spectrum _ of masses is controlled by only two constants : the average mass and a parameter fixing the width / shape of the spectrum , which may be identified with the ratio of the number of axions to the total dimension of the moduli space in a given construction .",
    "the effect of this distribution on the power - spectrum has been computed in @xcite , yielding a slightly redder spectral index .",
    "non - gaussianities arising in multi - field inflation have been considered recently : the starting point is the three - point correlation function just after horizon crossing , which was first derived in @xcite .",
    "thereafter , one can evolve non - gaussianities via the ( non - linear ) @xmath4-formalism @xcite .- formalism @xcite , and needed to deal with higher order correlation functions . ]",
    "if the horizon - crossing ( hc ) approximation is used , models of assisted inflation become indistinguishable from their single - field analogs @xcite .",
    "this is easily understood since , by discarding the evolution of modes after horizon crossing , the main distinguishing feature of multi - field models is neglected . as a result ,",
    "the spectrum of scalar and tensor perturbations is exactly the same - flation , since there is no attractor solution for quadratic potentials , making @xmath0-flation sensitive to the initial field values  we come back to this issue later on . ] to the one generated by an effective single - field model @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on @xmath0-flation with an arbitrary , but large number of fields , so that the marenko - pastur distribution can be used .",
    "we consider narrow and broad mass spectra , extending the study of @xcite where the formalism employed in this study was developed ; its application , however , was limited to simple toy models .",
    "here , we analytically compute the non - linearity parameter @xmath1 without assuming the horizon crossing approximation , but within the slow roll approximation .",
    "a comparison with simple estimates as well as the hc - limit , which is re - derived for completeness , reveals that additional contributions due to the evolution of modes after horizon crossing are present , but their magnitude is limited to a few percent of the hc result .",
    "hereafter , we relax the slow roll approximation and argue that large , but possibly transient contributions to @xmath1 should be expected from faster rolling fields , which are however not expected during @xmath0-flation , since heavy fields should evolve slowly up until ( p)re - heating commences .",
    "nevertheless , an analytic method to retain the main physical effect of fields starting to roll faster during inflation is suggested : an effective single - field model with steps in its potential .",
    "the concrete outline is as follows : in section [ sec:1 ] we review @xmath0-flation , focusing on the evolution during slow roll . after that , we introduce non - gaussianities in section [ sec : ng ] and provide , for later reference , the horizon crossing results of the non - linearity parameters characterizing the bi- and trispectrum , section [ sec : ng_with_sr_hc ] . based on the formalism developed in @xcite",
    ", we estimate @xmath1 for narrow mass spectra in section [ sec : narrow ] , providing a simple approximation .",
    "then , we take general broad mass spectra , properly described by the mp - distribution , to compute @xmath1 without any additional approximations , section [ sec : broad ] . the resulting additional contributions to @xmath1 due to the evolution outside the horizon",
    "are discussed and compared to previous analytic approximations , section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "finally , we consider relaxing the slow roll condition in section [ sec : bsr ] , before we conclude in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we start by considering the action for @xmath0 scalar fields , @xmath5 which we assume to be responsible for driving an inflationary phase ( see e.g. @xcite for a review on multi - field inflation ) . the unperturbed volume expansion rate from an initial flat hypersurface at @xmath6 to a final uniform density hypersurface at @xmath7",
    "is given by refers to the number of scalar fields , whereas @xmath8 is the number of e - folds . ]",
    "@xmath9 where @xmath10 is the hubble parameter .    in @xmath0-flation @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath11 scalar fields that drive inflation are identified with axion fields . if one expands the periodic axion potentials around their minima all cross - couplings vanish @xcite .",
    "hence , in the vicinity of their minima , the fields have a potential of the form @xmath12 we arranged the fields according to the magnitude of their masses , that is @xmath13 if @xmath14 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath0-flation is a specific realization of assisted inflation @xcite , where the many scalar fields assist each other in driving an inflationary phase , so that no single scalar field needs to traverse a super - planckian stretch in field space .",
    "further , the spectrum of masses in ( [ potential ] ) , which were assumed to be equal in @xcite , can be evaluated more accurately by means of random matrix theory and was found by easther and mcallister to conform to the marenco - pastur ( mp ) law @xcite .",
    "this results in a probability for a given mass of @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 completely describe the distribution : @xmath17 is the average mass squared and @xmath16 controls the width and shape of the spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the smallest and largest mass are given by @xmath18 in @xmath0-flation , @xmath16 can be identified with the number of axions contributing to inflation divided by the total dimension of the moduli space ( khler , complex structure and dilaton ) in a given kklt compactification of type iib string theory @xcite .",
    "we carry out the remainder of this analysis by treating @xmath16 as a free parameter , but keeping in mind that @xmath19 is preferred , due to constraints arising from the renormalization of newton s constant @xcite .",
    "we will not need to specify @xmath17 , since it will cancel out ; however , its magnitude is of course constrained by the cobe normalization just as @xmath20 in chaotic inflation @xcite .    at this point",
    ", we introduce a convenient dimensionless mass parameter @xmath21 as well as the suitable short - hand notation @xmath22 expectation values with respect to the mp - distribution can then be evaluated via @xmath23 since @xmath24 will appear frequently in our analysis , we introduce a more convenient notation and define functions @xmath25 , namely @xmath26 where @xmath27 so that the expectation values become @xmath28 a few useful properties of the @xmath29-functions and analytic approximations can be found in appendix [ app1 ] .    ) , depending on @xmath16 and the dimensionless square mass @xmath30 , rescaled with the expectation value @xmath31 ( also dependent on @xmath16 ) : ( a ) 3d - plot for @xmath32 , ( b ) slices for @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ; the closer @xmath16 is to one , the broader the mass spectrum becomes .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    throughout most of the analysis , we restrict ourselves to the slow roll approximation . as explained above , @xmath0 fields contribute to the energy density of the universe through a separable potential . in this regime ,",
    "the dynamics of @xmath0-flation are as follows : firstly , note that the field equations and friedman equations can be written as @xmath36 here and in the following we set the reduced planck mass to @xmath37 .",
    "this approximation is valid if the slow roll parameters @xmath38 are small ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) and    @xmath41    holds .",
    "the number of e - folds of inflation becomes @xmath42 and the field equations can then be integrated to yield @xmath43 notice that this relationship between fields does not correspond to an attractor solution . as a result",
    ", predictions of @xmath0-flation can depend on initial conditions  admittedly , a less attractive feature of the proposal .",
    "there is another subtlety of @xmath0-flation : if the mass spectrum is broad , that is @xmath44 corresponding to the limit @xmath45 , the heavier fields will drop out of slow roll early , even as inflation continues ( this is the case for the preferred value of @xmath19 , corresponding to @xmath46 ) . the effect of these fields on non - gaussianities",
    "can not be estimated properly by using the @xmath4-formalism , which we employ in section [ sec : ng_with_sr_hc ] and [ sec : ng_no_hc ] .",
    "we come back to this issue in section [ sec : bsr ] .",
    "recent observations of e.g. the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) @xcite or the large scale structure of the universe @xcite made it possible to measure two point statistics of scalar perturbations to high accuracy .",
    "existing measurements are consistent with a gaussian spectrum , for which all odd correlation functions vanish , while the even ones can be expressed in terms of the two point function . for instance , the non - linearity parameter @xmath1 , a measure of the three point function or bispectrum , is constraint to lie between @xmath2 by the wmap3 data alone @xcite .",
    "future cmbr measurements , e.g via the planck satellite @xcite , are expected to tighten this bound up to @xmath47 ( see eg .",
    "@xcite for a review , and @xcite to relate a given primordial bispectrum to the one imprinted onto the cmbr ) .",
    "furthermore , an all sky survey of the the 21-cm background in the frequency range from @xmath48 mhz to @xmath49 mhz with multipoles up to @xmath50 could potentially limit this parameter down to @xmath51 @xcite ; but it should be noted that this proposal is highly optimistic . if such an observation is indeed possible , higher order correlation functions might also be within reach of observation .",
    "it is expected that more complicated models of the early universe , such as @xmath0-flation , lead to larger contributions than simple single field models .",
    "the physical reason for this expectation is the presence of isocurvature modes , which in turn cause evolution of fluctuations even after crossing of the hubble radius ( referred to as horizon crossing in the following ) , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will give a thorough examination of non - gaussianities in models of @xmath0-flation , only restricted by the slow roll approximation .      to estimate the magnitude of the three and four point functions we use the non linear @xmath4-formalism @xcite , which is an extension of the linear @xmath4-formalism first proposed by starobinsky in @xcite and extended by sasaki and stewart @xcite among others @xcite .",
    "in this approach one relates the perturbation of the volume expansion rate @xmath4 to the curvature perturbation @xmath3 , which is possible if the initial hypersurface is flat and the final one is a uniform density hypersurface @xcite .",
    "notice that this quantity is conserved on large scales in simple models , even beyond linear order @xcite .- formalism . ] given this relationship between the curvature perturbation and the volume expansion rate , one can evaluate the momentum independent pieces of non - linearity parameters , which are related to higher order correlation functions , in terms of the change in @xmath8 during the evolution of the universe , see e.g. @xcite",
    ".    following this approach , the power - spectrum @xmath52 and the bispectrum @xmath53 can be computed .",
    "the ratio or @xmath53 to @xmath54 is proportional to the non - linearity parameter @xmath1 , modulo a momentum dependent prefactor and factors of @xmath55 .",
    "this computation was performed in @xcite with the result    @xmath56    where we introduced the short hand notation @xmath57 and we refer the interested reader to @xcite for details .",
    "we shall focus on the second term in ( [ fnl ] ) since the first one is known and rather small .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath58 characterizes the shape of the momentum triangle and is largest for an equilateral triangle ) , while @xmath59 is the usual tensor : scalar ratio .",
    "the observational upper limit on this quantity depends on the priors used in the fitting process , but we can reliably estimate that @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "this bound will be improved by future experiments , for example clover @xcite , among others . ]",
    "if we further use the summation convention for capital indices , we arrive at was already computed in @xcite within the horizon crossing approximation , but we repeat it here for completeness . ]",
    "@xmath61    to estimate the magnitude of the four point function , we use the momentum independent parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 as introduced in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , @xmath64    as mentioned above , we use the horizon crossing approximation in this section in order to compute the derivatives of the volume expansion rate ; that is , we assume that modes do not evolve once they cross the hubble radius at @xmath6 . with this in mind",
    ", we can set @xmath65 .",
    "instead  the different choices lead to the same results if modes are indeed frozen after horizon crossing . ] since we also use the slow roll approximation , we can write ( [ nofh ] ) as @xmath66 confining ourselves to @xmath0-flation , that is , if we make use of @xmath67 , and employing equal energy initial conditions , @xmath68 , we arrive at @xmath69 where all potentials and slow roll parameters have to be evaluated at @xmath6 , and we replaced first derivatives with respect to @xmath70 by @xmath71 .    it is now straightforward to evaluate the non - gaussianity parameters to @xmath72 these parameters are leading order in the slow roll approximation , independent of the mass spectrum of @xmath0-flation and indeed indistinguishable from a single - field model with quadratic potential @xcite .",
    "this is expected , since we neglected the main feature distinguishing multi - field models from single - field ones : the evolution of perturbations after horizon crossing due to the presence of isocurvature modes .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath63 is due to the use of quadratic potentials so third derivatives of the potentials vanish .",
    "we saw in the previous section that @xmath0-flation is indistinguishable from single - field models with respect to non - gaussianities if the horizon crossing approximation is used .",
    "consequently , we must incorporate the discriminating feature  the evolution of modes after hc . to simplify matters ,",
    "we make further use of the slow roll approximation , and restrict ourselves to computing @xmath73 , which is the most observationally constrained parameter .",

    "we distinguish two cases : the first one involves narrow mass spectra that have @xmath88 . this will result in a simple , analytic expression ; the second one deals with more realistic broad mass spectra , e.g. for @xmath19 . to simplify our notation",

    "we mean @xmath90 obviously , this case corresponds to the limit @xmath91 , which is not theoretically favored , but is , nevertheless , the easiest one to consider . using the marenko - pastur distribution",
    ", we arrive at the relation @xmath92 between @xmath93 and @xmath94 , where we made use of appendix [ app1 ] in the last step .",
    "using ( [ cond1])-([deltaofz ] ) one can evaluate the field values @xmath70 and @xmath95 and the corresponding slow roll parameters , which can be found in @xcite .",
    "there , it was also shown that the second term in ( [ f_nl ] ) becomes @xmath96 that is , it is second order in the slow roll parameters , as well as second order in @xmath93 .",
    "using the same method , the first term in ( [ f_nl ] ) becomes @xmath97 which includes , naturally , the contribution proportional to @xmath98 , already present in the horizon crossing approximation .",
    "hence we arrive at @xmath99 where we only kept the leading order contribution in @xmath93 .",
    "if we now use @xmath93 from ( [ deltaofz ] ) and @xmath100 we get after expanding in @xmath94 @xmath101    this is our first major result : if we compare the above with ( [ fnlhc ] ) , we observe an additional term proportional @xmath102 , which vanishes if all the masses coincide .",
    "this is expected since , in the equal mass case , there is no evolution of modes after they cross the horizon .",
    "however , isocurvature modes get sourced for a non - zero width of the mass distribution .",
    "this in turn causes modes to evolve even after their wavelength becomes larger than the hubble radius , leaving an imprint onto @xmath73 .",
    "note that the correction term in ( [ fnlnhc ] ) carries an additional slow roll suppression . as a consequence , even if experiments improve so far as to probe non - gaussianities created in single - field inflationary models ( which are of order @xmath98 ) we will not be able to distinguish them from @xmath0-flation by means of their primordial non - gaussianity , as long as non - gaussianities are generated during slow roll and the mass spectrum is narrow . for simplicity , we restricted ourselves to small @xmath16 , so that expanding in terms of this small parameter is possible ; hence , the resulting correction is even more suppressed by @xmath102 .",
    "now , considering that the preferred mass spectrum in @xmath0-flation corresponds to @xmath19 , which is indeed broad , we must compute the _ _ exact _ _ limit , since we are going to use the marenko - pastur mass distribution in order to evaluate expectation values .",

    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the contribution due to ( [ finalf ] ) will also be negligible for broad mass spectra , in agreement with the conclusions of @xcite .      in @xmath0-flation",
    "the mass spectrum is known to conform to the marenko - pastur distribution ( [ mpdistr ] ) .",
    "armed with the expectations values introduced in ( [ defexp0 ] ) , along with ( [ defexp ] ) we can evaluate all sums in ( [ f_nl ] ) .",
    "however , before we can perform this replacement , we need to proceed in a similar manner as we saw in the previous section , where we evaluated the narrow mass spectrum . strictly speaking",
    ", we have to calculate the field values at @xmath7 and @xmath6 from ( [ cond4])-([cond1 ] ) in order to compute the potentials and slow roll parameters that appear in ( [ f_nl])-([defa ] ) .    before we continue",
    ", we should mention another subtlety in our analysis : we take @xmath7 to be the time when the field with the largest mass leaves slow roll ( [ cond1 ] ) ; this time does not correspond to the end of inflation if the mass spectrum is stretched out considerably ; since there is no cross coupling between the fields , the remaining fields can successfully continue to drive inflation even if a heavy field leaves slow roll . consequently",

    "hence we may use @xmath136+\\bar{c}^2\\xi^2\\left[-\\mathcal{f}_{0}^{2}+3\\mathcal{f}_{0}^{3}\\right]-\\bar{c}^3\\xi^3\\mathcal{f}_{1}^{3}}{\\left(\\mathcal{f}_{-2}^{0}-2\\mathcal{f}_{-2}^{1}+\\mathcal{f}_{-2}^{2}-2\\bar{c}\\xi\\left[\\mathcal{f}_{-1}^{2}-\\mathcal{f}_{-1}^{1}\\right]+\\bar{c}^2\\xi^2\\mathcal{f}_{0}^{2}\\right)^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as an approximation in the region that is preferred in @xmath0-flation .    around the preferred value of @xmath137 the magnitude of @xmath138 is smaller than the horizon crossing result , but only by a few percent ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "such a deviation will never be observable .",
    "the minimum is reached for @xmath139 and @xmath138 increases for larger values of @xmath16 so that it catches up with the horizon crossing result around @xmath140 . for even larger values of @xmath16",
    "the magnitude of the non - linearity parameter increases more and more , seemingly becoming significantly large .",
    "however , one should take this result with caution , specifically the limit @xmath45 .",
    "corresponds to an infinitely broad mass spectrum , so @xmath141 always . ] here , we took the final time @xmath81 to be the time at which the heaviest field leaves slow roll .",
    "in addition , we assumed that sixty e - folds of inflation occurred between @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "however , if the spectrum of masses is indeed very broad , there will be a considerable amount of inflation even after the heaviest fields leave / left slow roll ; hence , the potentially large value for @xmath138 at @xmath81 might very well be a transient phenomenon , due to a few heavy fields .",
    "note that according to the marenko - pastur distribution the majority of fields will have relatively light masses in the broad spectrum case , see figure [ fig1 ] and that the majority of the masses are smaller than the average one for @xmath16 close to one . as a result",
    ", one might actually neglect the few heavy fields altogether , meaning , one might want to truncate the mass spectrum , since heavy fields will roll towards their minimum a lot faster than light ones .    of course , if a field leaves slow roll and starts to evolve faster , our formalism is not applicable any more up until the field settled in its minimum .",
    "we propose a method to estimate the production of non - gaussianities analytically during these intervals in the next section ( see also @xcite for recent numerical work ) .    before we continue",
    ", we would like to remind the reader of the limitations of our approach : first , we focused on potentials without any cross coupling between the fields .",
    "one can argue in favor of vanishing couplings in the case of @xmath0-flation if the fields stay close to the minima of their potential @xcite , but in general such an assumption is rather artificial .",
    "if such couplings are present , one should expect an enhanced production of non - gaussianities .",
    "we also considered only quadratic potentials with mass spectra that conform to the marenko - pastur distribution .",
    "we focused on this class , since the mp - distribution is expected to properly describe the spread of masses in @xmath0-flation in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "we do not expect qualitative differences for other spectra .",
    "nevertheless , if the potentials are not quadratic but quartic or exponential , we expect an additional suppression : since an attractor solution is present for potentials of these types ( see e.g. @xcite ) , isocurvature perturbations will be suppressed and in turn any evolution of modes after horizon crossing will also be suppressed , resulting in an additional reduction of non - gaussianities .",
    "lastly , we considered equal energy initial conditions , mainly to simplify the computations .",
    "since there is no attractor solution for quadratic potentials , there is a dependence on the chosen initial state .",
    "this unavoidable sensitivity to the initial configuration of fields may be considered a flaw of @xmath0-flation , since the model becomes less predictive . however , the evident slow roll suppression of non - gaussianities is insensitive to the chosen initial state , see e.g. the two - field cases studied in @xcite .",
    "we saw in the previous sections that multi - field inflationary models like @xmath0-flation do not generate large non - gaussianities during slow roll .",
    "henceforth , one can hardly discern them from simple single - field models .",
    "we expect our conclusions to be quite general , applicable to any kind of multi - field model during slow roll , given that the potential is separable and the kinetic terms of the scalar fields are canonical",
    ". however , if fields are evolving faster , one might still produce measurable contributions to the non - linearity parameter @xmath1 or higher order parameters such as @xmath63 or @xmath62 .",
    "consider for instance the case where a few fields start to evolve faster while inflation still continues .",
    "whenever a field behaves that way , the trajectory in field space will make a sharp turn and consequently , isocurvature perturbations will cause the adiabatic mode to evolve so that non - gaussianities are generated .",
    "this additional source of non - gaussianity could be recaptured by an effective one - field model : first , replace the multiple inflaton fields by one effective degree of freedom @xmath17 , which evolves due to an effective potential @xmath142 @xcite .",
    "doing so corresponds to the horizon crossing approximation at the perturbed level .",
    "anyhow , this should be a good approximation since we know already that the additional contributions due to the evolution of modes after horizon crossing will hardly ever be observable .",
    "further , assume that one of the fields leaves slow roll and starts to evolve faster . to incorporate the effect of the kink in the multi - field trajectory , introduce a step in the effective potential , followed by a subsequent re - definition of the effective model where the field under consideration is omitted .",
    "comparing the effective model before and after removal of the field will provide the step width @xmath143 and height @xmath144 .",
    "hence , we arrive at a toy model with a single inflaton field , but sharp steps in the inflaton potential .",
    "such steps can cause considerable non - gaussianities @xcite , in addition to a _ ringing _ in the power spectrum , which might actually be easier to observe than @xmath1 itself @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the fields that left slow roll will settle in a minimum of their potential without influencing the dynamics of the universe any more .",
    "nevertheless , we do not expect this case to be realized in @xmath0-flation : consider a broad mass spectrum ( e.g. for @xmath145 ) as a concrete model ; here , the heavy fields violate indeed the slow roll condition @xmath146 while inflation still goes on , but they experience an extra damping , not acceleration , since @xmath147 . since they evolve slower than expected from the slow roll approximation , they should not cause any additional non - gaussianities , but simply hang around up until the light fields start to evolve faster .",
    "this will occur shortly before the onset of ( p)re - heating , corresponding to the breakdown of slow roll for @xmath17 in the effective single - field description .",
    "consequently , we expect ( p)re - heating , to be the primary additional source of non - gaussianity ( see e.g. @xcite ) in @xmath0-flation .",
    "( p)re - heating should occur in a slightly stretched - out manner during that last one or two e - folds , since fields do not contribute all at once .",
    "since the universe is evolving throughout , we expect expansion effects to be relevant",
    ". henceforth , simple parametric resonance models ignoring the aforementioned expansion will not be suitable .",
    "however , stochastic resonance @xcite , that is , broad parametric resonance in an expanding universe , seems to be a possibility .",
    "a careful examination of the above mentioned topics , especially ( p)re - heating , is in preparation @xcite .",
    "in this article we considered @xmath0-flation as a concrete realization of assisted inflation motivated by string theory .",
    "interested in distinguishing this multi - field model from simple single - field ones , we computed primordial non - gaussianities .    after reviewing dynamics of @xmath0-flation during slow roll , we evaluated non - linearity parameters characterizing the bi- and trispectrum in the horizon crossing approximation . in this limit @xmath0-flation , and other multi - field models ,",
    "become indistinguishable from their single - field analogs .    as a consequence , we incorporated the evolution of perturbations after horizon crossing .",
    "this evolution is due to the presence of isocurvature perturbations and provides a means of discriminating multi - field models from single - field ones .",
    "focusing on the non - linearity parameter @xmath1 , which will be heavily constraint by observations in the near future , we evaluated its magnitude for narrow and broad mass distributions . in @xmath0-flation",
    ", this mass spectrum is described by the marenko - pastur law .",
    "we identified additional contributions , which turned out to be only a few percent of the horizon crossing result so that they are unobservable .",
    "the smallness of the additional terms is due to the slow roll approximation employed in this paper .",
    "henceforth , we turn our attention to dynamics beyond slow roll ; we argue that large , but possibly transient , contributions to @xmath1 should be expected from fast rolling fields .",
    "such fields are not expected in case of @xmath0-flation , but might be present in other multi field inflationary models .",
    "we suggest an effective single - field model with steps in its potential to retain the main physical effect of these fields .",
