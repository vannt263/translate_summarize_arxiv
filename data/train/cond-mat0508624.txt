    "the study of turbulence has very long history , going back at least to leonard da vinci , and the turbulent state in fluid dynamics is now intensely studied in various fields including mathematics , and the experimental , theoretical , and computational branches of physics @xcite . until recently , only classical turbulence ( ct ) has been studied .",
    "classical incompressible newtonian fluids are usually described using the navier - stokes equation    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the velocity of fluid , @xmath2 is the external pressure , @xmath3 is the density of fluid and @xmath4 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "time development of @xmath1 is dominated by eq .",
    "( [ eq - navier - stokes ] ) , while eq .",
    "( [ eq - continuity ] ) confirms incompressibility of fluid and determines @xmath2 .",
    "flow of this fluid can be characterized by the ratio of the second term of the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq - navier - stokes ] ) , hereafter the inertial term , to the second term of the right - hand side , hereafter the viscous term .",
    "this ratio is the reynolds number @xmath5 here @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the characteristic velocity of flow and the characteristic scale , respectively .",
    "when @xmath6 increases to the point that the reynolds number exceeds a critical value , the system changes from a laminar to a turbulent state in which the flow is highly complicated with many eddies .",
    "these eddies have a high concentration of vorticity @xmath8 . owing to its complexity ,",
    "the dynamics of the turbulent state is very difficult to investigate .",
    "nevertheless , g. i. taylor , a pioneer of modern studies of turbulence , built a theoretical and experimental framework for turbulence by introducing the idea in which turbulence is _ homogeneous _ and _ isotropic _ at smaller scales than the system size @xmath7 @xcite . based on this idea , kolmogorov proposed a self - similar , equilibrium state of fully developed turbulence together with a statistical law of turbulence called the kolmogorov law @xcite .",
    "the kolmogorov law was confirmed through many experimental and theoretical studies , which led to an explosion in our understanding of ct .",
    "today , numerical simulation of the navier - stokes equation is an indispensable tool for understanding ct because it is almost impossible to study the equation analytically .",
    "the rapid development of computers with the resulting improvements of large - scale simulations has accelerated our understanding of ct .",
    "however , two major problems have remained .",
    "one is that a large system size @xmath7 and a sufficient spatial resolution are required for analyzing well - developed ct at high reynolds numbers @xmath9 ; a problem that needs higher - powered computers for its solution .",
    "the other problem is the identification of eddies in ct : there is no global way to identify classical eddies .",
    "there are several variables to identify eddies , such as the pressure , the velocity field , and the vorticity @xcite , but the identification of eddies in ct depends on the choice of these variables and their thresholds of identification . as a result ,",
    "the dynamics of eddies , for example , the cascade process of eddies in ct , becomes only conceptual .",
    "consequently , the existence of the cascade process , the self - similarity of the dynamics of eddies , and how they are related to the statistics of ct are not well understood .",
    "recently , in the field of low temperature physics , a similarity has been found between ct and turbulence in superfluid 4 . as a result",
    ", there has been much interest in studying superfluid turbulence ( st ) as a way to better understand ct .",
    "the physics of st in liquid 4 is one of the most important topics in low temperature physics @xcite .",
    "liquid 4 enters the superfluid state at 2.17 k. below this temperature , the hydrodynamics is usually described using the two - fluid model in which the system consists of an inviscid superfluid and a viscous normal fluid .",
    "early experimental studies on the subject focused on thermal counterflow in which the normal fluid and superfluid flow in opposite directions . their flow is driven by the injected heat current , and it was found that the superflow becomes dissipative when the relative velocity between two fluids exceeds a critical value @xcite .",
    "feynman proposed that this is a superfluid turbulent state consisting of a tangle of quantized vortices @xcite .",
    "vinen later confirmed feynman s proposition experimentally by showing that the dissipation comes from the mutual friction between vortices and the normal flow @xcite .",
    "after that , many experimental studies were done on st in thermal counterflow systems @xcite . in particular",
    ", schwarz clarified the picture of st having tangled vortices by doing a large - scale numerical simulation of the quantized vortex - filament model in thermal counterflow @xcite .",
    "however , as thermal counterflow has no analogy with conventional fluid dynamics , it has not helped us understood the relation between st and ct .",
    "more recently , experiments have been done on st that do not involve thermal counterflow .",
    "such studies opened a new stage in studies of st .",
    "_ studied a st that was driven by two counter - rotating disks @xcite in superfluid 4 at temperatures above 1.4 k. they measured the pressure and converted it to the local velocity fluctuation , and found that the energy spectrum was consistent with the kolmogorov law .",
    "measured the attenuation of second sound @xcite in superfluid 4 at temperatures above 1 k , and found that inferred decay of grid turbulence was consistent with the kolmogorov law .",
    "these experiments are consistent in the sense that they show similarities between st and ct .",
    "this similarity can be understood using the idea that the superfluid and the normal fluid are likely to be coupled together by the mutual friction between them and thus to behave like a conventional fluid @xcite .",
    "however , the normal fluid is negligible at very low temperatures , and this brings up an important question : even without the normal fluid , is st still similar to ct ? such a fluid is a pure quantum fluid and its turbulence can be called _ quantum turbulence _ , hereafter qt .    to address this question , we consider the statistical law of ct @xcite . for fully developed turbulence of an incompressible classical fluid , the energy is injected into the fluid at scales comparable to the system size @xmath7 in the energy - containing range , and in the inertial range , this energy is transferred to smaller scales without being dissipated . in this range ,",
    "the system is locally homogeneous and isotropic , which leads to the statistics of the energy spectrum known as the kolmogorov law @xmath10 here the energy spectrum @xmath11 is defined as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the kinetic energy per unit mass and @xmath14 is the wave number from the fourier transformation of the velocity field .",
    "the energy transferred to smaller scales in the energy - dissipative range is dissipated through the viscosity of the fluid with the dissipation rate @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ eq - kolmogorov ] ) , which is equal to the energy flux @xmath16 in the inertial range .",
    "the kolmogorov constant @xmath17 is a dimensionless parameter of order unity @xcite .",
    "the inertial range is thought to be sustained by the self - similar richardson cascade in which large eddies are broken up into smaller ones with many reconnections . in ct , however , the richardson cascade is not completely understood because it is impossible to definitely identify each eddy - the eddies keep nucleating and annihilating due to the viscosity .",
    "in contrast , quantized vortices in a quantum fluid are definite and stable topological defects . at low temperatures , a macroscopic number of particles in a bose system , such as liquid 4 ,",
    "occupy a single particle ground state . in this case ,",
    "matter waves of bose particles form a coherent scalar macroscopic wave function @xmath18 $ ] , which is known as bose - einstein condensation .",
    "the dynamics of the macroscopic wave function is governed by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite @xmath19\\phi(\\vec{x},t).\\label{eq - gp}\\ ] ] the gp equation is obtained from the hamilton - jacobi equation for the hamiltonian @xmath20,\\label{eq - hamiltonian}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the chemical potential , @xmath22 is the coupling constant , @xmath23 is the condensate density , and the superfluid velocity @xmath1 is given by @xmath24 .",
    "the vorticity @xmath8 vanishes everywhere in a single - connected region of the fluid and thus , all rotational flow is carried by quantized vortices . in the core of each vortex , @xmath25 vanishes so that the circulation @xmath26 around the core is quantized by @xmath27 .",
    "the vortex core size is given by the healing length @xmath28 .",
    "quantized vortices at finite temperatures can decay through mutual friction with the normal fluid at any scale . at very low temperatures",
    "the vortices can decay by 1 ) the emission of compressible excitation through vortex reconnections @xcite , and 2 ) a process in which vortices reduce through the richardson cascade process and eventually change to compressible excitations .",
    "these are the only two decay mechanisms at very low temperature . in any case",
    ", dissipation occurs only at scales below the healing length ; for larger scales , we can obtain the turbulent state at high reynolds numbers that is free from dissipation by quantized vortices .",
    "therefore , qt at very low temperatures gives the high reynolds number and the real richardson cascade of definite quantized vortices , and thus can become an ideal prototype to study statistics such as the kolmogorov law and the richardson cascade in the inertial range of ct .",
    "there are two formulations for studying the dynamics of quantized vortices in qt .",
    "one is the vortex - filament model @xcite , and the other is the gp model . by using the vortex - filament model with no normal fluid component , araki _ et al .",
    "_ studied numerically a vortex tangle arising from taylor - green flow , and obtained an energy spectrum consistent with the kolmogorov law @xcite . by eliminating the smallest vortices , which had a size comparable to the numerical space resolution , they introduced dissipation into the system and realized decaying turbulence .",
    "_ used the gp equation to numerically study the energy spectrum of qt @xcite .",
    "they showed that the kinetic energy consists of a compressible part due to compressible excitations and an incompressible part coming from quantized vortices .",
    "compressible excitations of wavelength smaller than the healing length are created through vortex reconnections or through the disappearance of small vortex loops @xcite , so that the incompressible kinetic energy changes to compressible kinetic energy while conserving the total energy .",
    "the spectrum of the incompressible kinetic energy is consistent with the kolmogorov law in a short period @xcite .",
    "however , the consistency is broken in the late stage when many compressible excitations are created @xcite and hinder the richardson cascade process , even on the large scales .",
    "our approach here is to introduce a dissipation term that works only on scales smaller than the healing length @xmath29 .",
    "this dissipation term can account for dissipation processes such as the scattering between the particle reservoir and the emitted compressible excitations that can occur only at scales smaller than @xmath29 even at @xmath30 k @xcite .",
    "this dissipation removes only short - wavelength excitations ( not vortices ) , thus preventing the vortices from receiving the excitation energy .",
    "compared to the usual gp model , this approach enables us to more clearly study the relation between qt and ct",
    ". the richardson cascade process at the large scales must be independent of the details of the dissipative mechanism at the small scales .",
    "we use our modified gp equation to investigate two types of qt . for decaying turbulence , we start from random configurations of the phase of the wave function and study the decay .",
    "we provide here a more detailed study of this type than that discussed in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "for steady turbulence ( the other type ) , we assume that energy is injected into the system at a large scale by a moving random potential . for both types , compressible excitations are highly suppressed compared to quantized vortices , and the spectrum of the incompressible kinetic energy is found to be consistent with the kolmogorov law , which verifies that qt is similar to ct .",
    "we also show here that steady turbulence with the moving random potential clarifies the energy - containing range , the inertial range and the energy - dissipative range . by calculating the energy dissipation rate and the energy flux in the wave number space , we confirmed the following scenario .",
    "first , vortices are nucleated by the moving random potential in the energy - containing range .",
    "second , the vortices decay into smaller vortices in the inertial range through the richardson cascade process . finally , the smallest vortices change to compressible excitations , which are then removed by the introduced dissipation",
    "although this scenario of quantized vortices in qt is very similar to that believed about eddies in ct , it is much clearer , because quantized vortices are definite topological defects .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec - model ] , we review our model of the modified gp equation that includes small - scale dissipation . after discussing the numerical procedure of our model in sec .",

    "section [ sec - conclusion ] is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we discuss the dynamics of the original gp equation ( [ eq - gp ] ) with quantized vortices and why the compressible short - wavelength excitations make it difficult to study qt . then we propose a modified gp equation with small - scale dissipation .",
    "the modified gp equation gives a clear criterion for the inertial range of qt and has a form similar to that of the navier - stokes equation with large effective reynolds number .",

    "except for the dynamics of vortices described in eq .",

    ", the vortices tend to be bent , which allows smaller structure to form , thus sustaining the richardson cascade process .",

    "<S> classical turbulence arises from complicated dynamics of eddies in a classical fluid . in contrast , quantum turbulence consists of a tangle of stable topological defects called quantized vortices , and thus quantum turbulence provides a simpler prototype of turbulence than classical turbulence . in this paper , we investigate the dynamics and statistics of quantized vortices in quantum turbulence by numerically solving a modified gross - pitaevskii equation . </S>",
    "<S> first , to make decaying turbulence , we introduce a dissipation term that works only at scales below the healing length . </S>",
    "<S> second , to obtain steady turbulence through the balance between injection and decay , we add energy injection at large scales . </S>",
    "<S> the energy spectrum is quantitatively consistent with the kolmogorov law in both decaying and steady turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , this is the first study that confirms the inertial range of quantum turbulence . </S>"
