    "a great deal of contributions have been devoted to the entanglement criteria of gaussian states @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite which are continuous variable states that can be determined only by their first and second moments . recently , non - gaussian states attract much attentions for its good performance in quantum teleportation @xcite , dense coding @xcite , quantum computation @xcite and nonlocality test @xcite .",

    "we have introduced the ideas of coherent subtraction and coherent addition to describe many kinds of bipartite non - gaussian states and investigate their inseparability .",
    "the non - gaussian states produced from their gaussian kernels are quite generic .",

    "the necessary and sufficient separable condition is obtained and it is exactly the same as that of its kernel state .",
    "a symmetric coherent subtraction state produced from the symmetric first standard form gaussian state ( except two - mode squeezed thermal state ) is entangled when the gaussian kernel is at the boundary of separability and all the superposition coefficients have positive real and/or imaginary parts .",
    "thus a proper arranged coherent subtraction produces entanglement from a separable state . for photon number entangled state evolving in thermal noise and amplitude damping channel , we give the analytical entanglement condition . as applications , we present the separable conditions of two mode coherently correlated states with poisson coefficients and photonic bell states evolving in thermal noise and amplitude damping environment .",
    "any two term coherent addition state produced form boundary separable symmetric two - mode squeezed thermal state is entangled if the two complex coefficients give rise to constructive interference .",
