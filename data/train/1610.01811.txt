    "<S> we report @xmath0te nuclear magnetic resonance and @xmath1ta nuclear quadrupole resonance studies on single - crystal ta@xmath2pd@xmath3te@xmath4 , which has a quasi - one - dimensional structure and superconducts below @xmath5 k. @xmath1ta with spin @xmath6 is sensitive to quadrupole interactions , while @xmath0te with spin @xmath7 can only relax by magnetic interactions . by comparing the spin - lattice relaxation rate ( @xmath8 ) of @xmath1ta and @xmath0te </S>",
    "<S> , we found that electric - field - gradient ( efg ) fluctuations develop below @xmath9 k. the efg fluctuations are enhanced with decreasing temperature due to the fluctuations of a charge density wave that sets in at @xmath10 k , below which the spectra are broadened and @xmath11 drops sharply . in the superconducting state , @xmath8 shows a hebel - slichter coherence peak just below @xmath12 for @xmath0te , indicating that ta@xmath2pd@xmath3te@xmath4 is a full - gap superconductor without nodes in the gap function . </S>",
    "<S> the coherence peak is absent in the @xmath8 of @xmath1ta due to the strong efg fluctuations . </S>"
