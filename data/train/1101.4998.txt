    "gauge boson self - interactions are consequences of the @xmath2 gauge structure of the standard model ( sm ) . measurements of these couplings are crucial to test the non - abelian structure of the electroweak sector . experimental results obtained from experiments at cern lep and fermilab tevatron confirm the sm predictions .",
    "probing these couplings with a higher sensitivity can either lead to additional confirmation of the sm or give some hint for new physics beyond the sm .    in this work",
    "we have analyzed the anomalous @xmath1 couplings via single w boson production in @xmath3 collision at the lhc .",
    "a quasi - real photon emitted from one proton beam can interact with the other proton and produce w boson through deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) . since the emitted quasi - real photons have a low virtuality they do not spoil the proton structure .",
    "therefore the processes like @xmath4 can be studied at the lhc ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "photon induced reactions in a hadron - hadron collision were observed in the measurements of cdf collaboration @xcite .",
    "for instance the reactions ; @xmath5 @xcite , @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite were verified experimentally .",
    "these results raise interest on the potential of lhc as a photon - photon and photon - proton collider .",
    "atlas and cms collaborations have a program of forward physics with extra detectors located at distances of 220 m and 420 m from the interaction point @xcite .",
    "the physics program of this new instrumentation covers soft and hard diffraction , high energy photon - induced interactions , low - x dynamics with forward jet studies , large rapidity gaps between forward jets , and luminosity monitoring @xcite .",
    "one of the main features of these forward detectors is to tag the protons with some momentum fraction loss , @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 is the momentum of incoming proton and @xmath10 is the momentum of intact scattered proton .",
    "complementary to proton - proton interactions , forward detector equipment at the lhc allows to study photon - photon and photon - proton interactions at energies higher than at any existing collider .",
    "new physics searches in photon - induced interactions at the lhc have being discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of @xmath1 couplings has been done in @xcite via the process @xmath11 .",
    "this process receives contributions both from anomalous @xmath1 and @xmath12 couplings . on the other hand the process @xmath0 isolates @xmath1 coupling and gives us the opportunity to study @xmath1 vertex independent from @xmath12 .",
    "therefore any signal which conflicts with the sm predictions would be a convincing evidence for new physics effects in @xmath1 .",
    "we consider the following subprocesses of the reaction @xmath13 @xmath14 we neglect interactions between different family quarks since the cross sections are suppressed due to small off diagonal elements of the ckm matrix .",
    "quasi - real photon which enters the subprocess is described by equivalent photon approximation ( epa ) @xcite .",
    "equivalent photon spectrum of virtuality @xmath15 and energy @xmath16 is given by @xmath17\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 here e is the energy of the incoming proton beam and @xmath19 is the mass of the proton .",
    "the magnetic moment of the proton is taken to be @xmath20 . @xmath21 and @xmath22 are functions of the electric and magnetic form factors .",
    "the above epa formula differs from the pointlike electron positron case by taking care of the electromagnetic form factors of the proton .",
    "the cross section for the complete process @xmath23 can be obtained by integrating the cross section for the subprocess @xmath24 over the photon and quark spectra @xmath25 here , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the momentum fraction of the proton s momentum carried by the quark .",
    "second integral in ( 5 ) is obtained by transforming the differentials @xmath28 into @xmath29 with a jacobian determinant @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 is the total mass of the final particles of the subprocess @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 is the quark distribution function of the proton and @xmath35 is @xmath34 evaluated at @xmath36 . at high energies greater than proton mass",
    "it is a good approximation to write @xmath37 .",
    "the virtuality of the quark is taken to be @xmath38 during calculations .",
    "one should note that @xmath15 and @xmath39 refer to different particles . in our calculations parton distribution functions of martin , stirling , thorne and watt @xcite have been used .",
    "new physics contributions to @xmath1 couplings can be investigated in a model independent way by means of the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "the theoretical basis of such an approach rely on the assumption that at higher energies beyond where the sm is tested , there is a more fundamental theory which reduces to the sm at lower energies . the sm is assumed to be an effective low - energy theory in which heavy fields have been integrated out .",
    "such a procedure is quite general and independent of the new interactions at the new physics energy scale .",
    "the charge and parity conserving effective lagrangian for @xmath1 interaction can be written following the papers @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 and dimensionless parameters @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are related to the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments .",
    "the tree - level sm values for these parameters are @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . for on - shell photons , @xmath45 is fixed by electromagnetic gauge invariance to its sm value at tree - level .",

    "cms - totem forward detector scenario spans @xmath52 and @xmath54 @xcite .    in fig.[fig2 ] and fig.[fig3 ] we plot the integrated total cross section of the process @xmath4 as a function of anomalous couplings @xmath55 and @xmath44 for the acceptances @xmath51 and @xmath56 .",
    "we sum all the contributions from subprocesses given in equation ( [ subprocesses ] ) .",
    "we do not plot the cross section for the acceptance @xmath52 since there is only a minor difference between the curves for @xmath52 and @xmath57 . in these figures",
    "we observe that although @xmath56 case gives small cross sections , deviations of the cross sections from their sm values are large .",
    "this feature especially remarkable for the cross section as a function of the coupling @xmath44 .",
    "a detailed investigation of the anomalous couplings requires a statistical analysis . to this purpose",

    "atlas and cms have central detectors with a pseudorapidity coverage @xmath64 .",
    "therefore we place a cut of @xmath64 for electrons and muons from decaying w and also for final quarks from subprocess @xmath65 .    in table",

    "sensitivity bounds on the anomalous coupling parameters @xmath66 and @xmath44 for various integrated luminosities and forward detector acceptances of @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 . during statistical analysis",

    "we see from the tables that bounds on @xmath66 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 cases are almost same .",
    "they are more than an order of magnitude better than the bound obtained from @xmath69 case . on the other hand , bounds on @xmath44",

    "[ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] , we consider a center of mass energy of @xmath70tev for the proton - proton system .",
    "but the lhc will not operate at @xmath70 tev before the year 2013 .",
    "therefore it is valuable to search its sensitivity at @xmath71 tev . to this purpose",
    "we present table [ tab3 ] where the sensitivity bounds are obtained at @xmath71 tev with an integrated luminosity of 1 - 2@xmath72 .",
    "the current bounds on anomalous @xmath1 couplings are provided by fermilab tevatron and cern lep .",
    "the most stringent bounds obtained at the tevatron are @xcite @xmath73 at 95% c.l .. the combined fits of the four lep experiments improves the precision to @xcite @xmath74 at 95% c.l .. although the lep bounds are more precise than the bounds from the tevatron , lep results are obtained via the reactions @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 where first two reactions receive contributions both from @xmath1 and @xmath78 couplings . therefore in general , limits given in ( [ lep ] ) can not be regarded as a bound on pure @xmath1 couplings .",
    "lhc with a forward detector equipment gives us the opportunity to study photon - photon and photon - proton interactions at energies higher than at any existing collider .",
    "the reaction @xmath79 provides a rather clean channel compared to pure dis reactions due to absence of one of the incoming proton remnants .",
    "furthermore detection of the intact scattered protons in the forward detectors allows us to reconstruct quasi - real photons momenta .",
    "this may be useful in reconstructing the kinematics of the reaction .",
