    "only the mass matrix , which is well - conditioned after suitable diagonal scaling , needs to be inverted . in particular ,",
    "no sort of advanced multi - level preconditioning is necessary .",

    "another reason is that the symmetry of central differences leads to conservation of the inherent energy of the problem . among the most simple and successful schemes of this type",

    "essentially , the cfl condition forbids any type of spatial adaptivity .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that this phenomenon is a consequence of the high flexibility of adaptive finite elements .",
    "the restriction of the time step by the minimal spatial mesh size can easily be removed by projecting the adaptive finite element space to some subspace @xmath9 with similar ( optimal ) approximation properties for weak solutions of the wave equation under the moderate regularity assumption @xmath10 for almost all @xmath11 .",
    "the underlying technique is well - established in the context of numerical homogenisation  @xcite , also for a semi - discrete wave equation  @xcite .",
    "the reduced space @xmath9 allows for an improved inverse inequality that decouples the time step from the minimal mesh size and turns the leapfrog into a feasible numerical scheme also on adaptive spatial meshes .",
    "another approach for avoiding ( global ) fine time step sizes consists in a combination of fine time step sizes in regions with small spatial elements and of larger time step sizes in regions with coarser spatial elements .",
    "this approach was introduced in @xcite and is motivated by small geometric features .",
    "it seems to work very well in the case of locally isolated refinement and essentially two separate spatial discretisation scales .",
    "however , adaptive triangulations arising from spatial singularities are typically graded towards the singularity and encounter an ever increasing number of spatial discretisation scales .",
    "although the generalisation of local time stepping to this case with an increasing number of different time step sizes is possible @xcite , its realisation is certainly challenging and its behaviour with regard to stability and computational complexity is still open in such scenarios .",
    "our aim is to provide an alternative approach for the stabilisation of explicit time stepping that is based on reduction of spatial degrees of freedom rather than enriching the temporal discretisation .    other approaches to overcome a strong cfl condition is the locally implicit method analysed in  @xcite , which combines an explicit method with an implicit method in the region , where the mesh - size is small , and the singular complement method  @xcite , which adds singular functions to the standard ansatz space .",
