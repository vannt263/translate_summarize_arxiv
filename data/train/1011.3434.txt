    "the quantitative arithmetic of low degree del pezzo surfaces has received a great deal of attention in recent years .",
    "the aim of the present investigation is to provide a new tool in the analysis of such questions and to show how it can be used to estimate the number of @xmath4-rational points of bounded height on a del pezzo surface of degree @xmath3 defined over @xmath4 .",
    "such surfaces arise as subvarieties @xmath5 of weighted projective space and are given by equations of the shape @xmath6 where @xmath7 $ ] is a quartic form . in the classification of del pezzo surfaces",
    "it is those of degree @xmath8 and @xmath3 whose arithmetic remains the most elusive .",
    "if @xmath9 and @xmath10 denotes the anticanonical height function then it is natural to study the counting function @xmath11 as @xmath12 , for a zariski open subset @xmath13 obtained by deleting the accumulating subvarieties .",
    "these are the exceptional divisors arising from the bitangents of the plane quartic curve @xmath14 .",
    "there are @xmath15 of these when @xmath16 is non - singular , producing @xmath17 exceptional curves on @xmath18 . a well - known conjecture of manin @xcite predicts the existence of constants @xmath19 and @xmath20 such that @xmath21 as @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath23 denotes the minimal desingularisation of @xmath18 , with @xmath24 if it is non - singular , then it is expected that @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the picard group of @xmath23 .",
    "there is a prediction of peyre @xcite concerning the value of the constant @xmath27 .",
    "these refined conjectures have received a great deal of attention in the context of del pezzo surfaces of degree at least @xmath28 , an account of which can be found in browning s treatise @xcite .",
    "our success in degree @xmath3 has been rather limited however .",
    "when @xmath18 is non - singular it follows from work of broberg @xcite that @xmath29 for any @xmath30 .",
    "this argument uses siegel s lemma to cover the rational points of height at most @xmath31 on @xmath18 with @xmath32 plane sections @xmath33 defined over @xmath4 . for each of these one",
    "is left with counting points of bounded height on the curves @xmath34 given by @xmath35 with @xmath36 $ ] a binary form of degree @xmath37 .",
    "this one needs to do uniformly with respect to the coefficients of @xmath38 and is achieved via a modification of heath - brown s determinant method @xcite . for generic @xmath33",
    "the curve @xmath39 has genus @xmath8 and so one expects it to have very few rational points .",
    "nevertheless it is difficult to demonstrate this with the requisite degree of uniformity .    in this paper",
    "we will consider split singular @xmath18 , by which we mean that the quartic form @xmath16 is singular and the singularities and exceptional curves of @xmath18 are all defined over @xmath4 . according to the classification of alexeev and nikulin @xcite the minimal desingularisation @xmath23 can then be realised as the blow - up of @xmath40 along @xmath41 @xmath4-points in `` almost general position '' .",
    "as such one verifies that @xmath42 , so that @xmath43 in the manin conjecture",
    ". we will impose the condition that @xmath16 is reducible and we will assume that @xmath44 takes the shape @xmath45 this defines a del pezzo surface of degree @xmath3 with a unique exceptional curve @xmath46 and a unique singularity @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "according to the classification of arnold @xcite a hypersurface has a simple @xmath48 singularity if it can be put in the local normal form @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the dimension of the hypersurface . dividing through by @xmath51 and making a change of variables one",
    "is directly led to this normal form , so that @xmath18 has a simple @xmath48 singularity .",
    "it follows from work of ye ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 4.6 ) that there is only one such surface up to isomorphism .",
    "we let @xmath52 be the zariski open subset formed by deleting the curve @xmath46 from @xmath18 .",
    "when one returns to the above argument involving plane sections , the situation is more favourable since the resulting curves @xmath39 generically define elliptic curves with rational @xmath3-torsion . in this way",
    "one can show that @xmath53 for any @xmath30 . our goal is to show how the full manin conjecture can be established for this particular surface using analytic number theory .",
    "we will establish the following result .",
    "[ main ] we have @xmath54 as @xmath12 , where @xmath55 is the constant predicted by peyre .",
    "the investigations of derenthal and loughran @xcite show that @xmath18 is neither toric nor an equivariant compactification of @xmath56 .",
    "thus theorem [ main ] is not a special case of @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the proof of our theorem relies on a passage to the universal torsor above the minimal desingularisation @xmath23 of @xmath18 , which in this setting is a subset of the affine hypersurface @xmath57 , given by the equation @xmath58 the idea is to establish a bijection between @xmath59 and a suitable subset of @xmath60 .",
    "this step underpins many proofs of the manin conjecture , such as that found in work of la bretche , browning and derenthal @xcite dealing with the split cubic surface of singularity type @xmath61 . here , as there , it is useful to view the torsor equation as a congruence @xmath62 , with @xmath63 being thought of as the main variables .",
    "regrettably one finds that the arguments developed in @xcite no longer bear fruit in the present setting .",
    "rather one is forced to consider in general terms the counting function @xmath64 for @xmath65 , @xmath66 and non - zero integers @xmath0 such that @xmath67 . in our case of interest",
    "we have @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "one seeks an asymptotic formula for @xmath73 which is completely uniform in the relevant parameters .",
    "this will ultimately be achieved in  [ s : final ] , where it is recorded as theorem  [ t : final ] .",
    "a substantially easier problem is to produce a good upper bound for the counting function in which the condition @xmath74 is dropped .",
    "let us denote by @xmath75 this counting function .",
    "during the course of our argument we will be led to the following result in  [ s : proof - upper ] , which we record here for ease of use .",
    "[ cor:0 ] let @xmath30 , let @xmath76 and assume that @xmath77 .",
    "then we have @xmath78 where @xmath79    the implied constant in this estimate is allowed to depend on the choice of small parameter @xmath30 , a convention that we adhere to in all of our estimates .",
    "our estimate for @xmath75 is sharpest when @xmath80 has small square - free kernel or when @xmath81 is small compared with @xmath82 .",
    "it is the cornerstone of our entire investigation .",
    "it should be noted that when @xmath80 is square - free and @xmath83 theorem  [ cor:0 ] does not give anything sharper than what is available through the work of pierce @xcite .",
    "we proceed to give a simplified description of the method behind theorem [ cor:0 ] .",
    "the @xmath84 appearing in are constrained to lie in a certain region and our first task will be to cover this region by small boxes and to approximate their characteristic functions by smooth weights .",
    "this facilitates an application of the poisson summation formula , which we invoke after breaking the sums over @xmath85 and @xmath86 into residue classes modulo @xmath80 .",
    "this transformation leads to expressions involving exponential sums of the form @xmath87 for @xmath88 , where @xmath89 .",
    "if one were now to estimate these sums directly one would retrieve an estimate of the sort obtained by pierce @xcite . in the setting of theorem [ main",
    "] , however , this would only yield a final upper bound of the form @xmath90 . a key point in the method",
    "is to evaluate the sums @xmath91 explicitly for power - full moduli @xmath80 , a situation that explicitly arises in the application to theorem [ main ] since then @xmath72 contains high powers .",
    "this is carried out in  [ s : expsum ] , where an easy multiplicativity property renders it sufficient to study @xmath92 for primes @xmath93 and suitable @xmath94 .",
    "it turns out that considerable labour is required to deal with the primes @xmath95 and @xmath96 and the reader may be inclined to take the results of this section on faith at a first reading .    after explicitly evaluating the exponential sums @xmath91 at power - full moduli we encounter terms of the shape @xmath97 for @xmath88 such that @xmath98 and where @xmath99 is the multiplicative inverse of @xmath100 modulo @xmath80 .",
    "we need to sum these up non - trivially .",
    "our second key innovation is to flip the numerator and denominator , using the familiar identity @xmath101 for any non - zero integers @xmath102 such that @xmath103 .",
    "this has the desired effect of reducing the size of the denominator drastically .",
    "next , we break up the summation over @xmath104 into residue classes modulo the new denominator and use poisson summation in @xmath104 again . this time",
    "we encounter new cubic exponential sums and cubic exponential integrals which we need to estimate non - trivially .",
    "this leads to an asymptotic estimate for the number of solutions of the congruence @xmath105 in small boxes .",
    "the final step is to sum up all these contributions .",
    "in fact this summation is also carried out non - trivially , with parts of the averaging process replaced by an integration , in order to take advantage of extra cancellations . while this leads to substantial extra work it is nonetheless essential for obtaining the asymptotic formula in theorem [ main ] .    aside from its intrinsic utility in the proof of theorem  [ main ] we can use theorem  [ cor:0 ] and its refinement theorem [ t : final ] to tackle other questions in diophantine geometry .",
    "firstly , an inspection of the various universal torsors calculated by derenthal @xcite arising in the theory of split singular del pezzo surfaces , shows that the underlying counting function precisely matches whenever its singularity type is maximal .",
    "although we will not present details here , it is possible to provide independent proofs of the manin conjecture for such cases , albeit with weaker error terms than are already available .",
    "this includes the @xmath61 cubic surface considered by la bretche , browning and derenthal @xcite , the @xmath106 degree @xmath37 del pezzo surface considered by la bretche and browning @xcite and the @xmath107 degree @xmath108 del pezzo surface .",
    "the latter two surfaces are equivariant compactifications of @xmath56 by @xcite and so are covered by the investigation of chambert - loir and tschinkel @xcite .",
    "a second and rather different application of theorem [ cor:0 ] lies in the theory of elliptic curves over @xmath4 .",
    "such curves may be brought into weierstrass form @xmath109 for @xmath110 with non - zero discriminant @xmath111 , say .",
    "it is presently unknown whether there are infinitely many @xmath112 for which @xmath113 is prime .",
    "an easier questions concerns the square - freeness of @xmath113 .",
    "let @xmath114 be the exponential height of @xmath112 and let @xmath115 be the mbius function .",
    "we maintain the conventions @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "a measure of the density of elliptic curves with square - free discriminant is achieved by studying the quantity @xmath118 to establish the following result in  [ s : ec ] .",
    "[ t : ec ] for @xmath119 let @xmath120 .",
    "then for any @xmath30 we have @xmath121    for comparison wong ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 6 ) has shown a similar asymptotic formula but with only a logarithmic saving in the error term .",
    "in fact , as we shall see in ",
    "[ s : ec ] , an adaptation of an argument due to estermann @xcite would permit a power saving but only leads to an error term of order @xmath122 . through mbius inversion",
    "the problem is to count solutions to the congruence @xmath123 for square - free integers @xmath124 .",
    "estermann s approach helps us to deal with the contribution from both small and large @xmath124 .",
    "theorem  [ cor:0 ] is the key ingredient in the treatment of medium @xmath124 .",
    "some of this work was done while the authors were visiting the _ institute for advanced study _ in princeton , the hospitality and financial support of which is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "while working on this paper the authors were supported by epsrc grant number ` ep / e053262/1 ` .",
    "the authors are grateful to ulrich derenthal for drawing their attention to the @xmath48 del pezzo surface of degree @xmath3 and to both pierre le boudec and the referee for useful comments on an earlier version .",
    "in this section we show how theorem  [ t : ec ] follows from theorem [ cor:0 ] . using the mbius function to detect the square - freeness condition we may write @xmath125 where @xmath126 .",

    "this is a multiplicative function of @xmath80 and it is easy to see that @xmath133 for any prime @xmath93 .",
    "hence we have @xmath134 for any square - free @xmath135 .",

    "once armed with this it is then straightforward to see that @xmath150 on extending the summation over @xmath124 to infinity .",
    "we establish the claim using a simple argument involving exponential sums .    breaking the sum over @xmath151 into residue classes modulo @xmath137",
    "we find that @xmath152 the contribution from @xmath153 is clearly @xmath154 which is satisfactory .",
    "likewise one finds that the contribution from non - zero @xmath155 is @xmath156 where @xmath157 the exponential sum @xmath158 satisfies a basic multiplicativity property in @xmath80 rendering it sufficient to understand when @xmath80 is a prime power . in this way one",
    "easily concludes that @xmath159 .",
