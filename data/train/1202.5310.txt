    "the formation history of the milky way is recorded in the present motions and chemical abundances of its stars . ideally , to unravel the milky way s history , we would like a catalog containing spatial , kinematical , and chemical data for every star in the galaxy .",
    "large - scale photometric surveys , such as the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , are bringing us closer to this goal : both have led to sweeping views of the structure of the galaxy .",
    "star counts from these surveys allow for detailed studies of the structure of each galactic component ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the present study looks at the spectroscopic properties of a sample of relatively nearby ( @xmath6 9 kpc ) m giant stars at mid - galactic latitudes of @xmath7 selected from the 2mass catalog .",
    "m giants ( 1 ) are intrinsically bright stars and , hence , can be easily observed to large distances using even small telescopes ; ( 2 ) can be readily identified on the basis of near - infrared , @xmath8 photometry and complete samples can be culled from full - sky catalogs ( e.g. , 2mass ) ; and ( 3 ) are limited to more metal - rich populations . these unique properties of m giants , when combined with the adopted latitude and magnitude selection criteria , make our survey particularly useful for exploring the structure of the thick disk and the metal - rich component of the nearby halo .    in this first paper describing our survey , we present the photometric and spectroscopic data for our current thick - disk dominated sample of 1799 stars , but focus on the detection and interpretation of those stars that do not kinematically conform to the typical behavior of the milky way thick disk population and are likely to be members of the stellar halo .",
    "this stellar halo sample is unique compared to other halo surveys of stars in that it covers an intermediate distance range ( @xmath9 9 kpc ) and concentrates on a relatively rare halo tracer .",
    "for example , our survey volume is wider than that of the hipparcos survey of the sun s closest neighbors ( @xmath10100 pc - * ? ? ? * ) as well as kinematically - selected solar neighborhood surveys @xcite but is a much more local view of the stellar halo than the sdss f - g type turnoff stars ( visible to 20 - 40 kpc - * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) or the entire 2mass m giant catalog ( visible out to 100 kpc - * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our catalog is comparable in probed distances to the spectroscopic studies of the century survey galactic halo project @xcite , rave @xcite , and @xcite , although these studies employed different , more commonly used halo tracers : blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars ; stars  both dwarfs and giants  with @xmath11 ; and main sequence turnoff ( msto ) stars or dwarfs from the sdss dr7 calibration sample , respectively .",
    "in this first analysis of our survey we explore the origin of the m giant population in the nearby stellar halo .",
    "there are three broad categories of formation scenarios typically postulated for halo stars :    1 .   _ in - situ - halo _ stars form at comparable radii to their current locations within the dominant dark matter halo progenitor of the galaxy .",
    "for example @xcite envisioned the stellar halo could be formed from infalling gas , prior to the formation of the disk , during an early monolithic collapse phase for our galaxy , as seen in the hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite .",
    "kicked - out _ stars are formed initially more concentrated towards the center of the dominant dark matter halo , within either the bulge or disk , and are subsequently ejected to more eccentric orbits through minor or major mergers , as proposed by @xcite and seen in hydrodynamical simulations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "( note that there were many earlier studies of this same process that focused on the thickening or destruction of disks rather than the formation of the stellar halo , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) 3 .   _ accreted _ stars form in separate dark matter halos that later merge with the galaxy ( as proposed by e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    note that in prior theoretical work , the first two categories were both simply termed _ in situ _ to indicate more generally stars formed in the dominant galaxy dark matter halo progenitor ( as in , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "separate terms are introduced here for clarity .",
    "many prior studies have probed these formation mechanisms by looking at the distribution of stars in different dimensions of phase - space .",
    "for example , the importance of an _ accreted _ population has traditionally been assessed by looking for residual groupings that are signatures of stars original associations whereas _ in - situ - halo _ or _ kicked - out _ populations are expected to be more smoothly distributed .",
    "all - sky photometric surveys have revealed rich substructure in the outer halo ( e.g. , sgr tidal tails - majewski et al .",
    "2003 ; the anticenter tributaries - grillmair 2006 ; the orphan stream - belokurov et al .",
    "2007 ) that can best be explained by accretion events ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , merger debris in the _ nearby _ halo fully phase - mix on a much shorter timescale , leading to the expectation of negligible evidence for accretion identifiable as coherent spatial structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and requiring additional dimensions of phase - space data to distinguish formation scenarios in this region . adding the dimension of line - of - sight velocities helps : conservation of phase - space density during phase - mixing",
    "requires that as debris from accretion events becomes less dense with time , it should become colder in velocity ( liouville s theorem ; see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and coherent structures may be apparent even once stars are smoothly distributed in space .",
    "indeed , substructure in velocities is apparent statistically over a large volume in bhb stars in the sdss survey ( and shown to be broadly consistent with model stellar halos built within a hierarchical cosmology  see xue et al .",
    "2010 , cooper et al .",
    "2011 ) and individual clumps in velocity have also been detected in the halo using metal - poor msto stars in the segue survey @xcite , k giant stars @xcite , as well as in the mixed populations in rave @xcite .",
    "overall , group finding is more effective if even more dimensions of phase - space can be measured .",
    "for example , @xcite analyzed proper motions for a sample of 250 f - k dwarfs in the direction of the north galactic pole that probes out to roughly 8 kpc ; he measured a mean retrograde rotational velocity for the halo sample and detected a more coherent retrograde group of stars at a mean height above the galactic plane of @xmath12 kpc  findings suggestive of an accreted halo population .",
    "subsequently , @xcite obtained radial velocities for a subsample of stars from the @xcite survey and found a significant amount of phase - space clumpiness in their halo sample .",
    "once all six phase - space dimensions are known , conserved ( or nearly conserved ) quantities ( such as energy , angular momentum , or orbital frequencies ) can be calculated that can link stars from a common progenitor in the volume even if they are not at the same orbital phase , as has been done successfully for several nearby surveys ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the findings in the previous paragraph point to a significant fraction , and possibly the majority of the stellar halo being _ accreted _ , some contributions from _ in - situ - halo _ and _ kicked - out _ stars are still possible . structural , orbital and/or metallicity trends in the stellar halo with radius  as well as transitions in those trends  have historically been taken as indicative of these different formation mechanisms and leading to `` dual halo '' models ( e.g. , in rr lyraes , globular clusters and bhb stars , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .",
    "@xcite analyzed a kinematically unbiased sample of 1203 stars with [ fe / h]@xmath3 - 0.6 in the inner halo ( within 4 kpc of the sun ) and detected a gradient in the rotational velocity as a function of height above the galactic plane for the more metal - rich stars in their sample  as seen for the _ in - situ - halo _ stars formed in the simulations of @xcite .",
    "@xcite also confirm the existence of the streams detected by @xcite  further supporting some presence of an _ accreted _ population in this region .",
    "@xcite studied the kinematics and metallicities of sdss calibration stars for a larger volume ( 20 kpc ) and found evidence for two populations : one of metal - rich stars on only mildly eccentric orbits ( which they dubbed `` inner halo '' ) and a second of metal - poor stars on more eccentric orbits ( which they dubbed `` outer halo '' ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite analyzed bhb stars in sdss ( a sample that probes the outer halo to 40 kpc ) and find a net retrograde rotation for metal - poor stars and a net prograde rotation for metal - rich stars .",
    "such multi - component halos with distinct formation mechanisms for each component emerge naturally in the hydrodynamical simulations , with the inner halo ( within 10 - 15 kpc ) coming predominantly from stars ( either _ in - situ - halo _ or _ kicked - out _ ) formed within the main galaxy dark matter halo progenitor and the outer halo ( dominant beyond 15 - 20 kpc ) from mergers and accretion of stars by the galactic dark matter halo @xcite .",
    "however , whether the distinct components observed in the stellar halo are indeed due to distinct formation mechanisms , and not merely a variety of accretion events , has yet to be proven .    in our own survey ,",
    "the sample of stars is sufficiently far that distance and proper motion errors from extant data are too large to estimate their orbital properties accurately .",
    "however , chemical abundances can be derived from high - resolution spectra in general , and thus provide an alternate avenue for exploring the origins of the stars .",
    "a star is branded at its birth by its chemical abundance patterns  a signature that is generally conserved throughout its lifetime ( like orbital properties ) and can not be diluted by orbital phase - mixing .",
    "moreover , stars deriving from a common origin should have similarities in their chemical abundance patterns , trends that are directly correlated to the details of their enrichment history .",
    "hence we can hope to `` chemically tag '' stars as members of the different populations via their abundance patterns ( similar in spirit to freeman & bland - hawthorn s 2002 proposal for the reconstruction of ancient star - clusters in the stellar disk ) .",
    "the potential power of chemical tagging has already been demonstrated empirically in observations : in dwarf galaxies , for example , stars tend to have lower [ @xmath13/fe ] at a given [ fe / h ] than stars in the bulk of the milky way s stellar halo @xcite and similar patterns have been seen in stars in stellar structures such as the monoceros ring @xcite and triangulum - andromeda cloud @xcite , which lends support to the interpretation of such features as originating from disrupted dwarf galaxies . in a similar manner ,",
    "a series of papers @xcite have separated a sample of 94 nearby ( within @xmath2335 pc of the sun ) , metal rich ( -1.6 @xmath3 [ fe / h ] @xmath3 -0.4 ) stars into `` @xmath13-rich '' and `` @xmath13-poor '' groups and shown systematic differences in the abundances , ages and orbital properties of stars in these two groups that are suggestive of _ kicked - out _ and _ accreted _ origins , respectively .",
    "figure [ cartoon ] shows two cartoons to illustrate conceptually how this approach might be applied to our own sample .",
    "the lines in the left hand panel show the expected temporal evolution , in the [ @xmath13/fe]-[fe / h ] plane , of the gaseous chemical abundance for systems with low / intermediate / high star formation efficiencies ( sfes - indicated by lines with increasingly dark shades of gray ) , which are assumed to correspond to stellar systems embedded in small / intermediate / large dark matter potential wells ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these systems could represent , for example : a milky way dwarf spheroidal ( low sfe corresponding to low mass accreted systems ) , the lmc ( intermediate sfe corresponding to intermediate mass accreted systems ) , and a milky way progenitor ( high sfe and contributing to populations either formed _ in situ _ or _ kicked out _ from their original birth places ) .",
    "all of these systems are expected to have old stars with high [ @xmath13/fe ] at low metallicity , which reflect the yields from explosive type ii sne alone .",
    "stars formed after the ( delayed ) onset of type ia sne will become progressively more enriched by fe and acquire lower [ @xmath13/fe ] as type ia sne produce @xmath13-elements much less efficiently .",
    "the transition point in fe between the early and late stages reflects the metallicity that the gas has reached prior to the onset of type ia enrichment , which will be lower / higher for systems that have less / more rapidly converted their gas into stars .",
    "the right hand panel of figure [ cartoon ] applies this intuition to show where populations with different origins might fall in this plane ( these regions are defined more rigorously and empirically in figure [ tag ] and discussed in  [ interp ] using data from previous studies ) .",
    "the region outlined in blue should contain stars formed early ( because of their low metallicities and high [ @xmath13/fe ] ) but that can now be in the halo via any of the three mechanisms ( _ in - situ - halo _ , _ kicked - out _ , or _ accreted _ ) , and thus we do not anticipate being able to conclusively deduce their origins from this particular type of analysis .",
    "the region outlined in green is likely only to contain stars formed more recently ( because of the low [ @xmath13/fe ] ) in small potential wells ( because of the low fe ) and hence should be sensitive to a purely _ accreted _ population .",
    "the region outlined in orange is likely only to contain stars formed more recently ( because of the low [ @xmath13/fe ] ) in deep potential wells ( because of the high fe ) and hence should be _ in_sensitive to _ in - situ - halo _ populations ( formed exclusively early on ) as well as the majority of _ accreted _ populations ( because they form in smaller potential wells  although , note , there could be some contamination from high - mass , late accreted systems , as suggested in figure [ tag ] ) .",
    "stars that have formed recently in the galactic disk and that were subsequently _ kicked - out _ might lie in this region ( see * ? ? ? * for an illustration of this idea with hydrodynamical cosmological simulations ) .",
    "overall , these expectations lead us to conclude that the fraction of our halo stars in the metal - poor and @xmath13-poor region is an indicator of the importance of late accretion , while the fraction with disk - like abundances but moving at large speed relative to the sun is indicative of the contribution of a recently _ kicked - out _ population .",
    "thus an additional advantage of focusing on abundance space as a probe of the relative proportions by origin of m giants in the stellar halo is that we only need to look for the expected systematic differences in the chemical composition of these populations ( _ in - situ - halo _ , _ kicked - out _ , and _ accreted _ ) overall rather than ( for example ) search for kinematical groupings from individual accretion events .",
    "hence , we can explore formation scenarios with much smaller samples of stars than by looking at dynamics alone .",
    "motivated by the promise of chemical abundances , which we could combine with the known rvs we already have for all program stars , we obtained high - resolution echelle spectra for 34 stars selected for follow - up based upon their high , halo - like speeds relative to the disk .",
    "as a control sample we also observed five random thick disk red giants ( chosen based on rvs similar to the bulk thick disk trend ) and four m giant calibration stars from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way . in  [ prog ] , we describe target selection , observations , and data reduction for the medium - resolution spectroscopy program of bright m giants .",
    "the rvs and the identification of rv outliers  stars that have high speeds relative to the bulk thick disk trend  are presented in  [ rvs ] .",
    "details of the high - resolution follow - up spectroscopy program are given in  [ hires ] .",
    "our interpretation of the abundance data in terms of formation scenarios for the halo is given in ",
    "[ interp ] .",
    "lastly , we give a summary of the results and discuss them in the context of prior studies in  [ conc ] . in a companion paper @xcite , we develop a more complete understanding of the nature and implications of some possible dynamical groups in our survey by generating and analyzing synthetic observations of simulated stellar halos .",
    "m giants can be distinguished from m dwarfs by their @xmath14 and @xmath15 colors @xcite .",
    "m giants also dominate m dwarfs in catalogs of late - type stars to @xmath1614 .",
    "these facts were used by @xcite to select m giants from 2mass and map the streams of m giants from the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy and by @xcite and @xcite to map and track the triangulum - andromeda star cloud , the pisces overdensity , and the monoceros / gass / argo feature .",
    "our survey sample spans @xmath17 colors from @xmath18 ; this is similar to the range studied by @xcite in their study of the thick disk using red giants , although most ( 96% ) of our red giants have @xmath19 ( as in majewski et al .",

    "a constraint in galactic latitude of @xmath7 was applied to our m giant catalog , with the lower limit in @xmath22 applied to avoid excess contamination from the thin disk .",
    "our nominal photometric sample contained approximately 12,000 stars , and in this paper we present spectroscopic observations for 1799 , or roughly 15% of these .",
    "the stars observed were selected randomly from the nominal sample and cover nearly all galactic longitudes .",
    "the bulk of the observing was done at the fan mountain observatory ( fmo ) , located in virginia , so there are gaps in coverage corresponding to the southern hemisphere . of the 1799 stars ,",
    "149 were observed at cerro - tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) as part of a related program .",
    "figure [ lb ] shows in an aitoff projection the spatial distribution of the 1799 program stars in galactic coordinates .",
    "the nominal m giant catalog was matched to the ucac2 catalog @xcite and the gap in the northern galactic hemisphere is due to the upper limit of @xmath23 in the ucac2 catalog at the time of the survey inception .",
    "however , the very small amplitudes of the ucac2 proper motions for the majority of the program stars typically result in unreasonably large relative errors ( often larger than the derived space motions ) in any derived kinematical parameters using them , so the proper motions are not actually utilized in the present work .",

    "accreted_. however , the presence of 17 stars in the _ accreted _ region of the abundance plane , which is populated only during the later stages of chemical evolution in a system , suggests that there also must be some stars _ accreted _ from the same systems in the main galactic halo region .",
    "this implies that there are less than 9 _ in - situ - halo _ stars in our sample . *",
    "eight rv outliers fall along the high - metallicity galactic disk trend ( to the right of the dotted line and shown as filled green squares ) .",
    "the combination of disk - like chemistry but extreme kinematics for these stars suggest membership of the _ kicked - out _ population",
    ". however , they could be a contaminating contribution from either : ( i ) a high mass accreted satellite ( like sgr or the lmc ) ; or ( ii ) the true galactic disk .    these tentative population assignments for the program m giants are given in the last column of table 1 , where ` is ' refers to _ in - situ - halo _ , ` ko ' refers to _ kicked - out _ , and ` a ' refers to the _ accreted _ population .",
    "the five stars with an origin of ` d ' are red giant thick disk calibration stars , selected based on the fact that their medium - resolution rvs fall along the main thick disk rv trend in figure [ rvcosb_3pan ]",

    "we characterize the motions of the disk population in our m giant sample by finding the value of the asymmetric drift @xmath76 ( apparent in the sinusoidal trend in the top panel of figure [ rvcosb_3pan ] ) that minimizes the dispersion @xmath77 of @xmath78 calculated ( iteratively , using a 3-@xmath79 clipping method to remove outliers ) for the medium - resolution heliocentric radial velocities .",
    "figure [ vasymm ] shows @xmath80 for @xmath81 km s@xmath25 , which was found to give the minimum @xmath82 km s@xmath25 .",

    "in fact , there are 113 stars in our medium - resolution sample with such high @xmath84 , which suggests that the majority of these are members of another population ( i.e. , the stellar halo ) .",
    "this suggests that 22/113=19.5% is a rough upper bound to the fraction of our rv outliers that are true galactic disk members .",
    "since there are 24 stars in our high - resolution sample with @xmath85 @xmath86 131.3 km s@xmath25 , we estimate at most 5 of these could be true disk members .",
    "we actually find that 3 out of the 8 possible _ kicked - out _ stars have @xmath85 @xmath86 2.5 @xmath77 ( with 2 more falling on the border , as seen in figure [ vasymm ] ) ; thus , we can not claim any conclusive evidence of kicked - out stars in our high - resolution rv outlier sample .",
    "overall , we conclude that rv outliers in our m giant sample appear to be dominated by _ accreted _ stars ( more than 17 ) , with a possible contribution from _ in situ _ stars .",
    "in this study , we have analyzed the spectroscopic properties of a sample of m giants that are dominated by members of the milky way s thick disk and nearby halo components . from the rv distribution , we identified stars with rvs that lie outside those expected for typical thick disk stars at the same locations .",
    "these rv outliers are found to show some degree of spatial and kinematical coherence .",
    "we suppose that some of this coherence could be the signature of substructure ( e.g. , tidal tails ) from accreted satellites .",
    "to test our interpretation of the rv outliers , we looked at the chemical abundance patterns of 34 of these stars .",
    "we used the locations of the stars in the [ ti / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] plane to attempt to assign them to one of three potential populations of halo stars  those formed _ in situ _ , those that were _ accreted _ , and those that were _ kicked out _ of the disk .",
    "this can not be done unambiguously in all cases because of expected overlaps in the chemical signatures of these populations . however , the [ ti / fe ] abundances for seventeen of the rv outliers are systematically below the main halo trend and similar to the abundances seen in stars from milky way dwarf satellite galaxies .",
    "they are consistent with stars from mw dwarf satellite galaxies that have been _ accreted _ by the milky way @xcite and inconsistent with expectations for abundance patterns from pure _ in - situ - halo _ or _ kicked - out _ growth .",
    "another eight of the stars selected for high - resolution spectroscopic follow - up track the abundance trends set by the disk stars , even though they have halo - like kinematics .",
    "these are indicative of a population formed in the disk or bulge and subsequently _ kicked - out _ , although : ( i ) some or all may have been _ accreted _ from a high - mass infalling object ; and ( ii ) we estimate an upper limit to contamination by genuine disk stars even at these high rvs at a level that does not allow this association to be conclusive .",
    "the remainder of the high - resolution stars have high [ ti / fe ] at low [ fe / h ] and could be part of any of the _ in - situ - halo _ , _ kicked - out _ or the _ accreted _ populations .      while it has had a long history @xcite , the discussion of possible multiple mechanisms for the formation of the stellar halo has been revitalized in recent years both by the advent of large photometric data sets with follow - up low - resolution spectroscopic work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and more modest , but ever - expanding samples of nearby halo stars with high - resolution spectroscopy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in several cases , the studies point out classes of halo populations with distinct properties that are argued to match expectations for the properties of populations with distinct formation histories seen in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation : the models generally predict an inner halo ( within @xmath220 - 30 kpc ) dominated by metal - rich stars formed within the main galactic progenitor and an outer halo dominated by lower - metallicity , accreted stars @xcite",
    ". however , comparisons of the models to the data sets up to this point are necessarily inconclusive because the results of the simulations themselves are dependent on the ( hard to model ! ) details of when , how , and where stars form in the main galactic progenitor .",
    "for example , @xcite claim evidence for two populations in their sample of 10,123 nearby ( within 4 kpc ) sdss calibration stars : one of metal - rich stars ( with a metallicity distribution peaking around [ fe / h]= -1.6 ) on only mildly eccentric orbits and a second of metal - poor stars on more eccentric orbits .",
    "these observations are very reminiscent of the hydrodynamical simulation results  indeed @xcite _ interpret _ their metal - rich stars as an inner , _ in - situ - halo_/_kicked - out _ population and their metal - poor stars as an outer , _ accreted _ population  but a transition in the orbital and metallicity properties in these populations is not necessarily inconsistent with a purely accreted stellar halo .",
    "moreover , the @xcite interpretation is at odds with our finding of a large fraction of clearly accreted stars in our m giant sample of even higher metallicity stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath86 -1.2 ) than their metal - rich population .",
    "in fact , we might expect the m giants to be biased _ towards _ finding _ in - situ - halo_/_kicked - out _ stars because late - type giants are a metal - rich stellar population . on the other hand ,",
    "the selection of rv outliers admits a bias in our sample towards the high velocity tails of all populations  particularly _ accreted _ stars , which are expected typically to be on higher energy and higher eccentricity orbits than the other stars .",
    "this could explain why our sample is particularly sensitive to the accreted population .",
    "further work is needed to definitively show which of these two biases should dominate in a sample such as ours .",
    "our results are more similar to those of @xcite and @xcite , who find roughly equal - size populations distinct in age , abundances and orbits when they divide their ( metal - rich , [ fe / h ] @xmath86 -1.6 ) stellar halo sample between low-@xmath13 and high-@xmath13 stars in the [ mg / fe]-[fe / h ] plane .",
    "they interpret the properties of the low-@xmath13 population ( in which the stars are found also to be younger and on more eccentric orbits ) as being consistent with an accreted population  so that these authors find an accreted fraction for the stellar halo at these metallicities similar to our own estimates .",
    "it is interesting to note that we also find stars with significantly lower [ @xmath13/fe ] ( less than zero ) than any of the stars in the @xcite sample , possibly because our large survey volume ( out to 9 kpc from the sun ) encompasses debris from more chemically extreme accreted progenitors not represented in their local sample ( which is limited to within 335 pc of the sun ) .",
    "we explore the properties of relatively nearby , rv - selected halo m giant stars and conclude that the chemical properties of the stars in this sample show tentative evidence of distinct populations with distinct formation mechanisms . while close to 50% of the stars fall in the _ accreted _ region of chemical abundance space , a definitive assessment of the relative contributions from _ in - situ - halo_/_kicked - out _ stars is not possible , due to the sometimes ambiguous categorizations of stars based upon their [ @xmath13/fe]-[fe / h ] abundance distributions alone . @xcite",
    "have demonstrated that using abundance patterns along with more complete orbital information can play a key role in making this identification .",
    "our own chemodynamical data point to the importance of mapping a significant volume of the halo to confirm that such local studies are representative of global properties .",
    "follow - up work on the kinematics and more detailed chemical characterization of these stars would give more insight into their origin . quantifying the size of the _ kicked - out _ population",
    "more generally could provide valuable constraints on the hydrodynamical models of galaxy formation .",
    "a key finding is that our selection of m giants with unusual , halo - like rvs picks out a stellar halo population dominated by _ accreted _ stars .",
    "hence , searching for accretion events in rv - outlying samples of m giants should be prolific and motivates further interest in the putative groupings of stars found in our rv survey . in a companion paper",

    "<S> we present a medium - resolution spectroscopic survey of late - type giant stars at mid - galactic latitudes of ( 30@xmath060@xmath1 ) , designed to probe the properties of this population to distances of @xmath29 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> because m giants are generally metal - rich and we have limited contamination from thin disk stars by the latitude selection , most of the stars in the survey are expected to be members of the thick disk ( @xmath3[fe / h]@xmath4 - 0.6 ) with some contribution from the metal - rich component of the nearby halo .    here </S>",
    "<S> we report first results for 1799 stars . the distribution of radial velocity ( rv ) as a function of @xmath5 for these stars shows ( 1 ) the expected thick disk population and ( 2 ) local metal - rich halo stars moving at high speeds relative to the disk , that in some cases form distinct sequences in rv-@xmath5 space . </S>",
    "<S> high - resolution echelle spectra taken for 34 of these `` rv outliers '' reveal the following patterns across the [ ti / fe]-[fe / h ] plane : seventeen of the stars have abundances reminiscent of the populations present in dwarf satellites of the milky way ; eight have abundances coincident with those of the galactic disk and more metal - rich halo ; and nine of the stars fall on the locus defined by the majority of stars in the halo . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical abundance trends of the rv outliers suggest that this sample consists predominantly of stars accreted from infalling dwarf galaxies . a smaller fraction of stars in the rv outlier sample may have been formed in the inner galaxy and subsequently kicked to higher eccentricity orbits , but the sample is not large enough to distinguish conclusively between this interpretation and the alternative that these stars represent the tail of the velocity distribution of the thick disk . </S>",
    "<S> our data do not rule out the possibility that a minority of the sample could have formed from gas _ in situ _ on their current orbits . </S>",
    "<S> these results are consistent with scenarios where the stellar halo , at least as probed by m giants , arises from multiple formation mechanisms ; however , when taken at face value , our results for metal - rich halo giants suggest a much higher proportion to be accreted than found by @xcite and more like the fraction suggested in the analysis by @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that m giants with large rvs can provide particularly fruitful samples to mine for accreted structures and that some of the velocity sequences may indeed correspond to real physical associations resulting from recent accretion events . </S>"
