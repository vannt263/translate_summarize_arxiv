    "the cosmic censorship conjecture , which is widely believed to be true , put forward by penrose @xcite thirty years ago has become the corner stone of general relativity .",
    "moreover , it is being envisaged as a basic principle of nature . the conjecture ( in its weak form )",
    "asserts that no physically reasonable matter field can give rise to singularities which are observable from asymptotic regions of the space - time .",
    "according to the strong version of the conjecture , such singularities are invisible to all observers , i.e. , there occurs no naked singularities for any observer , even someone close to it .",
    "however , despite the flurry of activity over the years , the validity of this conjecture is still an open question and very far from being settled . in view of this , it is certainly worthwhile exercise to search for examples which appear to violate the conjecture ( for recent reviews and reference on conjecture , see @xcite ) .",
    "there are of course number of solutions of einstein s equations , in , which admit naked singularities ( see , e.g. , @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "this happens in the gravitational collapse of different geometrical configuration and various types of matter .",
    "those received most attention , and which can arise from regular initial data , are generated in self - similar collapse @xcite .",
    "the self - similar models may be refer to highly symmetric and specialized situation .",
    "but the self - similarity is interesting to study as it reduces einstein s field equations to a system of ordinary differential equations and it may simplify physical interpretation of models .    in recent years",
    ", superstring and field theories provoked great interest among theoretical physicists in studying physics of higher dimensions @xcite and hence significant efforts have been expended to study gravitational collapse models in higher dimensions ( hd ) @xcite but only a few , for example see @xcite , have studied these problems from viewpoint of the cosmic censorship conjecture .",
    "it is shown that a naked singularity forms in the hd spherical collapse of null radiation @xcite and of dust as well @xcite",
    ". however , these models neglect pressure which is likely to play important role in final outcome of the collapse .",
    "ori and piran @xcite , in 4d case , have studied numerically self - similar collapse of an adiabatic perfect fluid and have shown that with a soft equation of state the collapse can give rise to a naked singularity @xcite .",
    "this was followed by analytical discussions of spherical collapse of perfect fluid under assumption of self - similarity @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study gravitational collapse of perfect fluid in hd space - times .",
    "there is some literature on hd perfect fluid collapse @xcite from the viewpoint of the conjecture .",
    "however , these studies are restricted to 5d space - time and can not be reduced to the 4d case .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to generalize analytical studies , of self - similar collapse of adiabatic perfect fluid collapse , in 4d to @xmath0-dimensional space - times ( where @xmath1 ) and to show that previous results of gravitational collapse , obtained in 4d space - time , are also valid in hd space - time .",

    "do they always become covered ? does the nature of the singularity change ?",
    "our analysis shows that none of the above hold .",
    "infact , the gravitational collapse of perfect fluid in hd self - similar spherically symmetric space - times lead to strong curvature globally naked singularities .",
