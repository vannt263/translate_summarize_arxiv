    "high accuracy of modern eas experiments in the primary energy region of @xmath0 ev [ 1 - 4 ] increased a number of publications on the solutions of the eas inverse problem , which is reconstruction of primary nuclei energy spectra based on the detected eas parameters at observation level [ 5 - 9 ] .",
    "however , discrepancies in results continue to grow . in most of the cases ,",
    "it is a result of the hidden experimental systematic errors due to uncertainties in the response functions of detectors .",
    "the uncertainty of a - a interaction model at these energies also contributes to the discrepancies in primary nuclei energy spectra results",
    ". however , there are certain publications where the eas inverse problem is solved based on erroneous presuppositions , which of course only increase the existing discrepancies of data .",
    "in general , the relation between energy spectra ( @xmath1 ) of primary nuclei ( @xmath2 ) and measured eas electron and muon size spectra at observation level ( @xmath3 ) at a given zenith angle @xmath4 is determined by an integral equation @xmath5 the kernel function of equation ( 1 ) is determined as @xmath6 where the eas size spectra @xmath7 depend on observation level , @xmath8 parameters of primary nucleus and @xmath9 interaction model , @xmath10 is the error function of measurements .",
    "+ equation ( 1 ) is a typical ill - posed problem and has an infinite set of solutions for unknown primary energy spectra .",
    "however , the integral equation ( 1 ) turns to a fredholm equation if a kind of a primary nucleus is defined directly in the experiment ( as it successfully does in the balloon and satellite measurements @xcite where energy spectra for different nuclei are obtained up to @xmath0 ev ) or the detected eas parameters ( or combination of parameters ) slightly depend on primary nuclei @xcite . in the last case one",
    "evaluate only the all - particle energy spectra @xmath11 from equation ( 1 ) .",
    "+ as a result , the meaning of data presented in the @xcite and further publications [ 12 - 14 ] where authors claim to have got the solution of equation ( 1 ) for 4 types of primary nuclei , is not clear .",
    "+ let s prove that using the measured eas electron and truncated muon size spectra at 3 zenith angular intervals , as its done in @xcite , the eq .",
    "( 1 ) can have a single solution only for primary flux which consists of not more than 2 kinds of nuclei .",
    "+ let the eas size spectra at observation level kascade ( @xmath12 g/@xmath13 @xcite ) be described by log - gaussian distributions with mean @xmath14 and variance @xmath15 .",
    "it is known that this assumption is well performed at atmosphere depth @xmath16 g/@xmath13 , primary energies @xmath17 gev and zenith angles @xmath18 .",
    "+ let also the measurements and further evaluations of eas electron and truncated muon sizes be carried out without errors ( @xmath19 ) and integral eq .",
    "( 1 ) include only statistical uncertainties .",
    "+ then a set of eq .",
    "( 1 ) transforms into the following : @xmath20 let s determine the parameters of distribution functions @xmath21 by the following known empirical expressions : @xmath22 @xmath23 where the values of corresponding approximation parameters ( @xmath24 ) are presented in tables 1,2 and obtained by corsika6016(nkg ) eas simulation code @xcite at qgsjet interaction model @xcite .",
    ".approximation parameters of average eas electron size ( @xmath25 ) and eas truncated muon size ( @xmath26 ) in empirical formula ( 4 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the accuracy of approximation ( 4 ) for average eas electron size @xmath27 is less than 10@xmath28 at @xmath29 gev , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and observation level 1020 g/@xmath13 .",
    "the corresponding accuracies of @xmath32 and average eas truncated muon size @xmath26 are less than 1 - 2@xmath28 .",
    "+ changing the variables of kernel functions of eq .",
    "( 3 ) from @xmath25 and @xmath26 to @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively according to @xmath35 we obtain the following set of fredholm integral equations    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and kernel functions @xmath38 independent of kind of primary nuclei .",
    "+ examples of distribution functions @xmath39 for eas electron and truncated muon size spectra are presented fig .",
    "1,2 respectively .",
    "these data were obtained by corsika code for primary proton ( @xmath40 , empty symbols ) and iron ( @xmath41 , filled symbols ) nuclei at energy @xmath42 gev and zenith angle @xmath43 .",
    "the lines in fig .  1,2 correspond to log - gaussian distributions which were counted based on known values of mean @xmath44 and variances @xmath45 .",
    "+ it is seen , that the distribution functions slightly depend on a kind of a primary nucleus , especially the right - hand sides of distributions .",
    "it is an important fact , because the contribution of the left - hand sides of distributions is negligible small at _ a priori _ steep primary energy spectra ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "+ let the functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 be the solutions of the set of fredholm equations ( 7 ) at @xmath49 values of primary energies @xmath50 , @xmath51 kinds of primary nuclei and k=1,2,3 zenith angles .",
    "then the values of unknown energy spectra ( @xmath52 ) at a given set of @xmath53 and different primary nuclei ( @xmath54 ) are determined by the set of linear equations @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57 + evidently , the single solutions of linear equations ( 9,10 ) occur only at @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a number of unknown @xmath60 and @xmath61 is a number of equations ( 10,11 )",
    ". +    therefore the condition of existence of solutions is @xmath62 and the energy spectra @xcite obtained based on kascade eas electron and truncated muon size spectra for 4 ( @xmath63 ) primary nuclei no physical meaning . at the same time the all - particle spectrum obtained in @xcite have to be approximately right due to the power index in eq .  ( 11 ) @xmath64 .",
    "+ it should be noted that unreliability of solutions @xcite is also shown in @xcite based on correlation analysis between the observable electron and truncated muon size spectra and unknown energy spectra of primary nuclei . +",
    "based on equation ( 1 ) , the investigation of the eas inverse problem , which is the reconstruction of energy spectra of primary nuclei by the observable eas electron and muon size spectra at observation level makes sense only using _ a priori _ given functions for unknown primary energy spectra with given unknown spectral parameters ( so called parameterization of equation ( 1 ) ) as it is done in @xcite .",
