    "the concept of visible singularities is objectionable to many scientists , as their existence is thought to have alarming astrophysical implications . on the other hand",
    ", a failure of the wcch will give us the great opportunity to probe the extremely strong gravitational fields that will help in the discovery of the physical laws of quantum gravity . despite many industrious efforts , we are still far from having a general proof ( or disproof ) of this hypothesis , and penrose @xcite expected that radically new mathematical techniques might be required for this purpose .",
    "as a proof or disproof of this hypothesis appears to be inordinately difficult , it may be easier to find a persuading counterexample to demonstrate that the hypothesis is not correct .",
    "numerous diligent efforts have been put in this direction in the last four decades ; however , we still do not have a single convincing counterexample to the wcch ( see references in @xcite ) . in a seminal review ,",
    "penrose @xcite concluded that the question of the cosmic censorship is still very much open and considered this to be possibly the most important unsolved problem in classical general relativity .",

    "they used this lens equation to study the gravitational lensing due to light deflection close to the photon sphere of the supermassive `` black hole '' at the center of the galaxy .",

    "the schwarzschild black holes as well as weakly naked singularities have qualitatively similar lensing characteristics : both have one einstein ring and no radial critical curves . on the other hand , the strongly naked singularities have qualitatively different lensing features , i.e. , they give rise to two or none einstein rings and one radial critical curve .",
    "after publication of these results @xcite , there has been a growing curiosity in black hole lensing and many interesting papers have appeared in last few years ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in this paper , we study the time delay , magnification centroid , and total magnification of images due to gravitational lensing by schwarzschild black holes and janis - newman - winicour naked singularities .",

    "the differential time delays are always positive .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the negative and positive time delays are respectively not necessarily due to negative and positive bending angles .",
    "a light ray with a positive deflection angle may give rise to positive or negative time delays , and the same is true for a light ray with a negative deflection angle . if @xmath8 increases , the angular separation between images on the same side as the source increases ( the inner and outer images move respectively toward and away from the optical axis ) .",
    "however , the angular separation between images on the opposite side from the source decreases ( the outer and inner images move respectively toward and away from the optical axis ) and for some value of @xmath8 these two images coalesce to form one highly magnified image ; for example , for @xmath116 , the angular positions of the source and image are @xmath117   arcseconds ( rc ) and @xmath118 arcsecond ( rcc ) , respectively .",
    "the opposite signs on these two values show that the rcc and rc are on the opposite sides of optical axis ( see table @xmath119 ) . for further increase in @xmath8 ,",
    "there are no images on the opposite side from the source .    for @xmath120 ,",

    "the signs on rc and rcc being the same implies that this image appear on the same side as the source .",
    "as @xmath8 further increases , the image splits into two and the inner and outer ( direct ) images move toward and away from the optical axis , respectively ; the magnification of inner image decreases much faster than the outer one .",

    "thus , the presence of scalar charge helps increase the total magnification .",
    "this would provide a modest increase in the likelihood of observing lensing by sgr @xmath125 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "all the images produced by the galactic mdo ( modeled as a schwarzschild black hole and naked singularity lenses ) may be resolved from each other by observational facilities available in the near future .",
    "therefore , the results of magnification centroid and total magnification may not be needed .",
    "however , our studies help us understand the role of scalar field on the magnification centroid and total magnification , which could be useful while studying gravitational lensing by exotic dark objects having rather small value of @xmath126 .",
    "the naked singularities are classified in three categories : _ wns _ , _ msns _ , and sns .",
    "we modeled the galactic mdo as the sbh , and janis - newman - winicour wns , msns and sns lenses , and studied point source gravitational lensing by them .",
    "we found that the gravitational lensing effects due to the sbh , wns , and msns are qualitatively similar ( but these differ slightly quantitatively ) to each other ; however , they differ qualitatively from sns lensing . therefore , it will be easier to observationally differentiate a sns ( compared to a wns or a msns ) from a sbh .",
    "_ sbh , wns and msns lensing_. these do not give rise to any radial caustics ; however , they do produce one einstein ring when the lens components are aligned ( i.e. @xmath127 ) .",
    "when @xmath8 increases , the einstein ring splits into two images , one on each side of the optical axis .",
    "the time delays for both images are positive for all values of @xmath8 . for a given value of @xmath8 , a decrease in @xmath103 , i.e. , an increase in @xmath106 , decreases the absolute angular image positions , time delays , magnification centroid , and magnification centroid shift ; however , it increases the magnitude of magnifications of images and therefore also the total magnification .",
    "the differences are however very small .",
    "the deflection angle @xmath6 becomes unboundedly large as the impact parameter @xmath128 for the sbh and wns , and @xmath129 for the msns @xcite .",
    "_ sns lensing_. there are two types of lensing in this category . in the first ,",
    "for example for the case of @xmath130 , there are double concentric einstein rings ( when @xmath131 ) and one radial critical curve ( when @xmath132 arcseconds ) . as the angular position of the source increases from the alignment position of the lens components ( i.e. , @xmath131 ) , the two einstein rings `` break '' into four images , giving two images on each side of the optical axis . the separation between images on the same and opposite side from the source ,",
    "respectively , increases and decreases as @xmath8 increases , and eventually the two images on the opposite side from the source coalesce to form a single highly magnified image . for any further increase in @xmath8",
    ", there are only two images on the same side as the source .",
    "the second category of sns lensing , for example for @xmath120 , there is one rc ; however , there is no einstein ring when @xmath127 .",
    "moreover , there is no image for small values of @xmath8 .",
    "as @xmath8 increases , a highly magnified image ( rcc ) first appears on the same side as the source .",
    "a further increase in @xmath8 splits this into two images and the separation between them keeps increasing ( both images remaining on the same side as the source ) .",
    "the time delay of images of sns lensing may be positive , zero , or negative depending on the values of @xmath103 and @xmath8 .",
    "however , the time delay of a direct image is negative for any sns lensing if @xmath8 is large . as shown in @xcite , the deflection angle @xmath6 approaches @xmath133 as the impact parameter approaches its minimum value zero .",
    "therefore , if a light ray is sent radially toward a sns , it will `` bounce '' ; however , it remains to be computed whether or not the `` reflected '' light has enough magnification to be observed by present instruments or by those likely to be available in near future .",
    "this may serve as a crucial test for the existence of sns .",
    "the naked singularity lensing gives rise to images of smaller time delay and stronger magnification than the black hole lensing .",
    "therefore , if naked singularities indeed exist in nature , then these will serve as _",
    "better cosmic telescopes _ and will help probe the universe more efficiently .",
    "the results obtained in this paper also helps understand the effects of scalar field on gravitational lensing , which could have valuable implications for research in cosmology .",
    "the janis - newman - winicour metric also describes the exterior gravitational field of a scalar star .",
    "therefore , results obtained in this paper for naked singularities are also applicable to scalar stars .",
    "the scalar star however must be compact enough for the images not to be obstructed .",
    "the metric we considered in this paper may or may not be physically realistic . however , gravitational lensing studies with this metric serves as a stepping stone to understand the distinctive lensing features of black holes and naked singularities .",
    "it would be indeed of great astrophysical significance to obtain distinguishing _ qualitative _ lensing characteristics of kerr black holes and naked singularities , so that the weak cosmic censorship hypothesis could be tested observationally without any ambiguity .",

    "<S> we model the massive dark object at the center of the galaxy as a schwarzschild black hole as well as janis - newman - winicour naked singularities , characterized by the mass and scalar charge parameters , and study gravitational lensing ( particularly time delay , magnification centroid , and total magnification ) by them . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the lensing features are qualitatively similar ( though quantitatively different ) for the schwarzschild black holes , weakly naked , and marginally strongly naked singularities . </S>",
    "<S> however , the lensing characteristics of strongly naked singularities are qualitatively very different from those due the schwarzschild black holes </S>",
    "<S> . the images produced by schwarzschild black hole lenses and weakly naked and marginally strongly naked singularity lenses always have positive time delays . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the strongly naked singularity lenses can give rise to images with positive , zero , or negative time delays . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for a large angular source position the direct image ( the outermost image on the same side as the source ) due to strongly naked singularity lensing always has negative time delay . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that the scalar field decreases the time delay and increases the magnitude of magnifications of images ; this result could have important implications for cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> as the janis - newman - winicour metric also describes the exterior gravitational field of a scalar star , naked singularities as well as scalar star lenses , if these exist in nature , will serve as more efficient cosmic telescopes than regular gravitational lenses .    </S>"
