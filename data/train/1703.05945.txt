    "our analysis so far suggest that both components of the pds 11 system are of similar spectral type , m2 .",

    "intriguingly , pds 11a show lithium absorption , suggesting that it is 10@xmath015 myr old ; pds 11b do not show lithium absorption .",
    "below we discuss more aspects on veiling and binarity of this system .",
    "the presence of excess continuum emission , referred to as veiling , is often observed in classical t tauri stars @xcite . in the magnetospheric accretion model ,",
    "veiling is due to the dissipation of energy in the post - shock region at the base of the magnetic funnel , close to the stellar surface @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested a method to estimate veiling in t tauri stars .",
    "they found that measured ew values of cai @xmath24227 absorption line follow a relation with spectral type , of the form ew(cai ) = @xmath0189.218 + 7.36@xmath55 @xmath0 0.072@xmath56 .",
    "since both pds 11a and pds 11b are of m2 spectral type , ` @xmath55 ' corresponds to 60 @xcite .",
    "hence the expected cai  @xmath24227 ew should be 6.8  , if veiling is not present .",
    "in the case of pds 11a , ew(cai ) measured on 2016 february 13 agrees with the expected value , whereas it changed to 5.6@xmath190.2  , when measured from the spectra taken on 2016 march 15 . during the first epoch ,",
    "the measured ew value of cai  @xmath24227 is almost similar to that expected if veiling is not present .",
    "but in the second epoch , the line gets veiled , suggesting that emission from accretion continuum is filling - in the absorption line .",
    "the situation is even more interesting in the case of pds 11b which show ew(cai ) value of 6.0@xmath190.4 from the spectra taken on 2016 february 13 and the line is almost not visible in the spectra taken on 2016 march 15 . since the measured ew of cai  @xmath24227 is considerably lower than the empirical estimates , pds 11b must be undergoing strong veiling .",
    "we estimated the effect of veiling on spectral type determination for both the stars using the ew(cai ) relation given in @xcite .",
    "we found that the spectral type of pds 11a could change from m2 to m1 for a change in ew(cai ) from 6.8 to 5.6  . in the case of pds 11b ,",
    "the cai  @xmath24227 line is almost completely veiled and hence the spectral type can shift to earlier type by @xmath45 subtypes .    the fact that the spectra of both the stars in pds 11 are veiled has important implications .",
    "firstly , this supports our result that pds 11a and pds 11b are ctts in active accretion phase .",
    "secondly , this explains the absence of lii  @xmath26708 absorption line in pds 11b .",
    "it is quite possible that pds 11b is of the same age as pds 11a and lii  @xmath26708 is present , but the line is filled in because of strong veiling .",
    "we examined this aspect by comparing the lithium abundance values listed in @xcite with the shift in spectral type due to veiling . in the previous paragraph",
    ", we described that veiling was present in the spectrum of pds 11b obtained on 2016 february 13 , while pds 11a did not show evidence for veiling during that epoch .",
    "the equivalent width of cai  @xmath24227 in pds 11b was found to be 6  , whereas the expected value in the absence of veiling is 6.8  .",
    "this reduction in absorption strength due to veiling will shift the spectral type from m2 to m1 for pds 11b , according to the ew(cai ) relation given in @xcite .",
    "thus , based on ew(cai ) , the spectral type of pds 11b was of m1 and pds 11a of m2 type , for the epoch 2016 february 13 .",
    "the age of pds 11a is estimated in the range 10@xmath015 myr . from @xcite",
    "stellar models it is seen that at an age of 10 myr , the ratio of surface lithium abundance to initial abundance is @xmath427 times higher in an m2 star like pds 11a , when compared to m1 star like pds 11b . since we found lii  @xmath26708 absorption in pds 11a to be 0.43  , the ew(lii ) expected for pds 11b is around 0.02  .",
    "this value is far below the detection limit of our instrument , which supports our proposition that lii  @xmath26708 might be present in pds 11b , but not visible in the spectrum due to strong veiling .",
    "we have used the banyan ii webtool to check whether our candidates are associated with any of the nearby kinematic groups .",
    "banyan ii is a bayesian analysis tool which makes use of the position and space velocities of the object to assess the match with the database of nearby ( @xmath28100 pc ) moving groups , younger than 100 myr @xcite .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocity and proper motion of pds 11a and pds 11b are taken from the literature and are given in table 3 .",
    "from the analysis we found that pds 11a and pds 11b are not associated with any known moving group .",
    "banyan ii analysis gives 100% probability that pds 11a and pds 11b belong to young field population @xcite .",
    "it is quite possible that our object parameters may not match with that of any known association and hence has been ascribed to young field population .",
    "although the pds 11 system has been treated as binary in the literature @xcite , it is yet to be demonstrated that pds 11a & 11b are gravitationally bound .",
    "it has been identified as visual binaries in washington double star catalog @xcite , but that do not guarantee them being gravitationally bound .",
    "instead , we found that the proper motion in ra and dec for both the stars are similar within uncertainties ( table 3 ) .",
    "this suggests that pds 11a and pds 11b form a binary system .",
    "considering pds 11 at a distance of 114@xmath0131 pc , with a separation of 8.8@xmath7 between the components @xcite , the physical separation between pds 11a and pds 11b is @xmath4  1003@xmath01153 au .",
    "the proximity of two ctts at such a separation argues against chance alignment and suggests that they are part of a bound system .",
    "hence , the age and distance estimated for pds 11a can as well be applied to pds 11b .    from a study of t tauri stars in taurus - auriga star - forming region , @xcite obtained a relation to estimate the lifetime of the disk in t tauri stars ( @xmath57 ) , @xmath57 = 4@xmath1410@xmath58(m / m@xmath3)@xmath59 , in terms of the mass of the parent star ( m ) . since the mass of pds 11a and pds 11b are estimated to be 0.4 m@xmath3 , the disk lifetime is around 2.0 myr .",
    "evidently it is quite puzzling how a disk which harbors enough gas and dust survive in 10@xmath015 myr old system like pds 11 .",
    "t tauri binary systems with disks at ages older than the typical disk dissipation timescales have been reported in the literature .",
    "most of them belong to nearby ( @xmath28 100 pc ) young moving groups .",

    "these objects belong to class of wide binaries , where the separation between the components is in the range 1.7 kau ( for lds 5606 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to 41 kau ( for tw hya@xmath0twa 28 system , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . among them , only twa 30 and lds 5606 are t tauri binary systems in which both components are accreting .",
    "the binary components of twa 30 system are separated by @xmath43400 au , show nearly edge - on orientation and are of similar spectral type , m5 and m4 , respectively @xcite .",
    "lds 5606 is an m5/m5 t tauri binary system at a separation of @xmath41700 au and they are members of @xmath5  pic moving group @xcite .",
    "to summarize , pds 11 is the third such system , after twa 30 and lds 5606 , which belong to the interesting class of old , dusty , wide binary classical t tauri systems in which both components undergo active accretion .",
    "it is quite possible that pds 11a is a transition disk candidate since it is accreting and lacks hot dust material close to the star ( see sect .",
    "3.3 & 3.6 ) .",
    "however , further studies are needed to confirm other transition disk properties such as mid- and far - ir excess and the presence of outer disk in pds 11a .",
    "also , further observations are needed to assess whether the near - ir excess in pds 11b is entirely due to circumstellar material or due to the contribution from late - type companion .",
    "if confirmed , this would be the first known example of a @xmath6010 myr old binary system , where one of the components harbor a radially continuous full disk , while the other is surrounded by a disk with inner hole or gap .",
    "we have analyzed the star / disk properties and derived the spectral type of the t tauri binary system pds 11 from optical photometry , spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopic observations .",
    "our analysis indicates that pds 11 is the new addition , after twa 30 and lds 5606 , to the interesting class of old , dusty , wide binary classical t tauri systems in which both components are actively accreting .",
    "the main conclusions from this study are listed below .    *",
    "the spectral type of pds 11a and pds 11b were not known .",
    "we have classified both as m2-type making use of the tio @xmath27050 band feature , with the aid of tio5 index and the relations from @xcite .",
    "* pds 11a and pds 11b are found to have h@xmath1 emission strength of @xmath425   , which is higher than the threshold value of chromospherically active stars .",
    "the median accretion rate derived from h@xmath1 emission line is around @xmath4  1.0@xmath1410@xmath26 m@xmath3 yr@xmath27 for pds 11a .",
    "pds 11b show very high near- and mid - infrared excess . the emission lines of [ oi ]  @xmath26300 and hei  @xmath25876 , indicative of accretion process , are present in the spectrum of pds 11b .",
    "all these evidences conclusively prove that pds 11a and pds 11b are classical t tauri stars .",
    "it needs to be assessed from future studies how an active accretion disk sustains in a 10@xmath015 myr old system like pds 11a .",
    "* we found that pds 11a is less than 15 myr from age dating using lithium depletion boundary method .",
    "further , from the comparison of lii  @xmath26708 ew with that of young stars in moving groups , the age is constrained in the range 10@xmath015 myr . *",
    "since lii  @xmath26708 is not present in the spectrum of pds 11b , the stellar parameters other than spectral type and temperature were not determined .",
    "however , since we prove that pds 11a and pds 11b form a binary system , age and distance of pds 11b is taken to be similar to pds 11a . * from our analysis",

    "<S> the lithium doublet lii  @xmath26708 , a signature of youth , is present in the spectrum of pds 11a , but not in pds 11b . from the application of lithium depletion boundary age - dating method and a comparison with the lii  @xmath26708 equivalent width distribution of moving groups , we estimated an age of 10@xmath015 myr for pds 11a . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with pre - main sequence evolutionary models indicates that pds 11a is a 0.4 m@xmath3 t tauri star at a distance of 114@xmath0131 pc . </S>",
