    "astrophysical processes most often involve charged particle nuclear reactions at very low energies .",
    "the cross sections of such reactions decrease exponentially with decreasing energy , making their laboratory measurements extremely difficult .",
    "one of the most important reactions in nuclear astrophysics is the radiative proton capture on @xmath0be .",
    "this reaction produces @xmath2b in the sun , whose @xmath10 decay is the main source of high - energy solar neutrinos . that @xmath0be is radioactive makes the measurement of the low - energy @xmath0be(@xmath11)@xmath2b cross section even more difficult .",
    "there is a considerable spread among both the experimental ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and theoretical ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) values of the low - energy astrophysical @xmath12 factor .",
    "however , a common feature in all of these analyses is the assumption that the cross section at low energies ( @xmath13  kev ) is dominated by the @xmath14 transition .",
    "hence the extrapolated astrophysical @xmath3 factor is flat .",
    "the @xmath0li@xmath15)@xmath2be reaction was studied for energies from 0 to 80 kev by chasteler _",
    "@xcite with the hope that the somewhat easier experimental situation ( @xmath0li is stable ) might allow one to gain some insight into the similar @xmath0be(@xmath11)@xmath2b process .",
    "a considerable forward - backward asymmetry was found in the angular distribution of the emitted photons , indicating a non - negligible @xmath4 ( @xmath16-wave ) strength at such low energies . a transition - matrix element ( tme ) analysis of the data",
    "was performed , resulting in two possible values of the @xmath4 strength of 20% and 80% .",
    "it was suggested that the situation may be similar in the case of the @xmath0be(@xmath11)@xmath2b reaction .",
    "if that were so , then the lowest energy ( @xmath17 100 kev ) experimental cross section values would contain a 20% ( 80% ) @xmath4 contribution .",
    "thus , as the @xmath4 cross section becomes negligible at lower energies because of the centrifugal barrier , the @xmath3 factor would not be flat but decreasing with decreasing energy , and the zero energy @xmath12 factor would be 20% ( 80% ) smaller than currently believed .",
    "rolfs and kavanagh @xcite suggested that the observed low - energy @xmath4 strength of the @xmath0li(@xmath11)@xmath2be reaction comes from the tail of the @xmath7 state at @xmath18  kev .",
    "more recently , the astrophysical @xmath3 factor of the @xmath0li@xmath19)@xmath2be reaction was accurately measured between 100 and 1500 kev by zahnow _",
    "the data were interpreted again by assuming that the small @xmath4 contribution comes from the tail of the @xmath7 resonance .",
    "weller and chasteler @xcite pointed out that some of the formulae used in the previous analyses @xcite were incorrect , and that the resonance tail could only result in a 2% @xmath16-wave contribution , much smaller compared to the earlier estimates .",
    "barker @xcite achieved acceptable fits to the measured angular distributions and analyzing powers by attributing the @xmath16-wave @xmath4 contribution to the tails of the low - energy resonances .",
    "he obtained an @xmath4 strength of @xmath20% , again much less than that reported by chasteler _",
    "_ however , to achieve these fits , some of the spectroscopic amplitudes needed the opposite signs to those obtained from the shell model .",
    "barker also noted @xcite that the analogue of the @xmath0be(@xmath11)@xmath2b reaction in @xmath2be would be the one which leads to the @xmath21 isobaric analogue state of the ground state of @xmath2b .",
    "such a measurement was performed by godwin _",
    "_ @xcite and no indication of any low - energy @xmath4 strength was found .",
    "therefore , it may be assumed that the standard extrapolation of the @xmath0be(@xmath11)@xmath2b @xmath3 factor is correct and reliable .",
    "however , the origin of the discrepancies among the various analyses of the @xmath0li(@xmath11)@xmath2be reaction is still not understood .",
    "herein , we study the role of the @xmath4 transition in the @xmath0li@xmath19)@xmath2be reaction by using a microscopic eight - body model .",
    "our model is a microscopic multi - cluster ( @xmath22he+@xmath23h+@xmath16 ; @xmath22he+@xmath23he+@xmath24 ; @xmath25+@xmath25 ) resonating group method ( rgm ) approach to the eight - nucleon system .",
    "the trial function of the eight - body system is @xmath26_s \\chi_{[l_1l_2]l}(\\mbox{\\boldmath   $ \\rho $ } _ 1,\\mbox{\\boldmath",

    "in order to project out pure @xmath0li and @xmath0be states , the angular momenta are recoupled in the 7 + 1 channels following the scheme @xmath36j   \\rightarrow \\bigl [ \\bigl [ ( l_1,s_1)i_7 , s_2\\bigr ] i , l_2 \\bigr ] j,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the total spin of the seven nucleon system , and @xmath38 is the channel spin .",
    "the @xmath0li@xmath39)@xmath2be radiative capture cross section is calculated perturbatively @xcite , and is given by @xmath40 where @xmath37 and @xmath41 are the spins of the colliding clusters , @xmath42 denotes the rank of the electromagnetic operator @xmath43 ( @xmath44 or @xmath45 ) , @xmath46 represents the entrance channel , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the total spin of the final and initial state , respectively .",
    "the initial wave function @xmath49 is a partial wave of a unit - flux scattering wave function .",
    "we follow the convention of edmonds @xcite for the reduced matrix elements .",
    "the final @xmath2be ground state is unbound in the @xmath50 channel which , in principle , could cause convergence problems .",
    "however , this is not the case here since the @xmath0li+@xmath16 and @xmath0be+@xmath24 channel wave functions are orthogonal to the @xmath51 one in the asymptotic spatial region .",
    "this feature allows us to treat the @xmath2be ground state as a pseudo - bound state in the @xmath50 configuration .",
    "the orthogonality also indicates that the @xmath0li+@xmath16 @xmath52 @xmath51 contribution to the cross section is small , and that the inclusion of the @xmath53 configurations in the @xmath2be ground state is important .    putting ( [ wf ] ) into the eight - nucleon schrdinger equation which contains the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath54 ) strong and coulomb interactions , we arrive at an equation for the intercluster relative motion functions @xmath55 . for the @xmath56 bound state these functions",

    "the scattering states are calculated from a kohn - hulthn variational method @xcite for the @xmath3-matrix , which uses square integrable basis functions matched with the correct scattering asymptotics .",
    "then , using the resulting eight - nucleon wave functions , the cross section ( [ sigma ] ) is evaluated .",

    "however , we consider only the @xmath0li+@xmath16 and @xmath0be+@xmath24 configurations due to computational constraints .",
    "the results of a full model and a model which contains only @xmath53 configurations are quite similar @xcite , provided the experimental subsystem properties ( separation energies , channel thresholds , sizes , etc . ) are correctly reproduced in each .",

    "these resonance parameters were determined from an analytic continuation of the scattering matrix to complex energies @xcite .",
    "as the @xmath72 state is higher in energy than experimentally observed , and much broader , it does not have any observable effect on the low - energy cross section .",

    "we generate the @xmath56 bound state and @xmath66 , @xmath64 , and @xmath7 scattering states using the same force in all cases . in order to account for specific distortions of @xmath0li and @xmath0be",
    ", we describe these nuclei by using six basis states . the resulting large number ( 5060 ) of coupled channels required special numerical attention to keep high precision in the scattering calculations .",

    "the nonresonant part of the cross section and the first @xmath7 state is well reproduced , although some @xmath4 strength is missing in the resonance region .",
    "note that , as discussed above , inclusion of the @xmath0li+@xmath16 and @xmath0be+@xmath24 configurations in the ground state of @xmath2be is necessary .",
    "the contribution to the cross section from the @xmath76 final state configuration is very small .",
    "this @xmath56 state is thought to be one of the pure two - cluster ( @xmath77 ) systems @xcite .",
    "however , by adding the high - lying @xmath53 channels to the @xmath77 configuration , one gains 12  mev of energy in the @xmath56 state , indicating that this state may not be a pure @xmath77 configuration .    in our model the 386 kev",
    "( @xmath69 ) resonance is dominated by the @xmath78 channel spin .",
    "this is in contradiction to experiment @xcite , which gives 35 for the ratio of the @xmath79 to @xmath78 channel spin contributions to the cross section .",
    "the same @xmath78 dominance was also observed in the calculations of the @xmath7 isobaric analogue state in @xmath2li and @xmath2b . in order to understand the origin of this @xmath78 dominance , we calculated the percentages of the orthogonal @xmath80 components in @xmath2li ( which is the only two - body bound state in the triplet ) .",
    "the @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 components have 83.4% , 0.03% , 13.3% , and 3.2% weights , respectively .",
    "however , the contribution of the largest component , @xmath85 , to the @xmath79 channel spin state is zero , and hence the @xmath78 configuration dominates .",
    "very similar @xmath86 components were found in a different three - body model @xcite using completely different cluster - cluster interactions .",
    "that model would also predict a dominant @xmath78 component in the @xmath87 @xmath5 triplet . in the second @xmath7 ( @xmath72 ) state , our model predicts a dominant @xmath79 component .",
    "it remains a question as to whether the mixing of these states could influence the experimental determination of the channel spin ratio .    as a comparison to the results obtained from our rgm model",
    ", the @xmath88 spectroscopic amplitudes were calculated using wave functions obtained from a large space shell model calculation .",

    "note that the contribution from higher shells to the amplitudes calculated in the @xmath90 space is negligible .",
    "the ck amplitudes favor the @xmath79 channel spin for the @xmath5 state , while the zheng ones support the results of our analysis .",
    "this discrepancy is the result of a slight redistribution of particle strength between the @xmath9 and @xmath101 orbits , as is illustrated in table  [ stheta ] .",
    "the spectroscopic amplitude , @xmath93 , for the capture to the @xmath9 orbit is larger in the zheng model , while there is a corresponding decrease in the magnitude for the capture to the @xmath101 orbit .",
    "it is also interesting to note the signs of the channel - spin amplitudes for the @xmath6 state . in barker s",
    "two - level @xmath8-matrix calculation @xcite , the signs of the reduced widths used were obtained from the shell model .",
    "however , barker changed the sign of the @xmath78 amplitude relative to that of the @xmath79 one , in order to fit the data .",
    "our shell model results does not support this sign change .",
    "we note , that if our channel spin ratio is in fact wrong , then probably the singlet - odd component of the @xmath54 force is responsible for this failure . in our model",
    "we calculate the peak to 80 kev @xmath3 factor ratio for the @xmath78 and @xmath79 channel spin contributions . using these numbers",
    "we can estimate the @xmath4 strength at 80 kev for any given channel spin ratio .",
    "the necessity of the microscopic description of the @xmath0li(@xmath11)@xmath2be ( in contrast to that for @xmath0be(@xmath11)@xmath2b @xcite , for example ) is demonstrated by noting that in a potential model the @xmath79 contribution would come almost exclusively from the internal magnetic moments of @xmath0li and @xmath0be .",
    "the orbital part of the @xmath4 operator describing the relative motion ( which strongly dominates the spin part ) is a rank - zero tensor in spin space .",
    "thus , for any non - vanishing cross section from the @xmath0li@xmath16 relative motion , the initial and final channel spins must be equal .",
    "hence , as the channel spin in the @xmath56 is @xmath78 , the @xmath79 orbital cross section is zero . in our microscopic model ,",
    "the @xmath79 cross section comes mainly from nucleon exchange effects .",
    "the @xmath3 factor is displayed on a linear scale in fig .",
    "[ s_lin ] .",
    "the nonresonant @xmath14 component is in good agreement with the data .",
    "we emphasize that in our model all parameters are fixed .",
    "the requirement that all relevant properties of the subsystems be reproduced does not leave any room for adjustment of parameters .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath4 component to the total @xmath3 factor at 80  kev is 3.5% .",
    "if one adopts a value of 3.2 for the @xmath102 channel spin ratio , together with the experimental width and peak value of the 386  kev resonance , this @xmath4 contribution is 6.3% , consistent with the estimates by barker @xcite .",
    "the value of 20% determined from the tme analysis @xcite may be due to the assumption of a negligible @xmath9 spectroscopic factor .",
    "that assumption is not supported by the results of the shell model calculations presented in table  [ stheta ] .",
    "in summary , we have studied the low - energy @xmath0li(@xmath1)@xmath2be reaction in a microscopic cluster model .",
    "all relevant subsystem properties are well reproduced by our model .",
    "the parameters of the @xmath103 resonance in @xmath2be are in good agreement with the experimental values , while the @xmath104 state is much higher and much broader in energy compared to experiment .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath14 , @xmath63 , and @xmath4 cross sections perturbatively .",
    "the nonresonant @xmath14 component agrees well with the experimental data , while the @xmath63 contribution is negligible .",
    "the calculated full astrophysical @xmath3 factor is in good agreement with the data of zahnow _",
    "@xcite , except that the @xmath6 state does not contribute in our model , and some @xmath4 strength is missing in the @xmath5 resonant region .",
    "this is partly caused by the fact that the width of the @xmath5 state is slightly larger compared to experiment .",
    "our model predicts that in the @xmath87 , @xmath5 triplet the dominant configuration has @xmath78 channel spin .",
    "consequently , the @xmath0li(@xmath1)@xmath2be @xmath4 cross section is also dominated by the @xmath78 component at @xmath67 kev , in contrast with the @xmath79 dominance observed experimentally .",
    "results of large - space shell model calculations , which give a larger spectroscopic factor for the @xmath78 component in the @xmath103 state , seem to support our rgm result , although this depends sensitively on the distribution of strength between the @xmath9 and @xmath101 orbits .",
    "we note , however , that the total @xmath4 cross section can be estimated for any channel spin ratio in our model , using the calculated @xmath78 and @xmath79 @xmath4 components .",
    "the calculated @xmath4 strength at 80 kev is 3.5% in our model .",
    "if we assume the experimental peak height and width of the 386 kev resonance in the @xmath3 factor , and the 3.2 i=2/i=1 channel spin ratio , the model predicts 6.3% , in good agreement the result of an @xmath8 matrix analysis @xcite .",
    "our shell model calculations show that the @xmath9 @xmath0li+@xmath16 spectroscopic factor is larger than the @xmath101 one in the @xmath5 state .",
    "thus the assumption of a vanishing @xmath9 spectroscopic factor in the tme analysis is incorrect .",
