    "[ fig : fig6 ] we study the fluctuation @xmath190 ( in units of @xmath191 ) acting on the first scatterer ( @xmath96 ) in the presence of a second one located in @xmath192 .",
    "the lower curve ( red in color ) is obtained by fixing the model parameters as : @xmath193 , @xmath194 .",
    "it shows peaks associated with the transmission resonances of the two - impurity system as the impurity distance @xmath155 is varied .",
    "the fluctuation peaks determine an increased noise level compared to the value expected for an isolated impurity having the same scattering strength ( i.e. for @xmath195 and @xmath194 ) .",
    "( in units of @xmath191 ) acting on the first scatterer ( @xmath96 ) in the presence of a second one located in @xmath192 . lower curve ( red in color ) is obtained by fixing the model parameters as : @xmath193 , @xmath194 .",
    "upper curve ( blue in color ) is obtained by fixing the model parameters as : @xmath193 , @xmath196 .",
    "the curve in the inset is obtained setting the parameters as : @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 .",
    "parallel lines ( green lines in the main figure and red line in the inset ) indicate the noise level expected for an isolated impurity ( eq .  (",
    "20 ) ) with the same scattering strength @xmath104 of the impurity in @xmath96 at the same temperature .",
    "peaks in the fluctuations are related to the transmission resonances of the two - impurity system . ]",
    "this behavior persists for large separation between the impurities even though the fluctuation peak amplitudes decrease with the distance @xmath155 .",
    "interestingly , the casimir force fluctuations decrease slower than the casimir force expectation value as the scatterer distance is increased .",
    "thus , also in the absence of a net casimir force , casimir force fluctuations can play a relevant role in coupling the dynamics of distant scatterers .",
    "the upper curve ( blue in color ) is obtained by increasing the system temperature ( @xmath200 ) , while setting the scattering strength of the impurities as done for the lower curve .",
    "the higher system temperature amplifies the mean fluctuation level ( and the fluctuation peak amplitudes ) and provides an averaging mechanism which produces a long - distance constant value of the fluctuation .",
    "the long - distance fluctuation value is higher than the noise level of an isolated impurity ( dashed green line ) since the system reflection probability of the single- and two - impurity cases are different",
    ". the single - impurity value ( dashed red line of the inset ) of the fluctuation is recovered at long - distance when the scattering strength of the second impurity is strongly reduced ( @xmath198 ) , as shown in the inset .",
    "+ finally , we conclude that quantum force fluctuations acting on a system impurity can be strongly amplified ( compared to the isolated impurity case ) in the presence of a second impurity .",
    "this implies that the mechanical actions affecting impurities immersed in a coherent quantum fluid are correlated via a casimir - like mechanism which can play a relevant role in low - dimensional systems .",
    "we have formulated a scattering field theory accounting for the mechanical actions experienced by impurities located in a coherent fermionic fluid .",
    "the theory allows the study of equilibrium and out - of - equilibrium situations taking into account the impurity - fluid interaction at a non - perturbative level . using the theory , we studied the single - impurity and the two - impurity cases .",
    "as for the single - scatterer case , we find that a net force affects the scatterer dynamics only in the presence of a non - vanishing particle current flowing through the system ( non - equilibrium ) , while force fluctuations are not negligible both in equilibrium and in non - equilibrium conditions . concerning the two - scatterer case , an attractive fluid - mediated casimir force is experienced by the scatterers at small spatial separation , while a decaying attractive / repulsive behavior as a function of the scatterer distance is found .",
    "we also find a casimir - like force experienced by an impurity in close vicinity of the boundary of the system .",
    "for the one dimensional system studied in this work , the casimir force decays as the inverse of the impurity distance and thus represents a long - range interaction which can be easily measured , for instance , in cold atoms systems .",
    "when detrimental effects of decoherence are included in the model , the casimir interaction is progressively reduced as the system coherence length @xmath177 is decreased .",
    "we also studied the casimir force fluctuations , measured by @xmath190 , acting on a given scatterer in close vicinity of an other one .",
    "we show that the @xmath190 _ vs _ @xmath138 curves present an oscillating behavior reaching a long - distance limit which is comparable with the value of the single - scatterer case .",
    "depending on the impurity separation , at short distance , force fluctuations can became either stronger or weaker than the force variance experienced by an isolated impurity .",
    "our findings demonstrate that force fluctuations acting on close impurities immersed in a coherent fluid are correlated by casimir - like interactions which are reminiscent of friedel density oscillations and resonant scattering through the double - impurity system .",
    "antonio stabile is acknowledged for inspiring discussions about casimir effect . discussions with roberta citro , antonio di bartolomeo , filippo giubileo , carlo barone and sergio pagano are also acknowledged .",
    "using the schrdinger - like equation for the field @xmath0 with the single - particle potential @xmath201 the following boundary conditions on @xmath0 can be found : @xmath202 the field @xmath0 on the left ( @xmath203 ) and on the right ( @xmath204 ) of the scatterer can be decomposed in incoming ( @xmath205 ) and outgoing ( @xmath206 ) scattering operators according to the following expansion : @xmath207 substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : wfsapp ] ) into eq .  ( [ eq : bcsapp ] ) one can find a relation between the scattering operators @xmath43 and @xmath208 .",

    "the quantum statistical average of two scattering operators is given by @xmath52 .",
    "quantum averages involving four scattering operators can be evaluated using wick s theorem obtaining the following result : @xmath219\\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in deriving the above relation we used the anticommutation relation @xmath220 .",
    "the matrix @xmath117 defining the relation between the inner mode operators @xmath114 and @xmath115 on @xmath43 can be written in terms of the transfer matrix @xmath221 of the impurity located in @xmath96 and of the scattering matrix elements @xmath50 of the whole system according to the relation : @xmath222 the derivation of the above result exploits the following relations linking the scattering fields : @xmath223    @xmath224    @xmath225    where @xmath226 represents the transfer matrix of the two - impurity system written in terms of the transfer matrices of the first and second impurity .",
    "the matrix @xmath117 can be also derived in terms of @xmath227 according to the expression : @xmath228 the latter formula providing the same result of equation  ( [ eq : m - matrix ] ) .",
    "dephasing effects ( decoherence ) can be studied by introducing random phases within the scattering region @xcite .",
    "in particular we consider the scattering matrix @xmath229 describing a pure ( reflectionless ) dephasing process : @xmath230 where @xmath171 represents a random gaussian variable ( with probability density distribution @xmath231 ) having zero expectation value , @xmath232 , and finite variance @xmath233 , the latter quantity being related with the decoherence .",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath229 determines the relations @xmath234 and @xmath235 such that the t - matrix of a pure dephasing process can be written as : @xmath236 let us study a sequence of @xmath237 scatterers located at @xmath238 and characterized by a collection of t - matrices whose generic element @xmath239 describes the scattering properties of the _",
