    "to provide physical meaning to solutions of einstein equations , is an endeavour whose relevance deserves to be emphasized @xcite .",
    "this is particularly true in the case of the levi - civita ( lc ) spacetime @xcite which after many years and a long list of works dedicated to its discussion still presents serious challenges to its interpretation ( @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "this metric has two essential constants , usually denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",
    "one of them , @xmath4 has to do with the topology of spacetime and , more specifically , refers to the deficit angle .",
    "it may accordingly be related to the gravitational analog of aharonov bohmm effect @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is however @xmath0 , the parameter which presents the most serious obstacles to its interpretation .    indeed , for small @xmath0 @xmath5 lc describes the spacetime generated by an infinite line mass , with mass @xmath0 per unit coordinate length .",
    "when @xmath6 the spacetime is flat @xcite .",
    "however , circular timelike geodesics exits only for @xmath7 becoming null when @xmath8 and being spacelike for @xmath9    furthermore , as the value of @xmath0 increases from @xmath10 to @xmath11 the corresponding kretschmann scalar diminishes monotonically , vanishing at @xmath12 , and implying thereby that the space is flat also when @xmath13    still worse , if @xmath14 the spacetime admits an extra killing vector which corresponds to plane symmetry @xcite ( also present of course in the @xmath12 case ) .",
    "thus , the obvious question is : what does lc represents for values of @xmath15 outside the range ( 0,@xmath10 ) ?",
    "the absence of circular test particle orbits for @xmath16 , and the fact that most of the known material sources for lc , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite require @xmath17 , led to think that lc describes the field of a cylinder only if @xmath0 ranges within the ( 0,@xmath10 ) interval .",
    "however , interior solutions matching to lc exist,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite with @xmath16 .    furthermore , the absence of circular test particle orbits for @xmath16 may simply be interpreted , as due to the fact that the centrifugal force required to balance the gravitational attraction implies velocities of the test particle larger than 1 ( speed of light ) @xcite .",
    "this last argument in turn , was objected in the past on the basis that kretschmann scalar decreases as @xmath0 increases from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , suggesting thereby that the gravitational field becomes weaker @xcite , @xcite . however , as it has been recently emphasized @xcite , @xcite , kretschmann scalar may not be a good measure of the strength of the gravitational field . instead , those authors suggest that the acceleration of the test particle represents more suitably the intensity of the field .",
    "parenthetically , this acceleration increases with @xmath0 in the interval ( @xmath10,@xmath11 ) .",
    "on the basis of the arguments above and from the study of a specific interior solution matched to lc @xcite , bonnor @xcite proposes to interpret lc as the spacetime generated by a cylinder whose radius increases with @xmath0 , and tends to infinity as @xmath0 approaches @xmath11 .",
    "this last fact suggests that when @xmath1 , the cylinder becomes a plane .",
    "this interpretation of the @xmath1 case was already put forward by gautreau and hoffman in @xcite ( observe that theirs @xmath0 is twice ours ) , though based on different considerations .",
    "however , in our opinion , the question is not yet solved .    indeed , the interior solution analyzed in @xcite is not valid when @xmath12 .",
    "therefore the vanishing of the normal curvatures of the coordinate lines on the bounding surface when @xmath18 , suggests but does not prove that the exterior solution with @xmath1 has a plane source .",
    "the lc spacetime has no horizons . according to our present knowledge of the formation of black holes",
    ", this seems to indicate that there is an upper limit to the mass per unit length of the line sources , and this limit has to be below the critical linear mass , above which horizons are expected to be formed @xcite .",
    "the anisotropic fluid @xcite with @xmath19 matched to lc , produces an effective mass per unit length that has maximum at @xmath20which might explain the inexistence of horizons . furthermore , this fact might support too the previous acceleration representation of the field intensity .",
    "it agrees with the result that the tangential speed @xmath21 of a test particle @xcite in a circular geodesics increases with @xmath0 , attaining @xmath22 for @xmath23 the source studied in @xcite remains cylindrical for @xmath20 producing a cosmic string with finite radius .",
    "however , the effective mass density by increasing up to @xmath24 and then decreasing for bigger values of @xmath0 , raises a disturbing situation of a cylindrical distribution mass not curving spacetime exactly at its maximum value .",
    "on the other hand , there exists a puzzling asymmetry between the negative and the positive mass case , for the plane source .",
    "the point is that , as mentioned before , the @xmath14 case posseses plane symmetry and furthermore test particles are repelled by the singularity . therefore lc with @xmath14 , has been interpreted as the gravitational field produced by an infinite sheet of negative mass density @xcite ( though there are discrepancies on this point @xcite ) .",
    "however in this case ( @xmath14 ) the space is not flat , unlike the @xmath1 case .",
    "in other words , if we accept both interpretations , i.e. @xmath1 @xmath25 represents the field produced by an infinite plane with positive ( negative ) mass density , then we have to cope with the strange fact that the negative mass plane curves the spacetime , whereas the positive mass plane does not .",
    "this asymmetry is , intuitively , difficult to understand .    in favor of the plane interpretation for the @xmath1 case , point the arguments presented in @xcite , although as already mentioned , they are not conclusive .    furthermore , even if we admit the arguments based on the principle of equivalence , leading to the plane interpretation of the @xmath1 case , there is a problem with the localization of the source itself ( the plane ) .",
    "indeed , it seems reasonable to assume , according to the equivalence principle , that the physical components of curvature tensor of an homogeneous static field , vanish everywhere , except on the source ( the plane ) , where they should be singular .",
    "however , when @xmath1 the space is flat everywhere ( everywhere meaning the region covered by the patch of coordinates under consideration ) , and therefore a pertinent question is : where is the source ?    in the @xmath14 case , the plane interpretation is supported by the plane symmetry of the spacetime , although objections to this interpretation have been raised , on the basis that the proper distance between neighbouring paths of test particles changes with time @xcite .",
    "however , see a comment on this point , below eq.(10 ) .    also , in this case , the physical components of the curvature tensor , and the cartan scalars , are singular at @xmath26 , revealing the existence of a source , however they do not vanish ( except in the limit @xmath27 ) and therefore the pertinent question here is : why does the arguments based on the equivalence principle , mentioned above , do not apply , if @xmath28 corresponds to a plane ?",
    "so , unless additional arguments are presented , we are inclined to think that either of the interpretations ( or both ) are wrong .    in order to delve deeper into these questions , and with the purpose of bringing forward new arguments",
    ", we propose here to analyze some gedanken experiments with a gyroscope circumventing the axis of symmetry .",
    "the obtained expression for the total precession per revolution , @xmath29 , will depend on @xmath0 . then , analyzying the behaviour of @xmath29 as function of different physical variables we shall be able to provide additional elements for the interpretation of lc .    in relation to this , we shall consider also the c - metric ( see@xcite-@xcite and references therein ) , which , as it is well known , describes , in the limit of vanishing mass parameter , the flat space as seen by an accelerated observer ( as the @xmath1 case ) .    as it will be seen below",
    ", the discussion presented here does not lead to conclusive answers to the raised issues , but provides hints reinforcing some already given interpretations and , in some cases , creating doubts abouts formerly accepted points of view .",
    "in particular it appears that the interpretation of the coordinate @xmath2 as an angle coordinate seems to be untenable in some cases . a fact already brought out in @xcite .    at any rate ,",
    "it is our hope that the results and arguments here presented , will stimulate further discussions on this interesting problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the lc spacetime and the c - metric . in section 3",
    "we give the expression for the total precession per revolution of a gyroscope circumventing the axis of symmetry and display figures indicating its dependence upon different variables .",
    "finally , results are discussed in the last section .",
    "we shall first describe the lc line element , together with the notation and conventions used here .",
    "next we shall briefly describe the c - metric .",
    "the lc metric can be written as @xcite , @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath3 and @xmath0 are constants .",
    "the coordinates are numbered @xmath31 and their range are @xmath32 with the hypersurface @xmath33 and @xmath34 being identified .    as stressed in @xcite",
    "neither @xmath3 nor @xmath0 can be removed by coordinate transformations , and therefore they have to be considered as essential parameters of the lc metric .    as mentioned before , @xmath3 has to do with the topology of spacetime , giving rise to an angular deficit @xmath35 equal to @xcite @xmath36    also , as commented in the introduction , the spacetime becomes flat if @xmath37 is @xmath38 or @xmath11 .",
    "in the first case , @xmath39 the line element ( 2 ) , adopts the usual form of the minkoswski interval in cylindrical coordinates ( except for the presence of @xmath3 )    in the second case , @xmath1 , the line element becomes @xmath40 this last expression corresponding to the flat spacetime described by an uniformly accelerated observer with a topological defect associated to @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , putting @xmath41 for simplificity , the transformation @xmath42 casts ( 6 ) into @xmath43    then , the components of the four - acceleration of a particle at rest in the frame of ( 6 ) ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 @xmath46 ) as measured by an observer at rest in the minkowski frame of ( 8) are    @xmath47    and therefore @xmath48    thereby indicating that such a particle is accelerated , with proper acceleration @xmath49 .",
    "it is perhaps worth noticing that due to ( 4 ) and ( 7 ) , the range of the minkowski coordinate @xmath50 is rather unusual .",
    "also observe that bodies located at different points , undergo different accelerations .",
    "this implies in turn that two bodies undergoing the same proper acceleration do not maintain the same proper distance ( see p.176 in @xcite for details ) .",
    "this metric was discovered by levi - civita @xcite , and rediscovered since then by many authors ( see a detailed account in @xcite ) .",
    "it may be written in the form @xmath51 with @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the two constant parameters of the solution .",
    "introducing retarded coordinates @xmath55 and @xmath56 , defined by @xmath57 @xmath58 the metric takes the form @xmath59 with @xmath60    if @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , the c - metric becomes schwarzschild .",
    "but , if @xmath63 and @xmath64 then ( 15 ) may be written , with @xmath65 @xmath66 as @xmath67 @xmath68 which can be casted into the minkowski line element by @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72    now , for a particle at rest in the ( @xmath73 ) frame ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 @xmath46 ) the components of the four - acceleration as measured by an observer at rest in the ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath50 , @xmath78 ) frame , are @xmath79 @xmath80    then , the absolute value of the four acceleration vector for such particle is @xmath81 indicating that the locus @xmath82 is accelerated with constant proper acceleration @xmath54 .",
    "observe that in this case the ( @xmath73 ) coordinates are only restricted by @xmath83",
    "let us consider a gyroscope circumventing the symmetry axis along a circular path ( not a geodesic ) , with angular velocity @xmath84",
    ". then it can be shown that the total precession per revolution is given by ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "the tangential velocity of particles along circular trayectories ( not necessarily geodesics ) on the plane ortogonal to the symmetry axis , is given by the modulos of the four - vector ( see @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) @xmath87 ^{-1}v^\\mu ,   \\label{25}\\ ] ] with @xmath88    then , for a particle in lc spacetime @xmath89 in terms of @xmath21 , the expression for @xmath90 becomes @xmath91 .",
    "\\label{28}\\ ] ]      next , due to the similarity of interpretation , mentioned before , between the @xmath1 case and the c - metric with @xmath63 , we shall also calculate the total precession per revolution of a gyroscope circumventing the axis of symmetry , in the space - time of the c - metric .    using the rindler - perlick method @xcite , and writing the c - metric in the form @xcite",
    "@xmath92 @xmath93 with @xmath94 @xmath95 and @xmath96 one obtains , @xmath97 @xmath98 with @xmath99    if @xmath100 we recover the usual thomas precession in a minkowski spacetime .",
    "if @xmath63 and @xmath64 on the @xmath101 plane , @xmath102 ^{-1/2}\\right\\ }   \\label{33}\\ ] ] which is the thomas precession modified by the acceleration factor @xmath54 ; while if @xmath62 , @xmath61 , we recover the usual fokker - de sitter expression for precession of a gyroscope in the schwarzschild metric @xcite , @xmath103    in the general case @xmath62 , @xmath104 ( on the @xmath101 plane ) , we have from ( 31 ) that , either @xmath105 or @xmath106 . in the first case ( @xmath105 ) we obtain @xmath107 ^{-1/2}\\right\\ }   \\label{35}\\ ] ] whereas in the case @xmath106 , the result is @xmath108 @xmath109 ^{-1/2}\\right\\ }   \\label{36}\\ ] ]    however , this last case implies @xmath110 , for otherwise @xmath111 , what would change the signature of the metric .    finally , the tangential velocity of the gyroscope on the circular orbit calculated from ( 23 ) for the c - metric yields @xmath112    then replacing @xmath84 by @xmath21 with ( 37 ) , into ( 35 ) , we obtain ( @xmath113 ) @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 where @xmath117 in the last case however , remember that @xmath53 must be negative .    if @xmath63 , ( 32 ) may be written ( with ( 37 ) ) as @xmath118 with @xmath119 indicating that the precession is retrograde for any @xmath120 and @xmath121    in the next section we shall discuss about the meaning of lc in the light of the information provided by ( 28 ) and ( 38 ) .",
    "let us now analyze some figures obtained from ( 28 ) and ( 38 ) .      for @xmath124 ( @xmath16 )",
    "the precession is always forward ( @xmath125 ) as it obvious from ( 28 ) .",
    "however for @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) it may be retrograde ( @xmath128 ) depending on @xmath129 and @xmath21 , as indicated in figure(2 ) , figure(3 ) .",
    "thus the cases @xmath130 ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath131 ( @xmath14 ) induce very different behaviours on gyroscopes .",
    "this fact , together with the assymmetry mentioned in the introduction , reinforces our doubts about the simultaneous interpretation of both cases ( @xmath132 ) as due to infinite sheet of either positive or negative mass density .",
    "next , let us consider the c - metric in the @xmath63 case .",
    "figure(4 ) shows the behaviour of the gyroscope as function of the acceleration .",
    "observe that the precession is retrograde , in contrast with the @xmath130 case , for which @xmath133 is always positive .",
    "this behaviour is the opposite for lc and @xmath134 equal to @xmath135 ( see fig.(5 ) ) , and reinforces further the difficulty of interpreting @xmath2 ( in lc with @xmath130 ) as the usual azhimutal angle .",
    "still worse , in this later case , @xmath90 always exceed @xmath136 indicating that the precession is forward even in the rotating frame .    now , since both cases ( c - metric with @xmath63 and lc with @xmath130 ) represent the same physical situation ( i.e. flat space described by an uniformly accelerated observer ) then we have to conclude that the meaning of @xmath2 in lc with @xmath130 , is different from its usual interpretation ( as an angle ) .",
    "this also becomes apparent from the definition of @xmath21 given by ( 27 ) ( the tangential velocity decreases as @xmath137 ) .",
    "also observe that in the case of the c - metric with @xmath63 , we recover the thomas precession in the limit @xmath138 .",
    "this however is impossible in the lc case with @xmath130 . in the same order of ideas",
    "it is worth noticing that in the case @xmath131 , the meaning of @xmath2 seems to correspond ( qualitatively ) to that of an azimuthal angle .    on the other hand",
    ", it is clear that in the case of a plane source we should not expect @xmath2 to behave like an angle coordinate ( see also @xcite on this point ) .",
    "therefore , on the basis of all comments above , we are inclined to think ( as in @xcite ) that the @xmath139 @xmath11 case corresponds to an infinite plane . the absence of singularities in the physical components of the curvature tensor , remaining unexplained , although ( probably ) related to the restrictions on the covering , of the coordinate system . by the same arguments it should be clear that the interpretation of the @xmath131 case as due to a plane , seems to be questionable ."
