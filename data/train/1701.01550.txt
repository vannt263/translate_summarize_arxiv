    "in recent years , multicarrier code - division multiple - access ( mc - cdma ) based on the quasi-/perfect- complementary sequence set ( in abbreviation , qcss / pcss ) has attracted much attention due to its potential to achieve low-/zero- interference multiuser performance @xcite , @xcite . here",
    ", a qcss ( or pcss ) refers to a set of two - dimensional matrices with low ( or zero ) non - trivial auto- and cross- correlation sums @xcite@xmath7@xcite . in this paper , a complementary sequence",
    "is also called a complementary matrix , and vice versa .    to deploy a qcss ( or pcss ) in an mc - cdma system , every data symbol of a specific user",
    "is spread by a complementary matrix by simultaneously sending out all of its row sequences over a number of non - interfering subcarrier channels .",
    "because of this , the number of row sequences of a complementary matrix , denoted by @xmath2 , is also called the _ number of channels_. at a matched - filter based receiver , de - spreading operations are performed separately in each subcarrier channel , followed by summing the correlator outputs of all the subcarrier channels to attain a correlation sum which will be used for detection .",
    "a pcss may also be called a mutually orthogonal complementary sequence set ( mocss ) @xcite@xmath7@xcite , a concept extended from mutually orthogonal golay complementary pairs ( gcps ) @xcite@xmath7@xcite . however , a drawback of pcss is its small set size @xcite . specifically , the set size ( denoted by @xmath1 ) of pcss is upper bounded by the number of channels , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "this means that a pcss based mc - cdma system with @xmath2 subcarriers can support at most @xmath2 users only .",
    "against such a backdrop , there have been two approaches aiming to provide a larger set size , i.e. , @xmath9 .",
    "the first approach is to design zero- or low- correlation zone ( zcz / lcz ) based complementary sequence sets , called zcz - css @xcite , @xcite or lcz - css @xcite .",
    "a zcz - css ( lcz - css ) based mc - cdma system is capable of achieving zero- ( low- ) interference performance but requires a closed - control loop to dynamically adjust the timings of all users such that the received signals can be quasi - synchronously aligned within the zcz ( lcz ) .",
    "a second approach is to design qcss which has uniformly low correlation sums over all non - trivial time - shifts . as such",
    ", qcss can be utilized to achieve low - interference performance with a simpler timing - control system . to the authors best knowledge , the first aperiodic correlation lower bound of qcss",
    "was derived by welch in @xcite , which states : @xmath10 where every quasi - complementary sequence is a matrix of order @xmath11 ( thus , every row sequence has length of @xmath3 ) with assumed energy of @xmath12 .",
    "the aforementioned set size upper bound of pcss , namely , @xmath8 , can also be obtained from ( [ welch_bound_for_cc ] ) by setting @xmath13 . on the other hand , if @xmath14 , one can show that @xmath9 , meaning that a larger set size can be supported by qcss .",
    "recently , a generalized levenshtein bound ( glb ) for qcss has been derived by liu , guan and mow in [ [ liuguanmow14 ] , _ theorem 1 _ ] .",
    "the key idea behind the glb ( including the levenshtein bound @xcite ) is that the weighted mean square aperiodic correlation of any sequence subset over the complex roots of unity should be equal to or greater than that of the whole set which includes all possible complex roots - of - unity sequences .",
    "the levenshtein bound was extended from binary sequences to complex roots - of - unity sequences by bozta @xcite .",
    "a lower bound for aperiodic lcz sequence sets was derived in @xcite by an approach similar to levenshtein s .    in its bounding equation ,",
    "glb is a function of the  simplex \" weight vector @xmath0 , the set size @xmath1 , the number of channels @xmath2 , and the row sequence length @xmath3 .",
    "a necessary condition ( shown in [ [ liuguanmow14 ] , _ theorem 2 _ ] ) for the glb to be tighter than the welch bound is that @xmath5 , where @xmath15 with @xmath16 although a  step - function \" weight vector was adopted in [ [ liuguanmow14 ] , ( 34 ) ] , it only leads to a tighter glb for @xmath17 . as a matter of fact",
    ", the tightness of glb remains unknown for @xmath18 when @xmath3 is sufficiently large .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to optimize and then tighten the glb for _ all _ @xmath5 ( instead of _ some _ ) . for this",
    ", we are to find a ( locally ) optimal weight vector which is used in the bounding equation .",
    "a similar research problem was raised in @xcite for traditional binary sequences ( i.e. , non - qcss with @xmath19 ) .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "the optimization of glb on qcss ( with @xmath4 ) , however , is more challenging because an analytical solution to a non - convex glb ( in terms of weight vector @xmath0 ) for _ all _ possible cases of @xmath20 is in general intractable .",
    "we first adopt a frequency - domain optimization approach in section iii - b to minimize the ( non - convex ) fractional quadratic function of glb .",
    "this is achieved by properly exploiting the specific structure of the circulant quadratic matrix in the numerator of the fractional quadratic term of glb . following this optimization approach",
    ", we find a new weight vector which leads to a tighter glb for _ all _ @xmath20 cases satisfying @xmath5 and @xmath4 , asymptotically ( in @xmath3 ) .",
    "our finding shows that the condition of @xmath5 , shown in [ [ liuguanmow14 ] , theorem 2 ] , is not only necessary but also sufficient , as @xmath3 tends to infinity .",
    "moreover , in section iii - c , it is proved that the newly found weight vector is a local minimizer to the fractional quadratic function of glb , asymptotically .",
    "we then examine in sections iv two weight vectors which were presented in @xcite for the tightening of the levenshtein bound on conventional single - channel ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) sequence sets .",
    "we extend their tightening capability to glb on multi - channel ( i.e. , @xmath4 ) qcss , although the proof is not straightforward .",
    "it is shown that each of these two weight vectors gives rise to a tighter glb ( over the welch bound ) for several small values of @xmath2 provided that @xmath5 .",
    "it is also noted that the glb from the newly found weight vector is ( in general ) tighter than the glbs from these two ( earlier found ) weight vectors , as shown by some numerical results .",
    "in this section , we first present some necessary notations and define qcss . then",
    ", we give a brief review of glb .",
