    "the concept of disorder - induced localization of electrons was first proposed by p.  w.  anderson  @xcite .",
    "an electron scattered by a disordered potential interferes with itself and consequently localizes in space .",
    "in this situation , temperature and magnetic field dependence of the conductance and critical exponents near metal - insulator transitions are universal : independent of the kind of material  @xcite .",
    "they depend only on the dimensions and internal symmetries of single - particle hamiltonians describing the systems .",
    "the internal symmetries are time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) and spin - rotational symmetry ( srs )  @xcite .",
    "for instance , quantum hall state is a good example of an anderson localization state with the breaking of trs ( classified in unitary class ) .",
    "furthermore , the field of study of anderson localization also involves that of topological insulators  @xcite .",
    "the classification of topological insulators in @xmath12 dimensions is constructed by studying the localization problem in a @xmath13-dimensional ( surface of @xmath12 dimensional systems ) disordered system . identifying the universality class",
    "is regarded as an important problem of modern condensed matter physics .",
    "the scaling theory of anderson localization predicts that all electrons in a disordered potential are localized in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems when both trs and srs of the hamiltonians are preserved  @xcite .",
    "however , when a homogeneous magnetic field is applied , electrons are extended , not localized due to broken trs .",
    "in this situation , the hamiltonians are classified as unitary class .",
    "it is a stimulating question whether electrons localize or not in which trs is locally and randomly broken by a random magnetic field ( rmf ) .",
    "an rmf means that localized magnetic moments take random positions in space .",
    "the universality class of this system is non - trivial since trs is _ locally _ broken but _ globally _ not .",
    "it has been suggested that the quantum states in rmf systems are relevant to the physics of strongly correlated electron systems such as fractional quantum hall systems  @xcite or high @xmath14 superconductors  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the conduction of electrons in an rmf has been studied only by theoretical methods  @xcite .",
    "our purpose is to clarify the conduction of electrons in rmf systems experimentally .    in this letter , we measured the resistance of single crystals with 2d electronic systems with an rmf and considered the universality class of their systems .",
    "we formed an rmf in @xmath0-tase@xmath1 crystals by doping magnetic impurities .",
    "the paramagnetism possessed by @xmath0-fe@xmath2tase@xmath1 crystals indicates that the magnetic moments are random in space , and so the crystals are ideal rmf systems .",

    "the resistance of insulator single crystals became almost independent of temperature below @xmath15",
    "k. this behavior is consistent with the unitary class of anderson localization .",
