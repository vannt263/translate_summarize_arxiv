    "although the m theory seems to be occupying one corner of the moduli space of all the string theories  @xcite , it still lacks a formulation which is as intuitively comprehensible as the other string theories .",
    "typeiib theory is known to have both the string and the matrix formulations  @xcite and the m theory has so far only the matrix formulation  @xcite .",
    "the latter is known to have some connection to the membrane theory  @xcite but its legitimacy as the fundamental theory is in doubt  @xcite .",
    "whether the theory is fundamental or just effective it may happen that the vacuum amplitude is dominated by the process of all possible closed membranes being created and annihilated .",
    "if it is true , then , the scattering amplitude of closed membranes can be calculated just by inserting some vertex operators before the path integration is performed for the vacuum amplitude .    to locate a vertex operator in some finite position in the euclidean space ,",
    "the conformal invariance was essential in the case of string theory .",
    "we implicitly assume that the same should be true also in the case of membrane theory , although the essential part of our discussions does not depend on the form of the action . in the case of closed string ( fig .  1  ( a ) ) , the vacuum amplitude is obtained by summing all the amplitudes corresponding to fig .  1  ( b ) , namely all the amplitudes for the closed two - dimensional surfaces . in the case of closed membrane theory",
    "we must consider the processes which involve all types of closed surfaces shown in fig .  1  ( b ) .",
    "these surfaces should be created and annihilated in the vacuum process .",
    "the surfaces with a higher genus may be regarded as a bound state of lower genus surfaces but instead we treat them on an equal footing in the approach described here . the process of creation and the subsequent propagation , or the splitting etc .  and",
    "finally the annihilation of a closed string is described by an amplitude on a closed surface .",
    "this should be extended also to the case of closed surface .",
    "this means that the vacuum amplitude of the closed membrane theory must be the sum of amplitudes of all possible three - dimensional closed manifolds .",
    "it is well known that the torii with genus number @xmath1 exhaust all possible two - dimensional connected orientable surfaces .",
    "the three - dimensional case is more complicated .",
    "here we rely on the fact that any closed , orientable three - dimensional manifold has at least one heegaard diagram ( or heegaard splitting ) : let @xmath2 and @xmath3 be solid torii of the same genus @xmath4,and let @xmath5 be a homeomorphism .",
    "then any closed connected orientable three - dimensional manifold @xmath6 can be identified with @xmath7 ;    @xmath8 .",
    "there is no uniqueness of the diagram as is shown in fig.2 where @xmath0 is shown to have a heegaard diagram ( @xmath9 ) with @xmath2 and @xmath3 of any number of genus @xmath4 .",
    "this causes some interesting complications which can be solved if the poincar conjecture is valid for the three - dimensional manifolds as will be explained in the subsequent sections .",
    "the application of membrane theory to physics may not come from the fundamental theory ( even if it exists ) but rather from the solitonic membrane .",
    "the process of membranes appearing and disappearing in the euclidean time is nothing but the membrane instanton  @xcite . in some models , this is the only source of four - dimensional superpotential and , thus , this may be the reason for the smallness of masses of quarks and leptons  @xcite .",
    "the issue will be briefly discussed in the subsequent sections although , admittedly , a lot will remain in the future investigation .",
    "section 2 will be devoted to the general discussions and mathematical preliminaries .",
    "section 3 will deal with the case of @xmath10 which corresponds to the lens spaces .",
    "section 4 treats the case of @xmath11 and higher .",
    "section 5 contains summary and discussions .",
    "much of our discussions are independent of the action we adopt for the membrane .",
    "still , the concrete results seem to depend on it rather crucially because of the geometrical nature of our results .",
    "let us start from the following expression for the generic vacuum amplitude : @xmath12 where @xmath13 stands for all possible closed connected orientable three manifolds , and the action @xmath14 is of the form : @xmath15 with an appropriate membrane lagrangian @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 stands for the generic field which comes into the lagrangian @xmath16 .",
    "we can adopt as @xmath16 the super symmetric lagrangian given in ref .",
    "@xcite or , for simplicity , the following weyl invariant bosonic membrane lagrangian as an effective lagrangian , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the membrane tension , @xmath20 is the metric tensor , @xmath21 is the membrane coordinate in the @xmath22-dimensional target space and @xmath23 is the compensating field .",
    "both the target space and the world volume space are taken to be euclidean . whether the lagrangian ( [ eq : lgrgnmmbrn ] ) or its supersymmetric extension can be free of weyl anomaly for certain value of @xmath22 is itself an interesting problem but we will not touch on this issue here .",
    "our main concern in this work is the sum over @xmath13 .",
    "as is explained in the introduction each @xmath13 has at least one heegaard diagram @xmath24 . the fig .",
    "3  ( a ) illustrates the case of @xmath10 and the fig .  3  ( b ) corresponds to the case of @xmath11 .",
    "each case can be transformed to a more physically intuitive fig .",
    "4  ( a ) and fig .  4  ( b ) , respectively . in fig .  4  ( a )",
    ", a thin torus surface is created at the euclidean time @xmath25 and propagates within @xmath2 until @xmath26 . at @xmath26 ,",
    "all sorts of @xmath27 transform the torus surface into @xmath3 .",
    "the surface propagates within @xmath3 until it disappears at @xmath28 .",
    "similar interpretation can be given to fig .",
    "4  ( b ) with @xmath11 torus .",
    "the @xmath29 case is omitted here as the simplest exercise for the reader .",
    "the whole problem , therefore , comes down to the issue of classification of @xmath27 in each genus case .",
    "this , of course , is basically solved in the well established theorem due to lickorish  @xcite which states that any @xmath27 for genus @xmath4 heegaard diagram is isotopic to the composition of the dehn twists along @xmath30 closed curves .",
    "the curves for @xmath10 and @xmath11 cases are already given in fig .",
    "3  ( a ) and fig .  3  ( b ) as @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively and the general case in fig .  5 .",
    "although much is known for this problem  @xcite , it still looks formidable to perform the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vcmamp ] ) for all possible @xmath27 .",
    "fortunately , there seem to be ways out as will be explained in the following sections for each value of @xmath4 .",
    "the method is different in each case of @xmath4 so that the discussion will be left to the sections which deal with individual cases .    in each case",
    "we can not perform the integration for @xmath33 .",
    "we concentrate on the topological aspect and we pick a particular value for @xmath33 and try to perturb @xmath33 around this value . instanton case is slightly different in that it is independent to @xmath33 from the beginning and we must consider effectively the following case  @xcite , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a certain three form defined on @xmath36 which is a three - dimensional manifold in a certain seven - dimensional compact space in case of m theory .",
    "@xmath35 can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a component of a basis of three forms and @xmath39 is the third betti number of @xmath36 .",
    "these can be calculated in principle for a given heegaard diagram @xmath24 .",
    "we touch on this case in the following separate sections for @xmath10 and for @xmath40 .    in the process of adding the contributions from @xmath41 we encounter the problem of double counting due to the non - uniqueness of the heegaard diagram",
    "although it is meaningless until we know exactly how to determine the coefficient in front of each contribution . in principle , this can be solved assuming the validity of the poincar conjecture which states that the homology group together with the fundamental group classifies the topology of the manifolds .",
    "fox example , @xmath29 is @xmath0 and we know out of @xmath10 heegaard diagrams there exists only one with the trivial fundamental group .",
    "we , therefore , subtract this contribution from the @xmath10 contribution .",
    "this kind of renormalization or subtraction procedure can in principle be applied to higher genus cases although poincar conjecture in three dimensional case is yet to be proven beyond @xmath42 .",
    "the heegaard diagram @xmath24 for @xmath10 is well understood .",
    "each @xmath27 corresponds to the following @xmath43 operation @xmath44 here @xmath45 or @xmath46 corresponds to the @xmath47-th meridian or to the @xmath48-th longitude respectively .",
