    "since the introduction by slutsky @xcite , moving average models have played a significant role in time series analysis , especially in finance and economics .",
    "the models have been extended to include measurable ( nonlinear ) functions of independent and identically distributed random variables , representing unobservable and purely random impulses , for example , robinson @xcite .",
    "the characterizing feature of these models is the cut - off of the auto - covariance functions when they exist , implying that they are models of short memory .",
    "another interesting feature of these models is the homogeneity of the random impulses , free from any feedback in the generating mechanism .",
    "now , slutsky developed these models in an economic context ; the random impulses may correspond to unobservable political factors .",
    "in such a context , as well as in other contexts for which these models are relevant ( e.g. , business studies ) , it can be argued that feedback is often present : political decisions are often predicated on economic conditions .",
    "one simple way to incorporate feedback in these models is through the notion of thresholds , that is , on - off feedback controllers .",
    "since tong @xcite initiated the threshold notion in time series modelling , the notion has been extensively used in the literature , especially for the threshold autoregressive ( tar ) or tar - type models . for these models ,",
    "some basic and probabilistic properties were given in chan _",
    "_ @xcite and chan and tong @xcite .",
    "more related results can be found in an and huang @xcite , brockwell _ et al . _",

    "@xcite , liu and susko @xcite and lu @xcite , among others .",
    "a fairly comprehensive review of threshold models is available in tong @xcite and a selective survey of the history of threshold models is given by tong @xcite .",
    "however , most work to - date on the threshold model has primarily concentrated on the tar or the tar - type model .",
    "the threshold moving average ( tma ) model , that is a moving average model with a simple on - off feedback control mechanism , has not attracted as much attention . as far as we know ,",
    "only a few results are available for the tma model .",
    "@xcite investigated a threshold autoregressive and moving - average ( tarma ) model and obtained a  strictly stationary and ergodic solution to the model when the ma part does not contain any threshold component .",
    "unfortunately , their tarma model does not cover the tma model as a special case . using the markov chain theory , liu and",
    "susko @xcite provided the existence of the strictly stationary solution to the tma model without any restriction on the coefficients .",
    "however , they neither gave an explicit form of the solution nor proved the ergodicity .",
    "a similar result can be found in ling @xcite .",
    "@xcite gave a sufficient condition for the ergodicity of the solution for a first order tma model under some restrictive conditions .",
    "these results have been extended to the first - order tma model with more than two regimes",
    ". however , the uniqueness and the ergodicity of the solution are still open problems for higher - order tma models .    in this paper",
    ", we use a different approach to study the tma model without resorting to the markov chain theory .",
    "note that the tma model involves a feedback control mechanism .",
    "an intuitive and simple idea is to seek a closed form of the solution in terms of the above mechanism , which is expressible as an indicator function .",
    "we can show that for the tma model there always exists a unique strictly stationary and ergodic solution without any restriction on the coefficients of the tma model .",
    "more importantly , for the first time in the literature , an explicit / closed form of the solution is derived .",
    "in addition , for the correlation structure , we show that the acf ( when it exists ) of the tma model typically does not cut off .",
    "in fact , it has a much richer structure .",
    "for example , it can exhibit almost long memory , although it generally decays at an exponential rate .",
    "furthermore , the difference between the joint two - dimensional distribution and the corresponding product of its marginal distributions also decays to zero at an exponential rate as the lag tends to infinity .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] discusses the strict stationarity and ergodicity of the tma model .",
    "section [ sec3 ] studies the asymptotic behaviour of the acf of the tma model and other correlation structure .",

    "the basic idea for theorem [ sethm1 ] is a direct and concrete expression in terms of @xmath20 , without resorting to the markov chain theory .",
    "theorem [ sethm1 ] shows that the @xmath0 model is always stationary and ergodic as is the @xmath21 model .",
    "the acf plays a crucial role in studying the correlation structure of weakly stationary time series .",
    "it is well known that for a causal @xmath22 model , its acf @xmath23 goes to zero at an exponential rate as @xmath24 diverges to infinity .",
    "the exact formula for acf can be obtained although its closed form is not compact . however , for a general nonlinear time series model , it is rather difficult to obtain an exact formula for the acf and to study the asymptotic behaviour .",
    "additionally , the notion of memory , short or long , is closely associated with the acf .",
    "one significant fact is that a causal @xmath22 model is short - memory . for a general nonlinear time series model , due to its complicated structure",
    ", there is no universally accepted criterion for determining whether or not it is short - memory . as for some specific time series model , an ad hoc approach is usually adopted .",
    "one important characteristic of the @xmath21 model is that its acf cuts off after lag @xmath3 .",
    "interestingly , this property is not generally inherited by the tma model ; this is not surprising theoretically because the tma model involves some nonlinear feedback . another",
    "interesting fact is that although a tma model is generally short - memory , in some cases it can exhibit some almost long - memory phenomena ; see example [ seex4 ] .",
