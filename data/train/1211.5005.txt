    "since its discovery in 2004 graphene  @xcite draws much attention because of unique features of this two - dimensional system .",
    "graphene is composed of a sp@xmath2-bonded carbon atoms forming honeycomb structure .",
    "it became famous for its very interesting electronic structure with characteristic , linear energy dispersion near k point of brillouin zone and many other features  @xcite .",
    "shortly after , experimental techniques allowed fabrication of other new two - dimensional materials , like bn and mos@xmath3 honeycomb structures  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of such stable two - dimensional materials triggered search for similar structures made from different compounds .",
    "up to now many of these hypothetical structures constructed from silanene ( 2d si ) and germanene ( 2d ge )  @xcite , iii - v compounds  @xcite , sic  @xcite or zno  @xcite have been studied theoretically .",
    "also , calculations show  @xcite , that graphene - like type of structure is not the only one possible for two - dimensional material .",
    "this new class of boron sheets , composed of triangular and hexagonal motifs can be stabilized by interplay of three- and two - center bonding scheme  @xcite .",
    "another example of triangular sheet could be found in already known material , which is li@xmath4n in its @xmath5 phase .",
    "li@xmath6n is a bulk material known to be a fast ion conductor  @xcite .",
    "li@xmath6n is also known as a candidate for hydrogen storage material due its high theoretical h@xmath0 capacity  @xcite .",
    "bulk li@xmath4n crystallizes in hexagonal structure which is characterized by @xmath7 symmetry group , each nitrogen atom is surrounded by eight lithium atoms .",
    "it has layered structure , one layer is li@xmath0n and the other is of li atoms only .",
    "previous theoretical studies confirm ionic nature of bonding in this compound  @xcite .",
    "since n - containing layer is rather weakly bound with two li - only layers , it would be interesting to study electronic properties of such two - dimensional structure ( 2dli@xmath0n ) - fig [ fig0]a .",
    "since this structure would have n atoms with dangling bonds , it would give opportunity to study influence of different atoms addition on them .",
    "for example addition of hydrogen atoms in case of graphene resulted in new material which is graphane  @xcite .",
    "graphene and other nano - scale materials are recognized as future building blocks of new electronics technologies  @xcite , including spintronics  @xcite . in the case of low ( one- and two- ) dimensional structures problem",
    "arises because of famous mermin - wagner theorem  @xcite , which prevents ferro- or antiferromagnetic order to occur in finite temperatures , which is essential for practical application .",
    "this started the theoretical and experimental search for magnetism in graphene and other two - dimensional structures .",
    "one of the most promising directions is emergence of magnetism in such structures as an effect of presence of local defects  @xcite . according to works of palacios et al .",
    "@xcite and , independently , of yazyev  @xcite single - atom defects can induce ferromagnetism in graphene based materials . in both cases , the magnetic order arises as an effect of presence of single - atom defects in combination with a sublattice discriminating mechanism . in the case of @xmath8role of such defect",
    "could play non - hydrogenated n atom in hydrogenated structure .",
    "it would be then instructive to check influence of hydrogenation level on magnetic moment of the structure . in this paper electronic and magnetic structure of pure and hydrogenated 2dli@xmath0n",
    "have been analyzed by means of @xmath9-@xmath10 calculations .",
    "to investigate electronic and magnetic properties of two - dimensional li@xmath4n structures a series of @xmath9-@xmath10 calculations have been conducted with use of dft vasp code  @xcite with paw potentials  @xcite . for both spin - unpolarized and spin - polarized cases exchange - correlation potential has been approximated by generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) using pw91 functional  @xcite .",
    "kinetic energy cutoff of 500 ev for plane - wave basis set has been used . in all cases for self - consistent structure optimizations , the brillouin zone ( bz ) was sampled by @xmath11 special k points .",
    "all structures have been optimized for both , spin - unpolarized and spin - polarized cases unless feynman - hellman forces acting on each atom become smaller than 10@xmath12 ev/@xmath13 .",

    "bandstructure and density of states ( dos ) calculations have been confirmed by use of wien2k code  @xcite which implements the full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw ) method @xcite . in this case for exchange and correlation generalized gradient approximation",
    "was used in the perdew - burke - ernzerhoff ( pbe ) parameterization @xcite .",
    "to study electronic properties of @xmath8 , at first comparison has been made with bulk material . for both cases lattice constants",
    "have been determined by total energy calculations and are found to be equal to 3.65   for bulk ( experimental value 3.63  ) and 3.57   for @xmath8 . in agreement with  @xcite bulk li@xmath4n",
    "is a semiconductor with non - direct bandgap equal to 1.15 ev between a ( valence band ) and @xmath14 ( conduction band ) points . in contradiction to this , @xmath8  has metallic nature .",
    "two - dimensional structure is rather weakly bound - binding energy ( defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the energy of isolated atom(s ) and @xmath17 is the total energy of two - dimensional structure ) is equal to 10.36 ev , while binding energy of bulk structure is equal to 14.25 ev .",
    "also , two dimensional sheet would have n atoms with dangling bonds , such structure would be then rather unstable with respect to foreign atoms addition .",
    "graphane case suggests that it would be instructive to examine influenece of hydrogenation on electronic structure in such cases as well as addition of lithium atoms .",
    "the nature of li - n bond is ionic , as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] showing charge density projected on [ 110 ] plane .",
    "since every bond has both ionic and covalent character the level of ionicity can be estimated using difference between electronegativities of bonded atoms  @xcite . in the case of li -",
    "n bond this difference equal to 2 suggests , that the bond is about 65@xmath18 ionic and 35@xmath18covalent .",
    "this fact together with rather large lattice constant suggest that the structure of two - dimensional @xmath8  can be low - buckled ( lb ) rather than plane ( pl ) , according to puckering mechanism described in  @xcite . to check",
    "this the series of calculations has been done , each with different distance in z direction between li atoms and the plane on which n atoms lie ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the structure with minimal energy has been then optimized .",
    "calculations show , that the buckled structure with @xmath19 = x lies 0.54 ev lower that the plane , which means that indeed the puckering mechanism stabilizes the structure . both",

    "four structures have been then studied in two conformations , plane and low - buckled  two ( pl and lb ) with single h atom attached on top of each n atom ( 2dli@xmath0n+h ) , two with two h atoms attached on both sides of n ( 2dli@xmath0n+2h ) , two with single li atom attached on top of each n atom ( 2dli@xmath0n+li ) , and two with two li atoms attached on both sides of n ( 2dli@xmath0n+2li ) .

    "@xmath20-@xmath10 calculations have been conducted for hypothetical two - dimensional material @xmath8  to investigate electronic and magnetic properties .",
    "calculations show , that structure is much more stable when dangling bonds of nitrogen atoms are functionalized with hydrogen atoms .",
    "this hydrogenation has very strong influence on on bandstructure , changing it from wide - gap semiconductor to metal .",
    "magnetic properties are also interesting . in analogy to graphene and other two - dimensional materials it is possible to generate non - zero magnetic moment by introduction of distorsion . in the case of @xmath8",
    "the distorsion would be a two - hydrogen or hydrohen - lithium vacancy around the same nitrogen atom .",
    "this generates magnetic moment of 1 @xmath1 .",
    "since bulk li@xmath4n material has ususally 1 - 2% li vacancies in li@xmath0n layers  @xcite such two - dimensional hydrogenated sheet would be almost naturally magnetic",
