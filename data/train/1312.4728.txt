    "the quantum casimir effect is the first and most famous example of what are commonly referred to as the _ fluctuation induced interactions _ @xcite .",
    "the idea behind the original calculation by casimir is quite straightforward to describe in principle but is at the same time mathematically quite technical and , in addition , rather subtle to interpret physically @xcite .",
    "the basic point is nevertheless clear : the presence of two conducting plates modifies the ground state energy of the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "the ground state , or zero point energy , then has a finite component which depends on the plate separation , but also a divergent contribution which is fortunately independent of the plate separation , thus leading to a finite force .",
    "a physically measurable force is therefore derivable from @xmath0 , the quantum ground state energy .",
    "this is somewhat embarrassing as physics students are often confidently told that the ground state energy can be thrown away in condensed matter and quantum field calculations , since only differences in energy should count .",
    "the question as to whether zero point energy has physically measurable consequences is an important one in cosmology as it is a possible candidate for dark energy @xcite .",
    "another query arising from casimir s computation , based on zero point energy , is why is the effect then usually referred to as a fluctuation induced interaction ?",
    "one computes the ground state energy @xmath1 of a system of harmonic oscillators which , up to an infinite but constant term , is a function of the plate separation @xmath2 and the ensuing force is simply @xmath3 .",
    "what is fluctuating here ?",
    "the uncertainty principle tells us the local electromagnetic field fluctuates but it is not clear physically why such fluctuations should give rise to a force . the fluctuation aspect of casimir interactions and their generalization , the van der waals forces , has been worked out particularly in detail by lifshitz . in his landmark paper ,",
    "lifshitz used rytov s fluctuating electrodynamics to derive the average stress tensor in a planar geometry bounded by two dielectric and/or conducting bodies @xcite .",
    "this represents the _ field view _ of fluctuation induced electromagnetic forces , in distinction to the _ matter view _ where these interactions are caused by correlated dipolar fluctuations , yielding the long range van der waals interactions .",
    "it is thus natural and unsurprising to call van der waals interactions fluctuation induced interactions @xcite . indeed , schwinger was unhappy about the zero - point energy interpretation of the casimir interaction to such an extent that this led him to formulate the effect in terms of the currents and sources alone @xcite .",
    "physically , and in analogy with the van der waals dipolar fluctuation case , this leads to the realization that a conductor has free charges which move in such a way to effectively impose conducting boundary conditions in maxwell s equations and the casimir effect is thus due to the correlation of the charge fluctuations between the two plates in just the same way as van der waals forces are due to correlations of the dipole fluctuations . even with these deep insights into the nature of the casimir effect , and van der waals and fluctuation induced interaction in general , the discussion about zero point energy versus",
    "charge and current fluctuations continues unabated to this day @xcite .",
    "recently the representation of dielectric bodies in terms of thermalized dipoles has been exploited to study the classical high temperature behavior of van der waals forces @xcite .",
    "the dipole field representation is also useful because it allows one to study the dynamics of how the van der waals interactions evolve in time , as correlations between two initially uncorrelated dielectric slabs set in ( the fluctuations of the force in equilibrium may also be studied @xcite ) .",
    "the input into such a theory is a local langevin dynamics for the dipole field .",
    "the classical equilibrium thermal interaction between two semi - infinite planar slabs of area @xmath4 separated by a distance @xmath2 is given by @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the hamaker coefficient measured in units of @xmath7 .",
    "two initially uncorrelated slabs are then found to have a time dependent interaction of the form @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a time dependent hamaker coefficient with @xmath10 , corresponding to zero force for initially uncorrelated slabs , and @xmath11 .",
    "one should note however that the factorization of the temporal and spatial dependence in eq .",
    "( [ dipd ] ) is particular to planar geometries and does not have straightforward analogies in other geometries .",
    "few other results are known about the temporal evolution of fluctuation induced forces .",
    "most results on the electromagnetic casimir effect concern steady state out of equilibrium situations where the temperatures of the bodies in interaction are taken to be different @xcite , these systems are thus in non - equilibrium but steady states .",
    "in addition , the quantum casimir - polder interaction between atoms and surfaces has been studied in a number of out of equilibrium contexts @xcite . here",
    "one can also study the evolution of a quantum state of the system which is not a stationary state , as well as the casimir friction effect due to the motion of the atom @xcite .",
    "these studies are more closely related to the one that will be presented here in that we study the evolution of the casimir force in an initially out off equilibrium state to its equilibrium value .    in soft matter type systems , where a multitude of fluctuation induced interactions exist",
    ", there are only analytical results for simple gaussian models of binary mixtures with stochastic non - conserved order parameter ( model a ) dynamics . here",
    "the temporal and @xmath2 dependence of the force are mixed via a diffusive scaling dependence @xmath12 @xcite . in principle ,",
    "near critical binary liquid mixtures are ideal systems to observe out of equilibrium casimir interactions , due to the critical slowing down of dynamics as a critical point is approached . however , in such systems , hydrodynamics needs to be taken into account and the problem becomes very difficult , even in the regime of low reynolds number where flows can be treated as stokes flows . the first results for such systems have been obtained only very recently and require quite sophisticated numerical techniques @xcite . as is the case for the electromagnetic casimir effect , the critical casimir effect out of equilibrium can also be studied via the induced drag and diffusion on insertions which interact with the fluctuating field @xcite    in this paper we will examine the interaction between two _ model conducting surfaces _ that contain mobile cations and anions interacting via the three dimensional coulomb interaction and whose dynamics is governed by a langevin equation .",
    "this model describes 2d electrolyte layers or thin colloidal layers when hydrodynamic effects can be neglected , but can be also viewed as a generic classical model of 2d conductors .",
    "the dynamics of the system is treated analogously to the debye - hckel ( dh ) approximation , where fluctuations of the local density of anions and cations about the average density is taken to be small .",
    "the statics of this model in the dh approximation has been studied in refs . @xcite and",
    "the model is called the _ living conductor model _ by the authors of @xcite .",
    "the motivation for these studies was in fact how to better understand the role of charge fluctuations in conductors and their effect on the casimir interaction in order to understand the extrapolation of the quantum casimir effect , based on perfectly conducting boundary conditions , to the high temperature limit .",
    "the choice of terminology living conductor was chosen by the authors of @xcite to emphasize the presence of real charge distributions in the plates as opposed to conducting boundary conditions imposed on the electromagnetic field .    in this model , and under the dh approximation , we will study how the casimir force between two initially uncorrelated plates evolves in time .",
    "the basic model consists of diffusing ions confined to both plates , each plate representing a confined 2d electrolyte .",
    "the electrolytes have a screening length beyond which electrostatic interactions are weak . for plate separations",
    "much larger than this screening length the equilibrium interaction has a universal , perfect conductor , limit . for separations smaller than the screening length ,",
    "the interaction is non - universal and depends explicitly on the screening length .",
    "we will present analytical results for the evolution of the casimir interaction in both the long range and short range regimes .",
    "the temporal evolution for the force is surprisingly rich and is quite different in the short and long distance regimes . in the long distance",
    "universal regime we shall also see that the temporal evolution of the force is quite different to that of the dipole model studied before @xcite , despite the fact that the same universal static limit can be realized in the two models .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first describe the basic model in terms of its statics and dynamics and also give a simple and explicit expression for the force between the two plates in terms of the charge densities of the system .",
    "the dynamics of the system is then solved by expanding the density fields about their mean values to first order , in terms of statics this approximation corresponds to the dh approximation .",
    "expressions are then given for the laplace transform of the time dependent force between two initially nonconducting plates which pass through an insulating to conducting transition . from this expression",
    "we can easily extract the equilibrium value of the force .",
    "we identify two static limits , a long distance universal limit , where the thermal casimir force is independent of the microscopic model for the charges in the plates , and a short distance non - universal regime where the scaling of the force with separation changes and a dependence on the microscopic parameters of the model appears .",
    "there then follows a rather technical passage where we carry out an asymptotic analysis of the laplace transform of the force to extract its short and late time behaviors in both the universal and non - universal regimes .",
    "we conclude by discussing the difference between the results found here and those in other studies of the relaxation of thermal casimir forces and further perspectives in this line of study .",
    "in a medium of dielectric constant @xmath13    we consider two parallel plates @xmath14 and @xmath15 of area @xmath4 separated by distance @xmath2 in the direction we denote by @xmath16 .",
    "a schematic of the system is shown in fig .",
    "( [ schema ] ) .",
    "we set @xmath14 at @xmath17 and @xmath15 at @xmath18 . in the problem",
    "we consider cations / anions of several types denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "the ions of type @xmath19 have a charge @xmath20 and are in the plate @xmath21 ( @xmath21 = @xmath14 if the ions of type @xmath19 are in the plate @xmath22 etc . )",
    ". furthermore the ions are langevin particles with diffusion constant @xmath23 .",
    "each particle is thus subjected to a thermal white noise plus the electric field generated by the other particles ( including those not in the same plate ) .",
    "the density field for the particles obeys a stochastic partial differential equation which can be derived starting from the langevin equations of the individual particles @xcite or , as was originally done , from phenomenological arguments @xcite . for a system of different particle types the derivation of @xcite",
    "can be easily extended to give @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the two dimensional coordinate in the plane of the plates and @xmath26 is the corresponding 2d gradient operator .",
    "the functional @xmath27 is an effective free energy functional for the density fields given by @xmath28 the first term above is the electrostatic energy of the system and @xmath29 is the green s function obeying @xmath30 with @xmath31 the background dielectric constant of the system .",
    "the second term in the functional @xmath27 corresponds to the entropic contribution @xmath32 due to the ionic distributions .",
    "the term @xmath33 is spatio - temporal gaussian white noise with correlation function @xmath34 note that the diffusive dynamics above conserves the total particle number of each species , in what follows we assume that each plate is electro - neutral .",
    "the force between the two plates as a functional of the densities @xmath35 is then given by @xmath36 where only interactions between charges on different plates contribute to the normal force between the plates .",
    "finally we need to specify the initial conditions from which the system evolves . quickly moving the plates in close proximity and",
    "then observing the evolution of the force seems difficult to achieve .",
    "a different initial condition would be to start with plates which initially have no free charges and then pass through an insulator / conductor - like transition by tuning an external parameter such as the temperature .",
    "the initial condition we shall consider is therefore one where the local charge density is initially zero in both plates . more specifically ,",
    "if the system is initially made up of bound ion cation pairs , we assume that the initial density of pairs is uniform and the corresponding ionic distributions upon unbinding are thus initially uniform .",
    "in order to proceed we expand the density field for each species about its mean value , writing @xmath37 the equation of motion for the density fluctuations @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 where we have assumed that each plate is electroneutral , i.e. @xmath40 . the dynamical equivalent of the dh approximation amounts to keeping only terms which are first order in @xmath41 . in the second noise term this amounts to keeping only the term @xmath42 , as the first linear term has average @xmath43 and will only enter corrections quadratically .",
    "the dynamics in this approximation becomes equivalent to model b conserved dynamics employed in the study of phase ordering kinetics @xcite .",
    "the effective equation thus becomes linear and can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the vector with components @xmath38 . by @xmath46",
    "we denote the composition of operators .",
    "the noise @xmath47 has correlation function @xmath48 from this the dynamical operator @xmath49 can be read off as @xmath50 and we also find that @xmath51 it is easy to see that one has @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the dh approximation to the free energy functional in eq .",
    "( [ fe ] ) where it is expanded to second order in @xmath54 .",
    "the equal time correlation function @xmath55 is straightforward to compute and we find ( in operator notation where we suppress the spatial dependence of the operators for notational succinctness ) @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the initial correlation function . in the case",
    "considered here we start with an initial insulator condition with @xmath58 in both plates , this means that the initial distribution of each charge type is uniform at the moment where the dynamics begins .",
    "we therefore set @xmath59 .",
    "the average force as a function of time is given by @xmath60 here the only terms present are from charge distributions in different plates so we have @xmath61_{\\alpha\\beta}({\\bf x}-{\\bf x}'){\\partial \\over\\partial l}g({\\bf x}-{\\bf x}',l).\\ ] ] as seems to be generic with the dynamics of gaussian fluctuation induced forces @xcite , the analysis is greatly simplified by working with the laplace transform of the average time dependent force @xmath62 this gives in operator notation @xmath63 where we have used eq .",

    "we can now write , as in previous studies @xcite , @xmath64 where @xmath65 as the second term dependent on @xmath66 is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "note that this result is formally similar to that found in @xcite for general gaussian fluctuating fields confined between ( and not in ) the surfaces , however the physical models and assumptions made are somewhat different .",

    "( [ fis ] ) having surface terms can be evaluated using a variety of path integral or functional integral techniques @xcite .",

    "we analyze this result , and notably carry out the inversion of the laplace transform to deduce the temporal evolution of the force .",
    "in the static limit @xmath80 the equilibrium force is given via the pole at @xmath76 , we thus find @xmath81 where @xmath82 the @xmath83 represent the inverse of length scales @xmath84 beyond which the interaction between ions in the same plates are screened . these fix length scales which determine the casimir interaction between the plates , the large distance limit where @xmath85 and the short distance limit where @xmath86 .",
    "in the limit where @xmath87 we find that @xmath88 this is the universal limit for conductors in the classical limit . its value is half that obtained by taking the high temperature limit of the ideal conductor casimir limit , however it is the same result as that given by lifshitz theory .",
    "this subtlety of the high temperature limit of the casimir effect was in fact what inspired the authors of refs @xcite and @xcite to study this _ living conductor _ model .",
    "the finite distance corrections are easily computed to first order giving @xmath89,\\label{eqpc}\\ ] ] which agrees with the correction given in @xcite where the case @xmath90 is considered .",
    "now in the opposite limit where the plate separation is smaller than both their individual screening lengths , @xmath91 , we find @xmath92 giving a completely different scaling form when compared with the long distance limit .",
    "we first note that the interaction force in this limit is not universal , but depends on @xmath93 .",
    "the inter - surface distance scaling can be understood as follows : monopolar charge fluctuations between two point - like charge distributions give a free energy that goes as the inverse first power of the separation squared , just as the dipolar fluctuations scale as the inverse third power of the separation squared ; a hamaker - like summation of the inverse second power forces , distributed uniformly over two apposed planar surfaces , then yields a net force that scales as the inverse first power of the separation between the planar layers . a crucial point leading to eq .",
    "( [ mpstat ] ) is however that the monopolar charge fluctuations are correlated leading to an attractive force .",
    "the very short time behavior of the force is easy to extract . in this limit",
    "we assume that for all @xmath19 that @xmath94 .",
    "this means that we can take @xmath95 in eq .",
    "( [ flt ] ) and we find @xmath96 where @xmath97 and thus @xmath98 the inversion of the laplace transform in this large @xmath66 limit corresponds to short times and we find @xmath99 as is seen for systems of interacting dipoles ,",
    "the growth of the force as @xmath100 is a signal of the fact that it is correlation induced and thus in a sense is second order in time .",
    "however , the short time scaling with @xmath2 is quite different to the dipole case as is seen in eq ( [ dipd ] ) .",
    "we also see straight away that , in contrast with the dipole case , the time scales for the evolution of the force are dependent on @xmath2 .",
    "this is somewhat surprising as , in common with the dipole case , the effective interaction is again generated by an instantaneous coulomb interaction ( in the dipole case the interaction between the partial charges on the dipoles is of course coulombic ) .",
    "here we consider how the force evolves at late times to its static value . as there are two distinct regimes for the statics determined by the relative values of @xmath2 and @xmath84 we need to consider them separately .",
    "as in the static case we consider the change of variables @xmath101 and we recall that @xmath102 so that late time , or large @xmath103 , dynamics corresponds to small @xmath66 .",
    "the dynamical inverse screening lengths behave as @xmath104 an expansion taking @xmath73 small is thus valid if @xmath105 the presence of the exponential in the integrand , and the fact that the integral vanishes for small @xmath106 means that the integral is dominated by @xmath107 and thus we must have @xmath108 now in the late time regime defined by @xmath109 the above reduces to the condition to be in the short range static regime @xmath110 . in this regime",
    "the laplace transform of the force is given by @xmath111 in this form the laplace transform for the time derivative of the force can be inverted to give @xmath112 the prime in the sum indicating that @xmath19 and @xmath113 are species in different plates and we have defined @xmath114 .",
    "fortunately the right hand side of eq ( [ int1 ] ) can also be written as a temporal derivative and so we obtain @xmath115 the integral over @xmath74 can be expressed in terms of the complementary error function @xmath116 as @xmath117 the late time correction term is positive so the magnitude of the average force approaches its equilibrium value from below with diffusive scaling .",
    "the appearance of diffusive scaling is interesting in itself .",
    "even though @xmath118 represents the distance diffused by an ion of type @xmath19 , the ions diffuse in the plates , not across the gap between the plates and the coulomb interaction is instantaneous !",
    "the ions thus have to diffuse a distance of the order of the distance between the plates in order for the force to reach its equilibrium value , however this distance , in this limit , is less than the screening length .    in the limit where @xmath119 we can use taylor expansion of @xmath120 , @xmath121 to find @xmath122",
    "so the late time correction is independent of @xmath2 and decays as @xmath123 , this is reminiscent of the late time correction for gaussian binary liquids where the force decays to its equilibrium value with a power law in time , independent of the plate separations @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic inversion of the laplace transform is quite subtle in the long range limit where @xmath124 . in order to consider a system with only one intrinsic length scale and one intrinsic time scale we consider a perfectly symmetric system where all ions and anions have the same value of @xmath125 and the same diffusion constant @xmath126 .",
    "hence we consider the case where all the ions are cations are identical up to a change in the sign of their charge . as a consequence",
    "we can write @xmath127 where @xmath128 with @xmath129 the number of cations and anions in the ( identical ) plates . in this case",
    "we find @xmath130[s + 2d k^2 + mdk(1- \\exp(-kl))]},\\ ] ] and the laplace transform develops poles which are easy to find analytically and so it can be inverted to give @xmath131\\over   ( 2k + m - m\\exp(-kl))}- \\right.\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left.{1-\\exp\\left [ - dtk(2k + m+m\\exp(-kl))\\right]\\over   ( 2k + m+m\\exp(-kl))}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this we can easily verify the results for short time regime in this special case . as the final static result is known , it is easiest to study the force dynamics via the temporal derivative @xmath132- \\exp\\left [ -dtk ( 2k + m+m\\exp(-kl))\\right]\\right).\\ ] ] if we measure both the distance between the plates and the diffusion constant in terms of the screening length @xmath133 , i.e. we write @xmath134 and @xmath135 , then we find @xmath136- \\exp\\left [ -g_+(u,\\tilde dt,\\alpha)\\right]\\right).\\ ] ] where @xmath137 and @xmath138 . in the late time limit",
    "@xmath139 the functions @xmath140 simplify to @xmath141 and so the temporal derivative of the force has the scaling form @xmath142 we see that in this limit the behavior of the force evolution is not diffusive and is determined by the _ ballistically _ scaled parameter @xmath143 rather than the diffusively scaled one @xmath144 .    in the limit",
    "@xmath145 one can show @xmath146 which leads to @xmath147 subsequently at late times @xmath148 in the opposite limit @xmath149 we find asymptotically @xmath150 the first term being a much better approximation for @xmath151 for numerical verification of our analytical asymptotic estimates . in the regime of @xmath19 large",
    "we thus find @xmath152 this agrees with the general short time result given by eq .",
    "( [ st ] ) .    in this large distance regime",
    "we see that while the static behavior has a well defined universal limit , independent of the microscopic details of the charges in the plates , the temporal behavior is strongly non - universal and depends on the parameters of the surface charges .",
    "we have studied the thermal fluctuation induced interaction between two plates that are modeled as 2d conductors containing mobile anions and cations .",
    "we analyzed the static limit as well as the dynamical approach to this limit .",
    "the attractive interaction is found to be not surprisingly a consequence of the build - up of correlations between the charge distributions on the two plates .",
    "our results are however significantly different from those found between dielectric slabs studied in detail before @xcite . while the static thermal casimir interaction in the universal limit can also be obtained by approximating the interaction between dielectric slabs with diverging dielectric constants , the dynamics of the two systems is radically different and can not be extracted from this simplification .",
    "the late time relaxation of the van der waals force between dielectric slabs is typically given by a simple exponential relaxation of the effective hamaker coefficient ( unless one invokes a power law distribution of dipole relaxation times ) while the dynamics of the thermal casimir effect in the model here has a much richer phenomenology .",
    "in fact , for plates with mobile anions and cations the behavior of the force is a complicated function of plate separation @xmath2 and time @xmath103 .",
    "several regimes were identified . in the short distance regime , where effective charge fluctuations appear monopolar , the relaxation to the equilibrium force exhibits diffusive scaling . in the large separation regime",
    "the static result is universal , and the dynamical behavior exhibits a ballistic - like scaling .",
    "results obtained from the model a ( non - conserved order parameter ) dynamics for gaussian binary mixtures exhibit a diffusive scaling in the evolution of the casimir force to its equilibrium value @xcite .",
    "however , the dynamics in this case occurs in the medium between the two plates , the only influence of the plates is to impose boundary conditions .",
    "the appearance of the scaling variable @xmath12 is thus natural as the fluctuations of the order parameter in the @xmath16 direction between the plates obey a randomly ( thermally ) forced diffusion equation and relax over a region of size @xmath2 . in the model considered here ,",
    "nothing actually diffuses in the medium between the plates , all diffusion being confined within the plates and so in the _ living conductor _ model the diffusive scaling is not as easy to anticipate and is quite unexpected on physical grounds .",
    "finally we note that the dynamics of the living conductor model is also a possible test bed for other non - equilibrium studies of the casimir effect , for instance one could model plates held at different temperatures by taking a different amplitude of the thermal noise in each plate .",
    "one could also explore the effect of non - thermal driving on the dynamics of the ions in the plates .",
    "the influence of hydrodynamics , due to the presence of a solvent , on the dynamics of the charges would also be interesting to examine .",

    "<S> we investigate the dynamics of thermal casimir interactions between plates described within a _ living conductor _ model , with embedded mobile anions and cations , whose density field obeys a stochastic partial differential equation which can be derived starting from the langevin equations of the individual particles . </S>",
    "<S> this model describes the thermal casimir interaction in the same way that the fluctuating dipole model describes van der waals interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the model is analytically solved in a debye - hckel - like approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we identify several limiting dynamical regimes where the time dependence of the thermal casimir interactions can be obtained explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> most notably we find a regime with diffusive scaling , even though the charges are confined to the plates and do not diffuse into the intervening space , which makes the diffusive scaling difficult to anticipate and quite unexpected on physical grounds . </S>"
