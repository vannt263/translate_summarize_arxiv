    "the precise relation between optical / uv light detected and dust emission in the far infrared ( fir ) of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is difficult to establish observationally , because of the faintness of the expected fir luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this work we study this relation using direct simulations of galaxy formation in the standard cosmological constant - dominated cold dark matter model ( lcdm ;",
    "* ) in light of the capabilities of the upcoming atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) mission .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we detail our simulations , method of making galaxy catalogs and a dust obscuration analysis method .",
    "results are presented in  3 , followed by conclusions given in  4 .",
    "we perform cosmological simulations with the adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) eulerian hydro code , enzo @xcite .",
    "first we ran a low resolution simulation with a periodic box of @xmath13mpc on a side .",
    "we identified a region centered on a cluster of mass of @xmath14 at @xmath15 and then resimulate it with high resolution , embedded in the outer @xmath16mpc box .",
    "the refined region for  c \" run has a size of @xmath17mpc@xmath18 and represents @xmath19 fluctuation on that volume .",
    "the dark matter particle mass in the refined region is @xmath20 .",
    "the refined region is surrounded by three layers ( each of @xmath21mpc ) of buffer zones with particle masses successively larger by a factor of @xmath22 for each layer , which then connects with the outer root grid that has a dark matter particle mass @xmath23 times that in the refined region .",
    "we choose the mesh refinement criterion such that the resolution is always better than @xmath0pc physical , corresponding to a maximum mesh refinement level of @xmath24 at @xmath15 .",
    "the simulations include a metagalactic uv background @xcite , a model for shielding of uv radiation by neutral hydrogen @xcite , metallicity - dependent radiative cooling @xcite extended down to @xmath25k @xcite and all relevant gas chemistry chains for molecular hydrogen formation @xcite , including molecular formation on dust grains @xcite .",
    "star particles are created in cells that satisfy a set of criteria for star formation proposed by @xcite .",
    "supernova feedback from star formation is modeled following @xcite .",
    "we allow the entire feedback processes to be hydrodynamically coupled to surroundings and subject to relevant physical processes , such as cooling and heating .",
    "see @xcite for all other simulation details and physical treatments .",
    "we use the following cosmological parameters that are consistent with the wmap7-normalized @xcite lcdm model : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we identify galaxies in our high resolution simulations using the hop algorithm @xcite , operated on the stellar particles , which is tested to be robust .",
    "satellites within a galaxy are clearly identified separately .",
    "the luminosity of each stellar particle at each of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) five bands is computed using the gissel stellar synthesis code @xcite , by supplying the formation time , metallicity and stellar mass .",
    "collecting luminosity and other quantities of member stellar particles , gas cells and dark matter particles yields the following physical parameters for each galaxy : position , velocity , total mass , stellar mass , gas mass , mean formation time , mean stellar metallicity , mean gas metallicity , star formation rate , luminosities in five sdss bands ( and various colors ) and others . at a spatial resolution of @xmath32pc with nearly 5000 well resolved galaxies at @xmath3 ,",
    "this simulated galaxy catalog presents an excellent tool to study galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "a fully self - consistent modeling would be difficult , given our lack of knowledge of the distribution of dust and its properties .",
    "here we take a simplified approach .",
    "given the 3-d distribution of gas with varying metallicity and stellar particles distributed within it , the observed sfr at a rest - frame uv wavelength @xmath33 for the galaxy is computed as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the extinction optical depth at some uv wavelength @xmath33 for an individual stellar particle @xmath36 of star formation rate @xmath37 in the galaxy from its individual location @xmath38 to the observer : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is visual extinction @xmath41 per unit hydrogen column density per unit solar metallicity for @xmath42 @xcite and @xmath43 ( a fitting function ) is taken from @xcite ; @xmath44 is the column density - weighted mean metallicity of gas obscuring the stellar particle @xmath36 in solar units and @xmath45 is the integrated hydrogen column density from the stellar particle @xmath36 to the observer .",
    "note that in equation  ( [ eq : sfruv ] ) the calculation is based on 3-d distributions of stellar particles that each are subject to their own integrated optical depth and the sum is over all the memeber stellar particles , typically of number @xmath46 for a galaxy of stellar mass @xmath47 . in equation  ( [ eq : taulambda ] )",
    "@xmath48 is a dimensionless parameter that we will adjust such that the simulated lbg uv luminosity function matches observations ; f should be of order unity , if dust properties for galaxies at @xmath49 are not drastically different from those derived locally and our galaxy formation model is realistic .",
    "as we will see below , the required value of @xmath48 is indeed close to unity with an adopted extinction law that is also close to those derived locally .",
    "thus , the dust extinction of sfr at a specific uv band is a good proxy of the overall extinction of sfr in the optical - to - uv regime .",
    "we will use the @xmath50 band for subsequent analysis .",
    "the portion of the sfr that does not escape in uv / optical is assumed to be converted to fir sfr : @xmath51 for each galaxy we place 95 random observers in its sky at infinity for results presented in the next section .",
    "this sampling is adequate and results are converged statistically .",
    "-0.5 cm -0 cm    the top panel of figure  [ fig : lfz2000 ] shows the sfr functions for total sfr , uv and fir selected galaxies , respectively .",
    "we have adjusted the parameter @xmath48 in equation  [ eq : taulambda ] to be @xmath52 to arrive at the excellent match between the computed uv sfr function and the observations at @xmath49 .",
    "we note that @xmath48 could be @xmath53 if one had adopted a slightly different @xmath54 @xcite . in any case , the results with @xmath55 with @xmath56 differ only slightly from the case with @xmath52 shown here and uv sfr function in that case is consistent with the observations within the errorbars .",
    "this also suggests that our overall results are robust and insensitive to small variations of uncertain parameters for the dust model within a reasonable range .",
    "it also implies that dust properties at @xmath49 are not significantly different from those of local dust .    after matching the observed uv sfr function , we see that the predicted fir sfr function agrees remarkably well with the observed lirg and ulirg data at @xmath3 ( top panel ) . as a consistency check ,",
    "we show in the bottom right panel of figure  [ fig : lfz2000 ] the cumulative sfr density at @xmath3 . here",
    "we see both the uv sfr density and fir sfr density agree well with observations .",
    "we see that , while the directly observed uv sfr density should be roughly equal to the directly observed fir sfr density , at face value , the uv sfr density is somewhat higher than fir sfr density .",
    "our results suggest that galaxies with higher sfr tend to have relatively larger obscuration in uv / optical than galaxies with lower sfr , resulting in a steepening uv luminosity function at the luminous end .",
    "the underlying cause will be discussed in figure  [ fig : comb ] .",
    "our previous studies @xcite indicate that the  c \" run used is positively biased over the cosmic mean by a factor of @xmath57 . taking that into account",
    ", we find that the simulated sfr function as well sfr density becomes too low compared to observed ones .",
    "a plausible adjustment is to the stellar imf .",
    "the results shown above uses an top - heavy imf that produces twice the uv light output per unit sfr than the standard salpeter function .",
    "this provides intriguing evidence for top - heavy imf at high redshift , consistent with other independent considerations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the abundance of massive , rare objects is expected to depend on box size as well as the overdensity of the environment .",
    "we assess this effect as follows .",
    "we divide the simulation box into eight equal - volume octants and compute the sfr function for each of the eight octants .",
    "the results for the eight sfr functions are shown as green curves in the bottom left panel of figure  [ fig : lfz2000 ] .",
    "we note two points here .",
    "first , at @xmath58/yr the sfr function is very well converged and does not appear to sensitively depend on environment .",
    "second , substantial variations are visible at @xmath59/yr , which suggests that the abundance of galaxies with sfr higher than @xmath60/yr depends sensitively on density environment and our positively biased simulation box likely has produced some over - abundance of galaxies with @xmath59/yr relative to galaxies with @xmath61/yr ; the computed uv sfr at @xmath59/yr in this simulation lies above the observed points is thus not inconsistent .",
    "a comparison between the thin and thick curves in the top panel of figure  [ fig : lfz2000 ] indicates that the resolutions achieved in the higher resolution run is required in order to provide an adequate match to observations .",
    "the lower ( four times spatially and eight times in mass ) resolution simulation of the same volume suffers from the two shortcomings .",
    "first , there is a slight overproduction of the highest sfr ( @xmath62  yr@xmath5 ) galaxies in the lower resolution simulation , which is due to a combination of slight overmerging and higher gas reservoir in the lower resolution run .",
    "second , there is a significant underproduction of lower sfr ( @xmath63  yr@xmath5 ) galaxies in the lower resolution simulation due to lower resolution .",
    "taking into account these two effects , the results can be understood and our main predictions on the faint slope and galaxy desert ( see below ) remain robust .",
    "our model makes several predictions .",
    "the first is that the differential fir sfr function displays a nearly perfect powerlaw of slope about @xmath8 below @xmath64/yr at @xmath3 .",
    "we attribute this outcome to a combination of three physical factors : ( 1 ) the intrinsic differential sfr function is steeper than than @xmath8 but close to @xmath65 , as indicated by the thin black line in the top panel of figure  [ fig : lfz2000 ] ; ( 2 ) on averagge , higher sfr galaxies have higher dust optical depth ( as discussed in detail in figure  [ fig : comb ] below ) that tends to flatten the fir sfr function ; ( 3 ) there is a significant dispersion of @xmath66 at a fixed intrinsic sfr ( see figure  [ fig : uvfir ] below ) that also smoothes and flattens the fir sfr function .",
    "this predictions can be tested by alma observations , and if confirmed , will provide evidence that the intrinsic sfr function is close to a powerlaw with a slope that is steeper than @xmath8 in the sfr range @xmath67yr@xmath5 .",
    "we attribute this behavior to a large dispersion of sfr at a fixed halo mass but will address it in more detail separately .    given this slope , most of the fir light is concentrated at the bright end . in terms of cumulative galaxy number density",
    "we find that uv and fir selected samples are expected to have comparable abundances at @xmath68/yr . in terms of cumulative sfr density",
    "we find that fir selected galaxies with @xmath69/yr dominate over uv selected galaxies with @xmath69/yr ; the reverse is true at @xmath70/yr .",
    "reading directly from simulations we find that fir selected galaxies with fir @xmath69/yr contain @xmath71 of total fir light density , whereas uv selected galaxies with uv @xmath69/yr contain only @xmath72 ( the actual number may be still lower , since our simulations likely have under - estimated the number density of galaxies below @xmath73/yr , below which a flattening of the uv sfr function is seen in the top panel of figure  [ fig : lfz2000 ] ) . note that while a schechter function normally fits halo functions well , it does not provide an adequate fit to the fir sfr function , due to large dispersions of sfr at fixed halo masses mentioned above .",
    "our results suggest that the observed uv - selected lbgs detected at @xmath74 a few @xmath75/yr at @xmath76 can account for the bulk of the fir background at @xmath77 , consistent with earlier independent observational assessments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "needless to say , our model implies that uv and fir selected galaxies form a complementary pair of populations that are drawn from the same underlying general galaxy population .",
    "this point has been noted by others ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "-0.0 cm    figure  [ fig : uvfir ] shows a scatter plot of galaxies in the @xmath78 plane .",
    "we see a nearly complete empty space at the lower right corner of the plot , with @xmath79^{2.1 } \\msun { \\rm yr}^{-1}$ ] , which we shall call the  galaxy desert \" .",
    "the physical reason for this nearly complete absence of galaxies with high uv sfr and low fir sfr rate is that the dust optical depth of galaxies increases with sfr",
    ". this second prediction of our model should be testable by alma observations .",

    "we see that for lbgs with @xmath80/yr , the distributions are well fitted by gaussians ( the black curves ) using @xmath81 as the variable . in the lowest @xmath12 ( @xmath82/yr )",
    "we see a slight tendency of the @xmath11 distribution to skew towards the low @xmath11 end , indicative of increasingly diminishing dust obscuration for galaxies with low sfr . in the highest @xmath12 ( @xmath83/yr ) , the @xmath11 distribution is significantly skewed to the high @xmath11 end for the same physical reason .",
    "we list the parameters of the best gaussian fit of @xmath11 distributions for all @xmath12 bins in table 1 .",
    "these predictions should be verifiable by alma observations .",
    "-0 cm -0 cm    finally , we examine the underlying cause of the generally differential rate of dust obscuration seen in prior figures where higher sfr galaxies are more dust obscured .",
    "figure  [ fig : comb ] shows gas metallicity and gas column density as a function of stellar mass and total sfr , respectively .",
    "examination of the top left panel of figure  [ fig : comb ] indicates that in the stellar mass range @xmath84 there is a positive correlation between gas metallicity and stellar mass , in agreement with the observed , so - called mass - metallicity relation at @xmath49 of @xcite .",
    "while this is not the focus of our study here , the agreement is quite remarkable but consistent with the agreement that is found between simulations and observations with respect to the metallicity distribution of damped lyman alpha systems in an earlier study @xcite .",
    "a comparison between the two top and two bottom panels of figure  [ fig : comb ] clearly indicates that the correlation between column density and stellar mass or sfr is about three times stronger than that between gas metallicity and stellar mass or sfr .",
    "this suggests that the general trend of larger dust obscuration for larger stellar mass or sfr is mostly due to a trend in column density in the same sense , but positively aided by a mass ( or sfr)-metallicity trend .",
    "this overall trend gives an integral constraint on the total optical depth .",
    "the actual distribution of dust optical depth at a given galaxy mass ( or sfr ) or even for a given galaxy viewed at different angels has large dispersions due to the clumpy distribution of gas with varying metallicity , resulting in a wide fir sfr distribution within a narrow uv sfr range , as quantified in figure  [ fig : firsfr ] .",
    "using state - of - the - art , adaptive mesh - refinement eulerian cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with high resolution ( @xmath0pc ) , large sample size ( @xmath1 galaxies of stellar mass @xmath2 ) and a physically sound treatment of relevant processes , we examine the properties of lbgs at @xmath3 with respect to their partitioning of uv and fir light . using a single scalar parameter that relates the amount of dust obscuration to the product of hydrogen column density and gas metallicity to model dust obscuration along each line of sight ( i.e.",
    ", a dust extinction law derived in our local universe ) , we find that the observed uv luminosity function for the entire range and fir luminosity function at the bright end can be simultaneously reproduced .",
    "our theoretical modeling affirms the aesthetically appealing picture where uv and fir selected galaxies at @xmath49 are drawn from the same general galaxy population .",
    "the observationally different manifestations are merely due to the known fact that each galaxy is seen through its own unique set of dust screens at a given viewing angle .",
    "star forming galaxies that are more massive or have higher sfr tend to have larger amounts of dust obscuration at high redshift .",
    "we predict that the fir luminosity function in the range @xmath7/yr is a powerlaw with a slope @xmath8 with uncertainty of @xmath85 .",
    "we further predict that there is a  galaxy desert \" at @xmath9 in the @xmath10 plane .",
    "detailed distributions of @xmath11 at an observed @xmath12 are quantified and can be used to further test the model .",
    "we expect that upcoming observations by alma should be able to test these predictions hence ultimately the standard cosmological model with respect to its properties on sub - megaparsec scales .",
    "if alma observations confirms the predicted faint end slope of the fir luminosity function , it would imply that the intrinsic sfr function of galaxies may be closer to a powerlaw of a slope at least as steep as @xmath65 in the range @xmath86 than a schechter function .",
