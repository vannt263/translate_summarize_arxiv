    "* ) incorporated the st magnetic viscosity prescription in a one  dimensional stellar evolution code that had previously been used to explore the effect on angular momentum transport of a wide variety of classical fluid instabilities @xcite .",
    "@xcite concluded that the st magnetic viscosity would tend to damp the rotation rate of the iron core that formed in the final stages of evolution of massive stars by a factor of 30 - 50 compared to computations that did not account for magnetic torques and that more massive stars would have more rapidly rotating iron cores .",
    "a variety of issues concerning the st mechanism remain open .",
    "we return to that topic in  [ discuss ] .",
    "although the mri has been thoroughly explored in the context of accretion disks , it also applies to quasi - spherical objects , e.g. stars @xcite . the mri is widely considered to play some role in core collapse @xcite , but its role in stellar evolution has been substantially neglected .",
    "this is in part because a threshold shear is required to trigger the mri and the mri tends to be stabilized by strong thermal and composition gradients @xcite . on the other hand , models of rotating massive stars",
    "naturally develop strong shear at composition boundaries , and the mri is subject to triply - diffusive destabilizing effects in radiative regions @xcite .",
    "the mri grows exponentially rapidly when unstable and can be active in the sun @xcite .",
    "we argue here that the mri should also be considered in the context of the evolution of massive stars .",
    "@xcite neglect the mri , but the resulting models tend to give very strong radial gradients in the angular velocity in the final stages of the evolution ( see figures 2 and 3 in heger et al . for the corresponding specific angular momentum gradient distributions ) .",
    "these sharp gradients arise at the composition boundaries of the  onion - skin \" layers that are also the boundaries between ( possibly extinct ) convective cores and outer radiative layers that may once themselves have been involved in convective burning .",
    "these sharp boundaries are stabilized against kelvin ",
    "helmholtz instabilities by the associated composition gradients , but they may be unstable to interface dynamos @xcite or the mri .",
    "one question is whether or not such sharp gradients in angular velocity would have developed in the first place had the mri been considered as the star evolved on and after the main sequence .    where in the geometry various instabilities occur is a major issue .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the tayler instability disappears on the equator and shows its most characteristic behavior near the rotation axis",
    ". the mri may be most active near the equator in radiative shearing regions where the shear is strong and weaker at the poles , but in the tachocline and convective envelope of the sun the mri tends to be supressed at low latitudes @xcite . in the following , we will neglect these considerations due to the restrictions of a spherically  symmetric evolution code , but return to them in  [ discuss ] .    in  [ properties ] we present the instability criterion for the mri , the resulting expressions for viscosity and diffusion coefficients that transport angular momentum and mix compositions , and our treatment of the growth and saturation of the magnetic field .",
    "section [ results ] describes our use of the mesa code and gives our results , and ",
    "[ discuss ] presents a discussion and conclusions .",
    "we first define a number of terms that will be employed in the subsequent discussion .",
    "the angular velocity is @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the radial shear .",
    "the alfvn frequency is @xmath4 . assuming the toroidal field to dominate , the alfvn frequency and alfvn velocity are : @xmath5 the terms @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the thermal and composition components of the brunt - visl frequency , @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the adiabatic and radiative gradients",
    ", @xmath12 is the pressure scale height , @xmath13 is the local gravity , @xmath14 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , t , and p are the local density , temperature and pressure , respectively .",
    "the thermal diffusivity is dominated by radiative transport , and is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the ratio of specific heats and @xmath20 is the radiative opacity .",
    "the magnetic resistivity , @xmath21 , is given by @xmath22 @xcite where @xmath23 is the coulomb logarithm @xmath24 after translating into cgs units .",
    "in the current work , we assume the thermal viscosity is negligible compared to @xmath25 and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the appropriate expressions for the instability criteria have terms that depend on radial and on lateral gradients .",
    "the latter can not be captured in a one  dimensional code like mesa , so we address only the spherical radial components of the instability criteria .      for the st instability , a minimum initial magnetic field is required for growth . in our calculations of the st dynamo process , we assume that this minimum field is present . in order for the overall st dynamo process to work , however , a significant shear is required to overcome the effects of both thermal and compositional buoyancy . following @xcite , the shear condition for the st process to operate",
    "may be expressed in our notation as @xmath26 where @xmath27 note that the sign of the shear is not important for the st dynamo .",
    "this is because the only effect of the shear in the st dynamo process is in winding up the poloidal field produced by the st instability , and the field winding process depends only on the magnitude of the shear , not its sign .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , we can write the local instability criterion for the mri in typical conditions in stars where the magnetic diffusivity @xmath21 is significantly smaller than the thermal diffusivity @xmath25 as @xmath28    in the absence of the brunt  visl terms in equation ( [ mricrit ] ) , the instability criterion for the mri is simply @xmath29 ; that is , the system is unstable when @xmath30 , _ i.e. _ , the angular velocity decreases outward .",
    "the component of the brunt  visl frequency associated with composition gradients , @xmath31 , is nearly always a stabilizing term in stars since the molecular weight almost always decreases monotonically outward .",
    "an exception arises in  [ 11 ] where we find a composition inversion with silicon overlying oxygen in the model with zams mass of 11 m@xmath1 .",
    "the thermal component of the brunt  visl frequency varies with the stellar structure . in convective regions ,",
    "@xmath32 is negative and the convective overturn promotes the mri . in radiative regions ,",
    "@xmath32 is positive and this term will then tend to oppose the mri instability .",
    "the thermal buoyancy term is , however , diminished by diffusive effects . for small  scale perturbations , perturbed fluid elements reach thermal equilibrium with the surroundings more quickly , thus reducing thermal buoyancy and the associated stabilizing influence .",
    "the magnetic diffusivity will tend to promote stability because the tendency to amplify the field will diminish .",
    "note that the latter is a very subtle effect , since that is the only indirect effect of the magnetic field .",
    "as long as the magnetic field is weak compared to the effects of rotation , @xmath33 , the instability criterion of equation ( [ mricrit ] ) does not depend on the strength of the magnetic field , one of the special properties of the mri @xcite .",
    "note that that the precise definition of the  reduced \" @xmath6 depends on the particular instability . in the derivation of the mri presented in @xcite , the term that we adopt in equation ( [ mricrit ] ) , @xmath34 , corresponds to the instability criterion for the diffusive small  scale mri .",
    "@xcite present other instability criteria for which the appropriate reduced value is different .",
    "although it is reasonable in the ambiance we explore in which @xmath35 , our expression would give unrealistically high estimates for the effects of buoyancy if @xmath36 , giving @xmath37 .    while the growth rate in the st mechanism depends on the field strength in a manner that leads to predictions of the ratio of the resulting radial and toroidal field (  [ bfields ] )",
    ", the mri is different in a fundamental way .",
    "if the field strength is below saturation , the growth rate of the mri depends only on the shear , not on the strength of the magnetic field . in regions unstable to the mri",
    ", the field should grow exponentially rapidly at the rate @xmath38 .",
    "the growth rate for the mri is likely to be much more rapid than that for the st instability if the initial conditions correspond to a weak magnetic field , @xmath33 .      in mesa ,",
    "all instabilities ( including st , eddington  sweet ( meridional circulation ) , goldrich  schubert",
    " fricke ) and the mri are treated as diffusive processes that diffuse angular momentum or species ( mixing ) .",
    "the net viscosity , @xmath39 , is assumed to be the linear sum of the viscous diffusion coefficients @xmath40 , corresponding to estimates of the diffusion coefficient for each individual process , @xmath41 . whether or not the diffusive effects associated with these various instabilities can truly be added in this simple linear way deserves deeper consideration , but that is beyond the scope of this work . following @xcite , the azimuthal stress , @xmath42 , generated by the field produced by either st or mri can be related to an effective magnetic viscosity , @xmath43 , by @xmath44 this viscosity is explicitly an  effective magnetic viscosity \" that is determined by the global magnetic structure of the star and very specifically is not in any way related to the microphysics of  molecular viscosity \" in the star .      for the st process",
    ", the magnetic field components are first constrained by various physical arguments .",
    "the resulting prescriptions for @xmath45 and @xmath46 are then incorporated in equation ( [ mag_stress ] ) to evaluate the effective viscosity @xcite .",

    "dimensionally , @xmath52 (  [ mrifields ] ) . assuming the toroidal field to dominate ,",
    "we can obtain a formal expression for the magnetic viscosity corresponding to the mri by substituting this expression into equation ( [ mag_stress ] ) @xmath53 where the absolute value sign is used to ensure that @xmath39 is positive .",
    "we have not defined precisely what we mean by @xmath45 and @xmath46 in this context .",
    "we return to this expression in  [ mrifields ] .    to estimate the viscosity corresponding to the mri , we have recourse to shearing  box simulations . in accretion disks ,",
    "the rotation is supersonic and the field produced by the mri is limited to be less than the value corresponding to equipartition with the local gas pressure , @xmath54 .",
    "because the components of the magnetic field are turbulent , temporal and spatial averaging of simulation data is needed to obtain an accurate estimate of field components and their products .",
    "the normalized total magnetic pressure in a simulation can be expressed as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the maximum magnetic pressure that can be produced by the mri at saturation .",
    "we adopt @xmath57 .",
    "if the radiation pressure , @xmath58 , is significant , this expression should be replaced with @xmath59 to produce the correct normalization @xcite . in the calculations here ,",
    "the gas pressure and degeneracy pressure typically exceed the radiation pressure by factors of at least several in the inner core .",
    "the addition of rotation and mixing tends to increase @xmath60 .",
    "we have neglected @xmath58 in our estimate of @xmath61 in the current work .",
    "we argue that the corresponding normalization in the subsonic shearing conditions relevant to stars is @xmath62 .",
    "we then assume that the appropriately normalized magnetic field components are the same in both accretion disks and in stars .    a stress efficiency parameter , @xmath61 ,",
    "can then be defined as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a suitable spatial and temporal average of the product of the field components . as just argued , the normalization is @xmath65 for an accretion disk and @xmath66 for stars .",
    "we assume that the normalized parameter @xmath61 is the same in both disks and stars .    in local shearing  box simulations ,",
    "the typical value of @xmath61 is in the range 0.01 to 0.05 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "global simulations may produce slightly larger values of @xmath61 , perhaps as large as 0.1 @xcite .",
    "we adopt @xmath67 as representative . using the right hand side of equation ( [ mag_stress ] ) and",
    "the definition of @xmath61 in the left hand side of equation ( [ alphadef ] ) yields an effective viscosity for the mri of @xmath68    we apply equation ( [ viscosity3 ] ) for all values of @xmath32 and @xmath69 without modification as long as the instability criterion ( [ mricrit ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the issue of how the mri works in semiconvective or thermohaline regions requires further work that is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the prescription for viscosity is not modified in semiconvective or thermohaline regions in the current work .",
    "we have considered other physical conditions and associated prescriptions for the effective viscosity of the mri .",
    "@xcite gives a prescription for the viscosity associated with the mri ( his equation 31 ) @xmath70 spruit notes that this viscosity may be relatively small , but that his conclusion is preliminary pending numerical simulations of the non  linear development .",
    "this prescription was based on the assumption that conditions are held very near those corresponding to the onset of the linear instability .",
    "it is not clear to us that the system under consideration will maintain this marginal condition .",
    "we have , rather , invoked estimates corresponding to something like saturation as revealed by simulations .",
    "we have , however , run one 15m@xmath1  model (  [ 15 ] ) with the prescription of equation ( [ viscositys99 ] ) and find that it can be comparable to , or even exceed the prescription we adopt in equation ( [ viscosity3 ] ) .",
    "another concern is that the instability criterion , equation ( [ mricrit ] ) , specifically invokes the destabilizing effect of thermal diffusion .",
    "the question arises as to whether or not the effectiveness of the mri in providing a viscosity is also limited by the constraint of significant thermal diffusion . since the growth time of the magnetic field is given by the shear , the maxwell stress is of order the reynolds stress , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are characteristic length scales in the radial and azimuthal directions and @xmath74 .",
    "if to maintain the growth of the mri , the length scales are restricted to be sufficiently small that thermal diffusion is active , then the effectve stress and associated viscosity might be also limited .",
    "suppose , for example , that @xmath75 ( or a pressure scale height ) , but that @xmath72 is restricted by the condition of effective thermal diffusivity .",
    "the latter could be expressed by writing @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the wavenumber of the maximally destabilized mode and @xmath78 is the brunt - visl frequency .",
    "the constraint on the length scale can thus be expressed as @xmath79 and the stress as @xmath80 .",
    "the associated viscosity would then be @xmath81 smaller than we adopted in equation ( [ viscosity3 ] ) by a factor of roughly @xmath82 .",
    "we have been somewhat loose in this discussion with the exact nature of the brunt - visl frequency , n. the relevant choice would seem to be the thermal component , @xmath6 , since this sets the relevant buoyancy timescale and , in the absence of thermal destablizing effects , dominates the composition term .",
    "conditions for which @xmath83 will be convective and the effective convective dynamic viscosity would then dominate other effects .",
    "we have adopted the prescription of equation ( [ viscositys14 ] ) in a model of a 15 m@xmath1star (  [ 15 ] ) in regions that are unstable to the mri and for which @xmath84 with no other magnetic effects .",
    "we find , as expected , that the viscous mixing and transport effects of the mri are rather small .",
    "given instability according to equation ( [ mricrit ] ) , the question becomes whether the prescription of equation ( [ viscosity3 ] ) or equation ( [ viscositys14 ] ) best describes the effective viscosity as the field grows toward saturation .",
    "in unstable conditions , there will be a most  rapidly growing mode of wave number , @xmath85 with a corresponding length scale @xmath86 neglecting factors of order unity .",
    "suppose the mri sets in with a small ambient field such that @xmath87 .",
    "the field will then grow until these two length scales are comparable , corresponding to a field strength of order @xmath88 it is not clear that this condition will suppress further field growth with this characteristic wave number , and even if it does , there will be perturbation due to mri turbulence that will be of larger wave number and smaller length scale that can continue to grow in an unstable environment , albeit at a slower rate .",
    "similar perspectives pertain even if the most rapidly - growing mode has a characterstic length larger than the thermal diffusive length scale even at the onset of instability . as long as some mode grows on a time scale that is short compared to the evolutionary times in the star",
    ", it seems that the field should continue to grow in strength , and that the only natural limit is that of saturation with @xmath89 .",
    "this is basically the condition that underlies equation ( [ viscosity3 ] ) .    in possibly analogous situations ,",
    "double  diffusive instabilities that might yield sufficient perturbations to provide a torque are rendered ineffective because of associated small scale turbulence that prevents effective radial coupling in the shear flow @xcite . even at saturation",
    ", this might affect the effective viscosity of the mri .",
    "for the reasons described here , we have presented results using equation ( [ viscosity3 ] ) for the mri viscosity based on extant numerical mri simulations but recognize that there are issues of physics here that require greater study .",
    "we now discuss the species mixing produced by each instability .",
    "the net diffusion coefficient for mixing , @xmath90 , is determined by linearly adding the diffusion coefficients @xmath91 corresponding to each process weighted by an efficiency factor @xmath92 which we discuss later in this section . for all of the hydrodynamic instabilities , @xmath93 . for the st mechanism ,",
    "the mixing is produced by the effective magnetic resistivity rather than the effective magnetic viscosity and again depends on the signs of @xmath32 and @xmath31 and the strength of thermal diffusion , @xmath25 .",
    "our prescriptions are identical to those in @xcite that have been incorporated in mesa . in radiative regions ,",
    "we apply the effective resistivity given by equations ( 41)-(43 ) of @xcite . in semiconvective regions ,",
    "we apply equations ( 6)-(9 ) of @xcite . in thermohaline regions ,",
    "we apply equation ( 43 ) of @xcite , which corresponds to his  case 1 \" .    in the rubric of the mri , the quantities @xmath94 and @xmath95 ,",
    "are expected to be about the same amplitude , at least under conditions of marginal stability @xcite .",
    "models of the turbulent mixing associated with the mri give a range of values of the ratio @xmath96 .",
    "the presence of an initial vertical magnetic field may decrease @xmath94 relative to @xmath95 @xcite , but the radial diffusion coefficient remains within a factor of three of @xmath39 @xcite . in the present work we thus take @xmath97 from equation [ viscosity3 ] in radiative , semiconvective , and thermohaline regions .",
    "we note that the model with zams mass of 11 m@xmath1  forms composition inversions that might trigger thermohaline instability , but we do not consider that in this paper .",
    "there are various efficiency factors related to the mixing process .",
    "following @xcite , in mesa @xmath98 is taken to be unity for convection and semi  convection and is taken to be a constant , @xmath99 , for the other processes .",
    "a second parameter , @xmath100 , is used to weight the @xmath14gradients in the individual terms .",
    "@xcite calibrated @xmath98 and @xmath101 by comparing observed surface abundances of nitrogen in lower mass , solar  type stars with model results based only on hydrodynamic instabilities . it is not completely clear that this calibration also applies to higher mass stars and when invoking magnetic instabilities , but this value has also been used in other studies invoking the st instability and comparison with surface nitrogen abundances in more massive stars @xcite . we adopt it for the st mechanism on the grounds of consistency with other , similar work .",
    "in contrast , there is direct evidence from mri simulations , as described above , that the mixing and diffusion coefficients are nearly equal . due to the small scale length of the most rapidly  growing mri modes , adding radial stratification that would be present in stars but",
    "is not present in those simulations might then make little difference to the results . given these considerations , the large range in @xmath94 , the large value of @xmath94 when the mri is active , and the intrinsic uncertainties in the formulation and implementation of the mixing of species , we set the condition @xmath102 , but adopt @xmath103 .",
    "we ran one of our fiducial models of zams mass of 15 m@xmath1  with @xmath104 , the coefficient adopted for the st mechanism .",
    "there were small quantitative but no qualitative differences compared to the model with @xmath102 .",
    "the most distinct difference was that the model with @xmath104 showed a more ragged composition distribution compared to the smoother distributions found with @xmath102 .",
    "the mixing and diffusion associated with the mri proceed on similar timescales of order @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are characteristic length and velocity scales for the mixing . for the mri ,",
    "the length scale of the mixing is plausibly less than the pressure scale height , @xmath108 and , because both st and the mri are magnetic effects , the characteristic velocity associated with either of them is likely to be restricted to @xmath109 . with these limits and with equation",
    "[ viscosity3 ] , equation [ mixing1 ] can be recast in the form @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the pressure scale height in units of @xmath112 cm and @xmath113 is the diffusion coefficient in units of @xmath114 @xmath115 s@xmath116 , a characteristic value when the mri is active .",
    "the mixing is thus potentially very rapid .",
    "the mesa time steps are of order 100 years at the end of core helium burning in the 15m@xmath1  model , so they are long compared to the diffusion timescale given in equation ( [ mixing2 ] ) .",
    "our treatment of mri mixing thus considers it to be  instantaneous \" in that phase , analogous to assuming  instantaneous \" mixing by convection in fully ",
    "efficient convective regions in a more traditional context . by the onset of core collapse in that model",
    ", the mesa time steps decline to be of order 1 second .",
    "the mri mixing might thus be resolved in that limit .",
    "the mixing may change the structure in a way that mutes the mixing by altering the gradient in angular velocity .",
    "this is a complex problem . in this work",
    "we have not attempted to specifically resolve the variations of the angular momentum per unit mass , the angular velocity and the composition profile on the short timescales indicated by equation ( [ mixing2 ] ) nor to determine how these functions vary as parameters are altered .",
    "rather we have chosen to show discrete intermediate stages and the final core mass and composition structure as integral measures of all these complex effects .",
    "we leave more detailed studies for future work .        in the range of length scales",
    "bounded below by magnetic diffusion and above by stratification , @xcite argued that the growth rate for the st mechanism is @xmath117 .",
    "the condition for field saturation for the st mechanism is that the growth rate is balanced by magnetic diffusion .",
    "because the growth rate depends on the field strength , prescriptions can be written for the toroidal and radial field strengths that depend on the rotation , the shear , the buoyancy terms , and the thermal diffusivity .",
    "@xcite gives prescriptions for the radial and toroidal fields corresponding to the st mechanism in the limits where the thermal diffusion can be ignored and where it dominates . in the former case ,",

    "they conclude that the st mechanism may be important for envelope angular momentum transport , but that some other process must be responsible for efficient spin - down of stellar cores .",
    "more recently , @xcite have noted that asteroseismology based on _ kepler _ observations suggests that the internal rotation rates of solar  type stars are too low to match the predictions of current rotating models , including the st mechanism .",
    "the mri is one candidate to contribute to this extra dissipation .",
    "another issue is that the predicted field structure for the st mechanism has a radial field that is weaker than the toroidal field by a factor of order @xmath165 . while one expects rotation about an axis and associated shear to produce predominantly toroidal field , this extreme ratio of toroidal to radial field",
    "is , to the best of our knowledge , unprecedented in numerical simulations . as an example",
    ", @xcite modeled the st process and found that the dynamo worked as predicted , but the resulting radial field ( cylindrical or spherical ) was of order 20% of the toroidal component ( whereas @xcite found an instability , but no dynamo ) . in conditions where the background varies sufficiently slowly , the equilibrium field structures found by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also mitchell et al .",
    "2014 ) may also be relevant . in those solutions characterized by a twisted torus and a poloidal component , the radial component is again a substantial fraction of the total field .",
    "understanding the radial component of the field is important because that is the component that determines the magnetic torque and hence the effective magnetic viscosity .",
    "clearly , the effective magnetic viscosity will be substantially larger if b@xmath166 is a substantial , not a tiny , fraction of b@xmath167 .",
    "related issues plague the proper treatment of the mri . in our current models",
    ", we have used prescriptions for the st and mri separately and together , but have not attempted to understand the fundamental , perhaps non  linear interaction of these instabilities . the st instability and",
    "the mri may occur in different regions of the star , the st instability near the rotation axis and the poles , the mri perhaps at lower latitudes . in regions where the two mechanisms may both operate ,",
    "the mri will be more rapid , but then enhance the field to the saturation limit where @xmath168 , at which point the stronger field will also enhance the effective viscosity of the st mechanism .",
    "we do not capture this sort of interaction in the current models .",
    "the full interplay of both of these instabilities with convection , semiconvection , thermohaline instabilities , radiation pressure other dynamo processes , and meriodional circulation in 3d is a complex one that will be a challenge to explore .",
    "we have invoked here the local instability criterion for the mri ( equation [ mricrit ] ) , but a proper analysis of the mri instability should be a global analysis as outlined by @xcite .",
    "global analyses can reveal that conditions that appear locally unstable to the mri are not , in fact , unstable , for instance because the unstable wavelength will not fit into the finite radial region of instability .    because it is very difficult to resolve the most rapidly  growing modes of the mri in core collapse , many mhd simulations invoke very strong initial fields , @xmath0 g , so that compression and wrapping effects mock up the final fields expected from the mri @xcite . if the pre  collapse seed fields are more modest , this is not a proper procedure since the mri is expected to grow fields exponentially rapidly on a post  collapse time scale , @xmath169 , much more rapid than the collapse and wrapping timescales . in this context it is interesting to note that our mri models lead to fields at the boundary of the iron core of @xmath0 g. these primarily toroidal fields may exist only in thin layers with a distribution very different than a dipole .",
    "the effect of such fields on magnetic core collapse is clearly of great interst .",
    "the effect of the mri on on the evolution preceeding core collapse may have implications for a host of issues related to neutron star formation , for instance the initial spins of pulsars and the mechanism of the formation of magnetars .",
    "our models suggest rather slowly rotating iron cores , which can not be ruled out .",
    "this is because of the very interesting possibility raised by @xcite and @xcite that collapse triggers the standing accretion shock instability , sasi , and that in 3d , the sasi can lead to fairly rapidly rotating neutron stars even in cases where the original iron core has very small or no angular momentum . if the proto  neutron star is spun up in this way , the mri may again be triggered as discussed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and others .",
    "the mri in concert with field compression and wrapping effects could provide the magnetic fields of pulsars .",
    "the rotation that can be induced by the sasi may not be enough yield a rossby number ( the ratio of convective overturn time to rotational period ) of order unity and hence a vigorous @xmath170 dynamo as invoked by @xcite to account for magnetar - level fields , but the mri may be able to do so under more modest spin conditions .",
    "the rotational profile at the time of core collapse is not the only important ingredient in the problem of determining the significance of the mri .",
    "if the mri does play a role in the final evolution of rotating stars , it is not sufficient to invoke it at the end of a calculation where steep gradients of angular velocity are already built up ; it must be applied from the beginning .",
    "the magnetic field developed in earlier phases may linger even after a given mass layer becomes stable to the mri ( or to st ) . if , in the prior evolution , there were a portion of the structure that triggered the mri , the field would rapidly grow to saturation . if the rotational structure then flattens to small q because of the effective magnetic viscosity , there might be a fossil rather large , mostly toroidal , field left behind .",
    "the latter might then affect the subsequent rotational evolution and the field in the progenitor at the time of collapse .",
    "if that were the case , then one needs to follow the whole evolution of the star , including fossil mri regions , to know the rotational and magnetic state at the time of collapse .",
    "a key question is then the time scale for magnetic field dissipation .",
    "if the field decays only through the processes of magnetic diffusivity , then the characteristic timescale can be written , using equation ( [ eta ] ) , as @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the temperature in units of @xmath173 k. this is a very long time and if this were the relevant physics , the fossil fields would be significant .",
    "if the field decays through reconnection , perhaps a more likely circumstance , then the time scale could be much shorter .",
    "the reconnection physics under the conditions of interest is not known , but we can make an estimate based on a simple model for resisitive reconnection @xcite @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the field strength in units of @xmath173 g. this implies that for the fiducial conditions chosen in equation ( [ reconn ] ) the timescale could be short and the fossil fields would decay quickly compared to an evolution time scale over most of the evolution",
    ". this may not be the case late in the evolution when the density is high , depending on the field strength .",
    "fossil fields might be important in the last several centuries of the life of a massive star , when other complications in the evolution such as burning on convective time scales are also likely to exist .",
    "an area of great impact is the quest to understand the role of stellar collapse in the formation of cosmic gamma - ray bursts .",
    "in particular , the results here suggest that slow rotation is the rule and hence that  collapsar \" models @xcite that require rather rapid rotation of a newly  formed black hole and its associated accretion disk could be problematical .",
    "as outlined above , there might be a route to form magnetars , with their potential role in the long , soft grb phenomenon , if the sasi generates original neutron star spin .",
    "even this possibility would raise a host of problems since not all collapse leads to magnetars and the rate of birth of grbs is substantially less than that estimated for magnetars . even if one contemplates a magnetar origin for grbs @xcite , the issue of what stars undergo that particular , small probability event is far from clear .",
    "the major challenge that we believe this work reveals is that the mri may have important effects on the evolution of stars and that to truly appreciate its effect , one - dimensional",
    " shellular \" calculations of stellar evolution may not be adequate .",
    "the mri , and other instabilities , are anisotropic and non  axisymmetric .",
    "they are likely to be triggered in complex patterns in the star and to engender complex flow distributions .",
    "if magnetoratational effects are active in the later stages of stellar evolution , then the overall sign of the effect seems clear : the interior of stars will rotate more slowly , perhaps much more slowly , than rotating stellar evolution calculations in the absence of magnetic effects would indicate .",
    "ironically , this might mean that legions of zero rotation or small rotation core - collapse calculations are more pertinent than one might have thought .",
    "we are grateful for discussions of the mri and related issues with steve balbus , henk spruit , and ethan vishniac and to the referee , kristin menou , for valuable feedback that improved the manuscript .",
    "we thank the mesa team for making this valuable tool readily available and especially thank bill paxton for his counsel in running the code .",
