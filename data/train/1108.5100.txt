    "the anomaly in energy spacings of the rotational spectra is still an actual subject for theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "a special attention is paid to the backbending phenomena observed in the moment of inertia dependency on the angular velocity squared .",
    "the sudden increase for the moment of inertia at intermediate and high spin is reflected in the energy spectra by a discontinuity of the monotonous increase in energy level spacings .",
    "backbending is a common phenomenon for many heavy and quadrupole deformed nuclei .",
    "since its discovery @xcite , there were many attempts to provide a theoretical interpretation for such an anomalous behavior of nuclear energy spectra . over the last decades studies showed that in general the backbending is a result of the crossing of the ground band ( _ g_-band ) with another rotational band with a larger moment of inertia @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of backbending is now well known , ( i.e. @xmath0 two neutron quasiparticle alignments ) .",
    "the nature of the second rotational band was , however , a question of a long standing debate , such that a few theoretical interpretations for the origin of this band came out @xcite : ( i ) the second band has a deformation which is larger than that characterizing the ground band .",
    "( ii ) the second band is not superfluid like the ground band but a rigid body one .",
    "( iii ) the second band is built upon a broken pair with aligned individual high angular momenta .",
    "the total angular momentum of the de - paired particles being itself aligned to the core angular momentum .",
    "the later two hypotheses were the most successful ones .",
    "the pioneering theoretical interpretation is based on the so - called coriolis anti pairing effect ( cap ) proposed by mottelson and valatin @xcite .",
    "indeed , the coriolis interaction violates the time reversal symmetry and consequently contributes essentially to the de - pairing process . as a result , a phase transition from a superfluid to an independent particle state characterized by normal fluid properties and therefore by a larger moment of inertia , takes place .",
    "cap is analogous to the meissner effect in metal superconductors @xcite .",
    "the coriolis force is proportional to the orbital angular momentum @xmath1 , which results in breaking first the pairs built on nucleons having largest @xmath1 with respect to the axis of rotation . breaking a pair leads to a dramatic increase of the moment of inertia @xcite due to the large decrease of the static gap which may even vanish . within a cranked mean - field approach ,",
    "the backbending phenomenon is caused by a rearrangement of the vacuum configuration or alternatively by the crossing of the ground - state band with the lowest two quasiparticle ( @xmath2 ) band which is often referred to as the @xmath3(tockholm ) band @xcite .",
    "information about several features like the crossing frequency , the yrast - yrare interaction and the alignment gain can be obtained from the diagram showing the @xmath4 routhians calculated at fixed deformation and for a constant pairing gap , versus the frequency @xcite .",
    "difficulties raised due to the semiclassical nature of the cranking approach and related with the angular momentum dispersion , @xmath5 were discussed by several authors ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "certainly a quantitative microscopic description of the moment of inertia in the crossing region encounters some difficulties caused by the symmetry breaking .",
    "thus the lipkin - nogami method @xcite for the gauge projection was used in ref.@xcite by satula and collaborators , while the galilean invariance @xcite has been restored in refs.@xcite . the spurious shape dependence met in treating the quadrupole - quadrupole ( @xmath6 )",
    "pairing interaction has been eliminated by using a double stretched @xmath6 pairing @xcite and an excellent quantitative description of the moment of inertia for the so called super - deformed bands of hg - pb nuclei was obtained .",
    "an alternative description of the pair breaking process @xcite was proposed by stephens and simon , pointing to a mechanism which causes a rotational alignment of the particles from intruder orbitals .",
    "other microscopic models reproducing qualitatively the zigzag shape of experimental plots of moment of inertia are those of sorensen @xcite and faessler @xcite .",
    "more recent attempts proposed approaches based on the interacting boson model @xcite .    in this study",
    "we present a new and simple semi - phenomenological model for backbending which here is considered to be the result of the band crossing mechanism between the ground band and a two quasiparticle decoupled band known as the _ s_-band .",
    "the first backbending is known to be caused by the breaking of a neutron pair from the intruder orbital @xmath0 , while the second one is due to a subsequent breaking of a proton @xmath7 pair .",
    "our model is meant to reproduce the low spin and intermediate spin states from the yrast band , such that the scope of this paper is to describe only the first backbending .",
    "the particles from the intruder orbitals where the pair breaking occurs are treated separately from the remaining ones which define the core .",
    "the phenomenological core is described by the coherent state model @xcite , while the motion of the intruder particles is treated through bcs model states .",
    "a special ingredient of our formalism is that we consider here a deformed core which induces also deformed trajectories for the intruder particles .",
    "the rotational bands implied in the hybridization procedure are defined by angular momentum projection from quadrupole deformed product states , which achieves the coupling of the single - particle degrees of freedom to a quadrupole deformed core and provides states with good angular momentum .",
    "the basis states are deformed and non - orthogonal . from this basis",
    "an orthogonal basis is obtained which is further used to diagonalize the model hamiltonian .",
    "the yrast energies are defined by the lowest eigenvalues of the model hamiltonian in the orthogonal basis .",
    "this formalism was applied to six even - even nuclei from the rare earth region with @xmath8 , which exhibit backbending behavior in their moment of inertia plots .",
    "the numerical applications reproduce quite well the experimental data and also provide some useful information regarding the rotational alignment of particles moving in the intruder orbitals .",
    "results are presented according to the following plan . in the next section",
    "we describe the projected nonorthogonal basis states from which emerges the orthogonal basis .",
    "the model hamiltonian is introduced in sec.iii where some of its single - particle and collective features are discussed .",
    "the matrix elements of the model hamiltonian in the non - orthogonal basis are analytically given .",
    "section iv is devoted to deriving the final orthogonal basis and to the band hybridization procedure .",
    "numerical results are analyzed in sec .",
    "v. conclusions and the future perspectives of the model are discussed in section vi .",
    "as we have already mentioned a particle - core interacting hamiltonian will be treated in a space of spherical projected particle - core states .",
    "we start by giving the necessary details for the projection procedure and therefore about the model states .",
    "the collective factor state is a coherent state for the quadrupole bosons @xmath9 , while the single - particle component is a deformed bcs state describing a set of paired nucleons which are moving in a deformed mean - field @xcite : @xmath10 in the above equation , @xmath11 stands for the boson vacuum state , and @xmath12 is a real parameter which simulates the nuclear deformation .",
    "the low index of the bcs state suggests that this is deformed .",
    "the projected states are obtained , in the usual manner , by acting on the state ( 2.1 ) with the hill - wheeler projection operator @xmath13 in what follows , we shall present the angular momentum projection procedure for each factor state from ( 2.1 ) .",
    "the projection of the quadrupole coherent state was presented by one of the authors ( a. a. raduta ) , in collaboration , in ref.@xcite .",
    "the main results are as follows : @xmath14 the matrix elements of any boson hamiltonian between these projected states can be analytically expressed in terms of the norms : @xmath15 where @xmath16 stands for the overlap integrals @xmath17^{k}e^{xp_{2}(y)}dy,\\,\\,\\textrm{with}\\,\\,x = d^{2},\\ ] ] and @xmath18 denotes the legendre polynomial of the rank @xmath19 .",
    "these integrals have been analytically calculated in ref.@xcite .",
    "the projection procedure adopted in this paper for the deformed bcs state is that formulated by kelemen and dreizler in ref.@xcite .",
    "thus , the fermionic function @xmath20 is expressed first as a linear combination of states with a definite angular momentum @xmath21 and then the projection operator selects only the component of the desired angular momentum : @xmath22 the projected function is normalized to unity , and consequently we have : @xmath23 in this way the amplitude @xmath24 can be expressed as @xmath25 the calculation of @xmath24 is very much simplified if the projection operator @xmath26 is expressed as a finite sum of particular rotation operators @xcite : @xmath27,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is even and @xmath28 . on the other hand the terms @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be also analytically calculated .",
    "their expressions are given in appendix a.    the calculation of the amplitudes @xmath24 is thus reduced to finding the matrix element @xmath31 . for this purpose ,",
    "the fermionic wave function is written as a sum of components with determined the number of particle pairs : @xmath32 where @xmath33 are states with @xmath34 pairs of particles and @xmath35 are defining the bogoliubov - valatin ( bv ) transformation from the particle to the quasiparticle representation .",
    "it can be shown that the matrix element of the rotation operator @xmath36 on states @xmath33 can be expressed in the form of a determinant of rank @xmath37 of reduced wigner functions @xmath38 with the argument : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the maximum angular momentum realized by the set of @xmath34 pairs of particles .",
    "for illustration we will present here only the case for two pairs : @xmath41 the largest angular momentum @xmath40 in the configuration @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the angular momentum of the individual particles , is not necessary @xmath44 because of the pauli principle constraint .",
    "group theory provides a simple formula for the upper limit of the total angular momentum of a given configuration , which moreover takes care of the pauli principle @xcite : @xmath45 in table i the largest angular momenta achieved for all possible numbers of neutron pairs in the intruder orbital @xmath0 , are listed .",

    "of course , the @xmath3 band associated to the @xmath2 projected state @xmath50 is the first one which intersects the @xmath51 band and will become the yrast after intersection . _",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath49 listed in table iii are consistent with the nilsson model prediction for the last filled orbital of the chosen nuclei having the quadrupole nuclear deformation @xmath52 given in table ii . _",
    "our calculations show that the @xmath53 component has a squared weight of about 45%-64% in the bcs composition . as a matter of fact",
    ", this suggests that the approximation ( 5.1 ) made for the _ g_-band energies is to be corrected due to the nonvanishing angular momentum components of the bcs state .",
    "in fact since the @xmath53 component is only moderately dominant in the bcs state composition , the effective angular momentum of fermions is not vanishing in the @xmath51 band and not 12 for the states belonging to the @xmath3 band .",
    "this feature is conspicuous from the analysis of fig .",
    "the matrix elements between states ( 2.18 ) of the spin - spin interaction term have a very peculiar feature .",
    "their numerical values increase with the total angular momentum , going from negative values to positive ones .",
    "the transition from negative to positive values takes place at @xmath54 , where , in most cases , the backbending shows up .",
    "in this situation the parameter @xmath55 does not affect the position of the band crossing point .",
    "however , it influences the magnitude of the yrast energies in the high spin region . due to this feature @xmath55",
    "is fixed as to reproduce the moderate high spin energies of the yrast band .",
    "the fitted parameters of the model hamiltonian are collected in table ii .",
    "we remark that the factor @xmath56 which , according to eq.(3.9 ) , plays the role of the deformed mean - field strength , has roughly a linear dependence on the quadrupole nuclear deformation @xmath52 .",
    "this dependence is illustrated in fig.2 .",

    "@xmath19 we select the lowest eigenvalues @xmath57 .",
    "the set of energies @xmath58 defines the yrast band .",
    "the discrete derivatives of the resulting energies with respect to the angular momentum defines the angular frequency : @xmath59.\\ ] ] alternatively , the angular velocity can be also defined by using for @xmath57 the expression provided by a symmetric rotor hamiltonian : @xmath60 then the discrete derivative of this expression yields : @xmath61 from here one derives a simple expression for the moment of inertia : @xmath62 the backbending plot is a graph in which the moment of inertia is plotted versus @xmath63 .",
    "theoretical results and experimental data are usually compared in terms of this plot .",
    "this is done in fig.3 for the even - even rare earth nuclei treated here .",
    "note that in all cases the zigzag behavior is reproduced quite well .",
    "in general , a good agreement between theoretical and experimental data corresponding to low - spin states and moderately high spin states located however below the possible second backbending is obtained .",
    "the second backbending is known to be caused by the consecutive breaking of a neutron @xmath0 pair and a proton pair from the shell @xmath7 .",
    "the second backbending seems to be a rare event . despite this some of the considered nuclei exhibit such a phenomenon",
    "indeed , @xmath64yb has a second backbending which occurs at @xmath19=26 , while for @xmath65er the second backbending shows up in the same region but is less evident being rather an up - bending . in both mentioned cases our calculations show an up - bending around the j=26 state .",
    "the study of the second backbending is however beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the crossing of the @xmath51 and the @xmath3 bands is illustrated in fig.4 , where their energies are plotted as a function of @xmath66 .",
    "we also give the results for the two unperturbed bands whose energies are approximated as the diagonal matrix elements of the system s hamiltonian in the nonorthogonal basis . in each panel",
    "the @xmath67 values for the deviation of the theoretical results from the corresponding experimental data are given .",
    "as can be seen from fig.4 , while the _ s_-band energies exhibit a linear dependence on @xmath66 for the _ g _ band a slight quadratic dependence on @xmath66 is met .",

    "the @xmath67 values corresponding only to the states taken in consideration here , i.e. up to @xmath71 , are given.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    in order to investigate the alignment of the individual angular momenta to the angular momentum of the core we define the average angular momenta for the interacting components as follows : @xmath72 the full alignment corresponds to the situation when @xmath73 equates the total angular momentum of the system @xmath19 .",
    "the departure from this ideal picture is measured by the deviation : @xmath74 this quantity together with the average angular momenta of the core @xmath75 and fermion system @xmath76 are plotted versus the total angular momentum @xmath19 , in fig .",
    "these plots reveal several features , such as the band crossing point , the amount of angular momentum carried by the broken pair or even the fraction of the angular momenta alignment .",
    "for example for er isotopes and @xmath47hf the band crossing takes place at @xmath77 , while for @xmath78hf and @xmath64yb at @xmath79 and for @xmath68dy at @xmath80 .",
    "this is actually a confirmation of the backbending results from fig.3 .",
    "the amount of angular momentum , @xmath76 , carried by the broken pair varies from 10@xmath81 to 14@xmath81 .",
    "we remark that at the band crossing the alignment defect is maximal and this is decreasing by increasing @xmath19 .",
    "the full alignment is never reached but the defect @xmath82 exhibits a plateau with the value of 2@xmath81 - 3@xmath81 , beyond @xmath83 .",
    "this is a salient feature for the present formalism which is not met in other approaches where @xmath84 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath64yb the variation of @xmath85 around crossing is only 2@xmath81 and , moreover , after band crossing the core and fermionic angular momenta are almost equal to each other . for all other nuclei , at the crossing @xmath19",
    "the core angular momentum variation is about 4@xmath81 .",
    "we do nt have any situation where after crossing @xmath86 .",
    "therefore for a critical value of angular momentum of the core the spin - spin interaction causes the de - pairing of two neutrons , which almost align their angular momenta and starting from a larger total spin ( @xmath87 ) the fermion total angular momentum is almost aligned to the core angular momentum , @xmath88 . in general , the second alignment is produced for @xmath89 .",

    "rotational energy of the _ g_-band and of the @xmath2 band from a certain spin increases monotonously .",
    "experimental data points are also visualized.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    figure 6 shows the calculated rotational energies and the experimental data of _ g_-band and _ s_-band versus angular momentum for @xmath47hf .",
    "we present this case separately since here the best agreement of theoretical results and the corresponding data was obtained in the backbending region , after the crossing point .",
    "the slope of the curves from this figure is the angular velocity @xmath90 .",
    "note that up to a critical spin the rotational energies of the @xmath2 band have a negative slope then this is vanishing and further is increasing . finally it reaches a constant value which reflects an equidistant structure for the spectrum in this region .",
    "the later situation shows up when a maximal alignment is achieved .",
    "the negative slope corresponds to the situation when the fermion and the core angular momenta make an angle varying from @xmath91 to @xmath92 . at the beginning of the interval",
    "the individual angular momenta are almost anti - aligned and their sum is also almost antialigned to the core angular momenta . when the individual angular momenta are partially antialigned , the two frequencies caused by particles and core respectively , add destructively .",
    "increasing @xmath19 the two frequencies have the same sign and therefore add each other , constructively . in this part of the curve , the second alignment namely that of the total fermionic and the core angular momenta , starts operating .",
    "when a maximal alignment is achieved the slope keeps constant and consequently the two curves become almost parallel .",
    "as shown in fig.5 , the properties described before , seem to be generally valid .",
    "a similar angular momentum dependency was obtained also in refs.@xcite .",
    "the mechanism of breaking the pairs and aligning the individual angular momenta to the core angular momentum is suggested in fig.7 .",
    "indeed , for low values of the core angular momentum the nucleon angular momenta are aligned to the symmetry axis of the mean - field which , as a matter of fact , is determined by the @xmath93 coupling term .",
    "this situation is shown in fig.7 a ) where @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the mechanism suggested in fig.7 is consistent with the following phenomenological picture .",
    "the core angular momentum is perpendicular to the symmetry axis oz . let us consider that ox is the direction of @xmath96 .",
    "averaging @xmath97 with the wigner functions @xmath98 with @xmath40 and @xmath99 being eigenvalues of @xmath100 , one obtains an operator acting in the intrinsic frame which breaks the time reversal symmetry . due to this property",
    "this is the term responsible for the neutron pair breaking connecting the states of @xmath101 and @xmath2 types , respectively . in the intrinsic frame the mentioned term",
    "connects a state with all particles paired , ( i.e. with total @xmath99 equal to zero ) with a state where a @xmath102 pair is replaced by a @xmath103 broken pair .",
    "actually , the same effect is obtained within microscopic models using for a many - body system with pairing interaction a cranking term of the type @xmath104 .",
    "it is worth mentioning the following specific features of the present model . the total quantum number @xmath99 is obtained by summing the contributions from nucleons and the core",
    ". however , writing the projected state of the core [ 25 ] in the intrinsic frame , one obtains an expression which is a superposition of components of different @xmath99 . among these , the major component corresponds to @xmath102 . in this respect",
    "the broken pair state is not a pure @xmath103 state but , due to the core , a superposition of various @xmath105 components .",
    "however the major component is the one characterized by @xmath103 .    at this stage",
    "it is worth making clear the way the spin - spin interaction simulates the action of the coriolis force in the intrinsic reference frame . indeed , up to a diagonal term the interaction @xmath97 can be written in the following form : @xmath106 with @xmath19 denoting the total angular momentum . since the core projected state is a superposition of components where the core function factor is a wigner function of even values for @xmath99 ,",
    "the projected state characterizing the whole system is a superposition of components having a wigner function with odd @xmath99 as one of the factor states",
    ". the action of the raising or lowering operator on @xmath107 will transform it to @xmath108 or @xmath109 with an even projection of @xmath110 on the symmetry axis .",
    "the factor states associated with quasiparticles will be transformed from a @xmath103 state either to a @xmath102 state or to a @xmath111 state .",
    "concluding , in the intrinsic frame the coriolis term connects the @xmath103 2@xmath4 states with the @xmath102 2@xmath4 states . in the case of the odd particle - core system with one particle out of the core , the matrix element of the coriolis interaction is different from zero only for the states with @xmath112 .",
    "the interaction is attractive or repulsive depending on whether @xmath113 is even or odd .",
    "note that , by contrast , here a set of even numbers of nucleons is moving outside a phenomenological core and , moreover , the coriolis interaction is effective in any @xmath99 state . in the laboratory frame",
    "the spin - spin interaction affects mainly the @xmath2 states , as is shown in fig.[fig.9 ] .",
    "it is worth noticing that the interaction is attractive in the @xmath2 band states having an angular momentum smaller than the crossing point and repulsive in other states of the @xmath3 band .",
    "therefore , the spin - spin interaction causes an attenuation effect on the moment of inertia in the @xmath3 band , after crossing the @xmath51 band .",
    "if we switch off the spin - spin interaction , the slope of the curves from fig.4 , representing the energy versus @xmath66 , is decreased after the two bands crossing point , which results in enlarging the moment of inertia of the @xmath3 band . due to this feature",
    "the bending in the moment of inertia plot is more pronounced than the bending taking place in the presence of the spin - spin interaction .",
    "the alignment of the particle angular momenta to the core angular momenta is shown in fig.7 b ) .",
    "the fact that the total @xmath99 for the two neutrons is equal to unity prevents a full alignment .",
    "the larger @xmath114 the larger the effect of the spin - spin interaction term .",
    "this infers that the backbending occurs when the broken pair is from a large spin single - particle state .",
    "for this reason the most favorable candidates for decoupling are particles from intruder orbitals like @xmath0 for neutrons and @xmath7 for protons .",
    "we stress on the fact that breaking a pair means to break the time reversal symmetry of the system , ( i.e. , to promote a paired particle to a state of different @xmath49 which results in having a pair with a total @xmath99 different from zero ) .",
    "such an operation can not be performed by the @xmath93 interaction [ see eq.(3.15 ) ] since the quasiparticle factor has only two quasiparticle @xmath102 terms .",
    "therefore in the present formalism the only term responsible for pair breaking is the spin - spin interaction .",
    "angular momentum and a general @xmath115 projection .",
    "the angular momentum of the particles is then coupled to that of the prolate core which is perpendicular to the symmetry axis ( @xmath116 ) , resulting in the total angular momentum @xmath110.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]            equations ( 5.7 ) and ( 5.8 ) can be used for calculating the gyromagnetic factor for an yrast state of angular momentum @xmath19 .",
    "indeed , from the expression of the magnetic moment @xmath117 one easily derive the following expression for @xmath118 : @xmath119,\\ ] ] where @xmath120 and @xmath121 denote the gyromagnetic factor of the core and fermionic system . for the core",
    "we consider @xmath122 with @xmath123 and @xmath124 denoting the charge and atomic number characterizing the core .",
    "taking into account that the intruder state is @xmath0 and this is occupied by neutrons , the corresponding gyromagnetic factor is : @xmath125 with @xmath126 being the nuclear magneton and @xmath127 the gyromagnetic factor for the neutron spin . the gyromagnetic factor plotted in fig.9 as a function of @xmath19 , reflects the nature of the yrast states .",
    "indeed , before the intersection of the @xmath101 and @xmath2 bands , @xmath118 is independent of @xmath19 and very close to the rotational value @xmath128 .",
    "when the intersection of the two bands takes place , @xmath118 has a big jump to a negative value , which confirms the @xmath2 character of the band which follows .",
    "this feature persists only for a few states and then the core contribution starts to be dominant which results in having a positive value for @xmath118 .",
    "the curve allure suggests a quadratic @xmath19 dependence for @xmath118 . except for @xmath64yb ,",
    "the curve has two branches , one constant corresponding to the @xmath51 band and one quadratically increasing with @xmath19 , which corresponds to the @xmath3 band . in the case of @xmath64yb , after the crossing point , the curve decreases a little and then starts increasing .",
    "note that because the magnetic moment carried by the core and fermions have opposite orientations and moreover the core contribution is an increasing function of @xmath19 , there is a critical value of @xmath19 where the total magnetic moment and therefore the gyromagnetic factor are vanishing .",
    "for the maximum angular momentum considered here , the gyromagnetic factor reaches half of the rotational value , i.e. about 0.2 @xmath126 .    before closing this section",
    "we would like to spend a few lines on comparing our approach with two other formalisms . at a superficial glance",
    "one may think that the formalism presented here is similar to that of refs.@xcite .",
    "therefore a fair comparison of the two procedures is necessary .",
    "first we mention that the mean - field determining the single - particle basis is deformed while that used in refs.@xcite is spherical .",
    "therefore , an angular momentum projection operation for the deformed bcs states is necessary in our case . in the quoted reference ,",
    "the coherent state is defined in terms of deformed quadrupole bosons which makes difficult the evaluation of the overlap matrix elements .",
    "indeed , the matrix elements between rotated intrinsic states are approximated and then parametrized . by contrast , the coherent state used here corresponds to spherical quadrupole bosons and moreover the matrix elements are analytically calculated . here",
    "the pairing interaction is effective for nucleons moving outside the phenomenological core , while in ref .",
    "@xcite only the pairs from the core and those from outside the core interact with each other .",
    "moreover , the pairing interaction is treated in the particle representation which in fact leads to a parametrization of the corresponding matrix elements .",
    "consequently , the hamiltonian is diagonalized in a basis with a fixed number of particles .",
    "since a bcs formalism for the deformed single - particle states is used , in the present case , the number of particles is conserved only in average .",
    "the numbers of the parameters employed by the two formalisms are also different : seven for ref.@xcite and five in the present approach .",
    "one may conclude that although the two approaches have some common features , they are essentially different . a similar single - particle basis is used in ref.@xcite but in a different context .",
    "indeed , using a particle - rotor formalism the dependence of the interaction of the lowest two bands on the degree of filling the shell is studied pointing out an oscillating behavior .",
    "in the previous sections a semiphenomenological formalism for the description of the backbending phenomenon was proposed .",
    "a model hamiltonian associated with a set of interacting particles moving in a deformed mean - field coupled to a phenomenological core described in terms of quadrupole boson operators is treated in a product space of angular momentum projected states .",
    "the pairing interaction of neutrons moving in a deformed mean - field is treated by the bcs formalism .",
    "the model states for the ground - state band are obtained by angular momentum projection of the deformed product state @xmath129 , while the @xmath3 band states are projected out from the intrinsic @xmath103 two quasiparticle states @xmath130 .",
    "the substate @xmath131 is chosen such that the corresponding quasiparticle energy is minimum .",
    "projected states of @xmath51 and @xmath3 bands are not mutually orthogonal . diagonalizing the overlap matrix , one defines an orthogonal basis for treating the model hamiltonian .",
    "the parameters involved were fixed by a fitting procedure described in the previous section .",
    "the lowest hamiltonian eigenvalues in the orthogonal basis defines the yrast band .",
    "the first energy levels originate from the projected states of the @xmath101 state mentioned above while , starting from a critical angular momentum they are mainly of a @xmath2 nature .",
    "the experimental backbending shape of the moment of inertia versus angular frequency squared is fairly well reproduced by our results .",
    "the data considered in our calculations refer to energy levels with angular momentum up to 26 - 28 .",
    "a measure of the agreement quality is the @xmath67 value characterizing the deviations of the calculated energies from the corresponding experimental data .",
    "this quantity is about 30kev or less .",
    "a detailed analysis of the effect coming from the @xmath97 term concerning the neutron pair breaking as well as the alignment of individual angular momentum to the core angular momentum , is presented .",
    "the pair breaking takes place for @xmath54 and the maximum alignment is settled for @xmath19 larger than 20 . since the de - paired neutrons carry a projection @xmath103 , a full alignment is not possible .",
    "as shown in fig.5 for @xmath132 the angular momentum defect @xmath82 reaches a plateau with @xmath133",
    ". also observed is an abrupt change of the gyromagnetic factor from positive to negative values in the band crossing region , which is consistent with the change in structure of the yrast band , going from rotational to @xmath2 character .",
    "we may conclude that the present formalism is able to account quantitatively for the main features of the backbending phenomenon in the rare earth nuclei .",
    "although effects like pair breaking , bands crossing and angular momentum alignment have been explained , within some cranking formalisms , by several authors , the present approach provides a consistent description for the mentioned effects pointing out several interesting features which will be enumerated below .    *",
    "although we use a spherical projected particle - core basis the two components , particles and core , are deformed . working with states of good angular momenta is an advantage over the cranking methods where the states in the crossing region exhibit a large dispersion for angular momentum . *",
    "the effects of the @xmath93 and @xmath134 terms on the backbending are discussed and specific contributions are identified .",
    "*   it is shown that the spin - spin interaction simulates in the laboratory frame the coriolis force which is active in the intrinsic frame .",
    "* by the bands crossing the core angular momentum , @xmath135 , varies only by a few units , @xmath136 .",
    "the minimal variation is of @xmath137 and is recorded for @xmath64yb . due to this feature one expects a nonvanishing @xmath138 transition between the states lying in the vicinity of the crossing point .",
    "* we depicted one case , @xmath64yb , where after the bands crossing point , the angular momenta carried by fermions and the core are close to each other . *",
    "( 6.)the curves associated with @xmath135 and @xmath139 , in fig.5 , cross each other at a total angular momentum equal to 22 for @xmath68dy , @xmath65er , 24 for @xmath64yb , @xmath64er and 26 for @xmath70hf . *",
    "the maximum alignment is reached in the region of @xmath89 , where the defect @xmath82 is equal to @xmath140 .",
    "this is a reflection of the @xmath103 nature for the @xmath3 band .    due to the above - mentioned aspects",
    "one may say that although the present paper addresses a relatively old subject the proposed formalism unveils alternative features of the backbending phenomenon .    before closing",
    ", we present a few perspectives of the present approach . indeed",
    ", the results encourage us to extend the restricted model space by adding to the particle factor the proton state @xmath7 which is suspected to be responsible for the second backbending .",
    "another possible extension refers to the collective factor states , by adding to the coherent state considered here the model states for beta and gamma bands used by the coherent state model .",
    "it is well known that the energy spectra of these bands comprise more irregularities than the ground state band .",
    "it is an open question whether such anomalies could be also interpreted as the interaction with other bands of a different nature . in this way",
    "we could describe a multibackbending phenomenon showing up in the yrast and non - yrast bands .",

    "the state obtained by applying a pair of time reversed quasiparticle operators on a bcs function can be written as a linear combination of states with a definite angular momentum @xmath19 , with @xmath19 running from 0 to 24 , and a projection on @xmath148 axis @xmath102 : @xmath149 acting with an angular momentum projection operator on this state is equivalent to selection of only one @xmath19 component from the above linear combination , and rotating the projection to the value @xmath40 : @xmath150 the angular momentum states @xmath151 are orthogonal and normalized to unity",
    ". then the norm of this projected function is the reciprocal of the amplitude @xmath152 : @xmath153    now if we apply on the state ( b.1 ) a raising angular momentum operator , @xmath154 and then project an angular momentum from the resulting function , one obtains exactly the @xmath103 @xmath2 projected fermionic function : @xmath155 whose normalization factor is readily obtained : @xmath156    making use of eqs .",
    "( b.5 ) and ( b.6 ) , one can also derive the expressions for other m.e . which we need in our calculations .",

    "the desired matrix elements are easily obtained by applying a canonical transformation to the particle operators : @xmath161 where @xmath162 and @xmath163 are the occupation parameters from the bcs equations .",
