    ", the number of particles becomes too large @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the collapse can be induced experimentally by tuning the scattering length in the vicinity of feshbach resonances by adjusting an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the critical parameter values where collapse occurs correspond to solutions to the stationary gross - pitaevskii equation , where the stable ground state and an unstable excited state emerge in a tangent bifurcation @xcite .",
    "the coalescence of two or even more eigenstates at critical points in the parameter space , where both the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the states pass through a branch point singularity and become identical , is a characteristic property of an `` exceptional point '' @xcite .",
    "exceptional points can not occur in quantum systems described by the linear schrdinger equation with hermitian operators .",
    "however , they can appear in systems described by non - hermitian matrices or in nonlinear systems which depend on a multidimensional parameter space .",
    "examples are discussed , e.g. , for complex atoms in laser fields @xcite , a double @xmath0 well @xcite , the scattering of a beam of particles by a double barrier potential @xcite , non - hermitian bose - hubbard models @xcite , or models used in nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "the resonant behavior of atom waves in optical lattices @xcite also shows structures originating from exceptional points .",
    "however , the phenomenon of exceptional points in physics is not restricted to quantum mechanics .",
    "acoustic modes in absorptive media @xcite represent a mechanical system in which branch - point singularities appear .",
    "furthermore , manifestations of exceptional points can be seen in optical devices @xcite .",
    "the most detailed experimental analysis of exceptional points has been carried out for the resonances of microwave cavities @xcite , which open the possibility of studying the properties of the complex resonance frequencies and the wave functions .",
    "critical phenomena also occur in nonlinear systems .",
    "various types of bifurcations which are classified in catastrophe theory @xcite are branch point singularities and resemble exceptional points in many aspects .",
    "bose - einstein condensates are described in a mean - field approach by the nonlinear gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "the stationary solutions of this equation exhibit a coalescence of two states due to the nonlinearity of the equation , which turns out to be a branch - point singularity of the energy eigenvalues and wave functions @xcite .",
    "there is only one linearly independent eigenvector of the coalescing states at the exceptional point .",
    "these systems exhibit the typical consequences of exceptional points , viz .",
    "the permutation of eigenstates when an exceptional point is encircled in the parameter space and a special type of geometric phase .    for condensates with an attractive gravity - like @xmath1 interaction @xcite and for dipolar condensates @xcite the bifurcation points of the ground and excited state have been analyzed in theoretical computations to verify that they show signatures of exceptional points .",
    "to that aim the stationary states of the nonlinear system can be approximated by a linear matrix model with a non - hermitian matrix .",
    "however , the dynamics can not be described by a linear model because the superposition principle is not valid in nonlinear systems , i.e. , there is no unitary time evolution of the condensate wave function .",
    "the stability properties of bose - einstein condensates are determined by the eigenvalues of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations which are obtained by linearization of the gross - pitaevskii equation around the stationary states .",
    "the existence of complex frequencies in the bogoliubov spectrum indicates a dynamical instability of the condensate @xcite .",
    "typically a stable and an unstable state are created in a tangent bifurcation , and a state changes its stability properties when running through an exceptional point at a pitchfork bifurcation . however , there are counterexamples where the occurrence of an exceptional point and the stability change do not match .",
    "a discrepancy between the occurrence of a pitchfork bifurcation and the stability change has been observed in @xmath2-symmetric states of a condensate where atoms are incoupled to one side and extracted from the other @xcite .",
    "an important property of exceptional points , which follows from the branch point singularity structure , is the permutation of the eigenvalues if the exceptional point is encircled in the parameter space @xcite . using an analytic continuation of the gross - pitaevskii equation",
    "the bifurcation points in bose - einstein condensates can be encircled in the complex plane of the scattering length .",
    "indeed , after one circle around the critical point a permutation of the two states is present clearly indicating the existence of an exceptional point @xcite .",
    "however , complex scattering lengths within the analytically continued gross - pitaevskii equation are not experimentally accessible , and thus the method mentioned above can not be used for an experimental verification of exceptional points in bose - einstein condensates .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present an alternative method for the verification of the exceptional points .",
    "it is based on dynamical properties of the condensates and can also be applied in an experiment .",
    "while the investigations of exceptional points mentioned above are related to non - hermitian time - independent hamiltonians effects of exceptional points also occur in time - dependent systems @xcite .",
    "uzdin et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that a sharp transition from an oscillatory to a monotonic exponential dynamics occurs in the time evolution of a single particle in a harmonic trap with a certain time - dependent frequency @xmath3 , and that this transition corresponds to an exceptional point .",
    "the time evolution of the particle can be analyzed with the harmonic inversion method as shown in @xcite . here",
    "an exceptional point is characterized by the degeneracy of two or more frequencies in the frequency spectrum of the time signal .",
    "the dynamics of a bose - einstein condensate described by the nonlinear time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation differs fundamentally from the dynamics of a linear quantum system .",
    "nonetheless , we will show that the existence of exceptional points can be verified in the dynamics of the condensate when the harmonic inversion analysis is applied to a restricted region of the time evolution . starting with a condensate in the stable region of the parameter space the scattering length",
