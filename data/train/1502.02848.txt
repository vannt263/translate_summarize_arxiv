    "perhaps some kind of a dynamical model , though definitely difficult to construct , might reproduce the volume decrease . hence , an answer to the question whether transition is of displacive or order - disorder type lies in the dynamics of phase transition and the role of soft modes , as has been recently shown by the dft and phonon calculations @xcite .",

    "<S> the recent surge of interest in phase change materials gete , ge@xmath0sb@xmath0te@xmath1 , and related compounds motivated us to revisit the structural phase transition in gete in more details than was done before . </S>",
    "<S> rhombohedral - to - cubic ferroelectric phase transition in gete has been studied by high resolution neutron powder diffraction on a spallation neutron source . </S>",
    "<S> we determined the temperature dependence of the structural parameters in a wide temperature range extending from 309 to 973 k. results of our studies clearly show an anomalous volume contraction of 0.6% at the phase transition from the rhombohedral to cubic phase . in order to better understand the phase transition and the associated anomalous volume decrease in gete we have performed phonon calculations based on the density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> results of the present investigations are also discussed with respect to the experimental data obtained for single crystals of gete . </S>"
