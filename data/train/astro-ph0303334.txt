    "the leading model for long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and hypernovae assumes that they are driven by energy released from a disk accreting onto a black hole resulting from a massive stellar collapse .",
    "this accretion energy is converted to the explosion energy in the grb / hypernova jet either through some magnetic field mechanism or through the annihilation of neutrinos emitted by the hot disk . in this paper , we study the physics behind the neutrino driven explosion mechanism , deriving critical densities at which an explosion is launched . for long - duration ( @xmath0 ) grbs and all hypernovae ,",

    ", we can estimate the delay between stellar collapse and the launch of the jet as well as the ultimate black hole remnant mass .",
    "future observations of these delays and remnant masses provide constraints on the progenitor and/or jet mechanism for gamma - ray bursts .",
    "neutrinos emitted from black hole accretion disks push out against the infalling star both through the direct absorption and scattering of neutrinos on infalling matter and through the energy deposited in it as electron / positron pairs and photons from neutrino annihilation .",
    "neutrino annihilation , which provides most of the explosion energy , occurs primarily above the black hole along the rotation axis of the accretion disk .",
    "popham et al .",
    "( 1999 ) studied a range of likely accretion disk structures and calculated their resultant energy deposition through neutrino annihilation . using this study",
    ", we can derive the value of the matter density above the black hole for which the energy deposited by neutrinos is able to drive an explosion , and obtain an estimate of the mass of the black hole remnant left behind by this explosion .",
    "we will define the onset of the explosion as the moment when neutrino momentum deposition exceeds the pull of gravity on matter flowing onto the accretion disk along the rotation axis .",
    "the scattering opacity ( @xmath1 ) for neutrinos is roughly ( janka 2001 ) : @xmath2 where @xmath3 g is atomic mass unit , @xmath4mev is electron rest - mass energy , @xmath5@xmath6 , @xmath7 is the neutrino energy , @xmath8 is the density above the rotation axis , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the number fractions of free neutrons and protons .",
    "the corresponding absorption opacity ( @xmath11 ) for neutrinos is ( janka 2001 ) @xmath12 for the conditions in our disks , electron capture produces over half of the total neutrinos and electron neutrinos are the most abundant neutrino species .",
    "assuming this species dominates the absorption and scattering , the total neutrino opacity is @xmath13 here we have used the following assumptions : axial - vector couplings set to the charged - current axial - vector coupling constant in a vacuum , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , the neutrino temperature ( @xmath16 ) is related to neutrino energy by @xmath17 and that the entire neutrino flux is in the electron neutrino species .",
    "had we assumed an equal mix of electron and anti - electron neutrinos , the total opacity would not be different by more than 20% . as a shell of matter falls towards the black hole ,",
    "it is supported by the momentum of the scattered and absorbed neutrinos : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the neutrino luminosity , @xmath20 is the mass , @xmath21 the thickness , @xmath22 the radius of the shell , @xmath23 is neutrino velocity @xmath24 the speed of light .",
    "the corresponding acceleration from neutrino annihilation requires detailed models of the black hole accretion disk system .",
    "the disk models and annihilation calculations from popham et al .",
    "( 1999 ) led to a value for the energy deposited along a surface per unit path length ( @xmath25= { \\rm ergs \\",
    ", s^{-1 } \\ , cm^{-1}}$ ] ) . with this deposition rate @xmath26 , which is a function of height above the disk",
    ", we can calculate the acceleration due to neutrino annihilation inside a @xmath27 cone along the rotation axis : @xmath28    the onset of the explosion occurs when @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the gravitational acceleration with gravitational constant @xmath31 , and black hole mass @xmath32 . even for this high disk mass ,",
    "the change in the gravitational acceleration is less than 20% . ] . using equations 4 and 5",
    ", the acceleration condition for the onset of the explosion can be translated into a threshold condition on the density : @xmath33 for our estimates , we take the radii where the energy deposition from neutrino annihilation peaks ( @xmath3420 km ) .",
    "figure 1 gives critical densities for set values of @xmath35 versus an effective luminosity [ @xmath36 .",
    "the critical density rises sharply as the `` eddington '' luminosity for neutrinos is reached . the data ( @xmath35 at 20 km and @xmath19 ) for a series of disks from popham et al .",
    "( 1999 ) are also shown for comparison .",
    "these critical densities correspond to an accretion rate inside the @xmath27 cones along the rotation axes of @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the accretion rates for massive stars are initially much higher than these critical values , but the accretion rate decreases as material from increasingly outward layers of the star falls onto the black hole . in figure 2",
    "we plot the critical accretion rates for disks accreting @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xmath42 .",
    "note that the accretion rate through the disk need not be related to ( and at late times , is much higher than ) the accretion along the rotation axis . for comparison ,",
    "we plot the accretion rates of stars with masses ranging from 20 - 60@xmath43 ( rauscher et al .",
    "2002 ) versus mass coordinate of the accreting mass layer .",
    "when the accretion rate of stellar material falling along the polar axis drops below the critical accretion rate for a given disk , the neutrinos from the disk will drive an explosion and , very likely , disrupt the entire star .",
    "for a given disk structure , then , this crossing point gives a rough estimate of the remnant mass ( e.g. from fig .",
    "2 we see that for a disk accretion rate of @xmath44 onto a black hole rotating near breakup : a=0.95 , the remnant black hole mass for a @xmath45 star is roughly @xmath46 . )",
    "note also , that if the neutrino emission was as high as that given by the disks accreting at @xmath47 from popham et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , then the explosion would occur immediately .",
    "however , di matteo , perna , & narayan ( 2002 ) have found that these disks actually produce a much lower neutrino flux .",
    "even if such high neutrino luminosities could be constructed , they would disrupt their star immediately .",
    "we note that these results are only rough approximations , since a number of caveats limit the quantitative accuracy of these calculations . besides assuming a fairly simple model for the momentum deposition , relativistic effects on the neutrino energy and momentum , the effects of rotation on the infalling matter and the evolution of the black hole mass and spin were all neglected .",
    "if magnetic fields drive the explosion , the explosion can occur at much earlier times , and similarly , the disk winds seen by macfadyen & woosley ( 2000 ) also would eject the star at earlier times . most of these effects would lead to higher critical densities and lower remnant black hole masses . however , if we restrict ourselves to neutrino - driven explosions only , the major uncertainty is the structure of the progenitor star .",
    "figure 3 shows the infall accretion rates for rotating and non - rotating stars of 40 and 60 @xmath43 ( heger 2002 ) .",
    "note that the remnant mass differs dramatically depending upon the amount of rotation . comparing",
    "the non - rotating 60 @xmath43 case of fig.3 with that of fig.2 shows the variations arising from stars produced with different versions of the same stellar code : rauscher et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and heger ( 2002 ) use different versions of the kepler code ( weaver , zimmerman , & woosley 1978 ) .",
    "in addition to uncertainties in single star evolution , it is likely that collapsar grbs arise from binary systems , and binary progenitors of grbs have not yet been constructed .",
    "for most values of the disk accretion rates ( within roughly @xmath48 ) the critical density lies in a fairly narrow range between @xmath49 .",
    "these densities agree well with the results from macfadyen & woosley ( 1999 ) .",
    "for lower disk accretion rates , the energy deposition from neutrino annihilation decreases dramatically and the critical density for explosions drops below @xmath50 . the material along the poles does not reach this density until nearly all of the star has accreted onto the black hole , and this will not produce a grb .",
    "similarly , higher neutrino luminosities would disrupt the star immediately and probably never form in nature .",
    "with such a narrow range of explosion conditions at the black hole source , one would expect some similarities in the grb outbursts produced by neutrinos . however , bear in mind that the propogation of the jet through the star ( which can differ in different progenitors ) can significantly alter the observable outburst .",
    "what does differ dramatically is the time after the collapse at which the explosion occurs . from figures 2 and 3 , we know the mass zone of the star that is driven to explosion by the neutrinos . using the @xmath51 of heger ( 2002 ) and assuming that , along the rotation axis , the critical mass zone collapses at free - fall , we find that disks accreting at @xmath52 drive explosions at much different times .",
    "for the 40@xmath43 star , infalling material along the pole is turned around at 50,60 or @xmath53s after the initial collapse for black hole spin rates of a=0.95,0.75 and 0 , respectively . for the 60@xmath43 star ,",
    "the corresponding explosion times are : 35 , 300 , @xmath54s .",
    "hence , we should expect a considerable delay ( at least @xmath34 30s ) between the collapse ( as signalled by the initial neutrino and gravitational wave signal ) and the launch of the grb explosion .",
    "there are , however , upper limits to the delay .",
    "the explosion must occur , after all , before the disk accretes . using the convection dominated accretion flow ( cdaf ) solutions from narayan , piran , & kumar ( 2001 ) , we find that for accretion rates above @xmath55 and a total mass accreted through the disk less than @xmath46 , the total time including the delay since the collapse plus the burst duration can not be higher than 200s .",
    "those disks which do not explode before this time will not explode before the disk dissipates .    requiring that the accretion rate is at least @xmath55 places an upper limit on the disk formation radius ( the radius at which the angular momentum in the infalling stellar material supports it against the gravitational pull of the black hole ) .",
    "similarly , requiring that the disk maintains its accretion rate long enough to survive the delay times given above places a lower limit on the disk formation radius . using the cdaf solutions from narayan et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and assuming that the disk @xmath56 viscosity @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , a total mass accreted through the disk @xmath60 with at least @xmath61 in the disk , yields a range of disk formation radii from 28 - 7000 km .",
    "this corresponds to specific stellar angular momenta in the range : @xmath62 .",
    "although this is a narrow range of stellar angular momenta , it does lie within many of the current rotating models ( e.g. heger 2002 ) .    for neutrino - driven explosions from black hole accretion disks",
    ", we can derive the remnant mass of black holes .",
    "stars between @xmath63 are likely to have weak supernova explosions which ultimately lead to considerable fallback and the formation of a black hole ( fryer 1999 ) . if these stars have insufficient angular momentum , they produce a range of black hole masses between @xmath64 ( fryer & kalogera 2001 ) .",
    "if instead , they are rapidly rotating , they can form hypernovae and lower mass black holes ( nakamura et al .",
    "simulations by macfadyen , woosley , & heger ( 2001 ) show that @xmath65s after their weak explosions , the infall rates of these stars will drop below our critical densities ( assuming disk accretion rates in the range : @xmath66 ) and will drive explosions .",
    "these `` collapsar type ii '' objects will range from @xmath67 .    for direct collapse black holes which are the more likely grb candidate ,",
    "the currently most reliable progenitors ( rotating 40,60 @xmath43 stars ) , yield black hole remnants masses to range within 14 - 23@xmath43 with disk accretion rates in the range : @xmath68 .",
    "if other effects ( e.g. disk winds , magnetic fields ) are important , these masses could be lower .",
    "but not all stars will form grbs . for stars with insufficient angular momentum to produce these disk accretion rates , weak or",
    "no explosions are produced , and the remnant can be much more massive ( up to the mass of the star ) ."
