    "a diffusion process is called _ anomalous _ when the variance of the transported quantity , @xmath0 , grows in time as @xmath1 , with @xmath2 larger ( superdiffusion ) or smaller ( subdiffusion ) than one . a general approach to the analysis of stochastic transport is based on the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) , a probabilistic model where the motion of a walker in a medium is interpreted as a series of jumps of random lengths , separated by random waiting times @xcite .",
    "the theory of ctrw with power - law probability distribution functions ( pdf s ) for the waiting times was first introduced in physics in the late 1960s to describe anomalous diffusion of charge carriers in amorphous semiconductors @xcite .",
    "it was later applied with success to a broad spectrum of physical systems ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite for a review ) .    as a paradigmatic example of anomalous diffusion we consider here the case of contaminant transport through heterogeneous materials , such as porous sediments or fractured rocks .",
    "in this system the microscopic dynamics of each particle is assumed to be hindered by obstacles , dead ends , trapping events due to the interaction with the surrounding environment or abrupt changes in the flow field .",
    "the macroscopic effect is that the spread of the migrating particles plume grows sublinearly in time , thus resulting in _ subdiffusion",
    "these assumptions are substantially corroborated by many experimental observations @xcite .",
    "in general , the ctrw equations do not allow for closed - form analytical solutions .",
    "however , if suitable first - order approximations are introduced , a fractional diffusion equation can be formally derived from ctrw and analytical solutions can be obtained : in this respect , the fractional diffusion equation represents an asymptotic subset of ctrw @xcite .",
    "a complementary approach to the modeling of stochastic transport is provided by monte carlo simulation , a particle tracking method which allows the fate of each walker to be followed by sampling the jump lengths and the waiting times from a suitable distribution .",
    "monte carlo simulation has been widely adopted as a natural tool to obtain reliable and accurate estimates of the ctrw solutions @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the range of validity of the asymptotic fractional diffusion equation .",
    "this topic has been previously examined e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite . with the help of monte carlo simulations ,",
    "building on the discussion in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , we show that pre - asymptotic corrections to the fractional diffusion equations play a significant role , depending on the microscopic dynamics of the particles .",
    "neglect of these corrections would lead to gross errors in the estimation of model parameters from measured data . to overcome this problem , we derive a modified equation which incorporates these effects .",

    "[ corrections ] we show that for a given range of a critical parameter the fractional diffusion equation might not properly characterize the actual spread of the transported quantity as derived from ctrw ( through a monte carlo estimate ) .",
    "we discuss how to modify the fractional diffusion model so to include the contribution of pre - asymptotic corrections and validate the proposed results by comparing them to monte carlo simulations .",

    "we briefly review here the main assumptions of the ctrw model . consider a walker",
    "whose stochastic trajectory in a medium is modeled as a series of random jumps separated by random waiting times , during which the walker stays in the previously reached position .",

    ", @xmath3 represents the normalized particle concentration .",
    "the properties of the propagator depend on the jump lengths pdf @xmath6 and the waiting times pdf @xmath7 .",
    "once these distributions are assigned , it is possible to derive a probability equation for @xmath3 , the _ master equation _ of the ctrw model @xcite it can be shown @xcite that the master equation in @xmath8 space can be recast into a simple algebraic relation for the fourier and laplace transformed propagator @xmath9 and @xmath10 transform of a function by its argument : the variable @xmath4 is mapped to @xmath11 by the fourier transform and the variable @xmath5 is mapped to @xmath12 by the laplace transform , so that @xmath13 . ]",
    "@xmath14 with the walkers starting at @xmath15 at time @xmath16 .    within the ctrw scheme",
    "the long waiting times which characterize the trajectory of a contaminant particle moving through heterogeneous materials are taken into account by assuming that @xmath7 has a power - law tail @xmath17 , @xmath18 , when @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , @xmath7 lacks a characteristic time scale ( the average of the distribution is infinite ) and anomalously long waiting times have a non - negligible probability of being sampled . in the following",
    "we will assume a pareto pdf of the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a time constant .",
    "this specific form for @xmath7 has been chosen so that monte carlo sampling by inverse transform is straightforward : it can be shown that the short time behavior of the pdf is of minor importance and only the tail matters in determining the properties of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the jump length pdf @xmath6 is usually assumed to be a gaussian distribution , so that the jumps have a typical scale ( say the standard deviation of the distribution ) and extreme events , that is , jumps whose length are much larger than the standard deviation , are very improbable .    in general ,",
    "no analytical solution is known for eq .",
    "( [ ctrw_pdf ] ) , because the required inverse transforms are usually not trivial .",

    "more generally , it can be shown that any pdf of the kind @xmath17 would lead to the same expansion @xmath28 in the transformed space ; the specific value of the constant @xmath29 depends on the details of the function @xcite .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath6 is a gaussian with mean @xmath30 and variance @xmath31 , then @xmath32 becomes @xmath33 in the diffusion limit @xmath34 .",
    "any jump pdf with finite variance would asymptotically lead to the same result @xcite .",
    "we now introduce the _ riemann - liouville _ fractional derivative operator @xcite @xmath35 , which is defined by its action on a sufficiently well behaved function @xmath36 : @xmath37 the riemann - liouville operator is an integro - differential operator involving a convolution integral with a power - law kernel .",
    "in particular , the operator @xmath38 may be thought as a generalization of the usual multiple integral of integer order . from its definition",

    "fractional diffusion equation _ due to its fractional derivative , is a generalization of the classical fickian diffusion equation and describes the asymptotic behavior of a plume of subdiffusive particles in the absence of advection .",
    "a more general fractional differential equation was derived from ctrw in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the power - law kernel in @xmath35 decays slowly and macroscopically represents the long - range correlations induced by the obstacles that the particles encounter @xcite .",
    "if @xmath45 , the correlations decay sufficiently quickly so that normal diffusion is recovered @xcite .    in the context of contaminant transport",
    "it is of utmost importance to determine the evolution of the plume spread as a function of time .",
    "this physical quantity corresponds to the variance of the propagator . from the fractional diffusion equation",
    "it may be expressed in closed form as : @xmath46 because @xmath18 , the plume migration is subdiffusive , as expected .",
    "in principle , eq .",
    "( [ variance_fde_sub ] ) provides a reliable estimate of the actual contaminant spread when the diffusion limit is attained , that is , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , so that the fractional diffusion equation is a good asymptotic expansion of ctrw . to assess this statement",
    ", we compare the analytical variance ( [ variance_fde_sub ] ) with monte carlo simulation results for two values of @xmath2 .",
    "monte carlo estimates , which are obtained by simulating the microscopic dynamics of the particles , will be assumed as a reference solution of ctrw . in the first example , @xmath49 particles were followed up to a time @xmath50 , with the simulation parameters @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 ( see fig .  [ fig_fde_sub1 ] ) . in this case the fractional diffusion prediction ( [ variance_fde_sub ] ) agrees perfectly with the monte carlo simulation .",
    "next we let @xmath54 , with @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath50 ( see fig .  [ fig_fde_sub2 ] ) . in this case",
    "the fractional diffusion prediction ( [ variance_fde_sub ] ) underestimates the actual monte carlo spread , so that fractional diffusion can not be considered a good approximation of ctrw .",
    "the error introduced by the fractional diffusion prediction is far beyond the fluctuations due to the finite monte carlo statistics .",
    "we remark that in both cases the explored time scales are such that @xmath55 , thus ensuring that the diffusion limit has been attained .    what is the origin of the discrepancies shown in fig .",

    "straightforward but tedious calculations show that the expansion of @xmath28 to second order in @xmath12 yields : @xmath56 where @xmath57 . therefore , when the exponent @xmath2 is small , the linear term in @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ w_u_sub ] ) is expected to play no significant role in the limit @xmath48 , thus justifying the accuracy of the fractional diffusion equation predictions .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath58 , the two terms in the expansion ( [ w_u_sub ] ) become comparable and the effects of the linear contribution will no longer be negligible @xcite .",
    "more precisely , when @xmath18 the contribution of @xmath59 will always be subdominant with respect to @xmath60 ( for @xmath61 ) , so that after a sufficiently long time ( @xmath62 ) we always recover the fractional diffusion equation as the correct asymptotic limit of ctrw .",
    "in this respect the term @xmath59 introduces pre - asymptotic corrections to the behavior of the subdiffusive particles .",
    "however , the values of @xmath2 and @xmath21 are usually imposed by experiment and inherently linked to the choice of @xmath7 , that is , to the microscopic dynamics of the particles .",
    "it is therefore interesting to systematically explore the behavior of the ctrw and fractional diffusion solutions for intermediate time scales where the diffusion limit @xmath48 holds but the truncation of ( [ w_u_sub ] ) to the first non - constant term might not be appropriate , depending on the value of @xmath2 .",
    "to quantitatively assess the relevance of the contribution @xmath59 in the expansion of @xmath28 , we substitute eq .",
    "( [ w_u_sub ] ) into the propagator ( [ ctrw_pdf ] ) , to obtain : @xmath63 by making use of the formal properties of the riemann - liouville operators , eq .",

    "we argue that eq .",
    "( [ frac_transport ] ) , which is the central result of our work , also provides a suitable description of the particle dynamics for pre - asymptotic time scales . to support this argument",
    "we compute the spread associated to eq .",

    "@xmath71 the inverse @xmath10 transform appearing in eq .",
    "( [ ffpk_inv_moment ] ) can be computed numerically @xcite .",
    "the curves thus obtained are again compared with monte carlo simulation .",
    "figure  [ fig_fde_sub3 ] clearly shows that the modified eq .",
    "( [ frac_transport ] ) provides a reliable estimate of the system evolution even at pre - asymptotic time scales .",
    "the fractional diffusion equation arises as an asymptotic approximation to an exact master equation and suffers from some limitations @xcite . as an example , although anomalous diffusion is often experimentally found to be a transient phase , which after a suitable time scale generally relaxes to fickian diffusion , the fractional diffusion equation can not take into account for this transition because the anomalous behavior is assumed to hold even at infinite time @xcite .",
    "moreover , the ctrw formulation in terms of a generalized fokker - planck equation with a memory kernel recently proposed e.g. in @xcite can take into account more general expressions for @xmath28 ( as compared to to those allowed by the fractional derivative approach ) , as well as boundary and initial conditions in multiple dimensions . in this respect , the ctrw formalism , thanks to its greater flexibility , can capture and quantify more general tranport instances , as shown e.g. in @xcite .    it must be also emphasized that not all anomalous diffusion phenomena can be represented in a fractional derivative formalism , since anomalous diffusion is usually context - dependent many specific realizations do not fall within this framework ( even though enlarged so to include pre - asymptotic corrections ) .",
    "this is the case , for instance , of the diffusion problems studied by @xcite , where slower than fickian , but faster than algebraic decays are found , or by @xcite , where anomalous transport in a fracture network gives rise to a scaling which is at variance with the power - law predicted by the fractional derivative framework .",
    "nonetheless , a relevant feature of the fractional diffusion equation ( in spite of its limitations ) is that the fractional derivative formulation may easily include external fields in a simple manner and is naturally suitable for solving boundary value problems @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the fractional diffusion equation has been recently shown to act as a unifying framework for the quantitative description of different physical phenomena where anomalous diffusion plays a significant role @xcite . moreover , many standard mathematical techniques for solving partial differential equations are readily applicable to the fractional diffusion equation .    in the context of particle transport in heterogeneous materials",
    "the fractional diffusion formulation may be used to analyze the evolution of the contaminant plume spread in time . comparing the model prediction with measured experimental data",
    "could then lead to an estimate of the exponent @xmath2 characterizing the system .",
    "it is therefore important to quantify the limit of validity of the fractional diffusion asymptotic subset . in this paper",
    "we have shown that , if @xmath72 , the pre - asymptotic corrections to fractional diffusion might significantly affect the model predictions .",
    "their neglect would induce gross errors in the model which would distort the estimate of @xmath2 . to overcome this problem ,",
    "we have derived a modified transport equation involving fractional derivatives : we have shown that the particle spread predicted by this model is in excellent agreement with monte carlo simulation also at the pre - asymptotic time scales .",
    "this modified equation might be suitable to explore the subdiffusive dynamics of physical systems close to the limit @xmath72 .",
    "finally , we remark that analogous pre - asymptotic corrections would come into play also in the case of diffusive dynamics ( @xmath45 ) , if we were to adopt a power - law decaying distribution for the waiting times .",
    "these corrections would have a significant role close to the limit @xmath72 and their origin is in the nature of the functional form of @xmath7 .",
    "only , the role of the two contributions would be the opposite with respect to the case examined in this work : the dominant contribution would come from the term in @xmath12 , the term in @xmath73 being subdominant for @xmath61 , as expected . as a particular case ,",
    "it is also possible to choose the ( arbitrary ) waiting time distribution so that the coefficient @xmath74 is identically zero : a widely adopted choice is assuming a lvy stable law for @xmath7 , so that its laplace transform expansion would not contain the term in @xmath12 .",
