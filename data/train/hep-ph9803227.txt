    "combining chiral perturbation theory with heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) gives a good description of the low energy strong interactions between the pseudo - goldstone bosons and mesons containing a single heavy quark .",

    "the value of the coupling @xmath8 is important , since it appears in the expressions for many measurable quantities at low energy .",
    "these include the rate @xmath30 @xcite , form factors for weak transitions between heavy and light pseudo - scalars @xcite , decay constants for the heavy mesons @xcite , weak transitions to vector mesons @xcite , form factors for @xmath31 @xcite , and heavy meson mass splittings @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the value of @xmath8 has remained somewhat elusive , with numbers in the literature from @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "recently , a cleo measurement @xcite of @xmath34 has brought the experimental uncertainties to a level where a model independent extraction of @xmath8 is possible from @xmath18 decays .    as a consequence of hqs the mass splitting between @xmath18 and @xmath26 mesons",
    "is small ( of order @xmath35 ) , leaving only a small amount of phase space for @xmath18 decays . in the dominant modes , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , the outgoing pion and photon are soft making the chiral expansion a valid framework .",
    "the branching ratios for @xmath4 decay are @xmath38  ( 67.6% ) , @xmath39  ( 30.7% ) and @xmath40  ( 1.7% ) @xcite .",
    "a @xmath3 can only decay into @xmath41  ( 61.9% ) and @xmath42  ( 38.1% ) @xcite since there is not enough phase space for @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath44 decays predominantly to @xmath45  ( 94.2% ) with a small amount going into the isospin violating mode @xmath46  ( 5.8% ) @xcite .",
    "since a measurement of the widths of the @xmath18 mesons has not yet been made , it is only possible to compare the ratios of branching fractions with theoretical predictions .",

    "this value is often used in experimental extractions of the branching ratios to reduce systematic errors .",
    "it is interesting to note that the quark model predictions@xcite for @xmath3 and @xmath4 decays agree qualitatively with the data .",
    "one can understand , for instance , why the branching ratio @xmath49 is small compared to @xmath50 . in the quark model",
    "the photon couples to the meson with a strength proportional to the sum of the magnetic moments of the two quarks , @xmath51 for @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath54 . the rate for the former is then suppressed by a factor @xmath55 where we have used mass ratios appropriate for constituent quarks , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "this suppression results from the opposite signs in @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which in turn follow from the ( quark ) charge assignments and spin wavefunctions for the heavy mesons .    in the quark model @xmath60 and @xmath61 , while for the chiral quark model @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "relativistic quark models tend to give smaller values , @xmath63 @xcite , as do qcd sum rules , @xmath64 @xcite .",

    "further @xmath11 and @xmath12 contributions considered here include the effect of nonzero @xmath18@xmath26 and @xmath73@xmath74 mass splittings , and the exact kinematics corresponding to nonzero outgoing pion or photon energy in the loop diagrams .",
    "( their inclusion is motivated numerically since @xmath75 , and the decay @xmath76 only occurs if @xmath77 . ) to simplify the organization of the calculation these splittings will be included as residual mass terms in our heavy meson propagators .",
