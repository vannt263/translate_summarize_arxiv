    "this phenomenon overcomes the diffraction limit and allows for resolution at the molecular level @xcite .    within the field of plasmonics ,",
    "single or few nanostructures have been the cynosure so far .",
    "however , the attention is rapidly shifting to metamaterials constituted by ordered arrays of nanostructures .",
    "the periodic arrangement of the nanostructures in the array , as well as the interactions between the lsps on each nanostructure can be exploited in a variety of novel artificial materials exhibiting properties far beyond those seen in nature , leading to fascinating applications such as electromagnetic invisibility cloaking @xcite , perfect lensing @xcite and slow light @xcite .",
    "the interaction between lsps on individual nanostructures generates collective plasmonic modes that extend over the whole array @xcite . as a consequence",
    "the collective plasmons can exhibit a variety of properties that crucially depend on the lattice structure of the metamaterial , and on the microscopic interactions between lsp resonances .    among the infinite possible nanostructure arrangements ,",
    "one structure that has gained considerable attention in the condensed matter community within the last decade is the honeycomb structure of graphene ( see figure [ fig : honeycomb1 ] ) , a two - dimensional ( 2d ) monolayer of carbon atoms @xcite .",
    "the honeycomb structure can be regarded as a special bipartite lattice formed by two inequivalent hexagonal sublattices , denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with equal nearest neighbour separation for all carbon - carbon bonds .",
    "the hopping of electrons between neighbouring atoms in graphene produces a spectrum characterised by the presence of massless fermionic dirac quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "these pseudo - relativistic dirac fermions have an associated chirality which leads to several of the remarkable properties of graphene , such as a nontrivial berry phase of @xmath2 responsible for the anomalous quantum hall effect @xcite , as well as the suppression of electronic back - scattering from smooth scatterers @xcite .",

    "in fact , a 2d honeycomb array of metallic nanoparticles has been shown to support collective plasmons ( cps ) that behave as unprecedented chiral massless dirac bosons . moreover ,",
    "the band structure of these collective modes was found to be fully tunable with the polarisation of the incident light that triggers the cps , a feature which is not available in real graphene devices .",
    "honeycomb plasmonic arrays of metallic nanoparticles thus open interesting perspectives for the realisation of ultrathin tunable metamaterials where the electromagnetic radiation can be transported effectively by chiral pseudo - relativistic dirac modes .",
    "in this paper we further explore the optical response of bipartite arrays of metallic nanoparticles beyond the artificial graphene plasmonic lattice .",
    "firstly , in section [ sec : perfect ] , we exploit the tunability of the cp band structure and analyse in detail the phase diagram of gapless and gapped phases that emerge while tilting the orientation of the dipole moments associated with lsps .",
    "we show that there are several topologically disconnected regions of the phase diagram which support cps behaving as massless dirac quasiparticles . in section [ sec : broken ] we then extend the analysis of the plasmonic array by considering a honeycomb structure with broken inversion symmetry in which the two inequivalent sublattices are made of nanoparticles with different lsp frequencies .",
    "such an approach is relevant for the description of bipartite arrays where the nanoparticles in the two sublattices are either made of different metals , or they are intentionally designed to have different size or shape . in this case we highlight the emergence of gapped chiral dirac plasmons characterised by an energy - dependent berry phase . in the last part of the paper ( section [ sec : deformed ] )",
    "we explore the interesting scenario of bipartite lattices that break the angular symmetry of the honeycomb array and study the evolution of the aforementioned phase diagram .",
    "we show that a sequence of topological phase transitions occurs in the phase diagram while progressively shifting one sublattice with respect to the other .",
    "this analysis highlights the existence of massless dirac plasmons in a vast family of bipartite lattices beyond the honeycomb one , but at the same time it identifies critical values of lattice displacements that lead to the progressive disappearance of massless dirac plasmons into gapped modes .",
    "our conclusions are finally presented in section  [ sec : ccl ] .",
    "a short description of the videos accompanying our paper is given in [ sec : video ] .",
    "in this section we set the scene for the rest of the paper by revisiting the properties of an ensemble of identical spherical metallic nanoparticles forming a 2d honeycomb structure @xcite , and conducting a thorough analysis of the resultant cps .",

    "each individual spherical nanoparticle of radius @xmath10 supports an lsp resonance , which can be triggered by an oscillating external electric field , with wavelength @xmath11 .",
    "under such a condition , the collective electronic excitation associated with the lsp can be modelled as a point dipole with a natural frequency of oscillation @xmath12 that depends on the size , shape and structure of the nanoparticles , as well as on their environment @xcite .",
    "the dipolar lsps have a dipole moment @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the electronic charge , @xmath15 is the number of valence electrons in each nanoparticle , @xmath16 is the displacement field associated with the electronic centre - of - mass motion that corresponds to the lsp at position @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the dipole unit vector . the lsp can be regarded as a bosonic mode , in particular when the size of the nanoparticle is small enough such that quantum size effects are important @xcite .",
    "the nature of the coupling between lsps in different nanoparticles depends on their size and inter - particle distance .",
    "the interactions between the dipolar lsps lead to collective plasmonic modes that extend over the whole system . under the condition that @xmath19",
    ", we consider each dipole to interact with its neighbours through dipole - dipole interactions and only take into account the near field generated by each dipole @xcite .",
    "such a quasistatic approximation is reliable if @xmath20 and has been shown to qualitatively reproduce the results of more sophisticated simulations which include retardation effects @xcite . within this approximation",
    ", the interaction between two dipoles @xmath21 and @xmath22 , located at @xmath17 and @xmath23 respectively , reads @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "as the cps will be triggered by an external radiation of a given polarisation , we assume that all the dipoles point along the same direction and parametrise their orientations as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the angle between @xmath18 and @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the angle between the projection of @xmath18 in the @xmath30-plane and @xmath31 ( see figure [ fig : honeycomb1 ] ) .",

    "finally , the coefficients @xmath45 appearing in the hamiltonian depend on the polarisation angles @xmath46 and hence represent tunable interaction parameters that crucially influence the cp band structure .",
    "note that in equation we only consider the interaction between nearest neighbours , as the effect of interactions beyond nearest neighbours has been shown not to qualitatively change the plasmonic spectrum @xcite .",
    "the analogy between our plasmonic structure and the electronic properties of graphene becomes apparent by introducing the bosonic ladder operators @xmath47 which annihilate an lsp on a nanoparticle located at position @xmath48 belonging to the @xmath0 or @xmath1 sublattice , respectively .",

    "this case is directly analogous to the electronic tight - binding problem in pristine graphene , where the hopping parameters between nearest neighbour carbon atoms are all equal .",
    "in fact , the spectrum given in presents two inequivalent dirac cones @xcite , similar to those present in the electronic band structure of graphene @xcite .",

    "up to a global energy shift of @xmath101 , equation corresponds to a massless dirac hamiltonian for the cps and shows that the corresponding spinor eigenstates represent dirac - like massless bosonic excitations that present similar effects to those of electrons in graphene @xcite .",

    "thus the lattice can still be considered as made of two hexagonal sublattices @xmath0 and @xmath1 , but with the @xmath1 sublattice shifted by a vector @xmath209 such that the new nearest - neighbour vectors now become @xmath211 ( see figures [ fig : honeycomb1](a ) and [ fig : deformed_lattice ] ) .",
    "this rigid shift breaks the three - fold rotational symmetry of the original honeycomb case .",
    "the main questions then to be addressed concern the very existence of dirac cps and the fate of the phase diagram while progressively distorting the original lattice .    the mathematical procedure to obtain the hamiltonian and the band structure for cps in the general bipartite hexagonal system is a straightforward extension of that presented in section [ sec : perfect ] .",
    "the replacement of the new nearest neighbour vectors @xmath212 in the hamiltonian leads to the dispersion relation @xmath213 with @xmath214 here , @xmath215 is a generalisation of @xmath111 defined in equation , with @xmath216 the angle between @xmath212 and the projection of the lsp polarisation @xmath18 into the @xmath203-@xmath204 plane . unlike in the honeycomb case , the lengths of the nearest neighbour vectors are not all equivalent , hence the extra term @xmath217 in @xmath218 .     at which the collective plasmon spectrum is gapped or gapless ( orange and cream regions , respectively ) for different positions of the @xmath1 sublattice , parametrised by the vector @xmath209 ( see figure  [ fig : deformed_lattice ] ) .",
    "panel ( a ) corresponds to @xmath219 , i.e. , a perfect honeycomb lattice ( see the phase diagram in figure [ fig : phasediagramhoneycomb](a ) ) , while in panels ( b ) @xmath220 , ( c ) @xmath221 , ( d ) @xmath222 and ( e ) @xmath223 . ]",
    "an equivalent analysis to that in section [ sec : pd ] for the new bipartite lattices yields the resulting phase diagrams which identify the domains of lsp polarisation leading to the existence of dirac cp quasiparticles . from equation",
    "we obtain the condition for gapless plasmonic dispersions at an arbitrary polarisation , @xmath224 figure [ fig : phasetransitions ] shows the resulting phase diagrams in the @xmath69 parameter space for five different lattices , where the cream and orange regions indicate gappless and gapped cp spectra , respectively . while figure [ fig : phasetransitions](a ) corresponds to the undeformed honeycomb lattice for which @xmath225 ( see also figure [ fig : phasediagramhoneycomb](a ) ) , figures [ fig : phasetransitions](b)-(e ) are obtained by progressively displacing the @xmath1 sublattice in the @xmath226 direction ( see figure [ fig : deformed_lattice ] ) . the phase diagram in figure [ fig : phasetransitions](b ) , obtained for @xmath220 is topologically equivalent to the one of the undeformed lattice ( figure [ fig : phasetransitions](a ) ) . despite the rather small displacement ( less than @xmath227{\\%}$ ] of @xmath3 )",
    ", the broken discrete rotational symmetry of the lattice induces an evident bulging of the phase diagram compared to the undeformed case . for larger deformations , in figures [ fig : phasetransitions](b ) to [ fig : phasetransitions](e ) we observe that the topology of the phase diagram changes , as indicated by the arrows in the figure .",
    "for example , when going from @xmath220 to @xmath221 ( figure [ fig : phasetransitions](b ) to [ fig : phasetransitions](c ) ) , a compact gapless domain splits into two disconnected pockets separated by a gapped phase . in contrast , when going from @xmath221 to @xmath222 ( figure [ fig : phasetransitions](c ) to [ fig : phasetransitions](d ) ) , the topological phase transition occurs by annihilation of a gapless domain into a gapped one .",
    "finally , when going from @xmath222 to @xmath223 ( figure [ fig : phasetransitions](d ) to [ fig : phasetransitions](e ) ) , the transition occurs by merging three topologically disconnected gapless domains into one .",
    "even larger deformations lead to a phase diagram that is mostly dominated by gapped phases .",
    "the five phase diagrams shown in figure [ fig : phasetransitions ] are snapshots from the video http://www.ipcms.unistra.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/deformed_bipartite_lattice.mp4[`deformed_bipartite_lattice.mp4 ` ] , which shows a large succession of phase diagrams corresponding to lattice deformations from @xmath225 to @xmath228 . as is clear from the video and can be inferred from panels ( c ) and ( d ) in figure [ fig : phasetransitions ] , the spectrum for the polarisation @xmath102 , for which the analogy between our cps and electrons in graphene holds @xcite , is gapped for deformations larger than @xmath229 .",
    "whilst we are not discussing elastic deformations of real graphene membranes @xcite it is insightful to note that the literature on strained graphene suggests that a ca .",
    "@xmath230{\\%}$ ] change in one of the nearest - neighbour hopping lengths is needed to merge the two dirac points and open a gap in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : trianglediagram ] further illuminates the qualitatively distinct physical regimes realisable in different lattices for the same dipole polarisation . for @xmath102 , figure [ fig : trianglediagram](a ) shows the cp band gap @xmath105 in units of the coupling @xmath106 as a function of the position of the @xmath1 sublattice ( white regions indicate a gapless cp dispersion ) . for a perfect honeycomb array ,",
    "the @xmath1 sublattice is located at the center of the triangle ( black dot ) defined by the three neighbouring nanoparticles in sublattice @xmath0 ( depicted as blue circles in the figure ) .",
    "the grey areas indicate regions for which the interparticle distance is smaller than @xmath231 and where the dipole - dipole approximation breaks down such that higher multipoles need to be taken into account .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the gapless dispersion is robust in a sizeable region around the point @xmath225 ( see dot in the figure ) . while shifting the @xmath1 sublattice towards the @xmath0 one , a non - vanishing gap forms , whose magnitude progressively increases . where further neighbour terms in the interaction become increasingly important .",
    "]    to emphasise that indeed the gapless domain in figure [ fig : trianglediagram](a ) supports dirac cps , we focus on the particular displacement @xmath232 indicated by a cross in the figure .",
    "for such a bipartite hexagonal lattice , the two inequivalent dirac points are located at @xmath233 , close to which the function @xmath234 defined in equation expands as @xmath235 .",
    "thus , close to the dirac points the cp dispersion describes massless dirac cps with an angular - dependent group velocity , as shown in figure [ fig : trianglediagram](b ) .",
    "we have studied the tunable plasmonic response of an artificial analogue of graphene constituted by a 2d hexagonal bipartite lattice of metallic nanoparticles .",
    "we have analysed the band structure of collective plasmons stemming from the near field dipolar coupling between localised surface plasmons in individual nanoparticles . in the case of a perfect honeycomb array ,",
    "we have explored in detail the rich phase diagram of gapless and gapped phases emerging from tilting the polarisation of the dipole moments .",
    "we have shown that each topologically disconnected gapless phase supports collective plasmons that are effectively described by a massless dirac hamiltonian .",
    "the emergence of gapped phases from gapless ones occurs via the coalescence of dirac cones while progressively tilting the dipole orientation , in analogy to what would occur for electrons in real graphene under extreme elastic strain . for perfect honeycomb arrays with two inequivalent sublattices",
    "we unveil that collective plasmons are effectively described as gapped dirac particles with an energy - dependent berry phase .",
    "we also studied the plasmonic properties of bipartite hexagonal arrays obtained from the honeycomb structure by rigidly shifting one sublattice with respect to the other .",
    "this system is still highly tunable with the orientation of the dipoles and supports gapless dirac plasmons as well as gapped phases .",
    "the phase diagram undergoes significant changes for lattice displacements of a few percent , with a series of topological phase transitions that split and annihilate gapless dirac phases .",
    "our analysis shows that a large family of bipartite arrays of metallic nanoparticles can support dirac plasmonic modes .",
    "these could efficiently transport highly confined radiation through the 2d metamaterial .",
    "while gapless dirac phases exist in generic hexagonal bipartite lattices , they occupy a progressively small portion of the phase diagram for increasing deformations",
    ". this analysis will be important for designing the properties of novel plasmonic metamaterials based on bipartite lattices , e.g. , by assembling dimers in ordered structures or by means of self - assembled materials with less symmetry than the honeycomb structure .",
    "the collective plasmons in our work constitute the building block for the analysis of the optical properties of dirac metamaterials .",
    "this would involve a quantum treatment of the coupling between photons and collective plasmons resulting in tunable plasmon polaritons that may inherit some of the effective dirac - like properties studied in the present work .",
    "a preliminary work in this direction @xcite has shown that plasmon polaritons in a simple 3d cubic array of metallic nanoparticles present a band structure that is tunable with the polarisation of light , leading to birefringence which is purely due to interaction effects between dipolar localised surface plasmons .",
    "a crucial question to be addressed in the quest of designing arrays of metallic nanoparticles supporting dirac - like collective plasmons is the inherent damping that these collective modes suffer from .",
    "localised surface plasmons in individual metallic nanoparticles are subject to three main sources of dissipation @xcite : absorption ( ohmic ) losses , that do not depend on the size of the nanoparticle , radiation losses that scale as the volume of the nanoparticle , and landau damping , a purely quantum - mechanical effect whose associated decay rate is inversely proportional to the nanoparticle radius .",
    "the two latter damping mechanisms suggest that there exists an optimal nanoparticle radius for which the total damping rate is minimised , estimated in reference @xcite to be around @xmath236{nm}$ ] for silver nanoparticles .",
    "the interaction between the localised surface plasmons in each nanoparticle forming the bipartite lattice may change the picture above .",
    "indeed , recent theoretical results on metallic nanoparticle dimers @xcite suggest that while landau damping is weakly influenced by the dipolar interaction , radiation damping strongly depends of the wavelength of the collective mode .",
