    "velocity gradients suggestive of galaxy cluster rotation were found in several studies ( e.g. kalinkov 1968 , gregory 1975 , gregory & tifft 1976 , gregory & thompson 1977 , materne & hopp 1983 , materne 1984 , williams 1986 , oegerle & hill 1992 , sodr et al 1992 , biviano et al .",

    "it is commonly accepted opinion that there is no evidence of rotation of the galaxy clusters , however , if the galaxy clusters rotate their dynamics and dynamical evolution would be different .",
    "the velocity dispersion profiles must be corrected for the rotation and the corresponding virial mass estimation will be different .",
    "many theoretical constructions are based on the assumption of no rotation ",
    "e.g. the infall models and especially the theory of caustics ( regs & geller 1989 , diaferio & geller 1997 , van haarlem et al .",

    "2003 ) .    here",
    "we make an another attempt to reveal rotation in the galaxy cluster a2107 .",
    "we have chosen this particular cluster to illustrate our method , because it is well studied and indications of rotations were already found ( oegerle & hill 1992 ) .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we present our method , the different bootstrap techniques that we use to estimate the uncertainties of the derived rotational parameters are presented in section 3 . in the next section 4",
    "we present the data for a2107 and in section 5 our results .",
    "we finish with discussion and conclusions ( section 6 ) . in order to compare our results with the previous studies we assume an einstein - de sitter cosmology and @xmath6 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 . for this model at the cluster redshift @xmath8 , @xmath9 correspond to 358 kpc .",
    "we consider a flat , disk - like galaxy cluster with regions with nearly solid body rotation .",
    "the main idea is to find the axis of the maximum velocity gradient which , in the disk - like model , defines the major axis of the cluster .",
    "the minor axis is the axis of rotation .",
    "it is known the rotational effects are weak and their search would be successful if some cumulative technique is applied .",
    "let us take sub - samples @xmath10 of the cluster member galaxies , arranged by their projected distance from the cluster centre .",
    "thus any sub - sample @xmath10 contains the first @xmath11 galaxies out to a given projected distance @xmath12 .",
    "the sub - samples @xmath10 are not independent .",
    "let us introduce an axis passing through the cluster centre and rotating around it and we define the positional angle @xmath13 in the usual way ( anticlockwise from n ) as shown on fig .  1 .",
    "we assume the axis has direction in sense sn to we , ns , ew . in this case",
    "the positional angle is @xmath14 .",
    "spans the whole range from @xmath15 to @xmath16 degrees .",
    ", width=302 ]    we project the galaxies from sub - sample @xmath10 onto an axis with positional angle @xmath13 and examine the linear regression @xmath17 where @xmath1 is the observed line - of - sight velocity , @xmath0 are the projected cluster - centric distances on the chosen axis , @xmath18 is the mean of @xmath19 for the sub - sample @xmath10 , and in fact @xmath20 .",
    "our aim is to find the maximum gradient in the velocity field . in linear approximation",
    ", this corresponds to the axis with @xmath21 for which the linear correlation coefficient between @xmath1 and @xmath0 is maximal , @xmath22 .",
    "consequently , the standard deviation ( st.dev . ) of the regression for the sub - sample \\{i } @xmath23 is minimal and we denote it by @xmath24 which corresponds to @xmath22 for the same @xmath13 ; @xmath25 is the line - of - sight velocity estimate , derived from the regression .",
    "if the velocity field of a flat cluster is influenced by rotation then the maximum velocity gradient will be along the major axis @xmath26 ( or equally , along the axis of maximum elongation ) .",
    "the positional angle of the maximum velocity gradient is @xmath27 , where the indexes @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the maximum correlation coefficient and the minimum standard deviation of the regression estimate .",
    "correspondingly , the axis of rotation is at @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes zero correlation coefficient .",
    "note that there are two positional angles where @xmath32 is zero .",
    "we define the position of the minor axis with @xmath33 .",
    "searching for the major axis or maximum elongation axis with a limited number of cluster members is prone to large uncertainties and few interlopers could bias the estimated ellipticity and shape .",
    "much better approach would be by using x - ray observations because the hot gas maps better the cluster potential and subsequently the cluster shape .",
    "unfortunately the positional angles of the maximum elongation in the cluster cores are known to vary depending on the x - ray isophote level .",
    "the virial mass @xmath34 of a cluster is defined through the velocity dispersion @xmath35 .",
    "in fact , @xmath36 if the cluster rotates the velocity dispersion has to be corrected ( @xmath37 ) , according to the formula above , but with @xmath24 instead of @xmath38 .",
    "then @xmath39 is a fictitious mass , due to rotation .    supposing that some noticeable effects of rotation really exist , then , with our approach , we expect the following indications :    1 .   the correlation coefficient @xmath22 will be significant for at least few consecutive sub - samples @xmath10 .",
    "the positional angles @xmath21 for these consecutive sub - samples will not be randomly distributed along the entire range of @xmath13 , but in a relatively narrow interval .",
    "the variation of @xmath32 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 would be close to sine waves and , for sub - samples @xmath10 with significant @xmath22 , the phase shifts of both curves should be according to ( ii ) , in a narrow range .",
    "the expressions for the sine waves of @xmath32 and @xmath40 are @xmath42 and @xmath43 \\sin(\\varphi - \\varphi_{r0})\\ ] ] 4 .   the virial mass for some sub - samples @xmath10 will be significantly different as computed for @xmath38 and @xmath24 .",
    "the question of uncertainties is a crucial one because the effects of rotation are weak . where it is possible we rely on bootstrap uncertainties .",
    "we apply two bootstrap techniques .",
    "the first one is the standard or the classical bootstrap ( b ) - ( efron 1982 , efron & tibshirani 1986 ) .",
    "shortly , for each sub - sample we find the positional angle @xmath21 and then resample the velocities @xmath1 and the projected distances @xmath0 on this axis in order to derive the bootstrap uncertainties of @xmath44 .",
    "this procedure however has the disadvantage that it is impossible to find the uncertainties of @xmath21 and @xmath45 .",
    "that is why we apply simultaneously a modified bootstrap ( mb ) techniques : the positions and velocities of sub - sample @xmath10 are subject to bootstrap resampling after which the search for @xmath22 is carried out and the corresponding @xmath46 , ... are derived .",
    "note that each bootstrap sample leads to completely different @xmath47 , ...    in all cases , we run @xmath48 bootstrap generations and calculate the corresponding quantities for @xmath49 with a decrement of @xmath50 we use the resulting distribution of the quantity in question to derive the confidence interval .",
    "let us denote with @xmath51 whatever of the quantities we discuss .",
    "the first estimator of the uncertainty we use is the bias - corrected ( bc ) @xmath52 confidence interval @xmath53 $ ] ( efron & tibshirani 1986 ) with @xmath54\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the observed mean value , and @xmath58 is the cdf of the normal distribution ( thus @xmath59 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively ) .",
    "this uncertainty is @xmath62 .",
    "efron & tibshirani ( 1986 ) uncertainty is effectively used by shepherd et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and kalinkov , valtchanov & kuneva ( 1998a ) for the space correlation functions of galaxies and clusters of galaxies .",
    "the second estimator of the uncertainty we implement is the bootstrap standard deviation ( ling , barrow & frenk 1986 ) @xmath63^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the mean bootstrap value .",
    "this st.dev .",
    "is very effectively used by kalinkov & kuneva ( 1986 ) .",
    "we have found that both uncertainties @xmath65 and @xmath66 are consistent with each other , but we prefer @xmath62 , since the estimator is valid even if the distribution of @xmath67 is not gaussian .    the uncertainty on the correlation coefficient can also be computed using the classical fisher z - transformation ( e.g. press et al .",
    "1992 , section 14.5 ) .",
    "the uncertainties derived by this method are also consistent with the other two .",
    "there is one problem ",
    "the bootstrap technique does not work when we determine the uncertainties of the virial mass estimates . in the resampling ,",
    "some objects are duplicated and consequently the distance between them is zero and the cluster potential tends to infinity . in this case",
    "only we apply the jackknife estimate ( see e.g. efron 1982 ) .    in order to assess the significance of the derived quantities we use randomised sub - samples for which the azimuthal angles ( or @xmath13 ) of the galaxies centres are made randomly distributed in the interval @xmath68 .",
    "this new sample is subject to the same procedure of parameter and confidence interval estimates . here",
    "the uncertainties are only @xmath65 .",
    "it is worth to note that with this procedure the observed radial density and velocity distributions are not altered .",
    "coordinates and heliocentric velocities of galaxies in the direction of a2107 are taken predominantly from the most complete optical study of oegerle & hill ( 1992 )  further on oh . some corrections and additions are made according to ned ( new redshifts and coordinates ) and therefore new observational errors are defined .",

    "materne & hopp ( 1983 ) have shown that it is extremely hard ( if generally possible ) to distinguish the case of a single cluster in rotation from the case of two overlapping clusters , which are merging or departing from each other .",
    "that is why oh , investigating the same cluster a2107 , have examined both possibilities .",
    "they employed the @xmath149-test of dressler & shectman ( 1988 ) and they have found that there is significant sub - structuring in a2107 . supposing that @xmath150 , when there is no spatial - velocity correlation , oh performed 1000 monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and found @xmath151 ( see also oegerle & hill 2001 ) .",

    "one against two centres .",
    "we have used another powerful test especially for two sub - structures ( lee 1979 ) , introduced in the cluster sub - structure studies by fitchett ( 1988 ) and successfully applied by fitchett & webster ( 1987 ) , rhee , van haarlem & katgert ( 1991b ) , pinkney et al .",

    "the corresponding positional angle of the two sub - cluster centres is @xmath162 .",
    "but the subclustering does not rule out the hypothesis of rotation .",
    "it is plausible that the cause of sub - clustering in the dressler - shectman diagram ( fig .",
    "5 of oh ) is just due to the rotation , since the most prominent clumpiness is along the maximum gradient in the velocity field of a2107 , indicated by our @xmath21 .",
    "indeed , from galaxy studies we know that the velocity field of disk - like rotating galaxies without any massive halo has two extremes , @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "this would cause apparent sub - clustering .",
    "but if there are two overlapping clusters , then it will be unlikely they will generate a mimicry of rotation ",
    "first of all , the velocity histogram will have two peaks or quite broad velocity distribution with rather unrealistically high velocity dispersion .",
    "none of this is observed in a2107 .",
    "secondly , we have investigated the behaviour of correlation coefficients , positional angles etc . from our point of view , if there are two sub - clusters that are located at positional angle close to @xmath21 , this would be regarded as evidence for rotation .",
    "nevertheless some authors disregard this possibility as the cause of the velocity gradient ( den hartog & katgert 1996 ) .",
    "our strongest evidence for rotation is the consistent measure of the positional angle of the velocity gradient @xmath21 for consecutive cumulative sub - samples .",
    "one way of validating the inferred positional angle is to compare it with the positional angle of the elongation of the cluster @xmath165 . for our flat disk - like model @xmath166 . debating the binggeli s effect ( binggeli 1982 )",

    "there are examples of drastic variations of @xmath165 in some clusters in the most elaborate paper on this subject ( burgett et al .",
    "2004 ) .    as stated above",
    "there are two possibilities to explain the velocity gradient in a galaxy cluster - two - body model or rotation .",
    "an anonymous referee however turned our attention on a third possibility : according to simulations of galactic tides in dwarf spheroidal galaxies piatek & pryor ( 1995 ) have shown that tides produce large ordered motions which induce apparent rotation .",
    "biviano et al .",
    "( 1996 ) assume that the velocity gradient in the central part of coma cluster maybe due to tidal effects caused by falling groups of galaxies and not by rotation .",

    "it is due not to rotation but to a modification of the virial theorem in order to compensate the incompleteness of the sample out to the virial radius .",
    "our estimated total mass of a2107 is @xmath192 ( without any correction ) .",
    "most importantly , reducing the effect of rotation we infer virial mass @xmath193 .",
    "the simplest way to get this virial mass is to estimate the velocity dispersion from the linear regression at positional angle @xmath45 .",
