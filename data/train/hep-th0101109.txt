    "this paper studies the perturbative aspects of spontaneous symmetry breaking in noncommutative gauge theories .",
    "non - commutative field theories have been the subject of great activity recently ( see , for example , references [ 1 - 34 ] ) , since being found to arise naturally in limits of string theory formulated in the presence of background gauge fields  @xcite .",
    "later works have treated non - commutative field theories as objects worthy of study independent of their string theory origins , a point of view adhered to in this paper .",
    "a hallmark of these theories is the mixing of uv and ir divergences  @xcite ; uv divergences in the commutative theory can become ir divergences in the noncommutative theory .",
    "this calls into question the renormalizability of non - commutative field theories .",
    "several papers have explicitly shown that such theories as @xmath3 and u(n ) gauge theories , when formulated on a non - commutative space , are one loop renormalizable  @xcite .",
    "however , results in the literature  @xcite have shown that non - commutativity renders impossible the continuum renormalization of the spontaneously broken linear sigma model .",
    "they find that goldstone s theorem is violated at the one loop level , and the goldstone mode obtains a mass dependent upon the theory s uv cutoff .",
    "the situtation in spontaneously broken gauge theories seems to also merit investigation , as both an interesting question and as a preface to any attempts to embed the standard model within a non - commutative framework . in particular ,",
    "the gauge dependence of the spontaneously broken theory should be checked , as the analog of the problem seen in  @xcite would be a gauge dependent shift of one of the masses in the theory . in this paper",
    "we examine the non - commutative abelian higgs model at the one - loop level .",
    "we work in an arbitrary @xmath4 gauge , and show that the resulting brst invariance of the action holds when one loop corrections are calculated by finding a counterterm set capable of removing the divergences from the 1pi functions .",
    "we find that the physical couplings and masses are gauge - independent . upon taking the gauge coupling to zero ,",
    "we obtain a continuum renormalization of the broken o(2 ) linear sigma model , contradicting the results in  @xcite .",
    "we show that the proper ordering of the nc generalization of @xmath5 term in the globally symmetric theory is that consistent with the local realization of the symmetry .",
    "we then summarize some of the properties of the theory , such as the beta functions for the various couplings and violations of the discrete symmetries @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 for certain types of non - commutativity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review the essential ideas of non - commutative ( nc ) field theory ; for a more detailed introduction the reader is referred to the references in the bibliography .",
    "section 3 reviews the commutative abelian higgs model , concentrating upon setting up the counterterm structure and upon defining gauge independent physical parameters .",
    "we discuss this in detail as similar definitions will be used when discussing the nc model . in section 4",
    "we construct the nc abelian higgs model , and show by explicit calculation that the theory is renormalizable .",
    "we present our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "the essential idea of ncqft is a generalization of the usual d - dimensional space , @xmath6 , associated with commuting space - time coordinates to one which is non - commuting , @xmath7 .",
    "in such a space the conventional coordinates are represented by operators which no longer commute : @xmath8=i\\theta_{\\mu\\nu},\\ ] ] where @xmath9 represents a real anti - symmetric matrix .",
    "ncqft can be phrased in terms of conventional commuting qft through the application of the weyl - moyal correspondence @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents a quantum field with @xmath12 being the set of non - commuting coordinates and @xmath13 corresponding to the commuting set . however , in formulating ncqft , one must be careful to preserve orderings in expressions such as @xmath14 .",
    "this is accomplished with the introduction of the moyal product , @xmath15 , where the effect of the commutation relation is absorbed into the cross . introducing the fourier",
    "transform pair @xmath16 with @xmath13 and @xmath17 being real n - dimensional variables , allows us to write the product of two fields as @xmath18}a(\\alpha)b(\\beta)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we thus have the correspondence @xmath19 provided we identify @xmath20_{\\zeta=\\eta=0}\\,.\\ ] ] note that propagators are identical on commutative and nc spaces because quadratic forms remain unchanged : @xmath21 since @xmath22 is antisymmetric .",
    "here we review the commutative abelian higgs model in some detail , as much of our construction will carry over into the non - commutative case .",
    "the commutative abelian higgs model begins with the lagrangian @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "this lagrangian is invariant under the gauge transformation @xmath25 the potential @xmath26=\\mu^2 \\left|\\phi \\right|^2 -\\frac{\\lambda}{6 } \\left|\\phi \\right|^4\\ ] ] has minima at @xmath27 expanding @xmath28 we arrive at the lagrangian @xmath29 the higgs field has acquired a mass @xmath30 , while the gauge boson has acquired a mass @xmath31 .",
    "we will work in an @xmath4 gauge , so to this we add the gauge fixing and ghost lagrangians @xmath32 which cancels the @xmath33 cross term .",
    "the feynman rules can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the total lagrangian @xmath34 is invariant under the brst transformation @xmath35    to study the renormalizability of the theory we define the following counterterms relating the bare and physical quantities : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a constant with dimensions of mass used to account for units in dimensional regularization .",
    "note that if we expand @xmath38 as before , we will no longer be expanding around the minimum of the potential ; the higgs tadpole will acquire a nonzero value .",
    "it is convenient , though unnecessary , to introduce a new counterterm @xmath39 , expand @xmath40 and fix @xmath39 by requiring the higgs tadpole to vanish .",
    "we could , if desired , refrain from introducing @xmath39 , and include the higgs tadpole in the calculation of other green s functions . depending upon the gauge in which we work ,",
    "@xmath39 will be uv divergent .",
    "although it may seem strange to be expanding the scalar field around an infinite gauge - dependent vev , the expansion point is not a physical obervable , so no contradiction arises .",
    "this procedure is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we now take the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( 8) , written in terms of bare quantities , and insert the physical quantities and counterterms , while expanding the field @xmath41 as in eq .",
    "our new lagrangian contains two pieces : the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( 12 ) written in terms of the physical parameters , and the counterterm lagrangian , which is used to subtract the divergences in the physical green s functions .",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression uses the fact that @xmath42 is already written in terms of the physical parameters and fields . to determine the counterterms for @xmath44",

    "( 9 ) written in terms of the unbroken fields , and expanding as in eq .",
    "( 16 ) , we arrive at the counterterm lagrangian @xmath45 the super - renormalizability of the higgs - ghost interaction means that we do not need to introduce a wave - function renormalization constant for the ghost field .",
    "the new lagrangian is invariant under a `` renormalized '' brst symmetry , which is identical to eq . ( 14 ) with @xmath46 in the @xmath47 transformation .",
    "the terms listed above illustrate the subtlety involved with the renormalization of spontaneously broken theories ; a limited number of counterterms are needed to subtract a large number of divergences .",
    "the above theory is renormalizable in spite of these difficulties .",
    "an explicit one loop calculation reveals the counterterms @xmath48 where @xmath49 can account for the one loop divergences in this theory , and we have used the minimal subtraction prescription .    in preparation for our discussion of the nc case ,",

    "the calculation of the physical couplings at various renormalization points is facilitated by finding their beta functions .",
    "we find the following values : @xmath51 these quantities are in agreement with those found in  @xcite .",
    "we can solve these differential equations to find the relations between physical couplings at various renormalization points ; for example , we find @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the coupling at the renormalization point @xmath54 .",
    "similarly for the masses , we have the following relations between bare and physical masses : @xmath55 note that @xmath56 ; @xmath39 just defines the shift of the expansion point , and does not enter this expression .",
    "we can check that these lead to gauge independent definitions of the physical masses ; calculation yields @xmath57 \\nonumber \\\\ m^2 & = & m_{b}^2 \\left [ 1 + \\frac { \\lambda}{8 \\pi^2 \\epsilon } - \\frac{5 g^2}{12 \\pi^2 \\epsilon } + \\frac{9 g^4}{4 \\pi^2 \\lambda \\epsilon } \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the bare masses are infinite in order to cancel the @xmath58 poles .",
    "the important point is the gauge independence of these results ; we will find that the same definitions of the physical parameters give gauge independent results in the nc theory .",
    "we now examine the non - commutative extension of the abelian higgs model , following the procedure introduced in the previous section .",
    "non - commutative u(1 ) gauge theory coupled to a complex scalar field is defined by the lagrangian @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 . with @xmath62 ,",

    "we would also like to point out that our expressions for individual diagrams agree with  @xcite when applicable .",
    "an interesting feature of these results is that individual diagrams were not necessarily proportional to the momentum dependent phase present in the vertices .",
    "this is particularly striking in the @xmath129 vertex ; it contains a very non - trivial lorentz index and phase factor structure , and receives contributions from a very large number of diagrams , none of which are proportional to the necessary factor .",
    "this point was also emphasized in  @xcite , who found the same behavior in pure nc u(n ) gauge theories in arbitrary lorentz gauges .",
    "there are a very limited number of renormalization constants that must account for a large number of divergences ; we find , however , that the following set suffices : @xmath130 the relations between the divergent pieces of the 1pi functions established by the brst symmetry of eq .",

    ".    we can also use these results to discuss spontaneously broken global symmetries in nc field theories . upon removing the gauge field and gauge - scalar couplings from our lagrangian , and making the gauge transformation global ,",
    "we are left with the broken o(2 ) linear sigma model .",
    "the remaining renormalization constants are @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 ( with @xmath135 ) ; the familiar wave - function , mass , and coupling constant renormalizations that are found in textbooks  @xcite .",
    "our results show that the continuum renormalization of this model is possible , contradicting results found in  @xcite . while in the case of global symmetries both",
    "nc generalizations of @xmath136 discussed below eq .",
    "( 25 ) are consistent with the symmetry , our result indicates that the proper ordering is the one also consistent with a local realization of the symmetry .",
    "this is the only choice that leads to a one - loop renormalizable theory .",
    "we imagine that such considerations in choosing non - commutative extensions of commutative interactions hold generally .",
    "we have found that the relations between counterterms which are necessary to renormalize spontaneously broken u(1 ) gauge theory occur in the noncommutative version of the theory ; the brst symmetry of the lagrangian holds at the one - loop level . upon taking the gauge field couplings to zero",
    "we obtain a consistent continuum renormalization of the broken o(2 ) linear sigma model , in disagreement with  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . in the o(2 ) linear sigma model , both nc generalizations of the @xmath137 preserves the symmetry ; however , renormalization requires us to pick the one also consistent with the local symmetry .",
    "we are not familiar with any discussions in the literature regarding how to choose nc extensions of commutative actions when some symmetry does not dictate a choice .",
    "however , we believe that the problem of ordering ambiguities arising from nc extensions of global symmetries can be solved by demanding that the local symmetry also hold .",
    "note that this would nt have dictated a choice of scalar potential in  @xcite , as either @xmath138 generalization is consistent when working in the adjoint representation .",
    "we have only discussed a single simple case in this paper , that of a u(1 ) nc gauge theory coupled to a complex scalar field in the fundamental representation .",
    "important generalizations are to consider different scalar representations , fermion contributions , and arbitrary u(n ) groups . while we have nothing to say about the first two , we believe that the generalization to u(n ) will be successful .",
    "the remarkable interplay between diagrams required to renormalize the @xmath129 vertex , seen here in the scalar sector and in the gauge sector for general u(n ) in  @xcite seems to indicate the consistency of these models .",
    "the work in this paper should be regarded as a `` proof of principle '' that spontaneously broken nc gauge theories are consistent .",
    "the non - commutativity of space - time at small scales is an exciting possible modification of fundamental physics .",
    "our result provides a step towards a nc version of the standard model ; the work in  @xcite , and the presence of tree level cp violation noted here and in  @xcite , indicates that it might lead to interesting physics .",
    "hopefully this paper will direct interest towards exploring this route .",
