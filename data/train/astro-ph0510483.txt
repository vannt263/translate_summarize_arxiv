    "shortly after the discovery of radio millisecond pulsars , it was hypothesized that the neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) were rotating at hundreds of revolutions per second and are the progenitors of radio millisecond pulsars @xcite .",
    "the presence of rapidly rotating neutron stars in lmxbs was not conclusively established until the discovery of coherent millisecond pulsations from lmxbs @xcite .",
    "this discovery has greatly advanced our understanding of these systems .",
    "the unambiguous measurement of neutron star spin periods was essential in definitely establishing that the quasiperiodic oscillations found in thermonuclear x - ray bursts @xcite are linked to the neutron star spin .",
    "the highly accurate measurements enabled by the stability of the neutron star spin have enabled the most accurate measurements of the orbital properties of lmxbs .",
    "spectral analysis of the pulse profiles has the potential to constrain the mass / radius relation of neutron stars and therefore the equation of state of nuclear matter @xcite .    however , the sample of millisecond pulsars is small . increasing the sample of millisecond",
    "x - ray pulsars is essential to enable population studies of these systems which should shed light on the properties of neutron - star x - ray binaries , their evolution , and their relation to millisecond radio pulsars . here",
    ", we describe observations made with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ; bradt , rothschild , & swank 1993 ) of a new transient x - ray source that we find to be a millisecond x - ray pulsar : hete j1900.1 - 2455 @xcite . we describe our observations in  2 , our results on the detection of pulsations and the measurement of the orbital parameters in  3 , and conclude in  4 with a few comments on the nature of the system and the population of neutron - star lmxbs .",
    "on 2005 june 14 , a bright x - ray burst was detected @xcite with the high energy transient explorer 2 ( hete-2 ) @xcite .",
    "the burst was clearly a type i x - ray burst with radius expansion .",
    "a detection in the hete-2 soft x - ray camera ( sxc ) @xcite localized the burst to an @xmath2 accuracy .",
    "no known x - ray burst source was consistent with the sxc position . assuming that the burst luminosity is equal to the eddington limit for a @xmath3 neutron - star burning helium , @xcite estimate the distance as 5  kpc .",
    "following discovery of the source , we triggered an rxte target - of - opportunity observing program which led to multiple observations on dates from 2005 june 16 to july 16 ( mjd 53537 to 53567 ) .",
    "the first few rxte pointed observations led to the detection of pulsations at 377.3  hz @xcite and further rxte observations enabled an initial measurement of the orbital parameters @xcite .",
    "a position was determined from rxte scanning observations @xcite and then a possible optical counterpart was identified @xcite . the optical counterpart was confirmed with further optical observations which showed that the source was bright compared with archival plates , blue in color , and emits a broad he ii emission line @xcite .",
    "an improved x - ray position , accurate to @xmath4 , and consistent with that of the optical counterpart was obtained with the swift x - ray telescope @xcite .",
    "vla observations were performed , but no radio counterpart was detected @xcite .    for the rxte observations , we analyzed data from the proportional counter array ( pca ) .",
    "the first observation used two single bit modes , sb_125us_8_13_1s and sb_125us_14_35_1s , and an event mode , e_16us_16b_36_1s , to provide high resolution timing .",
    "the subsequent observations used a single event mode , e_125us_64m_0_1s , for high resolution timing . for all observations , the standard-1 low - resolution ( 0.125  s ) timing mode and",
    "the standard-2 spectroscopic mode with 16  s time resolution were available .    a light curve derived from the pca standard-2 data",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "we used only data from pcu2 because this pcu was on during all of the observations and followed the analysis procedures described in @xcite .",
    "a spectrum was extracted for each individual observation .",
    "we assign a 1% systematic uncertainty on each spectral bin @xcite .",
    "we fit the spectra to a model consisting of the sum of a power - law and a black body with interstellar absorption .",
    "we fixed the absorption column density to @xmath5 which is the galactic hi column density along the line of sight .",
    "the source has a galactic latitude of @xmath6 and lies 1.1  kpc out of the plane if at a distance of 5  kpc .",
    "therefore , the galactic hi should mainly lie between us and the source .",
    "the discovery x - ray burst occurred on 2005 june 14 ( mjd 53535 ) .",
    "the first rxte pointing occurred 2 days later and shows the source at a flux of @xmath7 .",
    "the source flux increases gradually over the beginning of the outburst , there is one observation with a high flux at mjd 53559 , and subsequently the source flux decays .",
    "the photon index gradually softens , while the blackbody temperature gradually increases , until a few days after the peak flux when the trends reverse .",
    "the first two observations may have had softer and cooler spectra , but the uncertainties in the spectral fitting do not permit any firm conclusions in this regard .",
    "we find temperatures higher than those reported by @xcite .",
    "we do find that addition of a lower temperature blackbody improves the fit in some cases .",
    "the true spectrum of hete j1900.1 - 2455 may include two blackbody components , as has been suggested for other millisecond pulsars @xcite .",
    "the spectral model described above was inadequate in fitting the high flux point because that spectrum shows distinct curvature at high energies . at energies below 14  kev ,",
    "the spectrum lies above those from the previous or subsequent day , while at energies above 14  kev , the spectrum lies below . to fit that spectrum , we added a high energy exponential cutoff and removed the black body component .",
    "the resulting spectral model is the same as that commonly used for standard x - ray pulsars , i.e.  those with spin periods of 1 - 1000  s @xcite .",
    "the photon index was @xmath8 , the cutoff energy was @xmath9 , and the folding energy was @xmath10 .",
    "the cutoff energy is similar to that found for the x - ray pulsars gs 1843 + 00 @xcite and smc  x-1 @xcite , but the photon index is softer than found for those or other standard accreting x - ray pulsars .",
    "we attempted to fit the spectrum with a blackbody , the sum of a blackbody plus a power - law , and the sum of two blackbodies and a power - law , all with absorption , but were unable to obtain good fits with any of these models .",
    "the rxte / asm light curve does not show unusually high flux near this time .",
    "the average rate around mjd 53559 is close to 3  c / s , equivalent to roughly @xmath11 in the 2 - 20 kev band .",
    "it appears unlikely that the high flux point is part of a superburst .",
    "we examined the light curve of this observation on time scales of 1 , 8 and 64  s. the light curve shows no usual variability on these time scales , but does show a kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillation ( khz qpo ) .",
    "we searched for high frequency qpos in each uninterrupted rxte observation window and in combinations of the various data segments .",
    "we calculated averages of 16  s power spectra including events with energies below 18  kev from all pcus .",
    "a single khz qpo appears in the observation beginning mjd 53559.447583 , see fig .",
    "[ khzqpo ] .",
    "the detection has a significance of @xmath12 , with no allowance for trials .",
    "even allowing for @xmath13 trials for all of the distinct frequency ranges in all the power spectra generated , the detection is still highly significant .",
    "the qpo has a centroid of @xmath14 , a width of @xmath15 , and an rms amplitude of @xmath16 .",
    "there is no evidence for qpos at plus or minus the spin frequency or at plus or minus half the spin frequency away from the single khz qpo .",
    "we used the standard-1 data which has 0.125  s time resolution and no energy information to search for x - ray bursts .",
    "we found one burst - like event at mjd 53538.76433 .",
    "however , this event appears to be a detector breakdown event and not an x - ray burst from the source .",
    "hete-2 has reported only one additional x - ray burst on the hete burst summary page after the discovery burst .",
    "the additional burst was on mjd 53558 , just before the point in the light curve with a high flux .",
    "we examined the rxte all - sky monitor ( asm ) light curve for hete j1900.1 - 2455 .",
    "the only detection is of the current outburst .",
    "therefore , the recurrence time of the transient is likely longer than 9  years .",

    "our discovery of coherent millisecond pulsations from hete j1900.1 - 2455 adds another to the six previously known x - ray millisecond pulsars ( xmsps ) .",
    "as now appears typical for xmsps , the mass function for the pulsar is very small , @xmath24 , implying either a very low mass companion or a very improbable orbital inclination .",
    "the minimum companion mass , assuming a neutron star mass of @xmath25 and an orbital inclination @xmath26 , is @xmath27 .",

    "the points at which the stellar mass - radius relations intersect the mass - radius curve of the companion star indicate possible stellar companions allowed by the observations .",
    "in contrast to other xmsps , there are possible roche - lobe filling companion stars with standard evolutionary histories .",
    "therefore , heating of the companion star , as suggested for sax j1808.4 - 3658 @xcite , is not required to expand the companion s radius and drive mass transfer in hete j1900.1 - 2455 .",
    "the companion star is likely a brown dwarf .",
    "one very unusual aspect of our observations of hete j1900.1 - 2455 is the detection of a dramatic brightening of the source on mjd 53559 , accompanied by a shift in the pulse frequency with @xmath31 and then the suppression of pulsations in subsequent observations . during the interval of high flux ,",
    "the x - ray spectrum is exponentially cutoff at high energies , as is seen for standard x - ray pulsars , where the accretion spot is thought to be quite compact .",
    "what mechanism is responsible for the suppression of pulsations after the high x - ray flux interval is an open question .",
    "diamagnetic screening of the magnetic field , a change in the accretion geometry , or enhanced scattering of the pulses due to accumulation of material around the poles are possibilities .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have good information concerning the total fluence in the high flux event .",
    "however , the high flux point corresponds to a luminosity of only 1.5% of the eddington luminosity , assuming that the eddington luminosity is given by the bolometric flux of @xmath32 reported for the discovery x - ray burst by @xcite .",
    "@xcite state that diamagnetic screening of the magnetic field is not possible for accretion rates below 2% of the eddington rate , which may exclude this possibility .",
    "in addition to the xmsps , the spin periods of neutron stars in x - ray binaries can be measured via the detection of ( quasiperiodic ) oscillations in type i x - ray bursts .",

    ", we refer to this plot as a ` milli - corbet ' diagram .",
    "there are apparent bounds on the data points at low spin period and at low orbital period .",
    "the origin of the apparent lower bound on the orbital period , and the clustering of sources near this limit of 40  min , is a puzzle .",
    "there are lmxbs with shorter orbital periods , but the neutron star spin frequency has not been definitively measured in any of those systems . the lower bound on the spin period distribution has been interpreted as evidence that gravitational radiation losses limit the maximum accretion torque spinning up neutron stars in lmxbs @xcite . the longest spin period , for exo 0748 - 676 , is a factor of 4 larger than the second longest .",
    "the unusually slow spin may be due to an unusually high magnetic field @xcite .",
    "if we consider the neutron stars with spin rates faster than 100  hz , there appears to be a lack of points with long spin periods and long orbital periods . excluding exo 0748 - 676",
    ", the linear correlation coefficient between the logarithms of the spin and orbital periods is @xmath33 which has a chance probability of occurrence of 2.5% .",
    "this correlation may indicate some coupling between the neutron spin and orbital period , perhaps indirectly if the mass accretion rate varies with orbital period .",
    "why exo 0748 - 676 differs so significantly from the behavior of the more rapidly rotating neutron stars would need to be understood .",
    "the discovery of more millisecond pulsars , or the measurement of the orbital periods of additional x - ray burst oscillation sources , is needed to better understand the evolution of neutron star spin in low - mass x - ray binaries .",
