    "theoretically quantum computers can perform some types of calculations much faster than classical computers @xcite , but the technological difficulties of manipulating quantum information have so far prevented researchers from constructing a quantum computer which is able to perform useful tasks .",
    "the difficulty of building a quantum computer was greatly diminished when it was realized that a network of quantum phase gates ( qpg ) operating in the product space of two qubits , single bit rotations , and single bit phase shift gates can constitute a universal quantum computer @xcite .",
    "the qpg simply gives the product state of two qubits a phase shift depending on the values of each qubit .",
    "in other words , the qpg performs the operation @xmath0",
    "\\begin{array}{l }         provided that @xmath1 ( mod @xmath2 ) a network of qpgs supplemented with single bit gates can mimic the operation of any other unitary operator acting on the qubits .",
    "recently an implementation of a qpg has been demonstrated @xcite utilizing rydberg states and a photon in a microwave cavity . in this letter",
    "we explain how a qpg that operates in the product space of the polarizations of two photons can be constructed by using the optical kerr effect .",
    "the photons are made to interact as they pass through a material with a third - order nonlinear susceptibility .",
    "these kerr materials are used for a wide variety of optical applications . in the presence of a superposition of electromagnetic waves at different frequencies and/or in different directions ,",
    "these materials are used in four - wave mixing applications such as frequency conversion , phase conjugation , real time holography , and image correlation . in the presence of a wave at a single frequency ,",
    "the refractive index of such materials is intensity dependent and gives rise to the phenomenon of self focusing @xcite .",
    "when a superposition of waves is present , the optical kerr effect also produces an interaction in which the intensity of one frequency component influences the index of refraction of another frequency component . as described by mandel and wolf in @xcite , this effect can be used to perform quantum non - demolition and back - action evading measurements , during which the intensity of one frequency component can be used to control the phase of another without altering the photon number of either component . thus without loss of photon number , the frequency components can become entangled in a way that lends itself well to quantum computations .",
    "because a photon s polarization state can be easily manipulated with devices like faraday rotators and quarter - wave plates , we take our qubit to be a single state @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are complex numbers @xcite , with @xmath6 we implement this as the elliptical polarization of a beam of light , so that the @xmath7 and @xmath8 eigenstates correspond to horizontal and vertical polarized modes of the photon field of a particular frequency .",
    "other all optical qubit implementations have represented qubits with the paths that a laser travels through an interferometer , and the computation is performed using interference .",
    "although it is easy to construct a small quantum computer using this method , the number of optical components ( beam splitters and mirrors ) increases exponentially with the number of qubits in the computer @xcite .",
    "because our proposal encodes the qubits with polarization rather than interferometer paths , it does not suffer from this exponential growth .",
    "the photon characterizing the first qubit @xmath9 has frequency @xmath10 , and the second qubit @xmath11 has frequency @xmath12 . in order to increase the effectiveness of the nonlinear medium that will carry out the qpg operation",
    ", the two photons should travel through it colinearly .",
    "the computer s information is encoded in the photons polarizations , so the photon frequency is the only means by which we can distinguish the two qubits .",
    "the electric field operator that acts on the photons traveling through the qpg is given by @xcite @xmath13\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is time @xmath15 is the coordinate describing the direction of propagation , @xmath16 is the normalization volume , @xmath17 represents each qubit , @xmath18 represents the polarization , @xmath19 is the permittivity of free space , @xmath20 is the annihilation operator and @xmath21 is the creation operator of a photon with frequency @xmath22 and polarization @xmath18 , the @xmath23 are unit polarization vectors , and @xmath24 is the wave number of qubit @xmath17 .",
    "an optical medium exhibiting the frequency independent kerr effect is governed by a nonlinear polarization vector with components @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the linear component of the susceptibility , and @xmath27 is third order nonlinear response to the electric field , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , represent the three spatial directions @xcite .",
    "a frequency dependent @xmath32 can not be factored so simply but can be expressed through the fourier transforms of @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the electric fields representing the two qubits as they travel through the kerr medium is given by the hamiltonian @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the permeability of the non - magnetic material , @xmath37 is the total magnetic field , and @xmath38 is the nonlinear part of the polarization vector including frequency dependent terms .    we may simplify this complicated hamiltonian by choosing the two frequencies of the electric fields to be nearly resonant with excitations of the medium as pictured in fig .",
    "[ transitions ] @xcite .",
    "exactly resonant photons will suffer from loss , so it is best that they are slightly detuned .",
    "a similar technique , with a different energy transition scheme , has been demonstrated by sinatra et .",
    "al .  in @xcite . in their experiment the two lasers are coupled through a gas of @xmath39 where the photons interact with a @xmath40-type three - level system . if the photon frequencies are chosen correctly many of the terms in the above hamiltonian can be ignored . upon substituting the operator forms of the fields we obtain @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the linear permittivity of the medium",
    ", @xmath43 is the only surviving frequency dependent term in the nonlinear susceptibility , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the photon number operators .    as the photons pass through the kerr medium , they will experience some phase shift , which can be calculated from the time evolution of the annihilation operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 . using heisenberg s equation of motion ,",
    "we find that @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "therefore each photon field traveling through the kerr medium will receive a phase shift that depends on the number of photons in the other field . more specifically ,",
    "if one field is in a superposition of photon number states , the other field will emerge in an entangled state so that it has been given a superposition of different phase shifts .",
    "it is relatively easy to manipulate the polarization states of a photon , so we imagine that the quantum computer contains two photons with the states @xmath51 and @xmath52 however the phase shifts provided by the isotropic kerr effect depend not on polarization , but instead on photon number , so we must translate the above polarization states into fock states . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ device ] , this can be done by passing each photon through a polarizing beam splitter effectively cutting each qubit into two beams , one with horizontal and one with vertical polarization .",
    "the amplitudes for finding zero or one photon in each beam are given by @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 and @xmath56    the two horizontal beams may now be deflected around the kerr medium while the vertical beams are directed through it . to achieve the largest nonlinear effects",
    ", we combine the two vertical beams with prisms so that they are collinear when entering the medium .",
    "prisms may also be used to separate the beams after they emerge .",
    "we assume that the horizontal beams travel for an integer number of wavelengths and receive zero phase shift , while the two vertical beams are phase shifted according to the operators @xmath57 and @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 count the number of photons in @xmath61 and @xmath62 . after emerging from the kerr medium the vertical parts of the two qubits are @xmath63 and @xmath64    the horizontal and vertical parts of the qubits are then recombined at a second pair of polarizing beam splitters , completing the action of the quantum phase gate .",
    "if the kerr medium is anisotropic , it may not be necessary to split the beams into horizontal and vertical parts .",
    "instead the beams would be `` split '' by the medium so that their horizontal and vertical components receive different phase shifts .",
    "the output qubits are @xmath65 and @xmath66 this is equivalent to the operation of @xmath67   \\begin{array}{l }         @xmath68 . for correct choices of the parameters @xmath10 , @xmath12 , @xmath14 ( or the length of the kerr medium ) , and @xmath43 ,",
    "this is a quantum phase gate satisfying the conditions for universality .",
    "decoherence afflicts all physical implementations of quantum computers , and in this implementation of the qpg , decoherence will mainly come about through the loss of photons . in general the outcome of an interaction with a quantum state",
    "is not unique . in most cases the alternate outcomes",
    "remove probability from the signal of interest and lead to erratic outcomes when it is measured .",
    "our concept calls for polarization sensitive phase shifts .",
    "but the nonlinear process responsible for the phase shift can have other outcomes too .",
    "one needs to have a reasonably large portion of the total interaction rate produce the gated phase shift and to have an ability to reject all the alternate outcomes . in some experiments ,",
    "this has been accomplished through the use of single mode fiber @xcite that only permits the propagation of the , possibly phase shifted , initial wave .",
    "one might also consider the use of filters to remove higher and lower frequencies produced by the nonlinear interaction .",
    "as long as the information present in the photons survives the interactions with the gate the device will function properly .",
    "we can imagine that in most calculations , a quantum computer would compute from one polarization eigenstate to another eigenstate .",
    "this fact suggests a method for guarding against mistakes due to photon loss . at the output stage of the computer we should have photo - detectors prepared to measure the presence of each photon in both of its @xmath7 and @xmath8 states .",
    "exactly one of the two photo - detectors should register a photon , so if zero or two photons are measured , the calculation should be repeated .",
    "unfortunately the probability of finding an error increases exponentially with the number of qubits that the computer contains .",
    "suppose that @xmath69 is the probability that a single qubit survives all of the computational operations and is correctly detected by its detectors .",
    "@xmath69 is likely to be very small for a computer with many qubits and quantum logic gates .",
    "if we assume that all @xmath70 photons must pass through the same number of logic gates and that @xmath69 is not a function of the polarization of the qubits , he probability that all @xmath70 photons survive the computation and are all detected correctly is then @xmath71 .",
    "the optical kerr effect depends on the number of photons in the two waves .",
    "the induced phase shift is proportional to the intensity of the controlling beam .",
    "optical losses can reduce the intensity of the beams and change the phase shift associated with the interaction .",
    "one needs a simple way to generate a standard amplitude beam as part of the gate so that the induced phase shift will be a constant .",
    "here we assume that the quantum computer operates at the single photon level , so losses are detected by the absence of an output for the particular qubit .",
    "an intrinsic problem with our approach may be the presence of polarization dependent loses that would make the induced phase shifts depend on the `` state '' of the qubit . while these may be small , they introduce a form of error into the gate that could accumulate for complex calculations",
    ". it may be possible to compensate for these effects .",
    "in general it may be hard to maintain ridged control on the mechanical structure of the gate to ensure reproduceability . without control",
    "the gate will populate a small region in the vicinity of the correct operation .",
    "we suspect that some sort of feedback mechanism may be needed to insure consistent quality for extended calculations .",
    "lastly , for most materials the @xmath27 are known to be very small , and nonlinear effects are observable only for beams with large numbers of photons .",
    "one can combat this by allowing the photons to travel together through long fibers @xcite",
    ". however , large nonlinear effects exist for photons slightly detuned from resonance transitions in atomic gasses @xcite .",
    "the photon - photon interaction predicted from the kerr effect hamiltonian is the sort of interaction required for the construction of a universal quantum computer . at the single - photon level , this implementation of a qpg is sensitive to loss mechanisms and the requirement of large nonlinear optical effects .",
    "our future work will investigate the extension of this treatment to qubits that are described by large numbers of photons rather than single photons .",
