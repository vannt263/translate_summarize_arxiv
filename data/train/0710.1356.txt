    "the fermion hubbard hamiltonian @xcite , originally proposed to describe the physics of transition metal monoxides feo , mno , and coo , has been widely used as a model of cuprate superconductors , whose undoped parent compounds , like la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , are also antiferromagnetic and insulating . indeed , early quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations of the hubbard hamiltonian suggested that d - wave pairing was the dominant superconducting instability@xcite , a symmetry which was subsequently observed in the cuprates@xcite . however , the sign problem precluded any definitive statement about a phase transition to a d - wave superconducting phase@xcite . over the last several years , qmc studies within dynamical mean field theory and its cluster generalization @xcite are presenting a more compelling case for this transition .",
    "the existence of charge inhomogeneities in hartree - fock @xcite and density matrix renormalization group treatments@xcite , along with the experimental observation of such patterns @xcite , offer further indications that significant aspects of the qualitative physics of the cuprates might be contained in the hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "nevertheless , there are a number of features of high temperature superconductors which do not completely fit within the framework of the single band hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "for example , the cuprate gap is set by the charge transfer energy separating the copper @xmath3 and oxygen @xmath4 orbitals @xcite as opposed to a mott gap between copper @xmath3 states split by the on - site repulsion .",
    "considerable evidence for the possible important role of phonon modes in aspects of the physics is available@xcite .",
    "hirsch has emphasized the asymmetry in transition temperatures , and other properties , between the electron and hole doped cuprates as a reason to consider more general models , since the particle - hole symmetry of the single band hubbard hamiltonian requires that its behavior be rigorously identical for fillings @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "partially motivated by this asymmetry , he introduced @xcite the dynamic hubbard hamiltonian , @xmath7 .",
    "\\label{hamilton}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the first term , involving the fermion creation ( destruction ) operators @xmath8 at site @xmath9 with spin @xmath10 , is the tight binding kinetic energy describing the hopping of electrons between near neighbor sites .",
    "we consider here a two - dimensional square lattice and chose @xmath11 to set our scale of energy .",
    "the on - site interaction energy differs from the usual static hubbard hamiltonian in that its value @xmath12 is modulated by a dynamic field @xmath13 which can take the values @xmath14 . as a consequence the on - site repulsion @xmath12 has bimodal values @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this dynamic field itself has non - trivial quantum fluctuations controlled by the relative values of the longitudinal and transverse frequencies @xmath17 and @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath13 are pauli matrices@xcite .",
    "the variation in @xmath12 , hirsch argued , has its physical origin in the relaxation which occurs with multiple occupation of an atomic orbital .",
    "hirsch and collaborators have studied the physics of eq .",
    "[ hamilton ] with a variety of methods , including a lang - firsov transformation ( lft)@xcite , exact diagonalization ( ed ) of small clusters@xcite , and world - line quantum monte carlo ( wlqmc ) @xcite in one dimension @xcite . within the lft",
    "it is seen that the hopping of electrons is renormalized by the overlap of the states of the dynamic variable on neighboring lattice sites .",
    "superconductivity then arises because isolated holes are essentially localized by a small overlap , whereas holes that are on the same or neighboring sites can move around the lattice .",
    "furthermore this effect is operative for holes in a nearly filled system , but not electrons in a nearly empty lattice .",
    "thus pairing is linked to the presence of holes , and the physics is manifestly not particle - hole symmetric .",
    "ed provided quantitative values for the overlaps and confirmed the picture based on the lft on small clusters .",
    "ed also allows for the evaluation of the ` binding energy ' , @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 is the ground state energy of a cluster with @xmath22 electrons .",
    "a negative @xmath23 indicates that it is energetically favorable to put two particles together on a single cluster rather than separate them on two different clusters . on a sufficiently large lattice",
    ", two particles would tend to be close spatially rather than widely separated . in fig .",
    "[ hirschcheck1 ] we show an evaluation of @xmath23 on a 2x2 lattice .",
    "these numbers were obtained independently from , but are identical to , those of ref .  .",
    "as the coupling @xmath24 to the dynamic field increases , @xmath23 is driven negative , indicating the possibility of binding of particles and hence superconductivity .",
    "wlqmc simulations in one dimension confirmed this real space pairing by explicitly showing the preference of the world lines of holes to propagate next to each other and a large gain in kinetic energy when the hole - hole separation becomes small .",
    "significantly , these simulations also showed that the kinetic energy disfavors proximity of holes in the holstein model , which also features the tendency of holes to clump together by distorting a local phonon degree of freedom . thus pairing in the dynamic hubbard model",
    "is distinguished from that of more traditional electron - phonon models by being driven by the kinetic energy as opposed to a potential energy .    in this paper",
    "we examine the properties of the dynamic hubbard hamiltonian with determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc)@xcite . this approach allows us to work in two dimensions , as opposed to previous ( @xmath25 ) wlqmc studies , and also to examine lattices of an order of magnitude greater number of sites than ed . on the other hand ,",
    "the ability of dqmc to reach low temperatures is limited by the sign problem@xcite .",
    "we find that the extended @xmath0-wave pairing vertex , which is repulsive in the static hubbard model , is attractive in the dynamic model , that is , extended @xmath0-wave superconducting correlations are enhanced by the dynamic fluctuations .",
    "however , the pairing susceptibilities are still only rather weakly increasing down to the lowest temperatures accessible to us ( temperature @xmath26 greater than 1/40 the electronic bandwidth ) .",
    "we also find , near half - filling , that the antiferromagnetic correlations can be enhanced relative to the static hubbard hamiltonian , particularly for densities _ above _ @xmath27 .",
    "the mott gap can also be stabilized .",
    "interestingly , the total energy appears to be close to linear in the particle density , as opposed to a clear concave up curvature in the static hubbard model ( with either repulsive or attractive interactions ) .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in the next section we present our computational method , dqmc , as it applies to the dynamic hubbard model .",
    "we describe several minor adjustments to the dqmc algorithm for the static hubbard model that are needed in order to study the dynamic model .",
    "our observables are also defined . in section iii",
    ", we present the results from our monte carlo simulations .",
    "the topics of antiferromagnetism and the mott transition , pair susceptibilities and superconductivity , and the energy characteristics of the dynamic hubbard model are discussed .",
    "the paper closes with conclusions in section iv .",
    "although he did not undertake such studies , hirsch pointed out @xcite that the dynamic hubbard model could be simulated with a relatively minor modification of the dqmc method@xcite . in dqmc , an auxiliary ` hubbard - stratonovich ' ( hs ) field",
    "is introduced to decouple the on - site hubbard repulsion .",
    "the trace over the resulting quadratic form of fermion operators is performed analytically , leaving an expression for the partition function which is a sum over the hs variables whose weight is given by the product of two determinants , one for spin up and one for spin down , that are produced by evaluating the trace .    in dqmc for the usual hubbard hamiltonian , the hs field couples to the difference between the up and down spin electron densities , with a coupling constant which is independent of spatial site and imaginary time . in a simulation of the dynamic hubbard model ,",
    "the coupling of the hs field depends on the dynamic field @xmath28 .",
    "the imaginary time dependence arises from the transverse term @xmath19 in the hamiltonian .",
    "when the path integral for the partition function is constructed @xmath19 induces flips between the two values @xmath29 , so this quantity becomes dependent on @xmath30 . as a consequence",
    ", minor modifications are required to the standard expressions @xcite for the ratio of determinants before and after the monte carlo move of a hs variable , and for the re - evaluation of the green s function .",
    "the dynamic field variables must also be updated , and again , only minor modifications of the formulae for the determinant ratio and green s function update are required .",
    "a final difference is that there is a contribution to the weight coming from the @xmath31 and @xmath32 terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "the former try to align the dynamic variables in the imaginary time direction , while the latter favor positive values of the dynamic field .",
    "such pieces of the action , which enter the weight of the configuration along with the fermion determinants , are similar to those arising in simulations of the holstein hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "we verified our dqmc code by comparing to exact diagonalization results on a 2x2 spatial lattice ( figs .",
    "[ hirschcheck1],[sdcheck ] ) , and also by checking analytically soluble limits such as @xmath33 .",
    "the results of our dqmc / diagonalization calculations on 2x2 lattices are completely consistent with those of hirsch .",
    "for example , we have quantitatively reproduced the binding energy plot , fig .",
    "1(top ) of ref .   and our fig .",
    "[ hirschcheck1 ] . as a further check , we compared dqmc results for the double occupancy , @xmath34 , and the expectation value of the dynamic field , @xmath35 , to results from ed .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ sdcheck ] .",
    "we did not observe any major difference in the characteristics of the dqmc algorithm in simulating the dynamic hubbard model : autocorrelation times remain short , as is typically the case with dqmc , and there was no major change in the numerical stability @xcite .",
    "the key issue in dqmc is the ` sign problem ' which we will discuss in the following sections .",
    "dqmc allows us to measure any observable which can be expressed as an expectation value of products of creation and destruction operators .",
    "our measurements include the energy @xmath36 ( not including the chemical potential term ) , particle density @xmath37 , and green s function @xmath38 , as well as the average of the dynamic field @xmath39 .",
    "the dependence of the density on the chemical potential @xmath40 and the green s function , when analytically continued to the spectral function , allows us to examine , among other things , the mott metal - insulator transition .",
    "in addition to these single particle properties we also examine magnetic correlations , and specifically , the magnetic structure factor , @xmath41 our focus will be on the antiferromagnetic response , @xmath42 .",
    "we look at superconductivity by computing the correlated pair field susceptibility , @xmath43 , in different symmetry channels , @xmath44 these quantities can also be expressed in real space , @xmath45    the correlated susceptibility @xmath46 takes the expectation value of the product of the four fermion operators entering eq .",
    "we also define the uncorrelated pair field susceptibility @xmath47 which instead computes the expectation values of pairs of operators _ prior _ to taking the product .",
    "thus , for example , in the @xmath0-wave channel , @xmath48 @xmath46 includes both the renormalization of the propagation of the individual fermions as well as the interaction vertex between them , whereas @xmath47 includes only the former effect .",
    "indeed by evaluating both @xmath49 and @xmath50 we are able to extract @xcite the interaction vertex @xmath51 , @xmath52 if @xmath53 , the associated pairing interaction is attractive .",
    "@xmath54 signals a superconducting instability .",
    "it is useful to begin our study of the dynamic hubbard model by understanding the behavior of the dynamic field at different fillings ( fig .",
    "[ sigmaxzwz ] ) . for fillings below one particle per site , @xmath55 , the dynamic field @xmath56",
    "because of the coupling to the external field@xmath57 hence the interaction @xmath58 and the double occupancy is reduced . however , once double occupancy is unavoidable ( @xmath59 , the interaction term strongly favors @xmath60 .",
    "[ sigmaxzwz ] shows that this evolution from negative to positive values is nearly linear once @xmath61 .",
    "meanwhile , the expectation value of @xmath19 measures the fluctuations of @xmath13 in imaginary time .",
    "it is not surprising , then , that this quantity exhibits a maximum at roughly the midpoint between the evolution from @xmath62 to @xmath63 , at @xmath64 . in the results of fig .",
    "[ sigmaxzwz ] , and throughout this paper unless otherwise stated , the simulations were performed on 6x6 lattices .",
    "next , we compare the mott gap and magnetic correlations in the static and dynamic hubbard models . in fig .",
    "[ murhobis ] we plot the density @xmath65 as a function of chemical potential @xmath40 .",
    "a plateau at @xmath27 indicates the formation of a mott insulator .",
    "the cost to add a particle suddenly jumps by @xmath12 because additional particles are forced to sit on sites which are already occupied . at the inverse temperature chosen , @xmath66 , for the static hubbard model , the plateau is only beginning to develop .",
    "however for the dynamic model the plateau is much more robust .",
    "this is expected since near half - filling , as we have seen , the on - site repulsion mostly takes on its maximum value @xmath67 , for the parameters in fig .",
    "[ murhobis ] .",
    "we have chosen dynamic hubbard parameters @xmath24 and @xmath18 which gets the system as close as possible to the most attractive ( negative ) binding energy @xmath23 while still having @xmath68 .",
    "figure  [ murho ] gives further insight into the behavior of the density near full filling . in the static model ,",
    "the cost to add particles to the system is set by the on - site @xmath12 ( in the case that @xmath12 exceeds the bandwidth @xmath69 ) .",
    "however , in the dynamic model , as full filling is approached , the double occupancy cost is reduced to @xmath70 . for the parameters chosen in fig .",
    "[ murho ] , @xmath71 is close to zero .",
    "thus we expect the filling of the lattice to be complete when the chemical potential reaches the top of the band , @xmath72 , in good agreement with the plot .",
    "the static hubbard model exhibits antiferromagnetic correlations at half - filling on a bipartite lattice , since only electrons with anti - aligned spins can hop between neighboring sites .",
    "this leads to a lowering of the energy by the exchange energy @xmath73 relative to sites with parallel spin , for which hopping is forbidden .",
    "indeed , a finite size scaling analysis of the structure factor has shown there is long range order in the ground state@xcite . figure  [ af ] compares the value of the antiferomagnetic structure factor @xmath74 for the static and dynamic models . at half - filling",
    ", @xmath74 for the dynamic model attains a maximal value 50% larger than that of the static model .",
    "there is a marked asymmetry in the magnetic response at values greater and lower than @xmath27 in the dynamic model , with @xmath74 remaining high to values of @xmath65 ten percent larger than half - filling .",
    "we also show results for the negative @xmath12 hubbard model , which has no tendency for magnetic order at any filling .",
    "( instead , the attractive hubbard model exhibits long range charge and superconducting correlations at @xmath27 ) .",

    "we turn now to a discussion of superconductivity in the dynamic model . in the static hubbard model",
    ", it has been shown that the @xmath0-wave pairing vertex is repulsive ( positive ) .",
    "the @xmath3-wave vertex is negative , but only relatively weakly so at the temperatures accessible to the simulations@xcite .",
    "near half - filling , the extended @xmath0-wave vertex is also attractive , but markedly less so than @xmath3-wave , suggesting that @xmath3-wave symmetry is the most likely instability .",
    "however , the same sign problem which precludes a definitive statement about superconductivity in the static model also limits what we can conclude here for the dynamic model .",
    "nevertheless , there is an interesting qualitative difference between the two models which can be clearly discerned .    specifically , the extended @xmath0-wave vertex is attractive in the dynamic model in the regime of @xmath24 where @xmath23 is negative , while it is repulsive in the static model at these high fillings . in fig .",

    "the average sign takes the values 0.36 , 0.54 , 0.73 , 0.89 , and 0.96 at @xmath87 .",
    "figure  [ gammasd ] ( top ) shows that , in contrast to the behavior of @xmath88 , the s - wave vertex is strongly repulsive , although @xmath24 does weaken the repulsion somewhat as it increases .",
    "meanwhile , we see in fig.[gammasd ] ( bottom ) that near full filling the @xmath3-wave vertex is more weakly attractive than the @xmath89-wave vertex .",
    "this suggests that if the dynamic hubbard model does have a superconducting instability at small hole - doping that it would be of @xmath89 symmetry , unlike the @xmath3-wave symmetry which is most attractive for the static model@xcite .",
    "it is informative to compare the onset of attraction in the pairing vertex with the development of negative binding energy .",

    "the figure also shows that @xmath51 is relatively insensitive to lattice size : the 2x2 and 6x6 lattices give results which are quantitatively rather similar for most values of @xmath24 .",
    "note also that @xmath88 is strongly repulsive in the static model @xmath86 .",
    "a significantly larger enhancement of superconductivity was reported @xcite in a hubbard hamiltonian in which the hopping of one spin species is modulated by the density of the other .",
    "this model was argued to be connected to the dynamic hubbard hamiltonian in the limit of large @xmath95 .",
    "we conclude this section by exploring the @xmath95 dependence of the pairing vertex , to see if larger @xmath95 might show a greater tendency for superconductivity . in fig .",
    "[ gammavsw0 ] we show the vertices as a function of @xmath95 .",
    "we have fixed the product @xmath96 and @xmath92 so we can stay near the values of @xmath70 where the binding energy is maximized .",
    "the attraction does not seem to increase markedly with @xmath95 .",
    "the total energy ( fig.[etotfull ] ) also shows a markedly different dependence on the density , @xmath65 , in the dynamic hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "whereas the static positive and negative @xmath12 hubbard hamiltonians have @xmath97 , the positive curvature of the dynamic model that is evident below half - filling becomes very small for @xmath61 as @xmath24 increases and eventually the curvature nearly vanishes .",
    "figure  [ etot ] shows this linear behavior developing with @xmath24 .",
    "the temperatures at which we performed our simulations are low enough that the total internal energy , @xmath98 , is nearly equal to the free energy , @xmath99 .",
    "as it is well known , negative curvature in the free energy as a function of the density , in the canonical ensemble , leads to negative compressibility and is thus a signal for phase separation and a first order phase transition@xcite .",
    "thermodynamic stability requires positive curvature for the free energy versus density . while our simulations are performed in the grand canonical ensemble , where such negative curvatures are not observed , we do see ( fig .",
    "[ etot ] ) a progression from positive to zero curvature as @xmath100 . at the same time , and recalling that @xmath101 , we see in fig .",

    "noting that @xmath70 vanishes for @xmath103 and becomes negative when @xmath104 , we interpret these observations as a possible phase separation setting in at @xmath103 whereby the system develops hole - rich and hole - deficient regions .",
    "in this paper we have performed determinant quantum monte carlo simulations of a two dimensional hubbard hamiltonian in which the on - site repulsion is coupled to a fluctuating bosonic field .",
    "our studies complement earlier work using the lang - firsov transformation and exact diagonalization and qmc in one dimension .",
