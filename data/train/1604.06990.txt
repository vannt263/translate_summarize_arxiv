    "the ads / cft correspondence provides us a novel method to analyze a strongly interacting gauge field theory with weakly coupled ads gravity .",
    "it claims that a d - dimensional conformal field theory on the boundary is related to ( d+1)-dimensional ads spacetime in the bulk @xcite . according to this correspondence",
    ", holographic metal and superconductors transition systems have been constructed in the background of ads black hole using @xmath3 correspondences with @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "these gravitational duals have attracted a lot of attentions for their potential applications in condensed matter physics , for references see @xcite-@xcite .    besides the ads black hole , another gravitational configuration ads soliton with the same boundary topology was obtained by a double wick rotation of the ads schwarzschild black hole @xcite .",
    "recently , the holographic insulator and superconductor transition model was also established in the background of five dimensional ads soliton @xcite .",
    "it was shown that if one include a scalar field and a maxwell field coupled in the ads soliton , there is second order phase transition at a critical chemical potential , above which the non - zero scalar operator turns on .",
    "the analysis was performed in the probe limit or the backreaction of the matter fields on the metric was neglected .",
    "considering the backreaction of the matter fields on the soliton background , a first order phase transition was observed when the backreaction is heavy enough @xcite . for other progress",
    ", please see @xcite .",
    "the gravity duals have also been investigated in four dimensional ads soliton @xcite . up to now , holographic superconductors have been constructed in four dimensional or higher dimensional ads soliton .",
    "the existence of a lower dimensional @xmath5 dictionary depends upon the string theory .",
    "but in fact , @xmath5 correspondence is proved to work well in studying the holographic superconductor in the three dimensional ads btz black hole @xcite .",
    "so it is interesting to extend the discussion to three dimensional ads soliton to examine holographic properties .",
    "most of holographic properties were obtained based on numerical solutions since equations of motion are nonlinear and coupled . lately",
    ", analytical methods were also applied to study properties of holographic phase transitions , such as the sturm - liouville variational , the small parameter perturbation and the matching methods , for references see @xcite .",
    "these analytical approaches were proved to be useful to search for critical phase transition points and also qualitative properties .",
    "for example , it showed that the critical chemical potential decreases as we choose a more negative mass in the background of ads soliton @xcite .",
    "since there is usually much more richer potential physics behind an exact formula , we plan to give the critical chemical potential as a function of the scalar mass in exact expression with fully analytical methods in this work .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we construct a holographic superconductor model in the three dimensional ads soliton background in the probe limit .",
    "part a of section iii is devoted to the study of holographic phase transitions by analytical methods .",

    "it was revealed in ref.@xcite that when the chemical potential exceeds a critical value , the condensation will set in .",
    "this procedure was interpreted as insulator / superconductor transitions .",
