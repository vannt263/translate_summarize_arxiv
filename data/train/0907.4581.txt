    "at the tevatron @xmath2 mesons are copiously produced in @xmath5 collisions at a center of mass energy of @xmath6 tev .",
    "having recorded datasets corresponding to an integrated luminosity of more than 5 fb@xmath7 , the two tevatron experiments cdf and d0 are able to perform detailed studies of @xmath2 mesons .",
    "essential for these analyses are triggers that efficiently select events with @xmath2 mesons .",
    "they are identified by decays to @xmath8 mesons with @xmath9 , semileptonic decays to muons ( d0 ) , or hadronic decays with a displaced decay vertex ( cdf ) .",
    "the @xmath2 mesons are a promising place to search for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) because several flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes can be measured in the @xmath2 system .",
    "as there are no fcnc processes at tree level in the sm , new physics contributions may be sizable .",
    "two rare fcnc decay modes of the @xmath2 that are analyzed at the tevatron are @xmath3 and @xmath10 .",
    "another interesting fcnc process is the oscillation of @xmath2 mesons .",
    "it is described by a schrdinger equation @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are @xmath14 hermitian matrices .",
    "the solution are two eigenstates with defined masses , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and decay widths , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively . while the measured oscillation frequency , @xmath19 , agrees well with the ( less precise ) sm prediction , there may still be sizable new physics contributions to the phase @xmath20 .",
    "this would result in a violation of the _ cp _ symmetry in the @xmath2 system , that is expected to be conserved to very good approximation in the sm .",
    "in the sm the fcnc process @xmath3 is predicted to have a branching ratio of @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "a significant enhancement of the branching ratio is expected in several new physics models .",
    "for example in the minimal super - symmetric standard model the @xmath2 branching ratio is proportional to @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the ratio between the vacuum expectation values of the two neutral higgs fields . in @xmath25-parity violating super - symmetric models an enhancement is possible even at low values of @xmath24 .",
    "both tevatron experiments optimize the selection of @xmath3 candidates using simulated signal events and background events from mass sidebands .",
    "while d0 combines the discriminant variables in a boosted decision tree , cdf uses a neural network ( nn ) .",
    "the combinatorial background is estimated by a fit to the mass sidebands . the contribution from decays of @xmath26 mesons to two light hadrons , which could peak in the signal mass region ,",
    "was estimated to be an order of magnitude lower than the combinatorial background . to obtain an absolute branching ratio",
    "the number of signal events is normalized to the high - statistics @xmath27 mode . for the limit calculation cdf",
    "splits the data sample in three bins in nn output and five bins in mass which improves the sensitivity by 15% compared to using just one bin .",
    "the d0 analysis is performed on three separate data samples corresponding to three different detector configurations .",
    "cdf does not see a significant excess ( fig .",
